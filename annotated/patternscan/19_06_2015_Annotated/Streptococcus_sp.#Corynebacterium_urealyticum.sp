TI  == culture-independent identification of pathogenic bacteria and polymicrobial infections in the genitourinary tract of renal transplant recipients.
AB  == renal transplant recipients are predisposed to urinary tract infections caused by both common uropathogens and opportunistic bacteria resulting frequently in significant polymicrobial infections. in this study, a culture-independent 16s rrna-based approach was established to identify unusual, fastidious, or anaerobic bacteria and to investigate bacterial diversity in urinary tract specimens. similarly sized amplicons encompassing the v6 to v8 region of the 16s rrna were analyzed with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dhplc) (wave system). artificial mixtures of single amplicons from commonly encountered uropathogenic bacteria produced distinct peak profiles whose identities were confirmed by sequencing individually collected peak products. we evaluated the application of the method on 109 urinary tract specimens from renal transplant recipients; 100% correlation was found for culture-positive specimens, and dhplc  generated peak profiles. however, for culture-negative specimens, dhplc facilitated the detection of novel peak profiles. dna sequencing of these individual peaks was used to identify the bacteria involved. thus, in pcr-positive but culture-negative samples the method allowed detection of previously known uropathogens such as corynebacterium urealyticum and gardnerella vaginalis, but also unusual agents including anaerococcus lactolyticus, bacteroides vulgatus, dialister invisus, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus iners, leptotrichia amnionii, prevotella buccalis, prevotella ruminicola, rahnella aquatilis, and streptococcus intermedius were detected as single pathogens or as constituents of polymicrobial infections. the method described is reproducible and rapidly and enables both dhplc-based profiling and sequence-based investigation of microbial communities and polymicrobial infections. a detailed understanding of infections found in recipients of renal transplants will guide antibiotic therapy regimens and provide new perspectives for decreasing the risk of graft rejection.

TI  == [development of a selective differential medium for the isolation of corynebacterium urealyticum (group d-2)].
AB  == background: we have developed a new selective culture medium for the isolation of c. urealyticum, with the aim of improving and making easier the isolation and identification of this microorganism. material and methods: the medium is based on components similar to other media, usually used for diagnosis of urinary tract infections, also containing glucose, urea, phenol red, polysorbate 80 (tween 80), polymixin b, amphotericin b, nalidixic acid and lyncomycin. the medium was tested in 65 clinical isolates and three type strains, and in 533 clinical samples of urine. results: all 65 clinical strains and 3 reference strains of c. urealyticum tested grew faster on this medium than on blood agar. e. coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., citrobacter spp., m. morganii, proteus spp., s. aureus, enterococcus spp. and corynebacterium spp. did not grow in the selective agar. s. epidermidis and streptococcus spp. grew in less than 10% of cases, p. aeruginosa  in 29.2% and serratia spp. in 41.7%. the colonies were always easily differentiated from c. urealyticum. in the studies performed on 553 clinical samples from patients with urinary tract infections, six infections by c. urealyticum were detected. the growth of all strains being faster on this medium  than on blood-agar. conclusions: this new selective medium may be a valuable tool for diagnosis of utis caused by c. urealyticum in patients with retard risk factors.

TI  == [comparative bacteriological and chemical analysis of kidney calculi. apropos of  135 cases].
AB  == the formation of some urinary tract stones (struvite stones) is known to be related to infection by urease-possessing microorganisms, such as proteus sp. and some other bacteria. ureaplasma urealyticum, a genital mycoplasma, contains also  urease and is predominantly located in the urogenital tract. its significance in  the production of human urinary stones has not yet been elucidated. in this study, 135 human calculi obtained by surgery were analysed chemically and were cultured for the presence of conventional bacteria and u. urealyticum, 51 were ammonium magnesium phosphate stones and contained proteus (27), e. coli (4), staphylococcus epidermidis (3), streptococcus d (2), pseudomonas aeruginosa (1),  staphylococcus aureus (1), corynebacterium (1), candida albicans (1). u. urealyticum was isolated in one patient, from two different calculi (left and right) taken after an interval of fifteen days. different bacteria were isolated  from other calculi (oxalate, uric acid). this findings suggest that ureaplasma urealyticum should be looked for in struvite calculi.

TI  == vaginitis in sexually active women: relationship to nine sexually transmitted organisms.
AB  == women seen for symptoms suggestive of vulvovaginitis were studied for the detection of mycoplasma hominis. ureaplasma urealyticum, yeast, neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, gardnerella vaginalis, herpes simplex virus,  group b beta-hemolytic streptococci, aerobes, anaerobes, and trichomonas vaginalis. asymptomatic women who reported to be sexually active and agreed to undergo comprehensive genital cultures were used as controls. there was a significant association of vulvovaginitis with the recovery of sexually transmitted organisms. however, all organisms were also recovered from asymptomatic patients. a total of 468 sexually transmitted organisms were recovered from 253 symptomatic patients (1.85 organisms per patient), while 125 were recovered from 130 asymptomatic patients (0.96 organisms per patient). the difference in prevalence between symptomatic and asymptomatic women for chlamydia trachomatis, group b streptococcus, and the mycoplasmas was not statistically significant. factors that predispose patients to the manifestations of symptoms are not clearly understood.

TI  == culture of seminal fluid in a fertility clinic.
AB  == to determine whether the culture of seminal fluid in a fertility clinic is of importance, bacterial cultures were obtained in a consecutive series of 96 patients. routine bacteriologic cultures were performed within 1 hour of collection. ureaplasma urealyticum (t-mycoplasma) cultures were also obtained in  the last 31 of the patients in this series. of these 96 patients, 11% showed significant bacterial growth (greater than 10(4) colonies/ml) in the semen specimens, 8% in those patients with normal semen analyses and 14% in those with  abnormal analyses. fifty-eight per cent of semen specimens were positive for u. urealyticum. in reference to normal and abnormal semen analyses the distribution  was the same regardless of the presence or absence of u. urealyticum. antibiotic  treatment resulted in minor changes in motility and morphology in a few patients  despite conversion to a negative culture. cultures were also coordinated with microscopic urinalysis and the presence of white blood cells or bacteria in stained smears of semen. there were no significant differences between groups with positive or negative cultures. trichomonas vaginalis was not seen.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in semen from fertile and infertile groups  of men.
AB  == semen samples were collected by masturbation under asceptic conditions from men who had sired children within the past 6 mo (group a) and asymptomatic men attending an infertility clinic who had not sired children and whose wives were asymptomatic for infertility (group b). these 109 semen samples were analyzed and cultured for isolation of aerobic and anerobic organisms. overall, 68% of the specimens had positive bacterial cultures: 54% of the samples from group a were positive and 73% from group b were positive. mixed bacterial flora were isolated  from both groups but in group b they were more varied and present in a higher colony count than in group a. staphylococcus epidermidis, staph. aureus, corynebacterium species, mycoplasma hominis, and ureaplasma urealyticum were isolated from group a. group b revealed these organisma plus streptococcus pneumoniae type iii, strep. pyogenes group a, strep. feacalis, escherichia coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, bacteroides species, peptostreptococcus species, and eubacterium species. semen samples from group a were of better quality than those from group  b. in addition, the antibacterial effect of seminal plasma from group a was greater than that from group b.
