TI  == pyuria in patients with kawasaki disease.
AB  == kawasaki disease (kd) is an acute, febrile vasculitis that predominantly develops in children </= 5 years of age and can lead to multiple organ injuries including  the kidneys. of these injuries, pyuria is a common feature of patients with kd, occurring in 30%-80% of patients. sterile pyuria is most common in kd patients </= 1 year of age. kd patients with sterile pyuria exhibit more severe inflammatory reactions and may have sub-clinical renal injuries. sterile pyuria in kd is associated with mononuclear cells (not neutrophils) in the urine. although sterile pyuria in kd was at one time thought to be due to urethritis caused by a non-specific vasculitis of the urethra, recent studies suggest that sterile pyuria in kd originates from the urethra, the kidney as a result of mild  and sub-clinical renal injuries, and/or the bladder due to cystitis. pyuria is not always sterile in kd, but can result from a urinary tract infection (uti). as causative pathogens, escherichia coli and klebsiella oxytoca have been reported.  the clinical phenotypes do not differ between those with or without uti. because  some kd patients with utis have urinary tract abnormalities such as vesicoureteral reflux, a complete uti workup including renal ultrasound, voiding  cystourethrogram and/or dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan recommended in kd patients with utis.

TI  == sensitive, resistant and multi-drug resistant acinetobacter baumanii at saudi arabia hospital eastern region.
AB  == since the physicians start use of antibiotics long ago with un-notice drug resistance. however actual problem was recognized about 85 years ago. antibiotic  resistant and multi-drug resistant bacterial strains are at rise throughout the world. it is physicians and researchers to take scientific research based appropriate action to overcome this ever-spreading problem. this study is designed to find out sensitive (s), resistant (r) and multi-drug resistant (mdr)  acinetobacter baumanii strain along with other isolates in the resident patients  of eastern region of saudi arabia. pseudomonas aeruginosa is excluded from other  gram-negative organisms isolated from different sites as it will be dealt separately. this study is based in was retrospective observations designed to collect data of different stains of acinetobacter baumanii with reference to their sensitivity (s), resistance (r), multi-drug resistance (mdr) along with other gram negative isolated from different sites (from 1st january 2004 to 31st  december 2011) at king abdulaziz hospital located eastern region of kingdom of saudi arabia (ksa). all necessary techniques were used to culture and perform sensitivity of these isolates. there were 4532 isolates out of which 3018 (67%) were from patients. out of acinetobacter baumanii infected were 906 (20%) while other 3626 (80%) isolates were miscellaneous. numbers of patients or cases were 480 (53%) out of 906 isolates and numbers of patients or cases in other organisms were 2538 (70%) out of 3626 isolates. acinetobacter baumanii infected patients 221 (46%) were male and 259 (54%) were female and the male and female ratio of 1:1.2. in other organisms this male female ratio was almost same. there was steady rise in number of patients and the hence the isolates from 2004 to 2011. majority of the bacterial strains were isolated as single organism but some were  isolated as double or triple or quadruple or more organisms from different sites. sensitive, resistant and multi-drug resistant acinetobacter baumanii have been isolated from different sites. the other gram negative isolates included escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, klebsiella oxytoca, serratia marcescens and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. a significant rise in r and mdr but there is rise in r and mdr acinetobacter baumanii strains has been interceded other isolates. it is important to adopt proper and sustainable policies and guideline regarding antibiotics prescription and used. we should also check our infection control practices in our hospital or healthcare settings. we should start antibiotics stewardship in our hospital in order to reducing or overcoming antibiotics resistant (r) and multi-drug resistant (mdr) strains prevalence.

TI  == carriage rates and characteristics of enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in healthy individuals: comparison of applicants for long-term care and individuals screened for employment purposes.
AB  == aims: we compared the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers in the faecal samples of 1,109 healthy individuals screened for employment purposes and in 531 asymptomatic individuals applying for long-term care (ltc). methods: eosin-methylene blue agar plates supplemented with 2 mg/l cefotaxime were used to determine which individuals were esbl producers. esbl phenotype was confirmed by double-disk synergy test and esbl genes were identified by sequencing. esbl producers were characterized by co-resistance and  integron carriage. results: esbl producers were more frequent in the ltc applicants than in the employment screening individuals (7.2 vs. 2.0%; p < 0.0001), with 43 escherichia coli, 18 klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 klebsiella oxytoca and 1 proteus mirabilis being found. in the employment screening individuals, only e. coli was found. most esbl genes (79.4%, 50/63) were blactx-m type; blactx-m-15 was more frequent in the ltc applicants (p < 0.001). regarding esbl genes and integron diversity, e. coli isolates from the ltc applicants were more  similar to k. pneumoniae than to e. coli from the employment screening individuals. conclusion: these differences in the characteristics of esbl producers may represent different sources of colonization. most ltc applicants harboured k. pneumoniae or e. coli that were probably hospital-acquired whereas the e. coli isolates of many healthy individuals showed similarities to environmental e. coli.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of essential oils of cultivated oregano (origanum vulgare), sage (salvia officinalis), and thyme (thymus vulgaris) against clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, and klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  == background: oregano (origanum vulgare), sage (salvia officinalis), and thyme (thymus vulgaris) are aromatic plants with ornamental, culinary, and phytotherapeutic use all over the world. in europe, they are traditionally used in the southern countries, particularly in the mediterranean region. the antimicrobial activities of the essential oils (eos) derived from those plants have captured the attention of scientists as they could be used as alternatives to the increasing resistance of traditional antibiotics against pathogen infections. therefore, significant interest in the cultivation of various aromatic and medicinal plants is recorded during the last years. however, to gain a proper and marketable chemotype various factors during the cultivation should be considered as the geographical morphology, climatic, and farming conditions. in this frame, we have studied the antimicrobial efficiency of the eos from oregano, sage, and thyme cultivated under different conditions in a region of ne  greece in comparison to the data available in literature. methods: plants were purchased from a certified supplier, planted, and cultivated in an experimental field under different conditions and harvested after 9 months. eos were extracted by using a clevenger apparatus and tested for their antibacterial properties (minimum inhibitory concentration - mic) against clinical isolates of multidrug resistant escherichia coli (n=27), klebsiella oxytoca (n=7), and klebsiella pneumoniae (n=16) strains by using the broth microdilution assay. results: our results showed that the most sensitive organism was k. oxytoca with a mean value  of mic of 0.9 microg/ml for oregano eos and 8.1 microg/ml for thyme. the second most sensitive strain was k. pneumoniae with mean mic values of 9.5 microg/ml for thyme and 73.5 microg/ml for oregano eos. e. coli strains were among the most resistant to eos antimicrobial action as the observed mics were 24.8-28.6 microg/ml for thyme and above 125 microg/ml for thyme and sage. most efficient were the eos from thyme followed by those of oregano. conclusions: with mic values above 150 microg/ml, sage eos did not show any antibacterial efficiency against the majority of the strains. however, no significant differences were observed concerning the antimicrobial action of all eos originating from irrigated versus non-irrigated cultivated aromatic plants.

TI  == removal of pathogenic bacterial biofilms by combinations of oxidizing compounds.
AB  == bacterial biofilms are commonly formed on medical devices and food processing surfaces. the antimicrobials used have limited efficacy against the biofilms; therefore, new strategies to prevent and remove these structures are needed. here, the effectiveness of brief oxidative treatments, based on the combination of sodium hypochlorite (naclo) and hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) in the presence of copper sulfate (cuso4), were evaluated against bacterial laboratory strains and clinical isolates, both in planktonic and biofilm states. simultaneous application of oxidants synergistically inactivated planktonic cells and prevented biofilm formation of laboratory escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus strains, as well as clinical isolates of salmonella enterica subsp. enterica, klebsiella oxytoca, and uropathogenic e. coli. in addition, preformed biofilms of e. coli c, salmonella typhimurium, k. pneumoniae, and salmonella enterica exposed to treatments were removed by applying 12 mg/l naclo, 0.1 mmol/l cuso4, and 350 mmol/l h2o2 for 5 min. klebsiella oxytoca and staphylococcus aureus required a 5-fold increase in naclo concentration, and the e. coli clinical isolate remained unremovable unless treatments were applied on biofilms formed within 24 h instead of 48 h. the application of treatments that last a few minutes using oxidizing compounds at low concentrations represents an interesting disinfection strategy against pathogens associated with medical and industrial settings.

TI  == ceftazidime-avibactam activity tested against enterobacteriaceae isolates from u.s. hospitals (2011 to 2013) and characterization of beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  == ceftazidime-avibactam (mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml) inhibited 99.9% (20,698/20,709) of enterobacteriaceae isolates at </=8 mug/ml. this compound was  active against resistant subsets, including ceftazidime-nonsusceptible enterobacter cloacae (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5 mug/ml) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) phenotype isolates. an esbl phenotype was noted among 12.4% (1,696/13,692 isolates from targeted species) of the isolates, including 776 escherichia coli (12.0% for this species; mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml), 721 klebsiella pneumoniae (16.3%; mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml), 119 klebsiella oxytoca (10.3%; mic50/90, 0.06/0.25 mug/ml), and 80 proteus mirabilis (4.9%; mic50/90, 0.06/0.12 mug/ml) isolates. the most common enzymes detected among esbl phenotype isolates from 2013 (n = 743) screened using a microarray-based assay were ctx-m-15-like (n = 307), kpc (n = 120), shv esbls (n = 118), and ctx-m-14-like (n = 110). kpc producers were highly resistant to comparators, and ceftazidime-avibactam (mic50/90, 0.5/2 mug/ml) and tigecycline (mic50/90, 0.5/1 mug/ml; 98.3% susceptible) were the most active agents against these strains. meropenem (mic50/90, </=0.06/</=0.06 mug/ml) and ceftazidime-avibactam (mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml) were active against ctx-m-producing isolates. other enzymes were also observed, and ceftazidime-avibactam displayed good activity against the isolates producing less common enzymes. among 11 isolates displaying ceftazidime-avibactam mic values of >8 mug/ml, three were k. pneumoniae strains producing metallo-beta-lactamases (all ceftazidime-avibactam mics, >32 mug/ml), with two ndm-1 producers and one k. pneumoniae strain carrying the blakpc-2 and blavim-4 genes. therapeutic options for isolates producing beta-lactamases may be limited, and ceftazidime-avibactam, which displayed good activity against strains, including those producing kpc enzymes, merits further study in infections where such organisms occur.

TI  == spectrum of bacterial pathogens and their antibiogram from cases of urinary tract infection among renal disorder patients.
AB  == urinary tract infection (uti) is the commonest bacterial infection occurring in renal disorder patients and is associated with significant morbidity. resistance  to antibiotics is highly prevalent in bacterial isolates and is an emerging problem in uti. a hospital based cross sectional study was conducted from april 2011 to september 2011 to determine the frequency and bacterial profile of urinary tract infections in the patients with renal disorders visiting kist hospital along with their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. urine samples were collected from 300 clinically-suspected cases of uti among renal disorder patients and investigated by conventional semi-quantitative culture technique, microscopy and antibiotic susceptibility test. significant bacteriuria were detected in 34% of the total subjects, mostly from patients with chronic kidney disease. incidence of bacteriuria was found higher in females (40.40%) than in males (27.52%) and mostly occurred in elderly patients. escherichia coli (62.75%) was the predominant isolate followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (10.78%), staphylococcus aureus (9.80%), coagulase negative staphylococcus aureus (cons) (5.88%), enterococcus spp (3.92%), klebsiella oxytoca (2.00%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.00%), proteus mirabilis (2.00%) and proteus vulgaris (1.00%). multidrug resistance was observed in 68.82% of the total bacterial isolates.

TI  == carbapenem-nonsusceptible enterobacteriaceae in taiwan.
AB  == a total of 1135 carbapenem-resistant (nonsusceptible) enterobacteriaceae (cre) isolates were recovered between november 2010 and july 2012 (517 from 2010-2011 and 618 from 2012) from 4 hospitals in taiwan. carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cpe) comprised 5.0% (57 isolates), including 17 kpc-2 (16 klebsiella pneumoniae and 1 escherichia coli), 1 ndm-1 (k. oxytoca), 37 imp-8 (26 enterobacter cloacae, 4 citrobacter freundii, 4 raoultella planticola, 1 k. pneumoniae, 1 e. coli and 1 k. oxytoca), and 2 vim-1 (1 e. cloacae, 1 e. coli). the kpc-2-positive k. pneumoniae were highly clonal even in isolates from different hospitals, and all were st11. imp-8 positive e. cloacae from the same hospitals showed higher similarity in pfge pattern than those from different hospitals. a total of 518 cre isolates (45.6%) were positive for blaesbl, while 704 (62.0%) isolates were blaampc-positive, 382 (33.6% overall) of which carried  both blaesbl and blaampc. ctx-m (414, 80.0%) was the most common blaesbl, while dha (497, 70.6%) and cmy (157, 22.3%) were the most common blaampc. co-carriage of blaesbl and blaampc was detected in 31 (54.4%) and 15 (26.3%) of the 57 cpe, respectively. kpc-2 was the most common carbapenemase detected in k. pneumoniae (2.8%), while imp-8 was the most common in e. cloacae (9.7%). all kpc-2-positive  cre were resistant to all three tested carbapenems. however, fourteen of the 37 imp-8-positive cre were susceptible to both imipenem and meropenem in vitro. intra- and inter-hospital spread of kpc-2-producing k. pneumoniae and imp-8-producing e. cloacae likely occurred. although the prevalence of cpe is still low, careful monitoring is urgently needed. non-susceptibility to ertapenem might need to be considered as one criterion of definition for cre in areas where imp type carbapenemase is prevalent.

TI  == predominance of kpc-3 in a survey for carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae  in portugal.
AB  == among the 2,105 enterobacteriaceae tested in a survey done in portugal, 165 were  nonsusceptible to carbapenems, from which 35 (26 klebsiella pneumoniae, 3 escherichia coli, 2 enterobacter aerogenes, and 3 enterobacter cloacae isolates and 1 klebsiella oxytoca isolate) were confirmed to be carbapenemase producers by the presence of 30 tn4401d-blakpc-3, 4 inti3-blages-5, and one inti1-blavim-2 gene, alone or in combination with other bla genes. the dissemination of blakpc-3 gene carried by an incf plasmid suggests lateral gene transfer as a major mechanism of dissemination.

TI  == oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid treatment in urinary tract infections caused by  extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing organisms.
AB  == background: extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) are increasing problems. the involvement of esbl-producing organisms is associated with higher rates of carbapenem usage in urinary tract infections (utis). though some strains are susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (amc) in vitro, there is very less data about the consequences of amc usage for such infections. objectives: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological outcomes of amc treatment in utis caused by amc-susceptible esbl-producing organisms. patients and methods: a retrospective cohort study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital. forty-six out of 652 patients (f/m ratio: 32/14; mean age: 43.9 years) with esbl-positive utis were eligible for this study. these patients had cystitis (n = 23), vesicoureteral reflux (n = 7), hyperactive bladder (n = 6), and prostatitis (n = 10). data was collected via chart review and was statistically analyzed. results: amc-susceptible esbl-producing escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and k. oxytoca were identified as the causative agents in 31, 14, and 1 patients, respectively. thirty-nine (84.7%) out of 46 patients were successfully treated with oral amc. additionally, 2 (4.3%) patients' urine cultures turned to be negative, though their clinical complaints and leukocyturia had continued. in the remaining 5 (10.8%) patients, no positive clinical and microbiological response was obtained. increased minimum inhibitory concentration levels of amc (from 4 to > 256 microg/ml) were detected in these patients and the treatment failures were attributed to this developing resistance. we found that therapeutic failure was significantly more frequent in klebsiella spp. than in e. coli (33.3% vs 6.5%, p = 0.029). furthermore, no treatment failure was observed in pathogens with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) </= 2 mg/ml, and the high amc mic (8 mg/ml) was associated with resistance development and therapeutic failure (71.4% vs. 5.1%, p = 0.0001). conclusions: our results suggested that amoxicillin-clavulanic acid may be a good oral antimicrobial which can be used for treatment of esbl-positive utis, if the causative agent is susceptible to this antibiotic. however, some strains may develop resistance during therapy, especially in those exhibiting high amc mics.

AB  == aiming to identify new sources of bioactive secondary metabolites, we isolated 82 endophytic fungi from stems and barks of the native brazilian tree caesalpinia echinata lam. (fabaceae). we tested their ethyl acetate extracts in several in vitro assays. the organic extracts from three isolates showed antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli [minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) 32-64 mug/ml]. one isolate inhibited the growth of salmonella typhimurium (mic 64 mug/ml) and two isolates inhibited the growth of klebsiella oxytoca (mic 64 mug/ml), candida albicans and candida tropicalis (mic 64-128 mug/ml). fourteen extracts at a concentration of 20 mug/ml showed antitumour activities against human breast cancer and human renal cancer cells, while two isolates showed anti-tumour activities against human melanoma cancer cells. six extracts were able to reduce the proliferation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, indicating some degree of selective toxicity. four isolates were able to inhibit leishmania (leishmania) amazonensis and one isolate inhibited trypanosoma cruzi by at least 40% at 20 mug/ml. the trypanocidal extract obtained from fusarium sp. [kf611679] culture was subjected to bioguided  fractionation, which revealed beauvericin as the compound responsible for the observed toxicity of fusarium sp. to t. cruzi. this depsipeptide showed a half maximal inhibitory concentration of 1.9 mug/ml (2.43 mum) in a t. cruzi cellular  culture assay.

TI  == utilization of blood cultures in danish hospitals: a population-based descriptive analysis.
AB  == this national population-based study was conducted as part of the development of  a national automated surveillance system for hospital-acquired bacteraemia and ascertains the utilization of blood cultures (bcs). a primary objective was to understand how local differences may affect interpretation of nationwide surveillance for bacteraemia. from the danish microbiology database, we retrieved all bcs taken between 2010 and 2013 and linked these to admission data from the national patient registry. in total, 4 587 295 admissions were registered, and in 11%, at least one bc was taken. almost 50% of bcs were taken at admission. the chance of having a bc taken declined over the next days but increased after 4 days of admission. data linkage identified 876 290 days on which at least one bc  was taken; 6.4% yielded positive results. ten species, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella oxytoca, accounted for 74.7% of agents for this purpose classified as pathogenic. an increase in bcs and positive bcs was observed over time, particularly among older patients. bcs showed a seasonal pattern overall and for s. pneumoniae particularly. a predominance of male patients was seen for bacteraemias due to s. aureus, e. faecium and k. pneumoniae. minor differences in bcs and positive bcs between departments of clinical microbiology underpin the rationale of a future automated surveillance for bacteraemia. the study also provides important knowledge for interpretation of surveillance of invasive infections more generally.

AB  == objectives: klebsiella oxytoca is a member of the family of enterobacteriaceae and often contains the beta-lactamase blaoxy gene. although this beta-lactamase does not naturally hydrolyse ceftazidime, this study describes possible in vivo selection of a clinical k. oxytoca isolate showing increased mics of ceftazidime. methods: to reveal the molecular mechanism underlying this unusual resistance phenotype, wgs, cloning, overexpression, mic and steady-state kinetic studies were performed. results: a patient was treated for a septic episode with ceftazidime (4 g/day). this therapy was based on earlier culture results in which, amongst others, a k. oxytoca (velp-1) isolate was identified. after 11 days of treatment, k. oxytoca velp-2 was isolated from a pus sample drained from  the wound. the isolate showed increased resistance to ceftazidime (mic >/=64 mg/l) compared with the original k. oxytoca isolate (velp-1). wgs revealed the presence of a novel blaoxy-2 allele, designated blaoxy-2-15, with a two amino acid deletion at ambler positions 168 and 169 compared with oxy-2-2. cloning blaoxy-2-15 into escherichia coli top10 resulted in increased mics of ceftazidime, but reduced mics of most other beta-lactams compared with oxy-2-2. steady-state kinetics confirmed the results of the mic data, showing clearly significant ceftazidime hydrolysis. conclusions: this report shows the risk of in vivo selection of ceftazidime-resistant k. oxytoca isolates after prolonged ceftazidime treatment. furthermore, it is the first known report of a k. oxytoca  isolate conferring resistance to ceftazidime by a two amino acid deletion in the  omega loop of oxy-2-2.

TI  == bioactive endophytic fungi isolated from caesalpinia echinata lam. (brazilwood) and identification of beauvericin as a trypanocidal metabolite from fusarium sp.
AB  == aiming to identify new sources of bioactive secondary metabolites, we isolated 82 endophytic fungi from stems and barks of the native brazilian tree caesalpinia echinata lam. (fabaceae). we tested their ethyl acetate extracts in several in vitro assays. the organic extracts from three isolates showed antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli [minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) 32-64 mug/ml]. one isolate inhibited the growth of salmonella typhimurium (mic 64 mug/ml) and two isolates inhibited the growth of klebsiella oxytoca (mic 64 mug/ml), candida albicans and candida tropicalis (mic 64-128 mug/ml). fourteen extracts at a concentration of 20 mug/ml showed antitumour activities against human breast cancer and human renal cancer cells, while two isolates showed anti-tumour activities against human melanoma cancer cells. six extracts were able to reduce the proliferation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, indicating some degree of selective toxicity. four isolates were able to inhibit leishmania (leishmania) amazonensis and one isolate inhibited trypanosoma cruzi by at least 40% at 20 mug/ml. the trypanocidal extract obtained from fusarium sp. [kf611679] culture was subjected to bioguided  fractionation, which revealed beauvericin as the compound responsible for the observed toxicity of fusarium sp. to t. cruzi. this depsipeptide showed a half maximal inhibitory concentration of 1.9 mug/ml (2.43 mum) in a t. cruzi cellular  culture assay.

TI  == characterization of beta-lactamases in faecal enterobacteriaceae recovered from healthy humans in spain: focusing on ampc polymorphisms.
AB  == the intestinal tract is a huge reservoir of enterobacteriaceae, some of which are opportunist pathogens. several genera of these bacteria harbour intrinsic antibiotic resistance genes, such as ampc genes in species of citrobacter, enterobacter or escherichia genera. in this work, beta-lactamases and other resistance mechanisms have been characterized in enterobacteriaceae isolates recovered from healthy human faecal samples, focusing on the ampc beta-lactamase  genes. fifty human faecal samples were obtained, and 70 enterobacteriaceae bacteria were isolated: 44 escherichia coli, 4 citrobacter braakii, 9 citrobacter freundii, 8 enterobacter cloacae, 1 proteus mirabilis, 1 proteus vulgaris, 1 klebsiella oxytoca, 1 serratia sp. and 1 cronobacter sp. a high percentage of resistance to ampicillin was detected (57 %), observing the ampc phenotype in 22  isolates (31 %) and the esbl phenotype in 3 isolates. ampc molecular characterization showed high diversity into bla cmy and bla act genes from citrobacter and enterobacter species, respectively, and the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) analysis demonstrated low clonality among them. the prevalence of people colonized by strains carrying plasmid-mediated ampc genes obtained in this study was 2 %. the unique plasmid-mediated bla ampc identified in this study was the bla cmy-2 gene, detected in an e. coli isolate ascribed to  the sequence type st405 which belonged to phylogenetic group d. the hybridization and conjugation experiments demonstrated that the isecp1-bla cmy-2-blc structure  was carried by a ~78-kb self-transferable inck plasmid. this study shows a high polymorphism among beta-lactamase genes in enterobacteriaceae from healthy people microbiota. extensive ampc-carrier studies would provide important information and could allow the anticipation of future global health problems.

TI  == genetic analysis of maintenance of pec156, a naturally occurring escherichia coli plasmid that carries genes of the ecoviii restriction-modification system.
AB  == in the present study the role of the mechanisms responsible for maintenance of a  natural plasmid pec156, that carries genes of the ecoviii restriction-modification system was investigated. analysis of this plasmid's genetic content revealed the presence of genetic determinants suggesting two such mechanisms. the first of them relies on site specific recombination utilizing the xer/cer molecular machinery, while the second involves a restriction-modification system as an addiction module. our analysis indicated that three factors affect the maintenance of pec156: (i) a cis-acting cer site involved in resolution of plasmid multimers, (ii) a gene coding for ecoviii endonuclease, and (iii) plasmid copy number control. the lowest stability was observed with pec156 derivatives deprived of the cer site. decreased stability of pec156 derivatives was also observed in e.coli strains deficient in genes coding for proteins involved in plasmid multimer resolution (xerc, xerd, argr and pepa). a similar effect, but to a much lesser extent was observed for the pec156 derivative without a functional  gene coding for ecoviii endonuclease. our results indicate that the presence of the cer site is more important for pec156 stable maintenance than the presence of a functional gene coding for ecoviii endonuclease. in our work we also tested maintenance of pec156 possessing a cole1-type replicon in bacteria belonging to enterobacteriaceae family. we have found that pec156 was most stably maintained in enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella oxytoca representing coli-type enterobacteria. we have found that in all enterobacteria tested pec156 derivatives deficient in the cer site were significantly less stably maintained than cer(+) variants.

TI  == antimicrobial co-resistance patterns of gram-negative bacilli isolated from bloodstream infections: a longitudinal epidemiological study from 2002-2011.
AB  == background: increasing multidrug resistance in gram-negative bacilli (gnb) infections poses a serious threat to public health. few studies have analyzed co-resistance rates, defined as an antimicrobial susceptibility profile in a subset already resistant to one specific antibiotic. the epidemiologic and clinical utility of determining co-resistance rates are analyzed and discussed. methods: a 10-year retrospective study from 2002-2011 of bloodstream infections with gnb were analyzed from three hospitals in greater vancouver, bc, canada. descriptive statistics were calculated for antimicrobial resistance and co-resistance. statistical analysis further described temporal trends of antimicrobial resistance, correlations of resistance between combinations of antimicrobials, and temporal trends in co-resistance patterns. results: the total number of unique blood stream isolates of gnb was 3280. increasing resistance to  individual antimicrobials was observed for e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. cloacae, and p. aeruginosa. ciprofloxacin resistance in e. coli peaked in 2006 at 40% and subsequently stabilized at 29% in 2011, corresponding to decreasing ciprofloxacin usage after 2007, as assessed by defined daily dose utilization data. high co-resistance rates were observed for ceftriaxone-resistant e. coli with ciprofloxacin (73%), ceftriaxone-resistant k. pneumoniae with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (83%), ciprofloxacin-resistant e. cloacae with ticarcillin-clavulanate (91%), and piperacillin-tazobactam-resistant p. aeruginosa with ceftazidime (83%). conclusions: increasing antimicrobial resistance was demonstrated over the study period, which may partially be associated with antimicrobial consumption. the study of co-resistance rates in multidrug resistant gnb provides insight into the epidemiology of resistance acquisition, and may be used as a clinical tool to aid prescribing empiric antimicrobial therapy.

AB  == the 89,977 bp nucleotide sequence of pacm1, isolated from a 1993 outbreak strain  of cephalosporin-resistant klebsiella oxytoca, has been completed and assigned genbank accession number kj541681. the plasmid has a single 31,842 bp mosaic multi-drug resistance-encoding (mdr) region comprising the mer resistance module  of tn1696, two integrons with a total of seven cassettes, one complete copy each  of is1r and is26, and the bla(shv-5)-carrying tn2003 (with defective is26 termini), all within a tn1721-like element inserted into the mucb gene of the incl/m plasmid backbone. the tn1721-tn1696 combination resembles sequence found in the chromosomal mdr islands of some acinetobacter baumannii isolates. among the completely sequenced incl/m resistance plasmids, the tn1721-based mdr region  is unique, but data from older studies suggest that this type of plasmid was widespread in the 1990s. since resistance gene dosage is affected by plasmid copy number (pcn), we used a relatively simple new "efficiency-corrected" qpcr assay to measure the pcn of pacm1. there are approximately three copies per chromosome  in an escherichia coli dh5alpha host, and two in the original klebsiella oxytoca  isolate. we could not find similar pcn data for other medically important plasmids for comparison. the study of this plasmid property and its effect on resistance levels should be facilitated in the future by the availability of qpcr instruments and complete genome sequences.

TI  == single-molecule sequencing to track plasmid diversity of hospital-associated carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == public health officials have raised concerns that plasmid transfer between enterobacteriaceae species may spread resistance to carbapenems, an antibiotic class of last resort, thereby rendering common health care-associated infections  nearly impossible to treat. to determine the diversity of carbapenemase-encoding  plasmids and assess their mobility among bacterial species, we performed comprehensive surveillance and genomic sequencing of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae in the national institutes of health (nih) clinical center patient population and hospital environment. we isolated a repertoire of carbapenemase-encoding enterobacteriaceae, including multiple strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and pantoea species. long-read genome sequencing with full end-to-end assembly revealed that these organisms carry the carbapenem  resistance genes on a wide array of plasmids. k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae isolated simultaneously from a single patient harbored two different carbapenemase-encoding plasmids, indicating that plasmid transfer between organisms was unlikely within this patient. we did, however, find evidence of horizontal transfer of carbapenemase-encoding plasmids between k. pneumoniae, e.  cloacae, and c. freundii in the hospital environment. our data, including full plasmid identification, challenge assumptions about horizontal gene transfer events within patients and identify possible connections between patients and the hospital environment. in addition, we identified a new carbapenemase-encoding plasmid of potentially high clinical impact carried by k. pneumoniae, e. coli, e. cloacae, and pantoea species, in unrelated patients and in the hospital environment.

TI  == rapid identification of carbapenemase genes in gram-negative bacteria with an oligonucleotide microarray-based assay.
AB  == rapid molecular identification of carbapenemase genes in gram-negative bacteria is crucial for infection control and prevention, surveillance and for epidemiological purposes. furthermore, it may have a significant impact upon determining the appropriate initial treatment and greatly benefit for critically  ill patients. a novel oligonucleotide microarray-based assay was developed to simultaneously detect genes encoding clinically important carbapenemases as well  as selected extended (esbl) and narrow spectrum (nsbl) beta-lactamases directly from clonal culture material within few hours. additionally, a panel of species specific markers was included to identify escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter freundii/braakii, klebsiella pneumoniae and acinetobacter baumannii. the assay was tested using a panel of 117 isolates collected from urinary, blood and stool samples. for these isolates, phenotypic identifications  and susceptibility tests were available. an independent detection of carbapenemase, esbl and nsbl genes was carried out by various external reference  laboratories using pcr methods. in direct comparison, the microarray correctly identified 98.2% of the covered carbapenemase genes. this included blavim (13 out of 13), blagim (2/2), blakpc (27/27), blandm (5/5), blaimp-2/4/7/8/13/14/15/16/31 (10/10), blaoxa-23 (12/13), blaoxa-40-group (7/7), blaoxa-48-group (32/33), blaoxa-51 (1/1) and blaoxa-58 (1/1). furthermore, the test correctly identified additional beta-lactamases [blaoxa-1 (16/16), blaoxa-2 (4/4), blaoxa-9 (33/33), oxa-10 (3/3), blaoxa-51 (25/25), blaoxa-58 (2/2), ctx-m1/m15 (17/17) and blavim (1/1)]. in direct comparison to phenotypical identification obtained by vitek or  maldi-tof systems, 114 of 117 (97.4%) isolates, including acinetobacter baumannii (28/28), enterobacter spec. (5/5), escherichia coli (4/4), klebsiella pneumoniae  (62/63), klebsiella oxytoca (0/2), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12/12), citrobacter freundii (1/1) and citrobacter braakii (2/2), were correctly identified by a panel of species specific probes. this assay might be easily extended, adapted and transferred to point of care platforms enabling fast surveillance, rapid detection and appropriate early treatment of infections caused by multiresistant  gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == e. coli, k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca community-acquired infections susceptibility to cephalosporins and other antimicrobials in lebanon.
AB  == objectives: cephalosporin resistance in enterobacteriaceae has become an international concern. this article studies the distribution and trends of resistance of e. coli and klebsiella species isolated from clinical specimens representing community-acquired infections. methods: e. coli, k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca specimen strains were collected from patients presenting to three acute care hospitals in lebanon. the study period extended from january 2010 to january 2011 and included patients presenting with community-acquired infections  only. automated microbiological system (vitek 2) was used for identification and  antimicrobial susceptibilities. results: data from consecutive non-duplicate 589  e. coli, 54 k. pneumoniae and 40 k. oxytoca strains were collected of which 69.5%, 74.0% and 67.5% were susceptible to 3rd generation cephalosporins (3gc), respectively. out of the 3gc-resistant e. coli strains, around 90% were susceptible to nitrofurantoin, 46% were susceptible to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (tmp/smx) and 53% to ciprofloxacin. the patterns of antimicrobial susceptibility in the two klebsiella species did not parallel those in the e. coli strains. yet, the number of klebsiella strains was much lower than that of e. coli. of note is that the 3gc-resistant strains of both klebsiella species were less susceptible to nitrofurantoin compared to the overall groups reaching a maximum of 30%. however, susceptibility to tmp/smx was much higher reaching 79% and that of ciprofloxacin reaching 86%. conclusion: clinical specimens of e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca, causing community-acquired infections in lebanon showed that these organisms are significantly resistant to many antibiotics. these patterns of resistance were mainly to internationally recommended drugs for empiric treatment of community-acquired infections like community-acquired urinary tract infections (utis) and intra-abdominal infections. therefore, continuous antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance is advisable to track emerging resistance in enterobacteriaceae and national guidelines would be tailored accordingly.

TI  == bioresorbable ureteral stents from natural origin polymers.
AB  == in this work, stents were produced from natural origin polysaccharides. alginate, gellan gum, and a blend of these with gelatin were used to produce hollow tube (stents) following a combination of templated gelation and critical point carbon  dioxide drying. morphological analysis of the surface of the stents was carried out by scanning electron microscopy. indwelling time, encrustation, and stability of the stents in artificial urine solution was carried out up to 60 days of immersion. in vitro studies carried out with simulated urine demonstrated that the tubes present a high fluid uptake ability, about 1000%. despite this, the materials are able to maintain their shape and do not present an extensive swelling behavior. the bioresorption profile was observed to be highly dependent  on the composition of the stent and it can be tuned. complete dissolution of the  materials may occur between 14 and 60 days. additionally, no encrustation was observed within the tested timeframe. the ability to resist bacterial adherence was evaluated with gram-positive staphylococcus aureus and two gram-negatives escherichia coli dh5 alpha and klebsiella oxytoca. for k. oxytoca, no differences were observed in comparison with a commercial stent (biosoft((r)) duo, porges), although, for s. aureus all tested compositions had a higher inhibition of bacterial adhesion compared to the commercial stents. in case of e. coli, the addition of gelatin to the formulations reduced the bacterial adhesion in a highly significant manner compared to the commercial stents. the stents produced  by the developed technology fulfill the requirements for ureteral stents and will contribute in the development of biocompatible and bioresorbable urinary stents.

TI  == ceftolozane/tazobactam activity tested against aerobic gram-negative organisms isolated from intra-abdominal and urinary tract infections in european and united states hospitals (2012).
AB  == ceftolozane/tazobactam is under clinical development for treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (iai), complicated urinary tract infections (uti) and  ventilator-associated pneumonia. we evaluated the in vitro activity of ceftolozane/tazobactam and comparator agents tested against gram-negative aerobic bacteria causing iai and healthcare-associated uti (hca-uti). the organisms were  consecutively collected from january to december 2012 from 59 medical centers located in the united states (usa) and 15 european countries by the program to assess ceftolozane/tazobactam susceptibility (pacts). the collection included 809 organisms from iai and 2474 organisms from hca-uti, and susceptibility testing was performed by reference broth microdilution methods as described by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) m07-a9 document. overall, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most  frequently isolated pathogens from both infection types. ceftolozane/tazobactam was very active against e. coli (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5 mg/l; 98.5-99.9% inhibited at an mic of </=8 mg/l) and retained activity against many of the multidrug-resistant (mdr; mic50/90, 0.5/2->32 mg/l) and esbl-phenotype strains (mic50/90, 0.5/2-32 mg/l). ceftolozane/tazobactam was active against most k. pneumoniae strains (mic50/90, 0.25/16 mg/l, 88.9-89.6% inhibited at an mic of </=8 mg/l), but some esbl-phenotype (mic50/90, 4-8/>32 mg/l) and mdr (mic50/90, 16/>32 mg/l) isolates exhibited elevated mic values. ceftolozane/tazobactam was the most active agent tested against p. aeruginosa (mic50/90, 0.5/4 mg/l; 93.4-95.7% inhibited at </=8 mg/l) and retained potency against many mdr (mic50/90, 2-4/>32 mg/l), ceftazidime-nonsusceptible (mic50/90, 2-4/>32 mg/l) and meropenem-nonsusceptible (mic50/90, 2/>32 mg/l) strains. ceftolozane/tazobactam was also active against klebsiella oxytoca (mic50/90, </=0.12-0.25/0.5-1 mg/l), enterobacter spp. (mic50/90, 0.25-0.5/4-8 mg/l), citrobacter spp. (mic50/90, 0.25/2-32 mg/l), proteus mirabilis (mic50/90, 0.5/0.5 mg/l), indole-positive proteae (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5-1 mg/l), and serratia spp. (mic50/90, 0.5/1-2 mg/l).  in summary, ceftolozane/tazobactam demonstrated potent in vitro activity when tested against contemporary aerobic gram-negative pathogens causing iai and hca-uti in usa and european medical centers.

TI  == high incidence and endemic spread of ndm-1-positive enterobacteriaceae in henan province, china.
AB  == the emergence and spread of new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (ndm-1)-producing  carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae (cre) present an urgent threat to human health. in china, the bla(ndm-1 gene has been reported mostly in acinetobacter spp. but is rarely found in enterobacteriaceae. here, we report a high incidence  and endemic spread of ndm-1-producing cre in henan province in china. sixteen (33.3%) of the 48 cre isolates obtained from patients during june 2011 to july 2012 were positive for bla(ndm-1), and the gene was found to be carried on plasmids of various sizes ( approximately 55 to approximately 360 kb). these plasmids were readily transferrable to recipient escherichia coli by conjugation, conferred resistance to multiple antibiotics, and belonged to multiple replicon types. the bla(ndm-1)-positive cre isolates were genetically diverse, and six new multilocus sequence typing (mlst) sequence types were linked to the carriage of ndm-1. five of the isolates were classified as extensively drug-resistant (xdr) isolates, four of which also carried the fosa3 gene conferring resistance to fosfomycin, an alternative drug for treating infections by cre. in each bla(ndm-1)-positive cre isolate, the bla(ndm-1) gene was downstream of an intact  isaba125 element and upstream of the blembl gene. furthermore, gene environment analysis suggested the possible transmission of bla(ndm-1)-containing sequences from acinetobacter spp. to klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca. these findings reveal the emergence and active transmission of ndm-1-positive cre in china and underscore the need for heightened measures to control their further spread.

TI  == pediatric multicenter evaluation of the verigene gram-negative blood culture test for rapid detection of inpatient bacteremia involving gram-negative organisms, extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases.
AB  == we evaluated the investigational use only (iuo) version of the rapid verigene gram-negative blood culture test (bc-gn), a microarray that detects 9 genus/species targets (acinetobacter spp., citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., escherichia coli/shigella spp., klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens) and 6 antimicrobial resistance determinants (blactx-m, blakpc, blandm, blavim, blaimp,  and blaoxa) directly from positive blood cultures. bc-gn was performed on positive bact/alert pediatric fan and bactec peds plus blood cultures with gram-negative organisms at two tertiary pediatric centers. vitek ms (biomerieux,  durham, nc) was used to assign gold standard organism identification. the check mdr ct-102 microarray (check points b.v., wageningen, netherlands) was used as an alternative method for detecting resistance determinants. in total, 104 organisms were isolated from 97 clinical blood cultures. bc-gn correctly detected 26/26 cultures with acinetobacter spp., p. aeruginosa, and s. marcescens, 5/6 with citrobacter spp., 13/14 with enterobacter spp., 23/24 with e. coli, 2/3 with k. oxytoca, 16/17 with k. pneumoniae, and 0/1 with proteus spp. bc-gn appropriately  reported negative bc-gn results in 8/13 blood cultures that grew organisms that were not represented on the microarray but failed to detect targets in 3/5 cultures that grew multiple gram-negative organisms. bc-gn detected 5/5 and 1/1 clinical blood cultures with blactx-m and blavim. all 6 results were corroborated by check mdr ct-102 microarray testing. the verigene bc-gn test has the potential to expedite therapeutic decision making in pediatric patients with gram-negative  bacteremia. sensitivity was satisfactory but may be suboptimal in mixed gram-negative blood cultures.

TI  == independent domain assembly in a trapped folding intermediate of multimeric outer membrane secretins.
AB  == the outer membrane portal of the klebsiella oxytoca type ii secretion system, puld, is a prototype of a family of proteins, the secretins, which are essential  components of many bacterial secretion and pilus assembly machines. puld is a homododecamer with a periplasmic vestibule and an outer chamber on either side of a membrane-spanning region that is poorly resolved by electron microscopy. membrane insertion involves the formation of a dodecameric membrane-embedded intermediate. here, we describe an amino acid substitution in puld that blocks its assembly at this intermediate "prepore" stage. electron microscopy indicated  that the prepore has an apparently normal periplasmic vestibule but a poorly organized outer chamber. a peptide loop around this amino acid appears to be important for the formation/stability of the fully folded complex. a similar assembly intermediate results from creation of the same amino acid substitution in the pseudomonas aeruginosa secretin xcpq.

TI  == prevalence of significant bacteriuria among symptomatic and asymptomatic homozygous sickle cell disease patients in a tertiary hospital in lagos, nigeria.
AB  == background: patients with sickle cell disease have an amplified vulnerability to  urinary tract infection, because of abnormally dilute and alkaline urine, which favors bacterial proliferation. this is due to altered blood flow in the renal vasculature, which causes papillary necrosis and loss of urinary concentrating and acidifying ability of the nephrons. asymptomatic bacteriuria is common, but the prevalence in populations varies widely with age, gender, sexual activity and the presence of genitourinary abnormalities. the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of significant bacteriuria in symptomatic and asymptomatic sickle cell patients in lagos. materials and methods: this was a cross-sectional study of patients attending the sickle cell clinics of lagos state university teaching hospital, ikeja. single voided aseptically collected mid-stream urine was obtained from each patient and all samples processed immediately, were sent for urinalysis and culture. isolates were considered significant if there were >/=10 5 colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) with two or less isolates, doubtful significance if </=10 5 cfu/ml. significant isolates were selected for identification. data were analyzed using the statistical package for social sciences (spss) version 16.0 (spss, inc., chicago, ill). results: a total of 100 consenting participants were recruited into the study. the mean age was: 23.42 +/- 8.31 years and a range of 14-50 years. only 9% (9/100) had significant bacteriuria while 44.4% (4/9) participants who had significant bacteriuria were asymptomatic. escherichia coli was isolated in 66.6% (6/9) participants who had significant bacteriuria while klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumonia and staphylococcus aureus (11.11%) was isolated in each of the remaining three participants. conclusions: significant bacteriuria is found in only one-tenth of sickle cell patients, nearly half of the participants who had significant growth had asymptomatic bacteriuria.

AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is a major human pathogen that successfully adapts to the host environment via an efficient uptake system for free dna liberated from other organisms in the upper respiratory tract, facilitating immune evasion and drug resistance. although the initial signaling events leading to pneumococcal competence for dna transformation and the fate of dna when it has been taken up have been extensively studied, the actual mechanism by which dna in the environment may traverse the thick capsular and cell wall layers remains unknown. here we visualize that induction of competence results in the formation of a native morphologically distinct pilus structure on the bacterial surface. this plaited pilus is encoded by the competence (com)g locus, and, after assembly, it  is rapidly released into the surrounding medium. heterologous pneumococcal pilus  expression in escherichia coli was obtained by replacing the pule-k putative pilin genes of the klebsiella oxytoca type ii secretion system with the complete  comg locus. in the pneumococcus, the coordinated secretion of pili from the cells correlates to dna transformation. a model for dna transformation is proposed whereby pilus assembly "drills" a channel across the thick cell wall that becomes transiently open by secretion of the pilus, providing the entry port for exogenous dna to gain access to dna receptors associated with the cytoplasmic membrane.

TI  == [carbapenem resistance in esbl positive enterobacteriaceae isolates causing invasive infections].
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the presence of carbapenem resistance in enterobacteriaeceae isolates recovered from invasive infections, in hacettepe university hospital, ankara, turkey, between 2005-2009, by phenotypic and genotypic methods. a total of 210 non-duplicated escherichia coli (n= 153), klebsiella pneumoniae (n= 47) and klebsiella oxytoca (n= 10) isolates which were  all determined to be extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) positive with the bd phoenix automated identification and antibiotic susceptibility system (sparks, usa), were included in the study. the isolates were recovered from patients with  bloodstream infections. susceptibility of the isolates to imipenem, meropenem and ertapenem was detected with microdilution method according to the standards of clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) breakpoints. doripenem susceptibility was detected by the e-test (biomerieux, hazelwood, usa). all isolates which were found to be non-susceptible to any of the carbapenem antibiotics tested, were characterized by the phenotypic confirmatory tests and the presence of the resistance genes; blaampc, blactx-m, blakpc, blandm, blaoxa, blaimp ve blavim were screened by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). among the 210 esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae  blood isolates, 23 (11%) were identified as non-susceptible to any of the carbapenems tested. resistance rates for imipenem, meropenem and ertapenem were 5.7% (n= 12), 1.9% (n= 4) and 2.4% (n= 5), respectively. doripenem was more active than the other carbapenems, with a resistance rate of 1.0%. seven of 23 isolates were esbl negative with cefotaxime/clavulanic acid (ctx/cla) and ceftazidime/clavulanic acid (caz/cla) combined disk diffusion test, however, six  of them were esbl positive with the addition of boronic acid (ba) to ctx/cla. among the three isolates positive for modifiye hodge test (mht) and/or ertapenem-ba tests, blaoxa-48 was detected in one and blaampc in the other. phenotypic pampc activity was present in three k.pneumoniae isolates of which one was positive for blaampc gene. one k.pneumoniae isolate resistant to all carbapenems with mics > 256 microg/ml and positive for phenotypic meropenem-ba, mht, imipenem-edta, ceftazidime-caz/cla, cefoxitin-ba production, was found to inhabit blaoxa-48 gene. five isolates were positive for blaoxa-1 and one for blaoxa-10. two isolates were positive for blactx-m, however blaimp, blavim and blandm-1 genes were not detected among the isolates. in conclusion, carbapenem non-susceptibility which was low among the enterobacteriaceae strains isolated in our center, was mostly attributed to the presence of blaoxa type carbapenemases and no accumulation of blakpc and blandm were detected.

TI  == evaluation of the clinical and laboratory standards institute phenotypic confirmatory test to detect the presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases from 4005 escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis isolates.
AB  == a subset of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis isolates collected for the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends that were positive for the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) phenotypic confirmatory  test (n = 3245) or had an ertapenem mic of >/=0.5 microg ml(-1) (n = 293), or both (n = 467), were analysed for esbl genes. most esbl phenotype e. coli or k. pneumoniae possessed an esbl gene (95.8 and 88.4 %, respectively), and this was 93.1 % if carbapenem-non-susceptible k. pneumoniae were removed. this rate was lower for p. mirabilis (73.4 %) and k. oxytoca (62.5 %). virtually all esbl-positive isolates (99.5 %) were cefotaxime non-susceptible [clsi or european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) breakpoints)]. fewer isolates (82 %) were ceftazidime non-susceptible (clsi breakpoints). in addition, 21.1 % of e. coli, 25 % of k. oxytoca and 78.7 % of p. mirabilis isolates were ceftazidime susceptible but esbl positive. this suggests that clsi breakpoints for ceftazidime are too high to detect esbls. the lower eucast breakpoints detected esbls in e. coli and k. oxytoca better, but 59.6 % of esbl-positive isolates of p. mirabilis were ceftazidime susceptible. for isolates with ertapenem mics >/=0.5 microg ml(-1), more accurate esbl phenotype analysis was observed for e. coli and k. pneumoniae (sensitivity >95 % for both, specificity 94.4 and 54.1 %, respectively). if carbapenemase-positive k. pneumoniae were excluded, the specificity increased to 78 %. the positive predictive values for the esbl phenotypic test with e. coli and k. pneumoniae were 97.6 and 81.8 %, respectively, and negative predictive values were 75.9 and 95.2 %, respectively.  we therefore suggest that it would be prudent to confirm phenotypic esbl-positive p. mirabilis, k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca with molecular analysis.

TI  == emergence of carbapenemaseproducing klebsiella pneumoniae of sequence type 258 in michigan, usa.
AB  == the prevalence of carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cpe) in our hospital increased beginning in 2009. we aimed to study the clinical and molecular epidemiology of these emerging isolates. we performed a retrospective review of all adult patients with clinical cultures confirmed as cpe by positive  modified hodge test from 5/2009- 5/2010 at the university of michigan health system (umhs). clinical information was obtained from electronic medical records. available cpe isolates were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and sequencing of the 16s rrna encoding gene and bla kpc locus. multilocus sequence typing (mlst) was used to characterize klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. twenty six unique cpe isolates were obtained from 25 adult patients. the majority were klebsiella pneumoniae (n=17). other isolates included k. oxytoca (n=3), citrobacter freundii (n=2), enterobacter cloacae (n=2), enterobacter aerogenes (n=1) and escherichia coli (n=1). molecular characterization of 19 available cpe  isolates showed that 13 (68%) carried the kpc-3 allele and 6 (32%) carried the kpc-2 allele. among 14 available k. pneumoniae strains, 12 (86%) carried the kpc-3 allele and belonged to a common lineage, sequence type (st) 258. the other  2 (14%) k. pneumoniae isolates carried the kpc-2 allele and belonged to two unique sts. among these st 258 strains, 67% were isolated from patients with prior exposures to health care settings outside of our institution. in contrast,  all cpe isolates carrying the kpc-2 allele and all non st 258 cpe isolates had acquisition attributable to our hospital. molecular epidemiology of carbapenemase producing k. pneumoniae suggests that kpc-3 producing k. pneumoniae isolates of a common lineage, sequence type (st 258), are emerging in our hospital. while st 258 is a dominant sequence type throughout the united states, this study is the first to report its presence in michigan.

TI  == characterization of kpc-2-producing escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and klebsiella oxytoca isolates from a chinese hospital.
AB  == twelve nonduplicated kpc-2-producing enterobacterial isolates, including three escherichia coli, two citrobacter freundii, two enterobacter cloacae, four enterobacter aerogenes, and one klebsiella oxytoca, were collected from various clinical samples within 18 months (march 2011 to september 2012). two of the 12 patients died from infections caused by kpc-2-producing pathogens, while the rest of the patients with kpc-2-producing pathogens improved or were cured. the majority of the clinical isolates exhibited a high-level of resistance to oxyimino-cephalosporins and carbapenems, and possessed self-transferable bla(kpc-2)-carrying plasmids with sizes ranging from 20 to 120 kb. most isolates  carried bla(ctx-m) and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes, while some isolates produced 16s rrna methylases (arma or rmtb). the genetic environment of  bla(kpc-2) of most clinical strains was consistent with the genetic structure surrounding bla(kpc-2) on the plasmid pkp048, which contains an integration structure of a tn3-based transposon and partial tn4401 segment. inserted fragments (truncated bla(tem)) were detected upstream of the bla(kpc-2) gene for  two e. aerogenes strains. in conclusion, the enterobacterial isolates exhibited sporadic emergence and did not arise by clonal spread at our hospital. the outcome of infections caused by kpc-producing enterobacterial isolates and their  mortality were closely associated with the baseline condition of patients. the spread of bla(kpc-2) gene between different enterobacterial species in china was  mainly mediated by horizontal transfer of the tn3-based transposons and not the bla(kpc-2)-carrying plasmids.

TI  == identification of acetoin reductases involved in 2,3-butanediol pathway in klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  == the acetoin reductase (ar) of klebsiella oxytoca is responsible for converting acetoin into 2,3-butanediol (2,3-bdo) during sugar fermentation. deleting the ar  encoding gene (budc) in the 2,3-bdo operon does not block production of 2,3-bdo,  as another similar gene exists in addition to budc called diacetyl/acetoin reductase (dar) which shares 53% identity with budc. in the present study, both budc and dar of k. oxytoca were independently cloned and expressed in escherichia coli along with buda (acetolactate decarboxylase) and budb (acetolactate synthase), which are responsible for converting pyruvate into acetoin. the recombinant e. coli expressing budabc and budab-dar produced 2,3-bdo from glucose but e. coli expressing only budab did not and produced acetoin alone. this demonstrates that dar functions similar to budc. mutants of budc, dar, and both genes together were developed in k. oxytoca deltaldha (lactate dehydrogenase). k. oxytoca deltaldha deltabudc deltadar, deficient in both ar genes, showed reduced  2,3-bdo concentration when compared to k. oxytoca deltaldha and k. oxytoca deltaldha deltabudc by 84% and 69%, respectively. interestingly, k. oxytoca deltaldha deltadar resulted in a significant reduction in the reversible conversion of 2,3-bdo into acetoin than that of k. oxytoca deltaldha, which was observed in a glucose depleted fermentation culture. in addition, we observed that dar played a key role in dissimilation of 2,3-bdo in media containing 2,3-bdo alone.

TI  == contemporary diversity of beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae in the nine u.s. census regions and ceftazidime-avibactam activity tested against isolates producing the most prevalent beta-lactamase groups.
AB  == escherichia coli (328 isolates), klebsiella pneumoniae (296), klebsiella oxytoca  (44), and proteus mirabilis (33) isolates collected during 2012 from the nine u.s. census regions and displaying extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (esbl) phenotypes were evaluated for the presence of beta-lactamase genes, and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were analyzed. the highest esbl rates were  noted for k. pneumoniae (16.0%, versus 4.8 to 11.9% for the other species) and in the mid-atlantic and west south central census regions. ctx-m group 1 (including  ctx-m-15) was detected in 303 strains and was widespread throughout the united states but was more prevalent in the west south central, mid-atlantic, and east north central regions. kpc producers (118 strains [112 k. pneumoniae strains]) were detected in all regions and were most frequent in the mid-atlantic region (58 strains). thirteen kpc producers also carried blactx-m. shv genes encoding esbl activity were detected among 176 isolates. other beta-lactamase genes observed were ctx-m group 9 (72 isolates), fox (10), tem esbl (9), dha (7), ctx-m group 2 (3), ndm-1 (2 [colorado]), and ctx-m groups 8 and 25 (1). additionally, 62.9% of isolates carried >/=2 beta-lactamase genes. kpc producers were highly resistant to multiple agents, but ceftazidime-avibactam (mic50/90, 0.5/2 mug/ml)  and tigecycline (mic50/90, 0.5/1 mug/ml) were the most active agents tested. overall, meropenem (mic50, </=0.06 mug/ml), ceftazidime-avibactam (mic50, 0.12 to 0.5 mug/ml), and tigecycline (mic50, 0.12 to 2 mug/ml) were the most active antimicrobials when tested against this collection. ndm-1 producers were resistant to all beta-lactams tested. the diversity and increasing prevalence of  beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae have been documented, and ceftazidime-avibactam was very active against the vast majority of beta-lactamase-producing strains isolated from u.s. hospitals.

TI  == sequencing, characterization, and gene expression analysis of the histidine decarboxylase gene cluster of morganella morganii.
AB  == the histidine decarboxylase gene cluster of morganella morganii dsm30146(t) was sequenced, and four open reading frames, named hdct1, hdc, hdct2, and hisrs were  identified. two putative histidine/histamine antiporters (hdct1 and hdct2) were located upstream and downstream the hdc gene, codifying a pyridoxal-p dependent histidine decarboxylase, and followed by hisrs gene encoding a histidyl-trna synthetase. this organization was comparable with the gene cluster of other known gram negative bacteria, particularly with that of klebsiella oxytoca. recombinant escherichia coli strains harboring plasmids carrying the m. morganii hdc gene were shown to overproduce histidine decarboxylase, after iptg induction at 37 degrees c for 4 h. quantitative rt-pcr experiments revealed the hdc and hisrs genes were highly induced under acidic and histidine-rich conditions. this work represents the first description and identification of the hdc-related genes in m. morganii. results support the hypothesis that the histidine decarboxylation reaction in this prolific histamine producing species may play a role in acid survival. the knowledge of the role and the regulation of genes involved in histidine decarboxylation should improve the design of rational strategies to avoid toxic histamine production in foods.

TI  == long-term dissemination of acquired ampc beta-lactamases among klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli in portuguese clinical settings.
AB  == we investigated the occurrence, diversity and molecular epidemiology of genes coding for acquired ampc beta-lactamases (qampc) among clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae lacking inducible chromosomal ampcs in portugal. a total of 675 isolates non-susceptible to broad-spectrum cephalosporins obtained from four  hospitals and three community laboratories during a 7-year period (2002-2008) were analysed. the presence of genes coding for qampc was investigated by phenotypic criteria, polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and sequencing. bacterial identification, antibiotic susceptibility testing, conjugation assays and clonal  analysis were performed by standard procedures. the presence of bla(qampc) genes  was detected in 50 % (50/100; 41 klebsiella pneumoniae, 5 escherichia coli, 4 klebsiella oxytoca) of the presumptive qampc producers. dha-1, detected in those  species, was the most prevalent qampc (94 %, 47/50), being identified since 2003  and throughout the studied period in different institutions. despite the high clonal diversity observed, three dha-1-producing klebsiella spp. clones were more frequently identified. cmy-2 (6 %, 3/50) was observed in b1-e. coli clones. conjugative transfer was only observed in one (2 %) cmy-2-producing isolate. most qampc producers (94 %, 47/50) co-expressed shv-type and/or oxa-1 or ctx-m-32 extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls). to the authors' knowledge, this is the first description of the molecular epidemiology and the long-term dissemination of qampc-producing enterobacteriaceae in portuguese clinical settings, highlighting an evolution towards a more complex epidemiological situation regarding cephalosporin resistance in portugal.

TI  == evaluation of the betalacta test, a rapid test detecting resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in clinical strains of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == for decades, third-generation cephalosporins (3gc) have been major drugs used to  treat infections due to enterobacteriaceae; growing resistance to these antibiotics makes the rapid detection of such resistance important. the betalacta test is a chromogenic test developed for detecting 3gc-resistant isolates from cultures on solid media within 15 min. a multicenter prospective study conducted  in 5 french and belgian hospitals evaluated the performance of this test on clinical isolates. based on antibiotic susceptibility testing, strains resistant  or intermediate to cefotaxime or ceftazidime were classified as 3gc resistant, and molecular characterization of this resistance was performed. the rates of 3gc resistance were 13.9% (332/2,387) globally, 9.4% in escherichia coli (132/1,403), 25.6% in klebsiella pneumoniae (84/328), 30.3% in species naturally producing inducible ampc beta-lactamases (109/360), and 5.6% in klebsiella oxytoca and citrobacter koseri (7/124). the sensitivities and specificities of the betalacta  test were, respectively, 87.7% and 99.6% overall, 96% and 100% for e. coli and k. pneumoniae, and 67.4% and 99.6% for species naturally producing inducible ampc beta-lactamase. false-negative results were mainly related to 3gc-resistant strains producing ampc beta-lactamase. interestingly, the test was positive for all 3gc-resistant extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing isolates (n = 241).  the positive predictive value was 97% and remained at >/=96% for prevalences of 3gc resistance ranging between 10 and 30%. the negative predictive values were 99% for e. coli and k. pneumoniae and 89% for the species producing inducible ampc beta-lactamase. in conclusion, the betalacta test was found to be easy to use and efficient for the prediction of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, particularly in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains.

TI  == susceptibility of gram-negative aerobic bacilli from intra-abdominal pathogens to antimicrobial agents collected in the united states during 2011.
AB  == objectives: during 2011, a total of 1442 gram-negative pathogens from intra-abdominal infections were collected as part of the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart) from 19 hospital sites within the united  states. susceptibility to ertapenem and comparators and molecular analysis of ertapenem resistant isolates was performed. methods: extended-spectrum beta-lactamase esbl (esbl) isolates were determined using the clinical and laboratory standards institute's recommended phenotypic test. isolates were identified to the species level, and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using custom microscan dehydrated broth microdilution panels esbls and carbapenemases were characterized using the check-points microarray. strain typing of klebsiella pneumoniae was performed by rep-pcr on the diversilab system. results: the majority of isolates were escherichia coli (36%), k. pneumoniae (18.6%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%) and enterobacter cloacae (8.4%). incidence of esbl-positive isolates was 12.7%, 9.7%, 3.6% and 3.1% for k. pneumoniae, e. coli, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella oxytoca, respectively. against the majority of isolates and species tested, the most active antibiotics  were amikacin, ertapenem, and imipenem, with the carbapenems being the most active in vitro, including against esbl-positive isolates of e. coli. all other antibiotics exhibited diminished activity. against k. pneumoniae, the carbapenems were notably less active against esbl-positive isolates though their activity against this sub-population was still the highest of all antibiotics tested; however, 41.1% (14 of 34) of the phenotypically esbl-positive k. pneumoniae co-produced a carbapenemase (kpc2 or kpc3), and >90% of the isolates producing only an esbl remained susceptible to ertapenem. conclusions: further monitoring of susceptibility of intra-abdominal isolates is warranted due to limited therapeutic options available to physicians.

TI  == first canadian outbreak of enterobacteriaceae-expressing klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase type 3.
AB  == background: organisms expressing klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (kpc) are found in several regions worldwide but are rarely detected in canada. the first outbreak of kpc-expressing strains of enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates in a university-affiliated hospital intensive care unit (icu) in canada is described.  methods: enterobacteriaceae isolates that were flagged by the vitek 2 (biomerieux, france) system as possible carbapenemase producers were subjected to the modified hodge test. modified hodge test-positive organisms were analyzed by  pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, tested for kpc and other beta-lactamase genes by polymerase chain reaction analysis and underwent subsequent nucleic acid sequencing. antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were determined by vitek 2 and  etest (biomerieux, france). a chart review was conducted to establish epidemiological links. results: during the study period, 10 unique enterobacteriaceae isolates expressing kpc were detected from nine icu patients.  five patients had infections (three pneumonias, one surgical site infection, one  urinary tract infection). isolates included escherichia coli (5), klebsiella oxytoca (2), serratia marcescens (2) and citrobacter freundii (1). polymerase chain reaction analysis and sequencing confirmed the presence of kpc-3 in all isolates; four also carried tem, two ctx-m and one cmy-2. the imipenem minimum inhibitory concentrations as determined by etest ranged from 0.75 mug/ml to >/=32 mug/ml. pulsed field gel electrophoresis clonal patterns and patient location in  the icu revealed presumptive horizontal transmission events. conclusions: in the  present study, enterobacteriaceae isolates with kpc are emerging and can result in serious infections. the kpc gene can spread via plasmids to different genera of the enterobacteriaceae family. the dissemination of kpc in enterobacteriaceae  and the consequences for treatment and infection control measures warrant a high  degree of vigilance among clinicians and microbiologists.

TI  == a newly isolated bacillus licheniformis strain thermophilically produces 2,3-butanediol, a platform and fuel bio-chemical.
AB  == background: 2,3-butanediol (2,3-bd), a platform and fuel bio-chemical, can be efficiently produced by klebsiella pneumonia, k. oxytoca, and serratia marcescens. however, these strains are opportunistic pathogens and not favorable  for industrial application. although some generally regarded as safe (gras) microorganisms have been isolated in recent years, there is still a demand for safe 2,3-bd producing strains with high productivity and yield under thermophilic fermentation. results: bacillus licheniformis strain 10-1-a was newly isolated for 2,3-bd production. the optimum temperature and medium ph were 50 degrees c and ph 7.0 for 2,3-bd production by strain 10-1-a. the medium composition was optimized through plackett-burman design and response surface methodology techniques. with a two-stage agitation speed control strategy, 115.7 g/l of 2,3-bd was obtained from glucose by fed-batch fermentation in a 5-l bioreactor with a high productivity (2.4 g/l.h) and yield (94% of its theoretical value). the 2,3-bd produced by strain 10-1-a comprises (2r,3r)-2,3-bd and meso-2,3-bd with a ratio of nearly 1:1. the bdh and gdh genes encoding meso-2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase (meso-bdh) and glycerol dehydrogenase (gdh) of strain 10-1-a were expressed in escherichia coli and the proteins were purified. meso-2,3-bd and (2r,3r)-2,3-bd were transformed from racemic acetoin by meso-bdh and gdh with nadh, respectively. conclusions: compared with the reported gras 2,3-bd producers, b. licheniformis 10-1-a could thermophilically produce 2,3-bd with a high concentration, productivity and yield. thus, the newly isolated gras strain  10-1-a might be a promising strain for industrial production of 2,3-bd. two key enzymes for meso-2,3-bd and (2r,3r)-2,3-bd production were purified and further studied, and this might be helpful to understand the mechanism for 2,3-bd stereoisomers forming in b. licheniformis.

AB  == the in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 canadian hospitals from january 2010 to december 2012. in total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method (document m07-a9, 2012), with mics interpreted by using clsi breakpoints (document m100-s23, 2013). ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (mic90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, c. freundii, and h. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to clsi mic interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (p. mirabilis) to 54.0% (s. marcescens). all isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates (mic90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity  against staphylococci or streptococci. all isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.03 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and streptococcus agalactiae (mic90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. we conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to  third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)- and ampc-producing e. coli and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.

TI  == anatomy of secretin binding to the dickeya dadantii type ii secretion system pilotin.
AB  == the secretins are a family of large multimeric channels in the outer membrane of  gram-negative bacteria that are involved in protein export. in dickeya dadantii and many other pathogenic bacteria, the lipoprotein pilotin targets the secretin  subunits to the outer membrane, allowing a functional type ii secretion system to be assembled. here, the crystal structure of the c-terminal peptide of the secretin subunit bound to its cognate pilotin is reported. in solution, this c-terminal region of the secretin is nonstructured. the secretin peptide folds on binding to the pilotin to form just under four turns of alpha-helix which bind tightly up against the first helix of the pilotin so that the hydrophobic residues of the secretin helix can bind to the hydrophobic surface of the pilotin. the secretin helix binds parallel to the first part of the fourth helix  of the pilotin. an n-capping aspartate encourages helix formation and binding by  interacting favourably with the helix dipole of the helical secretin peptide. the structure of the secretin-pilotin complex of the phytopathogenic d. dadantii described here is a paradigm for this interaction in the outs-puls family of pilotins, which is essential for the correct assembly of the type ii secretion system of several potent human adversaries, including enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli and klebsiella oxytoca.

TI  == [dissemination of blaimp-8 among enterobacteriaceae isolates from a buenos aires  hospital].
AB  == from august 2008 to december 2011, six metallo-beta-lactamase-producing isolates, four enterobacter cloacae, one klebsiella oxytoca and one citrobacter freundii, were detected at hospital interzonal general de agudos "evita" in lanus. all six  isolates showed multiresistant profiles and the presence of the blaimp-8 gene. five isolates also expressed per-2 extended spectrum beta-lactamase. the blaimp-8 gene was found as the first cassette in a class 1 integron. however, the 3 conserved sequence could not be detected in three isolates. in all cases, blaimp-8 was transferred by conjugation to azide-resistant escherichia coli j53.  pfge analysis revealed that the four e. cloacae isolates were not genetically related. these are the first metallo-beta-lactamases detected in this institution and our results suggest a possible intra- and inter-species horizontal dissemination of blaimp-8.

TI  == amoxicillin-clavulanic acid resistance in fecal enterobacteriaceae from patients  with cystic fibrosis and healthy siblings.
AB  == background: the present study set out to detect and identify amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (amc)-resistant enterobacteriaceae in fecal samples of two patients with cystic fibrosis (cf) and their respective siblings. methods: fecal enterobacteriaceae were enumerated onto emb agar containing amoxicillin (amx). a total of 173 cf isolates and 41 sibling isolates were grouped into seven matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) clusters and identified through 16s rrna and rpob sequence analysis. results: the fecal microbiota of patients with cf revealed a higher prevalence of amx resistant enterobacteriaceae compared to that of their healthy  siblings. whereas all selected isolates of healthy siblings were assigned to escherichia coli, isolates of patients with cf belonged to klebsiella oxytoca (58.4%), e. coli (28.3%), klebsiella variicola (7.5%) or citrobacter sp. (5.8%).  all tested cf isolates showed a high resistance rate to amx, and a lower level of resistance to the combination with clavulanic acid. in contrast, all tested sibling isolates were susceptible for both amx and amc. conclusion: the higher abundance of amx resistance in the investigated patients with cf suggests that frequent amc administration may be one of the major contributing factors in the proliferation of enterobacteriaceae and the development of resistant strains in the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == adverse effects of members of the enterobacteriaceae family on boar sperm quality.
AB  == semen samples collected in 2012 from 1785 boars belonging to five different breeds were recruited from the quality control laboratory of magapor sl, spain. these samples came from 43 boar studs and resulted from diluting the ejaculates in commercial semen extenders. evaluation of the semen sample characteristics (color, smell, ph, osmolality, concentration, motility of sperm cells, agglutination, acrosome integrity, short hypoosmotic swelling test, and abnormal  forms) revealed that they met the international standards. the samples were also  tested for the presence of aerobic bacterial contamination. in the present study, 14.73% (n = 263) of the semen samples were contaminated above 3 x 10(2) colony-forming units/ml with at least one type of bacteria. the enterobacteriaceae family was by far the major contaminant, being present in 40.68% of the contaminated samples (n = 107). bacterial strains of the enterobacteriaceae family isolated from boar semen samples were in order of incidence (percentage of the contaminated samples): serratia marcescens (12.55%), klebsiella oxytoca (11.79%), providencia stuartii (9.12%), morganella morganii (3.80%), proteus mirabilis (1.90%), and escherichia coli (1.52%). we have seen that the presence in semen samples of s. marcescens, k. oxytoca, m. morganii, or  p. mirabilis, but not p. stuartii or e. coli, was negatively associated with sperm motility (p < 0.05). the mean sperm concentration (p < 0.05), the mean percentage of spermatozoa with curled tails after the short hypoosmotic swelling  test (p < 0.01), and the incidence of morphologically normal acrosomes (p < 0.05) were also lower in semen samples infected with m. morganii compared with uninfected ones. moreover, p. mirabilis was negatively associated with the presence of abnormal forms. thus, on the basis of the pathological effects that some of these strains may have on boar sperm quality, bacterial contamination should always be examined in semen samples prepared for artificial insemination.

TI  == prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacteria from milkmen and cows with clinical mastitis in and around kampala, uganda.
AB  == background: identification of pathogens associated with bovine mastitis is helpful in treatment and management decisions. however, such data from sub-saharan africa is scarce. here we describe the distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacteria from cows with clinical mastitis in kampala,  uganda. due to high concern of zoonotic infections, isolates from milkmen are also described. methodology/principal findings: ninety seven milk samples from cows with clinical mastitis and 31 nasal swabs from milkmen were collected (one sample per cow/human). fifty eight (60%) gram-positive isolates namely staphylococci (21), enterococci (16), streptococci (13), lactococci (5), micrococci (2) and arcanobacteria (1) were detected in cows; only one grew staphylococcus aureus. furthermore, 24 (25%) coliforms namely escherichia coli (12), klebsiella oxytoca (5), proteus vulgaris (2), serratia (2), citrobacter (1), cedecea (1) and leclercia (1) were identified. from humans, 24 gram-positive bacteria grew, of which 11 were staphylococci (35%) including four staphylococcus aureus. upon susceptibility testing, methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) were prevalent; 57%, 12/21 in cows and 64%, 7/11 in humans.  however, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was not detected. furthermore, methicillin and vancomycin resistant cons were detected in cows (staphylococcus hominis, staphylococcus lugdunensis) and humans (staphylococcus scuiri). also, vancomycin and daptomycin resistant enterococci (enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, respectively) were detected in cows. coliforms were less resistant with three pan-susceptible isolates. however, multidrug resistant klebsiella, proteus, serratia, cedecea, and citrobacter were detected.  lastly, similar species grew from human and bovine samples but on genotyping, the isolates were found to be different. interestingly, human and bovine staphylococcus aureus were genetically similar (spa-cc435, spa-type t645 corresponding to st121) but with different susceptibility patterns. conclusions/significance: cons, enterococci, streptococci, and escherichia coli are the predominant pathogens associated with clinical bovine-mastitis in kampala, uganda. multidrug resistant bacteria are also prevalent. while similar species occurred in humans and cows, transmission was not detected.

TI  == high prevalence of vim-4 and ndm-1 metallo-beta-lactamase among carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to identify the mechanisms leading to carbapenem resistance among multidrug-resistant enterobacteriaceae isolates recovered from hospitalized patients with nosocomial infections in mubarak al kabeer hospital, kuwait. fourteen carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae isolates were obtained from inpatients in different wards and intensive care units between april 2009 and february 2011. antibiotic susceptibilities were determined using the e-test method. genes encoding beta-lactamases were characterized by specific pcr amplification, sequencing and conjugation assays. all isolates were identified as metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl) producers using phenotypic and molecular methods. eleven of the 14 isolates produced vim-4 (six klebsiella pneumoniae, three escherichia coli, one enterobacter cloacae and one klebsiella oxytoca). three k.  pneumoniae isolates produced the mbl ndm-1 and co-produced the plasmid-encoded ampc cmy-4. the vim-4-producing isolates co-produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases including ctx-m-15 and some shv derivatives. the vim-4 gene was not transferable by conjugation studies of six selected strains. we demonstrated  here the emergence of vim-4- and ndm-1-producing isolates in the largest teaching hospital in kuwait.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of inpatient urinary tract isolates of gram-negative bacilli in the united states: results from the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart) program: 2009-2011.
AB  == background: the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends is an ongoing global surveillance program that has monitored the susceptibilities of gram-negative bacilli from inpatient urinary tract infections (utis) since late 2009. objective: this analysis reports on the in vitro susceptibility of 2,135 isolates collected by 24 us sites from hospitalized patients with utis between 2009 and 2011. methods: minimum inhibitory concentrations and susceptibility were determined according to the guidelines of the clinical and laboratory standards institute. results: of the isolates collected, 88.6% (1,892) were enterobacteriaceae, which included 48.9% (n = 1,045) escherichia coli, 14.5% (n = 310) klebsiella pneumoniae, 6.4% (n = 136) proteus mirabilis, 2.5% (n = 54) klebsiella oxytoca, and 16.3% (n = 347) other enterobacteriaceae species. overall, 6.8% of e coli, 10.3% of k pneumoniae, 3.7% of p mirabilis, and 11.1% of k oxytoca isolates were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. of the enterobacteriaceae isolates, 67.5% were community associated and 26.9% were hospital associated (5.7% had no demographics). highest overall rates of activity for the study period were seen with amikacin, ertapenem, and imipenem. the least  active antimicrobials tested were ampicillin-sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin. conclusions: ertapenem, imipenem, and amikacin were the most active study drugs against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains, although  the activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing k pneumoniae did  not exceed 69% throughout the study period. the results of the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends surveillance study document the rates  of antimicrobial resistance in uti pathogens in the united states, which can assist health care practitioners in selecting the appropriate treatment for utis.

TI  == distribution of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, ampc beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases among enterobacteriaceae isolates causing intra-abdominal infections in the asia-pacific region: results of the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart).
AB  == the increasing trend of beta-lactam resistance among enterobacteriaceae is a worldwide threat. enterobacteriaceae isolates causing intra-abdominal infections  (iai) from the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart) collected in 2008 and 2009 from the asia-pacific region were investigated. detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), ampc beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases was performed by multiplex pcr. a total of 699 enterobacteriaceae  isolates with positive genotypic results, included escherichia coli (n = 443), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 187), enterobacter cloacae (n = 45), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 9), citrobacter freundii (n = 5), proteus mirabilis (n = 3), enterobacter aerogenes (n = 2), morganella morganii (n = 2), and one each of enterobacter asburiae, proteus vulgaris, and providencia rettgeri were analyzed.  nearly 20% of these beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates were from community-associated iai. ctx-m (588 isolates, including 428 [72.8%] with ctx-m-15) was the most common esbl, followed by shv (n = 59) and tem (n = 4). cmy (n = 110, including 102 [92.7%] with cmy-2) was the most common ampc beta-lactamase, followed by dha (n = 46) and act/mir (n = 40). ndm (n = 65, including 62 [95.4%] with ndm-1) was the most common carbapenemase, followed by imp (n = 7) and oxa (n = 7). isolates from hospital-associated iai had more complicated beta-lactamase combinations than isolates from the community. carbapenemases were all exclusively detected in enterobacteriaceae isolates from  india, except that imp beta-lactamases were also detected in philippines and australia. ctx-m beta-lactamases were the predominant esbls produced by enterobacteriaceae causing iai in the asia-pacific region. emergence of ctx-m-15-, cmy-2-, and ndm-1-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates is of major concern and highlights the need for further surveillance in this area.

TI  == the targeting, docking and anti-proteolysis functions of the secretin chaperone puls.
AB  == the klebsiella oxytoca lipoprotein puls might function as either or both a pilot  and a docking factor in the outer membrane targeting and assembly of the type ii  secretion system secretin puld. in the piloting model, puls binds to puld monomers and targets them to the outer membrane via the lipoprotein sorting pathway components lola and lolb. in this model, puls also protects the puld monomers from proteolysis during transit through the periplasm. in the docking model, puls is targeted alone to the outer membrane, where it acts as a receptor  for puld monomers, allowing them to accumulate and assemble specifically in this  membrane. puls was shown to dissociate from and/or re-associate freely with puld  multimers in zwitterionic detergent, making it difficult to determine whether puls remains associated with puld dodecamers in the outer membrane by co-purification. however, puld protomers in the dodecamer were shown to be stable in the absence of puls, indicating that puls is only required to protect the protease-susceptible monomer. degp was identified as one of the proteases that could contribute to puld degradation in the absence of puls. studies on the in vitro assembly and targeting of puld into escherichia coli membrane vesicles demonstrated its strong preference to insert into the inner membrane, as is the case in vivo in the absence of puls. however, puld could be targeted to outer membrane fragments in vitro if they were preloaded with puls, indicating the technical feasibility of the docking model. we conclude that both modes of action might contribute to efficient outer membrane targeting of puld in vivo, although  the piloting function is likely to predominate.

AB  == objective: to investigate the risk factors for recurrent urinary tract infections (utis) in infants with vesicoureteral reflux (vur) and whether bacterial pathogen affected breakthrough uti or not. methods: we compared children with infantile vur with recurrent uti (33 males, 11 females, mean age 3.2 months) and without recurrent uti (40 males, 7 females, mean age 4.8 months). the following were compared between the 2 groups: sex, timing of uti episode, bacterial growth on urine culture, degree and bilaterality of the reflux, hydronephrosis, renal scar, and delayed ureteral excretion of refluxed contrast on voiding cystourethrogram (vcug). results: univariate cox survival-time regression showed that younger age  at first uti, a non-escherichia coli strain, bilateral and vur, high-grade vur, and hydronephrosis on initial ultrasonography (usg) significantly increased the risks of recurrent uti (p <.05 each). in multivariate analysis, timing of the uti episode (p = .015), a non-e. coli strain (p = .003), high grade (p = .012), and bilateral vur (p = .002) were independently associated with increased risk of recurrent uti. non-e. coli strains were identified in 60% and 33% of infants with and without recurrent uti, respectively. conclusion: during the first year of life, the earlier the first uti then the higher the chance is for recurrent utis. higher grades of reflux, bilateral vur, and the first infection by a non-e. coli  strain all significantly increase the risk of recurrent utis.

TI  == differential distribution of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes in clinical enterobacteria with unusual phenotypes of quinolone susceptibility from  argentina.
AB  == we studied a collection of 105 clinical enterobacteria with unusual phenotypes of quinolone susceptibility to analyze the occurrence of plasmid-mediated quinolone  resistance (pmqr) and oqx genes and their implications for quinolone susceptibility. the oqxa and oqxb genes were found in 31/34 (91%) klebsiella pneumoniae and 1/3 klebsiella oxytoca isolates. however, the oqxa- and oqxb-harboring isolates lacking other known quinolone resistance determinants showed wide ranges of susceptibility to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin. sixty of the 105 isolates (57%) harbored at least one pmqr gene [qnrb19, qnrb10, qnrb2, qnrb1, qnrs1, or aac(6')-ib-cr)], belong to 8 enterobacterial species, and were disseminated throughout the country, and most of them were categorized as susceptible by the current clinical quinolone susceptibility breakpoints. we developed a disk diffusion-based method to improve the phenotypic detection of aac(6')-ib-cr. the most common pmqr genes in our collection [qnrb19, qnrb10, and  aac(6')-ib-cr] were differentially distributed among enterobacterial species, and two different epidemiological settings were evident. first, the species associated with community-acquired infections (salmonella spp. and escherichia coli) mainly harbored qnrb19 (a unique pmqr gene) located in small cole1-type plasmids that might constitute its natural reservoirs. qnrb19 was not associated  with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase phenotype. second, the species associated with hospital-acquired infections (enterobacter spp., klebsiella spp., and serratia marcescens) mainly harbored qnrb10 in iscr1-containing class 1 integrons that may also have aac(6')-ib-cr as a cassette within the variable region. these two pmqr genes were strongly associated with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase phenotype. therefore, this differential distribution of pmqr genes is strongly influenced by their linkage or lack of linkage to integrons.

AB  == there has been increasing concern on the emergence of multidrug-resistant foodborne pathogens from foods of animal origin, including poultry. the current study aimed to evaluate antibiotic-resistant enterobacteriaceae from raw retail chicken/turkey parts (thigh, wings, breast, and ground) and beef meat (ground and chunks) in middle tennessee. resistance of the collected enterobacteriaceae to a  panel of antibiotics was determined by the kirby-bauer disk diffusion test. retail meats were also assayed for the presence of salmonella spp. and escherichia coli o157:h7. two hundred thirty-seven samples representing 95.2% of  the total of 249 samples tested were positive for enterobacteriaceae. the level of contamination with enterobacteriaceae in raw meats ranged from 3.26 log10 cfu/g to 4.94 log10 cfu/g with significant differences in counts among meat types (p < 0.05). contamination was significantly greater (p < 0.05) in ground beef, beef chucks, ground chicken, chicken breast, and turkey wings (4.92, 4.58, 4.94,  4.75, 4.13 log10 cfu/g, respectively) than ground turkey and chicken wings (3.26  and 3.26 log10 cfu/g, respectively). klebsiella oxytoca, serratia spp., e. coli,  and haffnia alvei were most prevalent contaminants at 27.4, 14.3, 12.1, and 11.4%, respectively. resistance of the enterobacteriaceae to antimicrobials was most frequent with erythromycin, penicillin, and ampicillin at 100, 89, and 65.8%, respectively. few (2.7%) of the enterobacteriaceae were resistant to chloramphenicol. salmonella spp., e. coli o157:h7, morganella morganii, yersinia  enterocolitica, and vibrio parahemolyticus exhibited multiple drug resistance. this investigation demonstrates that raw poultry and beef are potential reservoirs of antibiotic-resistant enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == microbial uropathogens and their antibiotic resistance profile from hospitalized  patients in central alabama.
AB  == urinary tract infections remain a common problem in inpatient care. they are highly challenging to provide effective initial therapy without sensitivity data. the purpose of this study was to survey the uropathogens and their sensitivity profile at a hospital in central alabama and to guide experiential antibiotic selection. this was the first reported study on bacterial uropathogens and their  antibiotic resistance profile at this central alabama hospital. the survey period was between july 2009 and june 2010, a total of 473 urine cultures were reviewed  and susceptibility testing was determined using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) microdilution method. the results indicated that escherichia coli (45.5%) was the most common organism, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (18.2%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.1%), proteus mirabilis (7.8%), enterobacter cloacae (4.2%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (3.0%),  klebsiella oxytoca and citrobacter freundii (1.5%), morganella morganii (1.3%), and the other species (7.0%). for the 215 e. coli isolates, imipenem and cephalosporins (except for cefazolin) had the highest sensitivity (99-100%, p < 0.05). in contrast, ampicillin had the highest resistance (57%, p < 0.05) as compared to other antibiotics (about 30%) including ampicillin/ sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. the major finding of this study was that ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole had comparable sensitivity patterns for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae, the most common uropathogens at this central alabama hospital. additionally, this study found that e. coli had a resistant rate of 31% to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin compared to the resistance rate of 28.4% and 15.8% in earlier reports (lee et al. 2010; rattanaumpawan et al. 2010), likely indicating the continuing evolution of resistance due to antibiotic exposure. it is imperative to monitor the resistance of p. aeruginosa considering their high resistance to imipenem found in this study.

TI  == multi-functional analysis of klebsiella pneumoniae fimbrial types in adherence and biofilm formation.
AB  == klebsiella pneumoniae is an opportunistic pathogen frequently associated with nosocomially acquired infections. host cell adherence and biofilm formation of k. pneumoniae isolates is mediated by type 1 (t1p) and type 3 (mr/k) pili whose major fimbrial subunits are encoded by the fima and mrka genes, respectively. the e. coli common pilus (ecp) is an adhesive structure produced by all e. coli pathogroups and a homolog of the ecpabcde operon is present in the k. pneumoniae  genome. in this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of these three fimbrial genes among a collection of 69 clinical and environmental k. pneumoniae  strains and to establish a correlation with fimbrial production during cell adherence and biofilm formation. the pcr-based survey demonstrated that 96% of the k. pneumoniae strains contained ecpa and 94% of these strains produced ecp during adhesion to cultured epithelial cells. eighty percent of the strains forming biofilms on glass produced ecp, suggesting that ecp is required, at least in vitro, for expression of these phenotypes. the fim operon was found in 100% of the strains and t1p was detected in 96% of these strains. while all the strains examined contained mrka, only 57% of them produced mr/k fimbriae, alone or together with ecp. in summary, this study highlights the ability of k. pneumoniae strains to produce ecp, which may represent a new important adhesive structure of this organism. further, it defines the multi-fimbrial nature of the interaction of this nosocomial pathogen with host epithelial cells and inert surfaces.

TI  == microbiological investigation of raphanus sativus l. grown hydroponically in nutrient solutions contaminated with spoilage and pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == the survival of eight undesired (spoilage/pathogenic) food related bacteria (citrobacter freundii pss60, enterobacter spp. pss11, escherichia coli pss2, klebsiella oxytoca pss82, serratia grimesii pss72, pseudomonas putida pss21, stenotrophomonas maltophilia pss52 and listeria monocytogenes atcc 19114(t)) was  investigated in mineral nutrient solution (mns) during the crop cycle of radishes (raphanus sativus l.) cultivated in hydroponics in a greenhouse. mnss were microbiologically analyzed weekly by plate count. the evolution of the pure cultures was also evaluated in sterile mns in test tubes. the inoculated trials contained an initial total mesophilic count (tmc) ranging between 6.69 and 7.78log cfu/ml, while non-sterile and sterile control trials showed levels of 4.39 and 0.97log cfu/ml, respectively. in general, all inoculated trials showed similar levels of tmc in mns during the experimentation, even though the levels of the inoculated bacteria decreased. the presence of the inoculums was ascertained by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis applied on the  isolates collected at 7-day intervals. at harvest, mnss were also analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). the last analysis, except p. putida pss21 in the corresponding trial, did not detect the other bacteria, but confirmed that pseudomonads were present in un-inoculated mnss. despite the high  counts detected (6.44 and 7.24cfu/g), only c. freundii pss60, enterobacter spp. pss11 and k. oxytoca pss82 were detected in radishes in a living form, suggesting their internalization.

TI  == intestinal enterobacteriaceae and escherichia coli populations in japanese adults demonstrated by the reverse transcription-quantitative pcr and the clone library  analyses.
AB  == a primer set specific for escherichia coli/shigella 16s rrna was developed and used for rt-qpcr analysis of fecal samples from 35 healthy adult volunteers in combination with the previously reported primer set specific for enterobacteriaceae. enterobacteriaceae and e. coli were present in the 29 out of  35 volunteers tested as intestinal commensals at the average population levels of 10(7.1+/-0.9) and 10(6.8+/-0.7)cellsg(-1) of stools (mean+/-standard deviation),  respectively. among the 7 volunteers, the significant deviation between the count of enterobacteriaceae and that of e. coli was observed, suggesting non-e. coli/shigella species were predominant in their enterobacteriaceae populations. the clone library analysis revealed that the non-e. coli/shigella populations included citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae/variicola and morganella morganii. these data suggested that the rt-qpcr method with the primer sets specific to both enterobacteriaceae and e. coli/shigella enabled the accurate enumeration of  intestinal e. coli populations and the other enterobacteriaceae species populations.

TI  == fecal carriage and intrafamilial spread of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae following colonization at the neonatal icu.
AB  == objective: fecal carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae may contribute to the spread of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae into the community. the objective of  this study was to assess the duration of fecal carriage after discharge and the occurrence of intrafamilial transmission. design: case series. setting: quaternary care children's hospital. patients: patients colonized with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae at the neonatal icu and the respective household members. interventions: screening for intestinal extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae colonization was done at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months after discharge. genetic relatedness of isolated extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae strains was determined using automated rep-pcr. results: twenty-five neonates (case-patients) colonized with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae (one extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-escherichia coli; six extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-klebsiella pneumoniae; 11 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-klebsiella oxytoca; and seven extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-serratia marcescens) were included. duration of fecal carriage was longer (up to 1 yr) in case-patients colonized with klebsiella species than in case-patients colonized with serratia marcescens (<4 months). during follow-up, strains and species of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae different from the primary strain were found in four and three case-patients, respectively. in nine of 49 (18.4%) included household members, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae were found during the follow-up period. in two of nine colonized household members, the isolated extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae was identical to the primary strains of the respective case-patients. conclusions: after intestinal colonization with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae at the neonatal icu, infants potentially remain carriers during the first year after discharge. intrafamilial spread has been proven.

TI  == susceptibility of important gram-negative pathogens to tigecycline and other antibiotics in latin america between 2004 and 2010.
AB  == background: the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (t.e.s.t.) is a global surveillance study of antimicrobial susceptibility. this study reports data from gram-negative isolates collected from centers in latin america between  2004 and 2010. methods: consecutive bacterial isolates were tested at each center using broth microdilution methodology as described by the clinical laboratory standards institute (clsi). susceptibility was determined using the clsi interpretive criteria. for tigecycline the us federal drug administration (fda) criteria were used. results: a total of 16 232 isolates were analyzed. susceptibility to imipenem, meropenem, and tigecycline was >95% against both non-extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) and esbl producing escherichia coli.  susceptibility to amikacin was also >95% for non-esbl e. coli. 24.3% of e. coli were esbl producers, ranging from 11.2% (58/519) in colombia to 40.3% (31/77) in  honduras. greater than 90% of non-esbl klebsiella pneumoniae were susceptible to  tigecycline, carbapenems and amikacin. 35.3% of k. pneumoniae were esbl producers, ranging from 17.2% (36/209) in venezuela to 73.3% (55/75) in honduras, with only imipenem and tigecycline maintaining >90% susceptibility. greater than  90% of klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter spp., and serratia marcescens were susceptible to amikacin, carbapenems and tigecycline. the highest rates of susceptibility against acinetobacter baumannii were seen for minocycline (89.4%)  and imipenem (62.5%), while 95.8% of the a. baumannii isolates displayed an mic</=2 mug/ml for tigecycline. conclusions: in this study carbapenems and tigecycline remain active against enterobacteriaceae and a. baumannii; however, there is cause for concern with carbapenem non-susceptible isolates reported in all countries included in this study.

AB  == in this study, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates in children with malignancies hospitalised at a paediatric oncology department in the czech republic were investigated. from june 2009 to january 2010, a total of 50 esbl-producing faecal isolates of enterobacteriaceae were obtained from 28 patients. these isolates were characterised with regard to esbl enzymes, plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance  genes, multilocus sequence typing (mlst) and plasmids conferring resistance to cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. esbl-producing isolates included klebsiella  pneumoniae (n=36), escherichia coli (n=7), klebsiella oxytoca (n=3), enterobacter cloacae (n=2) and citrobacter freundii (n=2). klebsiella pneumoniae isolates belonged to 7 mlst types, including sequence types st280, st321, st323 and st416  as well as the novel types st626, st627 and st628. the multiresistant epidemic clone e. coli b2-o25b-st131 was detected in one patient. the gene bla(ctx-m-15) was found on large conjugative incfii(k) plasmids along with bla(tem-1), bla(oxa-1), qnrb1, aac(6')-ib-cr, stra, sul2, aac(3')-ii and tet(a) genes in most isolates. dissemination of incfii(k) plasmids among various enterobacteriaceae isolates was considered an important aspect of nosocomial colonisation in the wards by enterobacteriaceae species producing esbls. this is the first study documenting multiple antibiotic resistance elements, including qnr genes, in incfii(k) plasmids in various bacterial species isolated in a single hospital department. the results highlight the evolution of incfii(k) plasmids into new variants containing novel antibiotic resistance elements and their important role in spreading esbl-producing bacteria among hospitalised patients.

TI  == impact of ph on activity of trimethoprim, fosfomycin, amikacin, colistin and ertapenem in human urine.
AB  == objective: although major impairment of activity at lower ph values has been reported for fluoroquinolones, acidification is a widely recommended practice for the prophylaxis and treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (utis). until now, there is little evidence for the influence of ph on the activity on other antimicrobial classes in urine. methods: bacterial growth curves of staphylococcus aureus (atcc 29213), klebsiella oxytoca (atcc 700324), proteus mirabilis (atcc 14153), escherichia coli (atcc 25922) and enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212) were performed in mueller-hinton broth and in pooled human urine with a ph of between 5.0 and 8.0. bacterial killing of trimethoprim, fosfomycin,  amikacin, colistin and ertapenem against the five strains (where appropriate) was determined consecutively at concentrations equal to the mic. results: while no difference in the bacterial growth of e. coli, s. aureus, p. mirabilis and k. oxytoca was observed at different ph values, bacterial growth of e. faecalis was  significantly reduced at low ph. acidification to ph 5 impaired the antimicrobial activity of all investigated antibiotics, i.e. the net effect of bacterial growth and killing resulted in increased colony-forming units/ml at the end of the experiment. conclusion: the present in vitro findings indicate that acidification of urine during the treatment of utis should be carefully considered. while growth curves of one strain supports the concept of therapeutic or prophylactic acidification during utis, the most common pathogen, e. coli, was not affected by low ph. independent of the investigated strain or antibiotic, ph values below 6 lead to a reduction of antimicrobial activity.

TI  == artemisia capillaris extracts as a green factory for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles with antibacterial activities.
AB  == we report a green synthesis of silver nanoparticles that uses extracts from the aerial part of artemisia capillaris. both water and 70% ethanol extracts successfully generated silver nanoparticles. the formation of silver nanoparticles was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance bands, fourier transform-infrared spectra, high resolution-transmission electron and atomic force microscopic images. various shapes of silver nanoparticles were generated with an average diameter of 29.71 nm with water extract and 29.62 nm with 70% ethanol extract. an improvement in antibacterial activity (mic 8.35-16.7 microg/ml) was observed against a total of twenty different strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. a remarkable enhancement (approximately 12-fold) was observed against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, and klebsiella areogenes when compared  with the extract alone. silver nanoparticles produced by the 70% ethanol extract  showed slightly higher antibacterial activity than those generated with the water extract. the correlation between total flavonoid content of each extract and the  antibacterial activity did not exert any significant relationships. this report suggests that plant extracts have the potential to be used as powerful reducing agents for the production of biocompatible silver nanoparticles possessing enhanced antibacterial activities.

TI  == heterologous assembly of type iv pili by a type ii secretion system reveals the role of minor pilins in assembly initiation.
AB  == in gram-negative bacteria, type iv pilus assembly (t4ps) and type ii secretion (t2ss) systems polymerize inner membrane proteins called major pilins or pseudopilins respectively, into thin filaments. four minor pilins are required in both systems for efficient fibre assembly. escherichia coli k-12 has a set of t4ps assembly genes that are silent under standard growth conditions. we studied  the heterologous assembly of the e. coli type iv pilin ppdd by the klebsiella oxytoca t2ss called the pul system. ppdd pilus assembly in this context depended  on the expression of the k. oxytoca minor pseudopilin genes pulhijk or of the e.  coli minor pilin genes ppdab-ygdb-ppdc. the e. coli minor pilins restored assembly of the major pseudopilin pulg in a pulhijk mutant, but not the secretion of the t2ss substrate pullulanase. thus, minor pilins and minor pseudopilins are  functionally interchangeable in initiating major pilin assembly, further extending the fundamental similarities between the two systems. the data suggest  that, in both systems, minor pilins activate the assembly machinery through a common self-assembly mechanism. when produced together, pulg and ppdd assembled into distinct homopolymers, establishing major pilins as key determinants of pilus elongation and structure.

TI  == prime time for minor subunits of the type ii secretion and type iv pilus systems.
AB  == the type ii secretion system (t2ss) exports folded proteins from the periplasms of gram-negative bacteria. the type iv pilus system (t4ps) is a multifunctional machine used for adherence, motility and dna transfer in bacteria and archaea. partial sequence identity between the two systems suggests that they are related  and might function via a similar mechanism, the dynamic assembly and disassembly  of pseudopilus (t2ss) or pilus (t4ps) filaments. the major subunit in each system is thought to form the bulk of the (pseudo)pilus, while minor (low-abundance) subunits have proposed roles in assembly initiation, antagonism of disassembly, or modulation of (pseudo)pilus functional properties. in this issue, cisneros et  al. () extend their previous finding that pseudopilus assembly is primed by the minor pseudopilins, showing that the same proteins can initiate assembly of escherichia coli t4p. similarly, they show that the e. coli minor pilins prime the polymerization of t2s pseudopili, although unlike genuine pseudopili, the chimeric filaments did not support secretion. this work reinforces the notion of  a common assembly mechanism for the t2s and t4p systems.

AB  == background: enterobacteriaceae exerting a high level of extended-spectrum cephalosporin (esc) resistance have increased significantly in norway in the last decade. various mechanisms acting alone or in concert mediate variable levels of  esc resistance and pose great challenges in the implementation of screening strategies and treatment. this study was undertaken to document the prevalence of underlying mechanisms conferring resistance to escs in a nationwide collection of clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and klebsiella oxytoca, before the increase in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing strains. methods: consecutive e. coli (n = 2213), k. pneumoniae (n = 303), and k. oxytoca (n = 66) isolates from 23 norwegian diagnostic laboratories were collected and examined for reduced susceptibility to escs. isolates displaying minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of > 2 mg/l by etest to cefpodoxime and/or mics > 1 mg/l to any other escs were included (n = 54; 35 e. coli, 11 k. pneumoniae, and 8 k. oxytoca). isoelectric focusing for the detection of beta-lactamases, and polymerase chain reactions (pcrs) with subsequent sequencing for detection of esbls ctx-m, tem, and shv, plasmid-mediated ampc, oxa subtypes,  and alterations of porin genes ompc and ompf, and quantitative reverse transcriptase (rt)-pcr for investigation of enhanced expression of chromosomal ampc were performed. results: eight e. coli isolates (0.4%) were esbl producers and 20 (1.0%) were hyperproducers of the chromosomal ampc. three k. pneumoniae isolates (1.1%) were esbl producers, and all k. oxytoca isolates (n = 8; 13.6%) were oxy-hyperproducers. no definite mechanisms for reduced susceptibility to escs could be inferred for 7 e. coli (0.4%) and 8 k. pneumoniae (3.0%) isolates.  conclusions: this study identified chromosomal ampc-hyperproducing e. coli and oxy-hyperproducing k. oxytoca in addition to esbls in enterobacteriaceae as major mechanisms of resistance to esc, and documented their rates of prevalence for the first time in norway.

TI  == comparative study of nasal bacterial carriage in pediatric patients from two different geographical regions.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of bacterial carriage in the anterior nares of two different patient cohorts, aged 5-15 years. by use of a sensitive enrichment broth, gram-positive and -negative bacteria were cultured from the two cohorts of each 100 patients at the referral clinic in eritrea and at a german university hospital. in the german cohort, 27% of the patients were positive either for gram-negative (n=5) or -positive bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus (n=8; mrsa (n=2)), staphylococcus epidermidis (n=12), corynebacterium spp. (n=4), and streptococcus pyogenes (n=1). in comparison, the  eritrean cohort revealed 33% bacterial carriers in the anterior nares. among the  identified species were s. aureus (n=2), s. epidermidis (n=13), streptococcus haemolyticus (n=9), and gram-negative rods including klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca (n=5), enterobacter agglomerans (n=4), escherichia coli (n=2), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=1). noteworthy, none of the eritrean patients were  positive for mrsa. in both cohorts there was no co-occurrence of gram-positive and -negative bacteria in the anterior nares. however, we observed in two subjects of the eritrean cohort co-colonization with s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus. the occurrence of gram-negative bacteria was less significant by age in the german cohort, whereas in the eritrean cohort gram-negative bacteria were more frequently detected in carriers aged 5-9 years. continued surveillance  of s. aureus and gram-negative bacteria carriage deserves further attention and might help to determine future trends in the characteristics of nasal carriage, subsequent incidence of infections, and the potential effectiveness of targeted population based intervention.

AB  == a strain of lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei bmk2005 isolated from healthy infant faeces has shown a remarkable antibacterial activity against 32 bacterial pathogenic strains of human clinical isolates. among them, 13 strains belonging to species of escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant to cefotaxime (ctx) and ceftazidime (caz), and 4 strains of staphylococcus aureus were resistant to methicillin (mrsa). this antibacterial activity was attributed to a bacteriocin designated as paracaseicin a. it was heat-stable up to 120 degrees c for 5 min and active within the ph range of 2-5.  its activity was lost when treated with proteases, which reveals its proteinaceous nature. this bacteriocin was successfully purified only by two steps of reversed phase chromatography. its molecular mass, determined by mass spectrometry analysis, was 2,462.5 da. to our knowledge, the present study is the first report on characterization and purification of a bacteriocin, produced by a l. paracasei subsp. paracasei strain exhibiting an antibacterial activity against various multidrug-resistant species of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria,  which reveals its potential for use in prevention or treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant species especially in cases of antibiotics-associated diarrhea (aad).

TI  == pectin-rich biomass as feedstock for fuel ethanol production.
AB  == the usa has proposed that 30 % of liquid transportation fuel be produced from renewable resources by 2030 (perlack and stokes 2011). it will be impossible to reach this goal using corn kernel-based ethanol alone. pectin-rich biomass, an under-utilized waste product of the sugar and juice industry, can augment us ethanol supplies by capitalizing on this already established feedstock. currently, pectin-rich biomass is sold (at low value) as animal feed. this review focuses on the three most studied types of pectin-rich biomass: sugar beet pulp,  citrus waste and apple pomace. fermentations of these materials have been conducted with a variety of ethanologens, including yeasts and bacteria. escherichia coli can ferment a wide range of sugars including galacturonic acid,  the primary component of pectin. however, the mixed acid metabolism of e. coli can produce unwanted side products. saccharomyces cerevisiae cannot naturally ferment galacturonic acid nor pentose sugars but has a homoethanol pathway. erwinia chrysanthemi is capable of degrading many of the cell wall components of  pectin-rich materials, including pectin. klebsiella oxytoca can metabolize a diverse array of sugars including cellobiose, one degradation product of cellulose. however, both e. chrysanthemi and k. oxytoca produce side products during fermentation, similar to e. coli. using pectin-rich residues from industrial processes is beneficial because the material is already collected and  partially pretreated to facilitate enzymatic deconstruction of the plant cell walls. using biomass already produced for other purposes is an attractive practice because fewer greenhouse gases (ghg) will be anticipated from land-use changes.

TI  == etiologic profile and antimicrobial susceptibility of community-acquired urinary  tract infection in two cameroonian towns.
AB  == background: urinary tract infection (uti) represents one of the most common diseases encountered in community medical practice. in resource poor settings, treatment is usually empiric due to the high cost and long duration required for  reporting diagnosis by culture and antibiotic susceptibility testing. with the growing problem of drug resistance knowledge of antibiotic susceptibility pattern is pertinent for successful eradication of invading pathogens. our study, the first of its kind in cameroon, analyzed the distribution and antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria causing community-acquired urinary tract infection (cauti) in two towns (bamenda and buea) with a large number of young and middle aged persons, to provide data that could guide empiric treatment. findings: we cultured 235 urine specimens and analyzed the antibiotic susceptibility of isolates by the disc diffusion technique. uropathogens were recovered from 137 (58.3%), with prevalence rates in buea and bamenda being 65.9% and 54% respectively. predominant pathogens were escherichia coli (31.4%), klebsiella oxytoca (25.5%) and staphylococcus spp (24.1%). geographic variation in uropathogen distribution and antibiotic susceptibility was observed, and a significant difference in pathogen distribution with respect to gender. the 20-39 years age group had the highest prevalence of infection. all pathogens isolated were detected in this group. isolates exhibited low susceptibility to antibiotics tested. bamenda isolates generally exhibited lower susceptibility compared to those from buea. conclusion: regional variation in etiology of cauti and antibiotic susceptibility observed in our study emphasizes the need to establish  local and national antimicrobial resistance monitoring systems in cameroon to provide information for the development of cauti treatment guidelines.

AB  == background: red cell exchange/transfusion is frequently used in the management of patients with medical complications related to acute severe sickle cell disease (scd). however, peripheral venous access is often difficult without central venous catheters (cvcs) in adult patients with moderate or severe scd. aims: to review our experience with the use of the port-a-cath((r)) device in sixteen patients with scd undergoing exchange or simple transfusions. methods: among a cohort of 550 patients who frequently visited the inpatient service, sixteen scd  patients required the insertion of a port-a-cath((r)) device. these patients included 3 males and 13 females, aged 25-44 years [31.1 +/- 2.3; mean +/- sd]. a  total of 24 port-a-cath((r)) devices were implanted in these 16 patients during the study period. eleven patients had 1 device implanted, three patients had 2 devices, one patient had 3 devices, and one patient had 4 devices implanted. results: out of the 24 devices implanted, 17 required removal, due to either infection associated with sepsis and/or thrombosis. the organisms involved were candida spp. (3), c. parapsilosis (2), c. albicans (1), c. famata (1), c. lusitanice (1), staphylococcus spp. (6), and s. aureus (3), as well as the coagulase-negative staphylococcus (2), alpha hemolytic streptococcus (1), diphtheroid bacilli (2), pseudomonas aeruginosa (2), ps. spp. (3), escherichia coli (3), klebsiella oxytoca (1), klebsiella pneumoniae (1), klebsiella spp. (1), serratia liquefaciens (1), serratia fanticola (1), achromobacter spp. (2) chromobacterium violaceum (1), delftia acidovirans (1), stenotrophomonas maltophile (1), alcaligenes faecalis (1), and enterobacter cloacae (1). two episodes of documented thrombosis were observed. one case presented with right atrial thrombosis/svc syndrome and the other case presented with left upper arm thrombosis. two patients died with ports in situ, while five patients had ports in place at the time of this study. the median working life of the ports was 688.5 days (range: 39-3925). the rate of infective complications was 2.63 infections per 1000 catheter days, and the number of infections was significantly correlated with the number of ports [pearson's r=0.66; p<0.01]. discussion: our results suggest that patients with scd suffer infective complications associated  with the port-a-cath((r)), which often necessitate its removal. although these devices are extremely useful, their optimal beneficial potential is only realized if the patients receive proper care at special centers well-versed in the maintenance of such devices by experienced staff.

AB  == this study aimed to evaluate the routine setting performance of a guideline for phenotypic detection of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in enterobacteriaceae, recommending esbl confirmation with etest or combination disc for isolates with a positive esbl screen test (i.e. cefotaxime and/or ceftazidime mic >1 mg/l or an automated system esbl warning). twenty laboratories submitted 443 enterobacteriaceae with a positive esbl screen test and their confirmation test result (74%escherichia coli, 12%enterobacter cloacae, 8%klebsiella pneumoniae, 3%proteus mirabilis, 2%klebsiella oxytoca). presence of esbl genes was used as reference test. accuracy of local phenotypic esbl detection was 88%.  the positive predictive value (ppv) of local screen tests was 70%, and differed per method (vitek-2: 69%, phoenix: 68%, disc diffusion: 92%), and species (95%k.  pneumoniae-27%k. oxytoca). a low ppv (3%) was observed for isolates with automated system alarm but third-generation cephalosporin mics <2 mg/l. local esbl confirmation had a ppv and negative predictive value (npv) of 93% and 90%, respectively. compared with centrally performed confirmation tests, 7% of local tests were misinterpreted. combination disc was more specific than etest (91% versus 61%). confirmation tests were not reliable for p. mirabilis and k. oxytoca (ppv 33% and 38%, respectively, although npvs were 100%). in conclusion, performance of etests could be enhanced by education of technicians to improve their interpretation, by genotypic esbl confirmation of p. mirabilis and k. oxytoca isolates with positive phenotypic esbl confirmation, and by interpreting  isolates with a positive esbl alarm but an mic <2 mg/l for cefotaxime and ceftazidime as esbl-negative.

TI  == qnr, aac(6')-ib-cr and qepa genes in escherichia coli and klebsiella spp.: genetic environments and plasmid and chromosomal location.
AB  == objectives: to characterize the location and genetic environments of qnr, aac(6')-ib-cr and qepa genes related to quinolone resistance in 19 escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca strains. methods: genetic environments of the indicated genes were studied by cloning, pcr mapping and sequencing. the location of these genes was analysed by s1-pfge and pfge-i-ceui and hybridization with specific probes. associated antibiotic resistance mechanisms and molecular typing of strains were also investigated. results: the studied strains carried the aac(6')-ib-cr, qepa, qnrs1, qnrb6, qnrb4 and oqxab genes, with aac(6')-ib-cr being the most prevalent. e. coli strains belonged to sequence types (sts) st648, st131, st224 and st205, and k. pneumoniae strains to  st433, st341, st152, st15 and st431. different genetic environments of quinolone  resistance genes were observed, and some of them had not been previously detected and registered in genbank. the aac(6')-ib-cr gene was mainly located in class 1 integrons or associated with the tn1721 transposon in e. coli and associated with the aac(3)-ii gene in klebsiella. all these structures contained mechanisms of gene acquisition and/or dissemination, such as is26. the studied quinolone resistance genes were mostly detected in incf and incn plasmids in e. coli and in incr plasmids in klebsiella, but in some strains the chromosomal location of the  aac(6')-ib-cr gene was detected for the first time. the bla(ctx-m-15), bla(oxa-1), tet(a), aac(3)-ii and aph(3')-ia genes and class 1 integrons were found in most strains. conclusions: the aac(6')-ib-cr gene was detected for the first time in the chromosome, although a plasmidic location was the most frequently found, with differentiation of plasmids types in e. coli versus klebsiella.

TI  == introduction of oxa-48-producing enterobacteriaceae to israeli hospitals by medical tourism.
AB  == objectives: the carbapenemase oxa-48 has been reported from different mediterranean countries. it is mostly encoded on a single plasmid in various enterobacteriaceae species. we characterized the epidemiological and molecular features of oxa-48-producing enterobacteriaceae (ope) in israel. methods: epidemiological investigation was conducted by the national center for infection  control. genotyping was performed using multilocus sequence typing. the bla(oxa-48)-carrying plasmids were investigated using s1 endonuclease and restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp). conjugation efficiency of the bla(oxa-48)-carrying plasmids was studied in a filter mating experiment. results: since 2007, four ope-infected patients were identified, all non-israeli (two palestinian, one jordanian and one georgian). three had prior hospitalization; two in jordan and one in georgia. the bla(oxa-48) gene was detected in three escherichia coli strains belonging to different clonal complexes, one klebsiella  oxytoca and one klebsiella pneumoniae sequence type 101, as previously reported from tunisia and spain. in all isolates, the bla(oxa-48) gene was located inside  tn1999.2 and was carried on a 60 kb plasmid with an identical rflp pattern. the plasmid was able to conjugate from klebsiella spp. to e. coli, and had a conjugation efficiency up to ~10000 times higher than that of pkpqil. conclusions: ope, introduced mainly by medical tourism, are an emerging threat to patients from affected mediterranean countries. the bla(oxa-48)-carrying plasmid  demonstrated remarkable conjugation efficiency, which is probably important in the success of its dissemination.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparators against gram-negative pathogens  isolated from blood in europe (2004-2009).
AB  == here we report on the antimicrobial resistance amongst gram-negative isolates (excluding acinetobacter spp.) collected from blood culture sources at european study sites as part of the global tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (t.e.s.t.) from the study start in 2004 until august 2009. all isolates were collected and tested for minimum inhibitory concentrations using clinical and laboratory standards institute methodology. over the collection period, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production was recorded in 21.1% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 2.6% of klebsiella oxytoca and 11.3% of escherichia coli,  primarily in croatia, greece, hungary, italy, poland, romania and the slovak republic. esbl rates stabilised amongst k. pneumoniae over 2006-2009, but doubled amongst e. coli in 2008-2009. the patterns of antimicrobial resistance changed accordingly for both organisms. generally, greece had the highest antimicrobial resistance for k. pneumoniae, italy for e. coli, serratia marcescens and enterobacter spp., and croatia for pseudomonas aeruginosa. high resistance rates  amongst k. pneumoniae were also seen in croatia and italy. imipenem resistance amongst k. pneumoniae was reported exclusively in greece (13.8%); amongst other enterobacteriaceae, imipenem resistance was absent or low. similarly, meropenem resistance was low amongst the enterobacteriaceae except k. pneumoniae from greece (42.6%). across europe, the most active antimicrobial agents against the enterobacteriaceae were tigecycline, amikacin and the carbapenems, each with <10% resistance each year. against the other antimicrobials, significant increases in  non-susceptibility were reported for k. pneumoniae and e. coli, both important causative pathogens of bacteraemia.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative organisms from intraabdominal infections and evolution of isolates with extended spectrum beta-lactamases in the smart study in spain (2002-2010).
AB  == introduction: the smart (study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends) surveillance study records the antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative bacilli obtain from intraabdominal infections with special focus in isolates with extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls). material and methods: the antimicrobial susceptibility of 8,869 isolates was analyzed by microdilution during the smart study performed in spain from 2002 to 2010. isolates were recovered in 16 centres. results: escherichia coli was the most prevalent pathogen (60.9% from intraabdominal infections acquired in the community and 49.9% in those from nosocomial origin) followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (8.9% vs 9.2%). pseudomonas aeruginosa was more common in intraabdominal infections from nosocomial origin (5.6% community and 8.6% nosocomial). frequency of esbl-producing isolates was: e. coli, 8.7%; k. pneumoniae, 8.4%; klebsiella oxytoca, 1.4%; and proteus mirabilis, 1.6%. overall, esbl-producing isolates were more frequently isolated from elderly patients (6.8% >60 years). ertapenem and meropenem were the most active antimicrobials (susceptibility range with eucast criteria, 89.0-100%) when considering all enterobacteriaceae isolates and also against esbl producers (95.5-100%). susceptibility of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and piperacillin/tazobactam was lower, particularly among esbl-producing isolates. nevertheless, ertapenem maintained a good activity (susceptibility >95%) in esbl-producers that were resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, piperacillin/tazobactam or fluoroquinolones. conclusions: antimicrobial susceptibility data from the smart-spain study reinforce current therapeutic guidelines of intraabdominal infections that include ertapenem as the empirical choice for treatment. this is also supported by the high frequency of esbl-producers in our geographic area.

TI  == the age-related risk of co-existing meningitis in children with urinary tract infection.
AB  == objective: the primary aim of this study was to determine age-stratified rates of co-existing bacterial meningitis in children with urinary tract infection (uti).  the secondary aims of this study were to determine the causative pathogens of uti, and the clinical features and outcome of children with co-existing meningitis. methods: analysis of data collected over a nine-year period at a tertiary pediatric hospital in australia. study population: children below 16 years of age with culture-confirmed uti and a paired csf sample. results: a total of 748 episodes in 735 cases were included in the final analysis. the commonest pathogens causing uti were escherichia coli (67.4%), enterococcus faecalis (8.4%), klebsiella oxytoca (3.5%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (3.5%). only two (1.2%; 95% ci: 0.15-4.36%) of 163 neonates (between 0 and 28 days of age) with uti had co-existing meningitis. both presented with pyrexia, irritability and lethargy, and recovered uneventfully with antibiotic treatment. there were no cases of co-existing meningitis among 499 infants (between 29 days and 12 months  of age) with uti (95% ci: 0.00-0.74%), or any of the 86 children aged 12 months or over (95% ci: 0.00-4.20%). conclusions: these findings indicate that clinicians should have a low threshold to perform a lumbar puncture in neonates with uti, as the risk of co-existing meningitis is not insignificant in this age  group. in contrast, beyond the neonatal period, the risk is small and a more selective approach is warranted.

TI  == dehydratase mediated 1-propanol production in metabolically engineered escherichia coli.
AB  == background: with the increasing consumption of fossil fuels, the question of meeting the global energy demand is of great importance in the near future. as an effective solution, production of higher alcohols from renewable sources by microorganisms has been proposed to address both energy crisis and environmental  concerns. higher alcohols contain more than two carbon atoms and have better physiochemical properties than ethanol as fuel substitutes. results: we designed  a novel 1-propanol metabolic pathway by expanding the well-known 1,2-propanediol  pathway with two more enzymatic steps catalyzed by a 1,2-propanediol dehydratase  and an alcohol dehydrogenase. in order to engineer the pathway into e. coli, we evaluated the activities of eight different methylglyoxal synthases which play crucial roles in shunting carbon flux from glycolysis towards 1-propanol biosynthesis, as well as two secondary alcohol dehydrogenases of different origins that reduce both methylglyoxal and hydroxyacetone. it is evident from our results that the most active enzymes are the methylglyoxal synthase from bacillus subtilis and the secondary alcohol dehydrogenase from klebsiella pneumoniae, encoded by mgsa and budc respectively. with the expression of these two genes and the e. coli ydjg encoding methylglyoxal reductase, we achieved the production of  1,2-propanediol at 0.8 g/l in shake flask experiments. we then characterized the  catalytic efficiency of three different diol dehydratases on 1,2-propanediol and  identified the optimal one as the 1,2-propanediol dehydratase from klebsiella oxytoca, encoded by the operon ppdabc. co-expressing this enzyme with the above 1,2-propanediol pathway in wild type e. coli resulted in the production of 1-propanol at a titer of 0.25 g/l. conclusions: we have successfully established  a new pathway for 1-propanol production by shunting the carbon flux from glycolysis. to our knowledge, it is the first time that this pathway has been utilized to produce 1-propanol in e. coli. the work presented here forms a basis  for further improvement in production. we speculate that dragging more carbon flux towards methylglyoxal by manipulating glycolytic pathway and eliminating competing pathways such as lactate generation can further enhance the production  of 1-propanol.

TI  == ctx-m-15-producing escherichia coli clone b2-o25b-st131 and klebsiella spp. isolates in municipal wastewater treatment plant effluents.
AB  == objectives: the global occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes in bacteria in water environments is an increasing concern. treated wastewater was sampled daily over a 45 day period from the outflow of a municipal wastewater treatment plant in brno, czech republic, and examined for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing bacteria. methods: water samples were cultivated on macconkey agar with cefotaxime (2 mg/l) and individual colonies were examined for esbl production. phenotypic esbl-positive bacteria identified as escherichia coli or klebsiella spp. were tested for the presence of antibiotic resistance genes, the  virulence gene afa/dra and the bla(ctx-m) upstream region. genetic relatedness was analysed by pfge, multilocus sequence typing and plasmid analysis. results: a total of 68 esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates were detected in 34 out of 45 wastewater samples. esbl-producing isolates included 26 e. coli isolates, 4 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates and 1 klebsiella oxytoca isolate. the pandemic and multiresistant b2-o25b-st131 clone was predominant, being detected among 19 e. coli isolates, and 17 of the b2-o25b-st131 isolates were positive for the fia replicon and the afa/dra operon and had an is26 element flanking bla(ctx-m-15). seventeen of the b2-o25b-st131 isolates showed closely related pfge profiles (defined by 84% band similarity) and belonged to identical clonal groups. conclusions: the results highlight the inadequacy of the treatment process in removing multiresistant bacteria from municipal wastewater and point to a risk of transmission of clinically important multiresistant strains, such as the pandemic st131 clone, to the environment. this is the first study demonstrating the pandemic st131 clone in wastewater.

AB  == after the first report in may 2008, the national reference center for susceptibility testing confirmed 113 cases of infection or colonization by kpc-producing members of the family enterobacteriaceae in poland by the end of 2009. the vast majority of patients were found in 18 hospitals; three patients were diagnosed at outpatient clinics. most of the institutions were in the warsaw area, including three hospitals with the highest numbers of cases. when available, the data on previous hospitalizations often indicated that these hospitals were the probable acquisition sites; one patient arrived from new york. the group of 119 unique isolates consisted of klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 114), followed by klebsiella oxytoca (n = 3), and escherichia coli (n = 2). the k. pneumoniae isolates were dominated by the clone sequence type 258 (st258) (n = 111); others were st11 and st23. the st258 group was heterogeneous, with 28 pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) subtypes, approximately 25 plasmid profiles, and nine beta-lactamase patterns differing by kpc variants (kpc-2 mainly), and shv-12, ctx-m-3, and tem-1-like enzymes. plasmids carrying bla(kpc)  genes varied in size (~48 to 250 kb), structure, and conjugation potential. transferable incfii(k) plasmids of ~110 to 160 kb, probably pkpqil or its derivatives, were observed in all k. pneumoniae clones and in k. oxytoca. also prevalent were nontypeable petkp50-like plasmids of ~50 kb, found in k. pneumoniae st258 and e. coli isolates (st93 and st224). two k. pneumoniae-e. coli pairs from single patients might represent the in vivo transfer of such plasmids. the striking diversity of kpc producers at the early stage of dissemination could result from several introductions of these bacteria into the country, their multidirectional evolution during clonal spread, and transfer of the plasmids.

TI  == nosocomial infection and characterization of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases-producing enterobacteriaceae in northeast brazil.
AB  == introduction: extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) are enzymes that degrade  beta-lactam antibiotics and have been reported to be an important cause of nosocomial infection in worldwide. methods: during 2009, 659 enterobacteria strains were isolated from different clinical specimens and tested for esbl production. the disk approximation test, combined disk method and addition of clavulanic acid were used for phenotypic detection of the esbl-producing strains  and pcr for detection of the bla(tem) and bla(ctx-m) genes. results: among the isolates, 125 were esbl producers. the bla(ctx-m) and bla(tem) genes were detected in 90.4% and 75% of the strains, respectively. most strains were isolated from urine. klebsiella pneumoniae was the most prevalent organism. microorganisms presented high resistance to the antibiotics. conclusions: these results support the need for extending esbl detection methods to different pathogens of the enterobacteriaceae family because these methods are only currently standardized by the clsi for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca and proteus mirabilis. carbapenems were the antibiotic class of choice for the treatment of infections caused by esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae.

AB  == background: infantile colic is a common disturb within the first 3 months of life, nevertheless the pathogenesis is incompletely understood and treatment remains an open issue. intestinal gas production is thought to be one of the causes of abdominal discomfort in infants suffering from colic. however, data about the role of the amount of gas produced by infants' colonic microbiota and the correlation with the onset of colic symptoms are scanty. the benefit of supplementation with lactobacilli been recently reported but the mechanisms by which they exert their effects have not yet been fully defined. this study was performed to evaluate the interaction between lactobacillus spp. strains and gas-forming coliforms isolated from stools of colicky infants. results: strains of coliforms were isolated from stools of 45 colicky and 42 control breastfed infants in mcconkey agar and identified using pcr with species-specific primers,  and the bbl enterotube ii system for enterobacteriaceae. gas-forming capability of coliforms was assessed in liquid cultures containing lactose as sole carbon source. the average count of total coliforms in colicky infants was significantly higher than controls: 5.98 (2.00-8.76) log10 vs 3.90 (2.50-7.10) cfu/g of faeces  (p = 0.015). the following strains were identified: escherichia coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae and  enterococcus faecalis. then, 27 lactobacillus strains were tested for their antagonistic effect against coliforms both by halo-forming method and in liquid co-cultures. lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii dsm 20074 and l. plantarum mb 456 were able to inhibit all coliforms strains (halo-forming method), also in liquid co-cultures, thus demonstrating an antagonistic activity. conclusions: this study shows that two out of 27 strains of lactobacillus examined possess an antimicrobial effect against six species of gas-forming coliforms isolated from colicky infants. our findings may stimulate new researches to identify which lactobacillus strains can improve colicky symptoms by acting on coliforms gut colonization.

TI  == mucosal surveillance cultures in predicting gram-negative late-onset sepsis in neonatal intensive care units.
AB  == this study aimed to examine the spectrum and time course of gut and nasopharyngeal colonization with gram-negative micro-organisms, and to define the value of surveillance cultures in predicting late-onset sepsis in neonates admitted to neonatal intensive care units. nasopharyngeal and rectal swabs were collected on admission and twice weekly thereafter in 278 neonates admitted within the first 72 h of life with risk factors of early-onset sepsis. sterile body fluid cultures were obtained on admission and subsequently as clinically indicated. approximately half of the rectal (693/1250, 55%) and nasopharyngeal (558/1153, 48%) samples but only 6% (32/555) of the sterile fluid samples in 26 patients were culture positive for gram-negative organisms. in total, 2108 invasive and mucosal culture pairs were analysed. the overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of a mucosal sample to predict late-onset sepsis were 27%, 66%, 4% and 94%, respectively. patients with  pre-existing colonization with klebsiella pneumoniae (p = 0.011), klebsiella oxytoca (p = 0.002), escherichia coli (p = 0.003), stenotrophomonas spp. (p = 0.003) and pseudomonas spp. (p </= 0.001) were more likely to develop late-onset  sepsis. no such association was found for acinetobacter baumannii, serratia spp.  or enterobacter cloacae. in conclusion, routine mucosal cultures are inefficient  for the prediction of gram-negative late-onset sepsis in neonatal intensive care  units. however, targeted screening for specific organisms in an outbreak (e.g. klebsiella spp., e. coli, stenotrophomonas spp. and pseudomonas spp.) may offer an opportunity to improve infection control measures and enable timely initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy.

TI  == addition of genes for cellobiase and pectinolytic activity in escherichia coli for fuel ethanol production from pectin-rich lignocellulosic biomass.
AB  == ethanologenic escherichia coli strain ko11 was sequentially engineered to contain the klebsiella oxytoca cellobiose phosphotransferase genes (casab) as well as a pectate lyase (pele) from erwinia chrysanthemi, yielding strains ly40a (casab) and jp07 (casab pele), respectively. to obtain an effective secretion of pele, the sec-dependent pathway out genes from e. chrysanthemi were provided on a cosmid to strain jp07 to construct strain jp07c. finally, oligogalacturonide lyase (ogl) from e. chrysanthemi was added to produce strain jp08c. e. coli strains ly40a, jp07, jp07c, and jp08c possessed significant cellobiase activity in cell lysates, while only strains jp07c and jp08c demonstrated extracellular pectate lyase activity. fermentations conducted by using a mixture of pure sugars representative of the composition of sugar beet pulp (sbp) showed that strains ly40a, jp07, jp07c, and jp08c were able to ferment cellobiose, resulting in increased ethanol production from 15 to 45% in comparison to that of ko11. fermentations with sbp at very low fungal enzyme loads during saccharification revealed significantly higher levels of ethanol production for ly40a, jp07c, and  jp08c than for ko11. jp07c ethanol yields were not considerably higher than those of ly40a; however, oligogalacturonide polymerization studies showed an increased  breakdown of biomass to small-chain (degree of polymerization, </=6) oligogalacturonides. jp08c achieved a further breakdown of polygalacturonate to monomeric sugars, resulting in a 164% increase in ethanol yields compared to those of ko11. the addition of commercial pectin methylesterase (pme) further increased jp08c ethanol production compared to that of ly40a by demethylating the pectin for enzymatic attack by pectin-degrading enzymes.

TI  == [validity of using imipenem as a representative carbapenems and levofloxacin as a representative fluoroquinolones in antibiotics susceptibility test for enterobacteriaceae].
AB  == in antimicrobial susceptibility test for enterobacteriaceae, the efficacies of carpapenems are predicted by the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of imipenem, and that of fluoroquinolones are predicted by the mic of levofloxacin.  to assess its judgement, we compared the mics of imipenem, meropenem, panipenem,  and doripenem for carbapenems, and ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, tosufloxacin and  pazufloxacin for fluoroquinolones of clinically isolated enterobacteria, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae and citrobacterfreundii, those resistant to the third generation cephalosporin. mic distributions in low concentration range are estranged in some strains, conspicuously s. marcescens, e. cloacae and c. freundii: meropenem and doripenem displayed low mic value than imipenem and panipenem. since the estrangements are appeared mic value of less than 8 microg/ml, the interpretive results (susceptible, intermediate, resistant) are not affected. in fluoroquinolones, all 4 agents showed almost identical mic distributions, thus the mic of levofloxacin is accepted to use the reference for  other fluoroquinolones. the existence of the strains harboring carbapenem-resistant gene displaying low mic value of carbapenems was reported. for the sensitive detection of the candidate of carbapenem-resistant strains, cut-off value of each carbapenem should be reconsidered, and also other phonotype analysis should be applied. genomic analysis also would be required to detect the carbapenem-resistant gene.

TI  == pharmacokinetics of free ertapenem in critically ill septic patients: intermittent versus continuous infusion.
AB  == background: the aim of this paper was to compare the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (pk/pd) parameters of continuous (ci) and intermittent infusion (iti) of ertapenem into critically ill patients with severe abdominal infections. methods: twenty septic patients hospitalized in a university hospital intensive care unit were enrolled in the study. half of the patients received ertapenem as  an iti 1 g bolus once daily, and the other half of the patients received the same dose via ci over 24 h following a 1-g loading dose. blood was drawn 1, 12 and 24  h after terminating iti or on days 2, 3 and 5 after starting ci for each patient. after centrifugation, the drawn blood was frozen at -80 degrees c until being examined by high-performance liquid-chromatography analysis. results: median serum-free ertapenem concentrations were as follows: fcmax = 98.9 mg/l and fcmin  = 2.5 mg/l for iti, and fcss=15.9 mg/l for ci. the iti and ci median total clearance and volumes of distribution were 2.2 l/h vs. 2.5 l/h and 15.4 l vs. 21.0 l, respectively. the ertapenem mic ranges were as follows: escherichia coli  (0.006 to 0.5 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (0.023 to 0.5 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.023 to 0.5 mg/l), staphylococcus aureus (0.38 to 3 mg/l), streptococcus viridians (0.38 to 3 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (0.38 to 3 mg/l). iti and ci provided steady-state serum-free ertapenem concentrations constantly above the mic for all bacteria. conclusion: ertapenem exhibited satisfactory pk/pd parameters and achieved serum-free concentrations 100% of the time, above even the high mic of extracellular pathogens normally encountered during severe abdominal infections. ci administration resulted in equally effective pk/pd parameters as iti in normal weight, good renal-function patients.

TI  == assessment of an extraction protocol to detect the major mastitis-causing pathogens in bovine milk.
AB  == despite all efforts to control its spread, mastitis remains the most costly disease for dairy farmers worldwide. one key component of better control of this  disease is identification of the causative bacterial agent during udder infections in cows. mastitis is complex, however, given the diversity of pathogens that must be identified. development of a rapid and efficient bacterial species identification tool is thus necessary. this study was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of bacterial dna extraction for the automated molecular detection of major mastitis-causing pathogens directly in milk samples  to complement traditional microbiological identification. extraction and detection procedures were designed and optimized to achieve detection in a respectable time frame, at a reasonable cost, and with a high throughput capacity. the following species were identified: staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae, and klebsiella spp. (including klebsiella oxytoca and klebsiella pneumoniae). the detection procedure includes specific genomic dna amplification  by multiplex pcr for each species, separation by capillary electrophoresis, and laser-assisted automated detection. the specificity of the primers was assessed with a panel of bacteria representing mastitis-negative control species. the extraction protocol comprised multiple steps, starting with centrifugation for fat removal, followed by heating in the presence of a cation exchange resin to trap divalent ions. the analytical sensitivity was 100 cfu/ml for milk samples spiked with staph. aureus, strep. dysgalactiae, and e. coli, with a tendency for  k. pneumoniae. the detection limit was 500 cfu/ml for strep. uberis and strep. agalactiae. the overall diagnostic sensitivity (95.4%) and specificity (97.3%) were determined in a double-blind randomized assay by processing 172 clinical milk samples with microbiological characterization as the gold standard. when the physical nature of the milk samples was too altered, dna purification with a magnetic bead-based system was used. of the apparent false-positive samples, 5 were identified by specific microbiological analysis as true-positive staph. aureus co-infections, with further confirmation by ribosomal 16s sequencing. the  proposed methodology could, therefore, become an interesting tool for automated pcr detection of major mastitis pathogens in dairy cattle.

TI  == the activity of antimicrobial peptide s-thanatin is independent on multidrug-resistant spectrum of bacteria.
AB  == in this study, the activity of s-thanatin (an analog of antimicrobial peptide derived from thanatin) against different bacterial pathogens frequently which can cause therapeutic problems was tested. the result showed minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of s-thanatin against all isolates of the escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella ornithinolytica and klebsiella oxytoca were in the range of 4-16mug/ml, no matter which antibiotic the bacterial was resistant or susceptible, while almost all mics to gram-positive bacterial were >128mug/ml except enterococcus faecium. s-thanatin was more effective toward gram-negative strains, especially for enterobacter and klebsiella. the mics of s-thanatin were no significantly different in the same species regardless of antibiotic sensitive or -resistant isolates to single or multiple antibiotic (p>0.05). likewise, no notable difference could be observed between e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, k. ornithinolytica which were sensitive to s-thanatin (p>0.05). it was implied that the antimicrobial activity of s-thanatin was independent on multi-drug resistance spectrum of bacteria.

TI  == diarrheagenic escherichia coli in acute gastroenteritis in infants in north-west  italy.
AB  == enteropathogenic escherichia coli may cause diarrhoea in infancy, but it is not routinely detected and regarded as a major causative agent. the aim of the present study was to estimate the incidence of enteropathogenic e. coli infection and to investigate its epidemiology and pathogenesis from faecal specimens in infants hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis. between march 2008 and june 2009, faecal samples were collected and examined to recognize diarrhoeal aetiology, especially for e. coli, by cultural identification and multiplex-pcr. e. coli were isolated in 75 of 160 collected samples (46,88%); 10 samples of which (6,3%) had been positively recognised for pathogenic genes. data showed that the presence of diarrheagenic e. coli infection was 6.3%, but it becomes 5% considering e. coli as a unique agent responsible for diarrhoea. the datum is not statistically meaningful because of the small sample (p>0,05). bacterial pathogens were also isolated in 60 samples (37,5% of the total collected samples): 15 salmonella spp., 8 klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 klebsiella oxytoca, 11 citrobacter freundii, 5 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2 serratia spp., 7 enterobacter cloacae, 1 shigella spp., 2 campylobacter spp. rotavirus was the predominant pathogenic single etiologic agent identified. it was found in 35 samples (21.88%  of the overall collected samples), while adenovirus, serotypes 40 or 41, was isolated in 2 samples (1.3%). rotavirus infection was found predominantly in winter with respect to autumn. data provide an interesting epidemiologic survey of enteropathogenic e. coli, which is not usually detected, although it may have  potential clinical implications. abbreviations: cdec, detaching e. coli; daec, diffusely adherent e. coli; eaggec, enteroaggregative e. coli; ehec, enterohaemorrhagic e. coli; eiec, enteroinvasive e. coli; epec, enteropathogenic  e. coli; etec, enterotoxigenic e. coli.

TI  == [investigation of the susceptibilities of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. strains to ertapenem and other carbapenems].
AB  == infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producing escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. constitute severe problems. carbapenems are  commonly used to treat these infections. however, infections caused by carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria show an increasing trend recently. the aim of this study was to investigate the susceptibilities of esbl-producing e.coli and klebsiella spp. to ertapenem and other carbapenems. a total of 239 e.coli, 28 k.pneumoniae and 11 k.oxytoca strains isolated from clinical specimens (208 urine, 16 blood, 26 wound, 17 sterile body fluids, four tracheal aspirates and seven others) of hospitalized patients and outpatients between january 2007-february 2008, were included to the study. the isolates were identified by conventional methods, and antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed by kirby bauer disc diffusion method according to clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) standards. esbl production was tested by double disk diffusion method. when esbl production was indeterminate, cefotaxime-clavulanic acid e test (biomerieux, france) was used. according to the clsi standards modified hodge test was performed for carbapenem resistant isolates and minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values were detected for ertapenem (etest(r), biomerieux, france), imipenem and meropenem (m.i.c. evaluator strips, oxoid, uk). all of the  isolates were found susceptible to amikacin (278/278; 100%), whereas the susceptibility rates for imipenem/meropenem and ertapenem were 99.3% (276/278) and 98.6% (274/278), respectively. when evaluated individually, ertapenem susceptibilities of e.coli, k.pneumoniae and k.oxytoca strains were 99.2%, 96.4%  and 90.9%, respectively, while these rates were 100%, 96.4% and 90.9%, respectively, for imipenem/meropenem. carbapenem resistance was detected in two e.coli, one k.oxytoca and one k.pneumoniae isolates. while two klebsiella spp. isolates were resistant to all of the tested carbapenems (mic > 32 microg/ml), two e.coli isolates were resistant to ertapenem (mic > 32 microg/ml) but susceptible to imipenem (mic= 0.25 microg/ml) and meropenem (mic= 0.5 microg/ml). carbapenemase production was demonstrated by modified hodge test in all of the carbapenem-resistant isolates. in conclusion, esbl-producing gram-negative isolates should be routinely tested with a screening method for carbapenemase activity and confirmation tests should be performed in suspected cases.

TI  == molecular characterization of antimicrobial resistance in gram-negative bacteria  isolated from bovine mastitis in egypt.
AB  == the aim of this study was to characterize the genetic basis of multidrug resistance in gram-negative bacteria isolated from bovine mastitis cases in egypt. multidrug resistance phenotypes were found in 34 of 112 (30.4%) gram-negative bacterial isolates, which harbored at least one antimicrobial resistance gene. the most prevalent multidrug-resistant (mdr) species were enterobacter cloacae (8 isolates, 7.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (7 isolates, 6.3%), klebsiella oxytoca (7 isolates, 6.3%), escherichia coli (5 isolates, 4.5%), and citrobacter freundii (3 isolates, 2.7%). the most commonly observed resistance phenotypes were against ampicillin (97.0%), streptomycin (94.1%), tetracycline (91.2%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (88.2%), nalidixic acid (85.3%), and chloramphenicol (76.5%). class 1 integrons were detected in 28 (25.0%) isolates. the gene cassettes within class 1 integrons included those encoding resistance to trimethoprim (dfra1, dfra5, dfra7, dfra12, dfra15, dfra17, and dfra25), aminoglycosides (aada1, aada2, aada5, aada7, aada12, aada22, and aac(3)-id), chloramphenicol (cmla), erythromycin (erea2), and rifampicin (arr-3). class 2 integrons were identified in 6 isolates (5.4%) with three different profiles. furthermore, the beta-lactamase encoding genes, bla(tem), bla(shv), bla(ctx-m), and bla(oxa), the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes, qnr and aac(6)-ib-cr, and the florfenicol resistance gene, flor, were also identified. to the best of our knowledge, the results identified class 2 integrons, qnr and aac(6)-ib-cr from cases of mastitis for the first time. this is the first report of molecular characterization for antimicrobial resistance in gram-negative bacteria isolated from bovine mastitis in africa.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae screened by the vitek 2 system.
AB  == the vitek 2 automated system (biomerieux) is one of the most widely used instruments in clinical microbiology laboratories for the identification and evaluation of the susceptibility profiles of bacteria including the detection of  extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) produced by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca. currently, the clinical and laboratory standards institute recommends the use of esbl confirmatory tests in addition to standard susceptibility testing. in order to evaluate the accuracy of vitek 2-positive results regarding clinical isolates of e. coli (n = 110) and k.  pneumoniae (n = 72), four additional esbl detection systems were compared: the phoenix automated microbiology system (bd diagnostic systems) and the microscan walkaway-96 system (dade behring), and two manual systems as confirmatory tests,  the etest (ab biodisk) and double disc diffusion (dds) test. epidemiological data regarding the tested strains were also collected and their susceptibility phenotypes were determined. the four methods resulted in concordant results for 126 of the 182 strains. however, the different tests displayed distinct results:  the vitek 2 system was in disagreement in 23.9 % of cases with dds, in 15.3 % with etest, in 23 % with the microscan walkaway-96 system and in 23.6 % with the  phoenix automated microbiology system. epidemiological data indicated that the majority of esbl-positive e. coli strains were isolated from patients admitted to internal medicine wards (72.7 %), whilst k. pneumoniae esbl-positive isolates were equally distributed between internal medicine wards (45.8 %) and intensive care units (45.8 %). most of these strains were isolated from urine. in contrast  to esbl-negative isolates, the esbl-positive strains displayed multiple drug resistance, namely to quinolones, aminoglycosides and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. no significant resistance to carbapenems was detected. overall, this study demonstrates the need for a confirmatory test following positive esbl detection with the vitek 2 system (panel ast-037), which  appears to yield a large number of false-positive results.

AB  == acidification of urine is widely recommended for prevention and treatment of urinary tract infections. we set out to describe the effect of modification of ph on bacterial growth of relevant bacteria as well as on activity of modern fluoroquinolones in urine in vitro. bacterial growth of escherichia coli atcc 25922 and klebsiella oxytoca atcc 700324 was determined in pooled human urine adjusted to ph levels between 5.0 and 8.0. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) and time-kill curves were performed for ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin in ph-adjusted urine and mueller-hinton broth (mhb). uptake of radioactive labeled [c(14)]-ciprofloxacin into bacterial cells was investigated at different phs. while no difference in bacterial growth of e. coli and k. oxytoca was observed at ph values between 5.0 and 8.0, acidification of urine led to major impairment of antimicrobial activity of all tested fluoroquinolones, indicated by an up to 40-fold increase in mic compared to mhb and nearly total neutralization of activity in time-kill experiments. the most probable mechanism  behind this observation may have been reduced uptake of fluoroquinolones into bacterial cells, as indicated by bacterial uptake of [c(14)]-ciprofloxacin and a  reversibility of the effect. the observed reduction in activity of modern fluoroquinolones confirms previous observations from older compounds.

AB  == aims: to identify outbreak episodes of either carriage or infection due to extended spectrum beta-lactamases producing aerobic gram-negative bacilli (agnb-esbl); to establish whether agnb-esbl, sensitive to tobramycin, become resistant over time; and to evaluate the impact of selective decontamination of the digestive tract (sdd) on abnormal carriage of agnb-esbl. design and setting:  all children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (picu) over a 12-month period had biweekly surveillance cultures of throat and rectum and diagnostic cultures when clinically indicated. all agnb were tested for esbl, and the positive isolates were sent for molecular typing. the picu uses sdd (parenteral cefotaxime and enteral polymyxin e/tobramycin) to control abnormal carriage. patients who had at least one agnb-esbl were included in the study. results: during the study period, 1,101 children were admitted to the picu. there were 39  patients (3.5%) with a total of 236 cultures positive for agnb-esbl. twenty-eight patients (2.5%) were carriers, and 11 (1%) had proven infections. organisms isolated from the first culture were 14 patients with klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 with enterobacter cloacae, 7 with citrobacter freundii, 5 with klebsiella oxytoca, and 5 with escherichia coli. in the first sample, 59% of isolates showed tobramycin resistance. molecular typing confirmed that there were five different  strains of k. pneumoniae and that similar strains were not isolated in the same period. conclusions: sdd is an effective measure to control agnb-esbl and to avoid outbreak episodes of either carriage or infection. when tobramycin resistance is found, replacing it with another aminoglycoside based on antibiogram may be more effective in achieving agnb clearance.

TI  == multimerization-defective variants of dodecameric secretin puld.
AB  == the c-terminal core domain of the secretin puld from klebsiella oxytoca forms heat-resistant dodecameric complexes within less than 10min in an escherichia coli in vitro transcription-translation system containing liposomes, and is toxic when made in the cytoplasm without a signal peptide. random mutagenesis of dna encoding this region of puld revealed that amino acid changes throughout almost its entire length abolished toxicity. most of the amino acid substitutions engendered by the mutations retarded or abolished assembly of the dodecameric secretin complex in vitro and/or in the periplasm. only one of the tested multimerization-defective variants could be rescued by co-production and mixed multimer formation with wild-type secretin in vitro. a three amino acid insertion specifically generated in a region of puld that was not affected by the spontaneous mutations formed functional multimers that, unlike the wild-type protein, were dissociated by heating in sds.

TI  == [prevalence of esbl-positive enterobacteriaceae in large moravian hospitals (czech republic)].
AB  == background: bacterial infections have become an important issue in current medicine. recently, their frequency and severity have significantly increased as  a result of the rising number of resistant bacteria. one of important mechanisms  of resistance is production of broad-spectrum beta-lactamases, namely the esbl type. the study aimed at determining the frequency of esbl-positive enterobacteriaceae in three large hospitals in moravia, the eastern part of the czech republic. material and methods: enterobacteriaceae were isolated from clinical material obtained from patients hospitalized in the university hospital  olomouc, teaching hospital ostrava and bata regional hospital zlin throughout 2009. standard microbiology techniques were used for identification. the production of esbls was determined by the modified double-disk synergy test. esbl-positive isolates of escherichia coli from icu patients were subjected to basic genetic analysis. results and conclusion: during the study period, a total  of 12,922 strains from the enterobacteriaceae family were detected. the esbl phenotype was found in 907 cases, i.e. 7 % of all isolates. the most prevalent species of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae were klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca and escherichia coli. a comparison of general wards and icus revealed a higher percentage of esbl-positive strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and a lower proportion of esbl-positive escherichia coli isolates in intensive care patients. when assessing the patients' clinical material, esbl-producing strains were most frequently detected in urine. genetic analysis of esbl-positive escherichia coli strains from icu patients revealed the ctx-m type of esbl production in most isolates.

TI  == characterization and cloning of oxygen-tolerant hydrogenase from klebsiella oxytoca hp1.
AB  == hydrogenase from a hot spring bacterium klebsiella oxytoca hp1 was purified and found to have a specific activity of 199.8 u/mg of protein and a yield of 7.3%. the purified enzyme was determined to consist of six subunits (65, 33, 28, 23, 21 and 18 kda), similar to hydrogenase-3 from escherichia coli, and therefore it was named hyd3. the enzyme displayed remarkable oxygen tolerance. for the purified enzyme, 50% maximal activity was maintained following incubation for 24 h in air  at room temperature. the hydrogenase gene cluster (hyc) was cloned and found to consist of hycd, hyce, hycf, hycdg, hych and hyci genes. hyce and hycg genes encode for the large and small subunit of the hydrogenase, respectively. a hyce gene deletion mutant, deltahyce, was constructed for elucidating the function of  the hyc-operon in hydrogen metabolism. compared with the wild type strain hp1, the mutant strain showed a dramatic decrease in hydrogen production in the presence of formate, sodium pyruvate and glucose under o(2)-stressed conditions,  while substantial activity was detected under anaerobic conditions. this strongly suggests that k. oxytoca hp1 carries a number of hydrogenases or hydrogen metabolic pathways independently of hyd3. however, hyd3 is the main factor responsible for hydrogen production under o(2) stress conditions.

TI  == n15: the linear phage-plasmid.
AB  == the lambdoid phage n15 of escherichia coli is very unusual among temperate phages in that its prophage is not integrated into chromosome but is a linear plasmid molecule with covalently closed ends. upon infection the phage dna circularises via cohesive ends, then phage-encoded enzyme, protelomerase, cuts at an inverted  repeat site and forms hairpin ends (telomeres) of the linear plasmid prophage. replication of the n15 prophage is initiated at an internally located ori site and proceeds bidirectionally resulting in formation of duplicated telomeres. then the n15 protelomerase cuts duplicated telomeres generating two linear plasmid molecules with hairpin telomeres. stable inheritance of the plasmid prophage is ensured by partitioning operon similar to the f factor sop operon. unlike f sop,  the n15 centromere consists of four inverted repeats dispersed in the genome. the multiplicity and dispersion of centromeres are required for efficient partitioning of a linear plasmid. the centromeres are located in n15 genome regions involved in phage replication and control of lysogeny, and binding of partition proteins at these sites regulates these processes. two n15-related lambdoid siphoviridae phages, phiko2 in klebsiella oxytoca and py54 in yersinia enterocolitica, also lysogenize their hosts as linear plasmids, as well as myoviridae marine phages vp882 and vp58.5 in vibrio parahaemolyticus and phihap-1 in halomonas aquamarina. the genomes of all these phages contain similar protelomerase genes, lysogeny modules and replication genes, as well as plasmid-partitioning genes, suggesting that these phages may belong to a group diverged from a common ancestor.

TI  == antibiotic resistant mutants of escherichia coli k12 show increases in heterologous gene expression.
AB  == using a variety of antibiotics, it was found that nine separate isolates of spontaneous antibiotic resistant mutants of escherichia coli k12 ppsx-vioabcde overproduce the anti-tumour antibiotic violacein. subsequent analysis showed that seven of these mutations occurred on the plasmid ppsx-vioabcde. the other two overproducing strains carried spontaneous chromosomal mutations to lincomycin and kanamycin. the kanamycin resistant mutant of e. coli k12 dh10b (aa23) and a lincomycin resistant mutant of e. coli k12 le392 (aa24) increased the synthesis of violacein. the plasmid ppsx-vioabcde opv-1 contains a violacein over-production (opv-1) mutation which when introduced into either e. coli k12 aa23 or aa24, resulted in a hyper-production of violacein. remarkably, e. coli k12 aa23 ppsx-vioabcde opv-1 produced 41 times the normal level of violacein. in  addition, both e. coli k12 aa23 and e. coli k12 aa24 demonstrated an increase in  expression of an alpha amylase gene from streptomyces lividans and the urease gene cluster from klebsiella oxytoca. these results suggest that selection of antibiotic resistant mutants can increase heterologous gene expression in e. coli k12. additionally, the increased expression is a general effect applicable to genes and gene clusters cloned into e. coli k12 from both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == bacterial growth kinetics in acd-a apheresis platelets: comparison of plasma and  pas iii storage.
AB  == background: our objective was to determine the growth kinetics of bacteria in leukoreduced apheresis platelets (lr-ap) in a platelet (plt) additive solution (pas; intersol, fenwal, inc.) compared to lr-ap stored in plasma. study design and methods: hyperconcentrated, double-dose lr-ap were collected from healthy donors with a separator (amicus, fenwal, inc.). lr-ap were evenly divided, intersol was added to half (65% intersol:35% plasma [pas]), and plts in autologous plasma were used for a paired control (pl). bacteria were inoculated into each lr-ap pas/pl pair (0.5-1.6 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml), and bacterial growth was followed for up to 7 days. time to the end of the lag phase, doubling times, maximum concentration (conc-max), and time to maximum concentration (time-max) were estimated. results: streptococcus viridans did not  grow to detectable levels in either pas or pl units. the other bacteria had no significant overall difference in the conc-max (p = 0.47) or time-max (p = 0.7) between pl and pas lr-ap; pl had a 0.14 hours faster doubling rate (p = 0.023); and pas had a 4.7 hours shorter lag time (p = 0.016). conclusion: we observed that five index organisms will grow in lr-ap stored in a 35%:65% ratio of plasma  to intersol where initial bacterial concentrations are 0.5 to 1.6 cfus/ml. the more rapid initiation of log-phase growth for bacteria within a pas storage environment resulted in a bacterial concentration up to 4 logs higher in the pas  units compared to the plasma units at 24 hours, but with no difference in the conc-max. this may present an early bacterial detection advantage for pas-stored  plts.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of intra-abdominal gram-negative bacilli from europe: smart europe 2008.
AB  == as part of the worldwide study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart), a total of 3,030 clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli from intra-abdominal infections were collected from 43 hospital centres from 13 european countries during 2008. of 51 species, the most commonly isolated species were escherichia coli (49.3%), followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (10.5%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (8.6%). respectively, 17.9%, 11.6%, 5.5% and 4.5% of k. pneumoniae, e. coli, proteus mirabilis and k. oxytoca were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-positive. all isolates were tested using a panel of 12 antimicrobial agents, and susceptibilities were determined using european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) clinical breakpoints.  the most active agents against the study isolates (including those producing esbls) were amikacin, ertapenem and imipenem. overall, with the exception of the  carbapenems, most agents exhibited dramatically reduced susceptibilities against  esbl-positive and multi-drug-resistant isolates.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in gram negative bacteria.
AB  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) are a group of plasmid-mediated, diverse, complex and rapidly evolving enzymes that are posing a major therapeutic challenge today in the treatment of hospitalized and community-based patients. infections due to esbl producers range from uncomplicated urinary tract infections to life-threatening sepsis. derived from the older tem is derived from temoniera, a patient from whom the strain was first isolated in greece. beta-lactamases, these enzymes share the ability to hydrolyze third-generation cephalosporins and aztreonam and yet are inhibited by clavulanic acid. in addition, esbl-producing organisms exhibit co-resistance to many other classes of antibiotics, resulting in limitation of therapeutic option. because of inoculum effect and substrate specificity, their detection is also a major challenge. at present, however, organizations such as the clinical and laboratory standards institute (formerly the national committee for clinical laboratory standards) provide guidelines for the detection of esbls in klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis. in common to all esbl-detection  methods is the general principle that the activity of extended-spectrum cephalosporins against esbl-producing organisms will be enhanced by the presence  of clavulanic acid. carbapenems are the treatment of choice for serious infections due to esbl-producing organisms, yet carbapenem-resistant isolates have recently been reported. esbls represent an impressive example of the ability of gram-negative bacteria to develop new antibiotic-resistance mechanisms in the  face of the introduction of new antimicrobial agents. thus there is need for efficient infection-control practices for containment of outbreaks; and intervention strategies, e.g., antibiotic rotation to reduce further selection and spread of these increasingly resistant pathogens.

TI  == laboratory surveillance for prospective plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamases in  the kinki region of japan.
AB  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamases (pabls), and plasmid-mediated metallo-beta-lactamases confer resistance to many beta-lactams. in japan, although several reports exist on the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and metallo-beta-lactamases, the prevalence and characteristics of pabls remain unknown. to investigate the production of pabls,  a total of 22,869 strains of 4 enterobacterial species, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, and proteus mirabilis, were collected  during six 6-month periods from 17 clinical laboratories in the kinki region of japan. pabls were detected in 29 (0.13%) of 22,869 isolates by the 3-dimensional  test, pcr analysis, and dna sequencing analysis. pabl-positive isolates were detected among isolates from 13 laboratories. seventeen of 13,995 (0.12%) e. coli isolates, 8 of 5,970 (0.13%) k. pneumoniae isolates, 3 of 1,722 (0.17%) k. oxytoca isolates, and 1 of 1,182 (0.08%) p. mirabilis isolates were positive for  pabls. of these 29 pabl-positive strains, 20 (69.0%), 6 (20.7%), 2 (6.9%), and 1  (3.4%) carried the genes for cmy-2, dha-1, cmy-8, and mox-1 pabls, respectively.  pattern analysis of randomly amplified polymorphic dna and pulsed-field gel electrophoretic analysis revealed that the prevalence of cmy-2-producing e. coli  strains was not due to epidemic strains and that 3 dha-1-producing k. pneumoniae  strains were identical, suggesting their clonal relatedness. in conclusion, the dha-1 pabls were predominantly present in k. pneumoniae strains, but cmy-2 pabls  were predominantly present in e. coli strains. the present findings will provide  significant information to assist in preventing the emergence and further spread  of pabl-producing bacteria.

TI  == molecular analysis of type 3 fimbrial genes from escherichia coli, klebsiella and citrobacter species.
AB  == background: catheter-associated urinary tract infection (cauti) is the most common nosocomial infection in the united states and is caused by a range of uropathogens. biofilm formation by uropathogens that cause cauti is often mediated by cell surface structures such as fimbriae. in this study, we characterised the genes encoding type 3 fimbriae from cauti strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter koseri and citrobacter freundii. results: phylogenetic analysis of the type 3 fimbrial genes (mrkabcd) from 39 strains revealed they clustered into five distinct clades (a-e) ranging from one to twenty-three members. the majority of sequences grouped in clade a, which was represented by the mrk gene cluster from the genome sequenced k. pneumoniae mgh78578. the e. coli and k. pneumoniae mrkabcd gene sequences clustered together in two distinct clades, supporting previous evidence for the occurrence of inter-genera lateral gene transfer. all of the strains examined caused type 3 fimbriae mediated agglutination of tannic acid treated human erythrocytes despite sequence variation in the mrkd-encoding adhesin gene.  type 3 fimbriae deletion mutants were constructed in 13 representative strains and were used to demonstrate a direct role for type 3 fimbriae in biofilm formation. conclusions: the expression of functional type 3 fimbriae is common to many gram-negative pathogens that cause cauti and is strongly associated with biofilm growth. our data provides additional evidence for the spread of type 3 fimbrial genes by lateral gene transfer. further work is now required to substantiate the clade structure reported here by examining more strains as well  as other bacterial genera that make type 3 fimbriae and cause cauti.

AB  == widespread production of ctx-m type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) in enterobacteriaceae strains which are resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins is the most remarkable example for rapid and global spread of plasmid mediated antimicrobial resistance in bacteria. consecutive 200 esbl producing enterobacteriaceae strains out of 1640 isolates that were obtained from clinical samples (167 urine, 11 wound, 7 bronchoalveolar lavage, 3 peritoneal fluid, 2 cerebrospinal fluid, 2 biopsy, 2 tracheal aspirate, 2 conjunctiva, 1 abscess, 1 catheter) between february to july 2009 in our laboratory were included to this study. among the 200 esbl positive isolates 141 (70.5%) were escherichia coli, 51 (26%) were klebsiella pneumoniae, 5 (2.5%) were enterobacter spp. and one of each (0.5%) citrobacter freundii, klebsiella oxytoca and proteus  mirabilis. esbl positivity was 11% among the 123 community-acquired strains and 13% among the 77 hospital acquired strains, the statistical difference being insignificant (p > 0.05). the prevalence of bla(ctx-m) beta-lactamase genes were  detected by multiplex polymerase chain reaction with the use of two general primer sets: ctx-ma1 and ctx-ma2 primers for the amplification of ctx-m-1, ctx-m-2 and ctx-m-9 enzymes group, and ctx825-f and ctx825-r primers for the amplification of ctx-m-8 and ctx-m-25 enzymes group. bla(ctx-m) genes were detected in 167 out of 200 strains (83.5%). ctx-m production rates in community and hospital acquired strains were found as 86.2% and 79.2%, respectively and no  statistically significant difference was detected (p > 0.05). ctx-m producing strains were either e. coli (n = 132) or klebsiella spp. (n = 35) and were expressing one of the enzymes from ctx-m-1, ctx-m-2 or ctx-m-9 groups. no strains carrying ctx-m-8 or ctx-m-25 group enzymes were detected. ctx-m production rates  in esbl producing e. coli strains in community and hospital were found as 92.5% and 95.7%, respectively, whereas the same rates for esbl producing klebsiella spp. strains were 67.8% and 66.7%. the difference between the ctx-m production rates of community and hospital acquired strains was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). in conclusion, ctx-m prevalence was found high in esbl producing strains of both e. coli and klebsiella spp. since bla(ctx-m) gene acquisition usually results in the emergence of multiple drug-resistant enterobacteriaceae strains, screening for ctx-m type esbl production in the laboratory has an important impact on monitoring the resistant strains which have endemic potential.

AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the photosensitizers rose bengal and erythrosin combined with a light-emitting diode (led) on enterobacteriaceae. twelve enterobacteriaceae strains isolated from the oral cavities of patients undergoing prolonged antibiotic therapy, including three escherichia coli, three enterobacter cloacae, three klebsiella oxytoca and three  klebsiella pneumoniae, were studied. an enterobacteriaceae suspension (10(6) cells/ml) was prepared from each clinical strain isolated from the human oral cavity and subjected to the following treatments: led and rose bengal, led and erythrosin, led and physiological solution, and physiological solution only as control. a blue led unit (460 nm), and rose bengal and erythrosin at a concentration of 50 micromol/l were used. after incubation at 37 degrees c for 48 h, the number of colony-forming units (cfu) was calculated and subjected to analysis of variance (anova). the enterobacterial strains were sensitive to photodynamic therapy with rose bengal. there was a reduction of approximately 7.14 log10 for enterobacter cloacae, 7.73 log10 for escherichia coli, 6.76 log10  for klebsiella pneumoniae and 7.21 log10 for klebsiella oxytoca. however, photodynamic therapy using erythrosin did not reduce the numbers of cfus per milliliter compared to the control group. the use of the led alone had no toxic effect on the strain tested. the enterobacteriaceae strains studied were sensitive to photodynamic therapy with rose bengal.

TI  == influencing factors in the occurrence of injured coliforms in the drinking water  distribution system in the city of la plata, argentina.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the influencing factors in the occurrence of coliforms in the drinking water in la plata (argentina) from june 1999 to june 2001. a total of 180 samples were collected from rio de la plata (102 samples) and puelche aquifer (78 samples); 45 samples were collected for each of the four seasons. the membrane filter procedure was used for isolating bacteria, and each sample was tested for chlorine and ph. the highest percentage  of samples positive for coliforms in the two tested media was obtained in summer  while the highest percentage of negative samples was obtained in winter. no escherichia coli was isolated. the percentage of injured coliforms fluctuated between 70 and 100%. the most frequently isolated bacteria was enterobacter cloacae in summer, enterobacter agglomerans in autumn and klebsiella oxytoca in winter and spring. significant correlations were observed between coliforms and the distance from the initial treatment point, and with the level of free chlorine. we conclude that drinking water contamination in la plata occurs in the distribution system due to increased temperatures and reduced disinfectant levels, which result in bacterial regrowth.

TI  == trends in antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria isolated from blood in jakarta from 2002 to 2008.
AB  == background: this study examined the susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria in the bloodstream to antimicrobials with the aim of providing information relevant  to the guidance of therapy. methodology: blood specimens received by the laboratory of clinical microbiology, faculty of medicine, university of indonesia, from 2002 to 2008, were analyzed for the presence of gram-negative bacteria and their susceptibility to four antibiotic groups frequently administered in hospitals and community settings. results: during the seven-year  period leading up to 2008, approximately 68% of gram-negative bacteria were identified among all positive isolates from blood specimens. the eight most frequent species found were acinetobacter anitratus (25.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.5%), klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae (14.5%), enterobacter aerogenes (8%), salmonella typhi (7.5%), escherichia coli (6.2%), alcaligenes faecalis (5.6%) and klebsiella oxytoca (3.2%). at 80% susceptibility or greater,  ceftriaxone and cefotaxime were active only on e. coli and s. typhi. cefepime demonstrated activity on all eight species tested except k. pneumonia while amikacin showed activity against five species, a. faecalis, e. aerogenes, e. coli, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae and s. typhi. gentamycin was active against three species: e. aerogenes, k. oxytoca and s. typhi. ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin significantly differed in their spectrum: while ciprofloxacin was active against four of the eight species tested (e. aerogenes, e. coli, k. oxytoca, and s. typhi ), levofloxacin was similar to cefepime and was active against all eight species except k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumonia. conclusions: since antimicrobials are broadly used in jakarta, it is important that the information captured in this study be disseminated.

AB  == the prevalence and molecular types of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) were determined during a 1-year period in unselected clinical nonduplicate isolates of escherichia coli (n = 1,738), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 436), and klebsiella oxytoca (n = 208), cultured at the university medical centre nijmegen, the netherlands. isolates identified as esbl producer by the phoenix automated system were collected prospectively and subjected to molecular analysis for the most common esbls tem, shv, and ctx-m, as well as oxa and ges. both the etest esbl and double-disk synergy test were performed as confirmatory tests. the estimated prevalence of esbls was 2.1% in e. coli, 5.2% in k. pneumoniae, and 2.4% in k. oxytoca. tem-12 and -26, shv-5 and -12, and ctx-m groups 1 and 9 were  the most frequent esbls found. isolates identified as esbls by the phoenix were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) in only 42%. in esbl pcr-positive e. coli and k. pneumoniae, both confirmatory tests were positive in 95% of the isolates. in 28% of the etest and 13% of the double-disk synergy test-positive isolates, pcr could not detect any esbl gene. in these cases, other resistance mechanisms may play a role. confirmatory tests were unreliable for k. oxytoca. a  previously described mutation in the k1 enzyme was detected in one ceftazidime-resistant k. oxytoca. the prevalence of esbls in the netherlands is increasing. the predominant molecular types of esbls detected were comparable to  other studies. phoenix esbl results need to be confirmed as advocated by esbl detection guidelines.

TI  == international spread and persistence of tem-24 is caused by the confluence of highly penetrating enterobacteriaceae clones and an inca/c2 plasmid containing tn1696::tn1 and is5075-tn21.
AB  == tem-24 remains one of the most widespread tem-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) among enterobacteriaceae. to analyze the reasons influencing its spread and persistence, a multilevel population genetics study was carried out on 28 representative tem-24 producers from belgium, france, portugal, and spain (13 enterobacter aerogenes isolates, 6 escherichia coli isolates, 6 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 2 proteus mirabilis isolates, and 1 klebsiella oxytoca isolate, from 1998 to 2004). clonal relatedness (xbai pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [pfge] and e. coli phylogroups) and antibiotic susceptibility were determined by standard procedures. plasmid analysis included  determination of the incompatibility group (by pcr, hybridization, and/or sequencing) and comparison of restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) patterns. characterization of genetic elements conferring antibiotic resistance included integrons (classes 1, 2, and 3) and transposons (tn3, tn21, and tn402).  similar pfge patterns were identified among e. aerogenes, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis isolates, while e. coli strains were diverse (phylogenetic groups a, b2, and d). highly related 180-kb inca/c2 plasmids conferring resistance to kanamycin, tobramycin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, and sulfonamides were identified. each plasmid contained defective in0-tn402 (dfra1-aada1, aaca4, or aaca4-aacc1-orfe-aada2-cmla1) and in4-tn402 (aaca4 or dfra1-aada1) variants. these integrons were located within tn21, tn1696, or hybrids of these transposons, with is5075 interrupting their irtnp and irmer. in all cases, blatem-24 was part of an is5075-deltatn1 transposon within tnp1696, mimicking other genetic elements containing blatem-2 and blatem-3 variants. the international dissemination of tem-24 is fuelled by an inca/c2 plasmid acquired by different enterobacterial clones which seem to evolve by gaining diverse genetic elements. this work highlights the risks of a confluence between highly penetrating clones and highly promiscuous plasmids in the spread of antibiotic resistance, and it contributes to the elucidation of the origin and evolution of  tem-2 esbl derivatives.

TI  == characterization of stable fly (diptera: muscidae) larval developmental habitat at round hay bale feeding sites.
AB  == in this study, we examined the stable fly, stomoxys calcitrans (l.) (diptera: muscidae), larval developmental habitat within the round hay bale feeding sites on cattle pastures, and we identified three zones with distinct characteristics around two types of hay feeders (ring and cone). the parameters monitored in each zone included stable fly emergence, substrate temperature, moisture, ph, thickness of hay-manure layer, and concentration of fecal coliform bacteria (escherichia coli and klebsiella oxytoca) as indicators of fecal material. all measurements were conducted during the period of high stable fly prevalence (hsf) in may-june and low stable fly prevalence (lsf) in july-august to better understand the environmental factors influencing stable fly seasonality. substrate temperature and fecal coliform concentration were the only two significantly different factors between hsf and lsf. temperatures ranged from 21  to 25 degrees c during hsf versus 25-30 degrees c in lsf but all were within the  range for successful stable fly development. fecal coliform concentrations ranged from 4.2 x 10(3) to 4.1 x 10(4) colony-forming units (cfu)/g of the substrate during hsf and from undetectable (<10) to 100 cfu/g during lsf. furthermore, we evaluated the effect of different hay:manure ratios (0:1, 1:1, 2:1, and 5:1) on stable fly development (egg to adult). temperature was significantly higher and stable fly developmental time significantly shorter in all substrates containing  hay when compared with that of manure alone, but no significant differences were  detected in stable fly emergence among the substrates. these results strongly indicate that the fecal microbial community plays an important role in stable fly larval development in hay feeding sites and that it is the main factor behind stable fly developmental seasonality on pastures. our results also demonstrate that animal manure mixed with hay provides conditions for faster stable fly development than manure alone; however, hay does not significantly affect overall stable fly emergence.

AB  == this study shows for the first time the mechanism of carbapenem resistance of a klebsiella oxytoca clinical isolate zc101 recovered from a zhejiang university hospital in hangzhou, china. mic values of imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem for k. oxytoca zc101 were 16, 16, and 128 microg/ml, respectively. conjugation experiments demonstrated the transferability of a resistance determinant from k.  oxytoca zc101 to escherichia coli ec600. results from isoelectric focusing, polymerase chain reactions, and dna sequencing confirmed that k. oxytoca zc101 produced imp-4 metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl) and ctx-m-14 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, whereas e. coli transconjugant only produced the imp-4. amplification of integron revealed that bla(imp-4) gene is located within a class i integron that was carried in a plasmid approximately 55 kb in size. sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis profiling of outer membrane proteins of k. oxytoca zc101 indicated lack of expression of the ompk36 porin. dna sequence analysis of ompk36 gene of k. oxytoca zc101 showed the gene was disrupted by an insertion sequence is5. in all, the results show that plasmid-mediated imp-4 mbl production combined with the loss of ompk36 porin caused the resistance in k. oxytoca zc101 to carbapenems.

AB  == we evaluated boronic acid (ba)-based methods for their ability to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) among clinical isolates of kpc-producing members of the enterobacteriaceae family. a total of 155 isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 141), escherichia coli (n = 6), enterobacter aerogenes (n = 6), and klebsiella oxytoca (n = 2) genotypically confirmed to be kpc producers were analyzed. as many as 118 isolates harbored esbls (103 harbored shv-type esbls, 13 harbored ctx-m-type esbls, and 2 harbored both shv- and ctx-m-type esbls); the remaining 37 isolates were genotypically negative for esbl production. the clsi esbl confirmatory test was positive for 79 of the 118 esbl producers (sensitivity, 66.9%), while all 37 non-esbl producers were negative (specificity, 100%). when a > or =5-mm increase in the zone diameter of either the cefotaxime (ctx)-clavulanate (ca) or the ceftazidime (caz)-ca disks containing ba compared with the zone diameter of the ctx or caz disks containing  ba was considered to be a positive result for esbl production, the method detected all 118 esbl producers (sensitivity, 100%) and showed no false-positive  results for non-esbl producers (specificity, 100%). double-disk synergy tests, in which disks of ctx, caz, aztreonam, or cefepime in combination with ba were placed at distances of 20, 25, and 30 mm (center to center) from a disk containing amoxicillin (amoxicilline)-clavulanate-ba, were able to detect 116 (98.3%), 101 (85.6%), and 28 (23.7%) of the esbl-positive isolates, respectively; no false-positive results for non-esbl-producing isolates were detected. our results demonstrate that the modified clsi esbl confirmatory test with antibiotic disks containing ba is the most accurate phenotypic method for the detection of esbls in enterobacteriaceae producing kpc carbapenemases.

TI  == phenotypic characterization of human pathogenic bacteria in fish from the coastal waters of south west cameroon: public health implications.
AB  == increasing economic and recreational opportunities, attractive scenery and a perception of a better quality of life are luring people to the coast. unfortunately, these activities together with the commensurate increase in population in the area inevitably result in pollution of coastal waters with excessive microorganisms and other pollutants. microbial pollutants not only contaminate the coastal water but also aquatic food sources, thus posing a health risk to consumers. fish is a major source of protein in cameroon, especially in the coastal areas. in this study, we investigated the microbiological quality of  fish from the limbe and tiko beaches in south west cameroon from may to october 2007. we isolated human pathogenic bacteria from three anatomic sites (skin, gills, intestine) of 50 fish (150 specimens) and investigated their susceptibility patterns to a battery of antibiotics. data were analyzed statistically using chi2 with significance set at p < .05. eleven bacterial species were identified, including escherichia coli type 1 (20.8%), citrobacter fruendii (16.4%), proteus vulgaris (13%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12.1%), klebsiella ozaenae (7.7%), enterobacter cloacae (7.2%), klebsiella oxytoca (5.8%), serratia marcescens (4.8%), serratia odorifera (4.8%), hafnia alvei (4.4%) and proteus penneri (2.9%). more contaminated fish were found at limbe beach than at tiko beach (61.4% versus 38.6%, respectively (p < .05)). when ranking contamination with respect to anatomic site, skin was the most contaminated (40.6%) specimen and gills the least (28.5%). ciprofloxacillin, ofloxacillin, and cotrimoxazole were the most effective antibiotics against all isolates, exhibiting 100% sensitivity. almost half of the isolates (45.7%) were resistant to ampicillin. the results of our study demonstrate that fish from the  coastal waters of south west cameroon are a source of human pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria; hence this finding has public health implications.

TI  == detection of enterobacter sakazakii and other pathogens associated with infant formula powder by use of a dna microarray.
AB  == pathogen detection is critical to the process of generating and testing powdered  infant formula (pif). an obstacle associated with pif microbial surveillance is that most current procedures are time-consuming and labor-intensive. we have developed a rapid, dna microarray-based detection technique to identify 10 different pathogenic bacteria associated with pif contamination based on the 16s-23s rrna gene internal transcribed spacer (its) sequences and wzy (o antigen  polymerase) gene. using this procedure, enterobacter sakazakii, salmonella enterica, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter baumannii, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus  aureus, and escherichia coli o157 were identified. one hundred eighty-five strains were used to validate the microarray assay (including 134 target pathogen strains and 51 closely related bacteria). twenty-seven probes reproducibly detected multiple pathogens with high specificity and sensitivity (0.100 ng genomic dna or 10(4) cfu/ml). twenty-one real pif samples were tested by the microarray with 100% accuracy. the data presented reveal that the designed oligonucleotide microarray is a promising method for basic microbiology, clinical diagnosis, food safety, and epidemiological surveillance.

TI  == [typing of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. strains and analysis of plasmid profiles].
AB  == the aim of this study was to identify the types of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) produced by 12 escherichia coli and 32 klebsiella spp. (28 k. pneumoniae, 4 k. oxytoca) strains isolated from various specimens (urine, blood, tracheal aspirate, abscess, throat, drain/catheter tips, pleural/peritoneal fluids, cerebrospinal fluid, eye) of patients hospitalized in  different units (intensive care, hematology, oncology neonatology, transplantation, pediatric surgery) of istanbul medical faculty hospital, turkey. antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed by disc diffusion according to  nccls (clsi) guidelines and no resistance to imipenem or meropenem was detected.  mics of cefotaxime and ceftazidime were determined by agar dilution method and mic50 and mic90 for cefotaxime were found as 16 microg/ml and 64 microg/ml in both klebsiella spp. and e. coli strains, respectively. the presence of esbl was  confirmed by double-disc synergy testing and e-test esbl. all isolates demonstrated an esbl phenotype by these two methods. isoelectric focusing (ief) method demonstrated that the isolates produced 1-4 different beta-lactamases (pls: 5.4-9.0). the rates of tem, shv, ctx-m beta-lactamases detected by using specific primers in polymerase chain reaction (pcr), were found as 64.3%, 92.9%,  64.3% for k. pneumoniae and 66.7%, 25%, 83.3%, for e.coli strains, respectively.  the profiles generated by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr using eric-2 primer revealed several bands, ranging in size from 170 to 1500 bp. according to rapd-pcr results, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca and e. coli strains were separated to 10, 3 and 6 groups, respectively. in the conjugation experiments, 31 of the isolates (70.4%) transferred their resistance genes to recipient e. coli strain. plasmid analysis studies showed that resistance genes were carried on a single plasmid (> 48 kb) in 20 transconjugants (64.5%), while the rest of the strains (35.5%) harbored more than one plasmid, with sizes ranging from 10 to 100 kb. these results showed the rapid emergence and high prevalence of ctx-m type enzymes among klebsiella spp. and e. coli strains in our hospital.

TI  == infections in patients with aplastic anemia.
AB  == infection is a major cause of death in patients with aplastic anemia (aa). there  are differences between the immunocompromised state of a patient with aa and the  patient who is neutropenic due to chemotherapy and this leads to a difference in  the infections that they incur. prolonged neutropenia is one of the largest risk  factors for the development of infections with the invasive mycoses and bacteria. recovery from neutropenia is directly related to survival, and supportive care plays a large role in protection while the patient is in a neutropenic state. the most common invasive mycoses include the aspergillus species, zygomycetes, candida spp., and fusarium spp. bacterial infections that are seen in patients with aa include gram-positive coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, enterococcus, staphylococus aureus, clostridium spp., micrococcus, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, listeria monocytogenes, and bacillus cereus. gram-negative infections including gram-negative bacilli, escherichia coli, salmonella, bacteroides fragilis, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumonia, aeromonas hydrophilia, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vibrio vulnificus. viral infections are much less common but include those that belong to the herpesviridae family, community-acquired respiratory viral infection, and the viral hepatitides a, b, and c. evidence of the parasite strongyloides stercoralis has also been documented. this review discusses the major invasive fungal infections, bacterial pathogens, parasites, and viral infections that are found in patients with aa who are treated with immunosuppressive therapy. the specific  immune impairment and current treatment parameters for each of these classes of infection will also be discussed.

TI  == can we rely on one laboratory test in detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae? an evaluation of the vitek 2 system and comparison with four other detection methods in kuwait.
AB  == background and aims: clinical hospitals need to correctly identify extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing bacteria in infected patients to correctly treat the patient and avoid spreading antibiotic resistance. kuwaiti hospitals use one laboratory test for detecting esbl bacteria. this study evaluated whether that was sufficient to detect esbl bacteria, and compared the vitek system with other detection systems. methods: (klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, k oxytoca and enterobacter cloacae) were collected from five different kuwaiti main hospitals, all of which were flagged as esbl-positive by the vitek 2 system. the isolates were retested by the vitek 2 system, and were also tested by double disc diffusion (ddd), the disc approximation test, the e-test and the microscan system for the detection of esbls. results: retesting with the vitek system revealed 100% compatibility with the results of the source  hospitals. the microscan system, ddd, disc approximation test and e-test could detect esbl in 199, 192, 178 and 205 isolates, respectively. conclusions: technically, the microscan and vitek 2 systems were the least demanding method to detect esbl as it is an integral part of the routine susceptibility test card. e-test strips were reliable but the most expensive of all techniques used. the ddd test and disc approximation, while relatively inexpensive, were technically subjective. the vitek system may be very suitable in clinical laboratories, but would be better if accompanied with another test for detection of esbl bacteria.

AB  == disinfected and non-disinfected samples have been used to determine the accuracy  of the iso procedure (iso 9308-1) for detection of e. coli in drinking water. samples were analysed using the iso procedure at both 36 and 44 degrees c and using the defined substrate technology method colilert-18/quanti-tray (colilert-18). utilizing the confirmation procedure described in iso 9308-1, large numbers of false positive e. coli results were obtained using the iso primary isolation procedure at 36 degrees c. however, when glucuronidase production was used as the confirmation procedure, the 'confirmed' count of e. coli was lowest with iso 9308-1 performed at 36 degrees c. when ttc medium was incubated at 36 degrees c confirmation using production of indole at 44 degrees c resulted in 29% more 'e. coli' being recovered than when confirmation was performed using production of glucuronidase. when 44 degrees c was used as the primary isolation temperature the difference between the number of 'confirmed' e. coli identified using the two confirmation procedures was less than 1% and was not significant. identification of isolates which 'confirmed' when using production of indole at 44 degrees c as the test method but which failed to produce beta-d-glucuronidase, showed that the majority of these isolates were klebsiella oxytoca.

TI  == introduction of an nadh regeneration system into klebsiella oxytoca leads to an enhanced oxidative and reductive metabolism of glycerol.
AB  == redox cofactors play crucial roles in the metabolic and regulatory network of living organisms. we reported here the effect of introducing a heterogeneous nadh regeneration system into klebsiella oxytoca on cell growth and glycerol metabolism. expression of fdh gene from candida boidinii in k. oxytoca resulted in higher intracellular concentrations of both nadh and nad(+) during the fermentation metaphase, with the ratio of nadh to nad(+) unaltered and cell growth unaffected, interestingly different from that in engineered escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis, and others. metabolic flux analysis revealed that fluxes to 1,3-propanediol, ethanol, and lactate were all increased, suggesting both the oxidative and reductive metabolisms of glycerol were enhanced. it demonstrates that in certain microbial system nadh availability can be increased  with nadh to nad(+) ratio unaltered, providing a new strategy to improve the metabolic flux in those microorganisms where glycolysis is not the only central metabolic pathways.

TI  == nationwide surveillance in taiwan of the in-vitro activity of tigecycline against clinical isolates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == tigecycline in-vitro surveillance in taiwan (tist), initiated in 2006, is a nationwide surveillance programme designed to monitor longitudinally the in-vitro activity of tigecycline against commonly encountered resistant bacteria. this study compared the in-vitro activity of tigecycline against clinical isolates of  resistant gram-negative bacteria determined by the broth microdilution and etest  methods. a total of 622 isolates were collected from patients treated at 20 teaching hospitals. tigecycline had excellent in-vitro activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli (n = 275) with mic(90) 0.5 microg/ml and a 99.6% susceptibility rate, and also against esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 324) with mic(90) 2 microg/ml and a 98.5% susceptibility rate. for esbl-producing proteus mirabilis (n = 15) the mic(90) was 4 microg/ml with a 73.3% susceptibility rate. for esbl-producing klebsiella oxytoca (n = 8) the mic(50) and mic(90) were 0.5 and 1 microg/ml, respectively, with a 100% susceptibility rate. limited agreement (<80%) was found between the broth microdilution and the etest methods when determining the in-vitro activity of tigecycline against esbl- producing k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca.

TI  == microbiological and toxicological effects of perla black bean (phaseolus vulgaris l.) extracts: in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB  == we investigated the microbiological and toxicological effects of three perla black bean extracts on the growth and culture of selected pathogenic microorganisms, the toxicity over vero cell lines and an in vivo rat model. three different solvents were used to obtain perla black bean extracts. all three perla black bean extracts were tested for antibacterial and antiparasitic activity and  further analysed for intrinsic cytotoxicity (ic(50)). methanol perla black bean extract was used for acute toxicity test in rats, with the up-and-down doping method. all perla black bean extracts inhibited bacterial growth. pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris, klebsiella oxytoca, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and listeria monocytogenes showed inhibition, while escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes did not. acidified water and acetic acid perla black bean extract were tested in parasites. the best ic(50) was observed for giardia lamblia, while higher concentrations were active against entamoeba histolytica and trichomonas vaginalis. the vero cells toxicity levels (ic(50)) for methanol, acidified water  and acetic acid perla black bean extract were [mean +/- s.d. (95% ci)]: 275 +/- 6.2 (267.9-282.0), 390 +/- 4.6 (384.8-395.2) and 209 +/- 3.39 (205.6-212.4) microg/ml, respectively. in vivo acute toxicity assays did not show changes in absolute organ weights, gross and histological examinations of selected tissues or functional tests. the acetic acid and methanol perla black bean extract proved to exhibit strong antibacterial activity and the acidified water perla black bean extract exerted parasiticidal effects against giardia lamblia, entamoeba hystolitica and trichomonas vaginalis. the three perla black bean extracts assayed over vero cells showed very low toxicity and the methanol perla black bean extract in vivo did not cause toxicity.

TI  == evaluation of chromagar ctx, a novel medium for isolating ctx-m-esbl-positive enterobacteriaceae while inhibiting ampc-producing strains.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to evaluate chromagar ctx (chromagar france), a novel agar for the selective isolation of enterobacteriaceae expressing the bla(ctx-m) gene in the presence of enteric bacteria expressing ampc enzymes. methods: a panel of 150 gram-negative bacteria (mainly escherichia  coli, enterobacter, klebsiella, pseudomonas and salmonella) isolated from humans  and animals were assembled for the purpose of evaluating chromagar ctx and comparing it with chromagar ecc with the addition of 1, 2, 4 and 8 mg/l cefotaxime or ceftazidime and with biomerieux extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-bx agar. chromagar ctx was also assessed for its ability to isolate bla(ctx-m) strains from farm animal faeces (n = 342). results: the panel contained ctx-m-positive (n = 70) strains (ctx-m types 1, 9, 14 and 15), esbls (n = 31) belonging to other families (oxa, per, shv, tem, veb), strains positive for ampc genes (n = 31), strains that overexpressed ampc (n = 6), non-esbl/ampc strains (n = 11) and klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1). chromagar ctx was superior to other agars tested for selective isolation of enterobacteriaceae expressing the bla(ctx-m) gene with 100% sensitivity and 64.2% specificity for ctx-m strains in  the panel and 90.1% of the colonies from animal faeces plated on chromagar ctx were ctx-m strains. conclusions: chromagar ctx is a valuable agar in situations where it is important to isolate bla(ctx-m) strains in the presence of ampc strains. the agar may be particularly useful in veterinary studies, where ampc-producing commensal e. coli can be encountered reasonably frequently in the  enteric flora of some animal species and may also be useful, following further evaluation, for samples from humans.

AB  == 1,310 enterobacteriaceae, 242 pseudomonas aeruginosa and 97 acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates collected at a cancer hospital in bulgaria were screened for the presence of 16s rrna methylases. the arma methylase gene was identified in 20 (1.5%) enterobacteriaceae (7 klebsiella pneumoniae, 3 escherichia coli, 3 serratia marcescens, 3 citrobacter freundii , 3 enterobacter  cloacae and 1 klebsiella oxytoca). arma-mediated aminoglycoside resistance was transferable by conjugation and carried by closely related incl/m plasmids which  also carried ant3"9, dfrxii, sul1, bla(tem-1), and bla(ctx-m-3) genes encoding resistance to streptomycin-spectinomycin, trimethoprim, sulfonamides, and ss-lactams, respectively. most of the isolates were genetically different according to pfge but shared similar restriction patterns of the arma -encoding plasmids. our findings highlight the strong association of arma and bla(ctx-m-3)  extended-spectrum ss-lactamase genes across various species in the family enterobacteriaceae . the spread of multiresistant isolates expressing 16s rrna methylases and esbls is a worrisome development requiring continuous monitoring.

TI  == type ii secretion system secretin puld localizes in clusters in the escherichia coli outer membrane.
AB  == the cellular localization of a chimera formed by fusing a monomeric red fluorescent protein to the c terminus of the klebsiella oxytoca type ii secretion system outer membrane secretin puld (puld-mcherry) in escherichia coli was determined in vivo by fluorescence microscopy. like puld, puld-mcherry formed sodium dodecyl sulfate- and heat-resistant multimers and was functional in pullulanase secretion. chromosome-encoded puld-mcherry formed fluorescent foci on the periphery of the cell in the presence of high (plasmid-encoded) levels of its cognate chaperone, the pilotin puls. subcellular fractionation demonstrated that  the chimera was located exclusively in the outer membrane under these circumstances. a similar localization pattern was observed by fluorescence microscopy of fixed cells treated with green fluorescent protein-tagged affitin,  which binds with high affinity to an epitope in the n-terminal region of puld. at lower levels of (chromosome-encoded) puls, puld-mcherry was less stable, was located mainly in the inner membrane, from which it could not be solubilized with urea, and did not induce the phage shock response, unlike puld in the absence of  puls. the fluorescence pattern of puld-mcherry under these conditions was similar to that observed when puls levels were high. the complete absence of puls caused  the appearance of bright and almost exclusively polar fluorescent foci.

TI  == nhsn annual update: antimicrobial-resistant pathogens associated with healthcare-associated infections: annual summary of data reported to the national healthcare safety network at the centers for disease control and prevention, 2006-2007.
AB  == objective: to describe the frequency of selected antimicrobial resistance patterns among pathogens causing device-associated and procedure-associated healthcare-associated infections (hais) reported by hospitals in the national healthcare safety network (nhsn). methods: data are included on hais (ie, central line-associated bloodstream infections, catheter-associated urinary tract infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and surgical site infections) reported to the patient safety component of the nhsn between january 2006 and october 2007. the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing of up to 3 pathogenic isolates per hai by a hospital were evaluated to define antimicrobial-resistance in the pathogenic isolates. the pooled mean proportions  of pathogenic isolates interpreted as resistant to selected antimicrobial agents  were calculated by type of hai and overall. the incidence rates of specific device-associated infections were calculated for selected antimicrobial-resistant pathogens according to type of patient care area; the variability in the reported rates is described. results: overall, 463 hospitals reported 1 or more hais: 412  (89%) were general acute care hospitals, and 309 (67%) had 200-1,000 beds. there  were 28,502 hais reported among 25,384 patients. the 10 most common pathogens (accounting for 84% of any hais) were coagulase-negative staphylococci (15%), staphylococcus aureus (15%), enterococcus species (12%), candida species (11%), escherichia coli (10%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%), klebsiella pneumoniae (6%),  enterobacter species (5%), acinetobacter baumannii (3%), and klebsiella oxytoca (2%). the pooled mean proportion of pathogenic isolates resistant to antimicrobial agents varied significantly across types of hai for some pathogen-antimicrobial combinations. as many as 16% of all hais were associated with the following multidrug-resistant pathogens: methicillin-resistant s. aureus (8% of hais), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (4%), carbapenem-resistant p. aeruginosa (2%), extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant k. pneumoniae (1%), extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant e. coli (0.5%), and carbapenem-resistant a. baumannii, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, and e. coli (0.5%). nationwide, the majority of units reported no hais due to these antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.

TI  == non-susceptibility trends among enterobacteriaceae from bacteraemias in the uk and ireland, 2001-06.
AB  == background: enterobacteriaceae are common agents of bacteraemia, with escherichia coli accounting for 20% of the cases. reflecting this importance, members of the  family constitute 4 of the 12 collection groups in the british society for antimicrobial chemotherapy (bsac) bacteraemia surveillance programme. methods: mics from the bsac surveillance programme were reviewed, along with bacteraemia reports received by the health protection agency (hpa) via its cosurv/labbase system. isolates with unusual resistances were subjected to molecular analysis. results: the bsac and hpa systems both revealed dramatically increasing resistance to cephalosporins, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin among e. coli and klebsiella spp., with cephalosporin resistance largely contingent on the spread of ctx-m extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls); fluoroquinolone resistance also increased among proteus mirabilis and esbl-negative e. coli. carbapenem resistance remained extremely rare, but two enterobacter spp., from the same patient in different years, had kpc carbapenemases, while a few isolates had carbapenem resistance contingent upon combinations of beta-lactamase and impermeability, and ertapenem mics for ampc-derepressed enterobacter spp. rose over time. three new agents-ceftobiprole, doripenem and tigecycline-were tested.  ceftobiprole was broadly active, except against esbl producers and klebsiella oxytoca hyperproducing k1 enzyme, and was variable against ampc-derepressed enterobacter spp. and against proteus vulgaris. doripenem was more potent than imipenem. tigecycline was almost universally active against e. coli, but low-level non-susceptibility (mic 2 mg/l) was frequent among klebsiella spp. conclusions: e. coli and klebsiella spp. showed dramatic shifts, with sharply rising non-susceptibility to cephalosporins, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. the rise in cephalosporin resistance reflected dissemination of ctx-m esbls. carbapenems remain broadly active and new agents offer potential.

TI  == horizontol dissemination of tem- and shv-typr beta-lactamase genes-carrying resistance plasmids amongst clonical isolates of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing bacteria have been isolated at increasing frequency worldwide. expression of esbl is often associated with multidrug resistance and dissemination by resistance plasmids. during a two-month period in 2000, 133 clinical isolates of enterobacterial strains were randomly collected from outpatients and inpatients at a university hospital in turkey. the esbl producing strains were determined by double-disk synergy (dds) testing. twenty esbl producing strains (15%) including escherichia coli (n = 9), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 7), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 2) and enterobacter aerogenes (n = 2) were detected and further analyzed for their resistance transfer features, plasmid profile and nature of the resistance genes. plasmid transfer assays were performed using broth mating techniques. tem- and shv- genes were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and hybridization using specific probes. ecori restriction enzyme analyses of r plasmids were used in the detection of epidemic plasmids. fourteen plasmid profiles (a, b1, b2, c1, and c2  to l) were obtained with ecori restriction enzyme analysis. most of these plasmids were detected to carry both tem- and shv-derived genes by pcr, and confirmed by localizing each gene by hybridization assay. epidemiological evidence indicated that there was an apparent horizontal dissemination of conjugative r plasmids among multidrug-resistant enterobacterial genera and species in this hospital.

AB  == synthesis of the klebsiella oxytoca outer membrane secretin puld, or its membrane-associated core domain, in a liposome-supplemented escherichia coli in vitro transcription-translation system resulted in the formation of multimers that appeared as typical dodecameric secretin rings when examined by negative-stain electron microscopy. cryo-electron microscopy of unstained liposomes and differential extraction by urea indicated that the secretin particles were inserted into the liposome membranes. when made in the presence of the detergent brij-35, puld and the core domain were synthesized as monomers. both proteins caused almost immediate growth cessation when synthesized in e. coli without a signal peptide. the small amounts of puld synthesized before cell  death appeared as multimers with characteristics similar to those of the normal outer membrane secretin dodecamers. it was concluded that multimerization and membrane insertion are intrinsic properties of secretin puld that are independent of a specific membrane environment or membrane-associated factors. the closely related erwinia chrysanthemi secretin outd behaved similarly to puld in all assays, but the more distantly related neisseria meningitidis secretin pilq did not form multimers either when made in vitro in the presence of liposomes or when made in e. coli without its signal peptide. this is the first report of the apparently spontaneous in vitro assembly and membrane insertion of a large outer  membrane protein complex. spontaneous multimerization and insertion appear to be  restricted to outer membrane proteins closely related to puld.

AB  == the phoenix automated microbiology system (bd diagnostics, sparks, md) is designed for the rapid identification (id) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (ast) of clinically significant human bacterial pathogens. we evaluated the performance of the phoenix instrument in comparison with that of the microscan walkaway system (dade behring, west sacramento, ca) in the id and ast of gram-negative clinical strains and challenge isolates of enterobacteriaceae (n = 150) and nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli (nfgnb; 45 clinical isolates and 8 challenge isolates). id discrepancies were resolved with the api 20e and api 20ne conventional biochemical id systems (biomerieux, durham, nc). the standard disk diffusion method was used to resolve discordant ast results. the overall percentages of agreement between the phoenix id results and the microscan results at the genus and species levels for clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae were  98.7 and 97.7%, respectively; following resolution with conventional biochemical  testing, the accuracy of the phoenix system was determined to be 100%. for nfgnb, the levels of agreement were 100 and 97.7%, respectively. both systems incorrectly identified the majority of the uncommon nonfermentative nonpseudomonal challenge isolates recovered from cystic fibrosis patients; these  isolates are not included in the databases of the respective systems. for ast of  enterobacteriaceae, the rate of complete agreement between the phoenix results and the microscan results was 97%; the rates of very major, major, and minor errors were 0.3, 0.2, and 2.7%, respectively. for nfgnb, the rate of complete agreement between the phoenix results and the microscan results was 89.1%; the rates of very major, major, and minor errors were 0, 0.5, and 7.7%, respectively. following the confirmatory testing of nine clinical isolates initially screened by the microscan system as possible extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing organisms (seven klebsiella pneumoniae isolates and two escherichia coli isolates), complete agreement was achieved for eight isolates (one esbl positive and seven negative); one false positive was obtained with the  phoenix instrument. the microscan system correctly detected the 10 esbl challenge isolates, versus the 6 detected by the phoenix system. overall, there was good correlation between the phoenix instrument and the microscan system for the id and ast of enterobacteriaceae and common nfgnb. the phoenix system is a reliable  method for the id and ast of the majority of clinical strains encountered in the  clinical microbiology laboratory. until additional performance data are available, results for all klebsiella pneumoniae or klebsiella oxytoca and e. coli isolates screened and confirmed as esbl producers by any automated system should be confirmed by alternate methods prior to the release of final results.

TI  == effects of mn(ii) and fe(ii) on microbial removal of arsenic (iii).
AB  == goal, scope, and background: arsenic contamination in groundwater creates severe  health problems in the world. there are many physiochemical and biological methods available for remediation of arsenic from groundwater. among them, microbial remediation could be taken as one of the least expensive methods, though it takes longer treatment time. the main objective of this research was to study the improvement on remediation by addition of some essential ion salts such as mn and fe. materials and methods: staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, klebsiella oxytoca, and escherichia coli were taken as model microbes from dhulikhel, 30 km east from kathmandu, nepal. results and discussion: microbes used in this study showed different abilities in their removal of as(iii) with and without addition of mn and fe salts. the trend of remediation increased with  time. s. aureus was found to be the best among the microbes used. it showed almost 100% removal after 48-h culture, both with and without fe and mn salts. rate of removal of as increased with addition of fe and mn for all microbes. removal efficiency was found to increase by about 32% on average after addition of salts in 24-h cultures of s. aureus.

TI  == medical-grade honey kills antibiotic-resistant bacteria in vitro and eradicates skin colonization.
AB  == background: antibiotic resistance among microbes urgently necessitates the development of novel antimicrobial agents. since ancient times, honey has been used successfully for treatment of infected wounds, because of its antibacterial  activity. however, large variations in the in vitro antibacterial activity of various honeys have been reported and hamper its acceptance in modern medicine. methods: we assessed the in vitro bactericidal activity of revamil (bfactory), a  medical-grade honey produced under controlled conditions, and assessed its efficacy for reduction of forearm skin colonization in healthy volunteers in a within-subject-controlled trial. results: with bacillus subtilis as a test strain, we demonstrated that the variation in bactericidal activity of 11 batches of medical-grade honey was <2-fold. antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant isolates of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, and klebsiella oxytoca were killed within 24 h by 10%-40% (vol/vol) honey. after 2 days of application of honey, the extent of forearm skin colonization in healthy  volunteers was reduced 100-fold (p < .001), and the numbers of positive skin cultures were reduced by 76% (p < .001). conclusions: revamil is a promising topical antimicrobial agent for prevention or treatment of infections, including  those caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == prevalence of plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamases in a chinese university hospital from 2003 to 2005: first report of cmy-2-type ampc beta-lactamase resistance in china.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the prevalences of plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamases (pabls) in isolates of escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. from  a university hospital in china. a total of 1,935 consecutive nonrepeat clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and klebsiella oxytoca were  collected between january 2003 and july 2005. the isolates with cefoxitin zone diameters less than 18 mm (screen positive) were selected for pcr of the bla(ampc) genes and sequencing. fifty-four (2.79%) isolates harbored pabls, as demonstrated by pcr and isoelectric focusing. sequence analysis revealed the presence of bla(dha-1) and bla(cmy-2) genes. the southern blot hybridization studies confirmed that bla(cmy-2) and bla(dha-1) were located on plasmids. based  on species, pabls were detected in 4.29% (29 isolates of dha-1 and 1 isolate of cmy-2) of k. pneumoniae, 1.91% (11 isolates of dha-1 and 12 isolates of cmy-2) of e. coli, and 3.03% (1 isolate of dha-1) of k. oxytoca isolates. in contrast to our anticipation, the occurrence rate of dha-1-producing k. pneumonia significantly decreased (p < 0.01), from 7.54% in 2003 to 2.72% in 2004. the results of random amplified polymorphic dna analysis indicate that the prevalences of dha-1-producing k. pneumoniae and cmy-2-producing e. coli strains  were not due to epidemic strains. in conclusion, dha-1 was the most prevalent acquired ampc beta-lactamase in this collection of isolates from a medical center in china, and dha-1-producing k. pneumoniae was the most prevalent bacterium harboring a pabl. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of cmy-2-type ampc beta-lactamases in the chinese mainland.

TI  == performance of chromid esbl, a chromogenic medium for detection of enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  == the chromogenic agar medium chromid esbl (biomerieux) was compared with blse agar medium (aes) for selective isolation and presumptive identification of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae from clinical samples. a total of 765 samples (468 rectal swabs, 255 urine samples and 42 pulmonary aspirations) obtained from 547 patients was processed. all bacterial strains isolated on either medium were further characterized using biochemical tests, and esbl producers were confirmed by synergy testing. genetic characterization of esbl genes was determined by pcr. a total of 33 esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae strains [escherichia coli (n=16), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=8), enterobacter spp. (n=3), citrobacter spp. (n=5) and proteus mirabilis (n=1)] was recovered. the sensitivity after 24 h incubation was 88 % for chromid esbl and 85 % for blse agar. at 48 h, the sensitivity of chromid esbl increased to 94 % and was higher than that obtained with blse agar. the positive  predictive value at 24 h for chromid esbl was 38.7 % [95 % confidence interval (95 % ci) 28.3 -50.2 %)], which was significantly higher than that for blse agar  [15.4 %, 95 % ci 10.1 -21.5 %]. on both media, false-positive results were mostly due to pseudomonas aeruginosa and to enterobacteriaceae overproducing chromosomal cephalosporinase (enterobacter spp.) or a chromosomal penicillinase (klebsiella oxytoca). this study showed that chromid esbl, a ready-to-use chromogenic selective medium, is sensitive and specific for rapid, presumptive identification of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae. its chromogenic properties and its selectivity are particularly useful in specimens containing resident associated flora.

TI  == histidine-alpha143 assists 1,2-hydroxyl group migration and protects radical intermediates in coenzyme b12-dependent diol dehydratase.
AB  == diol dehydratase of klebsiella oxytoca contains an essential histidine residue. its x-ray structure revealed that the migrating hydroxyl group on c2 of substrate is hydrogen-bonded to hisalpha143. mutant enzymes in which hisalpha143 was mutated to another amino acid residue were expressed in escherichia coli, purified, and examined for enzymatic activity. the halpha143q mutant was 34% as active as the wild-type enzyme. halpha143a and halpha143l showed only a trace of  activity. kinetic analyses indicated that the hydrogen bonding interaction between the hydroxyl group on c2 of substrate and the side chain of residue alpha143 is important not only for catalysis but also for protecting radical intermediates. halpha143e and halpha143k that did not exist as (alphabetagamma) 2 complexes were inactive. the deuterium kinetic isotope effect on the overall reaction suggested that a hydrogen abstraction step is fully rate-determining for the wild type and halpha143q and partially rate-determining for halpha143a. the preference for substrate enantiomers was reversed by the halpha143q mutation in both substrate binding and catalysis. upon the inactivation of the halpha143a holoenzyme by 1,2-propanediol, cob(ii)alamin without an organic radical coupling  partner accumulated, 5'-deoxyadenosine was quantitatively formed from the coenzyme adenosyl group, and the apoenzyme itself was not damaged. this inactivation was thus concluded to be a mechanism-based inactivation. the holoenzyme of halpha143q underwent irreversible inactivation by o 2 in the absence of substrate at a much lower rate than the wild type.

TI  == susceptibility of bacterial isolates from turkey--a report from the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection (mystic) program.
AB  == the study monitored the susceptibility of nosocomial pathogens to meropenem and comparator antimicrobial agents isolated as part of the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection (mystic) program from turkish university hospitals. in terms of minimum inhibitory concentration 90% (mic(90))  values, meropenem was two- and eight-fold more active than imipenem against escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, respectively. 40.5% of k. pneumoniae, 23.1% of klebsiella oxytoca and 15.3% of e. coli isolates were extended-spectrum  beta-lactamase (esbl) producers. piperacillin/tazobactam was the most active agent against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, followed by meropenem and imipenem. against acinetobacter baumannii isolates, meropenem and imipenem were the most active agents. continued surveillance by the mystic program appears to be prudent to help focus on effective empiric treatment regimens.

TI  == linkage of acquired quinolone resistance (qnrs1) and metallo-beta-lactamase (blavim-1) genes in multiple species of enterobacteriaceae from bolzano, italy.
AB  == objectives: twenty-four of 209 oxyimino-cephalosporin- and/or aztreonam-resistant enterobacteriaceae collected around bolzano had reduced susceptibility or resistance to carbapenems and gave positive metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl) tests. their resistance mechanisms were investigated. methods: resistances were identified by vitek 2 and mic tests and isolates were genotyped by pfge. resistance genes were identified by pcr and sequencing, and plasmids were transferred by conjugation and/or transformation. plasmid-borne genes were identified by southern blotting, and their genetic surroundings were investigated by pcr mapping. results: the 24 isolates with positive edta/imipenem synergy tests had bla(vim-1) carried on 40-150 kb plasmids. imipenem mics ranged from 2 to >32 mg/l, while those of meropenem and ertapenem were lower. the isolates included a clonal cluster of 10 klebsiella pneumoniae, two other k. pneumoniae isolates, and diverse isolates of escherichia coli (seven), klebsiella oxytoca (three) and citrobacter freundii (two). six mbl producers were aztreonam-susceptible; the 18 aztreonam-resistant isolates had co-resident extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. bla(vim-1) occurred as the first cassette in class 1 integrons, with aaca4 as the second cassette. quinolone resistance gene qnrs1 was detected in 21 of 24 (87.5%) bla(vim-1)-positive isolates versus 14 of  185 (7.6%) bla(vim)-negative isolates (p < 0.0001), with 13 of the latter belonging to a clonal cluster of e. coli. qnrs1 was located on the same plasmids  as bla(vim-1) and aaca4, but was not closely linked, as judged by pcr mapping. conclusions: bla(vim-1) has become disseminated among enterobacteria in a small italian town. the frequent association of genes conferring carbapenem, aminoglycoside and quinolone resistance on single plasmids will facilitate co-selection.

TI  == identification of the 4-hydroxycinnamate decarboxylase (pad) gene of klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  == a 7.1-kbp dna fragment isolated from a wild strain of klebsiella oxytoca was sequenced, leading to the identification of 10 open-reading frames (orfs), including a 504-bp pad gene. the pad gene of the gram-negative bacterium was subsequently expressed in escherichia coli as a chimeric pad. the deduced amino acid (aa) sequence of the pad gene from wild-type k. oxytoca showed approximately 50% homology to those of other bacterial pads from gram-positive bacilli plus a coccus. these data and a genomic library search of some gamma-proteobacteria, including e. coli and vibrio sp., indicated that pad of k. oxytoca is a member of the bacterial pad family characteristic of gram-negative bacteria. using pad-specific pcr primers designed from the gram-negative bacterial pad of k. oxytoca, pad genes of two further strains of k. oxytoca, another wild isolate and jcm 1665 and two pad-positive enterobacter spp. were successfully amplified for specific pad detection.

TI  == [prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in nosocomial escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. strains isolated from blood cultures].
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in nosocomial bacteremia isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca at hacettepe university adult hospital in ankara, turkey. a total of 344 blood culture isolates of e. coli (n=244), k. pneumoniae (n=86) and k. oxytoca (n=34) were included in the study from january 2003 to november 2005. only one isolate from one patient was tested  in the study. the isolates with ceftazidime and/or cefotaxime mic values > or =1  microg/ml were tested by ceftazidime-ceftazidime/clavulanic acid and cefotaxime-cefotaxime/clavulanic acid etest (ab biodisk solna, sweden) strips and evaluated as esbl positive if the ratio was > or =8. of the isolates, 33% (74/224) of e. coli, 31.4% (27/86) of k. pneumoniae and 47% (16/34) of k. oxytoca were detected as esbl producers by any kind of two strips. however, 5.4% (4/74) of e. coli, 3.7% (1/27) of k. pneumoniae and 43.1% (7/16) of k. oxytoca esbl-producing isolates could be detected only by cefotaxime-cefotaxime/clavulanic acid strips. it is important to use cefotaxime-cefotaxime/clavulanic acid as well as ceftazidime-ceftazidime/clavulanic acid ratio for detection of esbl types that preferentially hydrolyze cefotaxime. since prevalence of esbl production is high  in nosocomial e. coli and klebsiella spp. isolates in our hospital, surveillance  of antibiotic susceptibility patterns is important for the empirical treatment of bacteremic patients.

TI  == identification of type 3 fimbriae in uropathogenic escherichia coli reveals a role in biofilm formation.
AB  == catheter-associated urinary tract infection (cauti) is the most common nosocomial infection in the united states. uropathogenic escherichia coli (upec), the most common cause of cauti, can form biofilms on indwelling catheters. here, we identify and characterize novel factors that affect biofilm formation by upec strains that cause cauti. sixty-five cauti upec isolates were characterized for phenotypic markers of urovirulence, including agglutination and biofilm formation. one isolate, e. coli ms2027, was uniquely proficient at biofilm growth despite the absence of adhesins known to promote this phenotype. mini-tn5 mutagenesis of e. coli ms2027 identified several mutants with altered biofilm growth. mutants containing insertions in genes involved in o antigen synthesis (rmlc and manb) and capsule synthesis (kpsm) possessed enhanced biofilm phenotypes. three independent mutants deficient in biofilm growth contained an insertion in a gene locus homologous to the type 3 chaperone-usher class fimbrial genes of klebsiella pneumoniae. these type 3 fimbrial genes (mrkabcdf), which were located on a conjugative plasmid, were cloned from e. coli ms2027 and could  complement the biofilm-deficient transconjugants when reintroduced on a plasmid.  primers targeting the mrkb chaperone-encoding gene revealed its presence in cauti strains of citrobacter koseri, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, and klebsiella oxytoca. all of these mrkb-positive strains caused type 3 fimbria-specific agglutination of tannic acid-treated red blood cells. this is the first description of type 3 fimbriae in e. coli, c. koseri, and c. freundii.  our data suggest that type 3 fimbriae may contribute to biofilm formation by different gram-negative nosocomial pathogens.

AB  == background: we report the emergence and spread of metallo-beta-lactamases (mbls)  among enterobacterial isolates at ramon y cajal university hospital (madrid, spain). methods and results: during the period from march 2005 through september  2006, 25 patients (52% of whom were in the intensive care unit) were infected and/or colonized with single or different mbl-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates (klebsiella pneumoniae, 14 patients; enterobacter cloacae, 12 patients;  escherichia coli, 1 patient; and/or klebsiella oxytoca, 1 patient). clonal analysis (xbai pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) revealed that all k. pneumoniae  isolates belonged to the same clone, but 6 patterns were found among the e. cloacae isolates. carbapenems were affected to different degrees (minimum inhibitory concentration, < or = 1 to > 8 microg/ml), as were aminoglycosides and ciprofloxacin. the bla(vim-1) mbl gene was present in all isolates; in addition,  the bla(shv-12) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene was detected in k. pneumoniae and e. coli isolates. the bla(vim-1) gene was detected within a 4.0-kb class 1 integron (bla(vim-1)-aaca4-dfrii-aada1-catb2) in k. pneumoniae and e. coli and in a 2.5-kb class 1 integron (bla(vim-1)-aaca4-aada1) in e. cloacae and  k. oxytoca isolates. the bla(vim-1) gene was transferable (filter-mating) in 14 of 14 k. pneumoniae isolates, 4 of 11 e. cloacae isolates, and 1 of 1 e. coli isolate. a 60-kb plasmid belonging to the inci1 group was detected in the epidemic vim-1-k. pneumoniae clone. plasmids of 300- or 435-kb belonging to inch12 group were found among e. cloacae isolates. conclusions: k. pneumoniae-mbl monoclonal epidemics coexisted with e. cloacae-mbl multiclonal epidemics in our hospital. the spread of the bla(vim-1) gene among enterobacteriaceae was driven by clonal spread associated with intergeneric plasmid transfer with different class i integron platforms. such complex epidemiology might anticipate endemicity and should be considered for the design of containment epidemiology strategies.

TI  == interplay between the temperate phages py54 and n15, linear plasmid prophages with covalently closed ends.
AB  == the objective of this study was to determine whether the temperate yersinia enterocolitica phage py54 may interact with the related escherichia coli phage n15 during both the lysogenic and the lytic cycle in the same cell. the py54 and  n15 prophages are linear plasmids which have been shown to be compatible and stably replicating in e. coli and yersinia. in e. coli, the py54 prophage does not restrict n15 propagation. in contrast, n15 reduces by use of its cor gene the susceptibility of yersinia strains to py54. doubly lysogenic e. coli strains release py54 virions, some of which apparently contain the n15 genome. further experiments with replicative miniplasmid derivatives of py54, n15, and the related klebsiella oxytoca phage phiko2 demonstrated that the phiko2 and n15 plasmid prophages belong to the same incompatibility group.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative bacilli causing infections in intensive care unit patients in the united states between 1993 and 2004.
AB  == during the 12-year period from 1993 to 2004, antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of 74,394 gram-negative bacillus isolates recovered from intensive care  unit (icu) patients in united states hospitals were determined by participating hospitals and collected in a central location. mics for 12 different agents were  determined using a standardized broth microdilution method. the 11 organisms most frequently isolated were pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.2%), escherichia coli (18.8%), klebsiella pneumoniae (14.2%), enterobacter cloacae (9.1%), acinetobacter spp. (6.2%), serratia marcescens (5.5%), enterobacter aerogenes (4.4%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4.3%), proteus mirabilis (4.0%), klebsiella oxytoca (2.7%), and citrobacter freundii (2.0%). specimen sources included the lower respiratory tract (52.1%), urine (17.3%), and blood (14.2%). rates of resistance to many of the antibiotics tested remained stable during the 12-year study period. carbapenems were the most active drugs tested against most of the bacterial species. e. coli and p. mirabilis remained susceptible to most of the drugs tested. mean rates of resistance to 9 of the 12 drugs tested increased with acinetobacter spp. rates of resistance to ciprofloxacin increased over the study  period for most species. ceftazidime was the only agent to which a number of species (acinetobacter spp., c. freundii, e. aerogenes, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, and s. marcescens) became more susceptible. the prevalence of multidrug resistance, defined as resistance to at least one extended-spectrum cephalosporin, one aminoglycoside, and ciprofloxacin, increased substantially among icu isolates of acinetobacter spp., p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. cloacae.

TI  == photoactivated ethidium monoazide directly cleaves bacterial dna and is applied to pcr for discrimination of live and dead bacteria.
AB  == ethidium monoazide (ema) is a dna intercalating agent and a eukaryotic topoisomerase ii poison. we found that ema treatment and subsequent visible light irradiation (photoactivation or photolysis) shows a bactericidal effect, hence the mechanism was analyzed. when bacterial cells were treated with more than 10 microg/ml of ema for 1 hr plus photoactivation for 20 min, cleavage of bacterial  dna was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis and electron microscopic studies. the cleavage of chromosomal dna was seen when it was treated in vitro with ema and photolysis, which showed that the cleavage directly took place without the assistance of dna gyrase/topoisomerase iv and the dna repair enzymes  of bacteria. it was also verified, by using negatively supercoiled pbr322 dna, that medium/high concentrations of ema (1 to 100 microg/ml) led to breaks of double-stranded dna and that low concentrations of ema (10 to 100 ng/ml) generated a single-stranded break. ema is known to easily penetrate dead but not  live bacteria. after treatment of 10 microg/ml of ema for 30 min and photoactivation for 5 min, ema cleaved the dna of dead but not live klebsiella oxytoca. when the cleaved dna was used for templates in pcr targeting 16s rdna, pcr product from the dead bacteria was completely suppressed. we demonstrated that ema and photolysis directly cleaved bacterial dna and are effective tools for discriminating live from dead bacteria by pcr.

TI  == development of ethanologenic bacteria.
AB  == the utilization of lignocellulosic biomass as a petroleum alternative faces many  challenges. this work reviews recent progress in the engineering of escherichia coli and klebsiella oxytoca to produce ethanol from biomass with minimal nutritional supplementation. a combination of directed engineering and metabolic  evolution has resulted in microbial biocatalysts that produce up to 45 g l(-1) ethanol in 48 h in a simple mineral salts medium, and convert various lignocellulosic materials to ethanol. mutations contributing to ethanologenesis are discussed. the ethanologenic biocatalyst design approach was applied to other commodity chemicals, including optically pure d: (-)- and l: (+)-lactic acid, succinate and l: -alanine with similar success. this review also describes recent progress in growth medium development, the reduction of hemicellulose hydrolysate toxicity and reduction of the demand for fungal cellulases.

TI  == construction and characterization of hybrid dehydratases between adenosylcobalamin-dependent diol and glycerol dehydratases.
AB  == adenosylcobalamin-dependent diol dehydratase and glycerol dehydratase are isofunctional enzymes that catalyze the dehydration of 1,2-diols to the corresponding aldehydes. although they bear different metabolic roles, both enzymes consist of three different subunits and possess a common (alphabetagamma)2 structure. to elucidate the roles of each subunit, we constructed expression plasmids for the hybrid dehydratases between diol dehydratase of klebsiella oxytoca and glycerol dehydratase of klebsiella pneumoniae in all the combinations of subunits by gene engineering techniques. all of the hybrid enzymes were produced in escherichia coli at high levels, but only two hybrid enzymes consisting of the alpha subunit from glycerol dehydratase and the beta subunits from diol dehydratase showed high activity. the substrate specificity, the susceptibility to inactivation by glycerol, and the monovalent cation specificity of the wild type and hybrid enzymes were primarily determined  by the origin of their alpha subunits.

TI  == comparison of phoenix and vitek 2 extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase detection tests for analysis of escherichia coli and klebsiella isolates with well-characterized beta-lactamases.
AB  == the vitek 2 and phoenix extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) detection systems, which comprise confirmatory tests and expert systems, were evaluated for their ability to discriminate between 102 well-characterized strains of esbl-positive or -negative escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and klebsiella oxytoca. at least 38 distinct esbls were included. the strains were chosen to include some known to cause false-positive and false-negative clsi esbl confirmatory test results. therefore, enzyme characterizations, rather than clsi  tests, were the reference methods for the phoenix and vitek 2 evaluations. a third arm of the study was conducted with the phoenix test using two normally inactive expert rules intended to enhance esbl detection, in addition to using the currently available software. the phoenix esbl confirmatory test and unmodified expert system exhibited 96% sensitivity and 81% specificity for esbl detection. activation of the two additional rules increased sensitivity to 99% but reduced the specificity to 58%. the vitek 2 esbl confirmatory test exhibited  91% sensitivity, which was reduced to 89% sensitivity by its expert system, while its specificity was 85%. many of the expert system interpretations of both instruments were helpful, but some were suboptimal. the vitek 2 expert system was potentially more frustrating because it provided more inconclusive interpretations of the results. considering the high degree of diagnostic difficulty posed by the strains, both esbl confirmatory tests were highly sensitive. the expert systems of both instruments require modification to update  and enhance their utility.

TI  == dissemination and persistence of a plasmid-mediated tem-3-like beta-lactamase, tem-139, among enterobacteriaceae in bulgaria.
AB  == during a survey of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in bulgaria from 1996 to 2003, a tem-3-like esbl was detected in strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii and klebsiella oxytoca from three centres  in three different towns. the nucleotide sequence of the cloned gene was identical to that of tem-3, except for one substitution (c347a) causing an amino  acid exchange at position 49 from leucine to methionine. this tem-3 variant with  both a unique nucleotide and amino acid sequence was designated tem-139. transformants producing tem-3 or tem-139 expressed identical beta-lactam resistance phenotypes. tem-139 was the only tem-type esbl detected in the surveyed hospitals (seven centres in three towns). tem-139 is a natural variant of tem-3 with an amino acid exchange without informational content, detectable only by molecular procedures, e.g. a nucleotide-specific polymerase chain reaction.

TI  == characterization of bacterial coliform occurrences in different zones of a drinking water distribution system.
AB  == aims: to compare the bacterial coliforms detected from occurrences in three zones of a water distribution system supplied by two separate water sources. methods and results: conventional and standardized protocols for identifying enterobacterial populations were applied. additional tests to confirm isolates were included. analyses of diversity and population similarity were performed using the phene plate system, a miniaturized biochemical phenotyping method. isolates were identified by the api 20e system in tandem with biochemical phenotyping. a total of 16 576 samples were taken from the water distribution system, with 1416 isolates analysed. a low number of coliform occurrences were observed (2%). escherichia coli was not detected in either water origin or in zone 2 samples; however, in zones 1 and 3 a low number of cases of e. coli were recorded. the percentages of e. coli depended on the identification criteria. eight biochemical profiles for coliform populations were defined according to the results of the confirmative tests. there was a high diversity among these populations in the three zones studied, although no significant variations in their composition (associated with occurrences in the different zones) were observed. klebsiella oxytoca was the most commonly detected species irrespective  of zone, although seven other enterobacterial genera were also found. conclusions: analysis of the enzymatic activity of beta-glucuronidase or application of the criteria established in the norm iso 9308-1, in tandem with thermotolerance was needed to evaluate the occurrence of e. coli in the distribution systems. detected occurrences of bacterial coliforms could be associated with re-growth patterns for specific sampling points in the distribution system. seasonal differences, independent of the studied zones, were observed. significance and impact of the study: biochemical phenotyping of bacterial coliforms was shown to be a useful method on the characterization of occurrences in water distribution systems.

TI  == detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae by use of semiautomated microbiology systems and manual detection procedures.
AB  == three commercially available microbiology identification and susceptibility testing systems were compared with regard to their ability to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production in enterobacteriaceae, i.e., the phoenix automated microbiology system (bd diagnostic systems, sparks, md), the vitek 2 system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france), and the microscan walkaway-96 system (dade behring, inc., west sacramento, ca), using routine testing panels. one hundred fifty putative esbl producers were distributed blindly to three participating laboratories. conventional phenotypic confirmatory tests such as the disk approximation method, the clsi double-disk synergy test, and the etest esbl were also evaluated. biochemical and molecular characterization of beta-lactamases performed at an independent laboratory was used as the reference method. one hundred forty-seven isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii were investigated. of these  isolates, 85 were identified as esbl producers by the reference method. the remaining isolates were identified as non-esbl producers; they were either hyperproducers of their chromosomal ampc, koxy, or shv enzymes or lacked any detectable beta-lactamase activity. the system with the highest sensitivity for the detection of esbls was the phoenix (99%), followed by the vitek 2 (86%) and the microscan (84%); however, specificity was more variable, ranging from 52% (phoenix) to 78% (vitek 2). the performance of the semiautomated systems differed widely with the species investigated. the sensitivities of the conventional test  methods ranged from 93 to 94%. the double-disk synergy test showed the highest specificity and positive predictive value among all test methods, i.e., 97% and 98%, respectively.

TI  == evaluation of a new selective chromogenic agar medium for detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == a novel chromogenic agar medium (esbl-bx; biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) was compared to macconkey agar supplemented with 2 mg ceftazidime/liter (mckc) for the selective isolation and presumptive identification of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae directly from clinical samples. of a total of 644 clinical specimens (including 551 fecal samples), 496  yielded no growth and 148 yielded growth on one or both media. overall, 44 esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae strains (escherichia coli [n=17], enterobacter  aerogenes [n=17], klebsiella spp. [n=5], and citrobacter freundii [n=5]) were isolated from 37 specimens by a combination of both methods after 18 to 24 h of incubation. the sensitivities were 97.7 and 84.1% for esbl-bx and mckc, respectively, with 43 esbl-positive strains isolated as colored colonies from 36  specimens on esbl-bx versus 37 esbl-positive organisms isolated from 32 specimens on mckc. the specificities by specimens were 89 and 91% for esbl-bx and mckc, respectively. on either one of the two media, natural ampc-hyperproducing enterobacter spp. (n=25) and citrobacter spp. (n=14) were the most common false positives as well as non-esbl-producing klebsiella oxytoca (n=18) on esbl-bx and  morganella morganii (n=10) on mckc. we conclude that esbl-bx is a sensitive and specific medium for the isolation of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae from clinical samples. the main advantages of esbl-bx over mckc reside in its chromogenic character and its sensitivity and selectivity, which enabled the recovery and presumptive identification of most esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae within 24 h and reduced by 27% the need for unnecessary identification and confirmation of esbl testing when disregarding all colorless colonies growing on  this medium.

TI  == signal recognition particle-dependent inner membrane targeting of the pulg pseudopilin component of a type ii secretion system.
AB  == the pseudopilin pulg is an essential component of the pullulanase-specific type ii secretion system from klebsiella oxytoca. pulg is the major subunit of a short, thin-filament pseudopilus, which presumably elongates and retracts in the  periplasm, acting as a dynamic piston to promote pullulanase secretion. it has a  signal sequence-like n-terminal segment that, according to studies with green and red fluorescent protein chimeras, anchors unassembled pulg in the inner membrane. we analyzed the early steps of pulg inner membrane targeting and insertion in escherichia coli derivatives defective in different protein targeting and export  factors. the beta-galactosidase activity in strains producing a pulg-lacz hybrid  protein increased substantially when the dsba, dsbb, or all sec genes tested except secb were compromised by mutations. to facilitate analysis of native pulg  membrane insertion, a leader peptidase cleavage site was engineered downstream from the n-terminal transmembrane segment (prepulg*). unprocessed prepulg* was detected in strains carrying mutations in seca, secy, sece, and secd genes, including some novel alleles of secy and secd. furthermore, depletion of the ffh  component of the signal recognition particle (srp) completely abolished prepulg*  processing, without affecting the sec-dependent export of periplasmic male and rbsb proteins. thus, pulg is cotranslationally targeted to the inner membrane sec translocase by srp.

AB  == the aim of the present study was to assess the occurrence and molecular diversity of beta-lactamase genes and integrons among gram-negative ampicillin-resistant bacteria from ria de aveiro. ampicillin-resistant isolates were selected and subjected to genotyping using rep-pcr. representatives from each rep pattern were affiliated with the following taxa by sequencing the 16s rrna gene: aeromonas caviae, a. hydrophila, a. media, a. molluscorum, a. veronii, a. salmonicida, aeromonas sp., pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas sp., escherichia coli, escherichia sp., shigella sonnei, shigella sp., klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, r. planticola, citrobacter freundii, morganella morganii and enterobacter sp. isolates affiliated with genera escherichia or shigella were identified as escherichia coli using phenotypic-based tests. pcr was used to assess beta-lactamase encoding sequences (bla(tem), bla(shv), bla(carb), bla(ctx-m), bla(imp), bla(vim), bla(cpha/imis), bla(oxa-a), bla(oxa-b), bla(oxa-c)), class 1 and class 2 integrases, and integron variable regions. sequence analysis of pcr products was performed. beta-lactamase genes were detected in 77.8% of the enterobacteriaceae and in 10.5% of the aeromonas. the most frequently detected gene was bla(tem), followed by bla(shv,)bla(oxa-b),  bla(cpha/imis) and bla(carb). retrieved sequences shared high homology with previously described beta-lactamases. the inti1 gene was present in 29.6% of the  enterobacteriaceae and in 21% of the aeromonas isolates. the inti2 gene was present in 4 isolates. a total of 13 cassettes included in 12 different cassette  arrays were identified. the most frequently found resistance gene cassettes were  aada variants. previous investigations based on cultivation-independent approaches revealed higher molecular diversity among beta-lactamase-encoding sequences in this estuary. this fact reinforces the hypothesis that cultivation-dependent approaches may underestimate the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes in environmental samples and may introduce bias in the recovery  of their molecular variants.

TI  == [development of beta-lactamase resistance in enterobacteria].
AB  == enterobacteria produce elementary chromosomal enzymes, beta-lactamases of class a: tem and shv (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae). these can give rise to  plasmid-coded broad-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) discovered in 1980 (e. coli,  k. pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae). the first cefotaximase (ctx-m, men-1) was reported in europe in 1990. this enzyme is far more active against cefotaxime than against ceftazidime and aztreonam. chromosomal hyperpoduction of k1 beta-lactamase differs from all other esbls due its sensitivity to ceftazidime (klebsiella oxytoca). however, not all enterobacteria are resistant only because  of esbls, but also as a result of the action of chromosomally or plasmid coded ampc beta-lactamase of class c (mir-1, cmy-1, bil-1, fox-1, mox-1, dha-1, acc-1), resistant to beta-lactamase inhibitors and to cefoxitin (enterobacter spp., proteus vulgaris, citrobacter freundii, morganelle spp., serratia spp.). with the loss of outside-membrane porins (omp) they can become resistant to carbapenem an  tibiotics. the 100% resistance of enterobacteria to carbapenems that so far exists in this country is elsewhere in the world compromised by the incidence of  carbapenem-hydrolysing plasmid-determined beta-lactamase of class b (imp-1, vim-1) and of class a (kpc-1) in k. pneumoniae, (sme-1) in serratia marcescens and (imi-1, nmc-a) in e. clocae. carbapenemases in enterobacteria are only effective in the presence of impermeability and other resistance mechanisms.

TI  == bactericidal activity of ertapenem against major intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  == treatment of intra-abdominal infections remains a challenge owing to their polymicrobial nature and associated mortality risk. treatment regimens must provide broad-spectrum coverage, including gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. ertapenem is a long-acting 1-beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-daily dosing supported by clinical studies. it is active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. the aim of this study was to measure the killing effects of ertapenem against a selected group of strains responsible for intra-abdominal infections. gram-negative isolates comprised the following species: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella ozaenae, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers  and non-producers). gram-positive isolates comprised methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), enterococcus faecalis and anaerobic bacteroides fragilis. ertapenem activity was tested by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs). killing curves were performed in monocultures and co-cultures at selected antibiotic concentrations. ertapenem showed a rapid and potent bactericidal activity in the  first few hours of the kinetic curves against e. coli (6 log(10) colony-forming unit (cfu) reduction in the first 2h), b. fragilis (4 log(10) cfu reduction in 4h), mssa (3 log(10) cfu reduction in 4-6h), k. ozaenae (esbl+), k. pneumoniae (esbl+ and -), e. cloacae (esbl-) in 1h and p. mirabilis (esbl+) in the first 2h. the potent bactericidal activity of ertapenem compared with ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam was well demonstrated in the co-cultures of e. coli-b. fragilis and e. coli-b. fragilis-e. faecalis, whilst ertapenem was shown to be bactericidal at 24h in the mixed culture of s. aureus-p. mirabilis. these results support the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of ertapenem against all multiresistant strains selected in this study and the use of this drug in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

AB  == the performance of the bd phoenix automated microbiology system (bd diagnostic systems, sparks, md) was assessed for identification (id) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (ast) of the majority of clinically encountered bacterial  isolates in a european collaborative two-center trial. a total of 494 bacterial isolates including various species of the enterobacteriaceae and 110 nonfermentative gram-negative bacteria were investigated: of these, 385 were single patient isolates, and 109 were challenge strains tested at one center. the performance of the phoenix extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) test was also  evaluated for 203 strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and klebsiella oxytoca included in the study. forty-two antimicrobial drugs were tested, including members of the following drug classes: aminoglycosides, beta-lactam antibiotics, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors, carbapenems, cephems, monobactams, folate antagonists, quinolones, and others. phoenix system  id results were compared to those of the laboratories' routine id systems (api 20e and api che, atb id32e, id32gn, and vitek 2 [biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france]); phoenix ast results were compared to those of frozen standard broth microdilution (sbm) panels according to nccls (now clsi) guidelines (nccls document m100-s9, approved standard m7-a4). discrepant results were repeated in duplicate. concordant ids of 98.4 and 99.1% were observed for the enterobacteriaceae and the nonfermentative group, respectively. for ast results,  the overall essential agreement was 94.2%; the category agreement was 97.3%; and  the very major error rate, major error rate, and minor error rate were 1.6, 0.6,  and 1.9%, respectively. in terms of esbl detection, phoenix results were 98.5% concordant with those of the reference system, with 98.0% sensitivity and 98.7% specificity. in conclusion, the phoenix id results showed high agreement with results of the systems to which they were being compared: the ast performance was highly equivalent to that of the sbm reference method, and the system proved to be very accurate for the detection of esbl producers.

TI  == facs technology used in a new rapid bacterial detection method.
AB  == culture methods for bacterial detection (bact/alert or pall ebds) are currently implemented in blood donor screening procedures in many countries. experience in  the first years after implementation of these detection assays showed that although the analytical sensitivity was extremely high (about 1 cfu ml(-1)), the  majority of these platelets were still transfused before a positive screening result was attained. rapid technologies were developed to more effectively prevent transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection. in this study, a new rapid bacterial detection method based on fluorescence-activated cell sorting (facs) technology was developed. bacteria were stained with thiazole orange dye for 5 min and measurement was taken immediately after staining. the entire process took only 30 min. six transfusion-relevant bacteria strains were tested in a spiking study. without pre-incubation in a special bacteria growth medium, analytical sensitivity ranged between 10(5) cfu ml(-1) (klebsiella oxytoca and serratia marcesens) and 10(3) cfu ml(-1) (escherichia coli). sensitivity could be improved to 10(1) cfu ml(-1) for all tested bacteria by adding a pre-incubation step (6 h  at 37 degrees c). although preliminary in nature, results of our study suggest that bacterial detection by facs technology in conjunction with a pre-incubation  step offers a sensitive alternative technology to culture methods. additionally,  it provides the benefit of a rapid test time and the opportunity of preventing bacterial transmitted infections more effectively.

TI  == potential prophylactic value of bovine colostrum in necrotizing enterocolitis in  neonates: an in vitro study on bacterial attachment, antibody levels and cytokine production.
AB  == necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) is an important disease of low birth-weight neonates. the immaturity of the gut mucosa may result in close contact between the host epithelium and microorganisms which are normally confined to the gut lumen. damage of the mucosa due to endotoxin, cytokine production or other factors is believed to then occur. the aim of this study was to determine whether spray-dried bovine colostrum demonstrated potential in vitro as a prophylactic for nec. antiadherence was measured using a tissue culture assay and antibody levels against enterobacteriaceae were determined by elisa. the effect of bovine  colostrum on the production of cytokines implicated in nec was determined by a multiplex bead assay. enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens and klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae were common in both nec positive and nec negative infants and iga and igg1 antibodies to these species were present in the bovine colostrum. pretreatment with bovine colostrum  produced a significant decrease (p<0.001) in attachment of bacteria to ht-29 cells. bovine colostrum significantly increased the production of il-8 in ht-29 cells and il-8, il-6 and tnf-alpha in thp-1 cells (p<0.001). the potential of bovine colostrum to increase the production of inflammatory mediators could limit its usefulness.

TI  == faecal coliform bacteria in febros river (northwest portugal): temporal variation, correlation with water parameters, and species identification.
AB  == febros river water was sampled weekly, during 35 successive weeks, and analyzed for microbiological (total coliforms, faecal coliforms, faecal streptococci and enterococci) and chemical-physical (ammonia and temperature) parameters. all microbiological parameters were highly correlated with each other and with ammonia, suggesting that the simultaneous determination of all variables currently in use in the evaluation of the microbiological quality of waters is probably redundant, and could be simplified, and that ammonia should be tested as a sentinel parameter of the microbiological pollution load of febros river. from  the strains isolated from positive tubes of the faecal coliforms test (multiple tube fermentation technique) and retested in this assay, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca and klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae strains were positive, indicating that the faecal coliforms test is not totally specific for escherichia coli, and can detect other bacteria. considering that these klebsiella spp. are not necessarily of faecal origin, it was concluded that the faecal coliforms test can overestimate true faecal pollution. from the strains isolated from positive tubes of the faecal coliforms procedure, only escherichia  coli strains were clearly positive in the beta-d-glucuronidase test. all other species were negative or very weakly positive, suggesting that the assay of the beta-d-glucuronidase activity is less prone to false positives than the faecal coliforms test in the quantification of escherichia coli in environmental waters.

TI  == prevalence of enteric bacteria that inhibit growth of enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli o157 in humans.
AB  == enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli o157 (o157) is infectious to humans, particularly children, at very low doses and causes not only haemorrhagic colitis but also other serious symptoms. to investigate an association between intestinal bacterial flora and resistance to such infections, we screened faecal samples for the presence of enteric bacteria that are able to suppress the growth of o157. samples from 303 individuals, 35 children (aged < or =6 years) and 268 adults (aged 20-59 years), were examined. colonies with different appearances on sorbitol macconkey agar medium were screened for the production of bacteriocins inhibitory for o157 in an overlay agar plate assay. o157-inhibiting strains were  isolated from 52 individuals. the prevalence of these bacteria tended to rise with age, and was significantly higher among 40- to 59-year-old adults (23/101, 22.8%) than among children (3/35, 8.6%; p<0.05). to test the hypothesis that these bacteriocin-producing strains contribute to resistance against o157 in human adults, we examined faecal samples of 25 healthy o157 carriers. inhibitory  bacteria were more prevalent among the latter (9/25, 36.0%) than among age-matched subjects who did not carry o157 (49/268, 18.3%). it appears, therefore, that inhibitory bacteria in the human gut may play a role in inhibiting propagation of o157 and/or suppressing expression of virulence factors by this pathogen.

AB  == the antibiotic resistance surveillance project ar-iss, started in 2001, is based  on a network of 62 sentinel microbiological laboratories throughout the country.  the laboratories collect and transmit data to the istituto superiore di sanita on the antibiotic susceptibility of bloodstream isolates of 7 species: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis/faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca ed escherichia coli. they also send selected bacterial strains for further characterization. results of the first year of surveillance are presented and are compared with data from the previous study earss-italia and from other european countries. oxacillin resistance in s. aureus appears to be stable, however, it remains one of the highest in europe (41,5%). no strain with intermediate susceptibility or resistance to vancomycin has been isolated. in s. pneumoniae, the level of penicillin resistance is moderate (10,8%), but macrolide resistance has increased greatly (37,6% versus 28,6% of the previous study), following a tendency common to several european countries. unexpectedly, vancomycin resistance in e. faecium was found to be 18%, the highest in europe. presumptive esbl production in gram-negative organisms can be  estimated at 20% in klebsiella and 1% in e. coli. ampicillin and ciprofloxacin resistance in e. coli (respectively 50% and 18%) are among the highest in europe. in conclusion, the rate of antibiotic resistance in the species studied is worrisome and requires continuing monitoring. although some activities of ar-iss  need improvements, the surveillance has the potentiality to produce relevant and  representative data about antibiotic resistance in italy that can be used for comparison at the european level.

TI  == effects of chronic triclosan exposure upon the antimicrobial susceptibility of 40 ex-situ environmental and human isolates.
AB  == background: triclosan (tcs) exposure of escherichia coli selects for tolerant clones, mutated in their enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (fabi). it has been inferred that this phenomenon is widespread amongst bacterial genera and might be associated with resistance to third party agents. methods: ex-situ, low passage isolates of enteric, human axilla, human oral origin and bacteria isolated from a domestic drain, together with selected type cultures were exposed to escalating concentrations of tcs over 10 passages using a gradient plate technique. one fresh faecal isolate of e. coli was included as a positive control. tcs susceptibility was determined for all strains before and after exposure, whilst enteric isolates were additionally assessed for susceptibility towards chlorhexidine, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin, and the oral isolates towards chlorhexidine, tetracycline and metronidazole. results: triclosan exposure of e. coli markedly decreased tcs susceptibility. tcs susceptibility also decreased for klebsiella oxytoca, aranicola proteolyticus and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. susceptibility of the remaining 35 strains to tcs and the other test agents remained unchanged. conclusions: these data suggest that selection for high level resistance by tcs exposure is not widespread and appears to be confined to certain enteric bacteria, especially e. coli. change in tcs susceptibility did not affect susceptibility towards chemically unrelated antimicrobials. significance and impact: acquired high-level tcs resistance is not a widespread phenomenon.

TI  == green fluorescent chimeras indicate nonpolar localization of pullulanase secreton components pull and pulm.
AB  == the klebsiella oxytoca pullulanase secreton (type ii secretion system) components pulm and pull were tagged at their n termini with green fluorescent protein (gfp), and their subcellular location was examined by fluorescence microscopy and fractionation. when produced at moderate levels without other secreton components in escherichia coli, both chimeras were envelope associated, as are the native proteins. fluorescent gfp-pulm was evenly distributed over the cell envelope, with occasional brighter foci. under the same conditions, gfp-pull was barely detectable in the envelope by fluorescence microscopy. when produced together with all other secreton components, gfp-pull exhibited circumferential fluorescence, with numerous brighter patches. the envelope-associated fluorescence of gfp-pull was almost completely abolished when native pull was also produced, suggesting that the chimera cannot compete with pull for association with other secreton components. the patches of gfp-pull might represent functional secretons, since gfp-pulm also appeared in similar patches.  gfp-pulm and gfp-pull both appeared in spherical polar foci when made at high levels. in k. oxytoca, gfp-pulm was evenly distributed over the cell envelope, with few patches, whereas gfp-pull showed only weak envelope-associated fluorescence. these data suggest that, in contrast to their vibrio cholerae eps secreton counterparts (m. scott, z. dossani, and m. sandkvist, proc. natl. acad.  sci. usa 98:13978-13983, 2001), pulm and pull do not localize specifically to the cell poles and that the pul secreton is distributed over the cell surface.

AB  == two hundred and fifty-one unique patient isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae (123), escherichia coli (114), klebsiella oxytoca (7), enterobacter cloacae (5) and citrobacter freundii (2), flagged as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) positive by the vitek system (gns-526 card), were collected. these strains were isolated from a variety of clinical specimens submitted to the clinical bacteriology laboratories of the royal infirmary of edinburgh (rie), edinburgh, uk (and associated gp practices), hairmyers hospital, glasgow, uk, and the amiri  and farwania hospitals, kuwait. of the 101 rie strains tested, 15 e. coli strains were found to be esbl negative by etest esbl strips. on retesting the 15 e. coli  strains with the vitek gns-532 card, 14 were found to be esbl negative, despite being originally flagged as esbl positive. the remaining 236 esbl-producing strains were also subjected to the double disc-diffusion (ddd) technique for the  detection of esbls. of these, two were false negatives by etest esbl test strips  (using both cefotaxime and ceftazidime strips), and 38 were false negatives by the ddd method. the etest false-negative esbl-producing strains of k. pneumoniae  were positive by ddd. technically, the vitek method was the least demanding method to perform, as it was an integral part of the routine susceptibility test  card. etest strips were reliable, but were the most expensive of all the techniques used. the ddd test, while relatively inexpensive, was technically subjective, and in our hands, seven of the esbl-positive strains that were confirmed by the other two techniques were not detected. despite the false-positive esbl-producing e. coli strains, the vitek susceptibility card with its integral esbl test offers the clinical laboratory a valuable and quick option to screen for esbl-producing klebsiella spp. and e. coli as part of the routine laboratory methodology.

AB  == adenosylcobalamin (coenzyme b12) dependent diol dehydratase (ec 4.2.1.28) catalyzes the conversion of 1,2-diols and glycerol to the corresponding aldehydes. it undergoes mechanism-based inactivation by glycerol. the diol dehydratase-reactivating factor (ddr) reactivates the inactivated holoenzymes in  the presence of adenosylcobalamin, atp and mg2+ by mediating the release of a damaged cofactor. this molecular chaperone-like factor was overexpressed in escherichia coli, purified and crystallized in the adp-bound and nucleotide-free  forms by the sandwich-drop vapour-diffusion method. the crystals of the adp-bound form belong to the orthorhombic system, with space group p2(1)2(1)2(1) and unit-cell parameters a = 83.26, b = 84.60, c = 280.09 a, and diffract to 2.0 a. in the absence of nucleotide, ddr crystals were orthorhombic, with space group p2(1)2(1)2(1) and unit-cell parameters a = 81.92, b = 85.37, c = 296.99 a and diffract to 3.0 a. crystals of both forms were suitable for structural analysis.

AB  == for the post-marketing surveillance of cefmetazole (cmz, cefmetazon), mics of injectable beta-lactam antibacterials including cmz against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over japan are measured yearly and the incidence rates of resistance in various species are also evaluated. in the first surveillance from june 2000 to march 2001, 574 isolates of 13 species were tested, 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from april 2001 to march 2002, and 654 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the third surveillance from april 2002 to march 2003. no remarkable changes in the activity of cmz were observed in these surveillances spanning three years. the activity of cmz in this study was comparable to that in the studies conducted before cefmetazon was launched. this result suggests that cmz still maintains potent activity. changes in percent resistance of each species to cmz (mic of cmz > or = 32 microg/ml) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa, 0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa, 72.9% --> 87.2% --> 88.7%), staphylococcus epidermidis (18.5% --> 31.6% --> 14.3%), coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. (cns, 13.3% --> 18.2% --> 21.4%), escherichia coli (3.6% -->  0.8% --> 2.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3.4% --> 3.8% --> 2.1%), klebsiella oxytoca (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), proteus mirabilis (2.3% --> 2.1% --> 0.0%), proteus vulgaris (13.6% --> 6.7% --> 0.0%), morganella morganii (7.3% --> 0.0% --> 14.0%), providencia spp. (12.5% --> 0.0% --> 18.2%), peptostreptococcus spp.  (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), bacteroides fragilis (10.3% --> 10.8% --> 17.1%), bacteroides spp. (78.6% --> 87.5% --> 62.5%). the change in percent resistance of mrsa, other cns, and b. flagiris tended to increase. it is necessary to pay much  attention to trends observed in these species. compared to other drugs tested, against mssa, the activity of cmz was inferior to that of cez, ctm, and fmox and  superior to that sbt/cpz. against mrsa, s. epidermidis, and cns, the tested drugs exhibited little activity. against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and inferior to that of fmox. against b. flagiris and other bacteroides spp., the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and comparable to or inferior to that of sbt/cpz and fmox.

AB  == [omega-(adenosyl)alkyl]cobalamins (homoadenosylcobalamins) are useful analogues of adenosylcobalamin to get information about the distance between co and c5', which is critical for co-c bond activation. in order to use them as probes for exploring the active sites of enzymes, the coenzymic properties of homoadenosylcobalamins for diol dehydratase and ethanolamine ammonia-lyase were investigated. the kcat and kcat/km values for adenosylmethylcobalamin were about  0.27% and 0.15% that for the regular coenzyme with diol dehydratase, respectively. the kcat/kinact value showed that the holoenzyme with this analogue becomes inactivated on average after about 3000 catalytic turnovers, indicating that the probability of inactivation during catalysis is almost 500 times higher  than that for the regular holoenzyme. the kcat value for adenosylmethylcobalamin  was about 0.13% that of the regular coenzyme for ethanolamine ammonia-lyase, as judged from the initial velocity, but the holoenzyme with this analogue underwent inactivation after on average about 50 catalytic turnovers. this probability of inactivation is 3800 times higher than that for the regular holoenzyme. when estimated from the spectra of reacting holoenzymes, the steady state concentration of cob(ii)alamin intermediate from adenosylmethylcobalamin was very low with either diol dehydratase or ethanolamine ammonia-lyase, which is consistent with its extremely low coenzymic activity. in contrast, neither adenosylethylcobalamin nor adeninylpentylcobalamin served as active coenzyme for  either enzyme and did not undergo co-c bond cleavage upon binding to apoenzymes.

AB  == equid herpesvirus 1 (ehv1) is a major disease of equids worldwide causing considerable losses to the horse industry. a variety of techniques, including pcr have been used to diagnose ehv1. some of these pcrs were used in combination with other techniques such as restriction enzyme analysis (rea) or hybridisation, making them cumbersome for routine diagnostic testing and increasing the chances  of cross-contamination. furthermore, they involve the use of suspected carcinogens such as ethidium bromide and ultraviolet light. in this paper, we describe a real-time pcr, which uses minor groove-binding probe (mgb) technology  for the diagnosis of ehv1. this technique does not require post-pcr manipulations thereby reducing the risk of cross-contamination. most importantly, the technique is specific; it was able to differentiate ehv1 from the closely related member of the alphaherpesvirinae, equid herpesvirus 4 (ehv4). it was not reactive with common opportunistic pathogens such as escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter agglomerans often involved in abortion. similarly, it did not react with equine pathogens such as streptococcus equi, streptococcus equisimilis, streptococcus zooepidemicus, taylorella equigenitalis  and rhodococcus equi, which also cause abortion. the results obtained with this technique agreed with results from published pcr methods. the assay was sensitive enough to detect ehv1 sequences in paraffin-embedded tissues and clinical samples. when compared to virus isolation, the test was more sensitive. this test will be useful for the routine diagnosis of ehv1 based on its specificity, sensitivity, ease of performance and rapidity.

TI  == structural insights into the secretin puld and its trypsin-resistant core.
AB  == limited proteolysis, secondary structure and biochemical analyses, mass spectrometry, and mass measurements by scanning transmission electron microscopy  were combined with cryo-electron microscopy to generate a three-dimensional model of the homomultimeric complex formed by the outer membrane secretin puld, an essential channel-forming component of the type ii secretion system from klebsiella oxytoca. the complex is a dodecameric structure composed of two rings  that sandwich a closed disc. the two rings form chambers on either side of a central plug that is part of the middle disc. the puld polypeptide comprises two  major, structurally quite distinct domains; an n domain, which forms the walls of one of the chambers, and a trypsin-resistant c domain, which contributes to the outer chamber, the central disc, and the plug. the c domain contains a lower proportion of potentially transmembrane beta-structure than classical outer membrane proteins, suggesting that only a small part of it is embedded within the outer membrane. indeed, the c domain probably extends well beyond the confines of the outer membrane bilayer, forming a centrally plugged channel that penetrates both the peptidoglycan on the periplasmic side and the lipopolysaccharide and capsule layers on the cell surface. the inner chamber is proposed to constitute a docking site for the secreted exoprotein pullulanase, whereas the outer chamber could allow displacement of the plug to open the channel and permit the exoprotein to escape.

TI  == six groups of the oxy beta-lactamase evolved over millions of years in klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  == the diversity and evolution of the class a oxy beta-lactamase from klebsiella oxytoca were investigated and compared to housekeeping gene diversity. the entire bla(oxy) coding region was sequenced in 18 clinical isolates representative of the four k. oxytoca beta-lactamase gene groups bla(oxy-1) to bla(oxy-4) and of two new groups identified here, bla(oxy-5) (with four isolates with pi 7.2 and one with pi 7.7) and bla(oxy-6) (with four isolates with pi 7.75 and three with pi 8.1). genes bla(oxy-5) and bla(oxy-6) showed 99.8% within-group nucleotide similarity but differed from each other by 4.2% and from bla(oxy-1), their closest relative, by 2.5% and 2.9%, respectively. antimicrobial susceptibility to beta-lactams was similar among oxy groups. nucleotide sequence diversity of the 16s rrna (1,454 bp), rpob (940 bp), gyra (383 bp), and gapdh (573 bp) genes was in agreement with the beta-lactamase gene phylogeny. strains with bla(oxy-1), bla(oxy-2), bla(oxy-3), bla(oxy-4), and bla(oxy-6) genes formed five phylogenetic groups, named koi, koii, koiii, koiv, and kovi, respectively. isolates harboring  bla(oxy-5) appeared to represent an emerging lineage within koi. we estimated that the bla(oxy) gene has been evolving within k. oxytoca for approximately 100  million years, using as calibration the 140-million-year estimation of the escherichia coli-salmonella enterica split. these results show that the bla(oxy)  gene has diversified along k. oxytoca phylogenetic lines over long periods of time without concomitant evolution of the antimicrobial resistance phenotype.

TI  == acridine orange leukocyte cytospin test for central venous catheter--related bloodstream infection: a pediatric experience.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the acridine orange leukocyte cytospin (aolc) test for the rapid diagnosis of septicemia caused by central venous catheters (cvcs), without removing the catheter, in a pediatric intensive care unit population. twenty-six patients admitted in the pediatric intensive care unit of azienda ospedaliera "ospedali riuniti di bergamo", italy, were prospectively evaluated for cvc-related infection. blood for culture was taken from all patients. quantitative endoluminal cultures of the removed catheter tip  by cleri's technique and semiquantitative superficial cultures of the hub were performed. gram staining and an aolc smear were done according to kite's technique. four staphylococcus cvc-related bloodstream infections were identified. cvc colonization was detected in 8 patients. four had septicemia (enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, candida glabrata) without cvc involvement. however, gram staining and the aolc test were negative in all cases. we conclude that cytocentrifugation and acridine orange staining of blood withdrawn by kite's method from an in situ catheter, although simple, quick, and inexpensive, did not aid diagnosis in this pediatric population.

TI  == impact of inadequate initial antimicrobial therapy on mortality in infections due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae: variability by  site of infection.
AB  == background: infections due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella species (esbl-ek) have increased markedly in recent years. risk factors for mortality among esbl-ek infections have not been studied. methods: this retrospective cohort study was conducted in a 625-bed tertiary care medical center and a 344-bed urban community hospital to determine  whether inadequate initial antimicrobial therapy (iiat) (>48 hours between the time a culture was obtained and initiation of an agent to which the infecting organism was susceptible) is associated with mortality in esbl-ek infections. all hospitalized patients with an esbl-ek infection between june 1, 1997, and december 31, 2002, were eligible for inclusion. subsequently, we conducted a nested case-control study to identify risk factors for iiat. results: of 187 subjects, 32 (17.1%) died while in the hospital. clinical site of infection was a significant effect modifier in the association between iiat and mortality. the presence of iiat was an independent risk factor for mortality, but only for nonurinary esbl-ek infections (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 10.04 [1.90-52.96]). independent risk factors for iiat were (1) infection with a  multidrug-resistant esbl-ek (ie, resistant to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, aminoglycosides, and quinolones) (14.58 [1.91-111.36]) and (2) health care-acquired esbl-ek infection (4.32 [1.49-12.54]). conclusions: inadequate initial antimicrobial therapy is an independent risk factor for mortality in esbl-ek infections, but only among nonurinary infections. multidrug resistance was a strong risk factor for iiat.

TI  == gram-negative bacilli associated with catheter-associated and non-catheter-associated bloodstream infections and hand carriage by healthcare workers in neonatal intensive care units.
AB  == objective: bloodstream infections caused by gram-negative bacilli are a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality in infants in neonatal intensive care units. this study describes the species of gram-negative bacilli causing bloodstream infections in two neonatal intensive care units, compares characteristics of catheter-related and non-catheter-related bloodstream infections, and compares species and antibiotic resistance patterns of these organisms with those isolated from the hands of nurses working in the same neonatal intensive care units. design: interventional study. setting: two high-risk neonatal intensive care units. patients: neonates hospitalized for >or  =24 hrs. interventions: prospective surveillance for bloodstream infections was performed in two neonatal intensive care units from march 2001 to january 2003. hand cultures were obtained quarterly from participating nurses immediately after they performed hand hygiene. measurements and main results: there were 298 episodes of bloodstream infections among 2,935 admissions (5.75 episodes per 1,000 patient-days); 77 of 298 (26%) episodes were caused by gram-negative bacilli. among these, 47 (61.0%) were catheter-related bloodstream infections (2.61 episodes per 1,000 catheter-days). eleven and 24 gram-negative bacilli species were isolated from neonates and nurses, respectively. the most common gram-negative bacilli causing bloodstream infections were klebsiella pneumoniae (38.7%), escherichia coli (21.2%), enterobacter cloacae (11.2%), and serratia marcescens (11.2%). in contrast, acinetobacter lwoffi (18.1%), k. pneumoniae (11.7%), e. cloacae (10.6%), k. oxytoca (10.6%), and pseudomonas spp. (7.4%) were most commonly isolated from hands of nurses. e. coli, p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae,  and e. aerogenes were significantly more likely to cause bloodstream infections than to be isolated from nurses' hands (all p < .001). although 39% of bloodstream infections were non-catheter-related, there were no significant differences in types of organisms or antimicrobial resistance patterns between catheter-related bloodstream infections and non-catheter-related bloodstream infections (all p > or = .35). resistance patterns were similar between gram-negative bacilli isolates from neonates and nurses' hands except for a significantly higher proportion of resistance to cefotaxime and gentamicin among  neonatal isolates of k. pneumoniae (p < .05). conclusions: gram-negative bacilli  species isolated from neonatal bloodstream infections and nurses' hands varied significantly. clean hands of providers are an unlikely source of endemic gram-negative bacilli, suggesting that prevention strategies should focus more on control of endogenous neonatal flora or environmental sources.

TI  == major structural proteins of type 1 and type 3 klebsiella fimbriae are effective  protein carriers and immunogens in conjugates as revealed from their immunochemical characterization.
AB  == fimbriae are filamentous structures present on the cell surface of many bacteria, including genus klebsiella. the use of fimbriae as protein carriers in conjugates may allow to formulate effective multivalent vaccines and suitable diagnostics. however, the evidences have been reported that fimbriae may enhance the inflammatory response. this prompted us to examine the degree of cytokine induction by the type 1 and type 3 klebsiella fimbriae and their conjugates. fimbriae were assessed as carrier proteins for escherichia coli k12 endotoxin core oligosaccharide. maldi-ms revealed the molecular mass of fimbrial monomer major protein, which was 15,847 da for type 1 and 18,574 da for type 3 fimbriae of klebsiella. these two types of fimbriae were moderate inductors of il-6 and interferon and almost inactive with regard to the stimulation of tnf when tested  in human whole blood assay. coupling of fimbriae with e. coli k12 core oligosaccharide gave immunogenic conjugates with respect to a saccharide ligand and protein carrier, although only 10% of the pilin monomers possessed the attached oligosaccharide. rabbit antiserum reacted with a broad spectrum of lipopolysaccharides, as measured by elisa and immunoblotting assays. the antibodies against glycoconjugates were bactericidal for the wild, s-type bacteria of some species. regarding the induction of cytokines by conjugates only the tnf level was noticeably elevated. these results prompt for the practical use of fimbriae, as effective protein carriers for conjugates to obtain broad-spectrum antisera for diagnostic applications.

TI  == plasmid-mediated, inducible ampc beta-lactamase (dha-1)-producing enterobacteriaceae at a korean hospital: wide dissemination in klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca and emergence in proteus mirabilis.
AB  == the aim of the study was to investigate the phenotypic and genetic characteristics of recently emerging cefoxitin-resistant and induction-positive isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella species, and proteus mirabilis. strains  of enterobacteriaceae were isolated at a korean tertiary care hospital between june and december 2002. induction was tested using cefoxitin and aztreonam disks, the bladha allele was detected by pcr, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) patterns were also analyzed. among the cefoxitin-resistant isolates, 2.7%  of e. coli, 21.1% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 32.0% of klebsiella oxytoca, and 8.3% of p. mirabilis isolates showed induction, and were bladha-1 allele positive. to  the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of bladha-1 in p. mirabilis.  the mics of ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and aztreonam increased significantly by higher inoculum, suggesting that their clinical usefulness is limited. presence of multiple pfge patterns and identical patterns in some isolates suggest that the widely disseminated bladha-1 in klebsiella species was because of both horizontal and clonal spread.

TI  == laboratory tests in the detection of extended spectrum beta-lactamase production: national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) screening test, the  e-test, the double disk confirmatory test, and cefoxitin susceptibility testing.
AB  == extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production by klebsiella sp. and e. coli  is an emerging problem. in this study, 107 clinical isolates (53 e. coli, 47 k. pneumoniae and 7 k. oxytoca) screened as esbl producers by the nccls disk diffusion procedure were submitted to a double disk confirmatory test (ddt) and to the e-test double strip for confirmation of esbl production by demonstration of clavulanic acid inhibition effect (caie). only 72/107 (67%) of the isolates were confirmed as esbl producers by ddt, with diverse results among species. by the e-test, 58/107 (54%) isolates were confirmed as esbl producers, and 18/107 (17%) were not determinable. susceptibility to cefoxitin was found in 57/68 (83%) of strains that did not show caie. esbl detection remains a controversial issue and clinical laboratories are in need of a simple and effective way to recognize  strains with this kind of resistance.

TI  == role of pencillin binding proteins in pencillin allergy.
AB  == all beta-lactam sensitive bacteria contain enzymatic penicillin binding proteins  (pbps), which are membrane-bound enzymes and targets of beta-lactam antibiotics.  in this work evaluation of the significance of pbps in immune response to benzylpenicillin was presented. 35 patients with allergic reactions to penicillin and 17 subjects without penicillin allergy, but exposed, were studied. proliferative t-cell responses to benzylpenicillin, penicillin and pbps conjugates (pc-pbps) from e. coli, k. oxytoca, s. aureus, s. epidermidis or serum protein (pc-s) were measured. although each allergic individual responds to pc-pbps in several different ways, specific proliferation of t lymphocytes with pc-pbps from bacterial membranes was significant higher than with pc or pc-s. this observation gives us a real insight into the causes of the drug allergy: individual allergic reaction and susceptibility to the drug is in strict correlation with bacterial infection. it seems likely that acylation of pbps could be the trigger for primary immune response to the hapten benzylpenicillin.

TI  == the n-terminal regions of beta and gamma subunits lower the solubility of adenosylcobalamin-dependent diol dehydratase.
AB  == adenosylcobalamin-dependent diol dehydratase is one of essential components of carboxysome-like polyhedral bodies. it exists as a heterohexamer (alphabetagamma)(2), and its activity is recovered in a precipitant fraction of klebsiella oxytoca and overexpressing escherichia coli cells. limited proteolysis of the enzyme with trypsin converted the enzyme into a highly soluble form without loss of enzyme activity. the n-terminal amino acid sequencing of the enzyme thus solubilized indicated that the n-terminal 20 and 16 amino acid residues had been removed from the beta and gamma subunits, respectively. mutant  enzymes with the same n-terminal truncations of either or both of the beta and gamma subunits were expressed on a high level in e. coli cells. all the mutant enzymes obtained were expressed in a soluble, active form. these results indicate that the n-terminal regions of the beta and gamma subunits lower the solubility of diol dehydratase. the mutant enzyme with the n-terminal truncations of both beta and gamma subunits was essentially indistinguishable in catalytic properties from recombinant wild-type enzyme or the enzyme purified from k. oxytoca in a soluble form.

TI  == rapid, species-specific detection of uropathogen 16s rdna and rrna at ambient temperature by dot-blot hybridization and an electrochemical sensor array.
AB  == development of rapid molecular approaches for pathogen detection is key to improving treatment of infectious diseases. for this study, the kinetics and temperature-dependence of dna probe hybridization to uropathogen species-specific sequences were examined. a set of oligonucleotide probes were designed based on variable regions of the 16s gene of the escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella oxytoca, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. a universal bacterial probe and probes-specific for gram-positive and gram-negative organisms were also included. the oligonucleotide probes discriminated among 16s genes derived from 11 different species of uropathogenic bacteria applied to nylon membranes in a dot-blot format. significant binding of oligonucleotide probes to target dna and  removal of nonspecific binding by membrane washing could both be achieved rapidly, requiring as little as 10 min. an oligonucleotide probe from the same species-specific region of the e. coli 16s gene was used as a capture probe in a  novel electrochemical 16-sensor array based on microfabrication technology. sequence-specific hybridization of target uropathogen 16s rdna was detected through horseradish peroxidase acting as an electrochemical transducer via a second, detector probe. the sensor array demonstrated rapid, species-specific hybridization in a time course consistent with the rapid kinetics of the dot-blot hybridization studies. as in the dot-blot hybridization studies, species-specific detection of bacterial nucleic acids using the sensor array approach was demonstrated both at 65 degrees c and at room temperature. these results demonstrate that molecular hybridization approaches can be adapted to rapid, room temperature conditions ideal for an electrochemical sensor array platform.

AB  == enteric bacteria (enteriobacteriaceae) carry on their single chromosome about 4000 genes that all strains have in common (referred to here as "obligatory genes"), and up to 1300 "facultative" genes that vary from strain to strain and from species to species. in closely related species, obligatory and facultative genes are orthologous genes that are found at similar loci. we have analyzed a set of facultative genes involved in the degradation of the carbohydrates galactitol, d-tagatose, d-galactosamine and n-acetyl-galactosamine in various pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains of these bacteria. the four carbohydrates are transported into the cell by phosphotransferase (pts) uptake systems, and are metabolized by closely related or even identical catabolic enzymes via pathways that share several intermediates. in about 60% of escherichia coli strains the genes for galactitol degradation map to a gat operon at 46.8 min. in strains of salmonella enterica, klebsiella pneumoniae and k. oxytoca, the corresponding gat  genes, although orthologous to their e. coli counterparts, are found at 70.7 min, clustered in a regulon together with three tag genes for the degradation of d-tagatose, an isomer of d-fructose. in contrast, in all the e. coli strains tested, this chromosomal site was found to be occupied by an aga/kba gene cluster for the degradation of d-galactosamine and n-acetyl-galactosamine. the aga/kba and the tag genes were paralogous either to the gat cluster or to the fru genes for degradation of d-fructose. finally, in more then 90% of strains of both klebsiella species, and in about 5% of the e. coli strains, two operons were found at 46.8 min that comprise paralogous genes for catabolism of the isomers d-arabinitol (genes atl or dal) and ribitol (genes rtl or rbt). in these strains  gat genes were invariably absent from this location, and they were totally absent in s. enterica. these results strongly indicate that these various gene clusters  and metabolic pathways have been subject to convergent evolution among the enterobacteriaceae. this apparently involved recent horizontal gene transfer and  recombination events, as indicated by major chromosomal rearrangements found in their immediate vicinity.

TI  == the recognition and modification sites for the bacterial type i restriction systems kpnai, styseai, styseni and stysgi.
AB  == using an in vivo plasmid transformation method, we have determined the dna sequences recognized by the kpnai, styseai, styseni and stysgi r-m systems from klebsiella oxytoca strain m5a1, salmonella eastbourne, salmonella enteritidis and salmonella gelsenkirchen, respectively. these type i restriction-modification systems were originally identified using traditional phage assay, and described here is the plasmid transformation test and computer program used to determine their dna recognition sequences. for this test, we constructed two sets of plasmids, pl and pe, that contain phage lambda and escherichia coli k-12 chromosomal dna fragments, respectively. further, using the methylation sensitivities of various known type ii restriction enzymes, we identified the target adenines for methylation (listed in bold italics below as a or t in case of the complementary strand). the recognition sequence and methylation sites are  gaa(6n)tgcc (kpnai), aca(6n)tyca (styseai), cga(6n)tacc (styseni) and taac(7n)rtcg (stysgi). these dna recognition sequences all have a typical type i  bipartite pattern and represent three novel specificities and one isoschizomer (styseni). for confirmation, oligonucleotides containing each of the predicted sequences were synthesized, cloned into plasmid pmeca and transformed into each strain, resulting in a large reduction in efficiency of transformation (eot).

TI  == evaluation of a new cefepime-clavulanate esbl etest to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in an enterobacteriaceae strain collection.
AB  == objectives: in this study, we evaluated the performance of a new esbl etest configuration based on clavulanate synergy with cefepime compared with cefotaxime-clavulanate and ceftazidime-clavulanate esbl etest strips for the detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) in an enterobacteriaceae strain collection, with special focus on enterobacter spp. methods: overall, a total of 54 clinical isolates of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae species were evaluated: enterobacter aerogenes (n=3), enterobacter cloacae (n=10), escherichia coli (n=10), klebsiella oxytoca (n=3), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=25) and proteus mirabilis (n=3). to check etest behaviour with resistance phenotypes similar to esbl, our panel was expanded by six clinical isolates of k. oxytoca that were identified as putative producers of their chromosomal k1 beta-lactamase. results: with this panel, esbl etest was 98% sensitive with cefepime-clavulanate, 83% with cefotaxime-clavulanate, and 74% with ceftazidime-clavulanate strips. concentrating on enterobacter spp., reliable esbl detection could only be achieved by the new cefepime-clavulanate strip since it confirmed esbl production in all strains (100% sensitivity) whereas only 4/13 (31%) of enterobacter strains were positive using cefotaxime-clavulanate or ceftazidime-clavulanate strips. a limitation of using the new cefepime strip was less than optimal specificity with k1 phenotypes of k. oxytoca: among six strains, four isolates were scored false-positive by etest strips containing cefepime-clavulanate. conclusion: the new etest esbl strip containing cefepime-clavulanate is a valuable supplement to  current methods for detection of esbls. in our study collection, the cefepime-clavulanate strip was the best configuration for detection of esbls, particularly in enterobacter spp.

TI  == [bacterial pathogens, resistance patterns and treatment options in community acquired pediatric urinary tract infection].
AB  == background: epidemiology and resistance patterns of bacterial pathogens in pediatric uti show large interregional variability and rates of bacterial resistances are changing due to different antibiotic treatment. we intended to evaluate data from northern germany. patients and methods: in 100 children (53 female, 47 male, mean age 4.4 +/- 4.2 years) with community acquired uti, who presented in the emergency department of our medical school from 2000 - 2002, urine cultures were performed. inclusion criteria were: acute voiding symptoms, significant bacteriuria with growth of at least 10 (5) colony-forming units/ml urine, leukocyturia > 50/ micro l. exclusion criteria were underlying renal diseases, anatomic abnormalities of the urinary tract, age < 2 months and recurrent uti. results: patients presented with a mean rectal temperature of 38.6 +/- 1.3 degrees c, mean crp of 66 +/- 68 mg/dl, mean wbc 13 500 +/- 5 600/ micro  l and mean urinary leukocytes of 425 +/- 363/ micro l. in urine cultures e. coli  was found in 47 % of the cases, enterococcus faecalis 23 %, proteus mirabilis 8 %, klebsiella oxytoca 4 %, pseudomonas aeruginosa 5 % and others 13 %. in 76 % one and in 24 % two different bacterial species (60 % enterococcus faecalis) were cultured. mean resistance rates were in all bacteria (in e. coli): ampicillin 53  % (69 %), ampicillin and sulbactam 51 % (61 %), cefalosporin 1 (st) generation (cefaclor) 48 % (24 %), cefalosporin 2 (nd) generation (cefuroxim) 40 % (3 %), cefalosporin 3 (rd) generation (cefuroxim) 33 % (0 %), tobramycin 30 % (2 %), ciprofloxacine 0 %, cotrimoxazole 40 % (42 %), nitrofurantoin 12 % (0 %). conclusion: the resistance rates to ampicillin (+/- sulbactam) did not increase as compared to previous analyses (1990 - 1995), however, resistance rates to cotrimoxazole and 1 (st) generation cefalosporines increased about 20 %. we conclude that the policies for treatment of uti in children should be re-evaluated every 5 years according to local resistance rates.

TI  == determination of fatty acid positions in native lipid a by positive and negative  electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.
AB  == lipid a is the endotoxic principle of the lipopolysaccharide fraction from gram-negative bacteria. it is involved in the elicitation of cytokine production  that leads to massive inflammation and to septic shock as a lethal consequence. for this reason, the structural elucidation of lipopolysaccharides from toxic gram-negative bacteria is an important and complicated task, mainly owing to its  natural heterogeneity. here, a new methodology to infer the distribution of the primary and secondary acyl residues is described, based on electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (esi-ms) of intact lipid a under high cone voltage in order to achieve in-source fragmentation. under these conditions, acyl fragmentation is induced and a different regioselective cleavage of secondary fatty acids is observed in positive and negative esi-ms, allowing the rapid identification of the lipid a structure.

TI  == sanitary and bacteriological aspects of sewage treatment.
AB  == a study into the removal of contamination load and indicator bacteria was carried out in 1992-1996 in the mechanical, biological and chemical waste-water treatment plant wtp in lezany, in the county of reszel, in the province of warmia and mazury in poland. the results of chemical analyses found a high efficiency of removal of carbon compounds, cod (90%) and bod (98%), in the process of purification of household sewage. in addition, a high effectiveness of total nitrogen, on average 71%, and unsatisfactory removal of ammonia nitrogen and phosphorus compounds were found. the results of microbiological analyses confirmed the high efficiency of removal of indicator bacteria in the process of  sewage treatment from 94 to 97%. in the sewage after the final phase of purification in stabilization ponds, the following pathogenic bacteria were identified with the use of the epl 21tests: escherichia coli, enterobacter agglomerans, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter georgoriae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pnemoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella ozaenae, ervinia herbicola, edwardsiella tarda, serratia odoriefra, serratia marcescens, providencia alcalifaciens, hafnia alvei, yersina pestis, yersina pseudotuberculosis, yersinia fredericksenii, salmonella spp., shigella dysenteriae, aeromons hydrophila, pseudomonas aerulginosa. the obtained results show that although the sewage purification system is efficient and reduces the contamination load to the level required by the regulations (ministry of environmental protection, natural resources and forestry from 20 september 1991)  and removes a great percentage of indicator bacteria, the purified sewage may be  a source of pathogenic bacteria in inland waters.

TI  == [surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefmetazole between 2000  and 2002].
AB  == the antibacterial activity of cefmetazole (cmz) against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over japan was evaluated yearly for two years from june  2000 to march 2002 and compared with that of other parenteral beta-lactams, cefazolin (cez), cefotiam (ctm), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and flomoxef (fmox). in the first surveillance from june 2000 to march 2001, 575 isolates of 13 species were tested, and 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from april 2001 to march 2002. in these surveillances spanning two years, the mic90s of cmz against the bacterial species tested hardly differed. changes in percent resistance of each species to cmz (mic of cmz > or = 32 micrograms/ml) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (mssa, 0%-->0%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa, 73%-->87%), staphylococcus epidermidis (19%-->32%), other coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. (other cns, 13%-->18%), escherichia coli (4%-->1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3%-->4%), klebsiella oxytoca (0%-->0%), proteus mirabilis (2%-->2%), proteus vulgaris (14%-->7%), morganella morganii (7%-->0%), providencia spp. (17%-->0%),  peptostreptococcus spp. (0%-->0%), bacteroides fragilis (10%-->11%), and other bacteroides spp. (79%-->88%). the change in percent resistance of mrsa, s. epidermidis, other cns, and other bacteroides spp. tended to increase. in addition, the percent resistance of b. fragilis was 10%. it is necessary to pay much attention to the trends observed in these species. compared to other drugs tested, against mssa, the activity of cmz was inferior to that of cez, ctm, and fmox and superior to that of sbt/cpz. against mrsa, s. epidermidis, and cns, the  tested drugs exhibited little activity. against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and inferior to that  of fmox. against b. fragilis and other bacteroides spp., the activity of cmz was  almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and comparable to or inferior to that of  sbt/cpz and fmox. no remarkable changes in the activity of cmz were observed in this study compared with studies conducted before cmz was launched. this result suggests that cmz still maintains potent activity.

TI  == expression, purification and crystallization of an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase from klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  == oxy-1a is an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase from the conditional pathogenic bacterium klebsiella oxytoca. oxy-1a is responsible for the antibiotic resistance of this pathogen. a soluble form of oxy-1a with a his tag at its c-terminus was overexpressed in escherichia coli. the recombinant protein was purified and crystallized at room temperature using peg 4000 as the main precipitant. two crystal forms were obtained from the same growth conditions. one was orthorhombic, with crystals that diffracted to better than 1.9 a, while the other was tetragonal, with crystals that only diffracted to about 3.0 a. complete data  sets were collected from both crystal forms. the orthorhombic crystal belongs to  space group p2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 46.54, b = 73.43, c = 84.56 a, while the tetragonal crystal has unit-cell parameters a = b = 73.72, c = 96.81 a. the asymmetric unit of the orthorhombic crystal is estimated to contain  one oxy-1a molecule, giving a crystal volume per protein weight (v(m)) of 2.25 a(3) da(-1) and a solvent content of 45%.

TI  == epidemiology of conjugative plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamases in the united states.
AB  == a sample of 752 resistant klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, and escherichia coli strains from 70 sites in 25 u.s. states and the district of columbia was examined for transmissibility of resistance to ceftazidime and the nature of the plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase involved. fifty-nine percent of the k. pneumoniae, 24% of the k. oxytoca, and 44% of the e. coli isolates transferred resistance to ceftazidime. plasmids encoding ampc-type beta-lactamase were found  in 8.5% of the k. pneumoniae samples, 6.9% of the k. oxytoca samples, and 4% of the e. coli samples, at 20 of the 70 sites and in 10 of the 25 states. act-1 beta-lactamase was found at eight sites, four of which were near new york city, where the act-1 enzyme was first discovered; act-1 beta-lactamase was also found  in massachusetts, pennsylvania, and virginia. fox-5 beta-lactamase was also found at eight sites, mainly in southeastern states but also in new york. two e. coli strains produced cmy-2, and one k. pneumoniae strain produced dha-1 beta-lactamase. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and plasmid analysis suggested that ampc-mediated resistance spread both by strain and plasmid dissemination. all ampc beta-lactamase-containing isolates were resistant to cefoxitin, but so were 11% of strains containing transmissible shv- and tem-type extended-spectrum  beta-lactamases. a beta-lactamase inhibitor test was helpful in distinguishing the two types of resistance but was not definitive since 24% of clinical isolates producing ampc beta-lactamase had a positive response to clavulanic acid. coexistence of ampc and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases was the main reason for these discrepancies. plasmid-mediated ampc-type enzymes are thus responsible for  an appreciable fraction of resistance in clinical isolates of klebsiella spp. and e. coli, are disseminated around the united states, and are not so easily distinguished from other enzymes that mediate resistance to oxyimino-beta-lactams.

TI  == utility of nccls guidelines for identifying extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in  non-escherichia coli and non-klebsiella spp. of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == nccls screening and confirmation methods for detecting extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) apply only to escherichia coli and klebsiella spp., yet esbls have been found in other members of the family enterobacteriaceae. we evaluated the effectiveness of nccls methods for detecting esbls in 690 gram-negative isolates of enterobacteriaceae that excluded e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and klebsiella oxytoca. isolates were collected between january 1996  and june 1999 from 53 u.s. hospitals participating in project icare (intensive care antimicrobial resistance epidemiology). the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the isolates were determined by using the nccls broth microdilution method (bmd), and those isolates for which the mic of ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, or aztreonam was >or=2 microg/ml or the mic of cefpodoxime was >or=8 microg/ml (positive esbl screen test) were further tested for a clavulanic acid (ca) effect by bmd and the disk diffusion method (confirmation tests). although 355 (51.4%) of the isolates were esbl screen test positive, only 15 (2.2%) showed a ca effect. since 3 of the 15 isolates were already highly resistant to the five nccls indicator drugs, esbl detection would have an impact on the reporting of only 1.7% of the isolates in the study. only 6 of the 15 isolates that showed a ca effect contained a bla(tem), bla(shv), bla(ctx-m), or bla(oxa) beta-lactamase  gene as determined by pcr (with a corresponding isoelectric focusing pattern). extension of the nccls guidelines for esbl detection to enterobacteriaceae other  than e. coli and klebsiella spp. does not appear to be warranted in the united states at present, since the test has poor specificity for this population and would result in changes in categorical interpretations for only 1.7% of enterobacteriaceae tested.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii,  burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

TI  == carbapenem-resistant strain of klebsiella oxytoca harboring carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase kpc-2.
AB  == we investigated a klebsiella oxytoca isolate demonstrating resistance to imipenem, meropenem, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and aztreonam. the mics of both imipenem and meropenem were 32 microg/ml. the beta-lactamase activity against imipenem and meropenem was inhibited in the presence of clavulanic acid.  isoelectric focusing studies demonstrated five beta-lactamases with pis of 8.2 (shv-46), 6.7 (kpc-2), 6.5 (unknown), 6.4 (probable oxy-2), and 5.4 (tem-1). the  presence of the bla(shv) and bla(tem) genes was confirmed by specific pcr assays  and dna sequence analysis. transformation and conjugation studies with escherichia coli showed that the beta-lactamase with a pi of 6.7, klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-2 (kpc-2), was encoded on an approximately 70-kb conjugative plasmid that also carried shv-46, tem-1, and the beta-lactamase with  a pi of 6.5. the bla(kpc-2) determinant was cloned in e. coli and conferred resistance to imipenem, meropenem, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and aztreonam. the amino acid sequence of kpc-2 showed a single amino acid difference, s174g, when compared with kpc-1, another carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase from k. pneumoniae 1534. hydrolysis studies showed that purified kpc-2 hydrolyzed not only carbapenems but also penicillins, cephalosporins, and aztreonam. kpc-2 had the highest affinity for meropenem. the kinetic studies revealed that kpc-2 was inhibited by clavulanic acid and tazobactam. an examination of the outer membrane proteins of the parent k. oxytoca strain demonstrated that it expressed detectable levels of ompk36 (the homolog of ompc)  and a higher-molecular-weight ompk35 (the homolog of ompf). thus, carbapenem resistance in k. oxytoca 3127 is due to production of the bush group 2f, class a, carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase kpc-2. this beta-lactamase is likely located on a transposon that is part of a conjugative plasmid and thus has a very high potential for dissemination.

TI  == confirmation of escherichia coli and its distinction from klebsiella species by gas and indole formation at 44 and 44.5 degrees c.
AB  == aims: in the enumeration of coliform bacteria, confirmation of escherichia coli has been based upon gas and indole production at the elevated incubation temperature. the test for gas production has recently been questioned. the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of gas production test on the reliability of confirmation of e. coli. methods and results: the impact of several media on growth, gas and/or indole formation was tested at 44 and 44.5 degrees c using 547 environmental isolates. these were mainly e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca and enterobacter cloacae strains. another set of 250 faecal and environmental klebsiellae were tested for their maximum temperature for growth (tmax) and for gas formation. escherichia coli and even k. pneumoniae  grew well in all the media, but gas production was more dependent on the medium used. growth of the mainly gas negative ent. cloacae and k. oxytoca strains was still more sensitive to the medium and incubation conditions. tryptophan salt broth was the most productive medium for the indole test, followed by lauryl tryptose mannitole and tryptone mannitol ricinoleate broth (trm). tmax of k. oxytoca was clearly lower than tmax of k. pneumoniae but a rather high fraction of its isolates produced indole at 44.5 degrees c. conclusions: false-positive e. coli confirmation is possible if gas production is not tested for and the confirmation is based on indole test only. significance and impact of the study:  erroneous positive results on routine analysis for e. coli can occur.

AB  == we report here the use of immunomagnetic (im) electrochemiluminescence (ecl) for  quantitative detection of esherichia coli o157:h7 in water samples following enrichment in minimal lactose broth (mlb). im beads prepared in-house with four commercial anti-o157 monoclonal antibodies were compared for efficiency of cell capture. im-ecl responses for e. coli o157:h7 (strain sea13b88) were similar for  all four commercial anti-o157 lps monoclonal antibodies. the ecl signal was linearly correlated with e. coli o157:h7 cell concentration, indicating a constant ecl response per cell. twenty-two strains of e. coli o157:h7 or o157:nm  gave comparable ecl signals using im beads prepared in-house. to assess the potential for interference from background bacteria in mlb-enriched water samples, 10(4) cells of e. coli o157:h7 (strain sea13b88) were added to enriched  samples prior to analysis. there was considerable variability in recovery of e. coli o157:h7 cells; net ecl signals ranged from 1% to 100% of expected values (i.e., percent inhibition from 0% to 99%). cultures of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, and enterobacter cloacae, subsequently isolated from mlb-enriched water samples via im separation (ims), were observed to interfere with the binding of e. coli o157:h7 cells to im beads. recoveries of 10(4) e. coli o157:h7 cells were </=10% in the presence of ca. 10(8) k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, or e. cloacae cells. none of these strains gave a positive im-ecl signal. although competitive binding decreased sensitivity, there still was a linear correlation between ecl signal and higher e. coli o157:h7 cell concentrations. these studies indicate that im-ecl in conjunction with mlb enrichment is capable of quantitatively detecting as few as 10(3) to 10(5) e. coli o157:h7 cells ml(-1), depending on percent recoveries, in enriched samples that contain ca. 10(9) total lactose-fermenting bacteria ml(-1). assuming comparable growth rates for e. coli o157:h7 and other lactose-fermenting bacteria in mlb, it may be possible to detect as few as one e. coli o157:h7 in 100 ml of raw water containing as many as 10(4) to 10(6) lactose-fermenting bacteria (i.e., total coliforms).

TI  == comparison of the e-test method with an automated bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility detection system for screening extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers.
AB  == some automated systems used in clinical microbiology laboratories are able to detect products responsible for antimicrobial resistance. in this study, 626 isolates (436 escherichia coli, 134 klebsiella pneumoniae and 56 klebsiella oxytoca strains) were examined for the presumptive detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production by 2 methods: the sceptor system (bd, sparks, md, usa) and the e-test. esbl production was detected in 26 e. coli strains (5.96%), 60 k. pneumoniae strains (44.77%) and 15 k. oxytoca strains (26.78%) by  ceftazidime/ceftazidime-clavulanate e-test. using the e-test, esbl production was detected in 25 of 201 e. coli strains (12.43%), 55 of 75 k. pneumoniae (73.33%) and 14 of 27 k. oxytoca strains (51.85%) that were alerted as esbl-producing strains by the sceptor system. esbl positivity was detected in 1 e. coli, 5 k. pneumoniae and 1 k. oxytoca strains, that were not warned as being esbl producers by the sceptor system. these data suggest that clinical microbiology laboratories should not only rely on these rapid automated systems but also use another method for screening esbl producers, such as the e-test. the rates of these esbl-producing isolates in this study were lower than those in other studies reported from other parts of turkey, but higher than those reported from the usa  and europe.

TI  == clinical and microbiologic analysis of a hospital's extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing isolates over a 2-year period.
AB  == study objective: to evaluate the microbiologic and clinical outcomes of patients  with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing isolates over a 2-year period. design: retrospective analysis. setting: tertiary care teaching hospital. patients: twenty-one patients with cultures of confirmed esbl-producing escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, or klebsiella oxytoca. measurements and  main results: antimicrobial susceptibilities of piperacillin-tazobactam, cefotetan, carbapenems, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and nitrofurantoin (nitrofurantoin for urinary isolates only) of confirmed esbl producers at our institution were determined, as well as clinical outcomes of patients with esbl-producing isolates. microbiologic and medical records were reviewed for patient sex and age, antimicrobial susceptibilities, antimicrobial therapy, and clinical and microbiologic outcomes. from january 2000-december 2001, 31 isolates were confirmed as esbl producers (6  e. coli, 11 k. pneumoniae, and 14 k. oxytoca). a statistically significant increase occurred over the 2-year period from 9 (0.6%) of 1414 isolates in 2000 to 22 (1.8%) of 1218 isolates in 2001 (p = 0.0055). all isolates were susceptible to carbapenems, and more than 88% were susceptible to amikacin, cefotetan, or nitrofurantoin. less than 70% of isolates were susceptible to gentamicin, fluoroquinolones, piperacillin-tazobactam, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. all  patients treated with a carbapenem experienced clinical cure. piperacillin-tazobactam alone and in combination resulted in an overall clinical  cure rate of 55%, with a 50% cure rate for isolates susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam. all patients in whom antibiotic therapy failed had been  treated with piperacillin-tazobactam or cefepime, either alone or in combination  with a fluoroquinolone. conclusion: carbapenems remain the treatment of choice for esbl-producing pathogens. piperacillin-tazobactam and cefepime should not be  routinely administered for the treatment of these organisms.

TI  == comparison of fecal flora following administration of two antibiotic protocols for suspected maternofetal infection.
AB  == two protocols are used by french neonatologists for the treatment of suspected maternofetal infection (smfi). three groups of premature and term neonates were included to study the impact of antibiotics on fecal flora: 10 infants with smfi  treated with amoxicillin and netilmicin (group bi), 10 infants with smfi treated  with amoxicillin, cefotoxime and netilmicin (group tri) and 10 infants without antibiotic therapy as controls (group c). group bi samples were colonized with klebsiella oxytoca and escherichia coli resistant to amoxicillin and by eneterococcus faecium and coagulase-negative staphylococci. in group tri biodiversity of the intestinal flora was low, with rapid growth of staphyloccoci  and occurrence of candida spp. these modifications of the intestinal flora should encourage us to use antibiotic treatment as targeted as possible.

TI  == bacteremia in hematological and oncological children with febrile neutropenia: experience in a tertiary medical center in taiwan.
AB  == a retrospective study of bacteremia in children with febrile neutropenia admitted to a medical center in taiwan from january 1999 to december 1999 was performed. there were 190 episodes of febrile neutropenia during this period and 46 pathogens were isolated from blood specimens in 38 bacteremic episodes (7 mixed infections). pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.4%), staphylococcus aureus (10.9%), klebsiella pneumoniae (10.9%), and enterobacter cloacae (10.9%) were the most common isolates. three of the 5 isolates of s. aureus were resistant to methicillin. twenty-three episodes of bacteremia (four mixed infections) were associated with recent antibiotic use. of the 23 bacteremic episodes with recent  antibiotic use, p. aeruginosa (20%), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (10%), k. pneumoniae (10%), escherichia coli (10%), and e. cloacae (10%) were isolated most often. relapsed leukemia (odds ratio 3, 95% confidence interval 1.4-6.5) and recent antibiotic therapy (odds ratio 3.4, 95% confidence interval 1.7-7.7) were  the independent risk factors of bacteremia. there were 9 mortality cases in patients with bacteremia, including 4 cases with mixed infections, and 5 cases with p. aeruginosa, e. coli, klebsiella oxytoca, s. aureus, and streptococcus mitis, respectively. broad-spectrum antibiotics were necessary in febrile neutropenic children because of the high percentage of mixed infection.

TI  == indole can act as an extracellular signal to regulate biofilm formation of escherichia coli and other indole-producing bacteria.
AB  == we demonstrated previously that genetic inactivation of tryptophanase is responsible for a dramatic decrease in biofilm formation in the laboratory strain escherichia coli s17-1. in the present study, we tested whether the biochemical inhibition of tryptophanase, with the competitive inhibitor oxindolyl-l-alanine,  could affect polystyrene colonization by e. coli and other indole-producing bacteria. oxindolyl-l-alanine inhibits, in a dose-dependent manner, indole production and biofilm formation by strain s17-1 grown in luria-bertani (lb) medium. supplementation with indole at physiologically relevant concentrations restores biofilm formation by strain s17-1 in the presence of oxindolyl-l-alanine and by mutant strain e. coli 3714 (s17-1 tnaa::tn5) in lb medium. oxindolyl-l-alanine also inhibits the adherence of s17-1 cells to polystyrene for a 3-h incubation time, but mutant strain 3714 cells are unaffected. at 0.5 mg/ml, oxindolyl-l-alanine exhibits inhibitory activity against biofilm formation in lb  medium and in synthetic urine for several clinical isolates of e. coli, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter koseri, providencia stuartii, and morganella morganii but has no affect on indole-negative klebsiella pneumoniae strains. in conclusion, these data suggest that indole, produced by the action of tryptophanase, is involved in polystyrene colonization by several indole-producing bacterial species. indole may act as a signalling molecule to regulate the expression of adhesion and biofilm-promoting factors.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. a total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabillis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii), pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobactor baumannii, acinetobactor lwoffii, bacteroides fragilis  group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron),  and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lwoffii throughout 6 years. the mic90 of  czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however, the decrease in antibacterial activities of czop against b. cepacia, and h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == cloning, characterization, and functional expression of the klebsiella oxytoca xylodextrin utilization operon (xyntb) in escherichia coli.
AB  == escherichia coli is being developed as a biocatalyst for bulk chemical production from inexpensive carbohydrates derived from lignocellulose. potential substrates  include the soluble xylodextrins (xyloside, xylooligosaccharide) and xylobiose that are produced by treatments designed to expose cellulose for subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis. adjacent genes encoding xylobiose uptake and hydrolysis were cloned from klebsiella oxytoca m5a1 and are functionally expressed in ethanologenic e. coli. the xylosidase encoded by xynb contains the cog3507 domain characteristic of glycosyl hydrolase family 43. the xynt gene encodes a membrane  protein containing the melb domain (cog2211) found in na(+)/melibiose symporters  and related proteins. these two genes form a bicistronic operon that appears to be regulated by xylose (xylr) and by catabolite repression in both k. oxytoca and recombinant e. coli. homologs of this operon were found in klebsiella pneumoniae, lactobacillus lactis, e. coli, clostridium acetobutylicum, and bacillus subtilis  based on sequence comparisons. based on similarities in protein sequence, the xyntb genes in k. oxytoca appear to have originated from a gram-positive ancestor related to l. lactis. functional expression of xynb allowed ethanologenic e. coli to metabolize xylodextrins (xylosides) containing up to six xylose residues without the addition of enzyme supplements. 4-o-methylglucuronic acid substitutions at the nonreducing termini of soluble xylodextrins blocked further  degradation by the xynb xylosidase. the rate of xylodextrin utilization by recombinant e. coli was increased when a full-length xynt gene was included with  xynb, consistent with xynt functioning as a symport. hydrolysis rates were inversely related to xylodextrin chain length, with xylobiose as the preferred substrate. xylodextrins were utilized more rapidly by recombinant e. coli than k. oxytoca m5a1 (the source of xynt and xynb). xynb exhibited weak arabinosidase activity, 3% that of xylosidase.

AB  == asymptomatic prostatitis is classified as category iv in nih classification of prostatitis syndrome (1999). no report concerning this category has been present. we investigated this category histopathologically and clinically, in order to clarify the histopathological distribution and its correlation to the clinical features, in this study. among 785 patients who were suspected prostate cancer because of their high prostatic specific antigen (psa) values and to have a sextant prostate needle biopsy was performed between january, 1996 and december,  2000, 88 patients (11.2%) were diagnosed as nih category iv prostatitis (asymptomatic prostatitis). we observed all pathological specimens stained with hematoxylin-eosine, and classified them into subtypes according to the classification criteria for prostatitis defined by true et al. (1999). we also investigated the relationship between histopathological distribution and clinical features such as psa values, psa density, the incidence of pyuria or bacteriuria. in the histopathological study, grade distributions were 12.5% (11/88) in mild, 71.6% (63/88) in moderate, and 15.9% (14/88) in severe. location distributions were 2.3% (2/88) in glandular, 68.2% (60/88) in periglandular, and 29.5% (26/88)  in stromal. no relationship between these subtypes and clinical features was recognized statistically. however, 7 patients (7.95%) were diagnosed as prostate  cancers, later. pyuria was found in 29.1% (23/79). bacteriuria was present in 14.3% (11/77). isolated bacteria were 4 strains of enterococcus faccalis, 2 strains of each of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus, and one strain of each of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, staphylococcus haemolyticus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. gram positive rod, and candida sp. no relationship between these subtypes and bacterial species was recognized. these results indicated that the incidence of niii category iv prostatits was not low without correlation to any clinical features. however, we should pay attention to the presence of prostate cancer, because a small number of the patients were diagnosed as prostate cancer, later.

TI  == in vitro susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria isolated from hospitalized patients in four european countries, canada, and the united states in 2000-2001 to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and comparator antimicrobials: implications for therapy.
AB  == access to current antimicrobial agent surveillance data is an important prerequisite for the optimal management of patients with hospital-acquired infections. the present study used data collected in 2000 to 2001 from 670 laboratories in europe (france, germany, italy, and spain), canada, and the united states to report on the in vitro activities of ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and comparative agents against >125,000 isolates of gram-negative bacteria from hospitalized patients. all but two isolates of enterobacteriaceae (one isolate of proteus mirabilis from france and one isolate of morganella morganii from canada) were susceptible to imipenem. the susceptibility of escherichia coli to ceftriaxone or cefotaxime was > or = 97% in each country, and for p. mirabilis, susceptibility was 99% in each country except italy. in contrast, susceptibility  of e. coli to ciprofloxacin varied from 80.5% (spain) to 94.0% (france); levofloxacin susceptibility ranged from 75.2% (spain) to 91.6% (united states). among klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca isolates, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime susceptibilities ranged from 86.6 to 98.7% and 83.5 to 99.7%, respectively, depending upon the country. considerable geographic variation in the susceptibilities (generally 85 to 95% susceptible) of serratia marcescens and m. morganii to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime were observed. for s. marcescens, susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam varied from 81.5% (france) to 94.1% (italy) and susceptibility to ciprofloxacin ranged from 66.2% (germany) to 90.7%  (spain). enterobacter cloacae and enterobacter aerogenes were less susceptible to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime than were the other species of enterobacteriaceae studied. the present study demonstrated that established parenteral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin antimicrobial agents retain significant in vitro  activity against many clinically important gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == bacteria engineered for fuel ethanol production: current status.
AB  == the lack of industrially suitable microorganisms for converting biomass into fuel ethanol has traditionally been cited as a major technical roadblock to developing a bioethanol industry. in the last two decades, numerous microorganisms have been engineered to selectively produce ethanol. lignocellulosic biomass contains complex carbohydrates that necessitate utilizing microorganisms capable of fermenting sugars not fermentable by brewers' yeast. the most significant of these is xylose. the greatest successes have been in the engineering of gram-negative bacteria: escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, and zymomonas mobilis. e. coli and k. oxytoca are naturally able to use a wide spectrum of sugars, and work has concentrated on engineering these strains to selectively produce ethanol. z. mobilis produces ethanol at high yields, but ferments only glucose and fructose. work on this organism has concentrated on introducing pathways for the fermentation of arabinose and xylose. the history of constructing these strains and current progress in refining them are detailed in  this review.

TI  == ampc beta-lactamase producing multidrug resistant strains of klebsiella spp. & escherichia coli isolated from children under five in chennai.
AB  == background & objectives: ampc beta-lactamases are group i cephalosporinases that  confer resistance to a wide variety of beta-lactam drugs. plasmid mediated ampc beta-lactamases has been discovered most frequently in isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, salmonella, proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. the present study was undertaken to study the occurrence of multidrug resistant and ampc beta-lactamase producing klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli in children less than five years of age as this age group is very susceptible to intestinal and extraintestinal infections. methods: a total of 116 isolates of klebsiella species and 32 isolates of esch. coli were tested for resistance to cephamycin such as cefoxitin, third generation cephalosporin (3gc) antibiotics (ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone), ampicillin, amikacin, cephaloridine, cefuroxime, co-trimoxazole, gentamycin, imipenem and tetracycline by disc diffusion method. isolates found resistant to cefoxitin were tested for the production of ampc beta-lactamases by three dimensional extract method. transconjugation experiments were done to study the transfer of drug resistance and ampc beta lactamase production from ampc producing klebsiella and esch. coli isolates to a recipient  esch. coli strain (k12 j62-2). results: twenty eight isolates (24.1%) of klebsiella spp. and 12 (37.5%) of esch. coli were found to be ampc beta-lactamase producers; 66.6 per cent and 81 per cent of klebsiella and esch. coli isolates respectively showed resistance to all the 3gcs. all the strains were found to be  sensitive to imipenem. eighty four (72%) of klebsiella isolates and 20 (62.5%) of esch. coli were found to be resistant to cefoxitin. transfer of cefoxitin resistance to the recipient strain was observed in all the ampc producing strains of klebsiella spp. of the 12 ampc producing strains of esch. coli, only 4 (33.3%) showed the transfer of cefoxitin resistance to the recipient strain. interpretation & conclusion: this study has shown the occurrence of ampc beta-lactamase producing klebsiella and esch. coli strains in children in chennai. since ampc beta-lactamase production is frequently accompanied by multiresistance to antibiotics, therapeutic options become limited resulting a need for new measures for the management of klebsiella and esch. coli infections. also failure to identify ampc beta-lactamase producers may lead to inappropriate  antimicrobial treatment and may result in increased mortality. detecting plasmid  mediated ampc beta-lactamase producing strains is technically difficult and the phenotypic tests for ampc detection are not well defined. if an investigational ampc beta-lactamase inhibitor was made available for diagnostic testing, it could be useful in combination with a suitable cephamycin to confirm ampc production.

TI  == type iv-like pili formed by the type ii secreton: specificity, composition, bundling, polar localization, and surface presentation of peptides.
AB  == the secreton or type ii secretion machinery of gram-negative bacteria includes several type iv pilin-like proteins (the pseudopilins) that are absolutely required for secretion. we previously reported the presence of a bundled pilus composed of the pseudopilin pulg on the surface of agar-grown escherichia coli k-12 cells expressing the klebsiella oxytoca pullulanase (pul) secreton genes at  high levels (n. sauvonnet, g. vignon, a. p. pugsley, and p. gounon, embo j. 19:2221-2228, 2000). we show here that pulg is the only pseudopilin in purified pili and that the phenomenon is not restricted to the pul secreton reconstituted  in e. coli or to pulg. for example, high-level expression of the endogenous e. coli gsp secreton genes caused production of bundled pili composed of the pseudopilin gspg, and the pul secreton was able to form pili composed of pulg-like proteins from secreton systems of other bacteria. pulg derivatives in which the c terminus was extended by the addition of eight different peptides were also assembled into pili and functioned in secretion. three of the c-terminal peptides were shown to be exposed along the entire length of the assembled pili. hence, the c terminus of pulg may represent a permissive site for the insertion of immunogenic epitopes or other peptide sequences. one of these pulg variants, with a six-histidine tag at its c terminus, formed nonpolar, nonbundled pili, suggesting that bundle formation and polar localization are not  correlated with the ability of pulg to function in secretion. we propose that the pulg pilus is an artifactual manifestation of a periplasmic "pseudopilus" and that cycles of pseudopilus extension and retraction within the periplasm propel pullulanase through secretin channels in the outer membrane. abnormally long pili that extend beyond the outer membrane are produced only when pilus length control and retraction are deregulated by overproduction of the major pseudopilus subunit (pulg).

AB  == the effect of temperature of incubation on lag times of two gram-negative foodborne bacteria was investigated. bacteria were instantaneously transferred between temperatures within and beyond the normal physiological temperature range (nptr). abrupt temperature shifts induced lag phases, but the degree of the response was dependent on the direction and magnitude of the shift. temperature downshifts induced larger relative lag times (rlt; the ratio of lag time to generation time), than equivalent upshifts. the hypothesis of robinson et al. [int. j. food microbiol. 44 (1998) 83] that lag time can be understood in terms of the amount of work to be done to adjust to new environmental conditions and the rate at which that work is done was supported. deviation of the reported proportionality between lag time and generation time was observed when late-exponential phase cells were subjected to abrupt temperature shifts from beyond the normal physiological range.

TI  == conjugative plasmid mediated inducible nickel resistance in hafnia alvei 5-5.
AB  == hafnia alvei 5-5, isolated from a soil-litter mixture underneath the canopy of the nickel-hyperaccumulating tree sebertia acuminata (sapotaceae) in new caledonia, was found to be resistant to 30 mm ni(2+) or 2 mm co(2+). the 70-kb plasmid, pejh 501, was transferred by conjugation to escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, and klebsiella oxytoca. transconjugant strains expressed inducible nickel resistance to between 5 and 17 mm ni(2+), and cobalt resistance to 2 mm co(2+). a 4.8-kb sal- ecori fragment containing the nickel resistance determinant was subcloned, and the hybrid plasmid was found to confer a moderate level of resistance to nickel (7 mm ni(2+)) even to e. coli. the expression of nickel resistance was inducible by exposure to nickel chloride at a concentration as low as 0.5 mm ni(2+). by random tn phoa'-1 insertion mutagenesis, the fragment was shown to have structural genes as well as regulatory regions for nickel resistance. southern hybridization studies showed that the nickel-resistance determinant from pejh501 of h. alvei 5-5 was homologous to that of ptom9 from alcaligenes xylosoxydans 31a.

TI  == characterization of clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae from italy by the bd  phoenix extended-spectrum beta-lactamase detection method.
AB  == production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) is an important mechanism of beta-lactam resistance in enterobacteriaceae: identification of esbls based on phenotypic tests is the strategy most commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories. the phoenix esbl test (bd diagnostic systems, sparks, md.) is a recently developed automated system for detection of esbl-producing gram-negative bacteria. an algorithm based on phenotypic responses to a panel of cephalosporins (ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, cefotaxime plus clavulanic acid,  cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone plus clavulanic acid) was used to test 510 clinical  isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus  mirabilis, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, and citrobacter  koseri. of these isolates, 319 were identified as esbl producers, and the remaining 191 were identified as non-esbl producers based on the results of current phenotypic tests. combined use of isoelectric focusing, pcr, and/or dna sequencing demonstrated that 288 isolates possessed bla(tem-1)- and/or bla(shv-1)-derived genes, and 28 had a bla(ctx-m) gene. among the 191 non-esbl-producing isolates, 77 isolates produced an ampc-type enzyme, 110 isolates possessed tem-1, tem-2, or shv-1 beta-lactamases, and the remaining four isolates (all k. oxytoca strains) hyperproduced k1 chromosomal beta-lactamase. the phoenix esbl test system gave positive results for all the 319 esbl-producing isolates and also for two of the four k1-hyperproducing isolates of k. oxytoca. compared with the phenotypic tests and molecular analyses, the phoenix system displayed 100% sensitivity and 98.9% specificity. these findings suggest that the phoenix esbl test can be a rapid and reliable method for laboratory detection of  esbl resistance in gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == structural rationalization for the lack of stereospecificity in coenzyme b12-dependent diol dehydratase.
AB  == adenosylcobalamin-dependent diol dehydratase of klebsiella oxytoca is apparently  not stereospecific and catalyzes the conversion of both (r)- and (s)-1,2-propanediol to propionaldehyde. to explain this unusual property of the enzyme, we analyzed the crystal structures of diol dehydratase in complexes with  cyanocobalamin and (r)- or (s)-1,2-propanediol. (r)- and (s)-isomers are bound in a symmetrical manner, although the hydrogen-bonding interactions between the substrate and the active-site residues are the same. from the position of the adenosyl radical in the modeled "distal" conformation, it is reasonable for the radical to abstract the pro-r and pro-s hydrogens from (r)- and (s)-isomers, respectively. the hydroxyl groups in the substrate radicals would migrates from c(2) to c(1) by a suprafacial shift, resulting in the stereochemical inversion at c(1). this causes 60 degrees clockwise and 70 degrees counterclockwise rotations  of the c(1)-c(2) bond of the (r)- and (s)-isomers, respectively, if viewed from k+. a modeling study of 1,1-gem-diol intermediates indicated that new radical center c(2) becomes close to the methyl group of 5'-deoxyadenosine. thus, the hydrogen back-abstraction (recombination) from 5'-deoxyadenosine by the product radical is structurally feasible. it was also predictable that the substitution of the migrating hydroxyl group by a hydrogen atom from 5'-deoxyadenosine takes place with the inversion of the configuration at c(2) of the substrate. stereospecific dehydration of the 1,1-gem-diol intermediates can also be rationalized by assuming that asp-alpha335 and glu-alpha170 function as base catalysts in the dehydration of the (r)- and (s)-isomers, respectively. the structure-based mechanism and stereochemical courses of the reaction are proposed.

TI  == mutations which uncouple transport and phosphorylation in the d-mannitol phosphotransferase system of escherichia coli k-12 and klebsiella pneumoniae 1033-5p14.
AB  == mutants of escherichia coli k-12 were isolated which lack the normal phosphotransferase system-dependent catabolic pathway for d-mannitol (mtl). in some mutants the pts genes for the general proteins enzyme i and histidine protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent carbohydrate phosphotransferase systems were deleted. other mutants expressed truncated mannitol-specific enzymes ii (ii(mtl)) which lacked the iia(mtl) or iiba(mtl) domain(s), and the mtla genes originated either from e. coli k-12 or from klebsiella pneumoniae 1033-5p14. the  dald gene from klebsiella oxytoca m5a1 was cloned on single-copy plasmids and transformed into the strains described above. this gene encodes an nad-dependent  d-arabinitol dehydrogenase (dald) which converts d-arabinitol into d-xylulose and also converts d-mannitol into d-fructose. the different strains were used to isolate mutations which allow efficient transport of mannitol through the nonphosphorylated ii(mtl) complexes by selecting for growth on this polyhydric alcohol. more than 40 different mutants were analyzed to determine their ability  to grow on mannitol, as well as their ability to bind and transport free mannitol and, after restoration of the missing domain(s), their ability to phosphorylate mannitol. four mutations were identified (e218a, e218v, h256p, and h256y); all of these mutations are located in the highly conserved loop 5 of the iic membrane-bound transporter, and two are located in its gihe motif. these mutations were found to affect the various functions in different ways. interestingly, in the presence of all ii(mtl) variants, whether they were in the  truncated form or in the complete form, in the phosphorylated form or in the nonphosphorylated form, and in the wild-type form or in the mutated form, growth  occurred on the low-affinity analogue d-arabinitol with good efficiency, while only the uncoupled mutated forms transported mannitol at a high rate.

AB  == objective: to detect the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in family enterobacteriaceae and analyze the antibiotic susceptibility of those esbls-producing strains. methods: esbls were determined by the double-disk confirmatory test and 8 antibiotic susceptibilities were tested with the disk disffusion method in those strains producing esbls. results: forty-seven esbls-producing strains comprised of 25 of e. coli, 14 of k. pneumoniae, 5 of e.  cloacae, 1 of k. oxytoca, 1 of k. rhinoscleromatis, and 1 of s. liquefaciens. the susceptibility rates of those strains were: 100% for imipenem and meropenem, 89.4% for piperacillin/tazobactam, 72.4% for cefoxitin and 65.9% for cefotetan. conclusion: e. coli and k. pneumoniae are the prime strains producing esbls in enterobacteriaceae. imipenem and meropenem are the best drugs to deal with those  esbls-producing strains. piperacillin/tazobactam is better than cephamycins and other beta-lactama/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination.

TI  == comparison of bdphoenix and vitek2 automated antimicrobial susceptibility test systems for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase detection in escherichia coli and klebsiella species clinical isolates.
AB  == the present study compares the ability to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) among a collection of 34 esbl producing clinical isolates  belonging to escherichia coli and klebsiella species with two new rapid susceptibility and identification instruments-vitek2 (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) vs. bdphoenix (bd biosciences, sparks, md). esbl content in these isolates was previously characterized on the basis of pcr amplification and sequencing results which were used as the reference method in our evaluation. bdphoenix correctly determined the esbl outcome for all strains tested (100% detection rate), whereas vitek2 was not able to detect the esbl status in 5 isolates (85% detection rate). detailed analysis revealed that the discrepancies  were mainly observed with 'difficult-to-detect' strains. misidentification was either due to low oximino cephalosporin mic in these strains or was associated with pronounced 'cefotaximase' or 'ceftazidimase' phenotypes. klebsiella oxytoca  chromosomal beta-lactamase (k1) is phenotypically quite similar to esbl enzymes.  in order to evaluate whether the k1 and esbl enzymes could be discriminated, we expanded our analysis by 8 clinical k. oxytoca strains with k1 phenotypes. vitek2 gave excellent identification of these strains whereas 7 out of 8 were falsely labeled esbl-positive by the bdphoenix system.

TI  == ammonium hydroxide hydrolysis: a valuable support in the maldi-tof mass spectrometry analysis of lipid a fatty acid distribution.
AB  == lipid a is the lipophilic moiety of lipopolysaccharides (lpss), the major components of the external membrane of almost all gram-negative bacteria. it is responsible for the toxicity of lps and has a heterogeneous structure composed of a bis-phosphorylated glucosamine disaccharide backbone that is acylated at the positions 2, 3 of the glcn i (proximal) and glcn ii (distal) residue with o- and  n-linked 3-hydroxy fatty acids (primary substitution). these fatty acids are further acylated by means of their 3-hydroxy groups (secondary substitution). the toxicity of lipid a is dependent on its primary structure; the number, the length, and the distribution of the fatty acids on the disaccharide backbone strongly influence the endotoxic activity. in this paper a general and easy methodology to obtain secondary fatty acid distribution, which is one of the most difficult issues in the structural determination of lipid a, is proposed. the method combines ammonium hydroxide hydrolysis and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (maldi)-mass spectrometry analysis and has been successfully proven with five different lipid a species. the procedure exploits the lower stability under mild alkaline conditions of acyl and acyloxyacyl esters with respect to that of the acyl and acyloxyacyl amides. the partially degraded lipid a species obtained are analyzed by maldi-ms. the generality of this approach was tested on five lipid as, namely those arising from escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, pseudomonas reactans, and burkholderia caryophylli.

AB  == thirty-three patients (24 males and nine females) with brain abscesses resulting  from infection by aerobic gram-negative bacilli were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital over a period of 14 years. of these, 23 cases developed spontaneously, with the remaining ten postneurosurgery. the organisms most frequently involved were klebsiella (k.) pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and proteus species and included some rare pathogens, such as salmonella and enterobacter species, k. oxytoca, vibrio and morganella morganii.  apart from one exception, the locations of the abscess were supratentorial. twenty-four patients presented with a single abscess, while nine revealed multiple abscesses, with 26 treated surgically and seven with antibiotics exclusively. in total, seven patients died, representing an overall mortality rate of 21%. this study demonstrates that brain abscesses associated with neurosurgical procedures are not rare, accounting for 30% of cases in this study, with k. pneumoniae, proteus and enterobacter species the most prevalent of the revealed pathogens. further, proteus species were the most prevalent pathogens demonstrated for cases of both otogenic and polymicrobial infections. if brain abscesses are diagnosed for diabetic patients or have a gas-forming appearance, a diagnosis of k. pneumoniae infection should be considered, with particular attention paid to detection of other metastatic septic abscesses. in light of the high mortality rate, early treatment is essential to maximize the chances of survival.

TI  == structural requirements of the mrna for intracistronic translation initiation of  the enterobacterial infb gene.
AB  == background: the gene infb encodes the prokaryotic translation initiation factor if2, a central macromolecular component in the formation of the ribosomal 70s initiation complex. in escherichia coli, infb encodes three forms of if2: if2alpha, if2beta and if2gamma. the expression of if2beta and if2gamma is a tandem translation from intact infb mrna and not merely a translation of post-transcriptionally truncated mrna. the molecular mechanism responsible for the ribosomal recognition of the two intracistronic translation initiation sites  in e. coli infb is not well characterized. results: we found three different forms of if2 in enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, salmonella enterica, salmonella typhimurium, and two different forms in proteus vulgaris. we identified the intracistronic translation initiation sites of the mrna by isolation and n-terminal sequencing of the shorter isoforms of if2 in s. enterica and s. typhimurium. a further search in the readily available public sequence databases revealed that infb from yersinia pestis also contains an intracistronic in-frame initiation site used for the translation of if2beta. the base composition in a part of the 5' end of the dna coding strand of the enterobacterial infb gene shows a strong preference for adenine (a) over thymine  (t) with a maximum ratio of a-to-t around the intracistronic initiation sites. we demonstrate that the mrna has an open structure around the ribosomal binding region. conclusion: efficient intracistronic translation initiation of the infb gene is suggested to require an mrna with this special base composition that results in an open, single-stranded structure at the ribosomal binding region.

TI  == beta-lactamases involved in resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins in escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. clinical isolates collected between 1994 and 1996, in barcelona (spain).
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of decreased susceptibility to broad-spectrum cephalosporins in enterobacteriaceae that lack inducible chromosomal bla genes, and to determine the enzymes responsible for resistance. from all clinically relevant enterobacteriaceae strains isolated between 1994 and 1996, 88 of 7054 escherichia coli, seven of 581 klebsiella pneumoniae and 23 of 166 klebsiella oxytoca strains were studied because of their decreased susceptibilities to broad-spectrum cephalosporins (as reflected in intermediate susceptibilities and/or positive synergy tests and/or irregular crenellated inhibition zones). the most frequent mechanism implicated in decreased susceptibility to broad-spectrum cephalosporins displayed by e. coli and k. oxytoca was hyperproduction of chromosomal beta-lactamase, followed by plasmid-mediated shv-1 hyperproduction in e. coli. in our hospital, the incidence of plasmid-mediated extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) between 1994 and 1996 was low. esbls were found in only 10 (0.14%) e. coli strains (six ctx-m-9, two tem-12 and two shv-2), in one (0.17%) k. pneumoniae strain (shv-2) and in no  k. oxytoca strains. the relatively wide variety of beta-lactamases that were detected among these common bacteria isolated from a single medical centre, including non-tem- and non-shv-derived esbls, appears epidemiologically remarkable.

AB  == objective: the incidence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbetal)-mediated resistance has increased markedly during the past decade. risk factors for colonization with esbetal-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella species (esbetal-ek) remain unclear, as do methods to control their further emergence. design: case-control study. setting: two hospitals within a large academic health system: a 725-bed academic tertiary-care medical center and a 344-bed urban community hospital. patients: thirteen patients with esbetal-ek fecal colonization were compared with 46 randomly selected noncolonized controls. results: duration of hospitalization was the only independent risk factor for esbetal-ek colonization (odds ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.21). of note, 8 (62%) of the patients had been admitted from another healthcare facility. in addition, there was evidence for dissemination of a single k oxytoca clone. finally, the prevalence of esbetal-ek colonization decreased from 7.9% to  5.7% following restriction of third-generation cephalosporins (p = .51). conclusions: esbetal-ek colonization was associated only with duration of hospitalization and there was no significant reduction following antimicrobial formulary interventions. the evidence for nosocomial spread and the high percentage of patients with esbetal-ek admitted from other sites suggest that greater emphasis must be placed on controlling the spread of such organisms within and between institutions.

AB  == ceftriaxone was introduced into clinical practice in the usa in 1985 and was the  first extended-spectrum (third-generation) cephalosporin approved for once-daily  treatment of patients with gram-positive or gram-negative infections. review of ceftriaxone activity is important given its continued use since the mid-1980s and reports of emerging resistance among all antimicrobial agent classes. we reviewed the activity of ceftriaxone and relevant comparative agents against five gram-positive and 11 gram-negative species for a 5-year period, 1996-2000, using  data from the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa. all mic results were interpreted using nccls breakpoint criteria. ceftriaxone resistance among isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (n=17219) remained essentially unchanged over the 5 years studied and in fact was lower from 1998 to 2000 (5.0-5.1%) than  in 1996 (6.3%) and 1997 (6.6%). ceftriaxone resistance (range, 5.1-6.9%) among viridans group streptococci (n=6621) varied by <2% from 1997 to 2000. beta-lactam-resistant streptococcus pyogenes (n=935) and group b beta-haemolytic  streptococci (n=2267) were not identified in any year. among methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (n=39 284) ceftriaxone resistance was 0.1-0.3% per year from 1996 to 2000. ceftriaxone resistance among escherichia coli (n=472407; range, 0.2-0.4%), klebsiella oxytoca (n=16231; range, 3.5-4.8%),  klebsiella pneumoniae (n=117754; range, 1.9-2.6%), proteus mirabilis (n=67692; range, 0.2-0.3%), morganella morganii (n=11251; range, 0.3-2.1%) and serratia marcescens (n=26519; range, 1.6-3.8%) was low and consistent from 1996 to 2000. resistance to ceftriaxone among enterobacter cloacae (n=48114; range, 21.7-23.9%) was relatively high, compared with other enterobacteriaceae, but unchanged from 1996 to 2000. rates of resistance to ceftriaxone among acinetobacter spp. (n=20813) increased from 24.8% in 1996 to 45.1% in 2000. all haemophilus influenzae (n=7911) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (n=218) were susceptible to ceftriaxone, as were 99.7% of moraxella catarrhalis (n=312) tested in 1996 and 1997. in summary, ceftriaxone has retained its potent activity against the most commonly encountered gram-positive and gram-negative human pathogens despite widespread and ongoing clinical use for more than 15 years.

TI  == bacterial colonization of intravenous catheters in young dogs suspected to have parvoviral enteritis.
AB  == objective: to determine the prevalence of bacterial colonization of iv catheters  among young dogs suspected to have parvoviral enteritis, to identify the organisms responsible for catheter colonization, and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of organisms that were obtained. design: case series. animals: 100 dogs. procedure: catheters were aseptically removed when fluid therapy was discontinued, the catheter was replaced, or the dog died. the distal tip of the catheter was cut off, split open, and vortexed with sterile saline (0.9% nacl) solution. the saline solution was plated on culture plates, which were then incubated and examined for bacterial growth every 24 hours for 72 hours. all bacteria cultured were identified, and antimicrobial susceptibility was determined. results: bacteria were isolated from 22 catheters. most bacteria  that were isolated were of gastrointestinal tract or environmental origin (serratia odorifera, s. liquefaciens, s. marcescens, acinobacter anitratus, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, escherichia coli, enterobacter spp). only 2 gram-positive organisms were isolated (staphylococcus intermedius and streptococcus spp). high percentages of organisms were resistant  to penicillin, lincomycin, cloxacillin, erythromycin, and cephalexin. percentages of organisms resistant to amikacin, enrofloxacin, chloramphenicol, potentiated sulfonamides, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid were low. conclusions and clinical  relevance: results suggest that iv catheters may be colonized with bacteria in 22% of young dogs suspected to have parvovirus infection.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. changes in czop susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), escherichia coli (n = 276), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), enterobacter  aerogenes (n = 93), serratia marcescens (n = 172), serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), citrobacter freundii (n = 177), citrobacter koseri (n = 70), proteus mirabilis (n = 113), proteus vulgaris (n = 89), morganella morganii (n = 116), providencia spp. (n = 41), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), pseudomonas putida (n = 63), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and prevotella/porphyromonas (n = 173). an antibacterial activity of czop against e.  coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, and s. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against m.(b.) catarrhalis, c. koseri, and p. aeruginosa  was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, and p. mirabilis increased year by year. the increase in mic90 of czop against e. aerogenes and p. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. in contract, the susceptibility of e. cloacae  to czop was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to czop. mic90 of czop against c. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. additionally, mic90 of czop against h. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little  higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. an antibacterial activity of czop against p. fluorescens, p. putida, b. cepacia, s.  maltophilia, b. fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. changes in mic90 of czop against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.

TI  == extended spectrum beta lactamase production & multidrug resistance in klebsiella  species isolated from children under five with intestinal & extraintestinal infections.
AB  == background & objectives: extended spectrum beta-lactamases (es beta l) are enzymes produced in some gram-negative bacilli that mediate resistance to third generation cephalosporins (3gc) and aztreonam. these are common in klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli and in other members of the family enterobacteriaceae.  es beta l production is accompanied by resistance to other antibiotics as these are encoded by multi drug resistance conjugative plasmids. the present study was  undertaken to study the incidence of multi drug resistant and es beta l producing klebsiella spp. in children under five years of age suffering from intestinal and extraintestinal infections. methods: a total of 90 strains of klebsiella spp. (76 isolates of k. pneumoniae and 14 of k. oxytoca) were tested for resistance to 3gc antibiotics (ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone), amikacin, ampicillin, erythromycin, gentamycin and streptomycin by disc diffusion method. isolates found resistant to 3gc antibiotics were tested for the production of es beta l by double disc diffusion synergy test. transconjugation experiments were done to study the transfer of drug resistance and es beta l production from klebsiella isolates to an esch. coli strain (k12 j62-2). results: all the 90 isolates showed multi drug resistance; 87 (96.6%) isolates showed resistance or decreased susceptibility to at least one of the three 3gc. es beta l production was detected in four strains of k. pneumoniae and two k. oxytoca. es beta l activity  could be experimentally transferred to recipient esch. coli in all the 6 isolates. resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics was co-transferred along with resistance to gentamycin. interpretation & conclusion: this study has shown the incidence of es beta l producing klebsiella strains in children in chennai, and possibly poses a threat in the treatment and management of klebsiella associated  infections. the incidence of es beta l producing strains of klebsiella and other  members of enterobacteriaceae should be carefully monitored in children to prevent unnecessary use of antibiotics especially 3gc and aminoglycoside antibiotics. hence, tests for the detection of es beta l producing klebsiella strains should be carried out routinely for better therapeutic management.

TI  == microbial populations of an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor treating wastewater from a gelatin industry.
AB  == the microbial populations of an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor, used for treating wastewater from the gelatin industry, were studied by microbiological methods and phase-contrast and electron microscopy. microscopy examination of the sludge showed a complex mixture of various rod-shaped and coccoid bacterial pluslong filaments and verymobile curved rods. in addition free-living anaerobic  ciliates and flagellates were also observed. the trophic group population observed in decreasing order of dominance were hydrolytic and acetogenic at 10(6) and sulfate reducing and methanogenic at 10(5). the rate of methane production in anaerobic granular sludge cultivated in growth medium supplement with formate pressurized with h2:co2 showed a significant increase in methane yield compared with theseed culture containingthe same substrate and atmosphere of n2:co2. similar rates of methane production were observed when the growth medium was supplemented with acetate pressurized either with h2:co2 or n2:co2. the number of total anaerobic bacteria at 10(7), fecal coliforms and total coliforms at 10(6),  and fecal streptococci at 10(3) is based on colony counts on solid media. the four prevalent species of facultative anaerobic gram-negative bacteria that belong to the family of enterobacteriaceae were identified as escherichia coli, esherichia fergusonii, klebsiella oxytoca, and citrobacter freundii. the species  aeromonas hydrophila, aeromonas veronii, acinetobacter iwoffi and stenotrophomonas maltophila were the most frequently isolated glucose fermenting  and nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli.

TI  == [in vitro antimicrobial activity of glutaraldehyde plus o-phenylphenol association (ratio 2:1)].
AB  == background: the correct use of antiseptics, disinfectants and sterilization processes to inactivate or remove micro-organisms is an essential component of an effective infection control program. to reach this result the use of phenolic detergent-disinfectants which work well as a presoak has always been suggested in lieu of sterilization involving submerging instruments in a properly prepared glutaraldehyde solution for about 6 to 10 hrs. this study investigated the in vitro effectiveness of disinfectant solution containing 2% glutaraldehyde and 1%  o-phenylphenol. methods: the organisms used were purchased from the american type culture collection (escherichia coli atcc 25922, candida albicans atcc 10231, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228), and from our clinical collection (proteus mirabilis ch 14, klebsiella oxytoca ch 22, serratia liquefaciens ch 90). mic and  mbc were evaluated as testing solution for antimicrobial activity. the contact time studied between disinfectant and bacteria were 30 sec, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 30 min. results: the results showed that mic values for most bacteria were 3.75 mg/ml. the mbc values were similar or higher than the mic. the disinfectant solution killed e. coli and c. albicans already after 10 min, but for s. aureus 30 min was necessary. conclusions: this study proved that this solution attained  the sterilization of surgical instruments in good timing and at low cost.

TI  == betalasen: microdilution panel for identifying beta-lactamases present in isolates of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == a dried investigational use-only microdilution panel named betalasen (a short named derived from the panel's purpose, to identify beta-lactamases in enterobacteriaceae) containing 10 beta-lactam drugs with and without beta-lactamase inhibitors was developed to identify beta-lactamases among clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter koseri, citrobacter freundii group, enterobacter spp., and serratia marcescens. the mics obtained with a collection of 383 organisms containing well-characterized beta-lactamases were used to develop numeric codes and logic pathways for computerized analysis of results. the resultant logic pathways and betalasen panel were then used to test and identify beta-lactamases among 885 isolates of enterobacteriaceae recovered in cultures obtained at six different hospital laboratories across the united states. beta-lactamases present in 801 (90.5%) of the 885 isolates were identified by betalasen by using the existing logic pathways and codes or after minor modifications were made to the existing codes. the 84 strains that gave codes that betalasen could not identify were collected, reidentified, and retested by using betalasen. three strains had been  misidentified, 54 strains gave different codes upon repeat testing that could be  identified by betalasen, and 27 strains repeated new codes. the beta-lactamases in these strains were identified, and the new codes were added to the betalasen logic pathways. these results indicate that betalasen can identify clinically important beta-lactamases among most isolates of enterobacteriaceae. the results  also show that good quality control and attention to proper performance of the tests are essential to the correct performance of betalasen.

TI  == retrospective study of children with acute pyelonephritis. evaluation of bacterial etiology, antimicrobial susceptibility, drug management and imaging studies.
AB  == the purpose of the study was to investigate the management of pyelonephritis in a large italian pediatric population. a total of 1,333 patients (36% male) were considered. escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated agent (89.9%), followed by proteus mirabilis (3.6%) and klebsiella oxytoca (2.1%). 27% of microorganisms were resistant to amoxicillin, 4% to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid,  11% to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 2.4% to gentamicin and less than 2% to ceftazidime. despite this resistance pattern showing that oral antibiotics, such  as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, are effective in vitro as well as parenteral antimicrobials, a parenteral antibiotic was given initially to 756 (57.2%) children. a prophylactic regimen was started in 922 patients with a rate of reinfection during prophylaxis of 9.5%; a higher rate of reinfection was observed in patients with reflux (25%) compared to children without reflux (3%) (p < 0.0001). vesicoureteral reflux was demonstrated in 30% of patients. the number of renal abnormalities detected by dmsa in patients with and without reflux was significantly different (p < 0.001). crp was higher in patients with scars (p < 0.02). in conclusion, pyelonephritis represents a common disease with about 2,500 days of hospitalization per year in the veneto region where there is a pediatric  population of about 800,000 under 15 years of age. the results of antimicrobial in vitro tests indicate that amoxillicin/clavulanic acid could represent the antibiotic of choice. the high frequency of malformations, observed even in children between 6 and 12 years of age, may suggest the need of an imaging study  including dmsa scan and vcug in all age groups.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases: epidemiology, detection, and treatment.
AB  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) are extremely broad spectrum beta-lactamase enzymes found in a variety of enterobacteriaceae. most strains producing these beta-lactamases are klebsiella pneumoniae, other klebsiella species (i.e., k. oxytoca), and escherichia coli. when producing these enzymes, organisms become highly effective at inactivating various beta-lactam antibiotics. in addition, esbl-producing bacteria are frequently resistant to many classes of antibiotics, resulting in difficult-to-treat infections. other problems due to esbl-producing bacteria are difficulty in detecting the presence  of esbls, limited treatment options, and deleterious impact on clinical outcomes. clinicians should be familiar with the clinical significance of these enzymes and potential strategies for dealing with this growing problem.

TI  == bacillus subtilis contains a cyclodextrin-binding protein which is part of a putative abc-transporter.
AB  == bacillus subtilis is able to grow on alpha-, beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins as a carbon source via a yet unknown metabolizing system. sequence analysis of the b.  subtilis genome reveals that the putative yvfk-yvfo operon seems to be involved in cyclodextrin utilization, containing the open reading frame yvfk, now termed cycb. the amino acid sequence derived from the dna sequence bears high similarities to solute-binding proteins from b. subtilis, as well as to cyme from klebsiella oxytoca and male from escherichia coli, both encoding solute-binding proteins able to interact with cyclodextrins. a [his](6)-tagged variant of cycb from b. subtilis was constructed, overproduced in e. coli and purified. the modified protein has been used to study its substrate specificity by surface plasmon resonance and fluorescence spectroscopy. from these data, cycb can be classified as a cyclodextrin-binding protein which interacts with all three natural cyclodextrins: alpha, beta and gamma, thereby showing the highest affinity to gamma-cyclodextrin.

TI  == characterization of clinical isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae from 19 laboratories using the national committee for clinical laboratory standards extended-spectrum beta-lactamase detection methods.
AB  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) are enzymes found in gram-negative bacilli that mediate resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins and aztreonam. in 1999, the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) published methods for screening and confirming the presence of esbls in klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, and escherichia coli. to evaluate the  confirmation protocol, we tested 139 isolates of k. pneumoniae that were sent to  project icare (intensive care antimicrobial resistance epidemiology) from 19 hospitals in 11 u.s. states. each isolate met the nccls screening criteria for potential esbl producers (ceftazidime [caz] or cefotaxime [ctx] mics were > or =2 microg/ml for all isolates). initially, 117 (84%) isolates demonstrated a clavulanic acid (ca) effect by disk diffusion (i.e., an increase in caz or ctx zone diameters of > or =5 mm in the presence of ca), and 114 (82%) demonstrated a ca effect by broth microdilution (reduction of caz or ctx mics by > or =3 dilutions). for five isolates, a ca effect could not be determined initially by broth microdilution because of off-scale caz results. however, a ca effect was observed in two of these isolates by testing cefepime and cefepime plus ca. the cefoxitin mics for 23 isolates that failed to show a ca effect by broth microdilution were > or =32 microg/ml, suggesting either the presence of an ampc-type beta-lactamase or porin changes that could mask a ca effect. by isoelectric focusing (ief), 7 of the 23 isolates contained a beta-lactamase with  a pi of > or =8.3 suggestive of an ampc-type beta-lactamase; 6 of the 7 isolates  were shown by pcr to contain both ampc-type and bla(oxa) genes. the ief profiles  of the remaining 16 isolates showed a variety of beta-lactamase bands, all of which had pis of < or =7.5. all 16 isolates were negative by pcr with multiple primer sets for ampc-type, bla(oxa), and bla(ctx-m) genes. in summary, 83.5% of the k. pneumoniae isolates that were identified initially as presumptive esbl producers were positive for a ca effect, while 5.0% contained beta-lactamases that likely masked the ca effect. the remaining 11.5% of the isolates studied contained beta-lactamases that did not demonstrate a ca effect. an algorithm based on phenotypic analyses is suggested for evaluation of such isolates.

AB  == background: approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. the time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. study design and methods: isolates  of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, corynebacterium species, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus viridans were inoculated into day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 cfu per ml (2 units/organism). each bag was sampled 10 times (20 ml/sample). four ml of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 ml was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 ml into thioglycollate broth. results: with the exception of p. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. a range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. a mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 cfu/ml inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of p. acnes in anaerobic bottles. conclusion: bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 cfu per ml. p. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). however, p. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination.  such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet  storage.

TI  == identification of a non-haem catalase in salmonella and its regulation by rpos (sigmas).
AB  == we report the identification and functional analysis of katn, a gene encoding a non-haem catalase of salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium. katn, which is not present in escherichia coli, is located between the ycigfe and ycid e. coli homologues in the salmonella genome. its predicted protein product has a molecular weight of 31 826 da and is similar to the mn-catalases of lactobacillus plantarum and thermus spp. its product, katn, was visualized as a 37 kda protein  in e. coli maxicells. a katn recombinant protein, containing six histidine residues at its c-terminus, was purified, and its catalase activity was observed  on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. katn was also visualized by catalase activity gel staining of bacterial cell extracts. its expression was shown to be  regulated by growth phase and rpos. northern blotting indicated that kat forms an operon with the upstream ycigfe genes. a putative rpos-regulated promoter was identified upstream of ycig. southern blotting revealed that katn is conserved within salmonella serovars. katn homologues were found in pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens. a katn mutation did not appear to affect the hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) response of salmonella. however, the expression of katn increased the h2o2 resistance of unadapted cells in the exponential phase and of rpos mutants in stationary phase. thus, katn may contribute to hydrogen peroxide resistance in salmonella in certain environmental conditions.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolone photodegradation products determined by parallel-line bioassay and high performance liquid chromatography.
AB  == the fluoroquinolones produce multiple photodegradation products. little is known  about these products, particularly whether any possess antimicrobial activity. to investigate this, we used the parallel-line bioassay to investigate discrepancies in zone of inhibition size in conjunction with high performance liquid chromatography (hplc) analysis. a continuous flow photochemical reaction unit ('beam-boost') was used to partially photodegrade the fluoroquinolones ofloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin (0.02 mm) by between 15 and 89%, as  confirmed by hplc. the concentration of residual parent fluoroquinolone in each irradiated sample was measured by hplc and a non-irradiated control solution was  prepared at the same concentration. these were compared by parallel-line bioassays using escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella oxytoca. with ofloxacin and levofloxacin, the zone size for the control solution was significantly less than that of the irradiated solutions, with >15% photodegradation in at least two of the indicator organisms, indicating that the  photodegradation products possess antimicrobial activity. no difference was seen  with ciprofloxacin at any level of photodegradation with any of the indicator organisms, nor with moxifloxacin at 30 and 54% photodegradation. a significant difference was observed with e. cloacae only, at 83% photodegradation.

TI  == disulfide bond formation in secreton component pulk provides a possible explanation for the role of dsba in pullulanase secretion.
AB  == when expressed in escherichia coli, the 15 klebsiella oxytoca pul genes that encode the so-called pul secreton or type ii secretion machinery promote pullulanase secretion and the assembly of one of the secreton components, pulg, into pili. besides these pul genes, efficient pullulanase secretion also requires the host dsba gene, encoding a periplasmic disulfide oxidoreductase, independently of disulfide bond formation in pullulanase itself. two secreton components, the secretin pilot protein puls and the minor pseudopilin pulk, were  each shown to posses an intramolecular disulfide bond whose formation was catalyzed by dsba. puls was apparently destabilized by the absence of its disulfide bond, whereas pulk stability was not dramatically affected either by a  dsba mutation or by the removal of one of its cysteines. the pullulanase secretion defect in a dsba mutant was rectified by overproduction of pulk, indicating reduced disulfide bond formation in pulk as the major cause of the secretion defect under the conditions tested (in which puls is probably present in considerable excess of requirements). pulg pilus formation was independent of  dsba, probably because pulk is not needed for piliation.

TI  == cost-effective and rapid presumptive identification of gram-negative bacilli in routine urine, pus, and stool cultures: evaluation of the use of chromagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests.
AB  == the algorithm for a new identification system was designed on the basis of colony color and morphology on chromagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests such as indole (ind), lysine decarboxylase (ldc), and ornithine decarboxylase (odc) utilization tests with gram-negative bacilli isolated from urine samples as well as pus, stool, and other clinical specimens by the following colony characteristics, biochemical reactions, and serological results: pinkish to red, ind positive (ind(+)), escherichia coli; metallic blue, ind(+), ldc(+), and odc negative (odc(-)), klebsiella oxytoca; ind(+), ldc(-), and odc(+), citrobacter diversus; ind(+) or ind(-), ldc(-), and odc(-), citrobacter freundii; ind(-), ldc(+), and odc(+), enterobacter aerogenes; ind(-), ldc(-), and odc(+), enterobacter cloacae; ind(-), ldc(+), and odc(-), klebsiella pneumoniae;  diffuse brown and ind(+), morganella morganii; ind(-), proteus mirabilis; aqua blue, serratia marcescens; bluish green and ind(+), proteus vulgaris; transparent yellow-green, serology positive, pseudomonas aeruginosa; clear and serology positive, salmonella sp.; other colors and reactions, the organism was identified by the full identification methods. the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of this new system were prospectively evaluated. during an 8-month period, a total of 345 specimens yielded one or more gram-negative bacilli. a total of 472 gram-negative bacillus isolates were detected on chromagar orientation medium. for 466 of the isolates (98.7%), no discrepancies in the results were obtained on the basis of the identification algorithm. the cost of identification of gram-negative bacilli during this period was reduced by about 70%. the results of this trial for the differentiation of the most commonly encountered gram-negative pathogens in clinical specimens with the new algorithm were favourable in that it permitted reliable detection and presumptive identification. in addition, this rapid identification system not only significantly reduced costs but it also improved the daily work flow within the clinical microbiology laboratory.

TI  == microbiological findings in febrile neutropenia.
AB  == background: this study was carried out to assess the isolation rate of bacterial  and fungal causative agents in mexican neutropenic adults with hematological neoplasia. methods: a prospective observational survey involving 120 consecutive  episodes of febrile neutropenia during 1 year was carried out. these episodes were observed in 630 patients discharged with diagnoses of leukemia or lymphoma,  or after bone-marrow transplantation. results: at least one pathogen was isolated in 42 of 120 episodes (35%), and was present in 39 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (aml) (43%), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all) (23%), and in patients who underwent bone-marrow transplantation (20%). primary bacteremia was the most  frequent cause of fever (24 episodes, 57%), followed by intravascular device-related infections (5 episodes, 17%), and soft-tissue infections (5 episodes, 15%). escherichia coli (33%) was the most frequently isolated agent of  primary bacteremia, followed by coagulase-negative staphylococcus (29%), and klebsiella oxytoca (16%). fungal infection was responsible for five events (4%):  two episodes of pneumonia (penicillium marneffei and aspergillus fumigatus, one event each); two cases of fungemia, one due to candida tropicalis and one to rhodotorula gluttinis, and one cryptococcal meningitis event. conclusions: the isolation rate, approximately 30%, was in accordance with previous reports; similar percentages of gram-positive and gram-negative isolates were found. a remarkably low rate of viridans group streptococci and fungal agents was observed, despite the fact that neutropenia is the main risk factor for infection due to these agents. studies reporting local microbiological findings are necessary because they support an antibiotic choice for prophylaxis or therapy more accurately than reports from other areas.

AB  == background: infections are the major life-threatening complication of burn injury and occur with the greatest frequency in children. knowledge of their occurrence  and management, however, is extrapolated from studies in adults. we performed a prospective study of infectious complications in burned children. objective: to delineate epidemiology, risk factors and microbiology of infections in burned children where burn care and surgical interventions are optimal. methods: children hospitalized for burns were entered into prospective study. characteristics of the burn injury were assessed, and active surveillance for infections was performed. results: seventy patients were entered [mean age, 42 months; mean total body surface area (tbsa), burn 15%]. twenty-seven percent of patients developed 39 infections: 13 involved the burn wound (burn wound sepsis,  6; graft loss, 5; and cellulitis, 2); 13 were catheter-associated septicemia; 13  involved other sites (i.e. pneumonia, 4; urinary tract infection, 3; bacteremia,  2; endocarditis, 1; myocardial abscess, 1; toxin-mediated syndrome, 1; and otitis media, 1). twenty-three infections were caused by a single organism, 9 infections by more than 1 organism and in 7 infections defined by cdc criteria no organism was recovered. organisms causing infection were: staphylococcus aureus, 19; candida albicans, 4; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4; coagulase-negative staphylococcus, 4; enterococcus sp., 3; escherichia coli, 1; klebsiella oxytoca,  1; serratia marcescens, 1; streptococcus pneumoniae, 1; streptococcus pyogenes, 1; aspergillus fumigatus, 1; and candida parapsilosis, 1. burn mechanism (flame and inhalation), extent (tbsa >30%) and depth (full thickness) were risk factors  for infection; young age and site of burn were not. conclusion: the most common infections occurring in burn children are burn wound infections and catheter-associated septicemia. characteristics of burn injury predict risk of infection. children with flame and inhalation injury, tbsa burned >30% and full thickness burns are at high risk of infectious complications.

TI  == specificities of reactivating factors for adenosylcobalamin-dependent diol dehydratase and glycerol dehydratase.
AB  == adenosylcobalamin-dependent glycerol and diol dehydratases undergo inactivation by the physiological substrate glycerol during catalysis. in the permeabilized cells of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, and recombinant escherichia coli, glycerol-inactivated glycerol dehydratase and diol dehydratase are reactivated by their respective reactivating factors in the presence of atp, mg2+, and adenosylcobalamin. both of the reactivating factors consist of two subunits. to examine the specificities of the reactivating factors, their genes or their hybrid genes were co-expressed with dehydratase genes in e. coli cells in various combinations. the reactivating factor of k. oxytoca for diol dehydratase efficiently cross-reactivated the inactivated glycerol dehydratase, whereas the reactivating factor of k. pneumoniae for glycerol dehydratase hardly  cross-reactivated the inactivated diol dehydratase. both of the two hybrid reactivating factors rapidly reactivated the inactivated glycerol dehydratase. in contrast, the hybrid reactivating factor containing the large subunit of the glycerol dehydratase reactivating factor hardly reactivated the inactivated diol  dehydratase. these results indicate that the glycerol dehydratase reactivating factor is much more specific for the dehydratase partner than the diol dehydratase reactivating factor and that a large subunit of the reactivating factors principally determines the specificity for a dehydratase.

TI  == interaction of resd with regulatory regions of anaerobically induced genes in bacillus subtilis.
AB  == the two-component regulatory proteins resd and rese are required for anaerobic nitrate respiration in bacillus subtilis. resd, when it undergoes rese-dependent  phosphorylation, is thought to activate transcriptionally anaerobically induced genes such as fnr, hmp and nasd. in this report, deletion analysis of the fnr, hmp and nasd promoter regions was carried out to identify cis-acting sequences required for resde-dependent transcription. the results suggest that the hmp and  nasd promoters have multiple target sequences for resde-dependent regulation and  that fnr has a single target site. gel mobility shift assays and dnase i footprinting analyses were performed to determine whether resd interacts directly with the regulatory regions of the three genes. our results indicate that resd specifically binds to sequences residing upstream of the hmp and nasd promoters and that phosphorylation of resd significantly stimulates this binding. in contrast, a higher concentration of resd is required for binding to the fnr promoter region and no stimulation of the binding by resd phosphorylation was observed. taken together, these results suggest that resd activates transcription of fnr, hmp and nasd by interacting with dna upstream of these promoters. our results suggest that phosphorylation of resd stimulates binding to multiple resd  binding sites, but is much less stimulatory if only a single binding site exists.

TI  == pathways for the utilization of n-acetyl-galactosamine and galactosamine in escherichia coli.
AB  == among enteric bacteria, the ability to grow on n-acetyl-galactosamine (galnac or  aga) and on d-galactosamine (galn or gam) differs. thus, strains b, c and ec3132  of escherichia coli are aga+ gam+ whereas e. coli k-12 is aga- gam-, similarly to klebsiella pneumoniae kay2026, klebsiella oxytoca m5a1 and salmonella typhimurium lt2. the former strains carry a complete aga/kba gene cluster at 70.5 min of their gene map. these genes encode an aga-specific phosphotransferase system (pts) or iiaga (agavwe) and a galn-specific pts or iigam (agabcd). both ptss belong to the mannose-sorbose family, i.e. the iib, iic and iid domains are encoded by different genes, and they share a iia domain (agaf). furthermore, the  genes encode an aga6p-deacetylase (agaa), a galn6p deaminase (agai), a tagatose-bisphosphate aldolase comprising two different peptides (kbayz) and a putative isomerase (agas), i.e. complete pathways for the transport and degradation of both amino sugars. the genes are organized in two adjacent operons (kbazagavwefa and agas kbayagabcdi) and controlled by a repressor agar. its gene  agar is located upstream of kbaz, and agar responds to galnac and galn in the medium. all aga- gam- strains, however, carry a deletion covering genes agaw' ef  'a; consequently they lack active iiaga and iigam ptss, thus explaining their inability to grow on the two amino sugars. remnants of a putative recombination site flank the deleted dna in the various aga- gam- enteric bacteria. derivatives with an aga+ gam- phenotype can be isolated from e. coli k-12. these retain the deltaagaw' ef 'a deletion and carry suppressor mutations in the gat and nag genes for galactitol and n-acetyl-glucosamine metabolism, respectively, that allow growth on aga but not on galn.

AB  == pectin-rich residues from sugar beet processing contain significant carbohydrates and insignificant amounts of lignin. beet pulp was evaluated for conversion to ethanol using recombinant bacteria as biocatalysts. hydrolysis of pectin-rich residues followed by ethanolic fermentations by yeasts has not been productive because galacturonic acid and arabinose are not fermentable to ethanol by these organisms. the three recombinant bacteria evaluated in this study, escherichia coli strain ko11, klebsiella oxytoca strain p2, and erwinia chrysanthemi ec 16 ploi 555, ferment carbohydrates in beet pulp with varying efficiencies. e. coli ko11 is able to convert pure galacturonic acid to ethanol with minimal acetate production. using an enzyme loading of 10.5 filter paper units of cellulase, 120.4 polygalacturonase units of pectinase, and 6.4 g of cellobiase (per gram of  dry wt sugar beet pulp), with substrate addition after 24 h of fermentation, 40 g of ethanol/l was produced. other recombinants exhibited lower ethanol yields with increases in acetate and succinate production.

AB  == the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008  mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12  mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at  2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.

TI  == pilus formation and protein secretion by the same machinery in escherichia coli.
AB  == the secreton (type ii secretion) and type iv pilus biogenesis branches of the general secretory pathway in gram-negative bacteria share many features that suggest a common evolutionary origin. five components of the secreton, the pseudopilins, are similar to subunits of type iv pili. here, we report that when  the 15 genes encoding the pullulanase secreton of klebsiella oxytoca were expressed on a high copy number plasmid in escherichia coli, one pseudopilin, pulg, was assembled into pilus-like bundles. assembly of the 'secreton pilus' required most but not all of the secreton components that are essential for pullulanase secretion, including some with no known homologues in type iv piliation machineries. two other pseudopilins, pullulanase and two outer membrane-associated secreton components were not associated with pili. thus, pulg is probably the major component of the pilus. expression of a type iv pilin gene, the e.coli k-12 gene ppdd, led to secreton-dependent incorporation of ppdd pilin  into pili without diminishing pullulanase secretion. this is the first demonstration that pseudopilins can be assembled into pilus-like structures.

TI  == overproduction of the secretin outd suppresses the secretion defect of an erwinia chrysanthemi outb mutant.
AB  == outb is a component of the erwinia chrysanthemi out secretion machinery. homologues of outb have been described in two other bacteria, klebsiella oxytoca  and aeromonas hydrophila, but their requirement in the secretion process seems to be different. study of outb topology with the blam topology probe suggests that it is an inner-membrane protein with a large periplasmic domain. however, fractionation experiments indicate that it could be associated with the outer membrane through its c-terminal part. the secretion deficiency of an erw. chrysanthemi outb mutant can be reversed by the addition of an inducer of the kdgr regulon. it was shown that this effect results from the increased expression of the secretin outd and that secretion can be restored in an outb mutant by introducing the outd gene on a plasmid. several experiments suggest an interaction between outb and outd. in erw. chrysanthemi, the presence of outd stabilizes outb. outd expressed in escherichia coli can be protected from proteolytic degradation by the coexpression of outb. this effect does not require the n-terminal, transmembrane segment of outb. outb can be cross-linked with outd by formaldehyde. these results indicate that outb could act with outd in the functioning of the out secretion machinery.

AB  == the susceptibility of enterobacteria to gentamicin was studied in the county of north jutland during 1993-1998. a total of 378 patients had a first-time gentamicin-resistant isolate. the annual number rose from 34 patients in 1993 to  89 in 1998. the prevalence of resistance per 1000 patients with isolates examined was 13.5 for escherichia coli, 15.8 for klebsiella pneumoniae, 26.1 for klebsiella oxytoca, and 150.4 for citrobacter freundii. e. coli accounted for 67% of gentamicin-resistant isolates. k. oxytoca was probably associated with a nosocomial epidemic, whereas a source for c. freundii remained unresolved. an analysis confined to e. coli identified specimens other than urine as risk factors for gentamicin resistance. likewise, resistance to sulfonamides and to fluoroquinolones were strong risk factors for gentamicin resistance among urinary isolates of e. coli. thus, it is likely that aminoglycoside resistance may be promoted by other antibiotic groups due to co-resistance. the therapeutic and prophylactic uses of aminoglycosides have as yet not been undermined, but continuous population-based surveillance and vigilance are recommended.

TI  == multiple interactions between pullulanase secreton components involved in stabilization and cytoplasmic membrane association of pule.
AB  == we report attempts to analyze interactions between components of the pullulanase  (pul) secreton (type ii secretion machinery) from klebsiella oxytoca encoded by a multiple-copy-number plasmid in escherichia coli. three of the 15 pul proteins (b, h, and n) were found to be dispensable for pullulanase secretion. the following evidence leads us to propose that pule, pull, and pulm form a subcomplex with which pulc and pulg interact. the integral cytoplasmic membrane protein pull prevented proteolysis and/or aggregation of pule and mediated its association with the cytoplasmic membrane. the cytoplasmic, n-terminal domain of  pull interacted directly with pule, and both pulc and pulm were required to prevent proteolysis of pull. pulm and pull could be cross-linked as a heterodimer whose formation in a strain producing the secreton required pulg. however, pull and pulm produced alone could also be cross-linked in a 52-kda complex, indicating that the secreton exerts subtle effects on the interaction between pule and pull. antibodies against pulm coimmunoprecipitated pull, pulc, and pule  from detergent-solubilized cell extracts, confirming the existence of a complex containing these four proteins. overproduction of pulg, which blocks secretion, drastically reduced the cellular levels of pulc, pule, pull, and pulm as well as  puld (secretin), which probably interacts with pulc. the pul secreton components  e, f, g, i, j, k, l, and m could all be replaced by the corresponding components  of the out secretons of erwinia chrysanthemi and erwinia carotovora, showing that they do not play a role in secretory protein recognition and secretion specificity.

AB  == 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. the 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. the implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included enterobacter species (enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), klebsiella species (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca), escherichia coli, staphylococcus species (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus, serratia marcescens, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus viridans and neisseria meningitidis. six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included e. cloacae in one, a. baumannii in one, k. pneumoniae in one and s. aureus in three. the management of  these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the  high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. however, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.

TI  == the yersinia high-pathogenicity island is present in different members of the family enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == a pathogenicity island termed high-pathogenicity island (hpi) is present in pathogenic yersinia. this 35 to 45 kb island carries genes involved in synthesis, regulation and transport of the siderophore yersiniabactin. recently, the hpi was also detected in various strains of escherichia coli. in this study, the distribution of the hpi in the family enterobacteriaceae was investigated. among  the 67 isolates pertaining to 18 genera and 52 species tested, nine (13.4%) harbored the island. these isolates were three e. coli, one citrobacter diversus  and five klebsiella of various species (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, klebsiella ozaenae, klebsiella planticola, and klebsiella oxytoca). as in yersinia sp., all nine isolates synthesized the hpi-encoded iron-repressible proteins hmwp1 and hmwp2. in the k. oxytoca strain, the right-end portion of the hpi was deleted, whereas the entire core region of the island was present in the eight other enterobacteria strains analyzed. in most of these isolates, the hpi was bordered by an asn trna locus, as in yersinia sp. this report thus demonstrates the spread of the hpi among various members of the  family enterobacteriaceae.

AB  == the prevalence of esbl was determined among isolates of escherichia coli (n = 571) and klebsiella spp. (n = 196) collected during a 1-week study period in 8 university and 3 large regional laboratories all over the netherlands. 18 isolates were positive for at least one of the screening tests used, i.e., vitek-esbl, e-test esbl and mic ratio of ceftazidime/ceftazidime-clavulanic acid, cefotaxime/cefotaxime-clavulanic acid. in 5 of these 18 putative esbls no betalactamase production was detectable. a tem type was found in three e. coli and two klebsiella spp. an shv type was present in five klebsiella spp. in one e. coli and one klebsiella pneumoniae both enzymes were present. in one klebsiella oxytoca neither of the two enzymes was present. using pcr for both esbl tem and esbl shv, an shv esbl was found in one e. coli and four klebsiella isolates. the  mutations at position 238 and 240 were already described. in one e. coli isolate  a tem esbl was found with three mutations, at position 21, 164 and 265. these mutations were already described in other esbls but not in this combination suggesting a new tem esbl. the overall prevalence of esbl producing e. coli and klebsiella spp. was less than 1% (6 out of 767).

TI  == the genetic structure of enteric bacteria from australian mammals.
AB  == a total of 246 isolates representing five species of the family enterobacteriaceae, taken from a variety of australian mammal species, were characterized using multi-locus enzyme electrophoresis. genome diversity estimates varied significantly among species, with the klebsiella pneumoniae sample exhibiting the lowest diversity and the citrobacter freundii sample the highest. multi-locus linkage disequilibrium estimates revealed that alleles were  non-randomly associated in all five species samples, but the magnitude of the estimates differed significantly among species. escherichia coli had the lowest linkage disequilibrium estimate and klebisella oxytoca the largest. molecular analyis of variance was used to determine the extent to which population structure explained the observed genetic variation in a species. two population levels were defined: the taxonomic family of the host from which the isolate was  collected and the geographical locality where the host was collected. the amount  of explained variation varied from 0% for k. oxytoca to 22% for k. pneumoniae. host locality explained a significant amount of the genetic variation in the c. freundii (12%), e. coli (5%), hafnia alvei (17%) and k. pneumoniae (22%) samples. host family explained a significant fraction of the variation in e. coli (6%) h.  alvei (7%) and k. pneumoniae (20%). estimates of effective population size for all five species, based on the probability that two randomly chosen isolates will be identical, failed to reveal any relationship between the effective population  size and the genetic diversity of a species.

TI  == the distribution of enteric bacteria from australian mammals: host and geographical effects.
AB  == bacteria of the family enterobacteriaceae were isolated from 642 mammalian hosts, representing 16 families and 79 species, collected from throughout australia. escherichia coli was the most common of the 24 enteric species recovered and represented almost half of the isolates. association analysis revealed that most  other species of bacteria were less likely to be recovered from hosts in which e. coli was present. the composition of the enteric community of a host was found to be determined by both the taxonomic family to which the host belonged and the geographical area from which the host was collected. hosts collected from the northern areas of queensland and the northern territory had more diverse enteric  communities than hosts collected from new south wales or western australia. hosts of the families petauridae and vespertilionidae had more diverse enteric communities than did members of the macropodidae or phalangeridae. the probability of occurrence of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, hafnia alvei, klebsiella oxytoca and k. pneumoniae in a host was found to vary with respect to host family and/or host locality. the non-random distribution of these species demonstrates the presence of extensive population structure and may suggest the existence of adaptations specific to both the primary and secondary habitats of these enteric bacteria.

TI  == enteric bacterial catalysts for fuel ethanol production.
AB  == the technology is available to produce fuel ethanol from renewable lignocellulosic biomass. the current challenge is to assemble the various process options into a commercial venture and begin the task of incremental improvement.  current process designs for lignocellulose are far more complex than grain to ethanol processes. this complexity results in part from the complexity of the substrate and the biological limitations of the catalyst. our work at the university of florida has focused primarily on the genetic engineering of enteric bacteria using genes encoding zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase. these two genes have been assembled into a portable ethanol production cassette, the pet operon, and integrated into the chromosome of escherichia coli b for use with hemicellulose-derived syrups. the resulting strain, ko11, produces ethanol efficiently from all hexose and pentose sugars present in the polymers of hemicellulose. by using the same approach, we integrated the pet operon into the chromosome of klebsiella oxytoca to produce strain p2 for use in the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (ssf) process for cellulose. strain p2 has the native ability to ferment cellobiose and cellotriose, eliminating the need for one class of cellulase enzymes. recently, the ability to produce and secrete high levels of endoglucanase has also been added to strain p2, further reducing the requirement for fungal cellulase. the general approach for the genetic engineering of new biocatalysts using the pet operon has been most successful with enteric bacteria but was also extended to gram positive bacteria, which have other useful traits for lignocellulose conversion. many opportunities remain for further improvements in these biocatalysts as we proceed toward the development of single organisms that can be used for the efficient fermentation of both hemicellulosic and cellulosic substrates.

TI  == properties of a cyclodextrin-specific, unusual porin from klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  == the function of cyma, 1 of the 10 gene products involved in cyclodextrin uptake and metabolism by klebsiella oxytoca, was characterized. cyma is essential for growth on cyclodextrins, but it can also complement the deficiency of a lamb (maltoporin) mutant of escherichia coli for growth on linear maltodextrins, indicating that both cyclic and linear oligosaccharides are accepted as substrates. cyma was overproduced in e. coli and purified to apparent homogeneity. cyma is a component of the outer membrane, is processed from a signal peptide-containing precursor, and possesses a high content of antiparallel beta-sheet. incorporation of cyma into lipid bilayers and conductance measurements revealed that it forms ion-permeable channels, which exhibit a substantial current noise. cyma-induced membrane conductance decreased considerably upon addition of alpha-cyclodextrin. titration experiments allowed the calculation of a half-saturation constant, k(s), of 28 microm for its binding to cyma. cyma assembled in vitro to two-dimensionally crystalline tubular membranes, which, on electron microscopy, are characterized by a p1-related two-sided plane group. the crystallographic unit cell contains four monomeric cyma molecules showing a central pore. the lattice parameters are a = 16.1 nm, b  = 3.8 nm, gamma = 93 degrees. cyma does not form trimeric complexes in lipid membranes and shows no tendency to trimerize in solution. cyma thus is an atypical porin with novel properties specialized to transfer cyclodextrins across the outer membrane.

TI  == susceptibility to levofloxacin of clinical isolates of bacteria from intensive care and haematology/oncology patients in switzerland: a multicentre study.
AB  == the objective of this study was to examine the susceptibility of clinical isolates to levofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone with extended activity against gram-positive bacteria, and other antibiotics in 12 swiss clinical microbiology laboratories using the nccls disc diffusion technique. isolates were prospectively collected from intensive care units (icus (59%), oncology wards (7%) and other units with haematology/oncology patients (34%) from june 1995 to march 1996. the levofloxacin breakpoints used were as recommended by the manufacturer. a total of 310 gram-positive and 580 gram-negative isolates from the respiratory tract (36%), skin/wounds (12%), blood (16%), urine (17%) and other sources (19%) were tested. the percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin was 100% for enterococcus spp. (38 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (13), streptococcus pneumoniae (65), acinetobacter spp. (11), citrobacter diversus (6), citrobacter freundii (17), klebsiella oxytoca (39), morganella morganii (16), proteus mirabilis (20), proteus vulgaris (23), serratia spp. (19), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (10) and haemophilus influenzae (41). the percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin for staphylococcus aureus (95  strains, including 2% mrsa) was 94%, coagulase-negative staphylococci (85) 65%, enterobacter spp. (75) 99%, escherichia coli (111) 97%, klebsiella pneumoniae (45) 98% and pseudomonas aeruginosa (124) 87%. in conclusion, levofloxacin is a new fluoroquinolone to which the most common clinical isolates in switzerland are susceptible. the susceptibility of enterococcus spp. and s. pneumoniae to levofloxacin was particularly remarkable. this compound appears to be a promising therapeutic alternative for the treatment of gram-positive infections.

TI  == secretin puld: association with pilot puls, structure, and ion-conducting channel formation.
AB  == the outer membrane protein puld (secretin) of klebsiella oxytoca is required for  transport of pullulanase across this membrane. we have purified a multimeric puld complex from an escherichia coli strain expressing all the proteins involved in pullulanase secretion. the outer membrane-anchored lipoprotein puls was found to  copurify with puld. the molar ratio of the two proteins is close to 1:1, and the  size of the complex is approximately 1 mda. scanning transmission electron and cryo-electron microscopy analyses showed that the purified complex is a cylindrical structure having a central cavity of approximately 7.6 nm and peripheral radial spokes. fusion of proteoliposomes containing the purified complex with a planar lipid bilayer resulted in the appearance of small, voltage-activated, ion-conducting channels. we conclude that the central cavity seen in the electron microscope is part of a large gated channel and propose that the observed current fluctuations correspond to voltage-induced, relatively minor displacements of domains in the purified complex rather than to a complete opening of the secretin channel.

TI  == use of microdilution panels with and without beta-lactamase inhibitors as a phenotypic test for beta-lactamase production among escherichia coli, klebsiella  spp., enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens.
AB  == over the past decade, a number of new beta-lactamases have appeared in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae that, unlike their predecessors, do not confer beta-lactam resistance that is readily detected in routine antibiotic susceptibility tests. because optimal methodologies are needed to detect these important new beta-lactamases, a study was designed to evaluate the ability of a  panel of various beta-lactam antibiotics tested alone and in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors to discriminate between the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, ampc beta-lactamases, high levels of k1 beta-lactamase, and other beta-lactamases in 141 isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens possessing well-characterized beta-lactamases. the microdilution panels studied contained aztreonam, cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone, with and without 1, 2, and 4 microg of clavulanate per ml or 8 microg of sulbactam per ml  and cefoxitin and cefotetan with and without 8 microg of sulbactam per ml. the results indicated that a minimum panel of five tests would provide maximum separation of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase high ampc, high k1, and other beta-lactamase production in enterobacteriaceae. these included cefpodoxime, cefpodoxime plus 4 microg of clavulanate per ml, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and ceftriaxone plus 8 microg of sulbactam per ml. ceftriaxone plus 2 microg of clavulanate per ml could be substituted for cefpodoxime plus 4 microg of clavulanate per ml without altering the accuracy of the tests. this study indicated that tests with key beta-lactam drugs, alone and in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors, could provide a convenient approach to the detection of a variety of beta-lactamases in members of the family enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == characterization and nucleotide sequence of a klebsiella oxytoca cryptic plasmid  encoding a cmy-type beta-lactamase: confirmation that the plasmid-mediated cephamycinase originated from the citrobacter freundii ampc beta-lactamase.
AB  == plasmid ptkh11, originally obtained by electroporation of a klebsiella oxytoca plasmid preparation into escherichia coli xac, expressed a high level of an ampc-like beta-lactamase. the enzyme, designated cmy-5, conferred resistance to extended-spectrum beta-lactams in e. coli; nevertheless, the phenotype was cryptic in the k. oxytoca donor. determination of the complete nucleotide sequence of ptkh11 revealed that the 8,193-bp plasmid encoded seven open reading  frames, including that for the cmy-5 beta-lactamase (blacmy-5). the blacmy-5 product was similar to the plasmidic cmy-2 beta-lactamase of k. pneumoniae and the chromosomal ampc of citrobacter freundii, with 99.7 and 97.0% identities, respectively; there was a substitution of phenylalanine in cmy-5 for isoleucine 105 in cmy-2. blacmy-5 was followed by the blc and suge genes of c. freundii, and this cluster exhibited a genetic organization identical to that of the ampc region on the chromosome of c. freundii; these results confirmed that c. freundii ampc was the evolutionary origin of the plasmidic cephamycinases. in the k. oxytoca host, the copy number of ptkh11 was very low and the plasmid coexisted with plasmid pnbl63. analysis of the replication regions of the two plasmids revealed 97% sequence similarity in the rna i transcripts; this result implied that the two plasmids might be incompatible. incompatibility of the two plasmids  might explain the cryptic phenotype of blacmy-5 in k. oxytoca through an exclusion effect on ptkh11 by resident plasmid pnbl63.

TI  == strength and regulation of the different promoters for chromosomal beta-lactamases of klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  == the two groups of chromosomal beta-lactamases from klebsiella oxytoca (oxy-1 and  oxy-2) can be overproduced 73- to 223-fold, due to point mutations in the consensus sequences of their promoters. the different versions of promoters from  blaoxy-1 and blaoxy-2 were cloned upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene of pkk232-8, and their relative strengths were determined in escherichia coli and in k. oxytoca. the three different mutations in the oxy beta-lactamase promoters resulted in a 4- to 31-fold increase in cat activity compared to that of the wild-type promoter. the g-->t transversion in the first base of the -10 consensus sequence caused a greater increase in the promoter strength of the wild-type promoter than the two other principal mutations (a g-to-a transition of the fifth base of the -10 consensus sequence and a t-to-a transversion of the fourth base of the -35 sequence). the strength of the promoter carrying a double mutation (transition in the pribnow box and the transversion in the -35 hexamer) was increased 15- to 61-fold in comparison to that of the wild-type promoter. a change from 17 to 16 bp between the -35 and -10 consensus sequences resulted in a ninefold decrease of the promoter strength. the expression of the blaoxy promoter in e. coli differs from that in k. oxytoca, particularly for promoters carrying strong mutations. furthermore, the blaoxy promoter appears not to be controlled by dna supercoiling or an upstream curved dna, but it is dependent on the gene copy number.

TI  == characterization of sfo-1, a plasmid-mediated inducible class a beta-lactamase from enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == enterobacter cloacae 8009 produced an inducible class a beta-lactamase which hydrolyzed cefotaxime efficiently. it also hydrolyzed other beta-lactams except cephamycins and carbapenems. the activity was inhibited by clavulanic acid and imipenem. the bla gene was transferable to escherichia coli by electroporation of plasmid dna. the molecular mass of the beta-lactamase was 29 kda and its pi was 7.3. all of these phenotypic characteristics of the enzyme except for inducible production resemble those of some extended-spectrum class a beta-lactamases like  fec-1. the gene encoding this beta-lactamase was cloned and sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequence of the beta-lactamase was homologous to the ampa sequences of the serratia fonticola chromosomal enzyme (96%), men-1 (78%), klebsiella oxytoca chromosomal enzymes (77%), toho-1 (75%), and fec-1 (72%). the  conserved sequences of class a beta-lactamases, including the s-x(t)-x(s)-k motif, in the active site were all conserved in this enzyme. on the basis of the  high degree of homology to the beta-lactamase of s. fonticola, the enzyme was named sfo-1. the ampr gene was located upstream of the ampa gene, and the ampr sequence of sfo-1 had homology with the ampr sequences of the chromosomal beta-lactamases from citrobacter diversus (80%), proteus vulgaris (68%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (60%). sfo-1 was also inducible in e. coli. however, a transformant harboring plasmid without intact ampr produced a small amount of beta-lactamase constitutively, suggesting that ampr works as an activator of ampa of sfo-1. this is the first report from japan describing an inducible plasmid-mediated class a beta-lactamase in gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == a reactivating factor for coenzyme b12-dependent diol dehydratase.
AB  == adenosylcobalamin-dependent diol dehydratase of klebsiella oxytoca undergoes suicide inactivation by glycerol, a physiological substrate. the coenzyme is modified through irreversible cleavage of its cobalt-carbon bond, resulting in inactivation of the enzyme by tight binding of the modified coenzyme to the active site. recombinant ddra and ddrb proteins of k. oxytoca were co-purified to homogeneity from cell-free extracts of escherichia coli overexpressing the ddrab  genes. they existed as a tight complex, i.e. a putative reactivating factor, with an apparent molecular weight of 150,000. the factor consists of equimolar amounts of the two subunits with mr of 64,000 (a) and 14,000 (b), encoded by the ddra and ddrb genes, respectively. therefore, its subunit structure is most likely a2b2. the factor not only reactivated glycerol-inactivated and o2-inactivated holoenzymes but also activated enzyme-cyanocobalamin complex in the presence of free adenosylcobalamin, atp, and mg2+. the reactivating factor mediated atp-dependent exchange of the enzyme-bound cyanocobalamin for free 5-adeninylpentylcobalamin in the presence of atp and mg2+, but the reverse was not the case. thus, it can be concluded that the inactivated holoenzyme becomes reactivated by exchange of the enzyme-bound, adenine-lacking cobalamins for free  adenosylcobalamin, an adenine-containing cobalamin.

TI  == recombinant klebsiella oxytoca strains with improved efficiency in removal of high nitrate loads
AB  == klebsiella oxytoca cect 4460 removes high nitrate loads from industrial wastewaters without accumulation of nitrite under optimal culture conditions; however, under nonoptimal conditions nitrite accumulates. this situation reflects an in vivo-limited functioning of nitrite reductase in this strain. as a way to overcome this limitation, an increase in the nitrite reductase gene dose in k. oxytoca cect 4460 was considered. to achieve this, we cloned and transferred into this strain the klebsiella pneumoniae nasb gene, which encodes assimilatory nitrite reductase (lin et al., j. bacteriol. 176:2551-2559, 1994). the delivery vector was either the wide-host-range plasmid pupe2, in which the nasb gene is expressed from the escherichia coli plac promoter, or a mini-tn5-km vector, which upon random insertion in the host chromosome allowed expression of the nasb gene  from an unidentified chromosomal host promoter. the effect of the increase in the dose of the nasb gene in k. oxytoca cect 4460 on the accumulation of nitrite in the culture medium was tested in two recombinant strains. the results obtained showed that k. oxytoca cect 4460 bearing pupe2 accumulated 88% less nitrite than  the wild-type strain, while the recombinant strain bearing the k. pneumoniae nasb gene in the host chromosome showed a 25% lower level of nitrite accumulation in the culture medium than that of the wild type.

TI  == gyra mutations associated with fluoroquinolone resistance in eight species of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == fluoroquinolone resistance (fq-r) in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae species has been reported with increasing frequency in recent years. two mechanisms of fq-r have been identified in gram-negative organisms: mutations in  dna gyrase and reduced intracellular drug accumulation. a single point mutation in gyra has been shown to reduce susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. to determine the extent of gyra mutations associated with fq-r in enteric bacteria, one set of oligonucleotide primers was selected from conserved sequences in the flanking regions of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdr) of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. this set of primers was used to amplify and sequence the qrdrs from 8 enterobacteriaceae type strains and 60 fluoroquinolone-resistant clinical isolates of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, providencia stuartii, and serratia marcescens. although similarity of the nucleotide sequences of seven species ranged from 80.8 to 93.3%, when compared with that of e. coli, the amino acid sequences of the gyra qrdr were highly conserved. conservative amino acid substitutions were detected in the qrdrs of the susceptible type strains of c. freundii, e. aerogenes, k. oxytoca (ser-83 to  thr), and p. stuartii (asp-87 to glu). strains with ciprofloxacin mics of >2 microg/ml expressed amino acid substitutions primarily at the gly-81, ser-83, or  asp-87 position. fluoroquinolone mics varied significantly for strains exhibiting identical gyra mutations, indicating that alterations outside gyra contribute to  resistance. the type and position of amino acid alterations also differed among these six genera. high-level fq-r frequently was associated with single gyra mutations in all species of enterobacteriaceae in this study except e. coli.

TI  == can results obtained with commercially available microscan microdilution panels serve as an indicator of beta-lactamase production among escherichia coli and klebsiella isolates with hidden resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and aztreonam?
AB  == among clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and klebsiella oxytoca, there is an ever-increasing prevalence of beta-lactamases that may confer resistance to newer beta-lactam antibiotics that is not detectable by conventional procedures. therefore, 75 isolates of these species producing well-characterized beta-lactamases were studied using two microscan conventional microdilution panels, gram negative urine mic 7 (nu7) and gram negative mic plus 2 (n+2), to determine if results could be utilized to provide an accurate indication of beta-lactamase production in the absence of frank resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and aztreonam. the enzymes studied included bush groups 1 (ampc), 2b (tem-1, tem-2, and shv-1), 2be (extended spectrum beta-lactamases [esbls] and k1), and 2br, alone and in various combinations. in tests with e. coli and k. pneumoniae and the nu7 panel, cefpodoxime mics of >/=2 microg/ml were obtained only for isolates producing esbls or ampc beta-lactamases. cefoxitin mics of >16 microg/ml were obtained for  all strains producing ampc beta-lactamase and only 1 of 33 strains producing esbls. for the n+2 panel, ceftazidime mics of >/=4 microg/ml correctly identified 90% of esbl producers and 100% of ampc producers among isolates of e. coli and k. pneumoniae. cefotetan mics of >/= 8 microg/ml were obtained for seven of eight producers of ampc beta-lactamase and no esbl producers. for tests performed with  either panel and isolates of k. oxytoca, mics of ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and ceftizoxime were elevated for strains producing esbls, while ceftriaxone and aztreonam mics separated low-level k1 from high-level k1 producers within this species. these results suggest that microdilution panels can be used by clinical  laboratories as an indicator of certain beta-lactamases that may produce hidden but clinically significant resistance among isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and k. oxytoca. although it may not always be possible to differentiate between strains that produce esbls and those that produce ampc, this differentiation is not critical since therapeutic options for patients infected with such organisms  are similarly limited.

AB  == radiolabeled linear and cyclic maltodextrins of high specific radioactivity were  prepared using enzymes involved in maltodextrin metabolism. 14c-labeled maltose was the starting material yielding products of identical specific radioactivity with respect to glucosyl residues. the enzymatic steps involved: i) formation of  linear 14c-labeled maltodexrins (< maltooctaose) using amylomaltase from escherischia coli; ii) cyclisation to alpha-cyclodextrin using cyclodextrin-glucosyltransferase of kiebsiella oxytoca m5a1; iii) removal of the  remaining linear dextrins by amyloglucosidase. the products were purified by paper chromatography, or maltohexaose was specifically obtained from purified alpha-cyclodextrin by the action of cyclodextrinase of k. oxytoca m5a1.

TI  == macromolecular assembly and secretion across the bacterial cell envelope: type ii protein secretion systems.
AB  == a decade ago, pugsley and colleagues reported the existence of a large region of  klebsiella dna, distinct from the klebsiella gene encoding pullulanase, which was necessary for secretion of this enzyme to the cell surface in escherichia coli (d'enfert et al., 1987a,b). the pul genes it contained proved to be the tip of an iceberg. the sequences reported before 1992 (d'enfert et al., 1987a,b; d'enfert & pugsley, 1989; pugsley & reyss, 1990; reyss & pugsley, 1990) included only one gene (puld) that matched any sequence in the data base; a 220 amino acid residue  segment of puld was 32% identical with a portion of the filamentous phage-encoded protein, piv. but by the time the sequence of the 18.8 kb dna fragment that contained the pul genes had been completed (possot et al., 1992), reports of sets of homologous genes in several species of gram-negative plant and animal pathogens had appeared. for the most part, these gene clusters were cloned by their ability to complement mutants that produced, but failed to secrete, proteins normally found in the extracellular milieu; when tested, the mutants showed reduced pathogenicity or were totally avirulent. the secreted proteins included hydrolytic enzymes such as cellulase and pectinase from plant pathogens, and proteases and toxins from animal pathogens. the multi-gene family necessary for secretion of these enzymes is now known as the type ii system or the main terminal branch (mtb) of the general secretion pathway (gsp). as summarized by pugsley et al. (1997), the current tally includes type ii systems from klebsiella oxytoca (pul), erwinia chrysanthemi and carotovora (out), xanthomonas campestris  (xps), pseudomonas aeruginosa (xcp), aeromonas hydrophila (exe), and vibrio cholerae (eps). a second type ii system (sps) necessary for deposition of the s-layer on the cell surface in a. hydrophila is more similar to the x. campestris than a. hydrophila genes (thomas & trust, 1995). the biggest surprise has been the discovery of a complete set of type ii secretion genes in e. coli k12. the e. coli genes are not expressed under normal growth conditions, and a search is underway to find inducing conditions and secretion substrates (francetic & pugsley, 1996). impressive progress has already been made in defining components  of the pathway. what remains to be understood in mechanistic detail is how this protein secretion system functions.

TI  == the periplasmic cyclodextrin binding protein cyme from klebsiella oxytoca and its role in maltodextrin and cyclodextrin transport.
AB  == klebsiella oxytoca m5a1 has the capacity to transport and to metabolize alpha-, beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins. cyclodextrin transport is mediated by the products of the cyme, cymf, cymg, cymd, and cyma genes, which are functionally homologous  to the male, malf, malg, malk, and lamb gene products of escherichia coli. cyme,  which is the periplasmic binding protein, has been overproduced and purified. by  substrate-induced fluorescence quenching, the binding of ligands was analyzed. cyme bound alpha-cyclodextrin, beta-cyclodextrin, and gamma-cyclodextrin, with dissociation constants (kd) of 0.02, 0.14 and 0.30 microm, respectively, and linear maltoheptaose, with a kd of 70 microm. in transport experiments, alpha-cyclodextrin was taken up by the cym system of k. oxytoca three to five times less efficiently than maltohexaose by the e. coli maltose system. besides alpha-cyclodextrin, maltohexaose was also taken up by the k. oxytoca cym system,  but because of the inability of maltodextrins to induce the cym system, growth of e. coli mal mutants on linear maltodextrin was not observed when the cells harbored only the cym uptake system. strains which gained this capacity by mutation could easily be selected, however.

TI  == epidemiology of klebsiella bacteraemia: a case control study using escherichia coli bacteraemia as control.
AB  == epidemiological data from 117 episodes of klebsiella bacteraemia were compared with those from matched controls with escherichia coli bacteraemia. cases and controls were obtained from 20,631 blood cultures taken from patients in hvidovre hospital between 1990 and 1992. the data studied included: sex and age, risk factors, portal of entry, outcome, nosocomial acquisition and distribution within the hospital. the incidence of klebsiella bacteraemia was 9.3/10,000 admissions (76% klebsiella pneumoniae; 24% klebsiella oxytoca). patients with klebsiella and e. coli bacteraemia had many common features, including a high incidence of neoplastic disease, biliary tract disease, and renal failure. many had undergone  surgery or received therapy with steroids, antacids or antibiotics. klebsiella bacteraemia was more often found in males, in patients with hospital contact within the previous month, and polymicrobial infection. logistic regression analysis showed that use of invasive plastic devices and diabetes were significantly associated with klebsiella bacteraemia. the urinary tract was the commonest source, followed by the biliary tract; 27% of patients had no obvious focus of infection, and in many of these an invasive device may have been involved. forty-five k-serotypes were found--the largest number being nine strains of type k3; only a few strains had acquired resistance characters to antimicrobial agents. there were no differences between community- and hospital-acquired strains; indicating that our hospital does not have a resident  strain of klebsiella.

TI  == a second prepilin peptidase gene in escherichia coli k-12.
AB  == escherichia coli k-12 strains grown at 37 degrees c or 42 degrees c, but not at 30 degrees c, process the precursors of the neisseria gonorrhoeae type iv pilin pile and the klebsiella oxytoca type iv pseudopilin pulg in a manner reminiscent  of the prepilin peptidase-dependent processing of these proteins that occurs in these bacteria. processing of prepulg in escherichia coli requires a glycine at position -1, as does processing by the cognate prepilin peptidase (pulo), and is  unaffected by mutations that inactivate several non-specific proteases. these data suggested that e. coli k-12 has a functional prepilin peptidase, despite the fact that it does not itself appear to express either type iv pilin or pseudopilin genes under the conditions that allow prepile and prepulg processing. the e. coli k-12 genome contains two genes encoding proteins with significant sequence similarity to prepilin peptidases: gspo at minute 74.5 and pppa (f310c)  at minute 67 on the genetic map. we have previously obtained evidence that gspo encodes an active enzyme but is not transcribed. pppa was cloned and shown to code for a functional prepilin peptidase capable of processing typical prepilin peptidase substrates. inactivation of pppa eliminated the endogenous, thermoinducible prepilin peptidase activity. pppa was able to replace pulo prepilin peptidase in a pullulanase secretion system reconstituted in e. coli when expressed from high-copy-number plasmids but not when present in a single chromosomal copy. the analysis of pppa-lacz fusions indicated that pppa expression was very low and regulated by the growth temperature at the level of translation, in agreement with the observed temperature dependence of pppa activity. polymerase chain reaction and southern hybridization analyses revealed  the presence of the pppa gene in 12 out of 15 e. coli isolates.

TI  == high affinity binding of albicidin phytotoxins by the alba protein from klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  == albicidins are a family of phytotoxins and antibiotics which play an important role in the pathogenesis of sugarcane leaf scald disease. the alba gene from klebsiella oxytoca encodes a protein which inactivates albicidin by heat-reversible binding. albicidin ligand binding to a recombinant alba protein,  purified by means of a glutathione s-transferase gene fusion system, is an almost instant and saturable reaction. kinetic and stoichiometric analysis of the binding reaction indicated the presence of a single high affinity binding site with a dissociation constant of 6.4 x 10(-8) m. the alba-albicidin complex is stable from 4 to 40 degrees c, from ph 5 to 9 and in high salt solutions. treatment with protein denaturants released all bound albicidin. these properties indicate that alba may be a useful affinity matrix for selective purification of  albicidin antibiotics. alba does not bind to p-nitrophenyl butyrate or alpha-naphthyl butyrate, the substrates of the albicidin detoxification enzyme albd from pantoea dispersa. the potential exists to pyramid genes for different mechanisms in transgenic plants to protect plastid dna replication from inhibition by albicidins.

TI  == in vitro activity of fosfomycin trometamol against pathogens from urinary tract infections: a spanish multicenter study.
AB  == the in-vitro susceptibilities of a total of 1371 urinary tract pathogens to fosfomycin trometamol were determined. according to the nccls breakpoints, enterobacteriaceae and gram-positive microorganisms were, in general, very sensitive to this antimicrobial. more than 90.0% of the escherichia coli and citrobacter spp. and more than 70.0% of the klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, enterobacter spp., proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococcus spp. strains tested were susceptible to fosfomycin trometamol. however, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. strains were more resistant. in general, recent clinical isolates from urinary tract infections (utis) in both community and hospital were also very sensitive (> 80.0%) to fosfomycin, its activity being higher than that of the rest of the antimicrobials commonly used for therapy of uncomplicated utis. more than 75.0% of the most frequently isolated pathogens from utis, except for p. aeruginosa (31.8%) and acinetobacter spp. (11.1%), were susceptible to fosfomycin trometamol. the results obtained in this study, together with the infrequency of  side effects and its pharmacokinetic properties, indicate that fosfomycin trometamol may be a useful alternative for single-dose therapy of uncomplicated utis.

TI  == characterization, sequencing, and expression of the genes encoding a reactivating factor for glycerol-inactivated adenosylcobalamin-dependent diol dehydratase.
AB  == diol dehydratase undergoes suicide inactivation by glycerol during catalysis involving irreversible cleavage of the co-c bond of adenosylcobalamin. in permeabilized klebsiella oxytoca and klebsiella pneumoniae cells, the glycerol-inactivated holoenzyme or the enzyme-cyanocobalamin complex is rapidly activated by the exchange of the inactivated coenzyme or cyanocobalamin for free  adenosylcobalamin in the presence of atp and mg2+ (honda, s., toraya, t., and fukui, s. (1980) j. bacteriol. 143, 1458-1465; ushio, k., honda, s., toraya, t.,  and fukui, s. (1982) j. nutr. sci. vitaminol. 28, 225-236). permeabilized escherichia coli cells co-expressing the diol dehydratase genes with two open reading frames in the 3'-flanking region were capable of reactivating glycerol-inactivated diol dehydratase as well as activating the enzyme-cyanocobalamin complex in situ in the presence of free adenosylcobalamin,  atp, and mg2+. these open reading frames, designated as ddra and ddrb genes, were identified as the genes of a putative reactivating factor for inactivated diol dehydratase. the genes encoded polypeptides consisting of 610 and 125 amino acid  residues with predicted molecular weights of 64,266 and 13,620, respectively. co-expression of the open reading frame in the 5'-flanking region was stimulatory but not obligatory for conferring the reactivating activity upon e. coli. thus, the product of this gene was considered not an essential component of the reactivating factor.

TI  == isolation and molecular characterization of high-performance cellobiose-fermenting spontaneous mutants of ethanologenic escherichia coli ko11  containing the klebsiella oxytoca casab operon.
AB  == escherichia coli ko11 was previously constructed to produce ethanol from acid hydrolysates of hemicellulose (pentoses and hexoses) by the chromosomal integration of zymomonas mobilis genes encoding pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) and  alcohol dehydrogenase (adhb). klebsiella oxytoca p2 was constructed in an analogous fashion for the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of cellulose and contains pts enzymes for cellobiose. in this study, ko11 was further engineered for the fermentation of cellulose by adding the k. oxytoca casab genes encoding enzyme iicellobiose and phospho-beta-glucosidase. although the two k. oxytoca genes were well expressed in cloning hosts such as dh5 alpha,  both were expressed poorly in e. coli ko11, a derivative of e. coli b. spontaneous mutants which exhibited more than 15-fold-higher specific activities  for cellobiose metabolism were isolated. the mutations of these mutants resided in the plasmid rather than the host. three mutants were characterized by sequence analysis. all contained similar internal deletions which eliminated the casab promoter and operator regions and placed the lacz shine-dalgarno region immediately upstream from the casa shine-dalgarno region. ko11 harboring mutant plasmids (ploi1908, ploi1909, or ploi1910) rapidly fermented cellobiose to ethanol, and the yield was more than 90% of the theoretical yield. two of these strains were used with commercial cellulase to ferment mixed-waste office paper to ethanol.

TI  == characterization of the pena and penr genes of burkholderia cepacia 249 which encode the chromosomal class a penicillinase and its lysr-type transcriptional regulator.
AB  == burkholderia cepacia is recognized as an important pathogen in the lung infections of patients with cystic fibrosis. an inducible beta-lactamase activity has been associated with increased resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in clinical isolates of b. cepacia. in this study, we report the revised sequence of the pena gene, which encodes the inducible penicillinase of b. cepacia, and show  that it belongs to the molecular class a beta-lactamases and exhibits a high degree of similarity to the chromosomal beta-lactamase of klebsiella oxytoca. analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the dna region directly upstream of the pena coding sequence revealed an open reading frame (penr), the transcription of  which was oriented opposite to that of pena and whose initiation was 130 bp away  from that of pena. two potential ribosome-binding sites and two overlapping -10 and -35 promoter sequences were identified in the intercistronic region. the predicted translation product of penr was a polypeptide of 301 amino acids with an estimated molecular size of 33.2 kda. the deduced polypeptide of penr showed a high degree of similarity with ampr-like transcriptional activators of class a and c beta-lactamases, with identities of 59 and 58.7% with pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 ampr and proteus vulgaris b317 cumr, respectively. the n-terminal portion of b. cepacia penr was predicted to include a helix-turn-helix motif, which may bind the lysr motif identified in the intercistronic region. induction  of pena by imipenem was shown to be dependent upon the presence of penr. expression of the cloned b. cepacia pena and penr genes in escherichia coli sno302 (ampd) resulted in a high basal and hyperinducible pena activity. these results suggest that the regulation of the pena penicillinase of b. cepacia 249 is similar to that observed in other class a and class c beta-lactamases that are under the control of a divergently transcribed ampr-like regulator.

TI  == a protein factor is essential for in situ reactivation of glycerol-inactivated adenosylcobalamin-dependent diol dehydratase.
AB  == the adenosylcobalamin-dependent diol dehydratase of klebsiella oxytoca undergoes  suicidal inactivation by glycerol during catalysis involving irreversible dissociation of the co-c bond of the coenzyme. the glycerol-inactivated holoenzyme in permeabilized cells (in situ) of e. coli harboring a plasmid containing the diol dehydratase genes and their flanking regions was rapidly reactivated in the presence of free adocbl, atp, and mg2+. beta,gamma-methylene atp was not able to replace atp. inactive complexes of the enzyme with aqcbl, cn-cbl, and pecbl were activated in situ in the presence of adocbl, atp, and mg2+, but the complex with adepecbl was not. these results suggest that the inactivated holoenzyme is reactivated in situ in the presence of atp and mg2+ by  exchange of the inactivated coenzyme lacking the adenine moiety for free intact adocbl. the in situ reactivation was also observed when an analog lacking the alpha-ribose moiety of the nucleotide loop was used as coenzyme. the results with a recombinant e. coli strains carrying a deletion mutant plasmid demonstrate that certain protein(s) encoded by the 3'-flanking region of the diol dehydratase genes are essential for the in situ reactivation of inactivated diol dehydratase.

TI  == heterologous expression, purification, and properties of diol dehydratase, an adenosylcobalamin-dependent enzyme of klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  == recombinant adenosylcobalamin-dependent diol dehydratase of klebsiella oxytoca overexpressed in escherichia coli was purified to homogeneity. the enzyme has a low solubility and was extracted from the crude membrane fraction with 1% brij 35 in a high recovery. subsequent chromatography on deae-cellulose resulted in 4.9-fold purification of the enzyme in an overall yield of 65%. the enzyme thus obtained showed specific activity comparable to that of the wild-type enzyme of k. oxytoca. the apparent molecular weight determined by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis on a gradient gel was 220,000. the enzyme consists of equimolar amounts of the three subunits with apparent mr of 60,000 (alpha), 30,000 (beta),  and 19,000 (gamma). therefore, the subunit structure of the enzyme is most likely alpha2beta2gamma2. the recombinant enzyme was also separated into components f and s upon deae-cellulose chromatography in the absence of substrate. components  f and s were identified as the beta subunit and alpha2gamma2 complex, respectively. apparent km for adenosylcobalamin, 1,2-propanediol, glycerol, and 1,2-ethanediol were 0.83 microm, 0.08 mm, 0.73 mm, and 0.56 mm, respectively. the three genes encoding the subunits of diol dehydratase were overexpressed individually or in various combinations in escherichia coli. the alpha and gamma  subunits mutually required each other for correct folding forming the soluble, active alpha2gamma2 complex (component s). expression of the beta subunit in a soluble, active form (component f) was promoted by coexpression with both the alpha and gamma subunits, probably by coexistence with component s. these lines of evidence indicate that each subunit mutually affects the folding of the others in this heterooligomer enzyme.

TI  == comparison of screening methods for detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and their prevalence among blood isolates of escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. in a belgian teaching hospital.
AB  == using a set of 33 well-defined extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing  strains of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, we compared three screening methods for esbl detection: (i) a double-disk synergy test, (ii) a three-dimensional test (both the double-disk synergy test and the three-dimensional test were performed with ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and cefepime), and (iii) the etest esbl screen (ab biodisk, solna, sweden), based on the recognition of a reduction in the ceftazidime mic in the presence of clavulanic acid. in the double-disk test, all four indicator antibiotics scored equally and 31 of the 33 reference strains were recognized. in the three-dimensional test, ceftriaxone was the only satisfactory indicator and 30 esbl-positive strains were detected by this antibiotic. both systems produced two false-positive results with cefepime. with the etest esbl screen, 15 of 16 tem-related and 11 of 16 shv-related esbl-producing strains scored positive. in 10 cases the clavulanic acid on one end of the strip interfered with the mic determination for ceftazidime, which was read on the opposite end. this mic had to be determined with an extra ceftazidime-only strip. no false-positive results  were noted. eighty-six blood isolates of e. coli and klebsiella species were screened for esbl expression by the double-disk and three-dimensional tests, both with ceftriaxone. six strains with suspicious antibiogram phenotypes also gave positive results by the double-disk test. one e. coli strain remained undetected  by the three-dimensional test. identification of the enzymes suspected of being esbls by isoelectric focusing (all strains) and dna sequencing (1 strain) confirmed the screening test results except for one klebsiella oxytoca strain, which proved to be a hyperproducer of its chromosomal enzyme and which also had a negative etest score. the five true esbl producers were all confirmed by the etest esbl screen. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis proved that the e. coli strains were unrelated, but that two of the three k. pneumoniae strains were closely related.

TI  == characteristics of alcohol dehydrogenases of certain aerobic bacteria representing human colonic flora.
AB  == we have recently proposed the existence of a bacteriocolonic pathway for ethanol  oxidation [i.e., ethanol is oxidized by alcohol dehydrogenases (adhs) of intestinal bacteria resulting in high intracolonic levels of reactive and toxic acetaldehyde]. the aim of this in vitro study was to characterize further adh activity of some aerobic bacteria, representing the normal human colonic flora. these bacteria were earlier shown to possess high cytosolic adh activities (escherichia coli ih 133369, klebsiella pneumoniae ih 35385, klebsiella oxytoca ih 35339, pseudomonas aeruginosa ih 35342, and hafnia alvei ih 53227). adhs of the tested bacteria strongly preferred nad as a cofactor. marked adh activities were found in all bacteria, even at low ethanol concentrations (1.5 mm) that may  occur in the colon due to bacterial fermentation. the km for ethanol varied from  29.9 mm for k. pneumoniae to 0.06 mm for hafnia alvei. the inhibition of adh by 4-methylpyrazole was found to be of the competitive type in 4 of 5 bacteria, and  ki varied from 18.26 +/- 3.3 mm for escherichia coli to 0.47 +/- 0.13 mm for k. pneumoniae. at ph 7.4, adh activity was significantly lower than at ph 9.6 in four bacterial strains. adh of k. oxytoca, however, showed almost equal activities at neutral ph and at 9.6. in conclusion, nad-linked alcohol dehydrogenases of aerobic colonic bacteria possess low apparent km's for ethanol. accordingly, they may oxidize moderate amounts of ethanol ingested during social  drinking with nearly maximal velocity. this may result in the marked production of intracolonic acetaldehyde. kinetic characteristics of the bacterial enzymes may enable some of them to produce acetaldehyde even from endogenous ethanol formed by other bacteria via alcoholic fermentation. the microbial adhs were inhibited by 4-methylpyrazole by the same competitive inhibition as hepatic adh,  however, with nearly 1000 times lower susceptibility. individual variations in human colonic flora may thus contribute to the risk of alcohol-related gastrointestinal morbidity, such as diarrhea, colon polyps and cancer, and liver  injury.

TI  == extracellular melibiose and fructose are intermediates in raffinose catabolism during fermentation to ethanol by engineered enteric bacteria.
AB  == contrary to general concepts of bacterial saccharide metabolism, melibiose (25 to 32 g/liter) and fructose (5 to 14 g/liter) accumulated as extracellular intermediates during the catabolism of raffinose (o-alpha-d-galactopyranosyl-1, 6-alpha-d-glucopyranosyl-beta-d-fructofuranoside) (90 g/liter) by ethanologenic recombinants of escherichia coli b, klebsiella oxytoca m5a1, and erwinia chrysanthemi ec16. both hydrolysis products (melibiose and fructose) were subsequently transported and further metabolized by all three organisms. raffinose catabolism was initiated by beta-fructosidase; melibiose was subsequently hydrolyzed to galactose and glucose by alpha-galactosidase. glucose  and fructose were completely metabolized by all three organisms, but galactose accumulated in the fermentation broth with ec16(ploi555) and p2. mm2 (a raffinose-positive e. coli mutant) was the most effective biocatalyst for ethanol production (38 g/liter) from raffinose. all organisms rapidly fermented sucrose (90 g/liter) to ethanol (48 g/liter) at more than 90% of the theoretical yield. during sucrose catabolism, both hydrolysis products (glucose and fructose) were metabolized concurrently by ec16(ploi555) and p2 without sugar leakage. however,  fructose accumulated extracellularly (27 to 28 g/liter) at early stages of fermentation with ko11 and mm2. sequential utilization of glucose and fructose correlated with a diauxie in base utilization (ph maintenance). the mechanism of  sugar escape remains unknown but may involve downhill leakage via permease which  transports precursor saccharides or novel sugar export proteins. if sugar escape  occurs in nature with wild organisms, it could facilitate the development of complex bacterial communities which are based on the sequence of saccharide catabolism and the hierarchy of sugar utilization.

AB  == the bacteria klebsiella oxytoca lmd 72.65 (atcc 8724), arthrobacter p1 lmd 81.60  (ncib 11625), paracoccus versutus lmd 80.62 (atcc 25364), escherichia coli w lmd  50.28 (atcc 9637), e. coli k12 lmd 93.68, pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 lmd 89.1 (atcc 17933) and pseudomonas putida lmd 68.20 (atcc 12633) utilized primary amines as a carbon and energy source, although the range of amines accepted varied from organism to organism. the gram-negative bacteria k. oxytoca and e. coli as well as the gram-positive methylotroph arthrobacter p1 used an oxidase whereas the pseudomonads and the gram-negative methylotroph paracoccus versutus used a dehydrogenase for amine oxidation. k. oxytoca utilized several primary amines but showed a preference for those containing a phenyl group moiety. only a single oxidase was used for oxidation of the amines. after purification, the following characteristics of the enzyme indicated that it belonged to the group of copper-quinoprotein amine oxidase (ec 1.4.3.6): the molecular mass (172,000 da) of the homodimeric protein; the uv/visible and epr spectra of isolated and p-nitrophenylhydrazine-inhibited enzyme; the presence and the content of copper and topaquinone (tpq). the amine oxidase appeared to be soluble and localized in  the periplasm, but catalase and nad-dependent aromatic aldehyde dehydrogenase, enzymes catalysing the conversion of its reaction products, were found in the cytoplasm. from the amino acid sequence of the n-terminal part as well as that of a purified peptide, it appears that k. oxytoca produces a copper-quinoprotein oxidase which is very similar to that found in other enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == cloning of cellobiose phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase genes: functional expression in recombinant escherichia coli and identification of a putative binding region for disaccharides.
AB  == genomic libraries from nine cellobiose-metabolizing bacteria were screened for cellobiose utilization. positive clones were recovered from six libraries, all of which encode phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (pts) proteins. clones from bacillus subtilis, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and klebsiella oxytoca allowed the growth of recombinant escherichia coli in cellobiose-m9 minimal medium. the k. oxytoca clone, ploi1906, exhibited an unusually broad substrate range (cellobiose, arbutin, salicin, and methylumbelliferyl derivatives of glucose, cellobiose, mannose, and xylose) and was sequenced. the insert in this plasmid encoded the carboxy-terminal region of  a putative regulatory protein, cellobiose permease (single polypeptide), and phospho-beta-glucosidase, which appear to form an operon (casrab). subclones allowed both casa and casb to be expressed independently, as evidenced by in vitro complementation. an analysis of the translated sequences from the eiic domains of cellobiose, aryl-beta-glucoside, and other disaccharide permeases allowed the identification of a 50-amino-acid conserved region. a disaccharide consensus sequence is proposed for the most conserved segment (13 amino acids), which may represent part of the eiic active site for binding and phosphorylation.

TI  == production of escherichia coli group i-like heat-labile enterotoxin by enterobacteriaceae isolated from environmental water.
AB  == strains of klebsiella oxytoca (2), citrobacter freundii (2), enterobacter cloacae (1) and escherichia coli (1) isolated from environmental water were identified as heat-labile enterotoxin (lt) producing strains by immunological methods and polymerase chain amplification. a 322 bp amplified fragment was obtained with specific primers ltr and ltl, and hybridized to a digoxigenin-labelled ltb probe  only under low stringency conditions, and not with a cholera toxin probe. these results suggest that enterobacteriaceae may produce a lt-like toxin antigenically and genetically related to the lt enterotoxin of e. coli.

TI  == the secretin-specific, chaperone-like protein of the general secretory pathway: separation of proteolytic protection and piloting functions.
AB  == the chaperone-like protein of the main terminal branch of the general secretory pathway from klebsiella oxytoca, the outer membrane lipoprotein puls, protects the multimeric secretin puld from degradation and promotes its correct localization to the outer membrane. to determine whether these are separable functions, or whether resistance to proteolysis results simply from correct localization of puld, we replaced the lipoprotein-type signal peptide of puls by  the signal peptide of periplasmic maltose-binding protein. the resulting periplasmic puls retained its ability to protect puld, but not its ability to localize puld to the outer membrane and to function in pullulanase secretion. periplasmic puls competed with wild-type puls to prevent pullulanase secretion, presumably again by causing mislocalization of puld. a hybrid protein comprising  the mature part of puls fused to the c-terminus of full-length maltose-binding protein (male-puls) had similar properties to the periplasmic puls protein. moreover, male-puls was shown to associate with puld by amylose-affinity chromatography. the male-puls hybrid was rendered completely functional (i.e. it  restored pullulanase secretion in a puls mutant) by replacing its signal peptide  with a lipoprotein-type signal peptide. however, this fattyacylated hybrid protein was only functional if it also carried a lipoprotein sorting signal that  targeted it to the outer membrane. thus, the two functions of puls are separate and fully dissociable. incorrect localization, rather than proteolysis, of puld in the absence of puls was shown to be the factor that causes high-level induction of the phage shock response. the erwinia chrysanthemi puls homologue, outs, can substitute for puls, and puls can protect the secretin outd from proteolysis in escherichia coli, indicating the possible existence of a family of puls-like chaperone proteins.

TI  == detection of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing members of the family enterobacteriaceae with vitek esbl test.
AB  == a three-phase analysis of the vitek esbl test and a double-disk (2 disk) test was performed to assess their ability to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in members of the family enterobacteriaceae. in the first two phases involving detection of esbls in 157 stains processing well-characterized beta-lactamases, sensitivity and specificity were found to be 99.5 and 100%, respectively, for the vitek esbl test and 98.1 and 99.4%, respectively, for the 2-disk test. in the third phase, in which the ability of each test to detect esbls in 295 clinical isolates was assessed, there was only one false positive (vitek esbl test). across all three phases, the vitek esbl test was found to be much easier to perform than the 2-disk test. the latter also involved subjective  interpretation of results. there were a total of 176 escherichia coli and 157 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates and less than 40 isolates of each of 14 other species evaluated. in a supplemental study of klebsiella oxytoca, an organism possessing a chromosomal beta-lactamase similar to an esbl, the vitek esbl test was found to be capable of detecting hyperproduction of this enzyme in strains of this species as well. these data indicate that the vitek esbl test is reliable for the detection of esbls in e. coli and k. pneumoniae, the two species in which esbls are most common, and of hyperproduction of the k. oxytoca beta-lactamase, a situation which engenders a level of resistance to this species similar to that seen with esbls.

AB  == objectives: antibiotic susceptibility of 649 gram-negative bacilli involved in severe infections and isolated in 18 teaching hospitals from january to december  1992 was evaluated. methods: minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by agar dilution method for piperacillin, piperacillin+ tazobactam and imipenem, and by a microdilution method for 11 other antibiotics (amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, ticarcillin, ciprofloxacin,  fosfomycin, tobramycin, gentamicin, amikacin). criteria of comite francais de l'antibiogramme de la societe francaise de microbiologie were followed for interpretation. betalactamases were identified by isoelectric focusing and overproduction of cephalosporinase was defined by the resistance phenotype. the main species isolated were escherichia coli (45%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (14%),  klebsiella pneumoniae (7.8%), salmonella spp. (7.5%), enterobacter cloacae (4%) and klebsiella oxytoca (4%). most of the strains were isolated from blood culture (72.3%), respiratory tract (11.4%) and intraabdominal infections (8.6%). most of  the enterobacteria isolates were susceptible to imipenem, aztreonam, amikacin and ciprofloxacin (percentages of susceptibility were respectively 99.3, 98, 98.3 and 96.3); in most of cases clavulanic acid did not entirely restore sensitivity to amoxicillin of penicillinase-producing strains. among 89 p. aeruginosa strains, 82% were susceptible to imipenem and ceftazidime, 81% to the association piperacillin + tazobactam and 51% to ticarcillin. resistance rates are very high  for acinetobacter baumannii except for imipenem. conclusion: production of tem-type penicillinase and over-production of the chromosomal cephalosporinase are the most widely observed mechanisms of resistance (respectively 22% and 9% of 649 strains). prevalence of extended spectrum betalactamases was low (1%) and essentially observed for k. pneumoniae.

TI  == extracellular production of a serratia marcescens serine protease in escherichia  coli.
AB  == the serratia marcescens serine protease (ssp) is one of the extracellular enzymes secreted from this gram-negative bacterium. when the ssp gene, which encodes a ssp precursor (preprossp) composed of a typical nh2-terminal signal peptide, a mature enzyme domain, and a large cooh-terminal pro-region, is expressed in escherichia coli, the mature protease is excreted through the outer membrane into the medium. the cooh-terminal pro-region, which is integrated into the outer membrane, provides the essential function for the export of the mature protein across the outer membrane. this is a very simple pathway, in contrast to the general secretory pathway exemplified by the secretion of a pullulanase from klebsiella oxytoca, in which many separately encoded accessory proteins are required for the transport through the outer membrane. moreover, the nh2-terminal region of 71 amino acid residues of the cooh-terminal pro-sequence plays an essential role, as an "intramolecular chaperone," in the folding of the mature enzyme in the medium. in addition to ssp, the s. marcescens strain contains two ssp homologues encoding proteins similar to ssp in amino acid sequence and size,  but with no protease activity. characterization of the homologue proteins and chimeric proteins between the homologues and ssp, all of which are produced in e. coli, has shown that they are membrane proteins that are localized in the outer membrane in the same manner as for ssp. by use of the cooh-terminal domain of ssp, pseudoazurin was exported to the cell surface of e. coli, which proves the usefulness of the ssp secretory system in the export of foreign proteins across the outer membrane.

AB  == the gld genes encoding adenosylcobalamin-dependent glycerol dehydrase of klebsiella pneumoniae were cloned by cross-hybridization with a dna fragment of klebsiella oxytoca diol dehydrase genes. since the escherichia coli clones isolated did not show appreciable enzyme activity, plasmids for high level expression of cloned genes were constructed. the enzyme expressed in e. coli was  indistinguishable from the wild-type glycerol dehydrase of k. pneumoniae by the criteria of polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic, immunochemical, and catalytic properties. it was also shown that the recombinant functional enzyme consists of  mr 61,000, 22,000, and 16, 000 subunits. sequence analysis of the genes revealed  four open reading frames separated by 2-12 bases. the sequential three open reading frames from the first to the third (glda, gldb, and gldc genes) encoded polypeptides of 555, 194, and 141 amino acid residues with predicted molecular weights of 60,659(alpha), 21,355(beta), and 16,104(gamma), respectively. high level expression of these three genes in e. coli produced more than 14-fold higher level of fully active apoenzyme than that in k. pneumoniae. it was thus concluded that these are the genes encoding the subunits of glycerol dehydrase. the deduced amino acid sequences of the three subunits were 71, 58, and 54% identical with those of the alpha, beta, and gamma subunits of diol dehydrase, respectively, but failed to show any apparent homology with other proteins.

TI  == in vitro alcohol dehydrogenase-mediated acetaldehyde production by aerobic bacteria representing the normal colonic flora in man.
AB  == excessive ethanol consumption has been related with the development of liver cirrhosis, as well as with rapid intestinal transit time and diarrhea. moreover,  heavy drinking is associated with an increased incidence of cancer of the oropharynx, larynx, esophagus, and colorectum. acetaldehyde of microbial origin has recently been suggested as a possible pathogenic factor behind this alcohol-associated gastrointestinal morbidity. the present in vitro study was aimed to investigate alcohol dehydrogenase activity and acetaldehyde formation capacity of some major aerobic bacteria representing the normal colonic flora in  man. cytosolic alcohol dehydrogenase activity and cytosolic protein concentration were determined spectrophotometrically. alcohol dehydrogenase activity was then calculated as nmoles of reduced substrate produced by milligrams of protein per minute. the ability of different bacteria to produce acetaldehyde was determined  by incubating the intact bacterial suspension in closed vials containing ethanol  (final concentration 22 mm) for 1 hr at 37 degrees c. the acetaldehyde formed during the incubation was analyzed by headspace gas chromatography. marked differences in the alcohol dehydrogenase activity and acetaldehyde forming capacity were found among the strains tested. the alcohol dehydrogenase activity  varied from 606 +/- 91 nmol/min/mg protein (escherichia coli ih 50546) to 1 +/- 0.2 nmol/min/mg protein (e. coli ih 50817), and acetaldehyde formation varied from 1,717 +/- 2 nmol acetaldehyde/10(9) colony-forming units (klebsiella oxytoca ih 35403) to 5 +/- 2 nmol acetaldehyde/10(9) colony-forming units (pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853). there was a statistically significant correlation (r = 0.77; p < 0.001) between alcohol dehydrogenase activity and acetaldehyde production from ethanol, strongly suggesting the catalytic role of bacterial alcohol dehydrogenase in this reaction.

TI  == molecular aspects of high-level resistance to sulbactam-cefoperazone in klebsiella oxytoca clinical isolates.
AB  == nine klebsiella oxytoca strains which demonstrated resistance to the combination  of sulbactam and cefoperazone were isolated from geographically separate hospitals in japan in 1995. among them, k. oxytoca sb23 showed high-level resistance to sulbactam-cefoperazone (mic > 128 micrograms/ml) and aztreonam (mic, 128 micrograms/ml). the sulbactam-cefoperazone resistance was not transferred from strain sb23 to escherichia coli csh2 by conjugation, beta-lactamase rbia, produced by strain sb23, was purified, and the molecular mass was estimated to be 29 kda by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. kinetic parameters for rbia revealed that cefoperazone and aztreonam were hydrolyzed efficiently by this enzyme. moreover, ceftazidime and imipenem were also hydrolyzed weakly by rbia, although strain sb23 did not show any resistance to these agents. clavulanate, sulbactam, and tazobactam failed to  block the hydrolysis of cefoperazone by rbia. the structural gene of rbia (blarbi) was cloned and sequenced, and the deduced amino acid sequence of rbia demonstrated high-level similarities to those of the beta-lactamases found in k.  oxytoca d488, e23004, and plasmid-mediated men-1, which have been classified into bush functional group 2be. although rbia demonstrates high-level molecular similarity to the enzymes in group 2be, from an enzymological point of view, this enzyme might be differentiated from the enzymes in that group. hybridization analysis revealed that beta-lactamase genes highly similar to blarbi were generally encoded on the chromosome of the sulbactam-cefoperazone-resistant clinical isolates of k. oxytoca tested in the study, despite their different derivations. this observation suggests that sulbactam-cefoperazone-resistant a. oxytoca strains which produce rbia-type beta-lactamases have been proliferating in many hospitals in japan.

TI  == the cryptic general secretory pathway (gsp) operon of escherichia coli k-12 encodes functional proteins.
AB  == systematic sequencing of the escherichia coli k-12 chromosome (genbank entry u18997) has revealed the presence of an apparently complete operon of genes (the  gspc-0 operon) similar to genes coding for components of the main terminal branch of the general secretory pathway (e.g., the klebsiella oxytoca pulc-0 pullulanase secretion operon) and to related genes required for type iv pilus biogenesis. for example, the last gene in the gsp operon, gspo (formerly hopd), encodes a protein which is similar to several type iv prepilin peptidases. expression of gspo from  laczp promotes cleavage of two known prepilin peptidase substrates in e. coli k-12: neisseria gonorrhoeae type iv prepilin and k. oxytoca prepulg protein. gspo also complements a mutation in the corresponding gene (pulo) of the pullulanase secretion operon when it is expressed from laczp. another gene in the gsp operon, gspg (formerly hopg), encodes a protein similar to prepulg, a component of the pullulanase secretion pathway. expression of gspg from laczp leads to production  of a protein which (i) is recognized by pulg-specific antiserum (and by antiserum against the pseudomonas aeruginosa pulg homolog xcpg [formerly xcpt]), (ii) is processed in cells expressing gspo, and (iii) restores secretion in cells carrying a pulg mutation. the chromosomal copies of gspg and gspo are apparently  not expressed, probably because of very weak transcription from the upstream region, as measured by using a chromosomal gspc-lacz operon fusion. thus, the gsp operon of e. coli k-12 includes at least two functional genes which, together with the rest of the operon, are probably not expressed under laboratory conditions.

AB  == transmission of conjugative plasmids of the incn group into klebsiella oxytoca, but not into escherichia coli, results in the marked reduction of viability of the recipients. in the plasmid pcu1 a 500-bp locus called kika has the major role in determining this phenotype. expression of two open reading frames (orf104 and  orf70) is required for the kik+ phenotype and they can function in cis or in trans. orf104 encodes a 8.9-kda soluble protein which is translocated into the periplasm. orf70 encodes a 7.6-kda soluble protein which is found in the cytoplasm. the expression of the kika region from its natural promoter(s) is positively regulated at the level of transcription by an additional plasmid locus which is located within the tra region. further experiments show that the action  of kika causes reversible growth inhibition but does not affect cellular respiration and does not induce any morphological changes of the host cell.

TI  == in-vitro susceptibility of klebsiella oxytoca strains to 13 beta-lactams in the presence and absence of beta-lactamase inhibitors.
AB  == the susceptibility of klebsiella oxytoca isolates was tested by an agar diffusion method (167 strains collected in six countries) and an agar dilution method (38 strains). multivariate analysis of inhibition zone diameters by principal component analysis clearly individualised four susceptibility patterns, including the phenotype of strains overproducing beta-lactamase and resistant to penicillins, first-generation cephalosporins, cefuroxime and aztreonam, but susceptible to ceftazidime. this phenotype was different from that conferred by plasmid-mediated extended-spectrum beta-lactamases; strains expressing these enzymes were also resistant to ceftazidime and cefotaxime. the bla(oxy) gene from k. oxytoca was introduced into escherichia coli and k. oxytoca recipients and conferred increased resistance to beta-lactams in the recipient cells. clavulanic acid was effective in association with piperacillin (mic decreased 36-fold), ceftriaxone (35-fold) and aztreonam (19-fold) against overproducing strains, in spite of a relatively high ic50 (0.3 microm). sulbactam (ic50, 400 microm) was ineffective in this context when combined with piperacillin (mic decreased 1.5-fold), ceftriaxone (1.6-fold) and aztreonam (1.6-fold). the inhibitory activity of tazobactam (ic50, 8.2 microm) was heterogeneous depending on the strain and the beta-lactam with which it was combined. when combined with piperacillin or ceftriaxone little potentiation in antibiotic activity occurred (mic decreased 3.9-fold and 4.5-fold, respectively); however, tazobactam plus aztreonam resulted in a 50-fold decrease in mic of antibiotic.

TI  == molecular epidemiology of klebsiella pneumoniae producing shv-5 beta- lactamase:  parallel outbreaks due to multiple plasmid transfer.
AB  == over a period of 22 months, 32 patients treated in three independent intensive care units of the innsbruck university hospital were infected with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing members of the family enterobacteriaceae (30 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 1 klebsiella oxytoca isolate, and 1 escherichia coli isolate). as confirmed by sequencing of a bla gene pcr fragment, all isolates expressed the shv-5-type beta-lactamase. genomic  fingerprinting of epidemic strains with xbai and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis grouped 20 of 21 isolates from ward a into two consecutive clusters which included 1 of 3 ward b isolates. all six k. pneumoniae isolates from ward c formed a third cluster. stool isolates of asymptomatic patients and environmental isolates belonged to these clusters as well. additionally, 2,600 routine k. pneumoniae isolates from the surrounding provinces (population, 900,000) were screened for shv-5 production. only one of six nonepidemic isolates producing shv-5 beta-lactamase was matched with the outbreak strains by genomic fingerprinting. plasmid fingerprinting, however, revealed the epidemic spread of  a predominant r-plasmid, with a size of approximately 80 kb, associated with 29 of the 30 k. pneumoniae isolates. this plasmid was also present in the single k.  oxytoca and e. coli isolates from ward c and in three nonepidemic isolates producing shv-5. our results underline that strain typing exclusively on the genomic level can be misleading in the epidemiological investigation of plasmid-encoded extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. our evidence for multiple events of r-plasmid transfer between species of the family enterobacteriaceae in  this nosocomial outbreak stresses the need for plasmid typing, especially because shv-5 beta-lactamase seems to be regionally spread predominantly via plasmid transfer.

TI  == insertion of an outer membrane protein in escherichia coli requires a chaperone-like protein.
AB  == only one of the characterized components of the main terminal branch of the general secretory pathway (gsp) in gram-negative bacteria, gspd, is an integral outer membrane protein that could conceivably form a channel to permit protein transport across this membrane. puld, a member of the gspd protein family required for pullulanase secretion by klebsiella oxytoca, is shown here to form outer membrane-associated complexes which are not readily dissociated by sds treatment. the outer membrane association of puld is absolutely dependent on another component of the gsp, the outer membrane-anchored lipoprotein puls. furthermore, the absence of puls resulted in limited proteolysis of puld and caused induction of the so-called phage shock response, as measured by increased  expression of the pspa gene. we propose that puls may be the first member of a new family of periplasmic chaperones that are specifically required for the insertion of a group of outer membrane proteins into this membrane. puls is only  the second component of the main terminal branch of the gsp for which a precise function can be proposed.

TI  == metabolism of cyclodextrins by klebsiella oxytoca m5a1: purification and characterisation of a cytoplasmically located cyclodextrinase.
AB  == it has been shown previously that the products of 11 genes are required for metabolism of starch by klebsiella oxytoca via a novel pathway. an extracellular  cyclodextrin glucanotransferase first degrades starch into alpha- and beta-cyclodextrins; evidence then has been presented that the cyclodextrins are transported into the cytoplasma via a specific system and that they are metabolised inside the cell. to provide support for this model, we have analysed  whether klebsiella oxytoca possesses a cytoplasmic enzyme able to linearise cyclodextrins. a possible candidate was the product of the cymh gene since it displays sequence similarity with cyclodextrinases from other organisms. the cymh gene was overexpressed, and the cymh protein was purified. cymh is a monomer of 69 kda molecular mass and hydrolysed cyclodextrins at an optimum ph of 7.0 and an optimum temperature of 23 degrees c, respectively. the apparent km increased with increasing size of the cyclodextrins, but the reaction velocity decreased. linear malto-oligosaccharides were also accepted as substrates, but were hydrolysed with a lower efficiency. final products in each case were maltose and maltotriose. it  was demonstrated by immunoblotting that cymh is located in the cytoplasm and that no signal peptide was cleaved off. since cymh mutants were no longer able to grow on cyclodextrins, these results prove that cyclodextrins are degraded inside the  cell, and they support the contention of the existence of a specific transport system.

TI  == genetics of a novel starch utilisation pathway present in klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  == a 14.3 kb dna fragment from klebsiella oxytoca m5a1 has been cloned and shown to  provide escherichia coli with the capacity for growth on alpha- and beta-cyclodextrins. this fragment is located immediately upstream of the previously identified cgt gene coding for cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase. it contains ten genes (cym) organised in two divergently oriented clusters separated by a non-coding region of 419 bp. four of the genes code for products homologous  to the maltose and linear maltodextrin uptake system, another one for a putative  cytoplasmic cyclodextrinase. the cym genes of k. oxytoca are distinct and different from the mal genes; cym mutations do not affect maltose catabolism. on  the other hand, whereas mutations in the maltose/maltodextrin-uptake genes do not influence cyclodextrin metabolism, a mutation inactivating the malpq genes coding for maltodextrin phosphorylase and amylomaltase does. cyclodextrin catabolism is  independent of the presence of a functional cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase but  degradation of starch and gamma-cyclodextrins requires the activity of this enzyme. the results indicate the existence of a novel starch degradation pathway  which involves the extracellular conversion of starch into cyclodextrins by cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase, uptake of the cyclodextrins by a specific uptake system and intracellular linearisation by a cyclodextrinase. the malto-oligosaccharides produced are then channelled into the maltodextrin-degradation route involving the activity of maltodextrin phosphorylase and amylomaltase.

AB  == amino acid sequences determined either by protein sequencing or by dna sequencing are identical for cefotaximases ctx-m-1 and men-1, whereas ctx-m-2 is 84% identical to ctx-m-1/men-1. both beta-lactamases are distantly related to other plasmidic class a enzymes (homology to tem-1 is 38.1% for ctx-m-1/men-1 and 36.5% for ctx-m-2); the closest relationship was with the chromosomal beta-lactamase of klebsiella oxytoca e23004 (homologies of 74.5% for ctx-m-1/men-1 and 77.9% for ctx-m-2). the cefotaximases ctx-m-1/men-1 and ctx-m-2 represent two members of a  new subgroup of plasmidic class a beta-lactamases.

TI  == cefetamet pivoxil: comparable evaluation with other orally available antibiotics  against selected species of respiratory pathogens.
AB  == cefetamet pivoxil, the prodrug ester of cefetamet, is a new third-generation cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of activity. the in vitro activity of cefetamet was superior to that of cefaclor, ceftibuten, amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, and amoxicillin alone when tested against 403 strains of freshly isolated upper and lower respiratory tract pathogens. cefetamet killed 100% haemophilus influenzae and h. parainfluenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing  strains, at < or = 0.25 mg/l, streptococcus pyogenes and s. pneumoniae at < or =  0.5 mg/l, s. agalactiae at < or = 0.1 mg/l, and streptococci at < or = 2.0 mg/l.  moreover, at < or = 4 mg/l (breaking point), cefetamet was also highly effective  against escherichia coli (94%), klebsiella pneumoniae (92%), k. oxytoca (91%) and, at 1 mg/l, against moraxella catarrhalis (90%), including beta-lactamase-producing strains. furthermore, time-killing analyses at 4 x mic demonstrated that cefetamet was bactericidal against beta-lactamase-producing h.  influenzae, m. catarrhalis, and k. pneumoniae within 6 h and s. pneumoniae within 4 h. hydrolysis studies confirmed cefetamet's stability to tem1 and shv1, the most common enterobacterial beta-lactamases.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of cefepime against clinically isolated strains].
AB  == in order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefepime (cfpm), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cfpm and other drugs were determined against  clinical isolates that were obtained in 1994. 1. cfpm showed a wide antibacterial spectrum against staphylococcus spp. and glucose non-fermentative gram-negative rods ((g)nf-gnr). antimicrobial activities of cfpm against staphylococcus spp. were stronger than those of ceftazidime (caz) and somewhat stronger than those of cefotaxime (ctx), and antimicrobial activity of cfpm against pseudomonas aeruginosa was same as that of caz. 2. antimicrobial activities of cfpm against almost all of enterobacteriaceae were stronger than those of caz and ctx. and cfpm showed strong antimicrobial activities against caz-resistant escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii and enterobacter spp. 3. antimicrobial activities of cfpm were weaker than those of caz against some of strains of klebsiella oxytoca, beta-lactamase high producing strains of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis and than those of ctx against beta-lactamase high producing strains of prevotella spp. 4. the feature of new cephems was demonstrated in that cfpm had wider antibacterial spectrum than cephems of previous genenations against staphylococcus spp. and (g)nf-gnr and cfpm showed strong antimicrobial activities against almost all of oxacephem-resistant enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == lethality and survival of klebsiella oxytoca evoked by conjugative incn group plasmids.
AB  == the transmission of plasmid pcu1 (or other incn group plasmid) into a population  of klebsiella oxytoca cells reduces the viability of the population. a 2,400-bp region adjacent to traa is responsible for this phenotype and includes two regions, called kika and kikc. klebsiella cells which received this region and survived were found to acquire a chromosomal mutation which renders them immune to killing even after the plasmid is cured from the cells. to obtain insight into the mode of this apparent lethality, an appropriate pcu1lacz derivative was constructed. it could be introduced with high efficiency into klebsiella cells. analyses of the resultant colonies indicate that the loss of viability is not a consequence of the death of plasmid-free segregants. on the contrary and unlike postsegregational killing by plasmids, cells survived by losing the plasmid or by acquiring, secondarily, a chromosomal mutation which confers immunity to killing.

AB  == the bbl crystal enteric/nonfermenter (crystal, becton dickinson microbiology systems) is a new multi-test identification system for gram negative rods requiring no oil overlay or addition of reagents. one hundred and three selected  gram negative rod isolates from routine clinical specimens were tested in parallel using the appropriate api20e or api20ne (biomerieux) reading after overnight incubation. the isolates included in the study, and the number tested,  were as follows: acinetobacter sp, 8; aeromonas hydrophila, 1; citrobacter diversus, 1; citrobacter freundii, 1; escherichia coli, 13; enterobacter aerogenes, 10; enterobacter agglomerans, 2; enterobacter cloacae, 6; klebsiella oxytoca, 6; klebsiella pneumoniae, 12; morganella morganii, 2; proteus mirabilis, 6; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21; salmonella sp, 2; salmonella typhi, 1; serratia marcescens, 1; shigella sonnei, 2; shigella sp, 2; vibrio metschnikovii, 1; xanthomonas maltophilia, 3; and, yersinia enterocolitica, 2. the api20e and api20ne systems combined identified 74.8% (77/103) and the crystal 97.1% (100/103) of isolates. twenty six isolates required repeat and/or additional tests for correct identification with the api systems compared to 3 with the crystal. crystal is more convenient than api for routine clinical use because it  requires fewer repeat and/or extra tests, and is easier and less time consuming to use.

TI  == cloning and sequence of the gene encoding a cefotaxime-hydrolyzing class a beta-lactamase isolated from escherichia coli.
AB  == escherichia coli tuh12191, which is resistant to piperacillin, cefazolin, cefotiam, ceftizoxime, cefuzonam, and aztreonam but is susceptible to cefoxitin,  latamoxef, flomoxef, and imipenem, was isolated from the urine of a patient treated with beta-lactam antibiotics. the beta-lactamase (toho-1) purified from the bacteria had a pi of 7.8, had a molecular weight of about 29,000, and hydrolyzed beta-lactam antibiotics such as penicillin g, ampicillin, oxacillin, carbenicillin, piperacillin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and aztreonam. toho-1 was markedly inhibited by beta-lactamase inhibitors such as clavulanic acid and tazobactam. resistance to beta-lactams, streptomycin, spectinomycin, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim was transferred by conjugational transfer from e. coli tuh12191 to e. coli ml4903, and the transferred plasmid was about 58 kbp, belonging to incompatibility group m. the cefotaxime resistance gene for toho-1 was subcloned from the 58-kbp plasmid by transformation of e. coli mv1184. the sequence of the gene for toho-1 was determined, and the open reading frame of the gene consisted of 873 or 876 bases  (initial sequence, atgatg). the nucleotide sequence of the gene (ddbj accession number d37830) was found to be about 73% homologous to the sequence of the gene encoding a class a beta-lactamase produced by klebsiella oxytoca e23004. according to the amino acid sequence deduced from the dna sequence, the precursor consisted of 290 or 291 amino acid residues, which contained amino acid motifs common to class a beta-lactamases (70sxxk, 130sdn, and 234ktg). toho-1 was about  83% homologous to the beta-lactamase mediated by the chromosome of k. oxytoca d488 and the beta-lactamase mediated by the plasmid of e. coli men-1. therefore,  the newly isolated beta-lactamase toho-1 produced by e. coli tuh12191 is similar  to beta-lactamases produced by k. oxytoca d488, k. oxytoca e23004, and e. coli men-1 rather than to mutants of tem or shv enzymes. toho-1 has shown the highest  degree of similarity to k. oxytoca class a beta-lactamase. detailed comparison of toho-1 with other beta-lactamases implied that replacement of asn-276 by arg with the concomitant substitution of thr for arg-244 is an important mutation in the extension of the substrate specificity.

TI  == extracellular secretion of pullulanase is unaffected by minor sequence changes but is usually prevented by adding reporter proteins to its n- or c-terminal end.
AB  == linker insertions in the pullulanase structural gene (pula) were examined for their effects on pullulanase activity and cell surface localization in escherichia coli carrying the cognate secretion genes from klebsiella oxytoca. of the 23 insertions, 11 abolished pullulanase activity but none were found to prevent secretion. to see whether more drastic changes affected secretion, we fused up to five reporter proteins (e. coli periplasmic alkaline phosphatase, e.  coli periplasmic maltose-binding protein, periplasmic tem beta-lactamase, erwinia chrysanthemi extracellular endoglucanase z, and bacillus subtilis extracellular levansucrase) to three different positions in the pullulanase polypeptide: close  to the n terminus of the mature protein, at the c terminus of the protein, or at  the c terminus of a truncated pullulanase variant lacking the last 256 amino acids. only 3 of the 13 different hybrids were efficiently secreted: 2 in which beta-lactamase was fused to the c terminus of full-length or truncated pullulanase and 1 in which maltose-binding protein was fused close to the n terminus of pullulanase. affinity-purified endoglucanase-pullulanase and pullulanase-endoglucanase hybrids exhibited apparently normal levels of pullulanase activity, indicating that the conformation of the pullulanase segment of the hybrid had not been dramatically altered by the presence of the reporter.  however, pullulanase-endoglucanase hybrids were secreted efficiently if the endoglucanase component comprised only the 60-amino-acid, c-terminal cellulose-binding domain, suggesting that at least one factor limiting hybrid protein secretion might be the size of the reporter.

TI  == molecular epidemiology of ceftazidime resistant enterobacteriaceae from patients  on a paediatric oncology ward.
AB  == between the autumn of 1989 and january 1990, 21 of the 44 children on the paediatric oncology ward of st. james's university hospital, leeds, uk were infected or colonised with enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. this represents 48% of the patients on the ward. only six patients (14%) had microbiologically proven septicaemia caused by such bacteria during this period. eighty-one isolates of enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases derived from blood culture (7 isolates from 6 patients) or faecal samples (74 isolates) were available for examination. these comprised 28 escherichia coli, 28 klebsiella oxytoca, 11 klebsiella pneumoniae, 10 citrobacter freundii, 3 enterobacter spp. and 1 serratia marcescens. clinical  isolates were resistant to penicillins and to ceftazidime. strains isolated in this study also showed multiple resistance to a range of antimicrobial agents. transfer to a nalidixic acid resistant laboratory strain of e. coli ub5201 was attempted, but transfer of the ceftazidime resistance determinant was only successful in 25 isolates (31%). examination of plasmid dna revealed sequences in each isolate that hybridised with the tem beta-lactamase gene probe used on a variety of plasmids ranging in size from 2.5- > 150 kb, sometimes found on several replicons in a single isolate. the tem gene probe also hybridised with chromosomal dna in a large number of isolates. nucleotide sequence analysis demonstrated the presence of three extended-spectrum beta-lactamases: tem-10b produced by two isolates, tem-12b produced by 37 isolates and tem-26b produced by 40 isolates. in two cases, isolates produced two beta-lactamases, and it proved impossible to identify these enzymes unequivocally. the genes encoding tem-10b and tem-26b both differ from tem-12b by single nucleotide substitutions. analysis of the ribotype patterns derived from the clinical isolates provided evidence for cross-colonisation between patients, and this was confirmed by analysis of the plasmid profiles. four years after discontinuing ceftazidime and other extended-spectrum cephalosporins on this ward, patients were still colonised with bacteria that produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.

AB  == dna fragments harboring the nickel resistance determinants from bacteria isolated from anthropogenically polluted ecosystems in europe and zaire were compared with those harboring the nickel resistance determinants from bacteria isolated from naturally nickel-percolated soils from new caledonia by dna-dna hybridization. the biotinylated dna probes were derived from the previously described alcaligenes eutrophus ch34, alcaligenes xylosoxidans 31a, alcaligenes denitrificans 4a-2, and klebsiella oxytoca ccug 15788 and four new nickel resistance-determining fragments cloned from strains isolated from soils under nickel-hyperaccumulating trees. nine probes were hybridized with endonuclease-cleaved plasmid and total dna samples from 56 nickel-resistant strains. some of the new caledonian strains were tentatively identified as acinetobacter, pseudomonas mendocina, comamonas, hafnia alvei, burkholderia, arthrobacter aurescens, and arthrobacter ramosus strains. the dna of most strains showed homologies to one or several of the following nickel resistance determinants: the cnr and ncc operons of the strains a. eutrophus ch34 and a. xylosoxidans 31a, respectively, the nre operon of strain 31a, and the nickel resistance determinants of k. oxytoca. on the basis of their hybridization reactions the nickel resistance determinants of the strains could be assigned to  four groups: (i) cnr/ncc type, (ii) cnr/ncc/nre type, (iii) k. oxytoca type, and  (iv) others. the majority of the strains were assigned to the known groups. among the strains from belgium and zaire, exclusively the cnr/ncc and the cnr/ncc/nre types were found. among the new caledonian strains all four types were represented. homologies to the nre operon were found only in combination with the cnr/ncc operon. the homologies to the cnr/ncc operon were the most abundant and were detected alone or together with homologies to the nre operon. only the dna of the strains isolated from soil in scotland and the united states and that of five of the new caledonian strains did not show any detectable homologies to any  of our probes. the nickel resistance fragment isolated from burkholderia strain 32w-2 was studied in some detail. this 15-kb bamhi fragment conferred resistance  to 1 to 5 mm nicl(inf2) to escherichia coli and resistance to up to 25 mm nicl(inf2) to a. eutrophus. it showed strong homologies to both the cnr/ncc operon and the nre operon and conferred strictly regulated (inducible) nickel resistance to a. eutrophus.

TI  == a gene from alcaligenes denitrificans that confers albicidin resistance by reversible antibiotic binding.
AB  == albicidin antibiotics specifically block prokaryote dna replication. the albicidin resistance gene (albb) cloned from a soil isolate of alcaligenes denitrificans encodes a 23 kda protein capable of detoxifying albicidin by reversible binding. this mechanism operates intracellularly to protect dna replication in albicidin-sensitive escherichia coli expressing the cloned resistance gene, which can be induced fivefold in the presence of 1.5 micrograms  albicidin ml-1 in the surrounding medium. the coding region of 621 bp has regions with partial dna sequence homology to an albicidin resistance gene (alba) from klebsiella oxytoca, but with rearrangements and frame-shifts resulting in loss of protein homology. there is a short region of n-terminal homology between the albicidin resistance (albr) proteins from a. denitrificans and k. oxytoca, although the two genes use different codons for shared amino acids. the n-terminal homology suggested a common functional domain; this was confirmed by deletion analysis, translational fusions and albicidin binding by a synthetic oligopeptide. antibiotic binding provides a high level of albicidin resistance in e. coli. the gene appears to be a useful candidate for transfer to plants to protect plastid dna replication from inhibition by albicidin phytotoxins involved in sugarcane leaf scald disease.

AB  == klebsiella oxytoca strain ccug 15788, isolated from a mineral oil emulsion tank in goteborg, sweden, was found to be nickel-resistant (tolerating 10 mm nicl2 in  non-complexing mineral-gluconate media; inducible resistance). the nickel resistance determinants were transferred by helper-assisted conjugation to various strains of escherichia coli and citrobacter freundii and expressed to between 5 and 10 mm nicl2. a 4.3 kb hindiii fragment was cloned from the genomic  dna of k. oxytoca. ligated into the vector psup202, the fragment caused constitutive nickel resistance (of up to 3 or 10 mm ni2+) in various e. coli strains. after cloning into the broad host range vector pvdz'2 the fragment even  expressed low nickel resistance in the transconjugant of alcaligenes eutrophus ae104. with the 4.3 kb hindiii fragment as a biotinylated dna probe it was shown  by dna-dna hybridization that the nickel resistance determinant resides on the chromosome of k. oxytoca and not on its circular plasmid pko1 (160 kb) or linear  plasmid pko2 (50 kb). nickel resistance strongly correlated with the presence of  the 4.3 kb hindiii fragment in the transconjugants. no homologies were detected when the nickel resistance determinants of other well-known nickel-resistant bacteria, such as a. eutrophus ch34 or a. denitrificans 4a-2, were used as target dna. among the 60 strains examined, positive signals only appeared with the 3.1 kb dna fragment from a. xylosoxydans 31a and the genomic dna of two enterobacterial strains (5-1 and 5-5) isolated from nickel-rich soil in new caledonia.

TI  == a plasmid-encoded prepilin peptidase gene from enteropathogenic escherichia coli.
AB  == enteropathogenic escherichia coli, a leading agent of infantile diarrhea worldwide, adheres to tissue culture cells in a pattern called "localized adherence." localized adherence is associated with bundle-forming pili encoded by the plasmid bfpa gene, the product of which is homologous with the major structural subunit proteins of type iv fimbriae in other bacteria. several of these proteins have been shown to be processed from a precursor by a specific prepilin peptidase. we cloned restriction fragments downstream of the bfpa gene into an e. coli-pseudomonas aeruginosa shuttle vector and mobilized them into a p. aeruginosa prepilin peptidase (pild) mutant. a plasmid containing a 1.3-kb psti-bamhi fragment was able to complement the pild mutation, as demonstrated by  restoration of sensitivity to the pilus-specific bacteriophage po4. the dna sequence of this fragment revealed an open reading frame, designated bfpp, the predicted product of which is homologous to other prepilin peptidases, including  tcpj of vibrio cholerae (30% identical amino acids), pulo of klebsiella oxytoca (29%), and pild of p. aeruginosa (28%). a bfpa::tnphoa mutant complemented with a bfpa-containing dna fragment only partially processes the bfpa protein. when complemented with a larger fragment containing bfpp as well as bfpa, the mutant expresses the fully processed bfpa protein. p. aeruginosa pak, but not a pild mutant of pak, expresses mature bfpa protein when the bfpa gene is mobilized into this strain. thus, as in other type iv fimbria systems, enteropathogenic e. coli  utilizes a specific prepilin peptidase to process the major subunit of the bundle-forming pilus. this prepilin petidase contains sequence and reciprocal functional homologies with the pild protein of p. aeruginosa.

TI  == the type 3 fimbrial adhesin gene (mrkd) of klebsiella species is not conserved among all fimbriate strains.
AB  == the type 3 fimbriae of enteric bacteria mediate agglutination, in vitro, of erythrocytes treated with tannic acid. the gene encoding the polypeptide, mrkd, that mediates this agglutination reaction was placed downstream of an inducible promoter, and the ability of mrkd alone to facilitate hemagglutination was determined. although escherichia coli transformants could be shown to produce the mrkd protein, hemagglutination did not occur in the absence of other mrk gene products. in addition, the mrkd polypeptide did not cross the bacterial outer membrane unless a fimbrial chaperone protein was also present. analysis of the frequency of the mrkd gene within the genus klebsiella indicated that this gene is conserved in strains of klebsiella oxytoca but not in other fimbriate klebsiella species. in the small number of strains of klebsiella pneumoniae that  do possess a related mrkd gene, this determinant could be found on a plasmid in one strain. the ability of type 3 fimbriate bacteria to adhere to type v collagen was found to be a function of a specific mrkd polypeptide. this adhesin is frequently found in strains of k. oxytoca but is rarely associated with the type  3 fimbriae of k. pneumoniae.

AB  == the in vitro activity of cp-99,219 was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 814 clinical bacterial isolates using a microdilution method with brain-heart infusion broth. cp-99,219 was the most potent agent tested against methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylocci (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic]90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was 32-fold and fourfold more potent than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, respectively, against streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin g and erythromycin (mic90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was also the most potent agent tested against s. pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis (mic90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). the activity of cp-99,219 against enterobacteriaceae was comparable to that of sparfloxacin, with 90% of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, c.  diversus, helicobacter pylori, and k. oxytoca being inhibited by < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were less susceptible, with mic90 values to cp-99,219 of 4, 2, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 for bacteroides fragilis was 0.39 microgram/ml for cp-99,219 compared with 12.5 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. cp-99,219 was highly bactericidal at 1 x to 4 x mic against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms; its activity was similar in nutrient, trypticase soy, and cation-supplemented mueller-hinton broths. the spectrum and potency observed with cp-99,219 warrant further testing with this novel quinolone.

TI  == chiral inversion of drug: role of intestinal bacteria in the stereoselective sulphoxide reduction of flosequinan.
AB  == chiral inversion at a sulphoxide position of flosequinan enantiomers [(+/-)-7-fluoro-1-methyl-3-methylsulphinyl-4-quinolone] occurred in conventional  rats but not in either germ-free rats or rats treated with antibiotics after an oral administration of each enantiomer. thus, it was postulated that the chiral inversion occurred by mechanisms mediated by intestinal bacteria. the intestinal  content isolated from conventional rats reduced r(+)- and s(-)-flosequinan to produce the sulphide, while intestinal content from rats treated with antibiotics did not reduce the drug. several strains of facultative anaerobes possessed a high flosequinan reducing activity. escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca and klebsiella pneumoniae reduced r(+)-flosequinan to the sulphide stereoselectively. on the other hand, enterobacter aerogenes and micrococcus agilis exclusively reduced s(-)-flosequinan. the sulphide, which could be produced by intestinal bacteria from r(+)- and s(-)-flosequinan, was readily absorbed upon an oral administration to rats, and was oxidized fairly rapidly to r(+)- and s(-)-flosequinan and further to the sulphone form. based on these data, it has been confirmed that chiral inversion at the sulphoxide position of flosequinan enantiomers occur via stereoselective reduction of sulphoxide by intestinal bacteria to form the sulphide, followed by oxidation of the sulphide in the body  to produce r(+)- and s(-)-flosequinan.

TI  == the nasfedcba operon for nitrate and nitrite assimilation in klebsiella pneumoniae m5al.
AB  == klebsiella pneumoniae can use nitrate and nitrite as sole nitrogen sources through the nitrate assimilation pathway. we previously identified structural genes for assimilatory nitrate and nitrite reductases, nasa and nasb, respectively. we report here our further identification of four genes, nasfedc, upstream of the nasba genes. the nasfedcba genes probably form an operon. mutational and complementation analyses indicated that both the nasc and nasa genes are required for nitrate assimilation. the predicted nasc protein is homologous to a variety of nadh-dependent oxidoreductases. thus, the nasc protein probably mediates electron transfer from nadh to the nasa protein, which contains the active site for nitrate reduction. the deduced nasf, nase, and nasd proteins  are homologous to the nrta, nrtb, and nrtd proteins, respectively, that are involved in nitrate uptake in synechococcus sp. (t. omata, x. andriesse, and a. hirano, mol. gen. genet. 236:193-202, 1993). mutational and complementation studies indicated that the nasd gene is required for nitrate but not nitrite assimilation. by analogy with the synechococcus nrt genes, we propose that the nasfed genes are involved in nitrate transport in k. pneumoniae.

TI  == molecular characterization of pule, a protein required for pullulanase secretion.
AB  == pule, one of 14 genes specifically required for pullulanase secretion in klebsiella oxytoca, codes for a putative nucleotide-binding protein. subcellular  fractionation indicated that the majority of pule in escherichia coli cells expressing all 14 secretion genes is mainly associated with the cytoplasmic membrane through both hydrophobic and non-hydrophobic interactions. mutational analysis revealed that one of the two regions of pule that are conserved in many  nucleotide-binding proteins (walker box a) is essential for pullulanase secretion. likewise, mutations that removed aspartate residues from each of two regions immediately downstream from the walker box a also reduced secretion. these aspartate-rich regions are highly conserved in all 16 known pule homologues but not in any other nucleotide-binding proteins. altogether, these results indicate that pule might belong to a new family of nucleotide-binding proteins. the protein could not be cross-linked to the photoactivatable atp analogue azido-atp, however. most pule point or deletion mutations which prevented pullulanase secretion exhibited transdominance when expressed at high levels in cells producing wild-type pule protein. evidence presented suggests that pule might be a homodimer.

TI  == convergent evolution of tem-26, a beta-lactamase with extended-spectrum activity.
AB  == tem-26, an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase has been characterized in clinical isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli derived from patients on the paediatric oncology unit of st james's university hospital, leeds. the nucleotide sequence of this beta-lactamase gene (blatem26b) was determined, and compared with the nucleotide sequences of other tem-type beta-lactamases. the blatem26b gene was found to differ from blatem12b by a single nucleotide. this difference causes the substitution of glutamic acid in blatem12b for lysine in blatem26b at position 102 in the predicted amino acid sequence. the blatem12b gene was first described in an isolate of klebsiella oxytoca from a patient nursed on the same unit that yielded the strains that carry blatem26b. however, the blatem26b gene differs at no less than six nucleotides from the nucleotide sequence encoding the tem-26 beta-lactamase that was first described in isolates  from cancer patients nursed in the children's hospital, stanford, california, usa. this indicates that the genes encoding tem-26 have evolved from different progenitors.

AB  == the cloned poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (phb) synthesis pathway from alcaligenes eutrophus has been introduced into sucrose-utilizing strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella aerogenes, and klebsiella oxytoca. the plasmid-borne genes were well expressed in these environments and were able to mediate the production of significant amounts of phb when the bacteria were grown with sucrose as the sole  carbon source. the molecular weight of the phb polymer made in k. aerogenes and e. coli was approximately 1 x 10(6) to 2 x 10(6). sucrose uptake in k. aerogenes  was measured and found to be similar to that found for other klebsiella strains,  but sucrose uptake in the e. coli strain was not detectable. k. aerogenes is able to utilize sugarcane molasses as the sole carbon source to accumulate phb at the  rate of approximately 1 g of phb per liter of culture fluid per h. a k. oxytoca fadr strain was able to incorporate 3-hydroxyvalerate into a poly-(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (phb-co-v) polymer to levels as high as 56 mol% when grown in a medium containing propionate. total phb-co-v levels could be enhanced by adding propionate at the beginning of stationary phase rather than at the time of inoculation.

TI  == type iv prepilin peptidase gene of neisseria gonorrhoeae ms11: presence of a related gene in other piliated and nonpiliated neisseria strains.
AB  == the assembly of type iv pili in neisseria gonorrhoeae is a complex process likely to require the products of many genes. one of these is the enzyme prepilin peptidase, which cleaves and then n methylates the precursor pilin subunits prior to their assembly into pili. we have used a pcr amplification strategy to clone the n. gonorrhoeae prepilin peptidase gene, pildng. a single copy of the gene is  shown to be present in the chromosome. its product promotes correct cleavage of the gonococcal prepillin in escherichia coli cells carrying both the prepilin peptidase gene and the pilin structural gene. pildng also cleaves prepulg, a type iv pilin-like protein of klebsiella oxytoca. moreover, pildng complements a mutation in the gene coding for the prepilin peptidase-like protein of k. oxytoca, pulo, partially restoring pulg-pulo-dependent extracellular secretion of the enzyme pullulanase. finally, we show that genes homologous to pildng are present and expressed in a variety of species in the genus neisseria, including some commensal strains.

TI  == phenotypic diversity of anaerobic glycerol dissimilation shown by seven enterobacterial species.
AB  == the anaerobic glycerol pathway was studied in seven enterobacterial species selected as representative of different behaviours in terms of anaerobic glycerol dissimilation. the presence of oxidative and reductive pathways of the dha regulon in klebsiella pneumoniae enabled the cells to grow fermentatively on glycerol. the first two enzymes of the dha regulon (glycerol dehydrogenase type i and dihydroxyacetone kinase) represent the oxidative branch, while the latter two (glycerol dehydratase and 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase) represent the reductive  branch of glycerol fermentation. the slower utilization of glycerol by k. oxytoca was attributed to low production of 1,3-propanediol. k. oxytoca lacked glycerol dehydratase and demonstrated low 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase activity. k. planticola and k. ozaenae differed from k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca in lacking the ability to grow on glycerol. k. planticola lacked both enzymes of the reductive branch of glycerol fermentation, and k. ozaenae possessed glycerol dehydrogenase only. k. rhinoscleromatis and hafnia alvei, like escherichia coli,  did not possess a dha regulon. the glycerol dehydrogenase type ii of h. alvei was distinct from that of e. coli. the phenotypic diversity of anaerobic glycerol dissimilation may have taxonomic applications.

TI  == ethanol from lignocellulosic wastes with utilization of recombinant bacteria.
AB  == this article presents the advanced technology that has been developed by bioenergy international of gainesville, florida, utilizing novel recombinant strains of bacteria developed by lonnie ingram of the university of florida. the  first commercial applications of these unique fermenting organisms convert 5-carbon sugars, as well as 6-carbon sugars, and oligomers of cellulose (e.g., cellobiose and cellotriose) directly to ethanol. the proposed systems that will be utilized for conversion of agricultural wastes, mixed waste papers, and pulp and paper mill waste in forthcoming commercial installations are now under design. this involves the extensive experience of raphael katzen associates international, inc. in acid hydrolysis, enzyme production, enzymatic hydrolysis,  large-scale fermentation engineering, and distillation/dehydration. specific examples of this advanced technology will be presented in different applications, namely: 1. conversion of the hemicellulose content of sugar cane bagasse to 5-carbon sugars by mild-acid prehydrolysis, followed by fermentation of the 5-carbon sugar extract with recombinant escherichia coli in a commercial installation soon to be under construction in brazil. this unique process utilizes the surplus hemicellulose fraction of bagasse not required for steam and power generation to produce ethanol, additional to that from the original can juice, which has been converted by conventional sucrose fermentation to ethanol.  the process also recovers and converts to ethanol the majority of sucrose normally lost with the bagasse fibers. resultant beer is enriched in an innovative process to eliminate the need for incremental rectification capacity.  2. application of this technology to mixed waste paper in florida, with a moderate loading of newsprint (85% mechanical wood fiber), will involve a mild-acid prehydrolysis, the partial extraction of the 5-carbon sugars produced from hemicellulose as a feedstock for propagation of the recombinant klebsiella oxytoca bacterium. included is a facility providing for in-house production of cellulase enzyme, as an active whole broth for direct use in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (ssf) of the remaining cellulose and residual 5-carbon sugars to ethanol. this is followed by distillation and dehydration in the advanced commercially available low-energy recovery system. 3. another potential application of this unique technology involves utilization of a variety of wastes from several pulp and paper mills in close proximity, permitting collection of these wastes at low cost and reducing the considerable cost encountered in disposing of such low-energy wet waste.(abstract truncated at 400  words)

TI  == the general secretory pathway of klebsiella oxytoca: no evidence for relocalization or assembly of pilin-like pulg protein into a multiprotein complex.
AB  == it has been proposed that the four type iv pilin-like proteins that are required  for extracellular protein secretion by the general secretory pathway (gsp) might  assemble into a trans-periplasm complex resembling a type iv pilus. to test this  idea, we examined the subcellular distribution and oligomeric state of pulg, one  of the type iv pilin-like proteins required for pullulanase secretion in klebsiella oxytoca. fractionation of escherichia coli cells carrying a single copy of each pul gene showed that pulg protein was located in two distinct envelope fractions corresponding to the outer and cytoplasmic membranes. the protein was partially released by treating the membranes with triton x-100 + edta or at high ph, but not by triton x-100 alone or by 8 m urea, 6 m guanidine hydrochloride or 1 m nacl. like type iv pilins, non-sedimentable pulg that had been released from the membranes at high ph could be sedimented by centrifugation when the ph was lowered. treatment of whole cells, sphaeroplasts or isolated membranes with a cleavable cross-linking agent produced mainly pulg homodimers. previous studies showed that both pulo, which cleaves and n-methylates the pulg precursor, and pule, a putative atp-binding protein, share extensive sequence identity with proteins known to be required for type iv pilus processing and assembly. however, mutations which disrupted either pule or pulo, or indeed the complete absence of all other components of the pullulanase secretion apparatus,  had little or no effect on any of the properties of pulg protein described above. we conclude that there is no evidence that pulg protein assembles into a stable multiprotein complex or that processing of the pulg precursor causes a detectable change in its subcellular distribution.

AB  == in pseudomonas aeruginosa, several exoproteins synthesized with a signal sequence (elastase, lipase, phospholipases, alkaline phosphatase and exotoxin a) are secreted by a two-step mechanism. they first cross the inner membrane in a signal sequence-dependent way, and are further translocated across the outer membrane in a second step requiring secretion functions encoded by several xcp genes. ten xcp genes have already been characterized (bally et al., 1992a). in this study, two additional xcp genes, xcpp and xcpq, are described. they are located in the 40 min region of the chromosome where they probably define an operon, divergent from the xcpr-z operon previously characterized in this region. these two genes encode two proteins, xcpp and xcpq, similar to pulc and puld of the pul system of klebsiella oxytoca. moreover, the two divergent operons share a common regulation which is growth-phase dependent.

AB  == the enzyme penicillin acylase is synthesized by escherichia coli only at growth temperatures below 30 degrees c. the biochemical basis of this strict temperature-dependent formation of an enzyme was investigated. when the gene (pac) was under the control of the lacuv5 promoter it showed the same temperature-dependent expression as the chromosomally encoded gene transcribed from its own promoter. this indicates that translation of the pac mrna rather than transcription of the gene is temperature-dependent. this conclusion could be further confirmed by northern hybridisation and by analysis of pac-lacz transcriptional fusions. tnphoa insertion mutagenesis and experiments in which the promoter and 5' sequence encoding the signal peptide of the pac gene was exchanged with those of the cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase gene from klebsiella oxytoca localised the region of pac mrna responsible for the temperature-sensitive translation to the 5'-untranslated region and/or the signal peptide. extension of the 5 nucleotide long spacer separating the shine-dalgarno  motif from the aug initiation codon by one or three nucleotides lead to partial or full synthesis of penicillin acylase precursor at 40 degrees c, respectively.  the precursor of penicillin acylase formed at 40 degrees c by the mutant variants or when placed under the control of a heterologous upstream region was associated with the membrane but could not be translocated. taken together these data suggest that transport and translation of the penicillin acylase precursor are coupled and that the short shine-dalgarno-aug distance interferes with a competent interaction between the translation initiation complex and the export system at high temperature. moreover, evidence was also provided which indicates  a direct effect of temperature on the conformation of the precursor and it is proposed that the lack of translation at high temperatures has been selected to prevent the accumulation of transport-incompetent protein locked in the membrane.

TI  == in-vitro evaluation of the four beta-lactamase inhibitors: brl42715, clavulanic acid, sulbactam, and tazobactam.
AB  == the in-vitro synergic activities of brl42715, a new beta-lactamase inhibitor, clavulanic acid, sulbactam, and tazobactam combined with ampicillin, piperacillin, cephalothin, or cefoperazone were tested against various bacteria producing known types of beta-lactamase. brl42715 showed the best synergistic activity among the inhibitors tested against strains producing penicillinases of  type i, ii, iii, v, and that from klebsiella pneumoniae, cephalosporinases, and oxyiminocephalosporinases (except that from klebsiella oxytoca). clavulanic acid  combined with the beta-lactams tested showed the best synergic activity of the inhibitors against strains producing type iv penicillinase and oxyiminocephalosporinase from k. oxytoca. the 50% inhibitory doses of brl42715 were superior to those of clavulanic acid against various types of beta-lactamases except for type iv penicillinase and the oxyiminocephalosporinase from k. oxytoca. the inhibitory activity of brl42715 against cephalosporinases from various bacteria was 10(4) to 10(6)-fold greater than that of clavulanic acid. the synergic effects of brl42715 and clavulanic acid on the activity of piperacillin were compared against six clinical isolates of bacteria resistant to piperacillin. the synergic activity of brl42715 was greater than that of clavulanic acid in all six isolates.

TI  == study of enterobacteriaceae throughout the manufacturing and ripening of hard goats' cheese.
AB  == the evolution of the counts and the species of enterobacteriaceae as well as some physico-chemical parameters (ph, aw and nacl and moisture contents) during manufacturing and ripening of a hard spanish goats' cheese of the armada-sobado variety were studied. enterobacteriaceae (mean log counts 4.45 g-1 in milk) increased 0.71-2.18 log units in curd and afterwards decreased until they disappeared after 2-4 weeks of ripening. this premature disappearance seems to be due to the decrease in aw values and in moisture contents. however, the low ph values, reached from the beginning of the ripening process, could also contribute to this phenomenon. the most abundant species in milk was serratia liquefaciens (57.5% of isolates), followed by morganella morganii (27.5%), hafnia alvei (5%),  klebsiella oxytoca (5%) and yersinia enterocolitica (5%). yersinia enterocolitica was not subsequently isolated from either curd or in cheese. hafnia alvei numbers increased in curd and in 1-week-old cheese where this micro-organism was the most abundant (47.5% and 75% of the isolates respectively). escherichia coli, which was not isolated from milk, curd or 1-week-old cheese, was the predominant organism in 2-week-old cheese (57.8% of isolates). this confirms the finding of other authors who have shown that it is one of the most resistant species in ripening cheeses.

AB  == a controlled clinical comparison was made of the isolator (wampole laboratories,  cranbury, n.j.) and the septi-chek release bottle (roche diagnostics, nutley, n.j.). from 6,345 blood culture sets fulfilling minimum criteria for volume of blood cultured, 840 strains were isolated, of which only 691 (82%) were considered to be representative of bloodstream infection according to centers for disease control definitions. statistically significant differences were found between the systems for the following organisms, which were all detected more frequently in the isolator system: staphylococcus aureus (p = 0.0001), alcaligenes xylosoxidans (p = 0.008), klebsiella pneumoniae (p = 0.05), salmonella spp. (p = 0.03), and candida albicans (p = 0.02). the septi-chek release system required a longer period of time than the isolator system for detection of the following organisms:s. aureus (p = 0.0001), enterococcus spp. (p = 0.0001), enterobacter cloacae (p = 0.03), escherichia coli (p = 0.0001), klebsiella oxytoca (p = 0.03), k. pneumoniae (p = 0.02), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p = 0.002), and c. albicans (p = 0.005). there were 430 episodes of bloodstream  infections identified in the study; of these episodes, only those due to s. aureus were detected significantly more frequently (p = 0.0001) by the isolator system than by the septi-chek release system. however, episodes of bloodstream infections due to s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus spp., and e. coli were detected significantly faster by the isolator system.

TI  == relationship between indole production and differentiation of klebsiella species: indole-positive and -negative isolates of klebsiella determined to be clonal.
AB  == klebsiellae are an important cause of nosocomial infections. the two clinically relevant species, klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca, are differentiated by the ability to produce indole from tryptophan, k. oxytoca being indole positive. we report here the detailed biochemical and molecular analysis of two isolates of klebsiella, cultured from the same urine specimen, that differed only in their ability to produce indole. the two isolates were identical as determined by ribotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and they differed from 10 epidemiologically unrelated strains. probing with the escherichia coli tryptophanase operon, tna, revealed seven restriction fragment length polymorphisms (rflp) among the 12 strains. the two index strains had identical rflp; no single rflp could account for all of the indole-positive or -negative strains. thus, the identification of epidemiologically related strains  of klebsiella differing only in indole production may warrant further examination to determine whether the strains are clonal.

TI  == characterization of pilq, a new gene required for the biogenesis of type 4 fimbriae in pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == type 4 fimbriae are produced by a variety of pathogens, in which they appear to function in adhesion to epithelial cells, and in a form of surface translocation  called twitching motility. using transposon mutagenesis of pseudomonas aeruginosa, we have identified a new locus required for fimbrial assembly. this locus contains the gene pilq which encodes a 77 kda protein with an n-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence characteristic of secretory proteins. pilq mutants lack the spreading colony morphology characteristic of twitching motility, are devoid of fimbriae, and are resistant to the fimbrial-specific bacteriophage po4. the pilq gene was mapped to spel fragment 2, which is located at 0-5 minutes on the p. aeruginosa pao1 chromosome, and thus it is not closely linked to the previously characterized pila-d, pils,r or pilt genes. the pilq region also contains pona, arok and arob-like genes in an organization very similar to that of corresponding genes in escherichia coli and haemophilus influenzae. the predicted amino acid sequence of pilq shows homology to the puld protein of klebsiella oxytoca and related outer membrane proteins which have been found in association with diverse functions in other species including protein secretion,  dna uptake and assembly of filamentous phage. pilq had the highest overall homology to an outer membrane antigen from neisseria gonorrhoeae, encoded by omc, that may fulfil the same role in type 4 fimbrial assembly in this species.

TI  == stable periplasmic secretion intermediate in the general secretory pathway of escherichia coli.
AB  == the secretion of the klebsiella oxytoca cell surface lipoprotein pullulanase involves translocation across the cytoplasmic and outer membranes of the gram-negative bacterial cell envelope. a variant of pullulanase was created by fusing the signal peptide-encoding 5' region of the escherichia coli gene for periplasmic male protein to the 3' end of the pula gene encoding almost the entire mature part of pullulanase. when produced in e. coli carrying the male-pula gene fusion on a high copy number plasmid and the complete set of genes specifically required for pullulanase secretion on a second plasmid, the hybrid protein differed from wild-type pullulanase as follows: (i) it was not fatty-acylated; (ii) it was apparently processed by lepb signal peptidase rather  than by lspa lipoprotein signal peptidase; (iii) it was released into the periplasm and was only slowly transported across the outer membrane, and (iv) it  was released directly into the medium rather than via the usual surface-anchored  intermediate. the hybrid protein was secreted more rapidly when male-pula was expressed from a low copy number plasmid. the two steps in the secretion pathway  could be totally uncoupled by expressing first the male-pula gene fusion and then the cognate secretion genes. these results show that fatty-acylation of wild-type pula is not essential for secretion but may improve its efficiency when large amounts of the protein are produced, that the two steps in secretion can occur quite independently and that the periplasmic intermediate can persist for long periods under certain circumstances.

TI  == analysis of polar lipids from some representative enterobacteria, plesiomonas and acinetobacter by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry.
AB  == fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (fab-ms) was used to analyse lipid extracts of bacteria to assess its usefulness for analysing anionic phospholipids of potential chemotaxonomic value. the following micro-organisms were tested: acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae (2 strains), escherichia coli (3 strains), hafnia alvei, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, plesiomonas shigelloides, proteus mirabilis (3 strains), serratia liquefaciens and serratia marcescens. negative-ion spectra provide data for twenty-seven major carboxylate  anions (m/z 209-325) and for thirty-seven major phospholipid anions (m/z 645-774). generally, the largest carboxylate peaks were due to 16:1, 16:0, cyc17  and 18:1 while the largest phospholipid anion peaks were due to pe(32:1), pe(33:1), pe(34:1), pe(34:2), pg(30:2), pg(31:2), pg(32:2), pg(34:1) and ps(33:0). however, quantitative differences were observed. for example, acinetobacter lacked pe (33:1) but had exceptionally high peaks at m/z 748, ps(33:0), and m/z 281, octadecanoate. unknown 'carboxylate' peaks were detected at m/z 254, 256, 261, 268, 282 and 301. in some cases, unknown peaks appeared to  constitute possible homologous series being separated by delta m/z of 14(identical to methylene). for chemotaxonomic purposes, the complexity of the data required numerical analysis. using the pearson coefficient of linear correlation, as a measure of association, it was possible to compare all strains  analysed. typical results for strain comparisons were as follows: ent. cloacae vs ent. cloacae, r = 0.90 (ent. cloacae vs ac. calcoaceticus, r = 0.46). thus fab-ms represents an excellent means of obtaining large quantities of data on polar lipids of a range of bacterial isolates, which may be suitable for chemotaxonomic purposes.

TI  == analysis of eight out genes in a cluster required for pectic enzyme secretion by  erwinia chrysanthemi: sequence comparison with secretion genes from other gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == many extracellular proteins produced by erwinia chrysanthemi require the out gene products for transport across the outer membrane. in a previous report (s. y. he, m. lindeberg, a. k. chatterjee, and a. collmer, proc. natl. acad. sci. usa 88:1079-1083, 1991) cosmid pcpp2006, sufficient for secretion of erwinia chrysanthemi extracellular proteins by escherichia coli, was partially sequenced, revealing four out genes sharing high homology with pulh through pulk from klebsiella oxytoca. the nucleotide sequence of eight additional out genes reveals homology with pulc through pulg, pull, pulm, pulo, and other genes involved in secretion by various gram-negative bacteria. although signal sequences and hydrophobic regions are generally conserved between pul and out proteins, four out genes contain unique inserts, a puln homolog is not present, and outo appears to be transcribed separately from outc through outm. the sequenced region was subcloned, and an additional 7.6-kb region upstream was identified as being required for secretion in e. coli. out gene homologs were found on erwinia carotovora cosmid clone pakc651 but were not detected in e. coli. the outc-through-outm operon is weakly induced by polygalacturonic acid and strongly  expressed in the early stationary phase. the out and pul genes are highly similar in sequence, hydropathic properties, and overall arrangement but differ in both transcriptional organization and the nature of their induction.

AB  == pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 61 contains a 25-kb cluster of hrp genes that are required for elicitation of the hypersensitive response (hr) in tobacco. tnphoa mutagenesis of cosmid phir11, which contains the hrp cluster, revealed two genes encoding exported or inner-membrane-spanning proteins (h.-c. huang, s. w. hutcheson, and a. collmer, mol. plant-microbe interact. 4:469-476, 1991). the gene in complementation group x, designated hrph, was subcloned on a 3.1-kb sali  fragment into pcpp30, a broad-host-range, mobilizable vector. the subclone restored the ability of hrph mutant p. syringae pv. syringae 61-2089 to elicit the hr in tobacco. dna sequence analysis of the 3.1-kb sali fragment revealed a single open reading frame encoding an 81,956-da preprotein with a typical amino-terminal signal peptide and no likely inner-membrane-spanning hydrophobic regions. hrph was expressed in the presence of [35s]methionine by using the t7 rna polymerase-promoter system and vector pt7-3 in escherichia coli and was shown to encode a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 83,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. the hrph protein in e. coli was located in the membrane fraction and was absent from the periplasm and cytoplasm. the hrph protein possessed similarity with several outer membrane proteins that are known  to be involved in protein or phage secretion, including the klebsiella oxytoca puld protein, the yersinia enterocolitica yscc protein, and the piv protein of filamentous coliphages. all of these proteins possess a possible secretion motif, gg(x)12vp(l/f)lxxipxigxl(f/l), near the carboxyl terminus, and they lack a carboxyl-terminal phenylalanine, in contrast to other outer membrane proteins with no known secretion function. these results suggest that the p. syringae pv.  syringae hrph protein is involved in the secretion of a proteinaceous hr elicitor.

TI  == [effect of meropenem on fecal flora in children].
AB  == meropenem (mepm, sm-7338), a novel parenteral carbapenem antibiotic, was examined for its effect on intestinal flora in children. seven children with infectious diseases (3 male and 4 female children of age's ranging from 4 months to 8 years  and 9 months weighing from 7.3 to 23.0 kg) were treated with mepm at doses ranging 10.3 to 40.5 mg/kg 3 or 4 times a day for 6 to 12 days. before, during and after the treatment, identities and numbers of various bacteria contained in  1 g of feces were determined and fecal beta-lactamase activity and clostridium difficile d-1 antigen were also assayed. changes in fecal flora during mepm treatment was somewhat different depending on cases. regarding enterobacteriaceae among aerobes, all of 7 cases exhibited moderate or pronounced reductions in escherichia coli. some of the cases exhibited the tendency to increase in klebsiella oxytoca. enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii. e. coli which  was reduced during the treatment increased rapidly after the treatment in 5 out of 7 cases, and the initial bacterial counts were restored. diverse strains were  observed within the genus enterococcus, while the overall bacterial counts of this genus exhibited the tendency to increase during the treatment. as a result,  no significant change in total aerobe count was observed in any case except 1 case where enterococcus count was somewhat reduced. among anaerobes, major bacteria such as bacteroides, bifidobacterium, eubacterium and peptococcaceae exhibited tendencies to decrease in some cases during the antibiotic treatment. two infants and 1 child exhibited significant decreases in total anaerobe counts. in most of the cases, such changes in major anaerobes were transient and bacterial counts recovered to their initial values rapidly after completion of the treatment. in no cases, glucose non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli or fungus became predominant. although c. difficile d-1 antigen was observed in 4 cases, its changes had no relationship with characteristics of feces. c. difficile was not detected in any of the cases. mepm was detected in feces in 4 cases being treatment, in concentrations ranging from 0.35 to 66.0 micrograms/g.  fecal mepm levels were very low except in 1 case in which beta-lactamase was negative. from these results, effects of mepm on intestinal flora in children were relatively minor compared to other new beta-lactam drugs. however, a care should be taken to minimize diarrhea and bacterial turnover when a prolonged use  of the antibiotic, was practiced because of potential significant effects on intestinal flora.

TI  == transposition of the gene encoding a tem-12 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase.
AB  == an isolate of klebsiella oxytoca from the blood culture of a child with leukemia  was found to produce two beta-lactamases, at least one of which conferred resistance to ceftazidime. genes encoding both enzymes were located on a single self-transmissible 100-kb plasmid, poz201. this plasmid was introduced into escherichia coli ub5201 (pacyc184), and the gene encoding one beta-lactamase was  transposed onto plasmid pacyc184 by exploiting a gene dosage effect. the transposable gene was found to encode a tem-12 enzyme as determined by nucleotide sequencing. this gene was subsequently transposed onto plasmid pub307. the transposable element encoding the tem-12 enzyme has been designated tn841. both plasmids pacyc184::tn841 and pub307::tn841 were shown to encode a beta-lactamase  with the same isoelectric point and substrate profile as the tem-12 beta-lactamase. transposon tn841, at approximately 7 kb, is larger than tna (4.8  kb) and transposes at a lower frequency. although it produced a resolvase which can complement the resolvase of tn3, its transposase function was not able to complement the transposition of a tna element which lacked transposase. the occurrence of a gene encoding an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase on a transposable element in a clinically significant bacterium is potentially a cause for concern for the spread of resistance to the extended-spectrum cephalosporins.

AB  == coagulase-negative staphylococci (c-ns) are a frequent cause of bacteraemia in premature neonates. it is likely that the strains of c-ns causing bacterial sepsis in premature neonates have their origin on the patient's skin surface. we  have studied the quantitative development of the skin microflora at eight sites on premature neonates. a swab wash method was used to sample and enumerate the cutaneous microflora of premature neonates admitted to an intensive care unit with respiratory distress syndrome. the numbers of bacteria present on the skin increased rapidly by 100-fold in the first week of life. the species of c-ns found on neonatal skin were similar to those found on adult skin. however, the bacterial population was 10(3) lower by comparison. there was considerable variation in numbers of bacteria and in the proportion resistant to antibiotics from day to day. there appeared to be no association between antibiotic usage and the proportion of isolates resistant to antibiotics, although the resident bacteria were in many cases resistant to a variety of antibiotics. c-ns were isolated from 92% of samples from which bacteria were isolated. staphylococcus epidermidis was found at all sites and accounted for 82% of each colonial type of staphylococcus isolated. other organisms isolated included propionibacterium sp,  alpha-haemolytic streptococci, aerobic spore-bearing bacilli, aerobic coryneforms, candida albicans, klebsiella oxytoca, pityrosporum sp, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli. the results of this study suggest that the skin of premature neonates is colonised with antibiotic resistant c-ns during the first week of life and that the chance of contamination of an intravascular catheter at insertion increases during this period.

TI  == extended spectrum beta-lactamase from klebsiella oxytoca, not belonging to the tem or shv family.
AB  == in clinical isolates of klebsiella oxytoca resistance to cefuroxime and aztreonam was mediated by a beta-lactamase, designated kh, (pi 5.25) which could be transferred into escherichia coli by electroporation, but not by conjugation. the transformants produced two enzymes with pis 5.25 and 8.4 respectively, and showed resistance to cefuroxime, aztreonam, cefotaxime and ceftazidime. substrate and inhibition profiles indicated that kh beta-lactamase was different from tem- or shv-like enzymes, but similar to chromosomal k1 beta-lactamase. the enzyme profile with pi 8.4 was similar to the enzyme from the recipient and showed elevated activity in transformants. the plasmid profiles of the transformants were different from those of their donors. however, a plasmid fragment of the k.  oxytoca isolate kh11 hybridized with a plasmid ranging in size from 4.8 to 7.8 kilobases in all the transformants and most of the donors. gene probes encoding tem-1 or shv-1 did not hybridize with plasmid dna from the k. oxytoca isolates. furthermore, a probe of the ampc gene did not hybridize with the plasmid but to dna fragments of the same size in whole cell dna preparations from the e. coli xac recipient and the tkh11 transformants. this indicates that no gross rearrangements in the chromosomal beta-lactamase gene region had occurred in the  transformants which could explain the increased expression of the pi 8.4 beta-lactamase.

TI  == pulo, a component of the pullulanase secretion pathway of klebsiella oxytoca, correctly and efficiently processes gonococcal type iv prepilin in escherichia coli.
AB  == the pulo protein required for extracellular secretion of pullulanase by klebsiella oxytoca is known to be highly homologous to two type iv prepilin peptidases, namely xcpa(pild) (pseudomonas aeruginosa) and tcpj (vibrio cholerae). the predicted prepilin peptidase activity of pulo was confirmed by showing that it could correctly process the product of the cloned pile.1 type iv  pilin structural gene from neisseria gonorrhoeae in escherichia coli. the p. aeruginosa prepilin peptidase and another putative prepilin peptidase, comc from  bacillus subtilis, also processed prepile. subcellular fractionation showed that  the pile gene product that had been processed by pulo remained associated with the cytoplasmic membrane, as did the unprocessed precursor. pulo was also shown to process three of the four prepile-phoa hybrids tested. southern hybridization  experiments suggest that a pulo homologue is present in the n. gonorrhoeae chromosome.

TI  == review of the in vitro antibacterial activity of cefprozil, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  == cefprozil is a newer oral cephalosporin with a spectrum of activity against organisms that include gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. a review of published data shows that cefprozil is active (susceptibility, less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml; moderate susceptibility, 16 micrograms/ml; resistance, greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml) against gram-positive species such as  streptococci, methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, and listeria monocytogenes;  it may have marginal activity against some enterococci. among the gram-negative species, cefprozil has activity against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis. for anaerobic species, cefprozil has activity against clostridial species, including clostridium difficile, peptostreptococci, and possibly bacteroides melaninogenicus and eubacterium. the  activity of cefprozil is generally greater than that of cephalexin and generally  similar to that of cefaclor. in these reports, cefprozil showed more in vitro activity than cephalexin and cefaclor against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, penicillin-resistant viridans streptococci, beta-lactamase-positive methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and c. difficile, although the clinical significance of some of these differences has yet to be studied.

AB  == the in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a c-3 bicyclic pyridinium group, was compared with ceftazidime, cefpirome, and cefepime. cefquinome inhibited members of the enterobacteriaceae at less than or  equal to 0.5 microgram/ml for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, salmonella shigella, proteus mirabilis, morganella, and providencia. although most citrobacter freundii and enterobacter  cloacae were inhibited by less than 2 micrograms/ml, some strains resistant to ceftazidime were resistant, [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) greater than  16 micrograms/ml]. serratia marcescens were inhibited by less than 1 microgram/ml and pseudomonas aeruginosa by 8 micrograms/ml similar to the activity of cefepime. the majority of haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by less than 0.25 microgram/ml. most enterococci had cefquinome mics of 4-8 micrograms/ml. cefquinome was extremely active against group-a streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae with mics less than 0.12 microgram/ml. 90% of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus 90% were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. overall, the in vitro activity of cefquinome was comparable with aminothiazolyl cephalosporins. it inhibited some enterobacter and citrobacter freundii resistant to ceftazidime as did cefpirome and cefepime. cefquinome was not destroyed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of klebsiella, branhamella, and pseudomonas, but  it was hydrolyzed by tem-3, tem-5, and tem-9. its activity was not adversely decreased in different medium or protein, and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) for most species except for enterobacter were within a dilution of mics.

TI  == isolation and characterization of kika, a region on incn group plasmids that determines killing of klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  == transfer of the incn group plasmid pcu1 from escherichia coli to klebsiella oxytoca by conjugation kills a large proportion (90 to 95%) of the recipients of  plasmid dna, whereas transfer to e. coli or even to the closely related enterobacter aerogenes does not. two regions, kika and kikb, have been identified on pcu1 that contribute to the kik (killing in klebsiellas) phenotype. we have localized the kika region to 500 bp by deletion analysis and show by dna-dna hybridization that kika is highly conserved among the plasmids of incompatibility group n. the expression in k. oxytoca of kika under the control of the strong inducible e. coli tac promoter results in loss of cell viability. the nucleotide  sequence showed two overlapping open reading frames (orfs) within the kika region. the first orf codes for a putative polypeptide of 104 amino acids (orf104). the second orf codes for a 70-amino-acid polypeptide (orf70). the properties of the putative protein encoded by orf104 and gene fusions of kika to  alkaline phosphatase by using tnphoa suggest that killing may involve an association with the bacterial membrane; however, we could not rule out the possibility that orf70 plays a role in the kik phenotype.

TI  == conversion of xylan to ethanol by ethanologenic strains of escherichia coli and klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  == a two-stage process was evaluated for the fermentation of polymeric feedstocks to ethanol by a single, genetically engineered microorganism. the truncated xylanase gene (xynz) from the thermophilic bacterium clostridium thermocellum was fused with the n terminus of lacz to eliminate secretory signals. this hybrid gene was  expressed at high levels in ethanologenic strains of escherichia coli ko11 and klebsiella oxytoca m5a1(ploi555). large amounts of xylanase (25 to 93 mu/mg of cell protein) accumulated as intracellular products during ethanol production. cells containing xylanase were harvested at the end of fermentation and added to  a xylan solution at 60 degrees c, thereby releasing xylanase for saccharification. after cooling, the hydrolysate was fermented to ethanol with the same organism (30 degrees c), thereby replenishing the supply of xylanase for a subsequent saccharification. recombinant e. coli metabolized only xylose, while recombinant k. oxytoca m5a1 metabolized xylose, xylobiose, and xylotriose but not xylotetrose. derivatives of this latter organism produced large amounts of intracellular xylosidase, and the organism is presumed to transport both xylobiose and xylotriose for intracellular hydrolysis. by using recombinant m5a1, approximately 34% of the maximal theoretical yield of ethanol was obtained from xylan by this two-stage process. the yield appeared to be limited by the digestibility of commercial xylan rather than by a lack of sufficient xylanase or by ethanol toxicity. in general form, this two-stage process, which uses a single, genetically engineered microorganism, should be applicable for the production of useful chemicals from a wide range of biomass polymers.

TI  == ru 29 246, the active compound of the cephalosporin-prodrug-ester hr 916. i. antibacterial activity in vitro.
AB  == the aminothiazolyl-cephalosporin ru 29 246 is the active metabolite of the prodrug-pivaloyl-oxyethyl-ester hr 916. ru 29 246 in vitro activity includes a wide range of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens. against methicillin-sensitive staphylococci ru 29 246 (mic90 of 0.25 approximately 2 micrograms/ml) was clearly more active than cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, cefixime and ceftibuten, but slightly less active than cefdinir. ru 29 246 inhibited hemolytic streptococci of the serogroups a, b, c and g as well as penicillin-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations similar to cefdinir, cefpodoxime and cefuroxime (mic90 less than or equal to 0.13 micrograms/ml), but less than the other oral cephalosporins investigated (cefixime, cefaclor and ceftibuten). mic90s of ru 29 246 against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, salmonella spp., shigella spp.,  proteus mirabilis and haemophilus influenzae were less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. only ru 29 246 and cefdinir demonstrated moderate activity against acinetobacter baumannii (mic90 greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml). most strains of pseudomonas spp., serratia marcescens, enterobacter spp., hafnia alvei and bacteroides spp. were resistant to ru 29 246. ru 29 246 killed escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus at a rate of 99% to 99.9% at concentrations of two times mic. the ph value of the medium (range 5.5 to 8.5) and the inoculum size (range 10(5) to 10(7) cfu/ml) had no or only low influence on the antibacterial activity of ru 29 246. ru 29 246 is a broad spectrum cephalosporin including in its activity both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens and therefore--depending on the bioavailability of its prodrug--looks promising as to its therapeutic perspective.

TI  == an enzyme with type iv prepilin peptidase activity is required to process components of the general extracellular protein secretion pathway of klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  == the last gene (pulo) of the pulc-o pullulanase secretion gene operon of klebsiella oxytoca codes for a protein that is 52% identical to the product of the pild/xcpa gene required for extracellular protein secretion and type iv pilus biogenesis in pseudomonas aeruginosa. the pild/xcpa protein is known to remove the first six amino acids of the signal sequence of the type iv pilin precursor by cleaving after the glycine residue in the conserved sequence gf(m)xxxe (where  x represents hydrophobic amino acids). this prepilin peptidase cleavage site is present in the products of four genes in the pulc-o operon (pulg, pulh, pull and  pulj proteins). it is shown here that pulo processes the pulg gene product in vivo. processing was maximal within 15 seconds, but experiments in which the expression of pulo was uncoupled from that of the other genes in the secretion operon suggest that processing can also occur post-translationally. the products  of two pulg derivatives with internal inframe deletions were also processed by pulo, but the three pulg-phoa hybrids, two pulj-phoa hybrids and the single pulh-phoa hybrid tested did not appear to be processed. sucrose gradient fraction experiments showed that both precursor and mature forms of pulg appear to be associated with low-density, outer membrane vesicles prepared by osmotic lysis of sphaeroplasts. neither the xcpa gene nor the bacillus subtilis gene comc, which is also homologous to pulo and codes for a protein with type iv prepilin peptidase activity, can correct the pullulanase secretion defect in an escherichia coli strain carrying all of the genes required for secretion except pulo. furthermore, neither xcpa nor comc is able to process prepulg protein in vivo.

TI  == pullulanase secretion in escherichia coli k-12 requires a cytoplasmic protein and a putative polytopic cytoplasmic membrane protein.
AB  == the previously uncharacterized third and fourth genes (pule and pulf) of the pullulanase secretion gene operon of klebsiella oxytoca strain unf5023 are, respectively, predicted to encode a 55 kda polypeptide with a putative nucleotide-binding site, and a highly hydrophobic 44 kda polypeptide that probably spans the cytoplasmic membrane several times. expression of pule in minicells or under the control of a strong bacteriophage t7 promoter resulted in  the production of a c. 58 kda cytoplasmic protein. a representative pule-beta-galactosidase hybrid protein created by tnlac mutagenesis was also found mainly in the cytoplasm. these results are in line with the predicted absence from pule of a region of sufficient hydrophobicity to function as a signal sequence. the pulf polypeptide could not be detected either in minicells or when the gene was transcribed from the t7 promoter, but the acquirement of three pulf-lacz gene fusions that encoded hybrid proteins with relatively high levels of beta-galactosidase activity indicates that this gene can be transcribed and translated. gene disruption experiments indicated that both pule and pulf are required for pullulanase secretion in escherichia coli k-12. both proteins exhibit considerable homology throughout their entire lengths with other proteins involved in protein secretion, pilin assembly, conjugation and transformation competence in a variety of bacteria. in addition, pule protein has consensus sequences found in a wide variety of nucleotide-binding proteins. this study completes the initial characterization of the pullulanase secretion gene operon,  which comprises 13 genes that are all essential for the transport of pullulanase  across the outer membrane.

TI  == adhesion of bacteria on pectin casted films.
AB  == pectin and non-pectin degrading bacteria were tested for their ability to adhere  to a film casted of low methoxylated pectin (polygalacturonic acid). klebsiella oxytoca and a newly isolated strain of escherichia coli adhered to the film, whereas only k. oxytoca was able to utilize pectin as a sole carbon source. other e. coli strains, containing plasmids with pectinolytic enzymes, did not adhere to the solid pectin film. therefore, the ability of the bacteria to adhere to the films was not correlated with their ability to degrade pectin. when the solubilization (dissolution) of pectin matrices (tablets) was analysed with and without k. oxytoca, a significant retardation in the dissolution rate was observed in the presence of k. oxytoca, suggesting the formation of a biofilm on  the matrix or sedimentation of insoluble pectin salts.

TI  == inhibition of acid secretion from parietal cells by non-human-infecting helicobacter species: a factor in colonization of gastric mucosa?
AB  == helicobacter pylori has been shown to produce a protein that inhibits acid secretion from parietal cells. we have examined other non-human-infecting helicobacter species for this property by measuring the uptake of [14c]aminopyrine into rabbit parietal cells as an indirect assessment of acid secretion. helicobacter felis and an isolate from a rhesus monkey were shown to inhibit acid secretion. isolates of helicobacter mustelae gave variable responses. whole bacteria and cell-free sonicates impaired the uptake of [14c]aminopyrine. we also tested other bacteria, including escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, klebsiella oxytoca, and campylobacter jejuni. as whole organisms, these control bacteria had little effect on acid secretion, but sonicates caused pronounced inhibition that was partially heat labile. pronase treatment of h. pylori destroyed its inhibitory effect. these results suggest that most helicobacter species, but not all isolates, are able to inhibit acid secretion from rabbit parietal cells. this property may be a factor in the establishment of long-term infection by these species.

TI  == fimbrial types among respiratory isolates belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == bacterial attachment is believed to be an early step in gram-negative nosocomial  pneumonia. the frequency of fimbria-associated adhesins among respiratory pathogens has not been studied in detail. in this study isolates belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae, prospectively obtained from intensive care unit patients who were suspected of having nosocomial pneumonia, were examined for fimbria-associated adhesins. type 3, p, type 1, and other fimbrial phenotypes were identified by specific hemagglutination and electron microscopy. the klebsiella type 3 fimbrial phenotype was further characterized by using a monoclonal antibody. also, both type 3 and escherichia coli p fimbrial genotypes  were detected by using dna colony blot assays. the frequencies of genera or species isolated were as follows: enterobacter (38.6%), klebsiella (26.8%), serratia (17.7%), e. coli (13%), and proteus (5.2%). isolates of klebsiella oxytoca, k. pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae most commonly possessed the type 3 fimbrial phenotype and genotype. the phenotype and genotype for e. coli p fimbriae (46.2 and 50%, respectively), a known pathogenic determinant in the urinary tract, were detected more frequently than expected. in addition, a previously unspecified hemagglutinin that was specific for porcine erythrocytes was almost uniformly expressed among isolates of enterobacter aerogenes. finally, the expression of the type 1 fimbrial phenotype was widely detected among the isolates tested but notably absent among k. oxytoca and proteus mirabilis isolates. the frequency of the various fimbrial types identified suggests a role  for these bacterial organelles in adherence to respiratory epithelia.

TI  == comparative study of the structure/function relationship of wild-type and structurally modified maltopentaose-producing amylase.
AB  == amylase a-180, which is secreted by a new alkaliphilic organism, isolate 163-26,  consists of a single type of polypeptide chain of 186.5 kda and hydrolyses starch by exo-attack releasing malto-pentaose as preferential product. the structure/function relationship of this unusual starch-degrading enzyme was analysed by introducing 3' deletions into the structural gene. it was found that  removal of up to a 110-kda portion from the c-terminus leaving 563 n-terminal amino acids still led to the formation of a fully active enzyme. the part of the  structural gene coding for these 563 n-terminal amino acids was fused with the signal peptide-encoding segment of the cyclodextrin glucanotransferase gene from  klebsiella oxytoca and was cloned into an expression vector. the resulting truncated a-180 derivative, a-180/21, was efficiently transported through the cytoplasmic membrane and released into the medium by an escherichia coli strain which 'leaks' periplasmatic components. a-180/21 was purified and its catalytic properties, i.e. specific activity and product specificity, proved to be identical to those of the wild-type enzyme; however, in contrast to the wild-type enzyme, it was unable to bind to raw starch and it displayed an altered temperature and ph dependence of activity.

TI  == further observations on enhancement of the infectivity of fusobacterium necrophorum by other bacteria.
AB  == it had already been shown with a single virulent strain (a42) of fusobacterium necrophorum that suspension of the fusobacteria in sub-lethal doses of broth cultures of other bacteria reduced the minimum infective dose (greater than 10(6) organisms) for mice by subcutaneous inoculation, sometimes to less than 10 organisms. the present study extended the known range of bacteria with strong infectivity-enhancing properties to include bacillus cereus, klebsiella oxytoca and staphylococcus aureus; and those with weaker effect to include bacillus subtilis, 'bacteroides melaninogenicus', clostridium sporogenes, pasteurella haemolytica, and proteus mirabilis. the study also showed that five further virulent strains of f. necrophorum closely resembled a42 in respect of striking susceptibility to infectivity enhancement by escherichia coli. actinomyces (corynebacterium) pyogenes and s. aureus. one further strain (a6) of f. necrophorum resembled a42 in respect of strong infectivity enhancement by a. pyogenes, s. aureus, b. cereus and k. oxytoca but differed from it and the other  five strains in being only slightly affected by e. coli. this work was a necessary prelude to the development of a method, based on infectivity enhancement, for the detection and isolation of f. necrophorum present in small numbers in heavily contaminated material such as faeces.

TI  == concomitant dissemination of three extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among different enterobacteriaceae isolated in a french hospital.
AB  == from january 1988 to august 1989, 267 non-repetitive strains of enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbla) derived from tem (ctx-1/tem-3, caz-6) or shv (caz-5) were isolated from 219 colonized or  infected patients. esblas were characterized by analytical isoelectric focusing.  biotypes, resistance phenotypes and plasmid patterns were determined in order to  differentiate the isolates in each species. among the 116 ctx-1-producing enterobacteriaceae, 48 strains were differentiated: 27 from 74 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, seven from 22 enterobacter aerogenes isolates, and 14 from a combined total of seven k. oxytoca, five serratia marcescens, six escherichia coli, 1 enterobacter cloacae and 1 citrobacter freundii. caz-5 has been isolated  since january 1988 in 16 different strains among 101 k. pneumoniae isolates. caz-6 was first identified in k. pneumoniae (january 1988). among the 48 enterobacteriaceae producing caz-6, 12 strains were differentiated: four from 39  e. aerogenes isolates, three from four k. pneumoniae, and five from a combined total of two s. marcescens, two e. coli and one e. cloacae. during this outbreak, ctx-1 was found to be encoded by 85 kb (inc 7/m) or greater than or equal to 150  kb (inc 6/c) plasmids. caz-6 was always encoded by an 85 kb (inc 7/m) plasmid and caz-5 by a greater than 150 kb plasmid. these results show that strain epidemics  and plasmid dissemination occurred mainly in k. pneumoniae and e. aerogenes for ctx-1, in e. aerogenes for caz-6, and in k. pneumoniae for caz-5. they also suggest that the bla(tem) gene (ctx-1) has spread between different plasmids present in the same ecosystem.

AB  == ocp 9-176 is an oxycephem antibiotic that contains a 2-aminothiazolyl, carboxypropyl side chain at c-7 and a pyridinium thiomethyl group at c-3. ocp 9-176 was generally twofold less active than its sulfur-containing analog me 1228 against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, providencia  stuartii, proteus vulgaris, and serratia marcescens. activity against enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii was equivalent. ocp 9-176 was twofold less active than me-1228 against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter species. activity of the two agents was similar against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. although ocp 9-176 inhibited e. coli containing tem-1 and tem-2, it was less active than me-1228. klebsiella organisms with shv-1 and k-2 beta-lactamases were inhibited, but tem-3-containing isolates had mics of 16  micrograms/ml. ocp 9-176 was minimally hydrolyzed by tem-1, pse-1, k-1, and p99,  and it was a poor inhibitor of p99. replacement of sulfur with oxygen does not increase the activity of compounds with sulfopyridinium methyl groups at c-3.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of gr69153, a new long-acting cephalosporin.
AB  == gr69153, a new parenteral cephalosporin, inhibited 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, shigellae, and salmonellae at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml (mic90). it had activity comparable to those of ceftazidime, cefpirome, cefepime, and e-1040. against cephalosporinase-producing enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens, mics ranged from 0.12 to greater than 32 micrograms/ml, and  cefpirome and cefepime were the most active agents against these species. pseudomonas aeruginosa was highly susceptible to gr69153, and for this organism the mic90 was less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, which was similar to the e-1040 mic90, but most pseudomonas cepacia and xanthomonas maltophilia isolates were resistant. gr69153 inhibited haemophilus influenzae and moraxella branhamella at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. for staphylococcus aureus gr69153 mics were similar to those of ceftazidime and e-1040. enterococci and listeriae were resistant to gr69153, but streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml. the activity of gr69153 was not affected by serum. gr69153 was not inactivated by the beta-lactamases of staphylococcus aureus, tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, and bro-1, but it was hydrolyzed by tem-3, tem-9, and morganellae. gr69153 had overall activity comparable to those of commercially available parenteral cephalosporins or those found in clinical investigations. it is more active against bacteroides than most available aminothiazolyl parenteral cephalosporins are. gr69153 is hydrolyzed by the new plasmid beta-lactamases, and thus, its primary value may be related to its pharmacological properties.

TI  == characterisation of a unique ceftazidime-hydrolysing beta-lactamase, tem-e2.
AB  == a strain of klebsiella oxytoca, originally isolated in liverpool in 1982, has been found to produce a novel transferable beta-lactamase, tem-e2. this enzyme confers resistance to ceftazidime and focused as a doublet band with an iso-electric point (pi) of 5.3. the strain also produced the tem-1 beta-lactamase. both tem-1 and tem-e2 beta-lactamases were encoded by a transferable 103 kb plasmid; these two enzymes also had similar molecular weights, were inhibited by clavulanic acid, and hydrolysed ampicillin, carbenicillin and cephaloridine at similar rates. however, unlike the tem-1 enzyme, the tem-e2 beta-lactamase hydrolysed ceftazidime and cefotaxime with similar efficiency, although it conferred much greater resistance to ceftazidime  in the host strain. this is the earliest documented example of a tem-like enzyme  which confers transferable resistance to ceftazidime and related cephalosporins.

TI  == beta-lactamase production in members of the family enterobacteriaceae and resistance to beta-lactam-enzyme inhibitor combinations.
AB  == recent reports that members of the family enterobacteriaceae that produce high levels of certain beta-lactamases are often resistant to ticarcillin-clavulanate  prompted this study to assess the relationship between type and amount of enzyme  produced and susceptibility to ticarcillin-clavulanate, piperacillin-tazobactam,  and cefoperazone-sulbactam. agar dilution mics were determined by using 73 strains of enterobacteriaceae that produced a single beta-lactamase that had been characterized and quantified and a beta-lactamase-negative control strain of escherichia coli. for e. coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, mics of each combination increased as levels of tem, shv-1, or class iv enzymes increased. however, the percentage of strains that were resistant was highest for ticarcillin-clavulanate (32%), with only 18 and 6% resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam and cefoperazone-sulbactam, respectively. strains producing pse-1, regardless of level, were resistant or moderately susceptible to ticarcillin-clavulanate but were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam and cefoperazone-sulbactam. hms-1 and ohio-1 beta-lactamases were associated with resistance to ticarcillin-clavulanate and piperacillin-tazobactam, respectively. high levels of class iv enzymes in klebsiella oxytoca were associated with resistance to all three combinations. these results indicate that the level and type of beta-lactamase produced by members of the family enterobacteriaceae are important determinants of susceptibility to beta-lactam-inhibitor combinations, especially ticarcillin-clavulanate.

AB  == a total of 33 clinical isolates encoding tem-3 (ctx-1) from four french hospitals were studied. the strains belonged to seven species, klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 24), escherichia coli (n = 3), serratia marcescens (n = 2), citrobacter freundii  (n = 1), enterobacter aerogenes (n = 1), enterobacter cloacae (n = 1), and klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1). all the strains harbored an inc7 or m self-transferable plasmid with a size of approximately 85 kilobases. the plasmids had closely related ecori, hincii, hindiii, and pvuii restriction endonuclease-generated patterns and conferred resistance to all beta-lactams, except cephamycins and imipenem; to tetracycline, because of the presence of the  genes blatem-3 and tetc, respectively, as determined by hybridization with specific probes; and to sulfonamide. depending on the presence or absence and level of expression of the genes aaca4, aada, and dfri and of insertion element is15, four types of plasmids could be distinguished. plasmid pcff04, the prototype plasmid encoding tem-3, was widespread and appeared, by southern hybridization, as the progenitor of the other types of replicons. the plasmid epidemic responsible for dissemination of tem-3 in clinical isolates of members of the family enterobacteriaceae may have originated in s. marcescens since pcff04 was first detected in this species.

TI  == growth of gram-negative bacteria in dry cow secretion.
AB  == gram-negative bacteria (n = 192) isolated from infected bovine mammary glands were tested for growth in a pooled source of dry cow secretion. growth of klebsiella pneumoniae in dry cow secretion was greater than growth of escherichia coli and klebsiella oxytoca. escherichia coli originating during the early dry period exhibited greater growth in dry cow secretion than those originating around calving or during lactation. klebsiella pneumoniae growth did not differ with time of origin of intramammary infection. escherichia coli, k. oxytoca, and  k. pneumoniae growth in a synthetic medium was reduced by apolactoferrin plus ig. growth reduction was greatest for e. coli. citrate reversed growth inhibition. the inhibitory properties of dry cow secretion for e. coli may contribute to the  low number of naturally occurring intramammary infections originating during the  early part of the dry period. inhibitory properties of dry cow secretion are partially explained by lactoferrin acting in conjunction with antibody to prevent iron acquisition by many gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == glutathione transferase in bacteria: subunit composition and antigenic characterization.
AB  == the presence of glutathione transferase (gst; ec 2.5.1.18) in escherichia coli atcc 25922, e. coli atcc 25422, proteus vulgaris atcc 8427, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, klebsiella oxytoca cip 666, k. oxytoca af 101, enterobacter cloacae cip 6085, serratia marcescens cip 6755, and proteus mirabilis af 2924 was investigated. using 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene as substrate, gst activity was found in the glutathione-(gsh-)affinity-purified fraction of all strains tested. sds-page analysis of gsh-affinity-purified enzyme indicated that the gsts of all these bacteria are dimers of two identical subunits of mr about 22,500. rabbit antiserum directed against the major isoenzyme present in proteus mirabilis af 2924, pm-gst-6.0, was used to investigate the antigenic properties of bacterial gsts. western blot analysis indicated that a gst antigenically identical to pm-gst-6.0 is present in enterobacter cloacae cip 6085, escherichia coli atcc 25422 and proteus vulgaris atcc 8427, but absent in escherichia coli atcc 25922, klebsiella oxytoca cip 666, k. oxytoca af 101 and serratia marcescens cip 6755. the presence of pm-gst-6.0, but not mammalian gst, increased the mic values of amikacin, ampicillin, cefotaxime, cephalothin and nalidixic acid for e. coli atcc 25922. it is suggested that bacterial gst may represent a defense against the effects of antibiotics.

TI  == [antibacterial effect of cefixime in the presence of the type of beta-lactamases  produced by enterobacteriaceae].
AB  == the susceptibility of isolates or enterobacteriaceae to orally absorbed beta-lactams (amoxicillin, cephalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, and cefixime), was maximum for the iminomethoxy-aminothiazolyl-cephalosporin but variable according  to bacterial species. for e. coli, p. mirabilis, salmonella, shigella, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca (group 1) mic50 were congruent to 0.06 mg/l, and mic90 congruent to 0.12 mg/l. finally for c. freundii, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, m. morganii, mic50 were higher, congruent to 1, and mic90 16 mg/l. the slight increase reported between mic50 ans mic90 of cefixime against isolates belonging to group 1 was related to stability towards beta-lactamases (tem, shv)  unlike groups 2 and 3, where the drug was less stable to chromosomal type 1 enzyme. the discovery of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esb) (e.g. shv-2, ctx-1 or tem-3), mainly in k. pneumoniae, led to further investigations of the behavior of cefixime. the in vitro activity of cefixime (cfm), amoxicillin (amx)  combined or not with clavulanate (amc, 2 mg/l), ticarcillin (tic), cephalothin (cf), cefotaxime (ctx), ceftazidime (caz) and aztreonam (azm) was determined by the agar dilution method (inoculum 10(5) cfu/ml) against clinical isolates: e. coli (26), k. pneumoniae (42), k. oxytoca (9), salmonella (3) producing several types of beta-lactamases, chromosomal (cephalosoporinase, broad-spectrum) or plasmid-encoded (tem-1, tem-2, ctx-1, shv-2, shv-3, shv-4). the geometric mean mic values of amx, amc, tic, cf, ctx, caz, azm and cfm were as follows: greater than 480, 21.6, greater than 285, 45.6, 0.53, 1.12, 0.51, and 0.77 respectively.  an mic increase of oxyimino beta-lactams (ctx, caz, azm, cfm) was observed against over-producing isolates of k. oxytoca and isolates producing esb (ctx-1,  shv-2, shv-3, shv-4). the comparative behavior of cefixime was determined after transfer by conjugation to e. coli k-12. sixty-one derivatives were constructed producing tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, ctx-1, tem-4, caz-2, shv-2, shv-3, shv-4, the mics of cefixime were stable against derivatives producing a penicillinase (tem-1, tem-2, shv-1), but not against those producing an esb. the mic increases of undigestible beta-lactams ranged from 1 to 135 fold (cfm), 40 to 200 fold (ctx) 12 to 232 fold (caz), and 4 to 240 fold (azm).

TI  == in-vitro activity of meropenem imipenem, the penem hre 664 and ceftazidine against clinical isolates from west germany.
AB  == the antibacterial activity in vitro of meropenem was compared with another carbapenem, imipenem, the penem hre 664, and ceftazidime. mics were not influenced by ph nor by inoculum size below 5 x 10(5) cfu/ml: higher inocula caused a modest increase in mic. cation supplementation of mueller-hinton broth was without effect. meropenem was more active than imipenem and the other comparative agents against the majority of gram-negative species (in particular proteus, providencia, morganella, haemophilus, neisseria and pseudomonas aeruginosa, including isolates from patients with cystic fibrosis). against gram-positive organisms, the activity of meropenem was equal to or slightly less  that of imipenem. neither meropenem nor imipenem were influenced by the extended  spectrum beta-lactamases that confer resistance to third generation cephalosporins produced by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca or serratia marcescens.

TI  == mutants of the tem-1 beta-lactamase conferring resistance to ceftazidime.
AB  == spontaneous ceftazidime resistant mutants were obtained from an escherichia coli  k12 j62-2 expressing the tem-1 beta-lactamase (mutation frequency = 10(-9). these mutants produced beta-lactamases with similar molecular weights, kinetic parameters and isoelectric points (pi) to the beta-lactamases produced by ceftazidime resistant clinical isolates which have recently been identified in this laboratory. mutant enzyme a focused as a doublet band at pi 5.3 with an additional weak pi 5.4 band. the doublet co-focused with the tem-e2 beta-lactamase, produced by a ceftazidime resistant klebsiella oxytoca isolate, which was originally obtained in a liverpool hospital. mutant enzyme b had a pi identical to the tem-e1 beta-lactamase produced by a ceftazidime resistant clinical isolate of e. coli found in belgium. these results suggest that the two  beta-lactamases in the clinical strains may have come from simple mutations of the tem-1 beta-lactamase gene.

TI  == survival of coliforms and bacterial pathogens within protozoa during chlorination.
AB  == the susceptibility of coliform bacteria and bacterial pathogens to free chlorine  residuals was determined before and after incubation with amoebae and ciliate protozoa. viability of bacteria was quantified to determine their resistance to free chlorine residuals when ingested by laboratory strains of acanthamoeba castellanii and tetrahymena pyriformis. cocultures of bacteria and protozoa were  incubated to facilitate ingestion of the bacteria and then were chlorinated, neutralized, and sonicated to release intracellular bacteria. qualitative susceptibility of protozoan strains to free chlorine was also assessed. protozoa  were shown to survive and grow after exposure to levels of free chlorine residuals that killed free-living bacteria. ingested coliforms escherichia coli,  citrobacter freundii, enterobacter agglomerans, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella  pneumoniae, and klebsiella oxytoca and bacterial pathogens salmonella typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, shigella sonnei, legionella gormanii, and campylobacter jejuni had increased resistance to free chlorine residuals. bacteria could be cultured from within treated protozoans well after the time required for 99% inactivation of free-living cells. all bacterial pathogens were  greater than 50-fold more resistant to free chlorine when ingested by t. pyriformis. escherichia coli ingested by a cyclidium sp., a ciliate isolated from a drinking water reservoir, were also shown to be more resistant to free chlorine. the mechanism that increased resistance appeared to be survival within  protozoan cells. this study indicates that bacteria can survive ingestion by protozoa. this bacterium-protozoan association provides bacteria with increased resistance to free chlorine residuals which can lead to persistence of bacteria in chlorine-treated water. we propose that resistance to digestion by predatory protozoa was an evolutionary precursor of pathogenicity in bacteria and that today it is a mechanism for survival of fastidious bacteria in dilute and inhospitable aquatic environments.

TI  == [susceptibility of gram-negative bacterial isolates to six beta-lactam and two aminoglycoside antibiotics at our university hospital].
AB  == susceptibilities of gram-negative bacterial strains isolated at the university hospital in 1987 to six beta-lactam antibiotics (azthreonam cefmetazole, ceftizoxime, latamoxef, aminobenzyl-penicillin and piperacillin) and two aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin and amikacin) were examined by agar dilution and the agar diffusion method. results obtained from both methods correlated well in most of the strains. most of the strains belonging to escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis were sensitive to the beta-lactam antibiotics except aminobenzyl-penicillin and piperacillin. they were also sensitive to aminoglycoside antibiotics. most strains of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens were sensitive to azthreonam, latamoxef and aminoglycosides, but were less sensitive to other beta-lactams. acinetobacter calcoaceticus was generally resistant to beta-lactams except ceftizoxime, but was sensitive to aminoglycosides. more than half of the strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to azthreonam, piperacillin and aminoglycoside antibiotics and only latamoxef was active in pseudomonas maltophilia.

TI  == simple assay of beta-lactamase with agar medium containing a chromogenic cephalosporin, pyridinium-2-azo-p-dimethylaniline chromophore (padac).
AB  == a new beta-lactamase assay method with agar plates containing pyridinium-2-azo-p-dimethylaniline chromophore (padac) (50 microm), a beta-lactamase-labile, chromogenic cephalosporin, was examined. on the padac plates inoculated with beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria (10(4) cfu per spot) and incubated at 37 degrees c, a yellow zone showing hydrolysis of padac by beta-lactamase was formed around the colony. the zone diameter increased with incubation time. examination with enterobacter cloacae gn7471 revealed that  beta-lactamase activity was present in the agar around the colony, decreasing exponentially with increasing distance from the colonial margin; this suggests that the padac hydrolysis zone is formed by an extracellular enzyme. at 18 h, significant correlations were obtained between the zone diameters of the 10 species (clinical isolates) examined and their periplasmic beta-lactamase activities determined spectrophotometrically. the addition of clavulanic acid (0.5 to 10 micrograms/ml) inhibited zone formation on the padac plates inoculated with type iiia, va, vb, pse-1, and ic beta-lactamase producers. when the clinical isolates were tested on plates with clavulanic acid (2 micrograms/ml), inhibition was observed in 41 to 58% of the escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates and in all isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, and proteus vulgaris. thus, the use of the inhibitor made it  possible to detect penicillinase or type ic cephalosporinase producers. these results proved that the padac plate might be a useful tool permitting easy, semiquantitative determination of beta-lactamase activity.

TI  == interactions of new plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases with third-generation cephalosporins.
AB  == the kinetic constants of three recently identified plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases--shv-2, ctx-1, and caz-1--markedly active against third-generation cephalosporins were analyzed in comparison with three better-characterized beta-lactamases--two plasmid-mediated enzymes, tem-2 and pit-2/shv-1, and r-30, a beta-lactamase from klebsiella oxytoca that has few similarities to the newer enzymes. all of these enzymes are synthesized constitutively, demonstrate efficient hydrolysis of penicillins, are highly susceptible to the action of clavulanic acid and sulbactam, and have no detectable activity against the cephamycins and imipenem. with the methoxyimino cephalosporins, including those of the third generation, the rates of hydrolysis  observed for the shv-2, ctx-1, and caz-1 enzymes are high and show no relation to those observed for the other presently known beta-lactamases. structure-activity  relations suggest that the oxime substituent of these cephalosporins is a major structural factor in the catalytic process observed with the three new beta-lactamases.

TI  == cloning and characterization of an albicidin resistance gene from klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  == a dna fragment containing a gene for resistance to the antibiotic albicidin was isolated from klebsiella oxytoca and shown to be expressed in escherichia coli, where it also protected bacteriophage t7 replication from inhibition by albicidin. in vivo translation analysis demonstrated that the cloned 2.2kb dna fragment coded for a 36 kilodalton (kd) protein and a 25kd protein. the dna sequence was determined for a 654-base-pair open reading frame contained within a 1.2kb subcloned dna fragment encoding albicidin resistance. the predicted molecular weight of the polypeptide translated from the open reading frame was 25.8kd. a putative shine-dalgarno sequence precedes the open reading frame but a  potential promoter sequence was not detected. a possible rho-independent transcription termination signal was found directly following the stop codon. the functional protein for albicidin resistance was isolated and purified. both the molecular weight and nh2-terminal amino acid sequence of this protein correspond  with that predicted from the dna sequence of the open reading frame. the cloned albicidin resistance gene had no effect on the tsx (nupa) nucleoside uptake gene  associated with spontaneous albicidin resistance in e. coli; also, it did not complement any of a range of e. coli dnats mutants at restrictive temperatures. the cloned resistance gene product remained intracellular in exponential cultures of k. oxytoca and e. coli. cell-free extracts from e. coli containing the resistance gene protected a sensitive strain of e. coli from inhibition by albicidin, as did the purified albicidin resistance protein. the mechanism of this albicidin resistance protein involved binding to albicidin to form a complex without antibiotic activity, but without catalysing further chemical modification of the antibiotic.

TI  == epidemiology of fecal strains of the family enterobacteriaceae in 22 neonatal wards and influence of antibiotic policy.
AB  == the gram-negative fecal floras from 953 infants were studied upon discharge of the infants from 22 neonatal wards. more than 600 distinct phenotypes of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., and enterobacter spp. were distinguished by high-resolution biotyping. the colonization patterns observed showed considerable local and temporal variation. the major (m) strains (phenotypes), which colonized more than 10% and up to 78% of the infants in a ward (median, 23%), were klebsiella oxytoca (15 strains), e. coli (4 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1 strain), and enterobacter cloacae (1 strain). resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics was more pronounced among m strains than among strains of enteric bacteria colonizing few or single infants only. local antibiotic policy influenced the colonization patterns. despite the fact that m strains of klebsiella spp. were usually resistant to ampicillin as well as to cephalexin and cefuroxime, their local dissemination was associated with the use of ampicillin with or without gentamicin but not with the use of cefuroxime. it thus appeared that in the neonatal setting, ampicillin posed a greater risk of local spread of  certain drug-resistant bacterial clones than a newer cephalosporin, such as cefuroxime.

TI  == beta-lactamase inhibition by acetylmethylene penicillanic acid compared to that of clavulanate and sulbactam.
AB  == the beta-lactamase inhibitory properties of 6-acetylmethylene penicillanic acid (6-ampa) were investigated and compared with those of other beta-lactamase inhibitors. 6-ampa inhibited the tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, pse-1, pse-2, pse-3, pse-4, oxa-2, oxa-3, and staphylococcus aureus beta-lactamases. it also inhibited the chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases of the richmond-sykes type ia, ic and id type and the type iv klebsiella enzymes. beta-lactamases of branhamella catarrhalis and bacteroides fragilis were inhibited. the 6-ampa i50 values for various enzymes were less than 0.01 microgram/ml tem-1 and pse-4, and 0.01 microgram/ml shv-1, 0.02 microgram/ml s. aureus, 0.04 microgram/ml proteus vulgaris, 0.04 microgram/ml k. oxytoca, 6.8 micrograms/ml p99, and 9.7 micrograms/ml sabath-abraham pseudomonas enzyme. with isolated beta-lactamases 6-ampa was a more potent inhibitor than clavulanate or sulbactam. 6-ampa was an irreversible inhibitor of beta-lactamases. the penetration index for escherichia  coli jt4 was 23 compared to 3 for clavulanate. 6-ampa at 10 micrograms/ml acted synergistically with ampicillin against beta-lactamase containing bacteria, but it was less active than clavulanate and did not act synergistically with ampicillin against enterobacter, citrobacter or pseudomonas. although 6-ampa has  excellent beta-lactamase inhibitory properties with isolated enzymes, it is less  useful with intact organisms.

AB  == cs-807 is a new oral prodrug of r-3746, a cephalosporin derivative, with potent in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the susceptibility of about 1,200 clinical isolates to r-3746 was determined by the agar dilution method. ninety percent or more of pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, indole-positive and indole-negative proteus spp., providencia rettgeri, and haemophilus influenzae were inhibited at  concentrations ranging less than or equal to 0.01 to 1.56 micrograms/ml. furthermore, at a concentration of 3.13 micrograms/ml, 50% or more of staphylococcus epidermidis, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens strains were also inhibited. pseudomonas aeruginosa and xanthomonas maltophilia were resistant to r-3746. the activity of r-3746 was scarcely influenced by several growth conditions. r-3746 was highly resistant to  hydrolysis by beta-lactamases derived from various species of bacteria. killing-curve studies demonstrated bactericidal activity of r-3746 at concentrations above the mic. r-3746 showed high affinity for penicillin-binding  proteins 1, 3, and 4 of staphylococcus aureus and 1a, 1bs, and 3 of escherichia coli. systemic infections in mice caused by various pathogens, including beta-lactamase-producing strains, responded well to therapy with oral doses of cs-807.

TI  == non-ige-dependent bacteria-induced histamine release from human lung and tonsillar mast cells.
AB  == a wide spectrum of formalin-killed bacteria have been tested for their ability to release histamine from human dispersed lung and tonsillar mast cells. escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus vulgaris, klebsiella oxytoca and k. pneumoniae were the most effective histamine releasers. further studies on tonsillar mast cells showed that e. coli-induced histamine release differed from ige-dependent release with respect to its kinetics, temperature and ph profiles and its sensitivity to calcium deprivation and metabolic inhibitors. a lectin-mediated mechanism may operate, but other non-immunological mechanisms might also be involved in the release. escherichia coli and anti-ige did not synergize in inducing histamine release. the production of pgd2 and the failure to detect lactate dehydrogenase following incubation of mast cells with e. coli suggests that histamine release is not due to cytotoxicity.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of diethyldithiocarbamate and dimethyldithiocarbamate against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus has appeared which is highly resistant to both methicillin  and aminoglycosides. current therapy involves long-term intravenous therapy of vancomycin. since vancomycin is currently the only drug used to treat these patients, there is a need to develop additional antimicrobial therapy. the in vitro antimicrobial effect of the metal chelator, diethyldithiocarbamate (ddtc) and its structural analog dimethyldithiocarbamate (dmtc) were investigated. both  ddtc and dmtc were effective against s. aureus including methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). by agar diffusion, ddtc at 10 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 12 to 21 mm and at 100 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 26 to  34 mm against mrsa. the dmtc produced slightly greater zone sizes against mrsa of 16 to 24 mm and 24 to 37 mm for 10 micrograms per disk and 100 micrograms per disk, respectively. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) for dmtc against mrsa was 6 micrograms per ml. both ddtc and dmtc were also effective against enterococci, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, salmonella species, serratia marcescens and citrobacter freundii at 100 micrograms per disk. the mics of dmtc for klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, salmonella and citrobacter freundii were approximately 128 micrograms per ml while the mics for proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens was greater than or equal to 256 micrograms per ml. in addition, dmtc was synergistic with gentamicin against mrsa and coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. additive and synergistic effects of dmtc were displayed with gentamicin against s. aureus including methicillin-resistant  s. aureus.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == phage tf-1 is a filamentous phage which is about 800 nm in length, 10 nm in width and has slightly tapered ends. the phage was isolated from sewage and formed plaques or propagated only on escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium and klebsiella oxytoca strains harbouring the inct plasmid pin25 at 30 degrees c. it  adsorbed in large numbers to pin25-encoded long thick flexible conjugative pili formed at 30 degrees c and also to the short form of these pili synthesized at 37 degrees c. the reason for the failure to form plaques at 37 degrees c is not known. the adsorption site is a short length of the pilus shaft extending 100-200 nm back from the distal tip. efficient phage tf-1 adsorption to the same site was found for pili determined by other inct plasmids in spite of the fact that phage  tf-1 did not plate or propagate on strains harbouring them. however, areas of specific partial clearing on lawns of these plasmid-containing bacteria were produced by phage in high concentrations. lack of plaque-formation could be due to inefficient intracellular assembly coupled to avid adsorption of any liberated phage to pili. the phage differs from all but one other filamentous phage by being sensitive to diethyl ether.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new difluoro oxacephem, 6315-s.
AB  == 6315-s, a novel difluoromethyl thioacetamido oxacephem, had in vitro activity comparable to that of cefotaxime and moxalactam against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, salmonella spp., and shigella spp., inhibiting 90% at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. it inhibited piperacillin- and cefoperazone-resistant isolates in these species. 6315-s did not inhibit cefotaxime- or moxalactam-resistant citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, or enterobacter cloacae (mics for 90% of the strains tested were greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml). proteus vulgaris resistant to cefotaxime was inhibited. pseudomonas species and acinetobacter species were resistant (mics greater than 64 micrograms/ml). mics for 90% of the staphylococcus aureus and s.  epidermidis isolates were 4 micrograms/ml. 6315-s was highly active against anaerobic species of clostridium, fusobacterium, bacteroides, and peptostreptococci and was superior to other agents against these organisms. 6315-s was not hydrolyzed by the major plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases, but it induced chromosomal beta-lactamases in enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == phenotypic characteristics of coliform and noncoliform bacteria from a public water supply compared with regional and national clinical species.
AB  == during the summer and fall of 1984, elevated total coliform counts were observed  in the distribution system of a public water supply serving 350,000 people in south central connecticut. as part of an investigation of possible health risks associated with the presence of bacteria in the water supply, bacterial isolates  from the distribution system were compared with bacterial isolates of the same species obtained from a large regional teaching hospital and from a national compendium of clinical isolates. characteristics analyzed included phenotypic metabolic activity, antimicrobial susceptibilities to clinically utilized antibiotics, temperature tolerance at 44.5 degrees c, and beta-glucuronidase activity in single-test form and on a selective medium. environmental isolates lacked known plasmid-mediated characteristics, with the exception of one escherichia coli isolate which showed some antibiotic resistance. klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, and enterobacter agglomerans from all sources were temperature tolerant and yielded positive fecal coliform tests. only e. coli showed beta-glucuronidase activity (both in a single biochemical test and on a selective medium). no single characteristic analyzed was sufficient to establish an organism as either environmental or clinical in origin.

TI  == in-vitro antibacterial activity of bo-1165, a new monobactam antibiotic.
AB  == bo-1165 has excellent antibacterial activity against gram-negative bacteria but it is almost inactive against gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria. bo-1165 was more active than the four reference drugs against escherichia coli, salmonella spp., shigella spp., klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, indole-positive  and indole-negative proteus. also, bo-1165 exhibited high antibacterial activity  against strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic50, 3.12 mg/l) and p. cepacia (mic50, 1.56 mg/l), but did not against ps. maltophilia strains. bo-1165 had good stability to plasmid-mediated and chromosome-mediated beta-lactamases. however, the compound was slightly hydrolyzed by the beta-lactamases isolated from proteus vulgaris, ps. cepacia, klebsiella oxytoca and ps. maltophilia, which were capable of hydrolyzing aztreonam.

AB  == a total of 755 gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were tested against aztreonam by the disc agar diffusion test. the strains of bacteria used in this study consisted of escherichia coli (314), enterobacter aerogenes (30), e. agglomerans (7), e. cloacae, (39), citrobacter diversus (9), c. freundii (13), hafnia alvei (3), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10), klebsiella oxytoca (6), k. ozaenae (5), k. pneumoniae (107), morganella morganii (3), moraxella sp. (10), pasteurella multocida (1), proteus mirabilis (66), p. vulgaris (4), providencia rettgeri (12), p. stuartii (5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (85), p. fluorescens (2),  p. maltophila (7), salmonella sp. (1) and serratia marcescens (17). in vitro activity against aztreonam was compared with amikacin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tobramycin. over 99% of e. coli and enterobacter species were susceptible to aztreonam. all the 118 strains of klebsiella, 87 strains of proteus-providencia and 17 strains of s. marcescens were also susceptible. aztreonam also showed good activity against p.  aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of the 85 isolates tested.

AB  == studies on the synergism of ciprofloxacin with beta-lactam antibiotics, gentamicin, minocycline and pipemidic acid. using escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae/klebsiella oxytoca, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus strains, we examined a possible influence of pipemidic acid, minocycline, gentamicin, cefazolin, mezlocillin and ampicillin on the antibiotic activity of ciprofloxacin. we found in all bacterial species synergistic influence by pipemidic acid. when ciprofloxacin was combined with gentamicin, synergism was observed in e. coli and in k. pneumoniae/oxytoca, additive effects in p. aeruginosa and s. aureus. in combination with minocycline we demonstrated synergism in s. aureus only. in all other bacterial species and antibiotic combinations we found neither synergism nor antagonism.

TI  == opportunistic infections in hysterectomy-derived, barrier-maintained guinea pigs.
AB  == guineapigs were rederived by hysterectomy and associated with a colonization-resistant enteric microflora (crf) of mouse origin to establish a strict barrier-maintained breeding colony. infections were suspected in 55 of 209 animals autopsied. from 65 of 67 tissue samples selected for bacteriological examination 167 isolates, belonging to 16 usually non-pathogenic bacterial species or groups, were isolated mostly from cases of mastitis, typhlitis, enteritis, otitis media and pneumonia. faecal streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridium perfringens, citrobacter spp., c. freundii, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca and enterobacter cloacae accounted for 86.8% of all isolates. variations in the recovery rate of these 8 species during the study and a gradual decline in the incidence of infections were observed. elimination by rederivation of the autochthonous bacterial flora seemed to have predisposed to opportunistic infections by aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria. enteric colonization resistance to the growth of these bacteria was presumably insufficiently provided by the crf of mouse origin and might be remedied by using a flora of guineapig origin.

TI  == serum bactericidal activity of ceftazidime increased by netilmicin.
AB  == cephalosporins are often used in combination with aminoglycoside antibiotics in the treatment of gram-negative infections. although ceftazidime possesses activity against gram-negative bacteria, especially against pseudomonas, combined use with aminoglycosides is useful. in this study, 12 healthy volunteers (6 men,  6 women; mean age 21.5 yr) received a single dose of ceftazidime 1 g iv and one week later ceftazidime 1 g iv with netilmicin 100 mg iv. both antibiotics were infused over five minutes. concentrations of ceftazidime were determined by high  performance liquid chromatography. serum bactericidal activity (sba) was evaluated against seven microorganisms isolated from clinical specimens. the mean peak serum level of ceftazidime was 113.4 micrograms/ml. at eight hours, we observed a concentration of 2.6 micrograms/ml. the total clearance was 126 ml/min, while the renal clearance was 100 ml/min. ceftazidime exhibited a half-life of 1.9 hours. up to ten hours, the sba of ceftazidime against escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, and salmonella typhi was greater than 1:8 in more than 90 percent of samples. at one hour, ceftazidime exhibited a sba of 1:4 for staphylococcus aureus, and 1:16 for pseudomonas aeruginosa. with the addition of netilmicin, median sba against staph. aureus and p. aeruginosa were 1:32 and 1:64, respectively, at one hour. netilmicin enhanced  the sba of ceftazidime. the combination was not effective against streptococcus faecalis.

TI  == the activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy 7 beta acyl ureido cephalosporin.
AB  == the activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy ureido cephalosporin, was determined against 726 clinical isolates. ninety percent of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, salmonella, and shigella species were inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin and piperacillin against these species. concentrations of 25 micrograms/ml of cefbuperazone were needed to inhibit serratia marcescens and providencia species, and 50% of enterobacter cloacae had mics greater than 25 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was less active by 8 to 32-fold than cefotaxime or moxalactam against most enterobacteriaceae. cefbuperazone did not inhibit acinetobacter or pseudomonas species. hemolytic streptococci were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml  and staphylococci by 25 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone had activity comparable to cefoxitin and moxalactam against bacteroides fragilis with mic90s of 6.3 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was not hydrolyzed by plasmid or chromosomal beta-lactamases and was an inhibitor of the p99 e. cloacae beta-lactamase with an i50 of 1 microgram/ml. it was a less effective inhibitor of the k. oxytoca k1 and e. coli tem-1 beta-lactamases than was clavulanic acid. cefbuperazone induced beta-lactamases in p. aeruginosa and resistant e. cloacae. a permeability barrier in e. cloacae, c. freundii and p. aeruginosa is suggested by the potentiation of  cefbuperazone's activity by edta.

AB  == the existence of the plasmid incompatibility group d was reaffirmed as a result of compatibility experiments done on plasmids r687, r711b, r778b and r840 which were previously tentatively accepted as constituting the group. the group was further delineated by the isolation of a phage, phage d, which adsorbed specifically to incd plasmid-encoded pili produced by escherichia coli k12 strains and strains of salmonella typhimurium, proteus morganii and klebsiella oxytoca harbouring one of these plasmids. plaque formation, like that of phage pilh alpha, was temperature sensitive in that plaques formed at 26 degrees c but  not at 37 degrees c. plaques were fairly clear, regular in outline and varied from pinpoint to about 1.5 mm in diameter on e. coli hosts where plaques were detected, but on the other hosts the plaques were more turbid and often irregular in outline. the phage did not plate (or propagate) on incd plasmid-carrying strains of providencia alcalifaciens, providencia stuartii or serratia marcescens. the phage had an isometric hexagonal outline with a diameter of about 27 nm. it contained rna and resembled two other rna-containing phages, m and pilh alpha, by being sensitive to chloroform. it adsorbed to the sides of the very distal ends of the shafts of incd plasmid-coded pili.

TI  == population analysis of susceptibility to cefotaxime in enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == population analysis of susceptibility to cefotaxime (ctx) in eight species of enterobacteriaceae was carried out. one strain of each species was examined. the  strains represented their individual species as regards natural susceptibility to ampicillin (a) and carbenicillin (ca). cephalothinase activity of the parental strains and strains selected on the plates with the highest concentration that allowed growth was determined by an ultraviolet assay. the populations of the a-susceptible/ca-susceptible (a-s/ca-s) species, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis were homogeneous as regards susceptibility to ctx. the a-resistant/ca-resistant (a-r/ca-r) species, klebsiella oxytoca and citrobacter koseri, were less homogeneous, but in all four mentioned species no increase in cephalothinase activity was observed between the parental strains and the strains selected in the population analysis. the four a-r/ca-s species, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii, were heterogeneous. the frequency of ctx-r mutants was approx. 10(-6.5). the ic50 for  ctx was 2(7.5)-2(8.5) times higher for the mutants than for the parental strains. the ctx resistance was maintained in subcultures of the strains. all four species had a very high increase in cephalothinase activity from parental strains to the  strains selected in the population analysis. only the enzyme of proteus vulgaris  was able to hydrolyze ctx.

TI  == new, simple medium for selective recovery of klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca from human feces.
AB  == a culture medium was developed which selectively favored the growth of klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca in escherichia coli-rich fecal cultures, without the use of antibiotics. the discriminative capacity of this medium was based on the presence of only two carbon sources, citrate and inositol, which can be utilized by nearly all k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca strains but not by e. coli. the medium consisted of simmons citrate agar (sca) with 1% inositol (scai). klebsiella strains from fecal samples subcultured on scai grew unhampered as yellow, dome-shaped, often mucoid colonies, whereas e. coli appeared as tiny, watery colonies. apart from some enterobacter strains, no other types of bacteria were found to mimic the typical appearance of klebsiellae. recovery experiments from stool samples revealed a limiting ratio of klebsiella to e. coli of 1:10(6)  or more when samples were plated on scai versus ratios of 1:10(2) to 1:10(3) on blood agar or macconkey agar. compared with an existing klebsiella culture method, the combination of sca and macconkey-inositol-carbenicillin (mic) agar, klebsiella yields with scai were not lower than those with the combination of mic and sca. furthermore, the efficiency of the scai method was twice that of the latter combination. the scai plate could be a valuable tool in studies on the epidemiology of k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca, for example in nosocomial infections, especially those concerning immunocompromised patients.

TI  == [fundamental and clinical studies on t-1982 (cefbuperzone), a new cephamycin antibiotic, in the field of pediatrics].
AB  == studies on t-1982 (cefbuperazone), a new cephamycin antibiotic, were carried out  in the field of pediatrics, and the following results were obtained. 1. peak mic  of t-1982 against s. pyogenes (group a) lately isolated was 0.39 micrograms/ml, and the drug was active even against highly resistant strains of macrolides, lincomycin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol. 2. peak mics of t-1982 were 0.78 microgram/ml against b. pertussis, 0.2 microgram/ml against e. coli and less than or equal to 0.05 microgram/ml against k. oxytoca, and the drug was also active against ampicillin-resistant bacteria. 3. serum levels and urinary excretions of  t-1982 were investigated in 6 cases. when given at a dose of 20-28 mg/kg by 1 hour intravenous drip infusion, serum concentrations of t-1982 attained the peak  level of 63.5-75.9 micrograms/ml at the end of administration and sustained the level of 0.9-2.6 micrograms/ml at 6 hours, the serum half-life (t 1/2) ranging 70-82 minutes. approximately 20-72% of the dose were excreted in the active form  into urine within 6 hours. 4. twenty-seven cases of acute pediatric infections were treated with t-1982 mainly by intravenous drip infusion, and satisfactory clinical results were obtained in all the cases of angina lacunaris, bronchitis,  bronchopneumonia, pertussis, sepsis caused by serratia and acute urinary tract infections caused by ampicillin-resistant e. coli. the efficacy rate was 96.3%. in this study the drug was administered chiefly at a daily dose of 50-70 mg/kg 2-3 times a day for 2-12 days. 5. gram-positive cocci (s. aureus, s. pneumoniae,  s. pyogenes) and gram-negative rods (h. influenzae, h. parainfluenzae p. vulgaris, b. pertussis, s. marcescens, e. coli) were eradicated by the treatment  with t-1982. 6. no noticeable side effects were observed, except for temporary increase of eosinophil in 2 cases and slight elevation of got in 1 case.

TI  == comparative epidemiology of gentamicin-resistant enterobacteria: persistence of carriage and infection.
AB  == during a two-year period from january 1979, 260 patients have been involved in an outbreak of carriage and infection due to gentamicin-resistant enterobacteria. we have examined the duration of carriage of such enterobacteria and have compared the carriage of klebsiella with that of other resistant enterobacteria. carriage  of gentamicin-resistant enterobacteria occurred most frequently and was least sporadic in the intestinal tract. vaginal carriage was observed in 49 out of 68 patients tested and occurred more frequently in older patients. oral carriage was noted in 36% of patients but was more sporadic than intestinal carriage. rates of oral carriage were greater among moribund patients. carriage at skin sites was related to their proximity to the perineum. intestinal carriage of gentamicin-resistant escherichia coli and klebsiellae but not klebsiella oxytoca  nor citrobacter persisted for long periods (half lives of 140 and 100 days respectively). cessation of carriage of gentamicin-resistant klebsiellae was due  to loss of both the organism and its plasmid rather than a shedding of the plasmid. chronic bacteriuria with gentamicin-resistant e coli and klebsiellae (half life 180 days) but not klebsiella oxytoca nor citrobacter persisted for long periods.

TI  == behaviour of ceftazidime towards beta-lactamases.
AB  == from escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, proteus morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but the geometric mean of the inhibition constant ki used to measure  this interaction was 120 and almost 700 times higher with ceftazidime than with cefotaxime and cefuroxime, respectively. two other beta-lactamases isolated from  pr. vulgaris and klebsiella oxytoca also showed little or no interaction with ceftazidime. a complementary microbiological technique, the "double-disc" technique, indicated that ceftazidime was more stable than cefotaxime to all beta-lactamases tested. moxalactam, however, appeared to have slightly greater stability.

TI  == [utilization and fermentation of 2-ketogluconate by "enterobacteriaceae" (author's transl)].
AB  == two methods were compared: 1) the ability to use 2-ketogluconate (2-kg) as source of carbon and energy in defined medium, and 2) the ability to produce acid by fermentation of 2-kg (0.5 g/100 ml) in peptone water with phenol red. results of  growth on, and acid production from, 2-kg were identical. a total of 990 strains  was studied. no strain of escherichia coli, shigella (4 species), salmonella (4 sub-genera), yersinia pestis, y. pseudotuberculosis, edwardsiella (2 species), proteus vulgaris, p. mirabilis, p. morganii, providencia (2 species) could utilize 2-kg. all strains of citrobacter (2 species), levinea amalonatica, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, k. ozaenae, enterobacter (5 species), serratia (6 species) utilize 2-kg as sole carbon source. different reactions were given by strains of p. rettgeri, y. enterocolitica and k. rhinoscleromatis.

TI  == evaluation of the four-hour micro-id technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative, gram-negative rods from blood cultures.
AB  == a 4-h micro-id technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative gram-negative rods from positive blood cultures was compared to subculture and species identification of single colonies by api 20e and micro-id, using standardized inocula. a total of 127 patients (220 positive cultures) were studied. isolates included 96 escherichia coli, 46 klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 klebsiella oxytoca, 8 enterobacter aerogenes, 17 enterobacter cloacae, 19 serratia marcescens, 2 serratia liquefaciens, 8 proteus mirabilis, 1 salmonella species, 1 morganella morganii, 6 haemophilus influenzae, 2 haemophilus parainfluenzae, 3 bacteroides fragilis, 3 acinetobacter calcoaceticus biotype anitratus, and 1 pseudomonas maltophilia. in 90% of the cultures, identification  by micro-id was identical to that obtained after subculture; if the 15 non-enterobacterial isolates were excluded, the corresponding figure was 96.6%. enterobacteria identified incorrectly by direct micro-id were three s. marcescens (two identified as s. liquefaciens, one as hafnia alvei), two s. liquefaciens (both identified as e. cloacae), and two k. pneumoniae (one identified as klebsiella ozaenae, the other as serratia rubidaea). none of the 15 non-enterobacterial cultures were correctly identified by micro-id (non-identifiable, or classified as providencia/yersinia/klebsiella species). although biochemical discrepancies between direct and final micro-id tests occurred in 41% of the enterobacterial cultures, this did not seriously interfere with identification. direct species identification of enterobacteriaceae from blood cultures by direct micro-id is accurate and easily performed and identified organisms within 4 h compared to at least 24 h by most other methods; the direct  micro-id technique would be rendered even more valuable by the additional capability of identifying non-enterobacterial gram-negative isolates.

TI  == chemical structure and inhalation toxicity of lipopolysaccharides from bacteria on cotton.
AB  == lipopolysaccharides from different bacteria isolated from cotton were purified and chemically analyzed. their pulmonary toxicity to animals was tested in inhalation tests. lipopolysaccharides from agrobacterium and xanthomonas were shown to differ from the others in that they contained no heptose and no non-hydroxylated fatty acids with a chain length of 12, 14, or 16 carbon atoms. lipopolysaccharides from pseudomonas putida, enterobacter agglomerans, and klebsiella oxytoca were found to cause an influx of polymorphonuclear leukocytes  into the airways. lipopolysaccharides from agrobacterium sp. and xanthomonas sinensis caused no significant invasion. the data point to substances in both the lipid a part and the core part of the lipopolysaccharides being responsible for the capacity to induce leukocyte invasion into the airways.

TI  == [interest of gamma-glutamyltransferase in "enterobacteriaceae" (author's transl)].
AB  == gamma-glutamyltransferase (gammagt) could be detected in 86,6% of 3,027 strains of enterobacteriaceae, by the use of gamma-l-glutamin-p-nitranilide acid for substrate. the following species produced gamma gt: citrobacter freundii, levinea malonatica, l. amalonatica, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, k. ozaenae, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, e. agglomerans, e. gergoviae, k. ozaenae, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, e. agglomerans, e. gergoviae, hafnia alvei, erwinia carotovora, serratia marcescens, s. liquefaciens, s. plymuthica, s. marinorubra, s. odorifera, s. ficaria, proteus vulgaris, p. mirabilis, p. morganii, p. rettgeri, providencia alcalifaciens, p. stuartii, yersinia enterocolitica and y. pseudotuberculosis. most strains of escherichia coli and alkalescens dispar group are gamma gt+. the following species did not produce gammagt: shigella sonnei, edwardsiella tarda, klebsiella rhinoscleromatis and yersinia pestis. within the salmonella, most strains of subgenus i, ii and iv, and diphasic strains of subgenus iii (s. arizonae) produced gamma gt, whereas monophasic strains of subgenus iii did not produce gammagt. salmonella enteritidis (gammagt+) and s. dublin (gammagt-) can readily be distinguished. this test (gammagt) could also serve as a biochemical marker for s. typhi-murium  strains. shigella dysenteriae serotypes 3 to 9 were gammagt+ whereas other serotypes were gammagt-. within s. flexneri serotype 6, varieties boyd 88 and newcastle were found gammagt+; and varieties sussex and manchester were gammagt-. the use of gammagt test as an epidemiological marker for other shigella serotypes is suggested.
