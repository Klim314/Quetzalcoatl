TI  - Characterization of Romboutsia ilealis gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from the gastro-intestinal tract of a rat, and proposal for the reclassification of five closely related members of the genus Clostridium into the genera Romboutsia gen. nov., Intestinibacter gen. nov., Terrisporobacter gen. nov. and Asaccharospora gen. nov.
AB  - A Gram-positive staining, rod-shaped, non-motile, spore-forming obligately anaerobic bacterium, designated CRIBT, was isolated from the gastro-intestinal tract of a rat and characterized. The major cellular fatty acids of strain CRIBT were saturated and unsaturated straight-chain C12-C19 fatty acids, with C16:0 being the predominant fatty acid. The polar lipid profile comprised six glycolipids, four phospholipids and one lipid that did not stain with any of the specific spray reagents used. The only quinone was MK-6. The predominating cell-wall sugars were glucose and galactose. The peptidoglycan type of strain CRIBT was A1sigma lanthionine-direct. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain CRIBT was 28.1 mol%. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, strain CRIBT was most closely related to a number of species of the genus Clostridium, including Clostridium lituseburense (97.2%), Clostridium glycolicum (96.2%), Clostridium mayombei (96.2%), Clostridium bartlettii (96.0%) and Clostridium irregulare (95.5%). All these species show very low 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity (<85%) to the type strain of Clostridium butyricum, the type species of the genus Clostridium. DNA-DNA hybridization with closely related reference strains indicated reassociation values below 32%. On the basis of phenotypic and genetic studies, a novel genus, Romboutsia gen. nov., is proposed. The novel isolate CRIBT (=DSM 25109T=NIZO 4048T) is proposed as the type strain of the type species, Romboutsia ilealis gen. nov., sp. nov., of the proposed novel genus. It is proposed that C. lituseburense is transferred to this genus as Romboutsia lituseburensis comb. nov. Furthermore, the reclassification into novel genera is proposed for C. bartlettii, as Intestinibacter bartlettii gen. nov., comb. nov. (type species of the genus), C. glycolicum, as Terrisporobacter glycolicus gen. nov., comb. nov. (type species of the genus), C. mayombei, as Terrisporobacter mayombei gen. nov., comb. nov., and C. irregulare, as Asaccharospora irregularis gen. nov., comb. nov. (type species of the genus), on the basis of additional data collected in this study. In addition, an emendation of the species Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and the order Eubacteriales is provided.
TI  - Formation of amphetamine from its nitro analogue by anaerobic intestinal bacteria.
AB  - 1. Microbial reduction of 1-phenyl-2-nitropropane 1 was carried out using 40 strains of intestinal anaerobic bacteria. Among them, 12 strains (Mitsuokella multiacidus, Clostridium perfringens, C. innocuum, C. clostiriiforme, C. difficile, C. butyricum, C. sp., Eubacterium limosum, E. aerofaciens, E. multiforme, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and P. productus) had the ability to reduce 1 to amphetamine 2 (0.1-1% yield). 2. Clostridium species were more active than another intestinal anaerobic bacteria. 3. When Clostridium perfringens was used in preparative fermentation, the yield of 2 was increased, and its absolute structure had an (S)-configuration with an optical purity of 68% in enantiomeric excess.
TI  - On the occurrence of enoate reductase and 2-oxo-carboxylate reductase in clostridia and some observations on the amino acid fermentation by Peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  - Enoate reductase present in Clostridium kluyveri and Clostridium spec. La 1 could be detected in three strains of C. tyrobutyricum and ten clostridia belonging to the groups of proteolytic and saccharolytic or proteolytic species, respectively. In C. pasteurianum, C. butyricum and C. propionicum enoate reductase could not be found even after growth on (E)-2-butenoate. A 2-oxo-carboxylate reductase was present in rather low activities in the non-proteolytic clostridia which produce enoate reductase. High activities (up to 10 U/mg protein) of 2-oxo-carboxylate reductase were found in six of ten proteolytic clostridia. The substrate specificities of the enoate reductase and the 2-oxo-carboxylate reductases from the proteolytic clostridia were determined with different alpha, beta-unsaturated carboxylates (enoates) and 2-oxo-carboxylates, respectively. Enoates as well as 2-oxo-carboxylates are intermediates of the pathway by which amino acids are degraded. An explanation is offered for the long known but not understood fact that in the Stickland reaction isoleucine always acts as an electron donor and leucine and phenylalanine can be electron acceptors as well as donors. Peptostreptococcus anaerobius converting some amino acids to the same products as C. sporogenes did this also with the intermediates which were found for the reductive deamination of amino acids in C. sporogenes, however, in crude extracts reduction of enoates occurred only in an activated form.
