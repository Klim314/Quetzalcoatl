TI  == phosphorylcholine-containing antigens in bacteria from the mouth and respiratory  tract.
AB  == phosphorylcholine (pc)-containing antigens were sought in 269 bacterial isolates  from the mouth and respiratory tract by an enzyme immunoassay method. only 41 (15%) isolates were pc-positive and of these 29 (70%) were strains of haemophilus influenzae. other species that produced positive results included two of five isolates of gemella haemolysans, two of five isolates of micrococcus spp., and a  single strain each of bacillus sp., corynebacterium jeikeium, lactococcus sp. and h. parainfluenzae. the presence of pc-containing antigens in h. influenzae may be an important source of cross-reaction in antigen detection techniques that detect the c-polysaccharide antigen of streptococcus pneumoniae in respiratory specimens and would result in false positive results.
