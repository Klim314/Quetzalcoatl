TI  == potential of bulb-associated bacteria for biocontrol of hyacinth soft rot caused  by dickeya zeae.
AB  == aims: dickeya zeae is a pectinolytic bacterium responsible for soft rot disease in flower bulb crops. in this study, the possibility of controlling soft rot disease in hyacinth by using antagonistic bacteria isolated from hyacinth bulbs was explored. methods and results: bacterial isolates with potential for biocontrol were selected on the basis of antibiosis against d. zeae, siderophore  production, and the n-acyl homoserine lactones (ahls)-inactivation. in in vitro assays, 35 out of 565 hyacinth-associated bacterial isolates produced antimicrobial substances against d. zeae, whereas 20 degraded ahls, and 35 produced siderophores. isolates of interest were identified by 16s rdna sequence  analysis and reaction in biolog tests. twenty-six isolates that differed in characteristics were selected for pathogenicity testing on hyacinth cultivars, pink pearl and carnegie. two strains identified as rahnella aquatilis and one as  erwinia persicinus significantly reduced tissue maceration caused by d. zeae 2019 on hyacinth bulbs, but not on leaves. conclusions: hyacinth bulbs harbour bacteria belonging to different taxonomic groups that are antagonistic to d. zeae, and some can attenuate decay of bulb tissue. significance and impact of the study: selected hyacinth-associated bacterial isolates have potential for control of soft rot disease caused by d. zeae in hyacinth bulb production.
