TI  == unraveling the hydroxypropionaldehyde (hpa) system: an active antimicrobial agent against human pathogens.
AB  == the hydroxypropionaldehyde (hpa) system is a natural defense system synthesized by the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus reuteri. to elucidate which of the molecules composing the hpa system (3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-hpa), reuterin (hpa dimer), and hpa hydrate) is responsible for the potent antimicrobial activity in biological systems, a combination of biochemical, genetic, and proteomic assays was used. the hpa system reacts with sulfhydryl-containing compounds such as cysteine and reduced glutathione (gsh) in solution. in situ, gsh knock-out escherichia coli is significantly more susceptible to hpa-mediated  cell death than e. coli wild type; gsh supplementation protects either bacteria from hpa attack. proteomic analysis of hpa-treated bacteria ( haemophilus influenzae ) revealed induction of redox- and heat shock-related proteins. a new  antimicrobial mechanism of hpa is proposed, whereby the activity of hpa leads to  depletion of free sh- groups in gsh and proteins through the action of 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde, causing an imbalance of the cellular redox status, ultimately resulting in cell death.
