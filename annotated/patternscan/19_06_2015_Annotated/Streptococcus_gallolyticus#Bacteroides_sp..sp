TI  == molecular-phylogenetic characterization of the microbiota in ulcerated and non-ulcerated regions in the patients with crohn's disease.
AB  == background: the dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota has been established in crohn's disease (cd), but the molecular characterization of this dysbiosis in chinese subjects with cd remains unclear. this study aims to investigate the predominant bacterial composition of the faecal and mucosal-associated microbiota in chinese cd patients using culture-independent techniques. methods/principal findings: eighteen patients with cd and 9 healthy controls were included in this  study. the faeces and the intestinal mucosal tissues from the ulcerated and nonulcerated sites were subjected to bacterial community fingerprinting using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). the predominant bacterial composition in the faeces and mucosa was determined with dna sequencing and blast. we showed that the bacterial diversity in the faeces of cd patients was reduced compared with that in healthy controls (p<0.01). the faecal bacterial dysbiosis of the patients was characterized by an elevated abundance of gamma-proteobacteria (especially escherichia coli and shigella flexneri) and a reduced proportion of bacteroidetes and firmicutes. five bacterial species defined the microbiota imbalance of the ulcerated mucosa in cd, including an increase in escherichia coli, a decrease in faecalibacterium prausnitzii, lactobacillus coleohominis, bacteroides sp and streptococcus gallolyticus in the  bacterial community as compared with the nonulcerated (p<0.01). conclusions/significance: this is the first description of intestinal microbiota  dysbiosis in chinese cd patients. these results allow a better understanding of the faecal and mucosal microbiota in cd, showing a predominance of some opportunistic pathogenic bacteria and a decrease in beneficial bacterial species. the findings may provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of cd in chinese population.

TI  == [analysis of diversity of vaginal microbiota in healthy chinese women by using dna-fingerprinting].
AB  == objective: to analyze the diversity of healthy women's vaginal dominant flora in  different physiological states with pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), to establish the basis for the future study of lower genital tract infections, and to provide a theoretical basis for the development of vaginal probiotics adapted to chinese females. methods: women who underwent routine gynecologic examinations in peking university first hospital from october 2009 to january 2010 were enrolled, including 30 at reproductive age and 30 at post menopause age. vaginal samples were collected and then total bacterial dna was extracted. universal bacterial primers were used to amplify the v3 region of 16s  rdna gene. pcr products were analyzed by denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). featured bands on dgge were recovered, cloned and sequenced. alignment with known sequence was made by using blast on genbank to identify bacterial strains so as to analyze the diversity of healthy women's vaginal dominant flora  in different physiological states. results: (1) vaginal flora in healthy chinese  women at their reproductive age were relatively simple, lactobacillus were the dominant bacteria. common bacteria included: lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners,and lactobacillus gasseri. while l. iners were the dominant vaginal bacteria that could not be recognized by traditional method. (2) vaginal  bacteria in the women at post menopause age were more complex than in those at reproductive age. common bacteria included: lactobacillus iners, lactobacillus crispatus, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus gallolyticus, veillonella sp., streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus anginosus, prevotella sp., anaerococcus lactolyticus and bacteroides fragilis. conclusion: based on the dgge analysis, the most common vaginal bacteria in chinese healthy women at reproductive age are lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners,and lactobacillus gasseri. the most common vaginal bacteria in healthy post-menopausal women are lactobacillus iners, lactobacillus crispatus, escherichia coli, streptococcus sp., prevotella sp.,bacteroides fragilis and lactic acid producing veillonella sp. and anaerococcus lactolyticus. meanwhile lactobacillus iners was firstly found by dgge to be the dominant vaginal bacteria in different physiological states.
