TI  == [the role of small bowel microflora in the development of secondary lactase deficiency and the possibilities of its treatment with probiotics].
AB  == aim: to estimate the incidence of secondary lactase deficiency (sld) in patients  with postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome (pibs) and the value of the small bowel microflora in its development and to elaborate treatment options for sld. subjects and methods: one hundred and thirty-eight patients with pibs, including  112 (81.2%) women and 26 (18.8%) men, were examined. the patients' mean age was 33.9 +/- 9.1 years. the duration of the disease was 2.6 +/- 1.4 years. lactase deficiency (ld) was diagnosed using the color scale to test biopsy specimens from the duodenal retrobulbar region. the bacterial overgrowth syndrome (bos) was identified by a 2-hour lactulose (20 ml) hydrogen breath test. sixty patients with moderate sld were randomized to 2 groups: 1) 41 patients received basic therapy (mesim forte as one tablet t.i.d., no-spa, 40 mg, t.i.d.) and combined probiotic bifiform (ferrosan) containing bifidobacterium longum 107, enterococcus faecium 107 as one capsule t.i.d. for 14 days. group 2 patients (n = 19) had basic therapy in combination with placebo. results: sld was detected in 59.4% of  the patients with pibs, including 43.5 and 15.9% with moderate and severe forms,  respectively. in all cases, sld was accompanied by bos in the small bowel lumen,  as confirmed by the results of a hydrogen breath test [101 +/- 37 ppm (a normal value of < 20 ppm)]. after a 14-day course of therapy with the combined probiotic bifiform, restoration of eubiosis in the small bowel lumen was achieved in 70.8%  of the patients, as shown by the lesser degree of bos (86.9 +/- 40.9 and 17.4 +/- 6.6 ppm before and after treatment, respectively; p < 0.01) and by normalization  of the lactase test (p < 0.01). in the comparative placebo group, 68.4% showed no clear positive changes, sld and bos remained. conclusion: the changes in the small bowel intraluminal microflora, which developed after prior intestinal infection, played a great role in the development of sld. bifiform belongs to the currently available probiotics and may be recommended to correct sld in patients  with pibs resulting from the impaired microbiota of the small bowel and to prevent bos.

TI  == effects of antibiotics on bacterial species composition and metabolic activities  in chemostats containing defined populations of human gut microorganisms.
AB  == the composition and metabolic activities of the human colonic microbiota are modulated by a number of external factors, including diet and antibiotic therapy. changes in the structure and metabolism of the gut microbiota may have long-term  consequences for host health. the large intestine harbors a complex microbial ecosystem comprising several hundreds of different bacterial species, which complicates investigations on intestinal physiology and ecology. to facilitate such studies, a highly simplified microbiota consisting of 14 anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic organisms (bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, clostridium butyricum, c. perfringens, c. bifermentans, c. innocuum, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus) was used in this investigation. ampicillin [9.2 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to two chemostats  operated at different dilution rates (d; 0.10 h(-1) and 0.21 h(-1)), and metronidazole [76.9 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to a third vessel (d = 0.21 h(-1)). perturbations in bacterial physiology and metabolism were sampled over a  48-h period. lactobacillus acidophilus and c. bifermentans populations did not establish in the fermentors under the imposed growth conditions. ampicillin resulted in substantial reductions in bacteroides and c. perfringens populations  at both dilution rates. metronidazole strongly affected bacteroides communities but had no effect on bifidobacterial communities. the bacteriostatic effect of ampicillin on bifidobacterial species was growth rate dependent. several metabolic activities were affected by antibiotic addition, including fermentation product formation and enzyme synthesis. the growth of antibiotic-resistant bifidobacteria in the large bowel may enable them to occupy ecological niches left vacant after antibiotic administration, preventing colonization by pathogenic species.

TI  == [lactase deficiency in patients with postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome and  the role of intestinal microflora in its development].
AB  == purpose: to define the frequency of secondary lactase deficiency (sld) in patients with postinfectious ibs and to develop therapy for the correction of mild sld in adult patients. methods and materials: in this study, 138 patients (the mean age - 33.9 +/- 9.09; f/m - 112/26) with postinfectious ibs were analyzed concerning lactase deficiency. all patients underwent intestinal endoscopy with biopsies from the mucosa of the descending duodenum in order to determine lactase deficiency twice before and after therapy. to diagnose small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (sibo) all patients underwent lactulose breath test during 2 hours. results: sld was detected in 59.4% of patients with postinfectious ibs. mild sld was determined in 43.5% of patients, and severe sld  - in 15.9% of patients. sld in all cases was accompanied by sibo (the mean level  of lactulose breath test was 101 +/- 37 ppm, n<20 ppm). in group patients who took the probiotic during 14 days in 70.8% of patients recovering of lactose metabolism in the small intestine and decreasing of the intensity of clinical symptoms were registered. the decrease of the lactulose breath test level (86.9 +/- 40.9 ppm; 17.4 +/- 6.6 ppm; p<0.01) and negative lqt (p<0.01) were registered in the first group. in group patients who took placebo during 14 days there was no positive effect in 68.4% of cases. conclusion: the probiotic bifiform, composed of bifidobacterium longum 10(7) and enterococcus faecium 10(7), demonstrated efficiency in correction of mild sld in patients with postinfectious ibs and can be used to prevent sibo.

TI  == a probiotics-containing biscuit modulates the intestinal microbiota in the elderly.
AB  == objectives: evaluation of the impact of a biscuit containing the probiotics bifidobacterium longum bar33 and lactobacillus helveticus bar13 on the intestinal microbiota in the elderly. design: randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. participants: thirty-two elderly volunteers living in italy. the group was composed of 19 women and 13 men aged between 71 and 88 years (mean 76). intervention: subjects were randomized in two groups consuming one dose of the probiotics-containing biscuit or placebo once a day for 30 days. measurements: for each subject the intestinal microbiota was characterized using the phylogenetic microarray platform htf-microbi.array before and after intervention. results: our data demonstrated that one-month consumption of a probiotics-containing biscuit was effective in redressing some of the age-related dysbioses of the intestinal microbiota. in particular, the probiotic treatment reverted the age-related increase of the opportunistic pathogens clostridium cluster xi, clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecium  and the enteropathogenic genus campylobacter. conclusion: the present study opens the way to the development of elderly-tailored probiotic-based functional foods to counteract the age-related dysbioses of the intestinal microbiota.

TI  == the effect of a multispecies synbiotic mixture on the duration of diarrhea and length of hospital stay in children with acute diarrhea in turkey: single blinded randomized study.
AB  == probiotics have been successfully used for the treatment of acute diarrhea in children and this effect depends on the strains and dose. the aim of this study was to assess the effect of a synbiotic mixture on the duration of diarrhea and the length of hospital stay in children with acute watery diarrhea. this is a prospective randomized, multicenter single blinded clinical trial in hospitalized children with acute watery diarrhea. all children were treated with conventional  hydration therapy with or without a daily dose of a synbiotic (2.5 x 10(9) cfu live bacteria including lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, enterococcus faecium, and 625 mg fructooligosaccharide) for 5 days. the primary endpoint was duration of diarrhea  and duration of hospitalization was the secondary endpoint. among 209 eligible children, 113 received the synbiotic mixture and 96 served as a control. the duration of diarrhea was significantly shorter ( approximately 36 h) in children  receiving the synbiotic group than the controls (77.9 +/- 30.5 vs. 114.6 +/- 37.4 h, p < 0.0001). the duration of hospitalization was shorter in children receiving the synbiotic group (4.94 +/- 1.7 vs. 5.77 +/- 1.97 days, p = 0.002). the effect  of synbiotic mixture on diarrhea started after 24th hours and stool frequency significantly decreased after 24th and 48th hours. the percentage of diarrhea-free children is significantly higher in synbiotic group at 48th and 72nd hours of synbiotic group. in conclusion, this study showed a reduction in diarrhea duration by approximately 36 h and a reduction in the duration of hospitalization with approximately 1 day in children with acute diarrhea with this synbiotic mixture.

TI  == the effect of using different probiotic cultures on conjugated linoleic acid (cla) concentration and fatty acid composition of white pickle cheese.
AB  == pickle white cheeses were produced from whole milk with five different probiotic  cultures (enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus paracasei, bifidobacterium longum,  bifidobacterium bifidum and lactobacillus acidophilus). conjugated linoleic acid  (cla) content of cheeses ranged from 3.52 to 3.92 mg/g. probiotic differences and storage process have not affected the cla contents of the samples statistically.  there was no correlation between the cla content of all probiotic cheeses and saturated fatty acids. a positive correlation between the cla and linoleic acid contents of l. paracasei and l. acidophilus cheeses was observed.

TI  == detection of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (bb12) in the intestine after feeding of sows and their piglets.
AB  == a real-time pcr method has been developed to distinguish bifidobacterium animalis subspecies in the gastrointestinal tracts of pigs. identification of a highly conserved single-copy tuf gene encoding the elongation factor tu involved in bacterial protein biosynthesis was used as a marker to differentiate homologous bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (strain bb12) from bifidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis, as well as bifidobacterium suis, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, several species of lactobacillus, and enterococcus faecium. real-time pcr detection of serially diluted dna extracted from a pure culture of bb12 was linear for bacterial numbers ranging from 10 to 10,000 tuf gene copies per pcr (r(2) = 0.99). relative differences in bb12 bacterial numbers in pigs fed daily with bb12 were determined after detection of bb12 tuf gene copies in dna extracted from the intestinal contents. piglets treated with bb12 immediately after birth maintained a high level of bb12 in their large intestines with continuous daily administration of bb12. piglets born to bb12-treated sows during the last third of their gestation and also treated with bb12 at birth (t/t group) had a higher number of bb12 organisms per gram of intestinal contents compared to placebo-treated piglets born to placebo-treated sows (c/c group), bb12-treated sows (t/c group), or piglets born to placebo sows but treated with bb12 immediately after birth (c/t group). in addition, there was a significant increase in gene expression for toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9) in piglets from the t/t group, with no change in tlr2 and tlr4. these findings suggest that the tuf gene represents a specific and functional marker for detecting bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis strain bb12 within the microbiota of the intestine.

TI  == are probiotics detectable in human feces after oral uptake by healthy volunteers?
AB  == goals: assessment of the presence of probiotic bacteria in feces after oral ingestion. background: probiotic bacteria are said to have beneficial effects on  the host. as a precondition for any effect, probiotic strains must survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract. study: the feces of seven volunteers  were analyzed for the presence of probiotic strains after one week's oral ingestion of each of six commercially available products: e. coli nissle 0.5-5 x  10(9) cells (mutaflor), enterococcus faecium sf 68 7.5 x 10(7) cells (bioflorin), lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium infantis both 1 x 10(9) cells (infloran), lactobacillus gasseri and bifidobacterium longum both 1 x 10(8) cells (omniflora), lactobacillus casei rhamnosus 1 x 10(9) cells (antibiophilus), and yoghurt enriched with lactobacillus casei immunitas 1 x 10(10) cells (actimel). ten colonies were selected from each stool sample, and dna was extracted and typed using random amplification of polymorphic dna (rapd). typing patterns of the ingested probiotics and the fecal isolates were compared. results: fingerprints identical to the ingested probiotic strains were recovered from fecal samples of 4/7 volunteers after one week of mutaflor, from 4/6 after taking bioflorin, and from 1/6 after infloran. cultivation of strains of the same species from fecal specimens was negative after consumption of antibiophilus, omniflora and actimel. conclusions: after oral consumption of probiotics, e. coli and enterococci could be detected in stool samples (57% and 67%, respectively). in contrast, with only one exception, ingested lactobacilli and bifidobacteria could not be detected in human feces.

TI  == therapeutic value of a lactobacillus gasseri and bifidobacterium longum fixed bacterium combination in acute diarrhea: a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial.
AB  == a multicenter, parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trial, involving 169 outpatients at 9 centers, was conducted to assess the efficacy of a fixed bacterium combination of lactobacillus gasseri and bifidobacterium longum in the therapy of acute diarrhea. in particular, this clinical trial was designed to prove equivalent therapeutic efficacy of a fixed bacterium combination versus an exhaustive investigated mono-bacterium medicinal  product. all patients, free to carry on usual daily activities, received 1 capsule 3 times a day of either a fixed bacterium combination of lactobacillus gasseri and bifidobacterium longum or enterococcus faecium mono-bacterium. all treatments were continued for a maximum of 6 days in line with the normal course  of acute diarrhea. primary efficacy criterion was the severity and duration of diarrhea assessed by the ensemble of stool frequency as change from baseline and  stool consistency at trial day 2, 3 and 4, and time in days until normal bowel function (recovery). the median duration of diarrhea was 2.70 days versus 2.67 days (fixed bacterium combination of lactobacillus gasseri and bifidobacterium longum versus mono-bacterium enterococcus feacium). the total mean difference of  duration of diarrhea was 0.072 days. this result can be considered equivalent. however, the proportion of patients with complete recovery tended to be higher in the fixed bacterium combination group (92.6% versus 87.1%) resulting in a number  needed to treat (nnt) of 18.1. the fixed bacterium combination reduced the number of unformed stools by 80% and the mono-bacterium by 75% during the first 2 days of treatment. both treatments were well tolerated. oral therapy with a fixed combination of lactobacillus gasseri and bifidobacterium longum shortens the duration and decreases the severity of acute self-limiting diarrhea in adults comparable to an effective mono-bacterium medicinal product. it therefore appears to be a useful and safe treatment for this disease.

TI  == production of interleukin (il)-10 and il-12 by murine colonic dendritic cells in  response to microbial stimuli.
AB  == intestinal dendritic cells (dc) are likely to regulate immunity to gut microflora, but little is known about their responses to bacterial antigens. therefore, dc from normal murine colon were characterized and their cytokine responses to components of gram-negative and/or gram-positive bacteria assessed.  cells were obtained by digestion of colonic tissue and contained dc that were identified by flow cytometry as cd11c(+) major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class ii(+) cells. purified dc were obtained by immunomagnetic separation plus cell sorting. dc had the morphology of immature myeloid cells, were endocytically active, expressed low levels of co-stimulatory molecules and stimulated a weak allogeneic mixed leucocyte reaction. analysis of flow cytometry data by a sensitive subtraction method allowed measurement of production of interleukin (il)-12 and il-10 by small numbers of gut dc by intracellular staining. fewer than 5% of unstimulated dc produced either il-10 or il-12. il-10 production was significantly up-regulated following stimulation with bifidobacteria longum, but  not after exposure to lipopolysaccharide (lps) or streptococcus faecium. in contrast, colonic dc produced il-12 in response to both lps and b.longum. thus, colonic dc can produce both il-12 and il-10 following bacterial stimulation. cell wall components from different bacteria stimulate distinct responses and may direct immune responses differentially in the gut.

TI  == development of a membrane-array method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == a membrane-array method was developed for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples without using the expensive microarray-arrayer and laser-scanner. the 16s rdna sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to nitrocellulose membranes. digoxigenin (dig)-labeled 16s rdnas were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from human fecal samples or pure cultured bacteria using two universal primers, and were hybridized to the membrane-array. hybridization signals were read by nbt/bcip color development. the 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, b. fragilis, b. distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, c. leptum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, ruminococcus obeum, r. bromii, r. callidus, r. albus, bifidobacterium  longum, b. adolescentis, b. infantis, eubacterium biforme, e. aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus,escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecium. the two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16s rdna from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. the hybridization results indicated that the membrane-array method is a reliable technique for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples. the result was also confirmed by  using specific pcr methods for these bacteria.

TI  == probiotics in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
AB  == antibiotic-associated diarrhoea is a common event. in some cases, it could represent a life-threatening event. clostridium difficile colitis is a further distinct complication of antibiotic administration. treatment options for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and clostridium difficile colitis include supplementation with several types of probiotics, as overviewed in this paper. three randomised, double-blind, controlled clinical trials show a therapeutic effect of saccharomyces boulardii in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. the efficacy of lactobacillus acidophilus and bulgaricus has also been ascertained in two double-blind controlled studies. other studies focusing on lactobacillus as a new preventive agent for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea are not double-blind. among these, a positive effect of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, bifidobacterium longum and enterococcus faecium sf68 has been reported. effectiveness of probiotics in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea has, therefore, a consistent scientific rationale, however few studies have performed an assessment of bacterial recovery in stools, and this approach may be helpful in deciding a more rigorous dose standardisation.

TI  == probiotics: "living drugs".
AB  == the uses, mechanisms of action, and safety of probiotics are discussed. probiotics are live microorganisms or microbial mixtures administered to improve  the patient's microbial balance, particularly the environment of the gastrointestinal tract and the vagina. the yeast saccharomyces boulardii and the  bacterium lactobacillus rhamnosus, strain gg, have shown efficacy in clinical trials for the prevention of antimicrobial-associated diarrhea. other probiotics  that have demonstrated at least some promise as prophylaxis for this type of diarrhea are lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium longum, and enterococcus  faecium. the use of s. boulardii as an adjunctive treatment to therapy with metronidazole or vancomycin has been found in controlled studies to decrease further recurrences of clostridium difficile-associated disease. other gastrointestinal disorders for which probiotics have been studied include traveler's diarrhea, acute infantile diarrhea, and acute diarrhea in adults. several lactobacillus species given in yogurt or in tablet or suppository form have shown clinical efficacy as a treatment for vaginal infections. lactobacillus strains have also been examined as a treatment for urinary-tract infections. putative mechanisms of action of probiotics include production of pathogen-inhibitory substances, inhibition of pathogen attachment, inhibition of  the action of microbial toxins, stimulation of immunoglobulin a, and trophic effects on intestinal mucosa. the available probiotics are considered nonpathogenic, but even benign microorganisms can be infective when a patient is  severely debilitated or immunosuppressed. probiotics have demonstrated an ability to prevent and treat some infections. effective use of probiotics could decrease  patients' exposure to antimicrobials. additional controlled studies are needed to clearly define the safety and efficacy of these agents.

TI  == treatment and prevention of antibiotic associated diarrhea.
AB  == mild or severe episodes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (aad) are common side effects of antibiotic therapy. the incidence of aad differs with the antibiotic and varies from 5 to 25%. the major form of intestinal disorders is the pseudomembranous colitis associated with clostridium difficile which occurs in 10-20% of all aad. in most cases of aad discontinuation or replacement of the inciting antibiotic by another drug with lower aad risk can be effective. for more severe cases involving c. difficile, the treatment of diarrhea requires an antibiotic treatment, with glycopeptides (vancomycin) or metronidazole. another approach to aad treatment or prevention is based on the use of non-pathogenic living organisms, capable of re-establishing the equilibrium of the intestinal ecosystem. several organisms have been used in treatment or prophylaxis of aad such as selected strains of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium longum, and enterococcus faecium. another biotherapeutic agent, a non-pathogenic yeast, saccharomyces boulardii has been used. in animal models of  c. difficile colitis initiated by clindamycin, animals treated with s. boulardii  (at end of vancomycin therapy) had a significant decrease in c. difficile colony-forming units, and of toxin b production. in several clinical randomised trials (versus placebo), s. boulardii has demonstrated its effectiveness by decreasing significantly the occurrence of c. difficile colitis and preventing the pathogenic effects of toxins a and b of c. difficile. it has been shown to be a safe and effective therapy in relapses of c. difficile colitis. a good response has been seen in children with aad, treated by s. boulardii only. in icus prevention of aad remains based on limitation of antibiotic overuse and spread of c. difficile or other agents of aad should be prevented by improved hygiene measures (single rooms, private bathrooms for patients, use of gloves and hand washing for personnel). in addition the increasing use of biotherapeutic agents such as s. boulardii should permit the prevention of the major side effect of antibiotics, i.e. aad in at risk patients.

TI  == growth of a human intestinal desulfovibrio desulfuricans in continuous cultures containing defined populations of saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting bacteria.
AB  == ecological and physiological effects of the sulphate-reducing bacterium (srb) desulfovibrio desulfuricans on other intestinal organisms were investigated in anaerobic chemostats (dilution rate approximately 0.2 h-1). reproducible defined  bacterial communities were used in these experiments, comprising 14 different saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting species: bifidobacterium longum, bif. adolescentis, bif. pseudolongum, bif. infantis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bact. vulgatus, lactobacillus acidophilus, enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium, escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, cl. butyricum, cl. innocuum, cl. bifermentans. lactobacillus and cl. bifermentans populations never rose above minimum detection limits (log10 2.0 and 4.0, respectively) under the experimental conditions employed in these studies. inclusion of des. desulfuricans in bacterial cultures (c. log10 8.4 viable cells ml-1) resulted in marked reductions (i.e. greater than 1 log) in planktonic cell population densities of several species, particularly bif. longum, cl. perfringens and bif. pseudolongum. the two bacteroides species were unaffected by des. desulfuricans, while numbers of cl. butyricum increased. extensive wall growth developed in the srb culture, consisting mainly of des. desulfuricans (log10 9.2 viable cells ml-1), bact. thetaiotaomicron and bact. vulgatus, with lesser numbers of facultative anaerobes, cl. perfringens and bif. longum. wall growth was associated with a reduction in planktonic cell mass and increased acid production by the cultures.  chemotaxonomic study of chemostat microbiotas, on the basis of cellular fatty acid methyl ester (fame) analyses, showed the existence of characteristic bacteroides (c15) and bifidobacterial (c18) markers, but desulfovibrio markers (i-c15:0, c16:0, i-c17:1) could be identified. the metabolic activities of saccharolytic organisms were altered in the srb chemostat, including synthesis of a number of hydrolytic enzymes involved in carbohydrate breakdown, such as alpha-galactosidase, alpha-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase, together with several mucinolytic enzymes. high concentrations of sulphide (8.2 mmol 1-1) were  detected in the srb chemostat, suggesting that this metabolite may have been inhibitory to some species. saccharolytic organisms growing in the srb fermenter  utilized more starch, but less galactose-containing polymers, which correlated with the observed glycosidase activities. profound differences were also recorded with respect to fermentation product formation in the chemostats, where a major switch to acetate production occurred in the srb culture, with concomitant reductions in propionate, butyrate and lactate, which is an important electron donor for desulfovibrios.

TI  == taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the current taxonomy of probiotic lactic acid bacteria is reviewed with special focus on the genera lactobacillus, bifidobacterium and enterococcus. the physiology and taxonomic position of species and strains of these genera were investigated by phenotypic and genomic methods. in total, 176 strains, including  the type strains, have been included. phenotypic methods applied were based on biochemical, enzymatical and physiological characteristics, including growth temperatures, cell wall analysis and analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic  proteins. genomic methods used were pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge), randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and dna-dna hybridization for bifidobacteria. in the genus lactobacillus the following species of importance as probiotics were investigated: l. acidophilus group, l. casei group and l. reuteri/l. fermentum group. most strains referred to as l. acidophilus in probiotic products could be identified either as l. gasseri or as l. johnsonii, both members of the l. acidophilus group. a similar situation could be shown in the l. casei group, where most of the strains named l. casei belonged to l. paracasei subspp. a recent proposal to reject the species l. paracasei and to include this species in the restored species l. casei with a neotype strain was supported by protein analysis. bifidobacterium spp. strains have been reported to be used for production of fermented dairy and recently of probiotic products. according to phenotypic features and confirmed by dna-dna hybridization most of the bifidobacteria strains from dairy origin belonged to b. animalis, although they were often declared as b. longum by the manufacturer. from the genus enterococcus, probiotic ec. faecium strains were investigated with regard to the  vana-mediated resistance against glycopeptides. these unwanted resistances could  be ruled out by analysis of the 39 kda resistance protein. in conclusion, the taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria can only be understood  by using polyphasic taxonomy combining morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics with molecular-based phenotypic and genomic techniques.

TI  == biotherapeutic agents. a neglected modality for the treatment and prevention of selected intestinal and vaginal infections.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the potential of biotherapeutic agents (microorganisms with therapeutic properties) for the prevention and/or treatment of selected intestinal and vaginal infections. data sources: the medline database was searched for all relevant articles published between 1966 and september 1995. search terms used were biotherapeutic agent, probiotic, lactobacillus, saccharomyces, bifidobacterium, candida, gastrointestinal- system, vaginitis, vaginosis-bacterial, and related terms. the bibliographies of obtained articles were also reviewed. study selection and data extraction: all placebo-controlled human studies on biotherapeutic agents were reviewed. english-language open trials, case series and reports, and animal studies were reviewed only if they were especially relevant to providing information on the potential efficacy, adverse effects, or mechanisms of action of these agents. data synthesis: placebo-controlled studies have shown that biotherapeutic agents have been used successfully to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea (lactobacillus caseigg, bifidobacterium longum, b longum with l acidophilus, and saccharomyces boulardii), to prevent acute infantile diarrhea (bifidobacterium bifidum with streptococcus thermophilus), to treat recurrent clostridium difficile disease (s  boulardii), and to treat various other diarrheal illnesses (enterococcus faecium  sf68, l caseigg, and s boulardii). there is also evidence for lactobacillus acidophilus in the prevention of candidal vaginitis. few adverse effects have been reported. however, many of the studies tested only small numbers of patients or volunteers. conclusions: there is now evidence that administration of selected microorganisms is beneficial in the prevention and treatment of certain intestinal and, possibly, treatment of vaginal infections. in an effort to decrease the reliance on antimicrobials, the time has come to carefully explore the therapeutic applications of biotherapeutic agents.

AB  == a double-blind placebo controlled investigation was carried out to study the effect of peroral colonization. human volunteers were given mixtures of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria. measurements were made over a 1 week treatment period and for another week after the end of the treatment. two different bacteriological preparations were used, one consisted of enterococcus faecium and bifidobacterium longum (a total of 6.4 x 10(8) cfu d-1); the other consisted of lactobacillus acidophilus, bif. bifidum, lact. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus (a total of 9 x 10(9) cfu d-1). together with a placebo preparation, they were given to 24 healthy controls (eight in each group). microbiological examinations of jejunal aspirates showed that viable counts of most species were below the detection limit. however, the test preparation containing ent. faecium and bif. longum significantly reduced the anaerobe: aerobe ratio in faeces by a factor of three during treatment (p = 0.03), and increased it by a factor of 30 during the following week (p < 0.02). this study shows that peroral administration of certain bacterial cultures may affect the distal intestinal microflora.
