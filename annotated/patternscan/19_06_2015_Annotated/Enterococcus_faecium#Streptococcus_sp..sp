TI  == telavancin activity tested against gram-positive clinical isolates from european, russian and israeli hospitals (2011-2013) using a revised broth microdilution testing method: redefining the baseline activity of telavancin.
AB  == objectives: to reassess the activity of telavancin when tested against gram-positive clinical pathogens recovered from hospitalized patients in european and adjacent regions using a revised broth microdilution method. methods: 11 601  consecutive, non-duplicate isolates originating from 36 institutions among 18 countries recovered between 2011 and 2013 were tested for susceptibility using a  revised broth microdilution method for telavancin. interpretive telavancin breakpoints appropriate for the method were those recently approved by the fda and eucast, as available. results: telavancin (mic50/90, 0.03/0.06 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) was equally potent against methicillin-susceptible ((mssa) and methicillin-resistant (mrsa) staphylococcus aureus. all enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to telavancin (mic50/90, 0.12/0.12 mg/l) and inhibited at the susceptibility breakpoint (i.e. </= 0.25 mg/l), except for vana-phenotype vancomycin-resistant isolates (telavancin mic, >1 mg/l). telavancin ( </= 0.015/0.03 mg/l) was active against vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium,  while higher mic values were obtained for vana strains. telavancin (both mic50 and mic90, </= 0.015 mg/l) was potent against streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-haemolytic streptococci (mic50/90, </= 0.015/0.06 mg/l) and viridans group streptococci (mic50/90, </= 0.015/0.03 mg/l). conclusions: telavancin exhibited potent activity against this contemporary (2011-2013) collection of organisms, inhibiting indicated pathogens at or below the fda/eucast-approved breakpoints for susceptibility. vana-phenotype enterococci were less susceptible to telavancin, a feature observed using the previous testing method. these results redefine telavancin's activity against isolates from europe.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance profile of enterococcus species isolated from intestinal tracts of hospitalized patients in jimma, ethiopia.
AB  == background: multi-drug-resistant enterococci colonizing the intestinal tract of hospitalized patients are the major source of infection as well as nosocomial spread. despite worldwide increasing rate of multidrug resistant enterococci colonization and infection among hospitalized patients, there is scarcity of data from resource limited setting. the present study aimed at determining the antimicrobial resistance profile of enterococcus species from intestinal tracts of hospitalized patients in jimma, ethiopia. methods: the study was conducted among hospitalized patients at jimma university specialized hospital, from january to july 2013. fecal samples were collected and processed for bacterial isolation and susceptibility testing to antimicrobial agents. stool samples were  inoculated onto enterococcus selective media (bile esculin azide agar plate) with and without 6 microg/ml of vancomycin. the isolates were identified to genus and  species level by cultural characteristics, gram's stain, catalase test, growth in 6.5% nacl broth, growth at 45 degrees c, motility test and by using api 20 streptococcus system. sensitivity testing was done using kirby-bauer disk diffusion method. minimum inhibitory concentrations for vancomycin were determined using e-test strips. result: overall, enterococci were isolated from 114 (76%) of the study subjects. the isolates were enterococcus faecium (35.1%) followed by enterococcus faecalis (29.8%), enterococcus gallinarum (17.5%), enterococcus casseliflavus (8.8%) and enterococcus durans (8.8%). among 114 tested enterococci isolates, 41 (36%) were resistant to ampicillin, 62 (54.4%) to streptomycin and 39 (34.2%) to gentamycin. other alternative antibiotics to treat mixed nosocomial infection caused by enterococci also showed high rate of resistance in vitro: ciprofloxacin (50% of resistance), norfloxacin (49.1%), erythromycin (63.2%), tetracycline (64.9%), chloramphenicol (34.2%), and nitrofrantoin (32.4%). multiple drug resistance was observed among 89.5% of e. faecium and e. faecalis. vancomycin resistant enterococci were observed in 5% of  e. faecium isolates. conclusion: this study reveals high rate of fecal colonization by multidrug-resistant enterococci and prevalence of vancomycin resistance strains. thus periodic surveillance of antibacterial susceptibilities  is recommended to detect emerging resistance and to prevent the spread of antibacterial-resistant strains.

TI  == evaluation of regional antibiograms to monitor antimicrobial resistance in hampton roads, virginia.
AB  == we studied recent antibiograms (2010 to 2011) from 12 hospitals in the hampton roads area, virginia, that refer patients to a tertiary-care facility affiliated  with eastern virginia medical school. the data was compiled into a regional antibiogram, and sensitivity rates of common isolates from the tertiary-care facility (central) were compared to those of referring hospitals grouped by locale. staphylococcus aureus was the most common gram- positive and e. coli the  most common gram- negative organism grown from clinical samples in the area. overall 53% of s.aureus isolates were resistant to oxacillin. there was a broad scatter of mic (minimum inhibitory concentration) for vancomycin within the susceptibility range, and mic of 4 mug/ml was reported in 2012. penicillin resistance was seen in 50% and erythromycin resistance in 45% of streptococcus pneumoniae. vancomycin resistance was seen in 75% of enterococcus faecium and 2%  of enterococcus faecalis respectively. acinetobacter baumannii was the most resistant gram negative organism in the data compiled. among the escherichia coli, 26%, 44% and 52%were resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole ( sxt) ampicillin- sulbactam and ampicillin respectively. we found significant differences in methodology, interpretation and antibiotic panels used by area laboratories. based on these findings, we are now prospectively following resistance patterns in the tertiary-care facility, sharing data, and creating a consistent approach to antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the region.

TI  == utilization of blood cultures in danish hospitals: a population-based descriptive analysis.
AB  == this national population-based study was conducted as part of the development of  a national automated surveillance system for hospital-acquired bacteraemia and ascertains the utilization of blood cultures (bcs). a primary objective was to understand how local differences may affect interpretation of nationwide surveillance for bacteraemia. from the danish microbiology database, we retrieved all bcs taken between 2010 and 2013 and linked these to admission data from the national patient registry. in total, 4 587 295 admissions were registered, and in 11%, at least one bc was taken. almost 50% of bcs were taken at admission. the chance of having a bc taken declined over the next days but increased after 4 days of admission. data linkage identified 876 290 days on which at least one bc  was taken; 6.4% yielded positive results. ten species, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella oxytoca, accounted for 74.7% of agents for this purpose classified as pathogenic. an increase in bcs and positive bcs was observed over time, particularly among older patients. bcs showed a seasonal pattern overall and for s. pneumoniae particularly. a predominance of male patients was seen for bacteraemias due to s. aureus, e. faecium and k. pneumoniae. minor differences in bcs and positive bcs between departments of clinical microbiology underpin the rationale of a future automated surveillance for bacteraemia. the study also provides important knowledge for interpretation of surveillance of invasive infections more generally.

TI  == in vitro activity of linezolid as assessed through the 2013 leader surveillance program.
AB  == the 2013 leader surveillance program monitored the in vitro activity of linezolid and comparator agents against gram-positive bacteria at 60 medical centers in the united states. a total of 7183 pathogens were contributed from 6 predetermined pathogen groups. the groups were staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans group streptococci. the mic90 value for each of the 6  pathogen groups was 1 mug/ml. susceptibility of "all organisms" to linezolid was  99.83%. only 12 isolates (2 s. aureus, 3 staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 streptococcus sanguinis, 5 enterococcus faecium, and 1 enterococcus faecalis) were nonsusceptible to linezolid (0.17%). three of these (2 s. aureus and 1 e. faecium) harbored the cfr resistance mechanism. the findings indicate that linezolid activity remains stable, although there are examples of clonal dissemination within several monitored institutions.

TI  == endophytic fungi: a reservoir of antibacterials.
AB  == multidrug drug resistant bacteria are becoming increasingly problematic particularly in the under developed countries of the world. the most important microorganisms that have seen a geometric rise in numbers are methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecium, penicillin resistant streptococcus pneumonia and multiple drug resistant tubercule bacteria to name a just few. new drug scaffolds are essential to tackle this every increasing problem. these scaffolds can be sourced from nature itself. endophytic fungi are an important reservoir of therapeutically active compounds.  this review attempts to present some data relevant to the problem. new, very specific and effective antibiotics are needed but also at an affordable price! a  herculean task for researchers all over the world! in the asian subcontinent indigenous therapeutics that has been practiced over the centuries such as ayurveda have been effective as "handed down data" in family generations. may need a second, third and more "in-depth investigations?"

TI  == update of the telavancin activity in vitro tested against a worldwide collection  of gram-positive clinical isolates (2013), when applying the revised susceptibility testing method.
AB  == a revised broth microdilution susceptibility testing method for telavancin was approved by the food and drug administration (fda). telavancin activity was assessed against gram-positive pathogens collected worldwide (2013) using the revised method. a total of 12,346 isolates from 90 sites were included as part of the telavancin international surveillance program for the americas, europe, and asia-pacific. telavancin had mic50 and mic90 values of 0.03 and 0.06 mug/ml, respectively, against staphylococci, regardless of methicillin susceptibility, and inhibited all staphylococcus aureus at </=0.12 mug/ml (revised fda breakpoint). telavancin was 8-fold more active than daptomycin (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5 mug/ml) and 16- to 32-fold more active than vancomycin (mic50/90, 1/1 mug/ml) and linezolid (mic50/90, 1/1 mug/ml) against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. all 692 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis were inhibited by telavancin (mic50/90, 0.12/0.12 mug/ml) at </=0.25 mug/ml (fda breakpoint), except for 1 strain (mic, 0.5 mug/ml). all enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis with telavancin mic values of >/=0.5 and >/=1 mug/ml, respectively, had a vana phenotype. a comparison data analysis based on the mic90 demonstrated that telavancin was at least 8-fold more potent than comparators against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci. streptococci showed telavancin mic50 values of </=0.015 mug/ml, except for streptococcus agalactiae (mic50, 0.03 mug/ml). these in vitro results obtained by the recently approved susceptibility testing method establish a new benchmark of telavancin activity worldwide.

TI  == antibiotic resistance prevalence in routine bloodstream isolates from children's  hospitals varies substantially from adult surveillance data in europe.
AB  == background: surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (amr) is central for defining appropriate strategies to deal with changing amr levels. it is unclear whether childhood amr patterns differ from those detected in isolates from adult  patients. methods: resistance percentages of nonduplicate staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa bloodstream isolates from children less than 18 years of age reported to the antibiotic resistance and prescribing in european children (arpec) project were compared with all-age resistance percentages reported by the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance network (ears-net) for the same pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, period and countries. in addition, resistance percentages were compared between arpec isolates from children less than 1 year of age and children greater than or equal to1 year of age. results: resistance percentages for many important pathogen-antibiotic class combinations were different for arpec isolates compared with ears-net. e. coli and k. pneumoniae fluoroquinolone  resistance percentages were substantially lower in arpec (13.4% and 17.9%) than in ears-net (23.0% and 30.7%), whereas the reverse was true for all pathogen-antibiotic class combinations in p. aeruginosa (for example, 27.3% aminoglycoside resistance in arpec, 19.3% in ears-net, 32.8% carbapenem resistance in arpec and 20.5% in ears-net), and for s. pneumoniae and macrolide resistance. for many gram-negative pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, isolates from children greater than or equal to 1 year of age showed higher resistance percentages than isolates from children less than 1 year of age. conclusions: age-stratified presentation of resistance percentage estimates by surveillance programs will allow identification of important variations in resistance patterns between different patient groups for targeted intervention.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese.
AB  == the water buffalo mozzarella cheese is a typical italian cheese which has been introduced in the thriving brazilian market in the last 10 y, with good acceptance by its consumers. lactic acid bacteria (lab) play an important role in the technological and sensory quality of mozzarella cheese. in this study, the aim was to evaluate the diversity of the autochthones viable lab isolated from water buffalo mozzarella cheese under storage. samples were collected in 3 independent trials in a dairy industry located in the southeast region of brazil, on the 28th day of storage, at 4 masculinec. the lab were characterized by gram staining, catalase test, capacity to assimilate citrate, and production of co2 from glucose. the diversity of lab was evaluated by rapd-pcr (randomly amplified  polymorphic dna-polymerase chain reaction), 16s rrna gene sequencing, and by vitek 2 system. twenty lab strains were isolated and clustered into 12 different  clusters, and identified as streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and lactobacillus helveticus. enterococcus species were dominant and  citrate-positive. only the strains of l. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and l. fermentum produced co2 from glucose and were citrate-positive, while l. casei  was only citrate positive. this is the first report which elucidates the lab diversity involved in brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese. furthermore, the results show that despite the absence of natural whey cultures as starters in production, the lab species identified are the ones typically found in mozzarella cheese.

TI  == pyrosequencing vs. culture-dependent approaches to analyze lactic acid bacteria associated to chicha, a traditional maize-based fermented beverage from northwestern argentina.
AB  == the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) associated with chicha, a traditional maize-based fermented alcoholic beverage from northwestern argentina, was analyzed using culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches. samples corresponding to 10 production steps were obtained from two local producers at maimara (chicha m) and tumbaya (chicha t). whereas by culture-dependent approach  a few number of species (lactobacillus plantarum and weissella viridescens in chicha m, and enterococcus faecium and leuconostoc mesenteroides in chicha t) were identified, a higher quantitative distribution of taxa was found in both beverages by pyrosequencing. the relative abundance of otus was higher in chicha  m than in chicha t; six lab genera were common for chicha m and t: enterococcus,  lactococcus, streptococcus, weissella, leuconostoc and lactobacillus while pediococcus only was detected in chicha m. among the 46 identified lab species, those of lactobacillus were dominant in both chicha samples, exhibiting the highest diversity, whereas enterococcus and leuconostoc were recorded as the second dominant genera in chicha t and m, respectively. identification at species level showed the predominance of lb. plantarum, lactobacillus rossiae, leuconostoc lactis and w. viridescens in chicha m while enterococcus hirae, e. faecium, lc. mesenteroides and weissella confusa predominated in chicha t samples. in parallel, when presumptive lab isolates (chicha m: 146; chicha t: 246) recovered from the same samples were identified by isr-pcr and rapd-pcr profiles, species-specific pcr and 16s rrna gene sequencing, most of them were assigned to the leuconostoc genus (lc. mesenteroides and lc. lactis) in chicha m, lactobacillus, weissella and enterococcus being also present. in contrast, chicha t exhibited the presence of enterococcus and leuconostoc, e. faecium being the most representative species. massive sequencing approach was applied for the first time to study the diversity and evolution of microbial communities during chicha manufacture. although differences in the lab species profile between the two geographically different chicha productions were observed by culturing, a larger number for predominant lab species as well as other minorities were revealed by pyrosequencing. the fine molecular inventory achieved by pyrosequencing provided more precise information on lab population composition than culture-dependent analysis processes.

TI  == synthesis and structure-activity relationship of amidine derivatives of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene as novel antibacterial agents.
AB  == current antibacterial chemotherapeutics are facing an alarming increase in bacterial resistance pressuring the search for novel agents that would expand the available therapeutic arsenal against resistant bacterial pathogens. in line with these efforts, a series of 9 amidine derivatives of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene were synthesized and, together with 18 previously synthesized analogs, evaluated  for their relative dna binding affinity, in vitro antibacterial activities and preliminary in vitro safety profile. encouraging antibacterial activity of several subclasses of tested amidine derivatives against gram-positive (including resistant mrsa, mrse, vre strains) and gram-negative bacterial strains was observed. the bis-phenyl derivatives were the most antibacterially active, while  compound 19 from bis-benzimidazole class exhibited the widest spectrum of activity (with mic of 4, 2, 0.5 and </=0.25 mug/ml against laboratory strains of  staphyloccocus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, moraxella catarrhalis, respectively and 4-32 mug/ml against clinical isolates of  sensitive and resistant s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecium) and also demonstrated the strongest dna binding affinity (deltatm of 15.4 degrees c). asymmetrically designed compounds and carboxamide-amidines were, in general, less active. molecular docking indicated that the shape of the 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene derivatives and their ability to form multiple electrostatic and hydrogen bonds with dna, corresponds to the binding modes of other minor-groove binders. herein reported results encourage further investigation of this class of compounds as novel antibacterial dna binding agents.

TI  == blood infections in patients treated at transplantation wards of a clinical hospital in warsaw.
AB  == establishment of the etiology in blood infection is always advisable. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the proportion of different bacterial species, including aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in blood cultures of patients hospitalized in transplantation wards of a large clinical hospital between 2010 and 2012. a total of 1994 blood samples from patients who were treated at one of  two transplantation wards of a large hospital in warsaw were analyzed using an automated blood culture system, bact/alert (biomerieux, france). the 306 bacterial strains were obtained from the examined samples. the highest proportion were bacteria from the family enterobacteriaceae (112 strains; 36.6%) with escherichia coli (61 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (30 strains), and enterobacter cloacae (10 strains) most commonly isolated. the non-fermenting bacilli constituted 21.6% (66 strains), with most common stenotrophomonas maltophilia (31 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (14 strains), achromobacter spp. (12 strains), and acinetobacter baumannii (3 strains). most frequent gram-positive bacteria were staphylococci (25.2%). of 77 staphylococcal strains,  56 were coagulase-negative staphylococci and 21 staphylococcus aureus. other gram-positive bacteria included enterococci (14 strains) and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 strain). obligatory anaerobic bacteria were represented by 19 strains (6.2% of total isolates). among all enterobacteriaceae, 49 isolates (43.7%) produced extended-spectrum ss-lactamases (esbls). resistance to methicillin was detected in 62% of s aureus isolates and in 46% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. of 14 enterococci cultured from blood samples,  2 strains (14.3%) were resistant to vancomycin. both were enterococcus faecium. resistant strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria are significant problems for patients in the transplantation ward.

TI  == use of probiotics to reduce faecal shedding of shiga toxin-producing escherichia  coli in sheep.
AB  == shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) are zoonotic, foodborne pathogens of humans. ruminants, including sheep, are the primary reservoirs of stec and there is a need to develop intervention strategies to reduce the entry of stec into the food chain. the initiation of the majority of bacterial, enteric infections involves colonisation of the gut mucosal surface by the pathogen. however, probiotic bacteria can serve to decrease the severity of infection via a number of mechanisms including competition for receptors and nutrients, and/or the synthesis of organic acids and bacteriocins that create an environment unfavourable for pathogen development. the aim of the current study was to determine whether the administration of a probiotic mixture to sheep experimentally infected with a non-o157 stec strain, carrying stx1, stx2 and eae  genes, was able to decrease faecal shedding of the pathogen. the probiotic mixture contained lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus and enterococcus faecium. the numbers of non-o157 stec in faecal samples collected from sheep receiving daily doses of the probiotic mixture were significantly lower at the 3rd, 5th and 6th week post-inoculation when compared to the levels recorded in untreated animals. it was concluded that administration of the probiotic mixture reduced faecal shedding of non-o157 stec in sheep, and holds potential as a pre-harvest intervention method to reduce transmission to humans.

TI  == bacteriocin protein bacl1 of enterococcus faecalis targets cell division loci and specifically recognizes l-ala2-cross-bridged peptidoglycan.
AB  == bacteriocin 41 (bac41) is produced from clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis and consists of two extracellular proteins, bacl1 and baca. we previously reported that bacl1 protein (595 amino acids, 64.5 kda) is a bacteriolytic peptidoglycan d-isoglutamyl-l-lysine endopeptidase that induces cell lysis of e. faecalis when an accessory factor, baca, is copresent. however,  the target of bacl1 remains unknown. in this study, we investigated the targeting specificity of bacl1. fluorescence microscopy analysis using fluorescent dye-conjugated recombinant protein demonstrated that bacl1 specifically localized at the cell division-associated site, including the equatorial ring, division septum, and nascent cell wall, on the cell surface of target e. faecalis cells. this specific targeting was dependent on the triple repeat of the sh3 domain located in the region from amino acid 329 to 590 of bacl1. repression of cell growth due to the stationary state of the growth phase or to treatment with bacteriostatic antibiotics rescued bacteria from the bacteriolytic activity of bacl1 and baca. the static growth state also abolished the binding and targeting  of bacl1 to the cell division-associated site. furthermore, the targeting of bacl1 was detectable among gram-positive bacteria with an l-ala-l-ala-cross-bridging peptidoglycan, including e. faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, or streptococcus pneumoniae, but not among bacteria with alternate peptidoglycan structures, such as enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae, staphylococcus aureus, or listeria monocytogenes. these data suggest that bacl1 specifically targets the l-ala-l-ala-cross-bridged peptidoglycan and potentially  lyses the e. faecalis cells during cell division.

AB  == objectives: to assess oritavancin activity in vitro against clinically relevant gram-positive pathogens causing skin and soft-tissue infections (sstis) in european and us hospitals. methods: 13 262 consecutive and unique isolates deemed to be responsible for sstis were included. isolates originated from 36 and 27 institutions in europe (israel included) and the usa, respectively, between 2010  and 2013. results: oritavancin (98.8% susceptible) showed modal mic, mic50 and mic90 results of 0.03, 0.03 and 0.06 mg/l, respectively, for staphylococcus aureus. cons from the usa (mic50, 0.015 mg/l) demonstrated an mic50 value of oritavancin slightly lower than those from europe (mic50, 0.03 mg/l). overall, vancomycin-resistant (vana-phenotype) enterococcus faecalis had oritavancin mics  (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5 mg/l) that were 16-fold higher than those obtained for vancomycin-susceptible isolates (mic50/90, 0.015/0.03 mg/l; 99.2%-99.8% susceptible); nevertheless, oritavancin inhibited all vana e. faecalis at </=0.5  mg/l. equivalent oritavancin mics (mic50/90, 0.004/0.008 mg/l) were noted for all vanb and vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium, while higher mics (mic50/90, 0.03/0.12 mg/l) were obtained for vana strains. oritavancin had low mics against the overall populations of streptococcus pyogenes (mic50/90, 0.03/0.12 mg/l; 98.4%-98.6% susceptible), streptococcus agalactiae (mic50/90, 0.03/0.06 mg/l; 97.9%-98.0% susceptible) and the streptococcus anginosus group (mic50/90, 0.008/0.015 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible), with slightly higher mics for streptococcus dysgalactiae (mic50/90, 0.06/0.25 mg/l; >/=98.3% susceptible). conclusions: oritavancin had potent activity in vitro against this contemporary collection of european and us isolates causing sstis. these results describe oritavancin activity against gram-positive pathogens collected shortly prior to its regulatory approval in the usa.

TI  == baseline activity of telavancin against gram-positive clinical isolates responsible for documented infections in u.s. hospitals (2011-2012) as determined by the revised susceptibility testing method.
AB  == telavancin had mic50 and mic90 values of 0.03 and 0.06 mug/ml (100.0% susceptible), respectively, against methicillin-resistant and -susceptible staphylococcus aureus. telavancin was active against vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis (mic50/90, 0.12/0.12 mug/ml; 100% susceptible) and enterococcus faecium (mic50/90, 0.03/0.06 mug/ml), while higher mic values were obtained against vancomycin-resistant e. faecium (mic50/90, 1/2 mug/ml) and e. faecalis (mic50/90, >2/>2 mug/ml). streptococci showed telavancin modal mic results of </= 0.015 mug/ml, except against streptococcus agalactiae (i.e., 0.03  mug/ml). this study reestablishes the telavancin spectrum of activity against isolates recovered from the united states (2011-2012) using the revised broth microdilution method.

TI  == in vitro fermentation of lactulose by human gut bacteria.
AB  == lactulose has been known as a prebiotic that can selectively stimulate the growth of beneficial bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. recent studies have indicated that streptococcus mutans, clostridium perfringens, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii are also able to utilize lactulose. however, the previous studies mainly focused  on the utilization of lactulose by individual strains, and few studies were designed to identify the species that could utilize lactulose among gut microbiota. this study aimed to identify lactulose-metabolizing bacteria in the human gut, using in silico and traditional culture methods. the prediction results suggested that genes for the transporters and glycosidases of lactulose are well distributed in the genomes of 222 of 453 strains of gastrointestinal-tract bacteria. the screening assays identified 35 species with  the ability to utilize lactulose, of which cronobacter sakazakii, enterococcus faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas putida were reported for the first time to be capable of utilizing lactulose. in addition, significant correlations between lactulose and galactooligosaccharide metabolism were found.  thus, more attention should be paid to bacteria besides bifidobacteria and lactobacilli to further investigate the relationship between functional oligosaccharides and gut bacteria.

TI  == novel imidazoline antimicrobial scaffold that inhibits dna replication with activity against mycobacteria and drug resistant gram-positive cocci.
AB  == bacterial antimicrobial resistance is an escalating public health threat, yet the current antimicrobial pipeline remains alarmingly depleted, making the development of new antimicrobials an urgent need. here, we identify a novel, potent, imidazoline antimicrobial compound, ski-356313, with bactericidal activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis and gram-positive cocci, including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre) and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). ski-356313 is active in murine models of streptococcus pneumoniae and mrsa infection and is potently bactericidal for both replicating and nonreplicating m. tuberculosis. using a combination of genetics,  whole genome sequencing, and a novel target id approach using real time imaging of core macromolecular biosynthesis, we show that ski-356313 inhibits dna replication and displaces the replisome from the bacterial nucleoid. these results identify a new antimicrobial scaffold with a novel mechanism of action and potential therapeutic utility against nonreplicating m. tuberculosis and antibiotic resistant gram-positive cocci.

TI  == construction of a chimeric lysin ply187n-v12c with extended lytic activity against staphylococci and streptococci.
AB  == developing chimeric lysins with a wide lytic spectrum would be important for treating some infections caused by multiple pathogenic bacteria. in the present work, a novel chimeric lysin (ply187n-v12c) was constructed by fusing the catalytic domain (ply187n) of the bacteriophage lysin ply187 with the cell binding domain (146-314aa, v12c) of the lysin plyv12. the results showed that the chimeric lysin ply187n-v12c had not only lytic activity similar to ply187n against staphylococcal strains but also extended its lytic activity to streptococci and enterococci, such as streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis, which ply187n could not lyse. our work demonstrated that generating novel chimeric lysins with an extended lytic spectrum was feasible through fusing a catalytic domain with a cell-binding domain from lysins with lytic spectra across multiple genera.

TI  == [identification of staphylococci directly from positive blood culture bottles by  maldi-tof ms system].
AB  == bloodstream infections are substantial causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. staphylococcus species are the most commonly isolated microorganisms from blood cultures in clinical microbiology laboratories. maldi-tof ms (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time- of- flight mass spectrometry)  system allows the identification of microorganisms directly from positive blood culture bottles. the aim of this study was to evaluate the maldi-tof ms system for the identification of staphylococci directly from the positive blood culture  bottles which revealed the presence of gram-positive cocci by staining. a total of 96 positive blood culture bottles that yielded gram-positive cocci by gram stain were evaluated. these blood cultures were obtained from 69 patients between december 2013-february 2014. conventional methods and bd phoenix automated bacterial identification system (becton dickinson, usa) were used for routine identification. the strains were also identified by real-time taqman pcr (qpcr) which was considered as the reference method. in maldi-tof ms method, maldi sepsityper kit was used for the bacterial identification and all measurements were carried out by using microflex lt instrument and flexcontrol 3.0 software (bruker daltonics, usa). of 96 culture bottles positive for gram-positive cocci,  90 were correctly identified as staphylococci at genus level with all the three study methods (qpcr, bd phoenix, bruker maldi-tof ms). the other six samples were identified as enterococcus faecium (n= 4) and streptococcus pyogenes (n= 2) by both phoenix and the maldi-tof systems. of the 90 samples, 87 were identified at  the species level (15 s.aureus, 33 s.epidermidis, 29 s.hominis, 10 s.haemolyticus) and three at the genus level by the reference qpcr method. when comparing the results obtained by qpcr and bruker maldi-tof ms, incompatibility was detected for three isolates. those isolates were identified as s.hominis by qpcr, however two of them were identified as s.haemolyticus and one as s.epidermidis by maldi-tof ms. compared with real-time taqman pcr it was detected that bruker maldi tof ms was identified 100% of s.aureus to the genus and species level and 100% and 96.6% of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) to the genus and species level, respectively. in conclusion, it was thought that bruker maldi  tof ms system may allow rapid and reliable identification of s.aureus and cns directly from positive blood culture bottles compared with the routine methods used in the clinical microbiology laboratory.

TI  == increase in the prevalence of carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter isolates and ampicillin-resistant non-typhoidal salmonella species in korea: a konsar study conducted in 2011.
AB  == background: antimicrobial surveillance is important for providing an up-to-date understanding of the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance and for creating a  forum for rational drug development. in this study, we analyzed antimicrobial test data generated in 2011 by hospitals and commercial laboratories participating in the korean nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial resistance program (konsar). materials and methods: data on the results of susceptibility tests conducted in 32 hospitals and two commercial laboratories were analyzed. data on isolates from patients admitted to an intensive care unit (icu) and those admitted to other wards were compared. intermediate susceptibility was not analyzed and duplicate isolates were excluded. results: escherichia coli was the  most prevalent organism identified in both the hospital and commercial laboratories. among the hospital isolates, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), penicillin g-non-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, and ampicillin-resistant enterococcus faecium remained as prevalent as they were in 2009. the proportion of vancomycin-resistant e. faecium (vr-efm) slightly decreased from 29% in 2009 to 23% in 2011. resistance rates of klebsiella pneumoniae to ceftazidime, cefoxitin, fluoroquinolone, and amikacin were 24%, 14%, 27%, and 8%, respectively. resistance rates of pseudomonas aeruginosa to fluoroquinolone, ceftazidime, imipenem, and amikacin were 33%, 20%, 22%, and 16%, respectively, whereas those of acinetobacter spp. resistance were 71%, 66%, 64, and 51%, respectively. the prevalence of oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae, carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. and p. aeruginosa, mrsa, and vr-efm among icu isolates was higher than those among non-icu isolates. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing e. coli and k. pneumoniae, imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa, and vr-efm were more prevalent among isolates from commercial laboratories than those from hospitals. resistance rates of k. pneumoniae to ceftazidime and amikacin decreased from 32% and 24% in 2005 to 24%  and 8% in 2011, respectively. the resistance rate of p. aeruginosa to amikacin decreased from 22% in 2005 to 16% in 2011. the proportion of imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. increased from 16% in 2005 to 64% in 2011. conclusions: the prevalence of mrsa, penicillin g-non-susceptible s. pneumoniae, and ampicillin-resistant e. faecium among clinical isolates tested in laboratories remained high. multidrug resistance was more prevalent among isolates from icus.  the prevalence of ceftazidime-resistant and amikacin-resistant k. pneumoniae and  amikacin-resistant p. aeruginosa decreased after 2005, while the prevalence of imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. increased.

TI  == revised reference broth microdilution method for testing telavancin: effect on mic results and correlation with other testing methodologies.
AB  == the reference broth microdilution (bmd) antimicrobial susceptibility testing method for telavancin was revised to include dimethyl sulfoxide (dmso) as a solvent and diluent for frozen-form panel preparation, following the clsi recommendations for water-insoluble agents. polysorbate 80 (p-80) was also added  to the test medium to minimize proven drug losses associated with binding to plastic surfaces. four hundred sixty-two gram-positive isolates, including a challenge set of organisms with reduced susceptibilities to comparator agents, were selected and tested using the revised method for telavancin, and the mic results were compared with those tested by the previously established method and  several sensititre dry-form bmd panel formulations. the revised method provided mic results 2- to 8-fold lower than the previous method when tested against staphylococci and enterococci, resulting in mic50 values of 0.03 to 0.06 mug/ml for staphylococci and 0.03 and 0.12 mug/ml for enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis, respectively. less-significant mic decreases (1 to 2 log2  dilution steps) were observed when testing streptococci in broth supplemented with blood, which showed similar mic50 values for both methods. however, streptococcus pneumoniae had mic50 results of 0.008 and 0.03 mug/ml when tested by the revised and previous methods, respectively. highest essential agreement rates (>/=94.0%) were noted for one candidate dry-form panel formulation compared to the revised test. the revised bmd method provides lower mic results for telavancin, especially when tested against staphylococci and enterococci. this is secondary to the use of dmso for panel production and the presence of p-80, which ensure the proper telavancin testing concentration and result in a more accurate  mic determination. moreover, earlier studies where the previous method was applied underestimated the in vitro drug potency.

TI  == microbial diversity in persistent root canal infections investigated by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == introduction: the aim of the present study was to investigate the composition of  the root canal microbiota in endodontic failures in order to identify and quantify these microorganisms. methods: microbiological samples were taken from 36 root canals with persistent endodontic infection. the presence, levels, and proportions of 79 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the pearson correlation coefficient was used to investigate the relations between bacterial counts and clinical conditions (p </= .05). results:  enterococcus faecium (36%), streptococcus epidermidis (36%), eubacterium saburreum (28%), parvimonas micra (28%), streptococcus sanguis (28%), capnocytophaga sputigena (28%), leptotrichia buccalis (28%), enterococcus faecalis (28%), and staphylococcus warneri (28%) were the most prevalent species; and there was a low prevalence of treponema socranskii (3%), fusobacterium periodonticum (3%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (3%), and spiroplasma ixodetis (3%). the highest mean levels were found for the following species: e. faecium, dialister pneumosintes, staphylococcus epidermidis and helicobacter pylori. there was a statistically significant difference between the levels of gram-negative species and gram-positive species (13.5 x 10(5) vs 6.5 x 10(5), respectively). a  positive correlation was found between the area of the periapical lesion and the  levels of gram-negative and rod species (p < .05). conclusions: the microbiota from teeth with persistent apical periodontitis presents a mixed and complex profile, hosting e. faecium and s. epidermidis as the most highly prevalent species. no correlation was found between any of the species tested and clinical  findings; however, periapical lesions with the largest areas presented higher counts of gram-negative and rod species.

TI  == development of an immunochromatographic test with anti-lipl32-coupled gold nanoparticles for leptospira detection.
AB  == detection of antibody specific to leptospira by various immunological techniques  has been used for leptospirosis diagnosis. however, the sensitivity of antibody detection during the first few days after infection is low. molecular techniques  are suggested to provide earlier diagnosis than antibody detection, but a rapid and easy to perform assay for leptospira antigen detection would provide an additional useful tool for disease diagnosis. in this study, we coupled gold nanoparticles with antibody to lipl32, a protein commonly found in pathogenic leptospira. this coupled gold reagent was used in the immunochromatographic strip for leptospira detection. we demonstrated that the sensitivity of leptospira detection by this strip was 10(3) ml(-1). there was no positive result detected when strips were tested with non-pathogenic leptospira, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus group b, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis or enterococcus faecium. these data suggest that gold nanoparticles coupled with antibody to lipl32 could  be used for leptospira detection by a rapid test based on an immunochromatographic technique.

TI  == the physiology and metabolism of enterococci
AB  == when possible, the authors have provided open reading frame (orf) numbers (ef####) from the extensively annotated e. faecalis v583 genome sequence. this information can be easily accessed at enterocyc.broadinstitute.org. if applicable, non-v583 enterococcal sequences with homology to the annotated orf have been supplied. additionally, we have included iubmb nomenclature for most reactions, which are available at http://www.iubmb.org. enterococci have been isolated and characterized for more than 113 years (maccallum & hastings, 1899).  during the past century, the classification of this genus has been refined, with  the most significant change occurring in 1984 when most members of the group d streptococci, including streptococcus faecalis and streptococcus faecium, were included in the new genus enterococcus (schleifer & kilpper-balz, 1984). this genus currently consists of 37 species that occupy a broad range of habitats that include the gastrointestinal microbiota of nearly every animal phylum (see enterococcus diversity, origins in nature, and gut colonization for details). an  ability to widely colonize is due, at least in part, to their metabolic versatility and intrinsic resistance to inhospitable conditions. despite being unable to form spores, enterococci are highly tolerant to desiccation and can persist for months on dried surfaces. enterococci also tolerate extremes of ph, ionizing radiation, osmotic and oxidative stresses, high heavy metal concentrations, and antibiotics. enterococci survive or grow over a wide range of temperatures for mesophilic bacteria, from 10 to 45 degrees c. these bacteria, as highly evolved commensals, have been extensively used in the food industry and as probiotics to prevent or ameliorate disease. finally, rogue strains of enterococci have emerged on the worldwide stage as multidrug-resistant and hospital-acquired pathogens. enterococci are often simply described as lactic-acid-producing bacteria-a designation that understates their vast metabolic potential. the ubiquitous nature of enterococci in our environment implies this potential. investigations into the remarkable physiology of these bacteria have fluctuated over the past century. prior to publication of the enterococci (huycke m. m., 2002), and now with this volume, the last formal comprehensive review of enterococcal metabolism was written in 1964 (deibel, 1964). at that time, substantial efforts by gunsalus, sokatch, gale, niven, and deibel, among others, focused on the central metabolism of enterococci. since then, research into enterococcal physiology has increasingly used the tools of molecular biology and has shifted toward understanding antibiotic resistance, pathogenesis, and genomics. with this new information, there has been increasing  recognition that many metabolic genes and pathways vary, even within single species, and led investigators to question the concept of a uniform core metabolism for enterococci. to address this perspective and update the available  information on enterococcal physiology, this chapter compiles and reviews the most recent findings from laboratories around the world, and integrates those results with the older literature. as will be evident, the rapid growth of genomic databases continues to offer valuable insights into the physiology of enterococci and greatly facilitates experimental designs into their metabolism.

TI  == animal rennets as sources of dairy lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the microbial composition of artisan and industrial animal rennet pastes was studied by using both culture-dependent and -independent approaches. pyrosequencing targeting the 16s rrna gene allowed to identify 361 operational taxonomic units (otus) to the genus/species level. among lactic acid bacteria (lab), streptococcus thermophilus and some lactobacilli, mainly lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus reuteri, were the most abundant species, with differences among the samples. twelve groups of microorganisms were targeted by viable plate counts revealing a dominance of mesophilic cocci. all rennets were able to acidify ultrahigh-temperature-processed (uht) milk as shown by ph and total titratable acidity (tta). presumptive lab isolated at the highest dilutions of acidified milks were phenotypically characterized, grouped, differentiated at  the strain level by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis, and subjected to 16s rrna gene sequencing. only 18 strains were clearly identified at the species level, as enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii, and streptococcus thermophilus, while the other strains, all belonging to the genus enterococcus, could not be allotted into any previously described species. the phylogenetic analysis showed that these strains might represent different unknown species. all strains were evaluated for their dairy technological performances. all isolates produced diacetyl, and 10 of them produced a rapid ph drop in milk,  but only 3 isolates were also autolytic. this work showed that animal rennet pastes can be sources of lab, mainly enterococci, that might contribute to the microbial diversity associated with dairy productions.

TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

TI  == icesluvan, a 94-kilobase mosaic integrative conjugative element conferring interspecies transfer of vanb-type glycopeptide resistance, a novel bacitracin resistance locus, and a toxin-antitoxin stabilization system.
AB  == a 94-kb integrative conjugative element (icesluvan) transferable to enterococcus  faecium and enterococcus faecalis from an animal isolate of streptococcus lutetiensis consists of a mosaic of genetic fragments from different gram-positive bacteria. a variant of icesluvan was confirmed in s. lutetiensis from a patient. a complete tn5382/tn1549 with a vanb2 operon is integrated into a streptococcal icesde3396-like region harboring a putative bacteriophage exclusion system, a putative agglutinin receptor precursor, and key components of a type iv secretion system. moreover, icesluvan encodes a putative mobc family mobilization protein and a relaxase and, thus, in total has all genetic components essential for conjugative transfer. a 9-kb element within tn5382/tn1549 encodes, among others, putative proteins similar to the tnpx site-specific recombinase in faecalibacterium and vanz in paenibacillus, which may contribute to the detected  low-level teicoplanin resistance. furthermore, icesluvan encodes a novel bacitracin resistance locus that is associated with reduced susceptibility to bacitracin when transferred to e. faecium. the expression of a streptococcal pezat toxin-antitoxin-encoding operon of icesluvan in s. lutetiensis, e. faecium, and e. faecalis was confirmed by reverse transcription (rt)-pcr, indicating an active toxin-antitoxin system which may contribute to stabilizing icesluvan within new hosts. junction pcr and dna sequencing confirmed that icesluvan excised to form a circular intermediate in s. lutetiensis, e. faecalis, and e. faecium. transfer between e. faecalis cells was observed in the presence of helper plasmid pip964. sequence analysis of the original s. lutetiensis donor and enterococcal transconjugants showed that icesluvan integrates in a site-specific  manner into the c-terminal end of the chromosomal trna methyltransferase gene ruma.

TI  == update of contemporary antimicrobial resistance rates across china: reference testing results for 12 medical centers (2011).
AB  == antimicrobial resistance (r) surveillance across asia and especially in china has documented unique patterns and mechanisms. this 2011 study reports results for 2278 isolates from 12 hospitals in china (94-216 strains/site); most from bacteremia (20.4%), pneumonias (29.1%), or skin and skin structure infections (20.9%). samples were tested by reference broth microdilution methods, interpreted by published susceptibility (s) breakpoints. the most common species  were staphylococcus aureus (343, 45.8% mrsa), escherichia coli (ec; 288), pseudomonas aeruginosa (psa; 221), klebsiella spp. (ksp; 208), acinetobacters (acb; 178), enterobacters (155), streptococcus pneumoniae (spn; 154, 46.8% penicillin-s), and enterococci (ent; 137). among 849 gram-positive (gp) cocci, linezolid, tigecycline (tig), daptomycin, and vancomycin provided best antimicrobial coverage (>/=99.7% s). resistance patterns of concern were 0.3% visa, 15.4% teicoplanin non-s coagulase-negative staphylococci, 1.5% vancomycin-r ent (all enterococcus faecium), 1.9% levofloxacin-r beta-haemolytic streptococci, and 35.1 and 12.7% ceftriaxone-non-s rates for spn and viridans group streptococci, respectively. for gram-negative bacilli, r among enterobacteriaceae was highest against beta-lactams (extended spectrum beta-lactamase-phenotype strains at 73.6 and 42.8% in ec and ksp, respectively; carbapenem-r was only 2.1-4.3% with kpc and imp type enzymes detected in ksp). the widest spectrum agents were cefoperazone/sulbactam (79.5-86.1%), piperacillin/tazobactam (88.9-92.0%), tig (98.6-100%), amikacin (amk; 91.8-93.7%), and meropenem (95.7-97.1% s). psa was most inhibited by amk (90.5% s) and colistin (col; 99.5%), with cefepime (67.9%) best among the tested beta-lactams. only col (100%  s) and tig (mic90, 2 mug/ml) showed significant potencies against acb. in conclusion, r among pathogens from 12 chinese hospitals illustrates several agents active against gp pathogens, but more serious r problems were noted among  enterobacteriaceae, psa, and acb. combination treatment for the latter multidrug-r strains appears necessary, guided by local antibiograms and national  surveillance results applying reference methods.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of propolis special extract gh 2002 against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates.
AB  == the need to discover and develop alternative therapies to treat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections is timely. the aim of this study was to  examine the antimicrobial potential of propolis, as a purified and concentrated special extract gh 2002, against clinical isolates of streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-resistent stapylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre) and candida. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics)  and minimal microbicidial concentrations (mmcs) of propolis against microbial pathogens were evaluated using the broth microdilution method. propolis extract gh 2002 revealed low mics in the range of 0.03 to 2 mg/ml against s. pyogenes, s. aureus, e. faecium and candida. a high bactericidal activity of propolis extract  in the range of 0.06 to 1.0 mg/ml was determined for s. pyogenes and s. aureus, however propolis was not bactericidal against e. faecium. propolis concentrations between 0.6 and 2.4 mg/ml displayed fungicidal activity against different candida species. whereas all tested mrsa strains were highly susceptible against propolis, only minor activity was found against vre strains. time-kill curves demonstrated a high antimicrobial activity at low mics already after few hours of incubation against reference strains, clinical antibiotic-susceptible strains, clinical antifungal susceptible strains as well as all tested clinical mrsa strains, but not against vre strains. in conclusion, clinical drug-sensitive as well as some clinical multidrug-resistant microbial isolates, i.e. mrsa, were susceptible to propolis with different degrees of susceptibility. these results suggest that the special propolis extract gh2002 might be used in the development of alternative products for therapy of microbial infections.

TI  == rapid detection of gram-positive organisms by use of the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test and the bact/alert pediatric fan system in a multicenter pediatric evaluation.
AB  == assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. we evaluated the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (bc-gp) in two pediatric hospitals. positive bact/alert pediatric fan blood cultures with gram-positive organisms were tested using the bc-gp in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. to test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles  were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 cfu  per milliliter. a total of 249 gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, and methicillin-resistant s. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%,  respectively. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis  with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. the  bc-gp correctly identified 14/15 cases of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus  faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of streptococcus pneumoniae. it misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with streptococcus anginosus group as s. pneumoniae. the bc-gp detected a case of streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus agalactiae. bc-gp's rapid accurate detection of staphylococcus spp., e. faecium, and e. faecalis and its ability to  ascertain meca, vana, and vanb status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining  to optimal antibiotic use. false-positive s. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the bc-gp.

TI  == lysins: the arrival of pathogen-directed anti-infectives.
AB  == lysins represent a novel class of anti-infectives derived from bacteriophage. lysins are bacterial cell-wall hydrolytic enzymes that selectively and rapidly kill (>/=3 log c.f.u. in 30 min) specific gram-positive bacteria providing a targeted therapeutic approach with minimal impact on unrelated commensal flora. the potential for bacterial resistance to lysins is considered low due to targeting of highly conserved peptidoglycan components. through cutting-edge genetic engineering, lysins can be assembled into large libraries of anti-infective agents tailored to any bacterium of interest including drug-resistant gram-positive pathogens such as meticillin- and vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. lysins can eliminate bacteria systemically and topically from mucosal surfaces and biofilms, as evidenced by experimental models of sepsis, endocarditis, pneumonia, meningitis, and nasopharyngeal, skin and vaginal decolonization. furthermore, lysins can act synergistically with antibiotics and, in the process, resensitize bacteria to non-susceptible antibiotics. clinical trials are being prepared to assess the safety and pharmacokinetic properties of  lysins in humans.

TI  == bacterial spectrum and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bloodstream infections in children with febrile neutropenia: experience of single center in southeast of turkey.
AB  == empirical antimicrobial therapy is usually started in febrile neutropenic patients without having culture results. the aim of this study was to help determine the policies of empirical antibiotic usage in febrile neutropenic children by detecting the antimicrobial susceptibility profile in this group of patients. in this study 811 blood cultures taken from neutropenic children hospitalized at the department of oncology of gaziantep children hospital november 2007 and february 2010 were retrospectively evaluated. blood cultures were routinely collected in aerobic and anaerobic media and incubated using the bactec system. identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the isolates to antimicrobial agents was performed using the vitek2((r)) system according to the recommendations of the clinical and laboratory standards institute. of 811 isolates analyzed, 128 (56.4%) were gram positive cocci, 43 (18.9%) were gram negative bacilli and fungi accounted for 56 (24.7%). the main isolated gram-positive bacteria from blood were coagulase-negative staphylococcus (56.7%), followed by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (14.1%). s. aureus and streptococcus spp. were all susceptible to linezolid, vancomycin and teicoplanin. s aureus was still susceptible to few other antimicrobial agents such as tetracycline (82.4%), chloramphenicol (55.6%). seven e. faecium, 7 e. fecalis and 1 e. hirae was isolated from blood cultures. vancomycin resistance was detected in 6 out of 15 (40%) enterococcus spp. isolates. among gram-negative bacteria e. coli (30.2%) was followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (20.9%) and proteus spp. (18.6%). imipenem (89.2%), meropenem (86.6%), chloramphenicol (88.9%), amicasin (82.4%) and fosfomycin (81.3%) showed highest susceptibility in vitro activity against all gram-negative isolates. to know the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of the pathogens frequently isolated from febrile neutropenic children and to consider this profile before starting an empirical antibiotic therapy would help the clinics which have any role in the treatment of these patients to determine the empirical antibiotic usage policies.

TI  == identification of pathogens in mastitis milk samples with fluorescent in situ hybridization.
AB  == traditionally, the bacteriological examination of mastitis milk samples is performed by culture followed by biochemical tests on the cultured bacteria to allow identification of the causative pathogen. depending on the species involved, this classic identification is time-consuming compared to other techniques such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish), a culture-independent method that utilizes oligonucleotides (labeled with a fluorophore) that are specific to a string of target dna/rna. in the current study, the applicability of fish was evaluated for the detection of mastitis pathogens directly in milk samples. to remove interfering lipids and proteins from mastitis milk samples prior to fish, a previously published enzymatic treatment with savinase was evaluated. fish was performed using oligonucleotides  specific for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, and trueperella (arcanobacterium) pyogenes. the enzymatic pretreatment and the sensitivity of fish were evaluated using spiked whole milk samples and mastitis milk samples with bacterial loads of less than 10(3) up to 10(8) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. bacteria were reliably detected in milk samples with bacterial numbers of 10(6) cfu/ml or higher. however, bacteria present in numbers below 10(6) cfu/ml were not detectable in all cases. the ability of fish to identify mastitis-causing pathogens directly in milk samples, and therefore earlier than classical culture methods, can supplement the classic diagnostic procedures for mastitis milk samples.

AB  == enterococci are predominantly found in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals, but species commonly resident on vegetation are known. their presence in large numbers in foods may indicate a lapse in sanitation and their ability to serve as a genetic reservoir of transferable antibiotic resistance is of concern. conventional culture methods for identification of enterococci are slow and sometimes give false results because of the biochemical diversity of the organisms in this genus. this work reports the development of a pcr-based assay to detect enterococci at the genus level by targeting a 16s rrna sequence. published 16s rrna sequences were aligned and used to design genus specific primers (entf and entr). the primers were able to amplify a 678 bp target region  from enterococcus faecalis atcc 7080 and 20 other strains of enterococci from 11  different species, but there was no amplification by 32 species from closely related genera (pediococcus, lactobacillus, streptococcus and listeria) or species of escherichia coli and salmonella. the pcr positive samples were plated, screened by a colony patch technique and their identities were confirmed by api 20 strep panels and sequencing. when dry fermented sausage and ham as well as fresh meat batter for dry cured sausage manufacture were tested for enterococci by the method, 29 enterococcus strains (15 e. faecalis, 13 e. faecium, and one e. gallinarum) were identified. when susceptibility of these enterococci to 12 antibiotics was tested, the highest incidence of resistance was to clindamycin (89.6%), followed by tetracycline hydrochloride (65.5%), tylosin (62%), erythromycin (45%), streptomycin and neomycin (17%), chloramphenicol (10.3%), penicillin (10.3%), ciprofloxacin (10.3%) and gentamicin (3.4%). none was resistant to the clinically important drugs vancomycin or ampicillin. most strains (27/29) were resistant to more than one antibiotic while 17 of 29 strains were resistant to three to 8 antibiotics. the molecular method developed was validated for speciation of enterococci and was useful in assessing uncooked processed meat products as a reservoir for multi-drug resistant enterococcus species.

TI  == an international activity and spectrum analysis of linezolid: zaaps program results for 2011.
AB  == through a continuing resistance surveillance monitoring program, linezolid was shown to maintain its spectrum and potency against a collection of 8059 clinically relevant gram-positive strains collected from patients at 79 medical centers in 33 countries and hong kong. linezolid mic90 values were 2 mug/ml for methicillin-resistant and -susceptible staphylococcus aureus and enterococci, and the mic90 value was 1 mug/ml for coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), beta-hemolytic streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, and viridans group streptococci. reference broth microdilution susceptibility testing for linezolid  demonstrated a 99.83% susceptibility rate for all organisms. all s. aureus were inhibited by </=2 mug/ml. three (0.3%) of 928 strains of cons had a linezolid mic of 4 mug/ml and contained the cfr resistance gene; 1 also had a mutation in l3. there were 14 linezolid-resistant strains detected from 7 countries (brazil [5],  france [1], germany [2] greece [2], italy [2], ireland [1], and spain [1]) representing 5 species (e. faecium, s. capitis, s. epidermidis, s. hominis, s. lugdenensis). a mobile cfr gene was noted in 2 species having elevated linezolid  mic values; one was a s. haemolyticus isolate with a mic at 4 mug/ml. resistance  rates were as follows for the 6 groups of organisms sampled in the 2011 zaaps program: cons, 1.2%; enterococci, 0.39%; among s aureus, s. pneumoniae, viridans  group streptococci, and beta-hemolytic streptococci, no resistance was detected.  as the activities of commonly used antimicrobials continue to be compromised by evolving resistance mechanisms in gram-positive pathogens, linezolid-resistant strains remain uncommon and without increasing occurrence.

TI  == update of dalbavancin spectrum and potency in the usa: report from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (2011).
AB  == dalbavancin (dal) is an investigational lipoglycopeptide with a prolonged serum half-life allowing once weekly dosing. dal potency was assessed in the 2011 sentry antimicrobial surveillance program among 1555 isolates sampled from all 9  us census regions. monitored gram-positive cocci included staphylococcus aureus (sa; 1,036/50.4% mrsa), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons; 115), enterococcus faecalis (25), e. faecium (31), streptococcus pyogenes (155), streptococcus agalactiae (153), and viridans group streptococci (vgs; 40). all susceptibility (s) testing used clinical and laboratory standards institute reference broth microdilution methods and interpretations. dal (mic(50/90), 0.06/0.06 mug/ml) was 8- and 16-fold more active than daptomycin (dap) and vancomycin (van), respectively against sa, with mssa and mrsa having the same mic(90) results. cons was slightly more dal-s (mic(50), </=0.03mug/ml). the highest staphylococcal dal mic was only 0.25 mug/ml. beta-haemolytic streptococci (betahs) and vgs had dal mic results ranging from </=0.03 to 0.25 mug/ml (mic(90), 0.06-0.12 mug/ml), and only enterococci showed elevated dal mic results. vana phenotype-resistant e. faecalis or e. faecium had dal mic values at >/=1 mug/ml; vanb strains were dal-s (mic, </=0.25 mug/ml). all cited dal quantitative values were consistent with earlier surveillance data (2006-2009), without evidence of mic creep. in conclusion, year 2011 sentry program data for dal documents sustained potent activity against sa, cons, betahs, vgs, and van-s  enterococci, which averaged 4- to 32-fold greater than van, dap, or linezolid.

TI  == verigene(r) gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test.
AB  == bloodstream infections (bsis) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and impose considerable costs on healthcare systems. a key predictor of clinical outcomes in patients with bsis is the early initiation of appropriate targeted antimicrobial therapy. however, with conventional blood culture methods, the gold standard, there is a significant time delay of approximately 2-3 days before clinical results are available, with many patients receiving inappropriate and/or unnecessary antimicrobial therapy in the interim. during the past two decades, the use of in vitro assays that utilize nucleic acid amplification-based detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns has led to a significant reduction in the time (hours vs. days with blood culture) to detection and identification of several of the causative pathogens of bsis and, potentially, earlier initiation of targeted antimicrobial therapy. this review focuses on the  properties and clinical use of one of these molecular diagnostic assays, the verigene((r)) gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (bc-gp), which detects many of the potentially pathogenic gram-positive bacteria associated with bsis, including staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., listeria spp., and enterococcus spp., and specific resistance markers (meca, vana, and vanb). based  on more than 1,600 samples, there was a high degree of agreement between bc-gp test results and those obtained using conventional blood culture and assay methods, irrespective of whether samples were fresh or frozen, and a high degree  of agreement for identification of meca-mediated meticillin resistance in s. aureus and s. epidermidis organisms and vana- or vanb-mediated vancomycin resistance in e. faecalis and e. faecium organisms.

TI  == in vitro activity of telavancin and comparators against selected groups of gram-positive cocci.
AB  == telavancin is a novel, rapidly cidal, dual-action glycopeptide. this study examined its in vitro activity against relevant gram-positive pathogens, comprising 99 meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), 40 meticillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa), 79 coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), 45 enterococcus faecalis, 60 enterococcus faecium, 40 beta-haemolytic streptococci and 60 streptococcus pneumoniae. except with vana enterococci, telavancin mics were tightly clustered and unimodal. telavancin mics for staphylococci ranged from </=0.03 mg/l to 0.5mg/l, with no shift for mrsa or mssa in relation to vancomycin mic. nevertheless, and independently of species, cons with raised vancomycin mics had reduced susceptibility to telavancin, however this was much more marked for teicoplanin. modal telavancin mics were 0.5mg/l and </=0.03 mg/l for glycopeptide-susceptible e. faecalis and e. faecium, respectively, with no rise for vanb isolates, but ranges rose to 4-16 mg/l and 1-4 mg/l for vana isolates, respectively. streptococci were consistently susceptible, with mics of </=0.06 mg/l. telavancin mics by etest agreed within 1  doubling dilution with those found previously by bsac agar dilution in 96.2% of cases, although with slight bias towards lower values. in the few cases (13/345)  where telavancin mics by etest were >/=2 doubling dilutions different from those  by agar dilution, the etest value was always lower; this effect was greater for the other antibiotics tested. telavancin had excellent activity, except against enterococci with vana, with no erosion of this activity against mrsa with raised  vancomycin mics. mics by etest were nearly always within 1 dilution of those by bsac agar dilution.

TI  == enterococcus faecium isolated from lombo, a portuguese traditional meat product:  characterisation of antibacterial compounds and factors affecting bacteriocin production.
AB  == strain st211ch, identified as a strain of enterococcus faecium, isolated from lombo produced a bacteriocin that inhibited the growth of enterococcus spp., listeria spp., klebsiella spp., lactobacillus spp., pseudomonas spp., staphylococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. the mode of action of the bacteriocin  named as bacteriocin st211ch was bactericidal against enterococcus faecalis atcc19443. as determined by tricine-sds-page, the approximate molecular mass of the bacteriocin was 8.0 kda. loss in antimicrobial activity was recorded after treatment with proteolytic enzymes. maximum activity of bacteriocin st211ch was measured in broth cultures of e. faecium strain st211ch after 24 h; thereafter, the activity was reduced. bacteriocin st211ch remained active after exposure to various temperatures and phs, as well as to triton x-100, tween-80, tween-20, sodium dodecyl sulfate, nacl, urea and edta. effect of media components on production of bacteriocin st211ch was also studied. on the basis of pcr reactions targeting different bacteriocin genes, i.e. enterocins, curvacins and sakacins, no evidences for the presence of these genes in the total dna of e. faecium strain st211ch was obtained. the bacterium most probably produced a bacteriocin different from those mentioned above. based on the antimicrobial spectrum, stability and mode of action of bacteriocin st211ch, e. faecium strain st211ch might be considered as a potential candidate with beneficial properties for use in biopreservation to control food spoilage bacteria.

TI  == bacteriocin production, antibiotic susceptibility and prevalence of haemolytic and gelatinase activity in faecal lactic acid bacteria isolated from healthy ethiopian infants.
AB  == the objective of this study was to characterise lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from faecal samples of healthy ethiopian infants, with emphasis on bacteriocin production and antibiotic susceptibility. one hundred fifty lab were  obtained from 28 healthy ethiopian infants. the isolates belonged to lactobacillus (81/150), enterococcus (54/150) and streptococcus (15/150) genera.  lactobacillus species were more abundant in the breast-fed infants while enterococcus dominated the mixed-fed population. bacteriocin-producing lab species were isolated from eight of the infants. many different bacteriocins were identified, including one new bacteriocin from streptococcus salivarius, avicin a (class iia) from enterococcus avium, one class iia bacteriocin from enterococcus  faecalis strains, one unknown bacteriocin from e. faecalis and two unknown bacteriocins from lactobacillus fermentum strains and the two-peptide gassericin  t from lactobacillus gasseri isolate. susceptibility tests performed for nine antibiotics suggest that some lactobacilli might have acquired resistance to erythromycin (3 %) and tetracycline (4 %) only. the streptococci were generally antibiotic sensitive except for penicillin, to which they showed intermediate resistance. all enterococci were susceptible to ampicillin while 13 % showed penicillin resistance. only one e. faecalis isolate was vancomycin-resistant. tetracycline (51 %) and erythromycin (26 %) resistance was prevalent among the enterococci, but multidrug resistance was confined to e. faecalis (47 %) and enterococcus faecium (33 %). screening of enterococcal virulence traits revealed  that 2 % were beta-haemolytic. the structural genes of cytolysin were detected in 28 % of the isolates in five enterococcal species, the majority being e. faecalis and enterococcus raffinosus. this study shows that bacteriocin production and antibiotic resistance is a common trait of faecal lab of ethiopian infants while  virulence factors occur at low levels.

TI  == isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of elderly irish subjects.
AB  == aims: to isolate and characterize bacteriocins produced by predominant species of lactic acid bacteria from faeces of elderly subjects. methods and results: screening over 70,000 colonies, from faecal samples collected from 266 subjects,  using the indicator organisms lactobacillus bulgaricus lmg 6901 and listeria innocua dpc 3572, identified 55 antimicrobial-producing bacteria. genomic fingerprinting following apai digestion revealed 15 distinct strains. the antimicrobial activities associated with 13 of the 15 strains were sensitive to protease treatment. the predominant antimicrobial-producing species were identified as lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus and enterococcus spp. a number of previously characterized bacteriocins, including abp-118 and salivaricin b (from lact. salivarius), enterocin b (enterococcus faecium), lactacin b (lact. acidophilus),  gassericin t and a variant of gassericin a (lact. gasseri), were identified. interestingly, two antimicrobial-producing species, not generally associated with intestinally derived microorganisms were also isolated: lactococcus lactis producing nisin z and streptococcus mutans producing mutacin ii. conclusion: these data suggest that bacteriocin production by intestinal isolates against our chosen targets under the screening conditions used was not frequent (0.08%). significance and impact of the study: the results presented are important due to  growing evidence indicating bacteriocin production as a potential probiotic trait by virtue of strain dominance and/or pathogen inhibition in the mammalian intestine.

TI  == enterococcus and streptococcus spp. associated with chronic and self-medicated urinary tract infections in vietnam.
AB  == background: urinary tract infections (uti) are one of the most common infections  among women worldwide. e. coli often causes more than 75% of acute uncomplicated  uti, however, little is known about how recurrent utis and indiscriminate use of  antimicrobials affect the aetiology of utis. this study aimed to establish the aetiology of uti in a population of recurrent and self-medicated patients referred from pharmacies to a hospital in hanoi, vietnam and to describe genotypes and antimicrobial susceptibility of the associated bacterial pathogens. the aetiology of bacterial pathogens associated with uti (defined as >/= 104 cfu/ml urine) was established by phenotypic and molecular methods. enterococcus faecalis isolates were typed by multi locus sequence typing (mlst), pulsed-field  gel electrophoresis (pfge) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. methods: urine samples from 276 patients suffering symptoms of urinary tract infection were collected and cultured on flexicult agar(r) allowing for detection of the most common urine pathogens. patients were interviewed about underlying diseases, duration of symptoms, earlier episodes of uti, number of episodes diagnosed by doctors and treatment in relation to uti. all tentative e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates were identified to species level by pcr, 16s rrna and partial sequencing of the groel gene. e. faecalis isolates were further characterized by  multi locus sequence typing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. results: mean age of 49 patients was 48 yrs (range was 11-86 yrs) and included 94% women.  on average, patients reported to have suffered from uti for 348 days (range 3 days-10 years, and experienced 2.7 utis during the previous year). cephalosporins were reported the second drug of choice in treatment of uti at the hospital. e. faecalis (55.1%), e. coli (12.2%) and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (8.2%) were main bacterial pathogens. mic testing of e. faecalis showed susceptibility to ampicillin, penicillin and vancomycin, but high-level resistance against gentamicin (48.1%). mlst revealed 12 sequence types (st) of which st 16 made up 44.5% and showed closely related pfge types. conclusion: the  different aetiology of uti compared with reports elsewhere, where e. coli dominates, may be a result of chronic and recurrent utis together with indiscriminate use of antimicrobials. the similar genotypes shown by epidemiologically unrelated st 16 isolates in vietnam and elsewhere, suggest that e. faecalis st 16 might represent a globally distributed clone. treatment of uti  with cephalosporins may select for e. faecalis as it is intrinsic resistant and further studies are needed to establish the source(s) and role of e. faecalis st  16 in acute uti.

TI  == [in vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,866 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2010].
AB  == postmarketing surveillance of levofloxacin (lvfx) has been conducted continuously since 1992. the present survey was performed to investigate in vitro susceptibility of recent clinical isolates in japan to 30 selected antibacterial  agents, focusing on fluoroquinolones (fqs). the common respiratory pathogens streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae continue to show a high susceptibility to fqs. in contrast, widely-prevailing resistance to macrolides was markedly noted among s pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. regarding h. influenzae, the prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant isolates has been increasing year by year (25.8% in 2002, 40.0% in 2004, 50.1% in 2007, and 57.9% in 2010). enterobacteriaceae showed high susceptibility to fqs, however, prevalence of lvfx-resistant escherichia coli, including intermediate resistance, was 29.3%, showing an increase over time. nevertheless, the increase in the prevalence of lvfx-resistant e. coli isolates has slowed since 2007 (8.2% in 2000, 11.8% in 2002, 18.8% in 2004, 26.2% in 2007, and 29.3% in 2010), suggesting the influence  of lvfx 500 mg tablets since its approval in 2009. another enterobacteriaceae member, klebsiella pneumoniae, showed low resistance to fqs, in contrast with e.  coli. in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), the percentage of fq-susceptible isolates was low, at 51.6% for susceptibility to sitafloxacin, and at only around 10% for susceptibility to other fqs. however, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) isolates were highly susceptible to fqs, with the percentage ranging from 88.5% to 99.1%. the prevalence of fqs-resistant  isolates in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci was higher than that in methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, although it was lower than the prevalence of fq-resistance in mrsa. the prevalence of fqs-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates derived from urinary tract infections (utis) was 15.4-21.3%, higher than the prevalence of 6.1-12.3% in p. aeruginosa isolates from respiratory tract infections (rtis). while this trend was consistent with the results of previous surveillance, gradual decreases were  noted in the prevalence of fq-resistant p. aeruginosa isolates derived from utis. the prevalence of multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa was 2.3% among isolates derived from utis and 0.3% among isolates from rtis, a decrease from the results  of 2007. acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to fqs. imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, which is currently an emerging issue, was detected at a  prevalence of 2.4% (13 isolates). neisseria gonorrhoeae showed a high resistance  of 81.3-82.5%, to fqs. ceftriaxone (ctrx) continued to show 100% susceptibility until 2007, but the present survey revealed the advent of resistance to ctrx in some clinical isolates. the result of the present survey indicated that although  methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococcus faecium, p. aeruginosa from utis, n. gonorrhoeae, and e. coli showed resistance of about 20% or more (19.5-89.2%) against the fqs which have been used clinically for over 17 years, the trends observed were similar to the results of previous surveillance. while fq resistance has been prevailing in e. coli, e. coli still shows more than 70% susceptibility to fqs. the other bacterial species maintained high susceptibility rates of greater than 80%, against fqs.

TI  == the changing epidemiology of bacteraemias in europe: trends from the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system.
AB  == we investigated bacteraemia trends for five major bacterial pathogens, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, and determined how expanding antimicrobial resistance influenced the total burden of bacteraemias in europe. aetiological fractions of species and antibiotic phenotypes were extracted from the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system (earss) database for laboratories, which consistently reported between 2002 and 2008. trend analyses used generalized linear models. robustness of results was assessed by iterative analysis for different geographic regions. from 2002 to 2008, the overall number  of reports increased annually by 6.4% (95% confidence interval (ci) 6.2-6.5%), from 46 095 to 67 876. in the subset of laboratories providing denominator information, the overall incidence increased from 0.58/1000 patient-days to 0.90/1000 patient-days (7.2% per year; 95% ci 6.9-7.5%). the frequency of reported bacteraemia isolates of s. aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae increased moderately, while increase in e. coli and enterococcus faecium was more pronounced. bacteraemias caused by methicillin-resistant s. aureus increased until 2005 (7.6% per year; 95% ci 6.1-9.1%), and then decreased (-4.8% per year;  95% ci -6.1 to -3.5%), whereas the number attributable to methicillin-sensitive s. aureus increased continuously (3.4% per year; 95% ci 3.0-3.7). increasing rates of e. coli were mainly caused by antibiotic-resistant phenotypes. our data  suggest that the burden of bacterial bloodstream infection has been increasing for all species during earss surveillance. trends were mainly driven by resistant strains and clearly dissociated between resistant and susceptible isolates. it appears that infections with resistant clones add to rather than replace infections caused by susceptible bacteria. as a consequence, expansion of antibiotic resistance creates an additional strain on healthcare systems.

AB  == silver nanoparticles (nano-ags), which have well-known antimicrobial properties,  are used extensively in various medical and general applications. in this study,  the combination effects between nano-ags and the conventional antibiotics ampicillin, chloramphenicol and kanamycin against various pathogenic bacteria were investigated. the mic and fractional inhibitory concentration index (fici) were determined to confirm antibacterial susceptibility and synergistic effects.  the results showed that nano-ags possessed antibacterial effects and synergistic  activities. the antibiofilm activities of nano-ags alone or in combination with antibiotics were also investigated. formation of biofilm is associated with resistance to antimicrobial agents and chronic bacterial infections. the results  indicated that nano-ags also had antibiofilm activities. to understand these effects of nano-ags, an atpase inhibitor assay, permeability assay and hydroxyl radical assay were conducted. the antibacterial activity of nano-ags was influenced by atp-associated metabolism rather than by the permeability of the outer membrane. additionally, nano-ags generated hydroxyl radicals, a highly reactive oxygen species induced by bactericidal agents. it was concluded that nano-ags have potential as a combination therapeutic agent for the treatment of infectious diseases by bacteria.

TI  == [antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria in 2008].
AB  == the activity of antibacterial agents against aerobic gram-positive cocci (25 genus or species, 1029 strains) and anaerobic bacteria (21 genus or species, 187  strains) isolated from clinical specimens in 2008 at 16 clinical facilities in japan were studied using either broth microdilution or agar dilution method. the  ratio of methicillin-resistant strains among staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis was 59.6% and 81.2%, suggesting that resistant strains were isolated at high frequency. vancomycin (vcm), linezolid (lzd) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (qpr/dpr) had good antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, with mic90s of < or = 2 microg/ml. the ratio of penicillin (pc) intermediate and resistant strains classified by mutations of pc-binding proteins among streptococcus pneumoniae was 92.0% that was highest among our previous reports. cefpirome, carbapenems, vcm, teicoplanin (teic), lzd and qpr/dpr had mic90s of <  or = 1 microg/ml against pc-intermediate and resistant s. pneumoniae strains. against all strains of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, the mics of vcm and teic were under 2 microg/ml, and no resistant strain was detected, suggesting that these agents had excellent activities against these species. 15.9% of e. faecalis strains and 1.2% of e. faecium strains showed intermediate to lzd. 17.1% of e. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to qpr/dpr.  against all strains of clostridium difficile, the mic of vcm was under 1 microg/ml, suggesting that vcm had excellent activity. carbapenems showed good activity against clostridiales, bacteroides spp., and prevotella spp., but one strain of bacteroides fragilis showed resistant to carbapenems. and so, the susceptibility of this species should be well-focused in the future at detecting  continuously.

TI  == clinical study of distribution and drug resistance of pathogens in patients with  severe acute pancreatitis.
AB  == background: previous researches about necrotic pancreatic tissue infections are numerous, but the study on systemic infection related to the severe acute pancreatitis (sap) treatment period is limited. this study aimed to investigate the distribution and drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria in patients who had hepatobiliary surgery for sap during the past three years. methods: a retrospective study was conducted on the distribution, category and drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria in patients who had hepatobiliary surgery for sap from 2008 to 2011. results: a total of 594 pathogenic bacteria samples were isolated. among them 418 isolates (70.4%) were gram bacteria negative, 142 isolates (23.9%) were gram bacteria positive, and 34 isolates (5.7%) were found fungi. the most common gram negative bacteria were escherichia coli (19.8%), and  the dominant gram positive pathogenic bacteria were enterococcus faecium. the distribution of sap-related infectious pathogens was mainly in peritoneal drainage fluid, sputum, bile, and wound secretions. almost all the gram negative  pathogenic bacteria were sensitive to carbapenum. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) producing strains were more resistant to penicillins and  cephalosprins than the esbls non-producing strains. staphylococcus was sensitive  to vancomycin and linezolid. the drug resistance of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus (mrs) to commonly used antibiotics was higher than meticillin-sensitive streptococcus (mss). enterococcus sp. exhibited lower drug-resistance rates to vancomycin and linezolid. conclusions: gram negative bacteria were the dominant sap-related infection after hepatobiliary surgery. a high number of fungal infections were reported. drug resistant rates were high. rational use of antibiotics according to the site of infection, bacterial species and drug sensitivity, correctly executing the course of treatment and enhancing hand washing will contribute to therapy and prevention of sap-related infection and decrease its mortality.

TI  == ceftaroline fosamil in the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections.
AB  == ceftaroline fosamil is a cephalosporin antibacterial approved by the us food and  drug administration (fda) for use in the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (absssi) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (cabp). after intravenous administration, ceftaroline fosamil is rapidly converted to its bioactive metabolite, ceftaroline. ceftaroline has broad-spectrum in vitro activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including contemporary resistant gram-positive phenotypes, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and multidrug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. because of its unique spectrum of activity, the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) designated ceftaroline as a member of a new subclass of beta-lactam antimicrobials, cephalosporins with anti-mrsa activity. the activity of ceftaroline against s. aureus extends to heteroresistant vancomycin-intermediate, vancomycin-intermediate, vancomycin-resistant and daptomycin-nonsusceptible isolates. ceftaroline has low  minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) for all tested species of streptococci,  and has potent activity against s. pneumoniae isolates with varying degrees of penicillin resistance. the activity of ceftaroline is limited against enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium and against anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis. the in vitro activity of ceftaroline includes many gram-negative pathogens, but does not extend to bacteria that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, class b metallo-beta-lactamases or ampc cephalosporinases, or to most nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli. ceftaroline  fosamil has been studied for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssi) and community-acquired pneumonia (cap) in phase iii randomized, double-blind, international, multicentre noninferiority clinical trials. two identical trials (canvas 1 and canvas 2) compared the efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil with that of vancomycin plus aztreonam in 1378 adults with csssi. results demonstrated that ceftaroline was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam, with 91.6% in the ceftaroline fosamil group (pooled analysis) achieving clinical response compared with 92.7% in the vancomycin plus aztreonam  group (difference -1.1%, 95% ci -4.2, 2.0). an additional analysis evaluated clinical cure in a subgroup of patients who met the fda guidance definition of absssi at treatment day 3. clinical response, defined as cessation of lesion spread and absence of fever, was 74.0% in the ceftaroline fosamil group compared  with 66.2% in the vancomycin plus aztreonam group (treatment difference 7.8%, 95% ci 1.3, 14.0). clinical efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil in 1240 hospitalized adults with cap was compared with that of ceftriaxone in two additional phase iii trials (focus 1 and focus 2). of note, because ceftriaxone does not have activity against mrsa, patients with confirmed or suspected mrsa cap were excluded from the focus trials. results demonstrated that ceftaroline was noninferior to ceftriaxone, with 84.3% in the ceftaroline fosamil group achieving clinical cure  compared with 77.7% in the ceftriaxone group (difference 6.7%, 95% ci 1.6, 11.8). an additional analysis of the trials was conducted in patients with moderate to severe cap and at least one proven typical bacterial pathogen at baseline (i.e. cabp). day 4 clinical response rates were 69.5% for ceftaroline and 59.4% for ceftriaxone (difference 10.1%, 95% ci -0.6, 20.6). in the phase iii trials, adverse event rates were similar between groups. overall, ceftaroline is well tolerated, which is consistent with the good safety and tolerability profile of the cephalosporin class. in summary, ceftaroline fosamil is a broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporin with excellent in vitro activity against resistant gram-positive pathogens, including mrsa, as well as many common gram-negative organisms. it is a welcome treatment option for absssi and cabp.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance among gram-positive pathogens in saudi arabia.
AB  == several species of gram-positive cocci are major nosocomial or community pathogens associated with morbidity and mortality. here, we review the antimicrobial resistance among these pathogens in saudi arabia. in the last decades, antimicrobial resistance has increased among staphylococcus aureus in the kingdom with a growing prevalence of both nosocomial and community methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) isolates. as yet, no vancomycin-resistant  mrsa have been reported, although isolates with reduced susceptibility to the drug have been noted. currently, the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant entrococci (vre) is low; however, vre has been described in the kingdom as well as enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium isolates with high-level resistance to penicillin, sulfamethoxazole, macrolides, tetracycline, and aminoglycosides. in recent decades, the prevalence and rate of penicillin resistance and non-susceptibility among streptococcus pneumoniae isolates have increased in saudi arabia. the organism remains, however, susceptible to other beta-lactams and to quinolones. on the other hand, resistance to co-trimoxazole and tetracyclines is high and resistance to macrolides is on the increase.

TI  == improved identification including maldi-tof mass spectrometry analysis of group d streptococci from bovine mastitis and subsequent molecular characterization of corresponding enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium isolates.
AB  == we examined 199 group d streptococci isolated from clinically defined and epidemiologically unrelated cases of bovine mastitis. samples were collected during a 5-month period from 2010 to 2011 from diseased animals in 199 herds (1 isolate per herd) raised in different counties and federal states in germany. a classical enterococcal species identification procedure started with pyrase and catalase assays, growth on enterococcoselagar((r)) and gcg((r)) agar plates and in 6.5% nacl followed by a biochemical reaction panel. all 199 isolates were also subjected to maldi-tof ms diagnostics in which a simple and an extended direct transfer protocol were compared. the latter revealed a much better performance (higher log (score) values) although the same result was obtained in all but three cases. classical and maldi tof ms analyses identified 64 enterococcus faecalis and 37 enterococcus faecium isolates which were confirmed by species-specific pcrs. these 101 enterococcal isolates did not display a specific multi-resistance phenotype and resistances to glycopeptides and antibiotics of last resort (linezolid, daptomycin, tigecycline) were absent, resistance to tetracycline was the most frequent resistance feature. molecular typing of the 64 e. faecalis isolates revealed 3 main pfge clusters of related strains represented by three mlst types (st40, st211, st268). pfge and mlst analysis of e. faecium isolates revealed several smaller clusters of only a few related strains and identified a number of previously unknown allele and mlst types (n=6; st624-st629) besides known variants (st22, st32). one of the 37 e. faecium strains showed properties of hospital-associated e. faecium strains (ampicillin resistance, is16-positive; mlst cc17).

TI  == hiv-1 integrase inhibitor-inspired antibacterials targeting isoprenoid biosynthesis.
AB  == we report the discovery of antibacterial leads, keto- and diketo-acids, targeting two prenyl transferases: undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase (upps) and dehydrosqualene synthase (crtm). the leads were suggested by the observation that keto- and diketo-acids bind to the active site mg(2+)/asp domain in hiv-1 integrase, and similar domains are present in prenyl transferases. we report the  x-ray crystallographic structures of one diketo-acid and one keto-acid bound to crtm, which supports the mg(2+) binding hypothesis, together with the x-ray structure of one diketo-acid bound to upps. in all cases, the inhibitors bind to  a farnesyl diphosphate substrate-binding site. compound 45 had cell growth inhibition mic(90) values of ~250-500 ng/ml against s. aureus, 500 ng/ml against  bacillus anthracis, 4 mug/ml against listeria monocytogenes and enterococcus faecium, and 1 mug/ml against streptococcus pyogenes m1, but very little activity against e. coli (dh5alpha, k12) or human cell lines.

TI  == exploration of the chemical space of novel naphthalene-sulfonamide and anthranilic acid-based inhibitors of penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  == penicillin-binding proteins are a well established, validated and still a very promising target for the design and development of new antibacterial agents. based on our previous discovery of several noncovalent small-molecule inhibitor hits for resistant pbps we decided to additionally explore the chemical space around these compounds. in order to clarify their structure-activity relationships for pbp inhibition two new series of compounds were synthesized, characterized and evaluated biochemically: the derivatives of anthranilic acid and naphthalene-sulfonamide derivatives. the target compounds were tested for their inhibitory activities on three different transpeptidases: pbp2a from methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) strains, pbp5fm from enterococcus faecium strains, and pbp1b from streptococcus pneumoniae strains. the most promising results for both of these series of compounds were obtained against the pbp2a enzyme with the ic50 values in the micromolar range. although these results do not represent a significant breakthrough in the field of noncovalent pbp inhibitors, they do provide useful structure-activity relationship data, and thus a more solid basis for the design of potent and noncovalent inhibitors of resistant pbps.

TI  == clinical streptococci and their sensitivity to enterocins produced by different strains of the species enterococcus faecium (short communication).
AB  == in children, acute otitis media (aom) is one of the most frequently occurring infections caused by streptococcus pneumoniae and str. pyogenes. the standard treatment of aomis provided by antibiotics; however, an increased resistance of the causative agents to antibiotics requires the need to search for innovations.  this study was focused on in vitro testing sensitivity of streptococci isolated from aom to enterocins produced by 9 different origin strains of e. faecium. enterocins (ent) represent ribosomally synthesized proteinaceous substances with  antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and/or gram-negative bacteria which  are produced mostly by strains of the species enterococcus faecium. str. pneumoniae were sensitive at least to 1 ent. str. pneumoniae spn 754 was sensitive to 5 ent. five str. pyogenes were sensitive to enterocins. ent a (p) inhibited the growth of 3 str. pneumoniae, and 4 str. pyogenes (activity between  100 and 3,200 au/ml). most of ent inhibited the growth of streptococci tested (100-3,200 au/ml). str. pyogenes were more sensitive to ent than str. pneumoniae. although more detailed further studies are required, our results indicate a new possibility for enterocin use.

TI  == comparison of nitroethane, 2-nitro-1-propanol, lauric acid, lauricidin(r) and the hawaiian marine algae, chaetoceros, for potential broad-spectrum control of anaerobically grown lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the gastrointestinal tract of bovines often contains bacteria that contribute to  disorders of the rumen, and may also contain foodborne or opportunistic human pathogens as well as bacteria capable of causing mastitis in cows. thus there is  a need to develop broad-spectrum therapies that are effective while not leading to unacceptably long antibiotic withdrawal times. the effects of the ch(4)-inhibitors nitroethane (2 mg/ml), 2-nitro-1-propanol (2 mg/ml), lauric acid (5 mg/ml), the commercial product lauricidin(r) (5 mg/ml), and a finely ground product of the hawaiian marine algae, chaetoceros (10 mg/ml), were compared in pure cultures of streptococcus agalactia, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus bovis, and in a mixed lactic acid rumen bacterial culture. lauricidin(r) and lauric acid exhibited the most bactericidal acidity against all bacteria. these results suggest potential animal health benefits from supplementing cattle diets  with lauric acid or lauricidin(r) to improve the health of the rumen and help prevent shedding of human pathogens.

TI  == minim typing--a rapid and low cost mlst based typing tool for klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  == here we report a single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) based genotyping method for klebsiella pneumoniae utilising high-resolution melting (hrm) analysis of fragments within the multilocus sequence typing (mlst) loci. the approach is termed mini-mlst or minim typing and it has previously been applied to streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium. six snps  were derived from concatenated mlst sequences on the basis of maximisation of the simpsons index of diversity (d). dna fragments incorporating these snps and predicted to be suitable for hrm analysis were designed. using the assumption that hrm alleles are defined by g+c content, minim typing using six fragments was predicted to provide a d = 0.979 against known sts. the method was tested against 202 k. pneumoniae using a blinded approach in which the mlst analyses were performed after the hrm analyses. the hrm-based alleles were indeed in accordance with g+c content, and the minim typing identified known sts and flagged new sts.  the tonb mlst locus was determined to be very diverse, and the two minim fragments located herein contribute greatly to the resolving power. however these fragments are refractory to amplification in a minority of isolates. therefore, we assessed the performance of two additional formats: one using only the four fragments located outside the tonb gene (d = 0.929), and the other using hrm data from these four fragments in conjunction with sequencing of the tonb mlst fragment (d = 0.995). the hrm assays were developed on the rotorgene 6000, and the method was shown to also be robust on the lightcycler 480, allowing a 384-well high through-put format. the assay provides rapid, robust and low-cost typing with fully portable results that can directly be related to current mlst data. minim typing in combination with molecular screening for antibiotic resistance markers can be a powerful surveillance tool kit.

TI  == serotypes and antibiotic resistance in group b streptococcus isolated from patients at the maternity hospital, kuwait.
AB  == a total of 143 group b streptococcus (gbs) isolates collected from mothers at the maternity hospital in kuwait were investigated for their serotypes and antibiotic resistance, and screened by pcr for the carriage of genes for resistance to tetracycline (tetk, tetm, tetl, teto), erythromycin (erma, ermb, ermc, ermtr, ermm, mefa, mefe, msra) and aminoglycosides (aph3, ant4, ant6). all isolates were serotyped using a latex agglutination test. most of the isolates belonged to serotypes v (38.5 %), iii (20.9 %), ia (7.7 %) and ii (11.2 %). sixteen isolates  (11.2 %) were nontypable. all isolates were susceptible to penicillin, ampicillin and cefotaxime (mics 0.016-0.094 microg ml(-1)) but were resistant to trimethoprim (92.3 %), tetracycline (89.5 %), minocycline (89.5 %), high-level kanamycin (76.9 %), chloramphenicol (30.0 %), erythromycin (12.6 %), clindamycin  (7.0 %), high-level streptomycin (3.5 %) and ciprofloxacin (0.7 %). the tetracycline-resistant isolates contained tetm (94.5 %), teto (3.9 %), tetl (1.6  %) and tetk (0.8 %). the erythromycin-resistant isolates contained ermb (61.1 %), ermtr (38.9 %), erma (5.5 %), mefa (5.5 %) and mefe (11 %). all high-level kanamycin-resistant isolates contained aph3. one of the high-level streptomycin-resistant isolates contained ant6. partial dna sequencing of aph3 revealed sequences with 99 % similarity to aph3 found in enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, suggesting that the gbs isolates could have acquired aph3 from other gram-positive cocci. the high proportion of isolates with resistance to tetracycline, high-level kanamycin and trimethoprim, and the increase in the prevalence of erythromycin resistance, represents an emerging public health concern that needs further surveillance.

TI  == influence of synthetic peptide inducers on antibacterial activity of enterococci.
AB  == antibacterial activity of probiotic enterococci is often related to the production of bacteriocins. there is a variety of enterococcus faecium strains which synthesise one or several enterocins including a, b, p, 96, l50ab and others. in this work we have analysed the probiotic strain e. faecium l3 whose genome contained the genes encoding enterocins capital a, cyrillic, capital ve, cyrillic and a three-component regulatory system. all these genes were found to be expressed in enterococcal strain l3. antimicrobial activity of the strain tested on the strains of listeria monocytogenes and streptococcus agalactiae was  pheromone dependent. chemically synthesised cyclic peptides (analogues and shorter derivates of entf) with different molecular structures were able to increase the antagonistic activity of the strain e. faecium l3 in contrast to the strain e. faecium sf68, which does nsmall o, cyrillict have genes encoding enterocins capital a, cyrillic and capital ve, cyrillic.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of daptomycin tested against gram-positive strains collected in european hospitals: results from 7 years of resistance surveillance  (2003-2009).
AB  == daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide approved by the european medicines agency (emea) for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cssti) and staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis. we evaluated the in vitro  activity of daptomycin and comparators tested against clinical isolates from european hospitals over a 7-year period (2003-2009). a total of 36,769 consecutive isolates were collected in 34 medical centers located in 13 european  countries, turkey and israel. the collection included s. aureus (18,352; 27.2% oxacillin-resistant [mrsa]); coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons; 6,874), enterococcus spp. (7,241; 9.4% vancomycin-resistant), beta-hemolytic (3,009), viridans group streptococci (1,176), and streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus (107).  the organisms were isolated mainly from patients with bloodstream infection (56%) or cssti (23%). daptomycin was very active against s. aureus and cons (mic(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mg/l for both organisms), and its activity was not adversely influenced by oxacillin resistance. all enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to daptomycin (mic(50/90), 1/1 mg/l). daptomycin (mic(50/90), 2/2 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) and linezolid (mic(50/90), 1/2 mg/l; 99.7% susceptible) were the most active agents tested against vancomycin-resistant e. faecium. vancomycin- resistant and -susceptible enterococcal strains were equally susceptible to daptomycin. daptomycin was also active against beta-hemolytic streptococci (mic(50/90), 0.06/0.25 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible), viridans group streptococci (mic(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mg/l; 99.8% susceptible) and s. bovis (mic(50/90), 0.06/0.12 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible).in summary, daptomycin was very  potent against this large collection (36,769) of gram-positive organisms isolated in european hospitals, and its activity remained stable across the 7-year period  evaluated (2003-2009), using reference methods and interpretive criteria. decreases in daptomycin potency were not observed since emea approval and widespread clinical use, and emerging resistance to other compounds did not adversely influence daptomycin activity against contemporary gram-positive species.

TI  == further increases in carbapenem-, amikacin-, and fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates of acinetobacter spp. and p. aeruginosa in korea: konsar study 2009.
AB  == purpose: the increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistant bacteria has become a serious worldwide problem. the aim of this study was to analyze antimicrobial resistance data generated in 2009 by hospitals and commercial laboratories participating in the korean nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial resistance program. materials and methods: susceptibility data were collected from 24 hospitals and two commercial laboratories. in the analysis, resistance did not include intermediate susceptibility. duplicate isolates were excluded from the analysis of hospital isolates, but not from the commercial laboratory isolates. results: among the hospital isolates, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, penicillin g-nonsusceptible streptococcus pneumoniae based on meningitis  breakpoint, and ampicillin- resistant enterococcus faecium remained highly prevalent. the proportion of vancomycin-resistant e. faecium gradually increased  to 29%. ceftazidime-resistant escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae increased to 17% and 33%, respectively, and fluoroquinolone-resistant k. pneumoniae, acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa increased to 33%, 67% and 39%, respectively. amikacin-resistant acinetobacter spp. increased to 48%. imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. and p. aeruginosa increased to 51% and 26%, respectively. higher resistance rates were observed in intensive care unit (icu)  isolates than in non-icu isolates among the isolates from hospitals. resistance rates were higher in hospital isolates than in clinic isolates among the isolates from commercial laboratories. conclusion: among the hospital isolates, ceftazidime-resistant k. pneumoniae and fluoroquinolone- resistant k. pneumoniae, acinetobacter spp., and p. aeruginosa further increased. the increase in imipenem resistance was slight in p. aeruginosa, but drastic in acinetobacter spp. the problematic antimicrobial-organism combinations were much more prevalent among icu isolates.

TI  == persistent, toxin-antitoxin system-independent, tetracycline resistance-encoding  plasmid from a dairy enterococcus faecium isolate.
AB  == a tetracycline-resistant (tet(r)) dairy enterococcus faecium isolate designated m7m2 was found to carry both tet(m) and tet(l) genes on a 19.6-kb plasmid. after  consecutive transfer in the absence of tetracycline, the resistance-encoding plasmid persisted in 99% of the progenies. dna sequence analysis revealed that the 19.6-kb plasmid contained 28 open reading frames (orfs), including a tet(m)-tet(l)-mob gene cluster, as well as a 10.6-kb backbone highly homologous (99.9%) to the reported plasmid pre25, but without an identified toxin-antitoxin  (ta) plasmid stabilization system. the derived backbone plasmid without the tet(r) determinants exhibited a 100% retention rate in the presence of acridine orange, suggesting the presence of a ta-independent plasmid stabilization mechanism, with its impact on the persistence of a broad spectrum of resistance-encoding traits still to be elucidated. the tet(m)-tet(l) gene cluster from m7m2 was functional and transmissible and led to acquired resistance in enterococcus faecalis og1rf by electroporation and in streptococcus mutans ua159  by natural transformation. southern hybridization showed that both the tet(m) and tet(l) genes were integrated into the chromosome of s. mutans ua159, while the whole plasmid was transferred to and retained in e. faecalis og1rf. quantitative  real-time reverse transcription-pcr (rt-pcr) indicated tetracycline-induced transcription of both the tet(m) and tet(l) genes of pm7m2. the results indicated that multiple mechanisms might have contributed to the persistence of antibiotic  resistance-encoding genes and that the plasmids pm7m2, pip816, and pre25 are likely correlated evolutionarily.

TI  == high-level fluorescence labeling of gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == fluorescence labeling of bacterial pathogens has a broad range of interesting applications including the observation of living bacteria within host cells. we constructed a novel vector based on the e. coli streptococcal shuttle plasmid pat28 that can propagate in numerous bacterial species from different genera. the plasmid harbors a promoterless copy of the green fluorescent variant gene egfp under the control of the camp-factor gene (cfb) promoter of streptococcus agalactiae and was designated pbsu101. upon transfer of the plasmid into streptococci, the bacteria show a distinct and easily detectable fluorescence using a standard fluorescence microscope and quantification by facs-analysis demonstrated values that were 10-50 times increased over the respective controls. to assess the suitability of the construct for high efficiency fluorescence labeling in different gram-positive pathogens, numerous species were transformed. we successfully labeled streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus aureus strains utilizing the egfp reporter plasmid pbsu101. in all of these species the presence of the cfb promoter construct resulted in high-level egfp expression that could be further increased by growing the streptococcal and enterococcal cultures under high oxygen conditions through continuous aeration.

TI  == population biology of gram-positive pathogens: high-risk clones for dissemination of antibiotic resistance.
AB  == infections caused by multiresistant gram-positive bacteria represent a major health burden in the community as well as in hospitalized patients. staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium are well-known pathogens of hospitalized patients, frequently linked with resistance  against multiple antibiotics, compromising effective therapy. streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes are important pathogens in the community and s. aureus has recently emerged as an important community-acquired pathogen. population genetic studies reveal that recombination prevails as a driving force  of genetic diversity in e. faecium, e. faecalis, s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes, and thus, these species are weakly clonal. although recombination has a relatively modest role driving the genetic variation of the core genome of s. aureus, the horizontal acquisition of resistance and virulence genes plays a key  role in the emergence of new clinically relevant clones in this species. in this  review, we discuss the population genetics of e. faecium, e. faecalis, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and s. aureus. knowledge of the population structure of these pathogens is not only highly relevant for (molecular) epidemiological research but also for identifying the genetic variation that underlies changes in clinical behaviour, to improve our understanding of the pathogenic behaviour of particular clones and to identify novel targets for vaccines or immunotherapy.

TI  == tn916-like genetic elements: a diverse group of modular mobile elements conferring antibiotic resistance.
AB  == antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacteria are responsible for morbidity and mortality in healthcare environments. enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae can all exhibit clinically relevant multidrug resistance phenotypes due to acquired resistance genes on mobile genetic elements. it is possible that clinically relevant multidrug-resistant clostridium difficile strains will appear in the future, as the organism is adept at acquiring mobile genetic elements (plasmids and transposons). conjugative transposons of the tn916/tn1545 family, which carry major antibiotic resistance determinants, are transmissible between these different bacteria by a conjugative mechanism during which the elements are excised by a staggered cut from donor cells, converted to a circular form, transferred by cell-cell contact and inserted into recipient cells by a site-specific recombinase. the ability of these conjugative transposons to acquire additional, clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes importantly contributes to the emergence of multidrug resistance.

TI  == new noncovalent inhibitors of penicillin-binding proteins from penicillin-resistant bacteria.
AB  == background: penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) are well known and validated targets for antibacterial therapy. the most important clinically used inhibitors  of pbps beta-lactams inhibit transpeptidase activity of pbps by forming a covalent penicilloyl-enzyme complex that blocks the normal transpeptidation reaction; this finally results in bacterial death. in some resistant bacteria the resistance is acquired by active-site distortion of pbps, which lowers their acylation efficiency for beta-lactams. to address this problem we focused our attention to discovery of novel noncovalent inhibitors of pbps. methodology/principal findings: our in-house bank of compounds was screened for inhibition of three pbps from resistant bacteria: pbp2a from methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), pbp2x from streptococcus pneumoniae strain 5204, and pbp5fm from enterococcus faecium strain d63r. initial hit inhibitor obtained by screening was then used as a starting point for computational similarity searching for structurally related compounds and several new noncovalent inhibitors were discovered. two compounds had promising inhibitory activities of both pbp2a and pbp2x 5204, and good in-vitro antibacterial activities against a panel of gram-positive bacterial strains. conclusions: we found new noncovalent inhibitors of pbps which represent important starting points for development of more potent inhibitors of pbps that  can target penicillin-resistant bacteria.

TI  == [trends of antimicrobial resistance in microbial strains isolated from invasive infections in romania. experience of participation in earss (european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system), 2002-2008].
AB  == earss (european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system) is the biggest antimicrobial resistance surveillance project in the world financed from public finds, aiming to provide validated and comparable official data on antimicrobial  resistance of invasive microbial strains (isolated from blood and csf), belonging to 6 indicator bacterial species, i.e.: s. aureus, e. coli, e. faecium/faecalis,  str. pneumoniae, ps. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae. romania reported data to earss since 2002 so far. though the number of participating laboratories increased progressively from 12 to 35, the number of hospitals which reported for earss. as the number of strains included in the data base remained steady and relatively low. this issue is related to the particular position of romania in the european  context, in respect of the very low number of blood cultures performed in hospitals. our paper is presenting the trends of antimicrobial resistance in the  indicator strains in the 2002-2008 interval. during the 2002-2008 interval, romania reported to earss a total number of 1276 bacterial strains, distributed by species as follows: 513 s aureus, 369 e. coli, 128 streptococcus pneumoniae, 127 enterococcus spp.. 71 klebsiella pneumoniae, 68 pseudomonas aeruginosa. klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were reported, according to the  earss protocol, only for the 2005-2008 interval. it is difficult to describe trends, specially in enterococcus, streptococcus pneumonaie and the 2 species collected only since 2005, because of the low number of isolates, but there are several results that are supporting us to claim that antimicrobial resistance in  invasive isolates is a real problem in romanian hospitals, like in other central, southern and south eastern european countries: more than 25% of s. aureus strains resistant to methicilline, with more than 50% in some years, high aminoglycozides resistance in more than 70-80% of enterococcus faecium invasive strains, more than 80% of strains resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporines etc.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate dressing against a broad spectrum of clinically relevant wound isolates.
AB  == wound dressings impregnated with silver have a role to play in aiding to reduce both the dressing and wound microbial bioburden. it is therefore imperative that  antimicrobial wound dressings have efficacy on a broad range of clinical significant microorganisms. accordingly, this study aimed to determine the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate dressing against 115 wound isolates that had been isolated routinely from patients at west virginia university hospital. standardised corrected zones of inhibition (czois) were performed on all clinical isolates. it was found that the silver alginate dressing was able to inhibit the growth of all microorganisms tested. in particular, the silver alginate dressing inhibited the growth of candida albicans and yeasts with czoi of 3-11.5 mm. all meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) strains were  found to be sensitive to the silver alginate dressing with a czoi range calculated at 3-7.8 mm. sensitivity to the silver alginate dressing was also evident for s. aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. czois of 4.25 mm were calculated for enterococcus faecium and 9.8 mm for viridans streptococcus. the bacteria which demonstrated the highest tolerance to ionic silver included enterobacter cloacae and acinetobacter baumannii. contrary to this the most responsive microorganisms to ionic silver included strains of staphylococci, viridans streptococcus and candida albicans. no antibiotic-resistant isolates, as identified by kirby bauer clinical laboratory standards institute classification  system, were found to be resistant to ionic silver. when a selected number of microorganisms were grown in the biofilm phenotypic state enhanced tolerance to silver was observed, compared to their non biofilm counterparts. overall, this study has demonstrated the broad antimicrobial activity of a silver alginate dressing on wound isolates grown in the non biofilm and biofilm state. this finding is clinically relevant as both the non biofilm and biofilm phenotypic states of microorganisms are evident in wounds and therefore significant to delayed healing. consequently, it is imperative that antimicrobial wound dressings demonstrate antimicrobial activity against microorganisms in both phenotypic states.

AB  == linezolid (zyvox) is the first member of an entirely new class of antibiotics to  reach the market in over 35 years; it was approved for use in 2000. a member of the oxazolidinone class of antibiotics, linezolid is highly effective for the treatment of serious gram-positive infections and has activity that compares favorably with vancomycin for most clinically relevant pathogens. zyvox is approved for use against serious gram-positive infections, including those caused by streptococcus pneumoniae, and the very challenging methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium organisms. zyvox inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to 23s rrna in the catalytic site of the 50s ribosome. it can be administered both orally and intravenously and has good tissue distribution. recent results have demonstrated  that oxazolidinone analogs related to linezolid are effective in treating pulmonary tuberculosis caused by resistant mycobacterium tuberculosis in animal infection models and suggest additional new therapeutic applications for these antibiotics.

TI  == [antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria in 2006].
AB  == the activity of antibacterial agents against aerobic gram-positive cocci (26 species, 1022 strains) and anaerobic bacteria (23 species, 184 strains) isolated  from clinical specimens in 2006 at 16 clinical facilities in japan were studied using either broth microdilution or agar dilution method. the ratio of methicillin-resistant strains among staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis was 53.0% and 65.8%, suggesting that resistant strains were isolated  at high frequency. vancomycin (vcm) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (qpr/dpr) had good antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, with mic90s of < or = 2 micrcog/ml. the ratio of penicillin (pc) intermediate and resistant strains classified by mutations of pc-binding proteins among streptococcus pneumoniae was 87.6%. ceftriaxone, cefpirome, cefepime, carbapenem antibiotics, vcm, teicoplanin, linezolid(lzd) and qpr/dpr had mic90s of < or = 1 microg/ml against pc-intermediate and resistant s. pneumoniae strains. against all strains of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, the mics of vcm and teic were under 2 microg/ml, and no resistant strain was detected, suggesting that these agents had excellent activities against these species. 10.9% of e. faecalis strains or 3.5% of e. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to lzd. 24.4% of e. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to qpr/dpr. against  all strains of clostridium difficile, the mic of vcm were under 1 microg/ml, suggesting that vcm had excellent activity against c. difficile. carbapenems showed good activity against peptococcaceae, bacteroides spp., and prevotella spp. however since several strains of bacteroides fragilis showed resistant to carbapenems and the susceptibility of this species should be well-focused in the  future.

TI  == streptococcus
AB  == the genus streptococcus , a heterogeneous group of gram-positive bacteria, has broad significance in medicine and industry. various streptococci are important ecologically as part of the normal microbial flora of animals and humans; some can also cause diseases that range from subacute to acute or even chronic. among  the significant human diseases attributable to streptococci are scarlet fever, rheumatic heart disease, glomerulonephritis, and pneumococcal pneumonia. streptococci are essential in industrial and dairy processes and as indicators of pollution. the nomenclature for streptococci, especially the nomenclature in medical use, has been based largely on serogroup identification of cell wall components rather than on species names. for several decades, interest has focused on two major species that cause severe infections: s pyogenes (group a streptococci) and s pneumoniae (pneumococci). in 1984, two members were assigned  a new genus - the group d enterococcal species (which account for 98% of human enterococcal infections) became enterococcus faecalis (the majority of human clinical isolates) and e faecium (associated with a remarkable capacity for antibiotic resistance). in recent years, increasing attention has been given to other streptococcal species, partly because innovations in serogrouping methods have led to advances in understanding the pathogenetic and epidemiologic significance of these species. a variety of cell-associated and extracellular products are produced by streptococci, but their cause-effect relationship with pathogenesis has not been defined. some of the other medically important streptococci are s agalactiae (group b), an etiologic agent of neonatal disease;  e faecalis (group d), a major cause of endocarditis, and the viridans streptococci. particularly for the viridans streptococci, taxonomy and nomenclature are not yet fully reliable or consistent. important members of the viridans streptococci, normal commensals, include s mutans and s sanguis (involved in dental caries), s mitis (associated with bacteremia, meningitis, periodontal disease and pneumonia), and "s milleri" (associated with suppurative  infections in children and adults). there remains persistent taxonomic confusion  regarding "s milleri." these and other streptococci of medical importance are listed intable 13-1by serogroup designation, normal ecologic niche, and associated disease.

TI  == spectrum of early-onset and late-onset bacteremias after liver transplantation: implications for management.
AB  == bacteremia is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality after liver transplantation. the characterization of the microbiological spectrum of bacteremia after liver transplantation may help physicians in choosing the initial empirical antimicrobial therapy for patients presenting with sepsis. the  clinical and microbiology records of patients who received liver transplantation  from january 1997 to march 2006 were reviewed. one hundred twenty-three of the 737 liver recipients (16.7%) developed bacteremia during the median follow-up period of 5.8 years (interquartile range = 2.5-8.8 years); 92 patients (12.5%) had gram-positive bacteremia (gpb), whereas 47 (6.4%) had gram-negative bacteremia (gnb). nosocomial bacteremia was significantly more frequent among patients with early-onset gpb or gnb versus patients with late-onset gpb (66.7% versus 23.7%, p < 0.001) or gnb (70.6% versus 20.0%, p = 0.001). peritonitis (33.3% versus 7.9%, p = 0.004) and wound infections (13.0% versus 0%, p = 0.04) as sources were more common in patients with early-onset gpb versus patients with late-onset gpb. likewise, peritonitis was a more common source of early-onset gnb than late-onset gnb (41.2% versus 6.7%, p = 0.007). staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium were the most common pathogens in patients with early-onset  gpb, whereas enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus species were most common in  patients with late-onset gpb. pseudomonas aeruginosa and anaerobes were the most  common pathogens in patients with early-onset gnb, whereas escherichia coli was most common in patients with late-onset gnb. in conclusion, the microbiological spectra of early-onset and late-onset bacteremias differ, and this should be considered by those determining the initial empirical treatment of liver transplant recipients suspected to have bacteremias.

TI  == probiotic assessment of enterococcus faecalis cp58 isolated from human gut.
AB  == a total of seventy lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from the faeces of healthy humans and their identities were confirmed by sequencing of their 16s rdna genes. of these only 5 isolates were found to resist bile salts and indicated survival in the simulated in vitro digestion assay which reproduces the stomach and intestinal digestion indicating their tolerance to gastric enzymes and the low ph conditions. species that showed the best resistance to these conditions were: lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus sp., uncultured bifidobacteria, enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus anginosus. these strains  were investigated further to study their capacity to adhere to human intestinal caco-2 cells. e. faecalis was the most adherent strain. examination of the virulence determinants for this strain indicated that it was positive for efaafs, gele, agg, cpd, cob, ccf and cad, a profile that is similar to that of many e. faecalis isolates from food sources. the cytolysin biosynthetic genes cyla, cylb  and cylm that are more associated with the clinical isolates of e. faecium were not detected in this strain. the antibiotic susceptibility tests indicated that the strain was sensitive to vancomycin, tetracycline, rifampicin and erythromycin but resistant only to kanamycin and chloramphenicol. these data suggest that the  strain e. faecalis cp58 may be tested further for beneficial properties and developed as a new probiotic.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic analyses of lactic acid bacteria in local fermented food, breast milk and faeces of mothers and their babies.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are generally accepted as beneficial to the host and their presence is directly influenced by ingestion of fermented food or probiotics. while the intestinal lactic microbiota is well-described knowledge on its routes of inoculation and competitiveness towards selective pressure shaping  the intestinal microbiota is limited. in this study, lab were isolated from faecal samples of breast feeding mothers living in syria, from faeces of their infants, from breast milk as well as from fermented food, typically consumed in syria. a total of 700 isolates were characterized by genetic fingerprinting with  random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) and identified by comparative 16s rdna sequencing and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) analyses. thirty six different species of lactobacillus, enterococcus, streptococcus, weissella and pediococcus were identified. rapd and maldi-tof-ms patterns allowed comparison of the lactic microbiota on species and strain level. whereas some species were unique for one  source, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus brevis were found in all sources. interestingly, identical rapd genotypes of l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis and p. pentosaceus were found in the faeces of mothers, her milk and in faeces of her babies. diversity of rapd types found in food versus human samples suggests the importance of host factors in colonization and individual host specificity, and support the hypothesis that there is a vertical  transfer of intestinal lab from the mother's gut to her milk and through the milk to the infant's gut.

TI  == prevalence of hospital-acquired enterococci infections in two primary-care hospitals in osogbo, southwestern nigeria.
AB  == enterococci are opportunistic bacteria that become pathogenic when they colonize  niches where they are not normally found. of recent, they have become major cause of nosocomial infections, especially of the bloodstream, urinary tract and surgical sites. the aim of this study is to determine the point-prevalence rate of human enterococci infections among hospitalized patients in osogbo, nigeria. the study was conducted between january and june 2009 in two primary-care hospitals in osogbo and involved a total of 118 patients who developed clinical evidence of infection at least 48 hours after hospital admission. appropriate clinical samples were collected from the patients after an informed consent and cultured for isolation/biochemical identification of enterococcus species at the  bacteriology laboratory of ladoke akintola university of technology, osogbo using standard microbiological methods. there were 525 hospital admissions within the time frame of the study of which 118 (22.5%) developed hospital acquired infection (hai); 58 (49.2%) of which cultured positive for bacterial pathogens. enterococci were isolated from infective focus in 7 patients, giving a prevalence rate of hospital-acquired enterococci infection of 5.9%. two species of enterococcus were identified; enterococcus faecalis from urinary tract infection  (uti) and surgical site infection (ssi) of 6 (85.7%) patients and enterococcus faecium from uti in 1 (14.3%) patient. other bacteria recovered from other infective foci were klebsiella spp 31.0%, pseudomonas spp 20.7%, staphylococcus aureus 17.2%, escherichia coli 12.1%, staphylococcus epidermidis 3.4%, streptococcus pneumoniae 1.7% and serratia spp 1.7%. all the enterococci isolates were multiply antibiotic resistant, and 42.9% were vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) with the vre strains showing resistance to wider range of antibiotics than the vancomycin-sensitive strains. other gram-positive and gram negative bacterial isolates also demonstrated multiple resistance to all commonly available antibiotics in this community except e. coli and pseudomonas spp which  were relatively sensitive to ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime. this limited study demonstrated a high prevalence rate of multiple antibiotic resistant enterococci  infections among hospitalized patients in this environment. there is need for systematic surveillance of hospitals for enterococci infections; prudent use and  rational prescription of antibiotics and stringent measures to reduce the prevalence rate by health education on infection control measures such as isolation, cleaning, disinfection and sterilization.

TI  == ftir-based polyphasic identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional greek graviera cheese.
AB  == this study used a combination of phenotypic, physical (fourier transformed infra-red [ftir] spectroscopy) and molecular (rflp and sscp analysis of 16s rrna  genes) methods to identify the lactic acid bacteria (lab) flora present in traditional greek graviera cheese after five weeks of ripening. a total of 300 isolates collected from high dilution plates of tsaye (incubated at 30 degrees c), m-17 (22 degrees c) and m-17 (42 degrees c) agar media were clustered by ftir and then representative strains of each cluster were cross-identified blindly by  all methods. based on their ftir spectra, 282 isolates were lab grouped in 28 clusters. the lab species identified and their prevalence in the cheese samples were: lactobacillus casei/paracasei (68.8%), lactobacillus plantarum (19.5%), streptococcus thermophilus (8.9%), enterococcus faecium (2.1%), and lactococcus lactis (0.7%). also, staphylococcus equorum (11 isolates), corynebacterium sp. (5 isolates) and brevibacterium sp. (1 isolate) were recovered from tsaye. comparative identification results showed that phenotypic and molecular methods were in mutual agreement as regards the lab species identified. the present polyphasic identification approach based on rapid ftir screening of 10-fold more  isolates than a previous classical identification approach allowed or improved detection of few sub-dominant species; however the predominant lab species in the cheese samples were the same with both approaches.

AB  == objectives: the antimicrobial activity of telavancin against 2279 clinical gram-positive cocci obtained from patients with nosocomial pneumonia [np; including those with ventilator-acquired pneumonia (vap)] located in numerous medical centres worldwide was evaluated. methods: a contemporary collection of 2279 non-duplicate consecutive gram-positive clinical isolates were submitted from 87 hospitals located in north america (913 isolates), latin america (222 isolates), europe (690 isolates), and the asia-pacific region (454 isolates) as part of the international telavancin surveillance programme for 2007-08. isolates were tested for susceptibility by the reference broth microdilution method (with  2%-5% lysed horse blood added for testing of streptococci). interpretive criteria were those from clsi (m100-s20, 2010) except for telavancin, for which the susceptible breakpoints approved by the us fda were applied. results: telavancin  was highly active against staphylococcus aureus (mic(90), 0.25 mg/l; 100% susceptible), coagulase-negative staphylococci (mic(90), 0.25 mg/l), streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), 0.03 mg/l), viridans group streptococci (mic(90), 0.06 mg/l; 100% susceptible), beta-haemolytic streptococci (mic(90), 0.06 mg/l; 100% susceptible) and vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (mic(90), 0.5 mg/l; 100% susceptible). telavancin inhibited all staphylococci at </= 0.5 mg/l.  among enterococci non-susceptible to vancomycin (all enterococcus faecium), telavancin was active against isolates exhibiting a vanb phenotype (mic, 0.06-0.12 mg/l), but less potent against vana strains (mic, >/= 2 mg/l). conclusions: telavancin demonstrated equal or greater potency than the comparators (vancomycin, teicoplanin, daptomycin, linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin) against gram-positive pathogens implicated in np. telavancin showed elevated mic values only against enterococcus isolates showing  a vana phenotype. the continued appearance of multidrug-resistant pathogens among gram-positive isolates, mainly s. aureus, necessitates the introduction of new agents and longitudinal surveillance to monitor for the potential emergence of resistance.

TI  == bactericidal effects of non-thermal argon plasma in vitro, in biofilms and in the animal model of infected wounds.
AB  == non-thermal (low-temperature) physical plasma is under intensive study as an alternative approach to control superficial wound and skin infections when the effectiveness of chemical agents is weak due to natural pathogen or biofilm resistance. the purpose of this study was to test the individual susceptibility of pathogenic bacteria to non-thermal argon plasma and to measure the effectiveness of plasma treatments against bacteria in biofilms and on wound surfaces. overall, gram-negative bacteria were more susceptible to plasma treatment than gram-positive bacteria. for the gram-negative bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cenocepacia and escherichia coli, there were no survivors among the initial 10(5) c.f.u. after a 5 min plasma treatment. the susceptibility of gram-positive bacteria was species- and strain-specific. streptococcus pyogenes was the most resistant with 17 % survival of the initial 10(5) c.f.u. after a 5 min plasma treatment. staphylococcus aureus had a strain-dependent resistance with 0 and 10 % survival from 10(5) c.f.u. of the sa  78 and atcc 6538 strains, respectively. staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecium had medium resistance. non-ionized argon gas was not bactericidal. biofilms partly protected bacteria, with the efficiency of protection dependent on biofilm thickness. bacteria in deeper biofilm layers survived better after the plasma treatment. a rat model of a superficial slash wound infected with p. aeruginosa and the plasma-sensitive staphylococcus aureus  strain sa 78 was used to assess the efficiency of argon plasma treatment. a 10 min treatment significantly reduced bacterial loads on the wound surface. a 5-day course of daily plasma treatments eliminated p. aeruginosa from the plasma-treated animals 2 days earlier than from the control ones. a statistically significant increase in the rate of wound closure was observed in plasma-treated  animals after the third day of the course. wound healing in plasma-treated animals slowed down after the course had been completed. overall, the results show considerable potential for non-thermal argon plasma in eliminating pathogenic bacteria from biofilms and wound surfaces.

TI  == microbial stability and safety of traditional greek graviera cheese: characterization of the lactic acid bacterial flora and culture-independent detection of bacteriocin genes in the ripened cheeses and their microbial consortia.
AB  == the microflora of four batches of traditional greek graviera cheese was studied at 5 weeks of ripening, and 200 lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolates were phenotypically characterized and screened for antilisterial bacteriocins. the cheeses were also analyzed for organic acids by high-performance liquid chromatography and for the potential presence of 25 known lab bacteriocin genes directly in cheese and their microbial consortia by pcr. all batches were safe according to the european union regulatory criteria for listeria monocytogenes, salmonella, enterobacteria, and coagulase-positive staphylococci. the cheese flora was dominated by nonstarter lactobacillus casei/paracasei (67.5%) and lactobacillus plantarum (16.3%) strains, whereas few streptococcus thermophilus (3.8%), lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (0.6%), and leuconostoc (1.9%) organisms were present. enterococcus faecium (9.4%) and enterococcus durans (0.6%) were isolated among the dominant lab from two batches; however, enterococci were present in all batches at 10- to 100-fold lower populations than mesophilic lactobacilli. sixteen e. faecium isolates produced antilisterial enterocins. in accordance, enterocin b gene was detectable in all cheeses and enterocin p gene was present in one cheese, whereas the consortia of all cheeses contained at least two of the enterocin a, b, p, 31, l50a, and l50b genes. plantaricin a gene  was also amplified from all cheeses. mean concentrations of lactic, acetic, citric, and propionic acids in the ripened cheeses exceeded 1.5% in total, of which approximately 0.9% was lactate. thus, organic acid contents constitute an important hurdle factor for inhibiting growth of pathogens in traditional graviera cheese products, with lab bacteriocins, mainly enterocins, potentially contributing to increased cheese safety.

AB  == an analytical system based on rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) for enumeration of catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci was established. subgroup- or species-specific primer sets targeting 16s or 23s rrna  from enterococcus, streptococcus, and lactococcus were newly developed. the rt-qpcr method using these primers together with the previously reported primer sets specific for the enterococcus genus, the streptococcus genus, and several streptococcus species was found to be able to quantify the target populations with detection limits of 10(3) to 10(4) cells per gram feces, which was more than 100 times as sensitive as the qpcr method (10(6) to 10(8) cells per gram feces).  the rt-qpcr analysis of fecal samples from 24 healthy adult volunteers using the  genus-specific primer sets revealed that enterococcus and streptococcus were present as intestinal commensals at population levels of log(10) 6.2 +/- 1.4 and  7.5 +/- 0.9 per gram feces (mean +/- standard deviation [sd]), respectively. detailed investigation using species- or subgroup-specific primer sets revealed that the volunteers harbored unique enterococcus species, including the e. avium  subgroup, the e. faecium subgroup, e. faecalis, the e. casseliflavus subgroup, and e. caccae, while the dominant human intestinal streptococcus species was found to be s. salivarius. various lactococcus species, such as l. lactis subsp.  lactis or l. lactis subsp. cremoris, l. garvieae, l. piscium, and l. plantarum, were also detected but at a lower population level (log(10) 4.6 +/- 1.2 per gram  feces) and prevalence (33%). these results suggest that the rt-qpcr method enables the accurate and sensitive enumeration of human intestinal subdominant but still important populations, such as gram-positive cocci.

TI  == [interpretive reading of the antibiogram in gram positive cocci].
AB  == resistance to methicillin in staphylococcus is related to the expression of the meca gene, and involves resistance to all beta-lactams, with the exception of the new cephalosporins, ceftobiprole and ceftaroline. breakpoints for interpretation  of this mechanism differ in s. aureus and in coagulase-negative species. for macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramins b, (mls(b)) the most frequent mechanism among resistant strains is expression of methylases (erm genes). topoisomerase changes caused by point mutations and expression of the efflux pump nora determine resistance to quinolones, but there are great differences in the activity of different compounds, which makes interpretative reading difficult. strains of s. aureus with intermediate susceptibility to glycopeptides (gisa strains) have been described, as well as highly-vancomycin-resistant isolates (vana isolates). in spain, there is a high percentage of s. pneumoniae strains intermediate or resistant to penicillin, and a low percentage of strains intermediate or resistant to third generation cephalosporins, due to mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. the most frequent phenotype of resistance to mls(b) in this species is caused by methylase production. resistance to quinolones is still uncommon, and is mainly related to mutations in parc/pare (low level) and in gyra. it is important to detect low level resistance due to its clinical implications. no strains of s. pyogenes resistant to penicillin have yet been described. in spain the most common phenotype of resistance to macrolides in s. pyogenes is determined by efflux pumps (mef genes), affecting 14- and 15-membered macrolides. e. faecalis is usually susceptible to ampicillin, in contrast to e. faecium. enterococci show intrinsic  low-level resistance to aminoglycosides, but still remain susceptible to the combination of these antimicrobials and cell-wall active agents. strains expressing different aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (high-level resistance) became resistant to the combination. glycopeptide-resistant strains of enterococci are uncommon in spain, but nosocomial outbreaks due to vana enterococci and case reports due to vanb2 enterococci have been recently reported.

TI  == antibiotic resistance of probiotic strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from  marketed foods and drugs.
AB  == objective: to identify the antimicrobial resistance of commercial lactic acid bacteria present in microbial foods and drug additives by analyzing their isolated strains used for fermentation and probiotics. methods: antimicrobial susceptibility of 41 screened isolates was tested with disc diffusion and e-test  methods after species-level identification. resistant strains were selected and examined for the presence of resistance genes by pcr. results: distribution of resistance was found in different species. all isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cephalothin, and imipenem. in addition, isolates resistant to vancomycin, rifampicin, streptomycin, bacitracin, and erythromycin were detected, although the incidence of resistance to these antibiotics was relatively low. in contrast, most strains were resistant to ciprofloxacin, amikacin, trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole, and gentamycin. the genes msrc, vanx, and dfra were detected in strains of enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus thermophilus, and lactococcus lactis. conclusion: antibiotic resistance is present in different species of probiotic strains, which poses a threat to food safety. evaluation of the safety of lactic acid bacteria for human consumption should be guided by established criteria, guidelines and regulations.

TI  == nxl-103, a combination of flopristin and linopristin, for the potential treatment of bacterial infections including community-acquired pneumonia and mrsa.
AB  == novexel is developing the novel, orally active, semisynthetic streptogramin nxl-103, which has potential therapeutic application in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, community- or hospital-acquired mrsa, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, and acute bacterial skin and soft tissue infections. nxl-103 is a combination of streptogramin a:streptogramin b components, initially developed in a 70:30 dose ratio. in multiple in vitro studies, nxl-103 demonstrated potent activity against different types of bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis,  haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae. nxl-103 was not affected by the resistance profiles of bacteria against other commonly used antibiotics. in phase i clinical trials, nxl-103 achieved bactericidal levels in plasma and was generally well tolerated, with side effects primarily on the gastrointestinal system. the first phase ii trial conducted to evaluate the efficacy of nxl-103 against community-acquired pneumonia revealed that the compound was comparable with amoxicillin. nxl-103 has promise to become an important agent in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and complex skin and soft tissue infections, pending further development.

TI  == speciation of gram-positive bacteria in fresh and ambient-stored sub-tropical marine fish.
AB  == this study identified gram-positive bacteria in three sub-tropical marine fish species; pseudocaranx dentex (silver trevally), pagrus auratus (snapper) and mugil cephalus (sea mullet). it further elucidated the role played by fish habitat, fish body part and ambient storage on the composition of the gram-positive bacteria. a total of 266 isolates of gram-positive bacteria were identified by conventional biochemical methods, vitek, pcr using genus- and species-specific primers and/or 16s rrna gene sequencing. the isolates were found to fall into 13 genera and 30 species. in fresh fish, staphylococcus epidermidis  and micrococcus luteus were the most frequent isolates. after ambient storage, s. epidermidis, s. xylosus and bacillus megaterium were no longer present whereas s. warneri, b. sphaericus, brevibacillus borstelensis, enterococcus faecium and streptococcus uberis increased in frequency. micrococcus luteus and s. warneri were the most prevalent isolates from p. dentex, while e. faecium and strep. uberis were the most frequent isolates from p. auratus and m. cephalus. with respect to different parts of the fish body, e. faecium, strep. uberis and b. sphaericus were the most frequent isolates from the muscles, e. faecium, strep. uberis from the gills and m. luteus from the gut. this study showed a diversity of gram-positive bacteria in sub-tropical marine fish; however, their abundance was affected by fish habitat, fish body part and ambient storage.

TI  == susceptibility to tigecycline of isolates from samples collected in hospitalized  patients with secondary peritonitis undergoing surgery.
AB  == activity of tigecycline against nosocomial secondary peritonitis isolates collected along 18 months in 29 spanish hospitals was tested by etest in a central laboratory, considering food and drug administration (fda)/british society for antimicrobial chemotherapy (bsac)/european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) breakpoints. a total of 600 facultative/aerobic isolates (392 gram negative, 208 gram positive) and 100 anaerobes were tested. none of the 220 escherichia coli isolates was resistant to tigecycline (mic(50)/mic(90) = 0.25/0.5 microg/ml), with 0.5% (fda breakpoint) and 3.6% (bsac/eucast breakpoint) intermediate strains. all extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing e. coli isolates (15 strains), all klebsiella pneumoniae, and klebsiella oxytoca isolates (42 strains) were susceptible to tigecycline. no isolates resistant to tigecycline were found among streptococcus  viridans, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecium, but 18.9% of enterococcus faecalis strains were intermediate following bsac/eucast breakpoints. all (but 1) isolates of the bacteroides fragilis group (n = 45) were tigecycline susceptible, as well as gram-positive anaerobes. tigecycline offers an adequate activity profile against isolates from secondary peritonitis when tested by etest regardless of the breakpoints used for categorization.

TI  == new antibiotics: optimal use in current clinical practice.
AB  == the optimal choice of antibacterial therapy among the few available options for infections caused by pathogens with advanced antimicrobial drug resistance is fundamental to maximize clinical effectiveness and minimize the likelihood for further resistance development. we herein review the available data on the effectiveness of antibiotics introduced in clinical practice during the past 10 years for specific clinical indications. quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, daptomycin and tigecycline have increased the available therapeutic options against specific types of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium infections. the newer fluoroquinolones, moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin, along with the ketolide telithromycin and the oral third-generation cephalosporin cefditoren are particularly valuable for the treatment of specific types of multidrug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae infections. tigecycline appears as a promising therapeutic option for infections  caused by enterobacteriaceae producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), or multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii. ertapenem and doripenem may be particularly useful against infections caused by esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae and multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively.

TI  == [update on antimicrobial chemotherapy].
AB  == there is a constant need for new antibacterial agents because of the unavoidable  development of bacterial resistance that follows the introduction of antibiotics  in clinical practice. as observed in many fields, innovation generally comes by series. for instance, a wide variety of broad-spectrum antibacterial agents became available between the 1970s and the 1990s, such as cephalosporins, penicillin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, carbapenems, and fluoroquinolones. over the last 2 decades, the arrival of new antibacterial drugs on the market has dramatically slowed, leaving a frequent gap between isolation of resistant pathogens and effective treatment options. in fact, many pharmaceutical companies focused on the development of narrow-spectrum antibiotics targeted at multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria (e.g. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, penicillin resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium). therefore, multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria (e.g. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii) recently emerged and rapidly spread worldwide. even if some molecules were developed, new molecules for infections caused by these multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria remain remarkably scarce compared to those for gram-positive infections. this review summarises the major microbiological, pharmacological, and clinical properties of systemic antibiotics recently marketed in france (i.e. linezolid, daptomycin, tigecycline, ertapenem, and doripenem) as well as those of antibacterial drugs currently in development (i.e. ceftobiprole, ceftaroline, dalbavancin, telavancin, oritavancin, iclaprim, and ramoplanin) or available in other countries (i.e. garenoxacin, sitafloxacin, and temocillin).

TI  == zyvox annual appraisal of potency and spectrum program: linezolid surveillance program results for 2008.
AB  == the seventh year of the zyvox annual appraisal of potency and spectrum program (2008) continues to monitor the in vitro activities of linezolid and comparator agents tested against gram-positive pathogens in latin america, europe, canada, and the asia-pacific region. linezolid is an oxazolidinone approved for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium infections, complicated skin and soft tissue infections, and nosocomial pneumonia caused by various gram-positive species including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). surveillance isolates were submitted from 64 medical centers (24 countries) for a total of 6121 strains. each country was requested to send 200 consecutive isolates in 6 targeted pathogen categories to a central processing laboratory, except the united kingdom, japan, and china where more strains were processed (400, 400, and 800, respectively). reference broth microdilution susceptibility testing methods were used to test the following organism groups: s. aureus (3240), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (748), enterococci (864), streptococcus pneumoniae (655), viridans group (297), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (317). eight linezolid-resistant (lzd-r) isolates were detected in 7 countries (italy [2], france, china, brazil, sweden, germany, and united kingdom) among the enterococci (enterococcus faecalis [3] and e. faecium [2]) and cons (3  staphylococcus epidermidis). five lzd-r isolates contained 23s rrna mutations (g2576t or g2447t), and 2 strains had undeterminable resistance mechanisms. one cons (italy) contained the mobile cfr gene. vancomycin-resistant enterococci rates ranged from 0.0% in several countries to 59.4% in taiwan. all streptococci  were linezolid susceptible (mic(90), 1 microg/ml). in conclusion, the activity of linezolid remained uniform and stable across the sampled geographic regions studied when compared to the 2006 to 2007 results. documented lzd-r remains rare  (only 0.13% overall but highest for cons [0.41%] and enterococci [0.69%]) among the 24 countries sampled for the 6 different pathogen groups. rates of clindamycin resistance and the frequency of mrsa varied by geographic region and  between nations; therefore, like oxazolidinones, it requires continued surveillance for changing resistance patterns.

TI  == linezolid surveillance program results for 2008 (leader program for 2008).
AB  == the leader program was initiated in 2004 and monitors emerging linezolid resistance in sampled us medical centers. this report summarizes the data obtained in 2008, the 5th consecutive year. a total of 57 institutions participated in 2008 representing all 9 us census regions with 100 target organisms per site (6113 isolates, 101.9% compliance to protocol design). the organisms tested by reference broth microdilution methods were staphylococcus aureus (3156), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons; 856), enterococci (901), streptococcus pneumoniae (619), and viridans group (223) or beta-hemolytic streptococci (358); also, d-test was used to determine inducible clindamycin resistance in staphylococcus aureus. linezolid remained very potent against all sampled species with mic(90) results ranging from 1 microg/ml (streptococci and cons) to 2 microg/ml (staphylococcus aureus and enterococci). only 0.36% of sampled strains were nonsusceptible to linezolid, a slight decrease from 0.45% and 0.44% in 2006 and 2007, respectively. the nonsusceptible strains (22) were staphylococcus aureus (3), cons (14), and enterococcus faecium (5) each with defined target mutations (g2576t in 19 strains; t2504a in 1 strain), mobile cfr element (1 strain staphylococcus epidermidis with an identical pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern to a cfr-positive staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from the same center in leader 2007), or an unknown (1 strain) mechanism. the mobile cfr resistance found in a staphylococcus aureus strain in 2007 was not observed in 2008. in conclusion, linezolid activity sampled by the 5th year of this leader program showed sustained potency and spectrum (99.64% susceptibility  levels). the nonsusceptible strain isolation rates remained stable and the plasmid-mediated ribosomal-based resistance mechanism that emerged in staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis strains in 2007 showed no evidence of dissemination or increased prevalence. however, there was evidence of cfr persistence with the s. epidermidis strain. the leader program continues to be an effective and sensitive surveillance tool to detect and monitor novel oxazolidinone resistance phenotypes and genotypes.

TI  == inhibiting effects of enterococcus faecium non-biofilm strain on streptococcus mutans biofilm formation.
AB  == background and purpose: enterococcus faecium is a normal bowel commensal and lactic acid bacterium that is rarely found in the oral cavity. this study investigated whether a non-pathogenic and non-biofilm strain of e. faecium functioned as a probiotic strain toward biofilm formation by streptococcus mutans, which is an etiological agent for dental caries. methods: the effects of  e. faecium on streptococcal biofilm was evaluated by absorbance of safranin-stained biofilm at 492 nm in a 96-well microtiter plate. results: the e. faecium strain demonstrated cell-number-dependent inhibition of biofilm in dual cultures with 4 laboratory and 16 clinical s. mutans strains, as well as laboratory strains of streptococcus sobrinus and streptococcus sanguinis, in 96-well microtiter plates. the inhibiting effects of e. faecium were not dependent on the production of bacteriocin from streptococci and e. faecium, low  ph after mix culture, or biofilm formation levels of s. mutans. a culture supernatant sample of more than 10 kda from e. faecium showed direct inhibiting effects toward s. mutans biofilm formation. treatment of heat, butanol, and phenol to a supernatant sample restored biofilm formation in culture of s. mutans with the sample. moreover, the tendencies of inhibition levels by the supernatant sample were associated with those by bacterial cells of e. faecium to s. mutans strains. conclusions: the e. faecium non-biofilm strain produced an inhibiting protein to streptococci biofilm formation, showed various susceptibilities to inhibit streptococcal biofilm, and acted as a probiotic bacterial inhibitor of streptococcal biofilm formation.

TI  == main microorganisms involved in the fermentation of ugandan ghee.
AB  == ghee is widely produced from a traditional fermented butter-like product named mashita in western uganda. however, no detailed studies have been done to identify the microorganisms involved in mashita fermentation. the aim of this study was to identify the microorganisms present at the end of mashita ripening using culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. the most commonly identified species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in mashita using culture-dependent techniques were lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus perolens constituting 37.3%, 10.1%, 8.1% and 7.7% of total bacterial colonies isolated respectively. l. paracasei was the only bacterial species identified in all mashita samples by culture-dependent technique. two of the four most commonly isolated lab species (l. helveticus and l. plantarum) were also identified in mashita by a culture-independent method (pcr-dgge). other main lab species identified in mashita by pcr-dgge were bifidobacterium sp., enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus acetotolerans, lactobacillus sp., lactococcus raffinolactis, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and streptococcus salivarius. the main species of acetic acid bacteria (aab) identified in the mashita using pcr-dgge method were acetobacter aceti, acetobacter lovaniensis, acetobacter orientalis and acetobacter pasteurianus. pcr-dgge identification of yeasts showed that brettanomyces custersianus, candida silvae, geotrichum sp., issatchenkia occidentalis, issatchenkia orientalis, kluyveromyces marxianus, saccharomyces cerevisiae, and trichosporon asahii were main yeast species in mashita. a. lovaniensis, a. aceti, and i. orientalis were identified in all the six mashita samples analyzed using pcr-dgge method. other microbial species were only found in some samples. these results indicate that lab and yeasts, as in similar fermentation products, but also aab are main microbial groups involved in mashita fermentation.

AB  == racemic 2,4-diaminopyrimidine dihydrophthalazine derivatives bal0030543, bal0030544, and bal0030545 exhibited low in vitro mics toward small, selected panels of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae,  moraxella catarrhalis, and mycobacterium avium, though the compounds were less active against haemophilus influenzae. the constellation of dihydrofolate reductases (dhfrs) present in 20 enterococci and 40 staphylococci was analyzed and correlated with the antibacterial activities of the dihydrophthalazines and trimethoprim. dhfrs encoded by dfrb, dfra (s1 isozyme), dfre, and fola were susceptible to the dihydrophthalazines, whereas dhfrs encoded by dfrg (s3 isozyme) and dfrf were not. studies with the separated enantiomers of bal0030543, bal0030544, and bal0030545 revealed preferential inhibition of susceptible dhfrs  by the (r)-enantiomers. bal0030543, bal0030544, and bal0030545 were well tolerated by mice during 5- and 10-day oral toxicity studies at doses of up to 400 mg/kg of body weight. using a nonoptimized formulation, the dihydrophthalazines displayed acceptable oral bioavailabilities in mice, and efficacy studies with a septicemia model of mice infected with trimethoprim-resistant, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus gave 50% effective dose values in the range of 1.6 to 6.25 mg/kg.

TI  == bacterial diversity of darfiyeh, a lebanese artisanal raw goat's milk cheese.
AB  == in order to contribute to the preservation of the lebanese dairy heritage, the aim of this study was to characterize the darfiyeh cheese, a traditional variety  made from raw goat's milk and ripened in goat's skin. three independent batches of darfiyeh production were analyzed after 20, 40 and 60 days of ripening. mesophilic lactobacilli, thermophilic coccal-shaped lactic acid bacteria (lab) and thermophilic lactobacilli were enumerated. in order to explore the darfiyeh natural ecosystem, a combination of phenotypical and molecular approaches was applied. the latter included polymerase chain reaction-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (pcr-ttge), classical pcr and quantitative pcr. these methods revealed the presence of streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus malodoratus, group d streptococcus sp., lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and l. lactis subsp. cremoris, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus curvatus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, escherichia coli, clostridium sp./eubacterium tenue. real-time pcr  enabled quantification of e. faecium, with a detection of 10(7)-10(9) cfu g(-1) of product. the present molecular approaches combined with phenotypic method allowed describing the complex natural ecosystem of darfiyeh, giving useful information for the preservation of lebanese artisanal dairy products.

TI  == assessment of the in vitro efficacy of the novel antimicrobial peptide cect7121 against human gram-positive bacteria from serious infections refractory to treatment.
AB  == background: resistant gram-positive bacteria are causing increasing concern in clinical practice. this work investigated the efficacy of ap-cect7121 (an antimicrobial peptide isolated from an environmental strain of enterococcus faecalis cect7121) against various pathogenic gram-positive bacteria. methods: strains were isolated from intensive care unit patients unresponsive to standard  antibiotic treatments. inhibitory activity of ap-cect7121 was assessed using the  agar-well diffusion method. the most resistant isolates from each species screened (enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis,staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, clostridium perfringens and clostridium difficile) were further examined in time-killing curve studies. results: these bactericidal kinetic experiments demonstrated a rapid killing effect with no viable bacteria being detected within 30 and 90 min for enterococcal and streptococcal strains and 180 min for community-acquired methicillin-resistant s. aureus and c. perfringens: viable counts for c. difficile were threefold decreased after 90 min. conclusions: ap-cect7121 may provide a novel strategy for treating potentially fatal clinical infections in hospitalized patients.

TI  == characterisation of thermotolerant cocci from indigenous flora of 'leben' in algerian arid area and dna identification of atypical lactococcus lactis strains.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are widely used in food industry and their growth performance is important for the quality of the fermented product. by combining results from conventional isolation methods and molecular investigation of 16s rrna gene and lactococcal/enterococcal specific genes, we identify at species level catalase negative gram positive thermoresistant cocci isolated from traditional 'leben', a 24-h fermented milk in arid area of west algeria. forty strains phenotypically related to cocci lab were identified as belonging to the species lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and other enterococcus species. no streptococcus thermophilus strain was isolated. ten different phenotype groups were recognized, and the species content of these groups were in some cases different from the expected features usually given in genus and species descriptions. in particular, atypical lactococci, able to grow in 6.5% nacl, at ph 9.5 and showing high resistance to thermal stresses were isolated. lactococci, but also enterococci isolated from traditional 'leben' produced in the desert area, may be therefore of interest in milk fermentation. further studies to assess this source of diversity within the wild microbial population should provide starter new strains for product innovation.

TI  == prevalence of resistance phenotypes and genotypes to macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin antibiotics in gram-positive cocci isolated in tunisian bone marrow transplant center.
AB  == to investigate the prevalence of resistance to macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin (mls) antibiotics in gram-positive cocci isolated in a bone marrow  transplant center of tunisia, we tested the antibiotic susceptibility of 172 clinical isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis and enterococcus faecium to macrolide erythromycin and spiramycin, the lincosamide clindamycin and the streptogramin pristinamycin. these three groups of organisms  were mostly resistant to macrolides and lincosamide, but were commonly susceptible to pristinamycin. the resistance phenotypes of erythromycin-resistant isolates were determined by the five-disc test with erythromycin, spiramycin, lincomycin, clindamycin and pristinamycin, which showed that most exhibited constitutive mls resistance. in order to determine the prevalence of the resistance genotypes and the resistance mechanisms, the prevalence of the erythromycin resistance methylase (erm) (a), erm(b), erm(c), msr(a) and macrolide efflux (mef) (a) genes in the erythromycin-resistant isolates was identified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analysis. the resistance was due mainly to the presence of ermb in e. faecium (80%), ermc in s. epidermidis (53%) and mefa in s. mitis (65%).

TI  == global optimal eburst analysis of multilocus typing data using a graphic matroid  approach.
AB  == background: multilocus sequence typing (mlst) is a frequently used typing method  for the analysis of the clonal relationships among strains of several clinically  relevant microbial species. mlst is based on the sequence of housekeeping genes that result in each strain having a distinct numerical allelic profile, which is  abbreviated to a unique identifier: the sequence type (st). the relatedness between two strains can then be inferred by the differences between allelic profiles. for a more comprehensive analysis of the possible patterns of evolutionary descent, a set of rules were proposed and implemented in the eburst  algorithm. these rules allow the division of a data set into several clusters of  related strains, dubbed clonal complexes, by implementing a simple model of clonal expansion and diversification. within each clonal complex, the rules identify which links between sts correspond to the most probable pattern of descent. however, the eburst algorithm is not globally optimized, which can result in links, within the clonal complexes, that violate the rules proposed. results: here, we present a globally optimized implementation of the eburst algorithm - goeburst. the search for a global optimal solution led to the formalization of the problem as a graphic matroid, for which greedy algorithms that provide an optimal solution exist. several public data sets of mlst data were tested and differences between the two implementations were found and are discussed for five bacterial species: enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, burkholderia pseudomallei, campylobacter jejuni and neisseria spp.. a novel feature implemented in goeburst is the representation of the level of tiebreak rule reached before deciding if a link should be drawn, which can used to visually evaluate the reliability of the represented hypothetical pattern of descent. conclusion: goeburst is a globally optimized implementation of the eburst algorithm, that identifies alternative patterns of descent for several bacterial species. furthermore, the algorithm can be applied to any multilocus typing data based on the number of differences between numeric profiles. a software implementation is available at http://goeburst.phyloviz.net.

TI  == ceftaroline: a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == ceftaroline is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections (csssi), including those caused by meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and community-acquired pneumonia (cap). ceftaroline has the ability to bind to penicillin-binding protein (pbp)2a, an mrsa-specific pbp that has low affinity for most other beta-lactam antibacterials. the high binding affinity of  ceftaroline to pbp2a (median inhibitory concentration 0.90 microg/ml) correlates  well with its low minimum inhibitory concentration for mrsa. ceftaroline is active in vitro against gram-positive cocci, including mrsa, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (not e. faecium). the broad-spectrum activity of ceftaroline includes many gram-negative pathogens but does not extend to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing or ampc-derepressed enterobacteriaceae or most nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli. ceftaroline demonstrates limited activity against anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis and  non-fragilis bacteroides spp. limited data show that ceftaroline has a low propensity to select for resistant subpopulations. ceftaroline fosamil (prodrug)  is rapidly converted by plasma phosphatases to active ceftaroline. for multiple intravenous doses of 600 mg given over 1 h every 12 hours for 14 days, the maximum plasma concentration was 19.0 microg/ml and 21.0 microg/ml for first and  last dose, respectively. ceftaroline has a volume of distribution of 0.37 l/kg (28.3 l), low protein binding (<20%) and a serum half-life of 2.6 hours. no drug  accumulation occurs with multiple doses and elimination occurs primarily through  renal excretion (49.6%). based on monte carlo simulations, dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/min); no adjustment is needed for mild renal impairment. currently, limited clinical trial data are available for ceftaroline. a phase ii study randomized 100 patients with csssi to intravenous ceftaroline 600 mg every 12 hours or intravenous vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours with or without intravenous aztreonam 1 g every 8 hours (standard therapy) for 7-14 days. clinical cure rates were 96.7% for ceftaroline compared with 88.9% for standard therapy. adverse events were similar between groups and generally mild in nature. in a phase iii trial, 702 patients with csssi were randomized to ceftaroline 600 mg or vancomycin 1 g plus aztreonam 1 g, each administered intravenously every 12 hours for 5-14 days. ceftaroline was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam in treating csssi caused by both gram-positive and -negative pathogens. adverse event rates were similar between groups. ceftaroline is well tolerated, which is  consistent with the good safety and tolerability profile of the cephalosporin class. in summary, ceftaroline is a promising treatment for csssi and cap, and has potential to be used as monotherapy for polymicrobial infections because of its broad-spectrum activity. further clinical studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of ceftaroline, and to define its role in patient care.

TI  == ceftobiprole: first cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == ceftobiprole medocaril is the first member of a new series of advanced cephalosporins with activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  (mrsa). the drug received an approvable letter from the united states food and drug administration (fda) in march 2008 and from health canada in june 2008 for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections including diabetic foot infections. ceftobiprole exerts its antibacterial activity by inhibiting the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) involved in cell wall synthesis. it has an established stability against hydrolysis by many gram-positive beta-lactamases and a higher affinity for various pbps (such as pbp2a of mrsa or pbp2x of streptococcus pneumoniae), which leads to a wider spectrum of activity compared with older beta-lactams. ceftobiprole activity does not cover extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae and some  other pathogens, including enterococcus faecium or acinetobacter baumanii. generally well tolerated, with nausea and taste disturbance being the most common adverse events, ceftobiprole appeared noninferior to empiric therapy in several clinical trials. ceftobiprole is available only for intravenous administration; recommended dosage regimens have not been approved by the fda as of this writing. however, based on the canadian package insert, expected dosage recommendations are 500 mg as a 1-hour intravenous infusion every 12 hours for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections caused by certain gram-positive pathogens, and 500 mg as a 2-hour infusion every 8 hours when susceptible gram-negative or both gram-positive and susceptible gram-negative pathogens are involved. dosage adjustments are indicated for patients with moderate or severe renal impairment, and dosage recommendations are expected to be 500 or 250 mg, respectively, as a 2-hour infusion every 12 hours. several precautions regarding  hypersensitivity and drug incompatibility are reported. ceftobiprole represents a promising option for the treatment of mono- and polymicrobial infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-positive and susceptible gram-negative pathogens, but further toxicity and safety studies are warranted.

TI  == association of streptococcus pluranimalium with valvular endocarditis and septicaemia in adult broiler parents.
AB  == the genus streptococcus consists of more than 60 species, but only streptococcus  equi subspecies zooepidemicus, streptococcus gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus, streptococcus gallinaceus, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus suis have been isolated from poultry. during investigations of the  aetiology of increased mortality in broiler parent stock at the end of production, pure cultures of streptococcal-like organisms that could not be classified among these six species were obtained from 24 cases of septicaemia or  valvular endocarditis and septicaemia. phenotypic characterization using the api20 strep kit identified the isolates as aerococcus viridans (10), aerococcus urinae (2), leuconostoc species (4), streptococcus salivarius (2), streptococcus  bovis ii 3 (1), enterococcus avium (3), enterococcus faecium (1) or gemella morbillorum (1). however, this identification was misleading as subsequent genetic investigations using pulse field gel electrophoresis and sequencing of 16s rrna genes showed that 19 isolates were classified as streptococcus pluranimalium, while the remaining isolates were e. avium (3), e. faecium (1) or  lactobacillus species (1). misidentification by api20 strep was related to the database provided by the manufacturer, as the phenotypic characteristics could identify these organisms as s. pluranimalium. the isolates of s. pluranimalium belonged to at least three different clones as determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis of smai-digested genomic dna. the capacity that these isolates had to colonize the valvular endothelium was suggested by the occurrence of valvular endocarditis in 12 of 19 cases. demonstration of the same clone in all four houses on a farm suggested the pathogenic potential of this organism.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of doripenem tested against prevalent gram-positive pathogens: results from a global surveillance study (2003-2007).
AB  == doripenem is a broad-spectrum parenteral carbapenem recently approved in the united states for treatment of complicated urinary tract and intra-abdominal infections. although pronounced doripenem antimicrobial activity against various  gram-negative pathogens, including anaerobes, has been confirmed, limited information has been forthcoming on the activity of this agent against leading gram-positive species. we evaluated the activity of doripenem using reference broth microdilution procedures against a large collection of staphylococci, enterococci, and streptococci collected as part of a global (north america, 43.0%; latin america, 11.7%; europe, 31.3%; and asia-pacific, 14.0%) doripenem surveillance program for the years 2003 to 2007. doripenem was confirmed to be highly active against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (22 389 isolates) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (2444 isolates; mic(90) values, <or=0.06 microg/ml), with no differences noted between geographic regions. against enterococcus faecalis (8714 isolates), doripenem displayed modest activity (mic(50), 4 microg/ml) but was largely inactive against enterococcus faecium (4233 isolates). although not currently approved for treatment of respiratory tract infections in the united states, doripenem was highly active against streptococcus pneumoniae (10 260 isolates; mic(90), 0.5 microg/ml) and 2-fold more active than either ceftriaxone or cefepime. doripenem activity was even more noteworthy against beta-hemolytic streptococci (4598 isolates; mic(90), <or=0.06 microg/ml, similar to that of penicillin) and viridans group streptococci (1887 isolates; mic(90), 0.25 microg/ml). doripenem appears broadly  active in vitro against gram-positive pathogens, a potency similar to that of other carbapenems, a distinct advantage that complements other attributes including beta-lactamase and dehydropeptidase stability and activity against emerging multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogens.

AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to characterize the antimicrobial profile of rep3123, a novel inhibitor of methionyl-trna synthetase (metrs) in development for the treatment of clostridium difficile infection. methods: the spectrum of activity of rep3123 was determined by susceptibility testing of c. difficile and  non-target organisms. the mode of action was studied by enzyme inhibition assays, macromolecular synthesis assays, target overexpression and selection of spontaneous resistant mutants. results: rep3123 was active against a collection of 108 clinical isolates of c. difficile and against epidemic, moxifloxacin-resistant bi/nap1/027 strains (mic range=0.5-1 mg/l and mic(90) = 1  mg/l). the spectrum of activity included clinically important aerobic gram-positive cocci such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium (mic(90)s < 1 mg/l), but rep3123 was not active against most gram-negative bacteria. rep3123 targeted c. difficile metrs with a calculated inhibition constant (k(i)) of 0.020 nm, and selectivity was >1000-fold over human mitochondrial and cytoplasmic metrs. the specific mode  of action within bacterial cells was demonstrated by macromolecular synthesis assays that showed inhibition of protein synthesis by rep3123, and by mets overexpression, which resulted in a 16-fold increase in mic for rep3123. spontaneous rep3123-resistant mutants of c. difficile (mics, 4-128 mg/l) arose with frequencies of 10(-8)-10(-9) and harboured distinct point mutations within the mets gene, resulting in 13 different amino acid substitutions. most of the metrs substitutions caused reduced catalytic efficiency and a growth fitness burden. conclusions: rep3123 demonstrated a favourable microbiological profile and was found to target c. difficile with high specificity and selectivity.

TI  == study of microbial diversity in raw milk and fresh curd used for fontina cheese production by culture-independent methods.
AB  == the bacterial populations of raw milk employed for the production of fontina cheese in alpine farms located in different valleys and altitudes (from 700 to 2246 m above sea level) were investigated by culture independent techniques. total microbial dna was isolated from milk and curd samples and used as template  in polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to study the hypervariable v3 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene and analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). representative bands of dgge patterns were sequenced for identification purposes. the use of universal primer for pcr-dgge allowed the description of the bacterial community, not only for the presence of lactic acid bacteria, but also  for other adventitious species. dgge profiles obtained from milk and fresh curd samples were generally different and typical for each farm, although some recurrent bands were observed. cluster analysis of dgge profiles did not show high similarity among samples and it was probably dependent on the different geographical areas of pastures. some lactic acid bacteria (lab) recurred in many  samples (streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc lactis) indicating that alpine milk is a preferential niche for their colonization. the microbiota included not only mesophilic and thermoresistant lab but also adventitious bacteria (macrococcus caseolyticus, rothia spp.) and psychrotrophic bacteria (chryseobacterium spp., pseudomonas spp.), that were found in almost all samples, but disappeared after the warming up at 47-48 degrees c of coagulated milk. pantoea spp. was primarily  found in curds and only with a low incidence in milk samples, indicating the environmental origin. finally the sequencing data confirmed the presence of e. faecium, e. faecalis and s. thermophilus as major species present in the curd. these species were found also in raw milk, proving its importance as source of the typical fermenting microflora.

AB  == tigecycline has been investigated in combination with other antibacterials against a wide range of susceptible and multiresistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. combinations have been analysed in vitro, in animal models and in human case reports. in vitro, tigecycline combined with other antimicrobials produces primarily an indifferent response (neither synergy nor antagonism). nevertheless, synergy occurred when tigecycline was combined with rifampicin against 64-100% of enterococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacter spp. and brucella melitensis isolates. combinations of tigecycline with amikacin also showed synergy for 40-100% of enterobacter spp., klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus spp. and stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates. moreover, bactericidal synergisms occurred with tigecycline plus amikacin against problematic acinetobacter baumannii and proteus vulgaris, and with colistin against k. pneumoniae. data from animal experiments and case reports, although limited, displayed consistent beneficial activity of tigecycline in combination with other antibacterials against multiresistant organisms, including vancomycin  against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae in experimental meningitis, gentamicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa in experimental pneumonia, daptomycin against enterococcus faecium endocarditis, and colistin against k. pneumoniae bacteraemia and p. aeruginosa osteomyelitis. antagonism was extremely rare in vitro and was not reported in vivo. thus, tigecycline may be combined with a second antimicrobial as part of a combination regimen.

TI  == monitoring major mastitis pathogens at the population level based on examination  of bulk tank milk samples.
AB  == the objective was to determine the proportions and bacterial counts of major mastitis pathogens in samples of bulk tank milk (btm), as well as to clarify the  relationship between these bacteria counts and bulk tank somatic cell count (btscc). the purpose was to judge the importance of the counts of mammary pathogens for btscc at the population level. samples of btm were collected from 268 randomly selected anonymous dairy herds (with approximately 29 000 dairy cows). staphylococcus aureus, other coagulase-positive staphylococci, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus dysgalactiae were grouped as contagious pathogens, and streptococcus uberis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium as environmental pathogens. based on assessment of the dominant pathogen in each herd, environmental pathogens were found to dominate. counts of specific mammary pathogens in btm samples did not exceed a geometric mean of 1000 cfu/ml. significant differences were documented in btscc between btm samples containing str. agalactiae, staph. aureus, and str. dysgalactiae and btm samples that were pathogen-free. geometric means of btscc associated with these pathogens were noticeably higher than the overall btscc (str. agalactiae 243 628; staph. aureus  205 610; str. dysgalactiae 203 978; overall 173 000 cells/ml). it follows that the somatic cell count (scc) associated with these pathogens contributed substantially to the overall btscc. environmental pathogens predominated in samples of btm with scc <300x103/ml and contagious mastitis pathogens predominated in btm samples with scc >300x103/ml. no correlation was detected between bacterial counts of specific pathogens and btscc. this study revealed that the assessment of bacterial counts of mammary pathogens in samples of btm in relation to btscc is applicable for the monitoring of changes in the occurrence of major mastitis pathogens in dairy herds at a national level.

TI  == screening of surface properties and antagonistic substances production by lactic  acid bacteria isolated from the mammary gland of healthy and mastitic cows.
AB  == bovine mastitis (bm) is a costly disease in dairy cattle production. the prevention and treatment of mastitis is performed by applying antimicrobial products that negatively affect milk quality. in the last years, the use of probiotic microorganisms to prevent infections in humans and animals has being aggressively studied. samples from teat canal and milk (foremilk and stripping) were taken from healthy and mastitic mammary quarters. a screening of the surface properties and antagonistic substances production of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from the mammary gland was performed to select potential probiotic strains to prevent mastitis. somatic cell count, physico-chemical and microbiological studies were carried out. pre-selected microorganisms were genetically identified. compared with stripping milk, foremilk showed lower levels of fat and higher levels of ph, density, microorganism numbers, lower percentage of strains with mean and high hydrophobicity and mean autoaggregation  and higher number of strains able to produce hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins.  the other parameters analyzed were not statistically significant. one hundred and two lab strains were isolated. most of them had low degrees of hydrophobicity and autoaggregation. no correlation between these properties was found. antagonistic  metabolites were mainly produced by strains isolated from healthy quarters. most  of the pre-selected strains were identified as streptococcus bovis and weissella  paramesenteroides. three bacteriocin-producers were found and their products partially characterized. the results of this work are the basis for the further design of a specie-specific probiotic product able to prevent bm.

TI  == united states resistance surveillance results for linezolid (leader program for 2007).
AB  == the leader program (2007) monitors for emerging linezolid resistance in sampled us medical centers, initiated in 2004. for the current reported year, the number  of sites participating was increased from 50 to 60 institutions representing all  9 us census regions with 100 target organisms per site (6305 isolates, 105.1% compliance to protocol design). the organisms tested by reference broth microdilution methods were staphylococcus aureus (3318), coagulase negative staphylococci (cons, 1020), enterococci (705), streptococcus pneumoniae (622), and viridans group (249) or beta-hemolytic streptococci (391); also, d-test was used to determine inducible clindamycin resistance in s. aureus strains. linezolid remained very potent against all sampled species with mic(90) results ranging from 1 microg/ml (streptococci and cons) to 2 microg/ml (s. aureus and enterococci). only 0.44% of sampled strains were nonsusceptible to linezolid, compared with 0.45% in 2006. the nonsusceptible strains (23) were usually staphylococci (20) or enterococcus faecium (8), each with defined target mutations (g2576t, 24 strains) or a novel mobile cfr element in staphylococci (2  strains). in conclusion, linezolid activity sampled by the 4th year of this leader program showed sustained potency and spectrum (99.56% susceptibility). although the nonsusceptible strain isolation rates remained stable, a new plasmid-mediated ribosomal-based resistance mechanism emerged in s. aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis strains from arizona and ohio. the leader program appears to be an effective and sensitive surveillance tool to detect novel resistance phenotypes and genotypes.

TI  == highly resistant microorganisms in a teaching hospital: the role of horizontal spread in a setting of endemicity.
AB  == objective: to determine the incidence density of highly resistant organisms (hros) and the relative contribution of horizontal spread in a setting of endemicity. methods: prospective surveillance was performed among hospitalized patients during an 18-month period. enterobacteriaceae, nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecium--all considered highly resistant, according to dutch guidelines--were included. epidemiological linkage and nosocomial transmission were determined on the basis of molecular typing and hospital admission data. results: from 119 patients, we recovered a total of 170 unique hro isolates, as follows: escherichia coli, 96 isolates; klebsiella species, 11 isolates; enterobacter species, 8 isolates; proteus species, 9 isolates; citrobacter species, 5 isolates; pseudomonas species, 5 isolates; acinetobacter species, 3 isolates; morganella species, 2 isolates; salmonella species, 1 isolate; serratia species, 1 isolate; s. pneumoniae, 20 isolates; and s. aureus, 9 isolates. no vancomycin-resistant e. faecium was found. the incidence density was 4.3 hro isolates per 10,000 patient-days. the majority of hro isolates were unique, and nosocomial transmission was observed 4 times for highly resistant gram-negative bacilli (case reproduction rate, 0.05) and 4 times for penicillin-nonsusceptible  s. pneumoniae (case reproduction rate, 0.29). a stay on the intensive care unit was the main determinant for the recovery of an hro. conclusion: nosocomial transmission of hros was observed 8 times during the 18-month period. the intensive care unit was identified as the main reservoir of horizontal spread of  hros. this study shows that nosocomial transmission of hros is largely preventable using transmission precautions.

TI  == non-susceptibility trends among enterococci and non-pneumococcal streptococci from bacteraemias in the uk and ireland, 2001-06.
AB  == objectives: to describe the current patterns and trends in antimicrobial susceptibility in enterococci and streptococci (excepting pneumococci) from bacteraemia in the uk and ireland from 2001 to 2006. methods: in each year 2001-06, blood culture isolates were collected by 25 laboratories distributed across the uk and ireland. in total, there were 1408 isolates of enterococci, 1332 of beta-haemolytic streptococci and 1012 of alpha- and non-haemolytic streptococci. a single central laboratory re-identified the isolates and measured mics by the bsac agar dilution method. results: the prevalence of reduced susceptibility in streptococci and enterococci did not change significantly for most antibiotics, but trends were noted to increased ampicillin, imipenem and vancomycin resistance in enterococcus faecium. the prevalence of reduced susceptibility to macrolides and tetracycline in streptococci, to tetracycline and gentamicin (high level) in enterococci and to beta-lactams and glycopeptides  in e. faecium were all high, with some differences in the prevalence among species or groups. conclusions: reduced susceptibility to some antimicrobial agents among streptococci and enterococci remains common and continued surveillance is warranted.

TI  == in vitro activity of daptomycin against gram-positive cocci: the first multicentre study in greece.
AB  == a total of 10420 gram-positive cocci (including staphylococci, enterococci and various groups of streptococci) collected from clinically significant specimens in ten greek hospitals during 2006--2007 were tested for their susceptibility to  daptomycin. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined by the broth microdilution method. daptomycin demonstrated very high activity against enterococcus faecalis (mic at which 50% of the isolates were inhibited (mic50) =  1mg/l and mic at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited (mic90) = 1.36 mg/l), enterococcus faecium (mic50 = 1.36 mg/l and mic90 = 1.90 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (mic50 = 0.12 mg/l and mic90 = 0.50mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (mic50 = 0.09 mg/l and mic90 = 0.12 mg/l), streptococcus pneumoniae (mic50 = 0.24 mg/l and mic90 = 0.5 mg/l) and viridans group streptococci (mic50 = 0.50 mg/l and mic90 = 0.89 mg/l). resistance to linezolid and vancomycin for enterococci and to penicillin for streptococci appears to be independent of reduced susceptibility to daptomycin. on the other hand, daptomycin was also active against meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mic50 = 0.44 mg/l and mic90 = 0.78 mg/l) and meticillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (mic50 = 0.24 mg/l and mic90 = 0.44 mg/l); however, 0.9% of the staphylococci tested had an mic > 1mg/l, which is the clinical and laboratory standards institute breakpoint proposed for susceptibility. for all tested organism groups, resistance to daptomycin was not associated with glycopeptide resistance.

TI  == fluorescence in situ hybridisation (fish) accelerates identification of gram-positive cocci in positive blood cultures.
AB  == sepsis is a life-threatening disease with a high mortality rate. rapid identification of blood culture isolates plays a crucial role in adequate antimicrobial therapy in sepsis patients. to accelerate microbiological diagnosis, a comprehensive panel of oligonucleotide probes for fluorescence in situ hybridisation (fish) targeting gram-positive cocci was compiled and evaluated on 428 positive blood culture specimens. by combining genus-specific and species-specific probes, the assay allowed discrimination of staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci as well as differentiation of therapy-relevant pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium/durans. furthermore, the newly designed fish probes strep2, enco and granu targeted streptococcus pneumoniae/mitis, enterococcus spp. (except e. faecalis) and granulicatella adiacens group, respectively. the fish assay achieved an overall sensitivity of 98.65% and a specificity of 99.0% and therefore allowed rapid and  reliable molecular identification of gram-positive cocci in blood culture specimens.

TI  == ceftobiprole: an extended-spectrum anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin.
AB  == objective: to summarize and evaluate the literature concerning ceftobiprole. data sources: literature identification was conducted through medline (1966-february 2008) and international pharmaceutical abstracts (1970-february 2008) using the terms ceftobiprole, medocaril, bal 5788, ro-5788, bal 9141, ro 63-9141, pyrrolidinone cephalosporin, mrsa, complicated skin and skin-structure infections (csssis), community-acquired pneumonia, and nosocomial pneumonia. additional publications were identified through a review of articles and abstracts from infectious disease meetings. study selection and data extraction: all articles in english were evaluated and all pertinent information was included. data synthesis: ceftobiprole medocaril is an extended-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp., vancomycin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, enterobacteriaceae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. inactivity includes extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae and enterococcus faecium. preliminary data suggest that ceftobiprole may be effective with a 1-hour infusion of 500 mg every 12 hours for gram-positive infections and 500 mg every 8 hours with a 2-hour infusion for polymicrobial infections. two clinical trials support these dosing regimens for csssis. ceftobiprole was noninferior to vancomycin in suspected gram-positive csssis, with cure rates of 93.3% and 93.5%, respectively. furthermore, ceftobiprole was noninferior to vancomycin and ceftazidime in polymicrobial csssis (cure rates 90.5% vs 90.2%, respectively). although the total number of adverse effects was similar to those of the comparator, more patients in the ceftobiprole group experienced nausea, vomiting, and dysgeusia. conclusions: the  activity of ceftobiprole and limited clinical data suggest that it may be useful  as empiric monotherapy for csssi and in combination with other antimicrobials in  lower respiratory tract infections for which phase 3 clinical trials are currently exploring. although not shown in vitro, ceftobiprole may induce resistance due to its broad spectrum of activity. approval is expected for the treatment of csssi.

TI  == diversity of stress responses in dairy thermophilic streptococci.
AB  == exponential and stationary phase cells of 56 strains of the dairy streptococcus species s. thermophilus, s. macedonicus and s. salivarius, were exposed to acid,  osmotic, oxidative and heat stresses to investigate the diversity of their responses. three strains of dairy related streptococci, lactococcus lactis atcc11454, enterococcus faecium dsm20477 and enterococcus faecalis dsm20478, were included for comparison purposes. acid and heat adaptation and cross-protection to stress were studied in ten strains with different stress response patterns. cell death and the changes in protein expression were evaluated by plate counts and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis, respectively. all  strains of all species were highly tolerant of osmotic stress. with a few exceptions, acid and oxidative treatments reduced the number of viable cells by >5 log units but responses to heat stress were more variable. for some, but not all strains, stationary phase cells were more resistant to some or all stresses.  matrix cluster analysis was used to group strains on the basis of their pattern of stress response in seven clusters. significant associations between the sources of strains and stress resistance were found for acid and oxidative stresses. adaptation to stress during the exponential phase enhanced the survival of acid and heat stressed cells from 1 to 60,000-folds, but a detrimental effect  of adaptation on cell viability was evident for oxidative and osmotic stresses for three strains. adaptation and entry into the stationary phase resulted in significant changes of protein bands whose estimated molecular masses corresponded with those of proteins (dnak, gpre, groel, and groes) involved in the general stress response but no statistically significant correlation between  stress response and band intensity was evident.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of ceftobiprole, a novel anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin, tested against contemporary pathogens: results from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (2005-2006).
AB  == ceftobiprole is a 1st-in-class anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) extended-spectrum cephalosporin currently in clinical trials for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssis) and nosocomial pneumonia. this agent is also active against other prominent gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, making it an attractive candidate for  broad-spectrum therapy. we evaluated the in vitro potency of ceftobiprole tested  against the most commonly occurring bacterial pathogens as part of a global surveillance study for the years 2005 to 2006 (>60 medical centers in north america, latin america, and europe). all isolates (40 675) were susceptibility tested using reference broth microdilution methods. ceftobiprole inhibited 100% and >99% of tested s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at < or =4 and  < or =8 microg/ml, respectively, although mic90 values for oxacillin-resistant strains were 4-fold and 8-fold higher than oxacillin-susceptible isolates for the 2 groups. ceftobiprole was also broadly active against streptococcus pneumoniae,  beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci, inhibiting >98% of isolates at <  or =0.5 microg/ml. although ceftobiprole was generally inactive against enterococcus faecium, the majority of enterococcus faecalis strains (95.7%) were  inhibited at < or =4 microg/ml. this agent was similar in potency to the "3rd- and 4th-generation" cephems (mic50 values, < or =0.06 microg/ml) for all tested enterobacteriaceae. although cefepime provided enhanced coverage against klebsiella spp. (86.5% at < or =8 microg/ml versus 76.9-81.7% for ceftobiprole and ceftazidime), ceftobiprole and cefepime were superior to ceftazidime against  enterobacter spp. and citrobacter spp. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftobiprole was equal in potency to ceftazidime (mic50, 2 microg/ml) and 2-fold  more potent than cefepime. none of these agents inhibited >45% of acinetobacter spp. at 8 mug/ml. ceftobiprole is a new anti-mrsa beta-lactam with recognized activity against the most commonly occurring enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa, similar to that of extended-spectrum cephems. these characteristics warrant continued evaluation of the agent as empiric therapy for csssis, and in pneumonia, especially in those institutions/regions where mrsa and p. aeruginosa  may be prevalent.

TI  == [antibiotics susceptibility of streptococcus and enterococcus: data of onerba network].
AB  == this work was aimed to analyze trends in susceptibility to antibiotics among the  main species of beta-hemolytic streptococci involved in community-acquired infections in human (streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae), or in  animals (streptococcus suis and streptococcus uberis) and also among the main enterocci species, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. data were recorded since 1996 through the onerba networks. s. pyogenes, as the other beta-hemolytic streptococci studied remained fully susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics. however, susceptibility to macrolides is clearly decreasing in s. pyogenes. in 2002, only 62 to 65% of the strains according to the network considered, were susceptible to erythromycin. a similar trend was observed for s. agalactiae with only 75% of erythromycin susceptibility in 2002, and for both species isolated from animals s. suis and s. uberis, with respectively 35 and 76% of strains susceptible to erythromycin. in enterococci, susceptibility to beta-lactams remained stable between 2000 and 2004. indeed, the susceptibility to aminopenicillins remained high in e. faecalis (about 98%), whereas the proportion of e. faecium isolates susceptible to these antibiotics were lower than 60%. from 1999 to 2004, various studies conducted in french hospitals showed that the vancomycin resistance among enterococci accounted for less than 2%. however, the  recent emergence of glycopeptide resistant enterococci clusters in french hospitals is a matter of concern and emphasizes the need for an ongoing surveillance. such trend in macrolide resistance among s. pyogenes or s. agalactiae should consequently lead to propose other alternatives in case of beta-lactam allergy, and for pharyngitis, to rethink the place of the culture for susceptibility testing.

TI  == emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacterial pathogens.
AB  == development of multiple resistances to antibiotics in staphylococci, enterococci  and pneumococci became a health threat during the past 20 years, not only with respect to nosocomial infections. this resistance development is based on acquisition of resistance genes by predominant epidemic subpopulations (clonal complexes). although emergence and spread of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus is associated with a limited number of epidemic clones which have been widely disseminated, acquisition of sccmec elements by susceptible ancestors has  taken place at different times and at different locations. among staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecium, one clonal complex, which had acquired resistance genes at several occasions, is widely disseminated in hospitals. also  in streptococcus pneumoniae, antibiotic resistance is preferentially associated with clonal lineages which have a capacity for spreading. they became, however, more rare after introduction of the 7-valent conjugate vaccine.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of dx-619, a novel des-f (6)-quinolone against clinical isolates in china.
AB  == the aim of the study was to investigate in vitro antibacterial activity and bactericidal effect of dx-619 and other nine comparators against 1,101 recently collected clinical bacterial isolates in china. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of antimicrobials were determined by a clsi recommended standard agar dilution method and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs)  were examined by the broth dilution method. time-kill curves against representative isolates of staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and klebsiellia pneumoniae were also conducted. dx-619 exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against 1,101 clinical isolates, especially to multi-drug resistant gram-positive cocci. the mic(90)s of dx-619 were < or =0.016 and 0.125 mg/l against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus, 0.062 and 0.125 mg/l against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. epidermidis, respectively, which were 8-512 and 64-128 fold lower than those of comparative fluoroquinolones. the mic(90)s of dx-619 for penicillin-sensitive and -non-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium were 0.016, 0.062, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/l, respectively. the mic(90)s of dx-619 against enterobacteriaceae (except for escherichia coli) and glucose-nonfermenting bacilli were < or =4 mg/l, which were comparable to other comparators. mbcs and time-kill curves showed that dx-619 was a potent bactericidal agent. there was no significant inoculum effect on mics. but the activities of dx-619 against s. aureus, k. pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were decreased by acidic ph and  human serum. dx-619 was a potent antibacterial compound against multi-drug resistant bacteria including gram-positive cocci, such as s. aureus and enterococci, which may warrant further exploration.

TI  == decontamination effects of low-temperature plasma generated by corona discharge.  part ii: new insights.
AB  == the second part of our paper presents the results of experiments with the decontamination of surfaces by low-temperature plasma generated by corona discharge in air at atmospheric pressure. a simple device is described and the effects of the corona discharge on model microorganisms, viz. the yeast candida albicans, gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, neisseria sicca, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, gram-positive bacteria deinococcus radiodurans, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus sanguinis, and vegetative and spore forms of geobacillus stearothermophilus are discussed. a similar microbicidal effect after about one-minute exposure was observed in all vegetative forms of the microorganisms. measurement in growth inhibition zones on a semisolid medium was used to determine the dependence of the microbicidal effect on exposure time and the distance between electrodes. counting of colonies served to assess the microbicidal effect of the discharge on contaminated inert surfaces observable after more than 1 min exposure. geobacillus stearothermophilus spores were found to have several times lower susceptibility to the action of the discharge and the microbicidal effect was observed only after an 8 min exposure. reaction with the iodide reagent did not unambiguously demonstrate the difference between ozone and singlet oxygen as presumed active components of the corona. the area distribution of reactive oxygen species was determined; it was found to differ from the wartburg law depending on exposure time. qualitative evidence was obtained on the penetration  of the reactive oxygen species into the semisolid medium.

TI  == linezolid in children: recent patents and advances.
AB  == linezolid is the first approved member of a new generation of antibiotics, the synthetic oxazolidinones, to become available, with a broad spectrum of in vitro  activity against gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium. it has an excellent bioavailability both intravenously and orally and a very good safety profile both in adults and in children. with regards to its antimicrobial action, linezolid has a predominantly bacteriostatic action, rather than a bacteriocidal effect and is active against gram-positive bacteria that are resistant to other antibiotics. linezolid is currently showing great promise for the treatment of multi-resistant gram-positive infections, both in the community and in a hospital setting. clinical indications so far include skin and soft tissue infections, community-acquired or nosocomial pneumonia due to mrsa, vre bacteremia and community-acquired pneumonia due to penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. we anticipate that this new generation of antimicrobial agents will provide adequate cover in the future for infections that cause significant treatment failures so far, such as vre- associated endocarditis, bone and joint multi-drug resistant infections and possibly central nervous system infections, both in adult and children populations. some patents on linezolid are also discussed in this review.

TI  == screening of the enterocin genes and antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria in enterococcus strains obtained from different origins.
AB  == antimicrobial activities of 139 enterococcus isolates (48 e. faecium and 91 e. faecalis) obtained from canine feces, boiler meat samples, swine feces, wild waterfowl feces, and human feces were examined against respective bacteria, including streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enteritidis, and escherichia coli. bacteriocin (bac) production assay revealed that the antimicrobial activity against at least  one of 6 indicator strains (bac+ phenotype) was found in 51 (37%) isolates (29 e. faecium and 22 e. faecalis). twenty-four of 46 isolates positive for at least one of the enterocin structural genes (enta, entb, entl50ab, and cyll) showed a bac+  phenotype. the existence of other enterocins or nonenterocin factors was implied  because the bac+ phenotype was detected in a total of 27 enterococcus isolates that had none of the enterocin genes tested. the antimicrobial activity against gram-negative strains (salmonella enteritidis and e. coli) was detected in the 6  enterococcus isolates that had either the enta, entb, entl50ab or cyll genes. moreover, the proportion of the antimicrobial activity against l. monocytogenes among the cyll-positive e. faecalis isolates showing beta-hemolysis (10/16) was significantly (p<0.01) higher than among those lacking beta-hemolysis (2/15). the results suggested that certain characteristics are likely to be associated with the antimicrobial activity against specific organisms.

TI  == a class iia peptide from enterococcus mundtii inhibits bacteria associated with otitis media.
AB  == peptide st4sa, produced by enterococcus mundtii st4sa, inhibits the growth of acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients diagnosed with middle ear infections. the peptide adsorbed at a level of 94% to s. pneumoniae 40, pseudomonas aeruginosa 25 and e. faecium hklhs. low concentrations of peptide st4sa (51200 arbitrary units (au)/ml) caused dna and enzyme leakage from target cells, whilst 1638400au/ml caused cell lysis.  no decrease in antimicrobial activity was observed when tested on solid medium with human blood as base. peptide st4sa revealed a similar level of activity compared with tetracycline (30 microg), but much higher activity compared with nasal sprays, aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, lincosamides, macrolides, nitroimidazole, penicillin, quinolones, sulphonamides, chloramphenicol, furazolidone, fusidic acid, rifampicin, trimethoprim, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin when tested in vitro. peptide st4sa  dissipates the proton-motive force and may be used in the treatment of multidrug-resistant strains where antibiotics are excluded from cells by efflux pumps dependent on the membrane proton gradient.

TI  == [microorganisms isolated from blood cultures and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns at a university hospital during 1994-2003].
AB  == background: blood culture is important for the determination of the etiologic agent of bacteremia. analysis of blood culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility trend can provide clinicians with relevant information for the empirical treatment of patients. methods: the species and antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates from blood cultures at the severance hospital during 1994-2003 were analysed. blood specimens were cultured for 7 days using tryptic soy broth and thioglycollate medium. identification of organism was based on conventional methods or commercial kit systems. antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by a disk diffusion method. results: of 536,916 blood specimens cultured, 24,877 (4.6%) from 13,102 patients were positive. among the isolates, 93.1% were aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria, 3.3% anaerobes, and 3.6% fungi. escherichia coli was isolated most frequently, followed by staphylococcus  aureus, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, enterococcus spp., and klebsiella pneumoniae. the proportion of patients with enterococcus faecium and k. pneumoniae gradually increased during this study. enterococcus, s. aureus and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus were frequently isolated from the age group of less than 2 yr. e. coli, enterococcus spp., k. pneumoniae and s. aureus from the age group of over 50 yr. oxacillin-resistant s. aureus decreased, whereas vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and imipenemresistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and  acinetobacter baumannii increased. conclusions: e. coli was the most common cause of bacteremia and s. aureus, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, and k. pneumoniae were frequently isolated pathogens. the bacteremia due to enterococcus, k. pneumoniae, fungi, vancomycin-resistant e. faecium, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii gradually increased during this period.

TI  == [influence of probiotic enterococci on the growth of streptococcus agalactiae].
AB  == individual features of sensitivity of some strains of group b streptococci (gbs)  to influence of 2 probiotic cultures of enterococcus faecium (sf68 and l3) have been studied by double agar test. e. faecium l3 strain had higher antagonistic activity to gbs. two genes encoding enterocins a and b as well as genes responsible for the expression of the former two genes were found in the genome of this strain. the supernatant and peptide extract of e. faecium l3 contained thermostable low molecular weight peptides which inhibited growth of listeria and gbs but at lesser extent compared with native enterococci. obtained data allow to suggest that antagonistic activity of enterococci against gbs may be affiliated with production of enterocins a and b and can be increased by the presence of other metabolites.

TI  == redox potential to discriminate among species of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == aims: to verify to what degree reducing capacity is a characterizing parameter of a species, and of the strains themselves within a given species, of lactic acid bacteria. methods and results: eighty-eight strains belonging to 10 species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from traditional italian cheeses were studied for their reduction activity: enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis,  lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus helveticus and pediococcus pentosaceus. it was observed that the lactococci reached minimum redox potential  before the lactobacilli. the reduction rate of enterococcus spp. and l. lactis ssp. lactis was higher than that of the streptococci and lactobacillus spp. all the p. pentosaceus strains had poor reduction activity compared with the other species. conclusions: the evolution of the redox potential in milk over a time span of 24 h has been found to be a parameter that characterizes a species: the different courses corresponding to the species in question are clearly evident, and interesting differences can also be noted within the same species. significance and impact of the study: the reduction aptitude of strains might be  used to select and adapt appropriate strains for use as starters for dairy products.

TI  == variability of bacterial biofilms of the "tina" wood vats used in the ragusano cheese-making process.
AB  == ragusano cheese is a "protected denomination of origin" cheese made in the hyblean region of sicily from raw milk using traditional wooden tools, without starter. to explore the ragusano bacterial ecosystem, molecular fingerprinting was conducted at different times during the ripening and biofilms from the wooden vats called "tinas" were investigated. raw milks collected at two farm sites, one on the mountain and one at sea level, were processed to produce ragusano cheese.  raw milk, curd before and after cooking, curd at stretching time (cheese 0 time), and cheese samples (4 and 7 months) were analyzed by pcr-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (pcr-ttge) and by classical enumeration microbiology. with the use of universal primers, pcr-ttge revealed many differences between the raw milk profiles, but also notable common bands identified as streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii, and enterococcus faecium. after  the stretching, ttge profiles revealed three to five dominant species only through the entire process of ripening. in the biofilms of the two tinas used, one to five species were detected, s. thermophilus being predominant in both. biofilms from five other tinas were also analyzed by pcr-ttge, pcr-denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis, specific pcr tests, and sequencing, confirming the  predominance of lactic acid bacteria (s. thermophilus, l. lactis, and l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis) and the presence of a few high-gc-content species, like coryneform bacteria. the spontaneous acidification of raw milks before and after contact with the five tinas was followed in two independent experiments. the lag period before acidification can be up to 5 h, depending on the raw milk and the specific tina, highlighting the complexity of this natural inoculation system.

TI  == enterococci and streptococci.
AB  == besides staphylococcus aureus, other gram-positive bacteria have become multidrug-resistant and cause therapeutic problems, particularly amongst hospitalised patients. the acquisition of vancomycin resistance by strains of enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis is of particular concern and has resulted in treatment failures. some of the infections caused by these bacteria do respond to treatment with new antibiotics that have been released in the last  few years, however more options are required as not all enterococci are inherently susceptible and resistance is beginning to emerge amongst those that were susceptible. resistance to commonly used antibiotics is also emerging in streptococcus spp., particularly to the tetracyclines and macrolides. in both genera, multiresistant strains spread between patients and between hospitals. in  the laboratory, these bacteria show considerable susceptibility to tigecycline, with little propensity to develop resistance, indicating that tigecycline could assume an important role in controlling infections caused by these gram-positive  bacteria.

TI  == evaluation of the in vitro activity of tigecycline against multiresistant gram-positive cocci containing tetracycline resistance determinants.
AB  == this study was undertaken to test the in vitro activity of tigecycline against 117 clinically relevant gram-positive pathogens and to correlate this activity with their resistance gene content. overall, tigecycline showed a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) range of 0.015-0.5mg/l, able to inhibit potently all multiresistant streptococci, enterococci and mr staphylococci. tigecycline was active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococci, with mics for 90% of the organisms (mic(90)) of 0.25 mg/l and 0.12 mg/l, respectively, being more active than linezolid (mic(90)=2 mg/l) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (mic(90)=0.5 and 2-4 mg/l, respectively). molecular characterisation of resistance determinants demonstrated the concomitant presence of different classes of genes: in particular, tet(m), erm(b) and erm(c) in streptococcus agalactiae; tet(o), variably associated with different erm genes, in streptococcus pyogenes; vana, tet(m) and erm(b) in enterococcus faecalis, and  vana and erm(b) in enterococcus faecium. all the mrsa strains harboured sccmec and erm genes and 50% possessed tet(k) with tet(m) genes. staphylococcus epidermidis strains were only resistant to erythromycin. these results clearly demonstrate that tigecycline has a mic(90) range of 0.015-0.5 mg/l both against tetracycline-susceptible and -resistant isolates carrying other resistance determinants, suggesting that this drug could play an important role in the treatment of infections caused by these multiresistant gram-positive pathogens.

AB  == background: ceftaroline (ppi-0903m, t-91825) is a novel cephalosporin, administered as an n-phosphono prodrug. we investigated its in vitro activity and resistance selection potential. methods: mics were determined by clsi agar dilution, but with varied inocula. mutant selection was investigated in single- and multi-step procedures. results: mics for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) were 0.5-2 mg/l, compared with 0.12-0.25 mg/l for methicillin-susceptible s. aureus; corresponding values for coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.25-2 and 0.06-0.12 mg/l, respectively. even with 2% nacl added, all mrsa were susceptible at 2 mg/l. mics for enterococcus faecalis were from 0.25 to 8 mg/l; e. faecium was resistant. mics for escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., morganella morganii and proteeae without acquired resistance were 0.06-0.5 mg/l versus 0.12-1 mg/l for enterobacter, serratia and citrobacter  spp. and 2-8 mg/l for acinetobacter spp. mics rose to 1-2 mg/l for many enterobacteriaceae with classical tem beta-lactamases, and were much higher for those with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), hyperproduced ampc or k1 enzymes. mics for strains with classical tem/shv beta-lactamases rose if the inoculum was increased to 10(6) cfu/spot; this effect was even more marked for those with esbls. resistance due to class a beta-lactamases was reversed by clavulanate. geometric mean mics were 0.005, 0.05 and 0.09 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains, respectively-lower than for any comparator beta-lactam. haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis were very susceptible, although with marginally raised mics for beta-lactamase-positive moraxella strains and for haemophili with chromosomal ampicillin resistance. ceftaroline selected ampc-derepressed enterobacter mutants similarly to cefotaxime in single-step experiments; in multi-step procedures it selected esbl variants of blatem in e. coli. resistance selection was not seen with s. aureus, h. influenzae or pneumococci. conclusions: ceftaroline has impressive anti-mrsa and anti-pneumococcal activity. slight lability to classical tem and shv beta-lactamases is exceptional for an oxyimino-cephalosporin, but was reversible  with clavulanate, as was the greater resistance mediated by esbls. resistance selection occurred with enterobacteriaceae, not mrsa.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of oleanolic acid from salvia officinalis and related compounds on vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre).
AB  == an extract from salvia officinalis (sage) leaves showed antimicrobial activity against vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). we isolated the effective compound and identified it as oleanolic acid, a triterpenoid. we also tested antimicrobial activity of similar triterpenoids, ursolic acid, uvaol, betulinic acid and betulin. we found that ursolic acid also showed antimicrobial activity against vre. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of oleanolic acid and ursolic acid were 8 and 4 microg/ml, respectively. these two compounds also showed antimicrobial activity against streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). these compounds showed bactericidal activity against vre at least for 48 h when added at concentrations  that were two-times higher than their mics.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-positive bacterial isolates from the asia-pacific region and an in vitro evaluation of the bactericidal activity of daptomycin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin: a sentry program report (2003-2004).
AB  == medical centres in eight countries in the asia-pacific region provided 2391 isolates for the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program during 2003-2004 to determine their susceptibility to several antimicrobial classes, including daptomycin. daptomycin, vancomycin and teicoplanin minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) were determined for 120 isolates of staphylococcus aureus, which included wild-type (wt) methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and strains with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin (hetero-vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (hvisa)).  oxacillin-resistant staphylococcal isolates were much less susceptible to the other tested agents compared with oxacillin-susceptible strains. vancomycin resistance was higher among enterococcus faecium (10.3%) than enterococcus faecalis (0.4%), and macrolide resistance was high both for beta-haemolytic (17.7%) and viridans group (48.7%) streptococci. daptomycin (mic for 90% of the organisms (mic(90))=0.5-1mg/l) was two-fold more potent than vancomycin, with >99% susceptibility when tested against staphylococci. all tested isolates of e.  faecalis (mic(90)=2mg/l) and beta-haemolytic streptococci (mic(90)=0.5mg/l) were  susceptible to daptomycin. daptomycin mic and mbc values were slightly higher for the hvisa isolates compared with wt-mrsa, with mbc/mic ratios of only 1-2 for both groups. the mbc/mic ratio for vancomycin was often greater when tested against these strains, particularly hvisa. in contrast, teicoplanin mbc/mic ratios were significantly higher, with many of the strains showing values consistent with tolerance (>or=32). daptomycin was demonstrated to have excellent in vitro activity when tested against gram-positive isolates collected from asia-pacific countries, including hvisa strains.

TI  == drug susceptibility testing of clinical isolates of streptococci and enterococci  by the phoenix automated microbiology system.
AB  == background: drug resistance is an emerging problem among streptococcal and enterococcal species. automated diagnostic systems for species identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (ast) have become recently available. we evaluated drug susceptibility of clinical isolates of streptococci and enterococci using the recent phoenix system (bd, sparks, md). diagnostic tools included the new smic/id-2 panel for streptococci, and the pmic/id-14 for enterococci. two-hundred and fifty isolates have been investigated: beta-hemolytic streptococci (n = 65), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 50), viridans group streptococci (n = 32), enterococcus faecium (n = 40), enterococcus faecalis (n = 43), other catalase-negative cocci (n = 20). when needed, species id was determined using molecular methods. test bacterial strains were chosen among those carrying clinically-relevant resistance determinants (penicillin, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, glycopeptides). ast results of the phoenix system were compared to minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values measured by the etest method (ab biodisk, solna, sweden). results: streptococci: essential agreement (ea) and categorical agreement (ca) were 91.9% and 98.8%, respectively. major (me) and minor errors (me) accounted for 0.1% and 1.1% of isolates, respectively. no very major errors (vme) were produced. enterococci: ea was 97%,  ca 96%. small numbers of vme (0.9%), me (1.4%) and me (2.8%) were obtained. overall, ea and ca rates for most drugs were above 90% for both genera. a few vme were found: a) teicoplanin and high-level streptomycin for e. faecalis, b) high-level gentamicin for e. faecium. the mean time to results (+/- sd) was 11.8  +/- 0.9 h, with minor differences between streptococci and enterococci. conclusion: the phoenix system emerged as an effective tool for quantitative ast. panels based on dilution tests provided rapid and accurate mic values with regard to clinically-relevant streptococcal and enterococcal species.

TI  == in-vitro profile of a new beta-lactam, ceftobiprole, with activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == ceftobiprole is a novel, broad-spectrum cephalosporin with in-vitro activity against common gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. it forms a stable inhibitory complex with staphylococcus aureus penicillin-binding protein (pbp) 2' (2a), resulting in enhanced activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). in recent studies of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, the ceftobiprole  mic(90) value was most frequently < or =1.0 mg/l (mic range < or =0.25-1.0 mg/l). for mrsa, mic(90) values were generally 2.0 mg/l (mic range < or =0.06-4.0 mg/l). mics for all streptococcal species, except penicillin-resistant streptococcus viridans but including penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, ranged from < or =0.008 to 2.0 mg/l. ceftobiprole is active against enterococcus faecalis (mic(90) = 4 mg/l), but not generally active against enterococcus faecium (mic(90) > 16 mg/l). ceftobiprole displayed bactericidal activity against gram-negative pathogens comparable to that of cefepime, ceftazidime or piperacillin-tazobactam in early studies. however, recent data show activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa similar to that of cefepime but less than that of  ceftazidime. ceftobiprole, like cefepime, is stable in the presence of most class a non-extended spectrum beta-lactamases and inducible class c beta-lactamases. ceftobiprole is a poor inducer of ampc beta-lactamase and a poor substrate for hydrolysis by ampc beta-lactamase. studies of ceftobiprole in several animal models have demonstrated potent in-vivo efficacy against infections caused by mrsa, including strains intermediately resistant to vancomycin. it was also efficacious in murine infections caused by gram-negative bacteria with mic values < or =2 mg/l. the broad spectrum of activity demonstrated by ceftobiprole in vitro and in vivo suggests that it may have potential for empirical treatment of  suspected gram-negative and gram-positive infections, including those caused by mrsa.

TI  == synthesis and in vitro evaluation of substituted phenyl-piperazinyl-phenyl oxazolidinones against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == with the incidence of linezolid-resistant enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium and staphylococcus aureus, modification of linezolid at the 5- and/or 3-positions led to the development of a series of 3-(methoxyl-phenyl)-piperazinyl-phenyl oxazolidinone analogues. these compounds were tested in vitro against six gram-positive standard organisms (s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. pneumoniae, s. albus, streptococcus enteridis and s. nonhemolyticus). 5-acetylaminomethyl oxazolidinones bearing fluorine at 3'-position of phenyl ring showed activities against several gram-positive bacteria (mic: 3.13-6.25 mug/ml). the position of methoxyl group on the phenyl ring of piperazine group affected antibacterial spectrum. 3-(4'- (para-methoxyl-phenyl)-piperazinyl)-(3'-fluoro)-phenyl-5-acetylaminomethyl oxazolidinone was found active against 5 gram-positive organisms except s. nonhemolyticus, whereas 3-(4'-(ortho-methoxyl-phenyl)-piperazinyl)-(3'-fluoro)-phenyl-5-acetylaminomethyl oxazolidinone was found active only against 2 gram-positive organisms, namely s.  albus, s. enteridis.

TI  == multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16s rrna gene pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == in vitro effect of the presence of human albumin or human serum on the bactericidal activity of daptomycin against strains with the main resistance phenotypes in gram-positives.
AB  == objectives: bactericidal activity depends on antibiotic-bacteria couples, resistance phenotype and theoretically on protein binding. this work explores the influence of protein binding on the bactericidal activity of two antibiotics, daptomycin versus vancomycin, that exhibit, respectively, different c(max) (56 versus 25.5 mg/l), protein binding (91.7% versus 36.9%) and thus theoretical free-drug fractions (4.7 versus 16.1 mg/l). methods: the effect of the presence of physiological concentrations of human albumin (4 g/dl) or human serum (90%) on the bactericidal activity of daptomycin was studied against gram-positive isolates with troublesome resistance phenotypes [multidrug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (mdrsp), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate mrsa (mrsa-hvi) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium]. killing curves (final inocula of approximately 10(7) cfu/ml) were performed using daptomycin and vancomycin concentrations similar to the c(max) obtained in serum. results: daptomycin was rapidly bactericidal (> or =3 log(10) initial inocula reduction) against s. pneumoniae and s. aureus, regardless of the strain tested or the presence of albumin or human serum (that slightly delayed bactericidal activity). against vancomycin-susceptible or -resistant enterococci, daptomycin exhibited rapid bactericidal activity, delayed to 8 and 24 h, respectively, by human albumin. vancomycin exhibited much slower bactericidal activity against mdrsp and methicillin-susceptible or -resistant s. aureus, but was never bactericidal against mrsa-hvi and vancomycin-susceptible or -resistant e. faecium. conclusions: daptomycin exhibited rapid bactericidal activity against the strains of the three gram-positive species tested, regardless of resistance phenotype or  the presence of physiological concentrations of albumin.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with fish and the fish farm environment, established by amplified rrna gene restriction analysis.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria have become a major source of concern for aquaculture in recent decades. in addition to true pathogenic species of worldwide significance, such as streptococcus iniae and lactococcus garvieae, several species have been reported to produce occasional fish mortalities in limited geographic areas, and  many unidentifiable or ill-defined isolates are regularly isolated from fish or fish products. to clarify the nature and prevalence of different fish-associated  bacteria belonging to the lactic acid bacterium group, a collection of 57 isolates of different origins was studied and compared with a set of 22 type strains, using amplified rrna gene restriction analysis (ardra). twelve distinct  clusters were delineated on the basis of ardra profiles and were confirmed by sequencing of soda and 16s rrna genes. these clusters included the following: lactococcus raffinolactis, l. garvieae, lactococcus l., s. iniae, s. dysgalactiae, s. parauberis, s. agalactiae, carnobacterium spp., the enterococcus "faecium" group, a heterogeneous enterococcus-like cluster comprising indiscernible representatives of vagococcus fluvialis or the recently recognized  v. carniphilus, v. salmoninarum, and aerococcus spp. interestingly, the l. lactis and l. raffinolactis clusters appeared to include many commensals of fish, so opportunistic infections caused by these species cannot be disregarded. the significance for fish populations and fish food processing of three or four genetic clusters of uncertain or complex definition, namely, aerococcus and enterococcus clusters, should be established more accurately.

TI  == characterization of macrolide resistance in gram-positive cocci from colombian hospitals: a countrywide surveillance.
AB  == objective: the characterization of macrolide resistance in gram-positive cocci recovered from colombian hospitals. methods: the resistance profiles and mechanism of macrolide resistance were investigated in isolates of streptococcus  pneumoniae (1679), staphylococcus aureus (348), coagulase-negative staphylococci  (cons) (175), and enterococcus spp (123). minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) for erythromycin (ery) and clindamycin (cli), detection of macrolide resistance genes, phenotypic characterization, and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge) of macrolide-resistant pneumococci were performed. results: resistance to ery and cli was 3.3% and 2.3% for s. pneumoniae, 58% and 57% for s. aureus (94% for both compounds in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa)), and 78.6% and 60.7% in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, respectively. ery resistance was 62% in enterococcus faecalis and 82% in enterococcus faecium. the mls(b)-type accounted for 71% of s. pneumoniae and 100% of mrsa. the erm(a) gene was prevalent in mrsa, erm(b) in s. pneumoniae  and enterococci, and erm(c) in cons isolates. efflux pump genes (mef(a) genes) were mostly identified in s. pneumoniae (24%). the most common genotype amongst ery-resistant pneumococci was the spain(6b)-2 clone. conclusions: the prevalence  of macrolide resistance is low in colombian pneumococci and high in mrsa (cmls(b)-type).

TI  == a review of the current place of glycopeptides in turkish medical practice.
AB  == background: glycopeptide antibiotics are considered by many investigators to be the last resort in the treatment of gram-positive bacterial infections. objective: the aim of this review was to assess the place of glycopeptides in the treatment of common gram-positive bacteria in accordance with the current epidemiologic data in turkey. methods: a search of both the english- and turkish-language literature indexed on medline, ulakbim (turkey), and pleksus (turkey) was performed using the terms: vancomycin, teicoplanin, and glycopeptides, or their turkish-language counterparts. the complete texts of the  articles found in these databases were obtained from the electronic library of gulhane medical academy, ankara, turkey. articles from regional journals, without the support of an electronic format, were obtained by direct communication. articles of interest were those based on studies occurring in turkish populations, with special consideration given to publications in press after 2002. results: staphylococci were the most frequent gram-positive pathogens encountered in turkish hospitals. studies have found that approximately 74% of strains were staphylococcus aureus and the remaining strains were coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons). overall methicillin resistance in staphylococci was reported as approximately 60%. in turkey, s aureus was one of the most common infectious agents found inside hospitals and is deemed a growing  threat in the community. while the rate of methicillin resistance in community-acquired isolates is approximately 4%, the data from hospitals suggest  that reduced resistance comprises most of the isolates. in the studies reviewed,  older quinolones like ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin seem to be ineffective in nearly half of the s aureus isolates. alternatives like rifampicin, gentamicin, tetracycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (tmp/smx), clindamycin, and erythromycin have had substantial resistance profiles in >50% of the strains. in  recent turkish studies, in vitro profiles of linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin (qd), and daptomycin have had positive results. as in the s aureus isolates, resistance trends have been observed in the cons group of pathogens. the possible use of beta-lactams seems restricted, and alternative approaches have become necessary. quinolones, gentamicin, tetracycline, tmp/smx, clindamycin, and erythromycin have resistance profiles of >50%. although glycopeptide resistance was not detected, the frequency of heterogenous vancomycin-intermediate s aureus, a precursor to future resistance, was 13% in 1 study. current studies in turkey have found that enterococcus faecalis comprises three quarters of enterococci while the rest are comprised of enterococcus faecium. initial studies performed with linezolid, qd, and daptomycin suggest that these drugs might be effective alternatives for future enterococcal infections that may have high glycopeptide resistance. approximately 8% of the streptococcus pneumoniae strains had high-level resistance in turkey. however, 10 million units of crystallized penicillin or 3 g of oral amoxicillin maintains the optimum treatment of pneumococcal infections outside the central nervous system (cns). resistance profiles in third-generation cephalosporins in turkey range between 2% and 2.5%.  conclusions: in turkey, a review of the existing literature found that the current use of glycopeptides in pneumococcal infections is restricted to cns infections facing therapeutic failure in due course. however, the belief that these drugs are the last resort, either in staphylococcal or enterococcal infections, is no longer valid. if a patient has a critical status due to probable gram-positive microorganisms, clinicians should consider the empiric use of glycopeptides. however, new molecules such as linezolid, qd, and daptomycin, offered for use in the treatment of gram-positive bacterial diseases, should be reserved for the future, when glycopeptides eventually become obsolete.

AB  == introduction: the objective of this study was to determine the current antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the most frequent multi-resistant bacteria and to analyze any possible changes with respect to the two vira studies carried out in 2001 and 2004. methods: in february 2006, the 40 participating hospitals sent the following microorganisms: non-penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (92), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (290), clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (136), ampicillin-resistant enterococcus faecium (89), ampicillin-resistant haemophilus  influenzae (67), ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli (365), pseudomonas aeruginosa (181), and acinetobacter baumannii (92). the hospitals provided epidemiological data on these microorganisms. susceptibility was determined with  a broth microdilution method. results: among the non-penicillin-susceptible s. pneumoniae isolates, the proportion of those ones resistant to this antibiotic showed a significant (p < 0.001) decrease (59.8% in 2001, 30.2% in 2004 and 14.3% in 2006). among mrsa, we detected one isolate nonsusceptible to linezolid, four resistant to quinupristin-dalfopristin and one strain with a vancomycin mic of 4  microg/ml. the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing e. coli was 12.1%. resistance of a. baumannii to imipenem varied from 27% in the 2001-2004 period to 47.8% in 2006 (p < 0.005). conclusion: these results again emphasize that resistance surveillance systems are an important tool for preventing the emergence and spread of multi-resistant pathogens.

AB  == a nationwide antimicrobial resistance surveillance has been conducted since 1997  in korea. in this study, susceptibility test data generated in 2004 by konsar group hospitals were analyzed and compared to those at a commercial laboratory. in hospitals, the rank orders of organisms in 2004 were identical to those in 2003. the most prevalent species was staphylococcus aureus (20.2%) in hospitals,  but escherichia coli (29.7%) in the commercial laboratory. the proportions of enterococcus faecium to all isolates of enterococcus faecalis plus e. faecium were 47.2% in hospitals and 24.9% in the commercial laboratory. the mean resistance rates of significant antimicrobial-organism combinations in hospitals  were: oxacillin-resistant s. aureus (68%), oxacillin-resistant (penicillin- nonsusceptible) streptococcus pneumoniae (68%), vancomycin-resistant e. faecium (25%), cefotaxime-resistant e. coli (14%), ceftazidime- and cefoxitin-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae (34% and 32%, respectively), and imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa (17% and 24%, respectively). in conclusion, oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant k. pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp.  and p. aeruginosa were prevalent in 2004. increasing trends were observed for vancomycin-resistant e. faecium, cefoxitin- resistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae,  and imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. and p. aeruginosa. certain antimicrobial- organism combinations were also prevalent among the commercial laboratory-tested strains.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in the southeastern mediterranean--preliminary results from the armed project.
AB  == sporadic reports from centres in the south and east of the mediterranean have suggested that the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in this region appears to  be considerable, yet pan-regional studies using comparable methodology have been  lacking in the past. susceptibility test results from invasive isolates of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecium and faecalis routinely recovered from clinical samples of blood and cerebrospinal fluid within participating laboratories situated in algeria, cyprus, egypt, jordan, lebanon, malta, morocco, tunisia and turkey were collected as part of the armed project. preliminary data from the first two years of the project showed the prevalence of penicillin non-susceptibility in s. pneumoniae to range from 0% (malta) to 36% (algeria) [median: 29%] whilst methicillin resistance in staphylococcus aureus varied from 10% in lebanon to 65% in jordan [median: 43%]. significant country specific resistance in e. coli was also seen,  with 72% of isolates from egyptian hospitals reported to be resistant to third generation cephalosporins and 40% non-susceptible to fluoroquinolones in turkey.  vancomycin non-susceptibility was only reported in 0.9% of e. faecalis isolates from turkey and in 3.8% of e. faecium isolates from cyprus. the preliminary results from the armed project appear to support previous sporadic reports suggesting high antibiotic resistance in the mediterranean region. they suggest that this is particularly the case in the eastern mediterranean region where resistance in s. aureus and e. coli seems to be higher than that reported in the  other countries of the mediterranean.

TI  == use of the phoenix automated system for identification of streptococcus and enterococcus spp.
AB  == the phoenix system (becton dickinson diagnostic systems, sparks, md) was evaluated for identification (id) to the species level of streptococci and enterococci. two hundred clinical isolates were investigated: beta-hemolytic streptococci (n = 50), streptococcus pneumoniae organisms (n = 46), viridans group streptococci (n = 31), enterococcus faecium (n = 36), enterococcus faecalis (n = 25), and other catalase-negative cocci (n = 12). the api system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) was used as a comparator. molecular methods (sequencing of 16s rrna and zwf and gki genes and ddl gene amplification) were used to investigate discordant results. upon resolution of discrepancies, correct species id was achieved by the phoenix system for 121/129 (93.8%) streptococci and 63/70  (90.0%) enterococci. excellent results were obtained for s. pneumoniae (45/45) and beta-hemolytic streptococci (49/50). with regard to viridans streptococci, the accuracy of the phoenix system was 83.9%. among the latter organisms, the best performance was obtained with isolates of the streptococcus sanguinis group  and streptococcus anginosus group; problems were instead encountered with the streptococcus mitis group. four e. faecium and three e. faecalis isolates were misidentified as enterococcus casseliflavus/enterococcus gallinarum or enterococcus durans. thus, these isolates were identified only at the genus level. compared with commercially available systems, the phoenix system appears a reliable diagnostic tool for identifying clinically relevant streptococci and enterococci. the smic/id-2 panel proved particularly effective for beta-hemolytic streptococci and pneumococci.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == gram-positive bacteria are common causes of bloodstream and other infections in hospitalized patients in the united states, and the percentage of nosocomial bloodstream infections caused by antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacteria is increasing. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) are of particular concern. in the united states, approximately 60% of staphylococcal infections in the intensive care unit are now caused by mrsa, and percentages continue to rise. outbreaks of hospital-acquired mrsa (ha-mrsa) are typically the result of clonal spread by mrsa being transferred from patient to patient, frequently using healthcare personnel as intermediaries. ha-mrsa strains are generally multidrug resistant. vancomycin is the standard treatment for serious mrsa infections, but a few cases of vancomycin-resistant s aureus (vrsa) have recently emerged in the united states. community-acquired mrsa (ca-mrsa) is also increasing. soft tissue infections are the most frequent presentations of ca-mrsa, but life-threatening invasive infections occur as well, including necrotizing pneumonia. the mechanisms of methicillin resistance are the same for ca-mrsa and ha-mrsa, but susceptibilities to non-a-lactam antibiotics often differ. ca-mrsa exhibits broader antibiotic susceptibility than does ha-mrsa. the proportion of enterococci resistant to vancomycin continues to rise in the hospital setting, with the overwhelming majority of infections due to enterococcus faecium. clonal  spread of vre has been documented, but polyclonal outbreaks associated with antimicrobial use are also common. the relations between antibiotic use and vre colonization are complex and related to the antienterococcal activity, biliary excretion, and antianaerobic activity of the antibiotic. recent results show a decline in invasive pneumococcal disease (ipd) since the introduction of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, and suggest that, where available, vaccines may be useful in the battle to slow the spread of resistant gram-positive cocci.

TI  == [the effects of probiotics on symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome].
AB  == background/aims: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is a functional gastrointestinal  (gi) tract disorder that has heterogeneous clinical presentations such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal distension. it is known that several mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of ibs. probiotics may target one or more pathophysiologic pathways in ibs and may improve the symptoms  of ibs. however, the results of studies about probiotics on ibs are controversial. therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of probiotics on gi symptoms and intestinal gas volume changes in patients with ibs. methods: forty patients were randomly allocated to be treated with medilac ds (bacillus subtilis, streptococcus faecium) (n=20) or placebo (n=20) in a double-blind, prospective manner. the change in intestinal gas volume and symptom scores after 4-week treatment were evaluated for the efficacy. results: there was no significant difference in bloating, frequency of gas expulsion, frequency of defecation, and hardness of stool before and after the treatment. however, the severity of abdominal pain and the frequency of abdominal pain decreased significantly in medilac ds group (2.4+/-1.3 cm/day --> 1.6+/-1.6 cm/day, 1.7+/-1.3/day --> 1.0+/-1.0/day) (p=0.044, p=0.038), but not in placebo group (2.1+/-2.0 cm/day --> 1.8+/-2.1 cm/day, 1.3+/-1.2/day --> 1.4+/-1.9/day). in both groups, intestinal gas volume at baseline, after 2-week treatment, and after 4-week treatment did not show significant change. medilac ds was well tolerated without adverse events. conclusions: medilac ds is a safe and useful probiotic agent for the treatment of abdominal pain in patients with ibs.

TI  == [study of vaginal and intestinal microflora of women in the prenatal period and its correction in dysbacteriosis].
AB  == a comparative research of the structure of vaginal and intestinal microflora in norm and at kidney pathologies in women in the prenatal period was carried out. at physiologically normal course of pregnancy microbiocenosis of vagina and intestine does not contain pathogenic and conditional-pathogenic microorganisms.  lactic acid bacteria are fixed within the limits of 10(5)-10(8) cfu/1 ml in the vagina secretion and 10(7)-10(8) cfu/1 g in the intestine content. the spore microorganisms have completely disappeared in vaginal biocenosis of women with pyelonephritis after pharmacotherapy; and colibacterias has disappeared in 62% of women. quantity of lactic acid bacteria has also decreased. quantity of e. coli (10(8)- 10(9)) cfu/g, sporous microorganisms (10(3)-10(4)) cfu/g and yeast (10(4)-10(5)) cfu/g has considerably increased in the content of intestine. lactic acid bacteria in content of the vagina are presented by: lactobacillus acidophilus, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. vaginalis; in content of the intestine--l. plantarum and l. fermentum. all the isolated strains of lactobacilli are resistant to metrogyl and amphotericin, 87%--to cephoxitine, cypropfloxacine. twenty three of 24 strains of lactic acid bacteria--antagonists  of pathogenic microflora have shown adhesion to vaginal epthelium. the degree of  adhesive activity depends on the strain and genus specificity of cultures. the highest index of adhesiveness in indicated in enterococcus faecium (5.82 - 7.62)  and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (2.74 - 6.40) strains. the screening of strains has been performed, which suppress growth of gas-producing microflora. the strain of lactobacillus plantarum 200d proved to be the most active one. a complex of cultures of the lactic bacteria providing normalization  of microbial cenosis of the vagina in women in the prenatal period has been selected as based on the data obtained. the biotechnology of production of vaginal suppositories is developed.

TI  == performance accuracy of antibacterial and antifungal susceptibility test methods: report from the college of american pathologists microbiology surveys program (2001-2003).
AB  == context: the college of american pathologists microbiology surveys program provides external proficiency samples that monitor the performance of nearly 3000 laboratories that perform and report antimicrobial susceptibility tests. objective: to summarize results obtained with bacterial and yeast challenge samples (2001 through 2003). design: one organism every 4 months was tested by surveys participants against antibacterials/antifungals by routinely used methods. reports were graded by interpretive category (susceptible, intermediate, resistant) based on an 80% consensus of referees/participants. results: the most  common antibacterial test methods/systems were vitek (38%-43%), microscan (39%-43%), and the disk diffusion test (14%-15%), although etest was most used for fastidious species. yeastone was the dominant antifungal test (50%-55%). antifungal results demonstrated continuous, improved accuracy (83%-88%), highest  for yeastone (96%) and broth microdilution (95%) methods. antibacterial test accuracy was consistently greater than 97% against gram-positive organism challenges and greater than 98% against gram-negative challenges. for gram-negative strains with well-characterized resistance mechanisms, the accuracy by method was disk diffusion greater than broth microdilution greater than automated systems. major problems identified were (1) haemophilus influenzae control ranges require re-evaluation, (2) overuse of beta-lactamase tests, (3) errors among enterococcus faecium against penicillins (vitek 2, microscan), (4) false-susceptible results with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole against coagulase-negative staphylococci (microscan), (5) macrolide false-susceptibility  for beta-hemolytic streptococcus (microscan), (6) flawed reporting for antimicrobials not active at the infection site, (7) use of outdated interpretive criteria, and (8) failure to follow clinical and laboratory standards institute testing/reporting recommendations. conclusions: susceptibility tests were generally performing satisfactorily as measured by the surveys, but serious errors were identified with some drug/organism combinations that may require action by the clinical and laboratory standards institute and/or the food and drug administration.

TI  == dna microarray for detection of macrolide resistance genes.
AB  == a dna microarray was developed to detect bacterial genes conferring resistance to macrolides and related antibiotics. a database containing 65 nonredundant genes selected from publicly available dna sequences was constructed and used to design 100 oligonucleotide probes that could specifically detect and discriminate all 65 genes. probes were spotted on a glass slide, and the array was reacted with dna templates extracted from 20 reference strains of eight different bacterial species (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, escherichia coli, and bacteroides fragilis) known to harbor 29 different macrolide resistance genes. hybridization results showed that probes reacted with, and only with, the expected dna templates and allowed discovery of three unexpected genes, including msr(sa) in b. fragilis, an efflux gene that has not yet been described for gram-negative bacteria.

AB  == the antibiotic resistance surveillance project ar-iss, started in 2001, is based  on a network of 62 sentinel microbiological laboratories throughout the country.  the laboratories collect and transmit data to the istituto superiore di sanita on the antibiotic susceptibility of bloodstream isolates of 7 species: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis/faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca ed escherichia coli. they also send selected bacterial strains for further characterization. results of the first year of surveillance are presented and are compared with data from the previous study earss-italia and from other european countries. oxacillin resistance in s. aureus appears to be stable, however, it remains one of the highest in europe (41,5%). no strain with intermediate susceptibility or resistance to vancomycin has been isolated. in s. pneumoniae, the level of penicillin resistance is moderate (10,8%), but macrolide resistance has increased greatly (37,6% versus 28,6% of the previous study), following a tendency common to several european countries. unexpectedly, vancomycin resistance in e. faecium was found to be 18%, the highest in europe. presumptive esbl production in gram-negative organisms can be  estimated at 20% in klebsiella and 1% in e. coli. ampicillin and ciprofloxacin resistance in e. coli (respectively 50% and 18%) are among the highest in europe. in conclusion, the rate of antibiotic resistance in the species studied is worrisome and requires continuing monitoring. although some activities of ar-iss  need improvements, the surveillance has the potentiality to produce relevant and  representative data about antibiotic resistance in italy that can be used for comparison at the european level.

TI  == the effect of temperature on the antimicrobial activity of optisol-gs.
AB  == purpose: to determine the survival of different bacteria inoculated in optisol-gs at refrigerated storage temperature (6 degrees c) and after subsequent warming to room temperature (19-22 degrees c). methods: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus  faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were chosen from stock clinical isolates for inclusion in the study. the first group consisted of  12 optisol-gs vials. the second group consisted of 12 optisol-gs vials containing corneas inappropriate for transplantation according to the eye bank association of america (ebaa) protocols. each group was inoculated with 3 concentrations of approximately 10, 10, and 10 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml of each bacterial species and then refrigerated per ebaa protocol. after 48 hours of refrigeration, all vials were placed at room temperature (rt) and counts were performed at 48, 50 (2 hour rt), 54 (6 hour rt), 60 (12 hour rt), 72 (24 hour rt), and 96 (48 hour rt) hours. at 96 hours, the corneal tissue from 10 and 10 inocula were cultured.  all samples underwent serial dilution, spiral plating on blood agar plates, and incubation at 35 degrees c. viable colony counts were determined at 24 hours. results: except for the 10 cfu/ml inocula of p. aeruginosa, all isolates were viable after 48 hours of refrigeration. rapid bactericidal activity was observed  against p. aeruginosa after 2 hours at rt, with complete sterilization by 6 hours. the rate and extent of killing against s. aureus were influenced by the initial inoculum. bactericidal activity was achieved after 2 hours at rt with 10  cfu/ml of s. aureus versus 24 hours with the 10 inoculum. of note, bactericidal activity was not observed against s. pneumoniae and e. faecium following 24 hours of storage at rt. the presence of corneal tissue did not affect viable counts, with counts from corneal tissue cultures reflecting the counts seen from optisol-gs after 48 hours at rt. conclusions: the antimicrobial activity of optisol-gs was reduced at refrigerated temperature and enhanced at rt. bactericidal activity was not observed against e. faecium at either refrigerated  temperature or rt.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of a novel peptide deformylase inhibitor, lbm415, tested against respiratory tract and cutaneous infection pathogens: a global surveillance report (2003-2004).
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the spectrum of activity and potency of lbm415, the first of the peptide deformylase inhibitor (pdfi) class to be developed for treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections and uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections (ussti), against a large, contemporary international collection of targeted pathogens collected during 2003-2004. methods: a total of  21,636 isolates were tested by reference broth microdilution methods as part of a longitudinal international antimicrobial resistance surveillance study. characteristics of the organism collection included resistance to oxacillin among 35.0% of staphylococcus aureus and 76.0% of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons); resistance to penicillin (mic > or = 2 mg/l) among 18.0% of streptococcus pneumoniae; vancomycin resistance among 20.0% of enterococcus spp. and ampicillin resistance among 22.0% of haemophilus influenzae. results: lbm415 displayed potent activity against staphylococci, streptococci, enterococcus faecium and moraxella catarrhalis, with > or = 99.0% of strains being inhibited at < or = 4 mg/l; 97.0% of enterococcus faecalis isolates and 92.0% of h. influenzae isolates were also inhibited at this concentration. seventy-seven percent of burkholderia  cepacia and 82.0% of stenotrophomonas maltophilia were inhibited at < or = 8 mg/l. no differences in lbm415 activity against s. aureus, cons, s. pneumoniae, enterococcus spp. and h. influenzae were detected for subsets susceptible or resistant to antimicrobials such as oxacillin, penicillin, ampicillin, macrolides, vancomycin and fluoroquinolones. while regional differences were apparent with some comparator agents, sensitivity to lbm415 did not vary significantly among strains from the various geographic areas sampled. one isolate of s. aureus displayed high-level resistance to lbm415 owing to multiple  sequence changes in resistance phenotype genes (defb and fmt), despite the absence of the compound in clinical practice. this isolate remained susceptible to all other antimicrobials tested except for penicillin. conclusions: with few differences detected among strains from various geographic regions, the first pdfi class agent to enter clinical development has consistently demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against commonly isolated pathogens associated with uncomplicated respiratory and cutaneous infections. these compounds represent a significant therapeutic advance owing to their novel mechanism of action and antibacterial spectrum, including activity against resistant organisms, should pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters support their continued development. given the detection of a pre-existing pdfi-resistant isolate of s. aureus as demonstrated here, surveillance for resistance among the pdfi-targeted  pathogens following introduction of this class of agent into clinical usage will  be an important component of future studies.

TI  == bloodstream infections in organ transplant recipients receiving alemtuzumab: no evidence of occurrence of organisms typically associated with profound t cell depletion.
AB  == background: alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against cd52, a cell surface antigen expressed on b and t lymphocytes, monocytes and nk cells.  its use results in a profound decrease in cd4 positive t lymphocytes. alemtuzumab is used as induction immunosuppression and therapy for rejection in organ transplant recipients in some centers. we followed a cohort of 449 consecutive transplant recipients who received alemtuzumab to determine the occurrence of bloodstream infections, particularly those previously associated with decrease in cd4 positive t lymphocytes. patients and methods: fifteen percent (69/449) patients had at least one episode of bloodstream infection. however, no patient had bacteremia with streptococcus pneumoniae, listeria monocytogenes, non-typhoidal salmonella or mycobacterium avium complex. fungaemia was rare, occurring in 1.5% of patients. the most common organisms isolated from the blood  were staphylococcus aureus (21 episodes), coagulase negative staphylococcus (14 episodes), klebsiella pneumoniae (12 episodes), enterococcus faecium (11 episodes), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 episodes), enterococcus faecalis (9 episodes) and escherichia coli (7 episodes). discussion: we conclude that although alemtuzumab use is associated with profound cd4 positive t lymphocyte depletion, alemtuzumab does not seem to be associated with an increased risk of bloodstream infection with pathogens typically seen in other disorders of cd4 cell depletion, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of xrp2868, a new oral streptogramin composed of a combination of rpr132552 (streptogramin a) and rpr202868 (streptogramin b), was evaluated against a collection of clinical gram-positive isolates with characterized phenotypes and genotypes of streptogramin resistance. the effects of genes for resistance to streptogramin a or b on the activity of xrp2868 and its components were also tested by cloning these genes individually or in various combinations in gram-positive recipient strains susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin. the species tested included staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, and other species of streptococci. xrp2868 was generally fourfold more potent than quinupristin-dalfopristin against s. aureus,  e. faecium, and streptococci and had activity against e. faecalis (mics = 0.25 to 1 microg/ml). xrp2868 appeared to be affected by the same mechanisms of resistance as those to quinupristin-dalfopristin. nevertheless, the strong activity of factor a of the oral streptogramin enabled the combination to be very potent against streptogramin-susceptible staphylococci, streptococci, and e. faecium (mics = 0.03 to 0.25 microg/ml) and to retain low mics against the strains harboring a mechanism of resistance to factor a or factor b of the streptogramin. however, the combination of mechanisms of resistance to factors a  and b caused an increase in the mics of xrp2868, which reached 1 to 4 mug/ml. as  with the other streptogramins, there was a reduction in the bactericidal effect of xrpr2868 when the staphylococcal strains acquired a constitutively expressed erm gene.

TI  == acquired antimicrobial resistance in the intestinal microbiota of diverse cat populations.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of acquired antimicrobial resistance in the resident intestinal microbiota of cats and to identify significant differences between various cat populations. escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium and streptococcus canis were isolated as faecal indicator bacteria from rectal swabs of 47 individually owned cats, 47 cattery cats and 18 hospitalised cats, and submitted through antimicrobial sensitivity tests. the results revealed that bacteria isolated from hospitalised and/or cattery cats were more frequently resistant than those from individually owned cats. e. coli isolates from hospitalised cats were particularly resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline and sulfonamide. both enterococci and streptococci showed high resistance to tetracycline and in somewhat lesser extent to erythromycin and tylosin. most e. faecium isolates were resistant to lincomycin and penicillin. one e. faecalis as well as one e. faecium isolate from hospitalised cats showed 'high-level resistance' (mic > 500 microg/ml) against gentamicin, a commonly used antimicrobial agent in case of human enterococcal infections. the results of this research demonstrate that the extent of acquired  antimicrobial resistance in the intestinal microbiota of cats depends on the social environment of the investigated population. it is obvious that the flora of healthy cats may act as a reservoir of resistance genes.

AB  == the spectrum of activity and potency of doripenem, a broad-spectrum parenteral carbapenem currently in clinical development, was evaluated using 16 008 clinical bacterial isolates collected as part of an international surveillance project during 2003. using reference broth microdilution methods, doripenem was found to  be highly active against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (2705 and 297 isolates, respectively; mic90s 0.06 mg/l), with a potency greater than that of other carbapenem antibiotics. against enterococci (1474 isolates), with the exception of enterococcus faecium,  doripenem displayed modest activity (mic50 4). doripenem was among the most potent agents tested against streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci and beta-haemolytic streptococci (885, 140 and 397 isolates; mic(90)s 0.5, 0.5 and 0.03 mg/l, respectively). for enterobacteriaceae (> 6200 isolates), doripenem was four- to 32-fold more active than imipenem against wild-type isolates (mic90s 0.03-0.5 mg/l). mic90s for confirmed extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae (121 and 155  isolates; 0.06 and 0.12 mg/l, respectively) were two-fold higher than for wild-type isolates. doripenem was also active against citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp. and serratia spp. (mic90s 0.06-0.25 mg/l), including ceftazidime-resistant isolates. doripenem and meropenem were the most active agents among all beta-lactams against pseudomonas aeruginosa (829 isolates; mic50/90s 0.5/8 and 0.5/16 mg/l, respectively), whereas doripenem and imipenem were the most active agents against acinetobacter spp. (155 isolates; mic50/90s 0.5/4 and <or= 0.5/2 mg/l, respectively). doripenem was slightly more potent (mic50 2 mg/l) than ertapenem and imipenem (mic50 4 mg/l), and had a potency similar to that of meropenem (mic50 2 mg/l), against burkholderia cepacia (20 isolates). both haemophilus influenzae (1824 isolates) and moraxella catarrhalis  (108 isolates), including beta-lactamase-positive isolates, were susceptible to doripenem (mic90s 0.25 and 0.03 mg/l, respectively). doripenem displays the favourable characteristics of other carbapenems, and appears to offer certain advantages in terms of potency, spectrum and beta-lactamase stability when compared with some carbapenems used currently to treat nosocomial infections.

TI  == in vitro activity of linezolid against key gram-positive organisms isolated in the united states: results of the leader 2004 surveillance program.
AB  == since the approval of linezolid in 2000, sporadic reports of resistance have been given and a greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms of resistance has  been gained. however, since these developments, an updated status of the in vitro activity of linezolid against gram-positive organisms from the united states has  not been reported. the leader 2004 surveillance initiative was undertaken to obtain current and representative data on the activity of linezolid against key species, including isolates with significant resistance phenotypes. organisms were isolated during 2004 and included 2,872 staphylococcus aureus, 496 coagulase-negative staphylococcus (cns), 428 enterococcus faecalis, 196 enterococcus faecium, and 422 streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. all s. aureus isolates (54.2% oxacillin resistant) were susceptible to linezolid (mic90 = 2 microg/ml); mic distributions were consistent, regardless of oxacillin or multidrug resistance status. for cns, one nonsusceptible isolate was encountered  (staphylococcus epidermidis; mic = 32 microg/ml), but overall, the mic(90) (1 microg/ml) was lower than that obtained with s. aureus. for e. faecalis and e. faecium, 99.5% and 96.4% of isolates, respectively, were linezolid susceptible. both species had an mic90 of 2 microg/ml, and mic distributions did not vary with the vancomycin susceptibility status of the populations analyzed. linezolid nonsusceptibility was not encountered among the s. pneumoniae isolates. these findings indicate that linezolid nonsusceptibility has remained rare among staphylococci and uncommon and sporadic among enterococci. nonetheless, careful and ongoing monitoring of the in vitro effectiveness of linezolid will be needed  so that any changes to the current status may be detected as soon as possible.

TI  == dutch guideline for preventing nosocomial transmission of highly resistant microorganisms (hrmo).
AB  == hospitals are faced with the increasingly rapid emergence and dissemination of antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms. us and european guidelines on the prevention of antimicrobial resistance in hospitals were, until recently, mainly  directed at methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). in 2004, the dutch working party on infection prevention issued a guideline on the prevention  of nosocomial transmission of highly resistant microorganisms (hrmo), in order to fulfill the growing need for additional guidance on the control of other pathogens with acquired resistance and the potential to spread within hospitals (such as glycopeptide-resistant enterococcus faecium, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, extendedspectrum beta-lactamase producing enterobacteriaceae, and other (multi)drug-resistant gram-negatives). in addition  to providing criteria for defining hrmo, the dutch guideline provides recommendations on isolation of patients, active surveillance, and contact tracing. the guideline will enable the comparison of hrmo rates between hospitals, and may be used to evaluate the efficacy of programs to control antibiotic use and/or nosocomial transmission of resistant pathogens. the eventual success of nationwide implementation of this guideline remains to be established in the coming years.

TI  == bacteriophage therapy: a revitalized therapy against bacterial infectious diseases.
AB  == bacteriophage (phage) therapy involves using phages or their products as bioagents for the treatment or prophylaxis of bacterial infectious diseases. much evidence in support of the effectiveness of phage therapy against bacterial infectious diseases has accumulated since 1980 from animal model studies conducted in western countries. reports indicate that appropriate administration  of living phages can be used to treat lethal infectious diseases caused by gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, vibrio vulnificus, and salmonella spp., and gram-positive bacteria, such as enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus. the phage display system and genetically modified nonreplicating phages are also effective for treatment of helicobacter pylori and p. aeruginosa, respectively. in addition to phage particles per se, purified phage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolase (lysin) is also reported to be effective for the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases caused by gram-positive bacteria such  as streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, bacillus anthracis, and group b streptococci. all phage lysins that have been studied to date exhibit immediate and strong bacteriolytic activity when applied exogenously. furthermore, phage-coded inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis (protein antibiotics), search methods for novel antibacterial agents using phage genome informatics, and vaccines utilizing phages or their products are being developed. phage therapy will compensate for unavoidable complications of chemotherapy such as the appearance of multidrug resistance or substituted microbism.

TI  == monitoring the lactic acid bacterial diversity during shochu fermentation by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == the presence of lactic acid bacteria (lab) during shochu fermentation was monitored by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and by bacteriological culturing. no lab were detected from fermented mashes by pcr-dgge using a universal bacterial pcr primer set. however, pcr-dgge using a new primer  specific for the 16s rdna of lactococcus, streptococcus, tetragenococcus, enterococcus, and vagococcus and two primers specific for the 16s rdna of lactobacillus, pediococcus, leuconostoc, and weissella revealed that enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus nagelii, lactobacillus plantarum, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and weissella cibaria inhabited in shochu mashes. it was also found that the lab community composition during shochu fermentation changed after the main ingredient and water were added during the fermentation process. therefore, we confirmed that pcr-dgge using all three primers specific for groups of lab together was well suited to the study of the lab diversity in shochu mashes. the results of dgge profiles were similar to the results of bacteriological culturing. in conclusion, lab are present during shochu fermentation but not dominant.

TI  == [elucidation of the taxonomic status of industrial strains of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria by sequencing of 16s rrna genes].
AB  == phenotypic characteristics and results of pcr tests for the presence of species-specific genes indicate that a number of strains of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria previously considered as belonging to streptococcus thermophilus are actually closely related to enterococci. in the present study, partial (over  500 nucleotides) sequencing of 16s rrna genes from 12 strains of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria used as starters for manufacturing sour milk products on the territory of the commonwealth of independent states (cis) has been performed. according to the results of the sequencing, seven of the strains have been classified with enterococcus durans. the earlier classification (based on pcr tests) of two of the strains as s. thermophilus and three of the strains as e. faecium has been confirmed. the data obtained demonstrate that the enterococci e. durans and e. faecium are widely used as thermophilic starters for manufacturing  sour milk products on the territory of the cis.

TI  == macrolide and lincosamide resistance genes of environmental streptococci from bovine milk.
AB  == environmental streptococcus isolates from bovine milk were identified to the species and strain level and screened for resistance to macrolide and lincosamide antibiotics by phenotypic and genotypic methods. isolates were tested for resistance to erythromycin and pirlimycin by broth microdilution assays. presence of ribosomal methylase genes (erma, ermb, ermc) and efflux pump genes (mefa/e, msra/c) was detected by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). resistance to pirlimycin (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) = 8microg/ml) was detected in 6 of 13 enterococcus isolates that were identified as e. faecium by api20strep typing. msrc was detected in 10 enterococcal isolates but the detection of msrc was not associated with phenotypic resistance. msrc negative isolates were reclassified as enterococcus mundtii based on sequencing of housekeeping genes. resistance to  erythromycin and pirlimycin (mic > 16microg/ml) was detected in 4 of 4 streptococcus dysgalactiae and 12 of 20 streptococcus uberis isolates and was encoded by ermb. all streptococcus isolates tested negative for erma, ermc, mefa/e and msra/c. among ermb positive streptococci, three alleles were identified based on a 527 bp gene fragment. each allele was detected in at least  two herds. the same alleles have also been detected in other bacterial species from bovine and non-bovine hosts and farm soil, suggesting a theoretical potential for horizontal transfer of macrolide resistance genes on dairy farms.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sm-216601, a new broad-spectrum  parenteral carbapenem.
AB  == sm-216601 is a novel parenteral 1beta-methylcarbapenem. in agar dilution susceptibility testing, the mic of sm-216601 for 90% of the methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) strains tested (mic(90)) was 2 microg/ml, which was  comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid. sm-216601 was also very potent against enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-resistant strains (mic(90) = 8 microg/ml). sm-216601 exhibited potent activity against penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae, moraxella  catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, with mic(90)s of less than 0.5 microg/ml, and intermediate activity against citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa. the therapeutic efficacy of sm-216601 against experimentally induced  infections in mice caused by s. aureus, e. faecium, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa reflected its in vitro activity and plasma level. thus, sm-216601 is a promising  candidate for nosocomial bacterial infections caused by a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multiresistant pathogens.

TI  == enumeration and speciation of enterococci found in marine and intertidal sediments and coastal water in southern california.
AB  == aims: to determine the levels and species distribution of enterococci in intertidal and marine sediments and coastal waters at two beaches frequently in violation of bacterial water standards. methods and results: faecal indicator bacteria were extracted from sediment and enumerated using membrane filtration. high levels of enterococci were detected in intertidal sediments in a seasonal river and near a storm drain outlet. low levels were found in marine sediments at 10 m depths and in surf zone sand. bacterial isolates presumptively identified as enterococcus on mei media were speciated. the predominant species found in both water and sediment included enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus mundtii. a number of isolates (11-26%) from regulatory water samples presumptively identified as enterococci on mei media were subsequently identified as species other than enterococcus. at both study sites, the distribution of species present in water was comparable with those in sediments and the distribution of species was similar in water samples passing and exceeding bacterial indicator standards. conclusions: high levels of enterococcus in intertidal sediments indicate retention and possible regrowth in this environment. significance and impact of the study: resuspension of enterococci that are persistent in sediments may cause beach water quality failures and calls into question the specificity of this indicator for determining recent faecal contamination.

AB  == bacteriocin-producing strains of lactobacillus plantarum st23ld and st341ld, enterococcus faecium st311ld and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides st33ld were isolated from the brine of spoiled black olives. the bacteriocins produced by all four strains inhibited the growth of gram-positive bacteria (e. faecalis, l. casei and streptococcus pneumoniae), but also escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. strain st23ld produced two bacteriocins (st23lda and st23ldb of approximately 3.0 and 14.0 kda, respectively), with a combined maximum level of activity of 25,600 au/ml after 18 h of growth. the same level of activity was recorded for bacteriocin st341ld (approximately 3.0 kda), but after  16 h. bacteriocins st311ld (ca. 2.3 kda) and st33ld (ca. 2.7 kda) were produced at much lower levels (6400 au/ml), and only after 20 h of growth. bacteriocin activity was destroyed after treatment with proteolytic enzymes and triton x, but not when treated with alpha-amylase, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea and edta, or when heated for 20 min at 121 degrees c. addition of bacteriocins st23ld, st341ld and st311ld to cells of lactobacillus casei lhs in logarithmic phase resulted in  growth inhibition for one hour, followed by a slight increase in optical density  over the next seven hours. bacteriocin st33ld also inhibited the growth of strain lhs, but to a lesser extent. bacteriocins st23ld, st341ld and st33ld remained at  the same level of activity for 6 h at ph<4.0. however, the activity of bacteriocin st311ld decreased by 50% within 2 h at ph 4.4. the possibility of the bacteriocin adsorbing to the producer cell and proteolytic degradation is unlikely.

AB  == although automated continuous-monitoring blood culture systems are both rapid and sensitive, false-positive and false-negative results still occur. the objective of this study, then, was to evaluate negative results occurring with bact/alert 3d blood culture systems. a total of 1032 samples were cultured with the bact/alert 3d automated blood culture system, using both aerobic (fa) and anaerobic (fn) [corrected] media, and 128 of these samples yielded positive results. a total of 904 negative blood samples were then subcultured in 5% sheep  blood agar, eosin methylene blue, chocolate agar, and sabouraud-dextrose agar. organisms growing on these subcultures were subsequently identified using both vitek32 (biomerieux, durham, nc) and conventional methods. twenty four (2.6%) of  the 904 subcultures grew on the subculture media. the majority (83.3%) of these were determined to be gram-positive microorganisms. fourteen (58.3%) were coagulase-negative staphylococci, two (8.3%) were bacillus spp., one (4.2%) was staphylococcus aureus, and one (4.2%) was identified as enterococcus faecium. streptococcus pneumoniae and neisseria spp. were isolated together in two (8.3%)  vials. gram-negative microorganisms comprised 12.5% of the subcultures, of which  two (8.3%) were found to be pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one (4.2%) was pseudomonas fluorescens. the other isolate (4.2%) was identified as candida albicans. we conclude that the subculture of negative results is valuable in the  bact/alert 3d system, especially in situations in which only one set of blood cultures is taken.

TI  == the streptogramin antibiotics: update on their mechanism of action.
AB  == antibiotics of the streptogramin class are an association of two types of chemically different compounds, group a molecules and group b molecules, acting in synergy. the combination of these molecules generally inhibits bacterial growth at a lower concentration than does either the group a or group b molecule  alone and is often bactericidal against strains of bacteria for which each type of molecule alone is only bacteriostatic. the semisynthetic streptogramin quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500), the first water-soluble member of this class, is under development for the treatment of severe infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, glycopeptide-resistant enterococcus faecium, and other organisms. the streptogramins block the translation of mrna into protein. both group a and group b molecules bind to the peptidyl-transferase domain of the bacterial ribosome. the group b molecule stimulates the dissociation of peptidyl-trna from the ribosome and may interfere with the passage of the completed polypeptide away from the peptidyl-transferase centre. the group a molecule inhibits the elongation of the polypeptide chain by preventing both the binding of aminoacyl-trna to the ribosomal a site and the formation of the peptide bond. when the two types of molecule are used in combination, the binding of the group  a molecule alters the conformation of the ribosome such that the affinity of the  ribosome for the b molecule is increased. this accounts, in part or entirely, for the observed synergy. this synergy is unaffected by ribosomal modifications conferring resistance to the macrolides, lincosamides, and group b molecules alone.

AB  == oxazolidinones have become reliable clinical and candidate antimicrobial agents to be utilized for infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-positive cocci,  especially vancomycin-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant staphylococci. however, mutational resistance of the ribosomal target has been described for several species. longitudinal surveillance remains necessary to monitor for this evolving linezolid resistance pattern. a survey of linezolid and several comparison gram-positive focused agents was initiated in 2002 (7971 strains, >99.0% compliance) for 54 participating sites in the united states, canada, europe (6 nations), latin america (2 nations), and the asia pacific (2 nations). the 5 and 25 sites in canada and the united states, respectively, submitted 200 strains each to a central laboratory for organism identification/confirmation and reference mic processing. the 10 remaining nations had 200 strain samples from 1 to 4 separate institutions. linezolid resistance (mic >/= 8 microg/ml) was confirmed by alternative susceptibility testing methods (etest, ab bio disk, solna, sweden; disk diffusion method) and target mutation characterization by pcr and sequence analysis. linezolid activity against the 6 major organism groups did not vary between geographic areas. a total of 98.1% of linezolid mic values were between 0.5 and 2 microg/ml, and only 0.5% of results were at 4 microg/ml, which included 32 staphylococcus aureus (0.9%) and 5 (0.5%) enterococcal isolates. linezolid resistance was detected in only 4 isolates (0.05%): 1 each staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecium, and a viridans group streptococcus. all 4 isolates had a g2576u mutation in the 23s rrna target. linezolid activity as outlined by these zyvox annual appraisal of potency and spectrum (zaaps) program  results demonstrate sustained, near complete activity against contemporary gram-positive isolates on 4 monitored continents and in centers utilizing oxazolidinones. rare linezolid-resistant strains were identified in the united states only (0.05% resistance overall).

TI  == characterization of a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecium gm-1 isolated  from an infant.
AB  == aim: to partially characterize the bacteriocin produced by the gm-1 strain of enterococcus faecium, isolated from the faeces of a newborn human infant. methods and results: the bacteriocin produced by e. faecium gm-1 showed a broad spectrum  of activity against indicator strains of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, vibrio spp., salmonella typhimurium, listeria monocytogenes, lactobacillus acidophilus, and streptococcus thermophilus. treatment of the gm-1 bacteriocin with proteolytic enzymes reduced its inhibitory activities. the bacteriocin was stable at 100 degrees c for 20 min and displayed inhibitory activity at neutral ph. the optimal production of bacteriocin from e. faecium gm-1 was obtained when  the culture conditions were ph 6.0-6.5 and 35-40 degrees c. the inhibitory activity of the bacteriocin was not substantially changed by the use of different carbon sources in the media, except when galactose was substituted for glucose. the use of a sole nitrogen source caused a decrease in inhibitory activity. a bacteriocin gene similar to enterocin p was identified from the total dna of e. faecium gm-1 by pcr and direct sequencing methods. conclusion: e. faecium gm-1, which was isolated from the faeces of a newborn baby, produces an enterocin p-like bacteriocin with inhibitory activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including food-borne pathogens. significance and impact of the study: e. faecium gm-1, isolated from infant faeces, produces a new bacteriocin that is similar to enterocin p. this bacteriocin is heat stable and has a broad antibacterial spectrum that includes both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == human defensins.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides are small, cationic, amphiphilic peptides of 12-50 amino acids with microbicidal activity against both bacteria and fungi. the eukaryotic  antimicrobial peptides may be divided into four distinct groups according to their structural features: cysteine-free alpha-helices, extended cysteine-free alpha-helices with a predominance of one or two amino acids, loop structures with one intramolecular disulfide bond, and beta-sheet structures which are stabilised by two or three intramolecular disulfide bonds. mammalian defensins are part of the last-mentioned group. the mammalian defensins can be subdivided into three main classes according to their structural differences: the alpha-defensins, beta-defensins and the recently described theta-defensins. mammalian alpha-defensins are predominantly found in neutrophils and in small intestinal paneth cells, whereas mammalian beta-defensins have been isolated from both leukocytes and epithelial cells. recently, two novel human beta-defensins, human  beta-defensin-3 (hbd-3), and human beta-defensin-4 (hbd-4) have been discovered.  similar to hbd-1 and hbd-2, hbd-3 has microbicidal activity towards the gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli) and the yeasts  candida albicans and malassezia furfur. in addition, hbd-3 kills gram-positive bacteria such as streptococcus pyogenes or staphylococcus aureus, including multi-resistant s. aureus strains, and even vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium. in contrast to hbd-1 and hbd-2, significant expression of hbd-3 has been demonstrated in non-epithelial tissues, such as leukocytes, heart and skeletal muscle. hbd-4 is expressed in certain epithelia and in neutrophils. its bactericidal activity against p. aeruginosa is stronger than that of the other known beta-defensins. here we present an overview of human antimicrobial peptides with some emphasis on their antifungal properties.

TI  == production of interleukin (il)-10 and il-12 by murine colonic dendritic cells in  response to microbial stimuli.
AB  == intestinal dendritic cells (dc) are likely to regulate immunity to gut microflora, but little is known about their responses to bacterial antigens. therefore, dc from normal murine colon were characterized and their cytokine responses to components of gram-negative and/or gram-positive bacteria assessed.  cells were obtained by digestion of colonic tissue and contained dc that were identified by flow cytometry as cd11c(+) major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class ii(+) cells. purified dc were obtained by immunomagnetic separation plus cell sorting. dc had the morphology of immature myeloid cells, were endocytically active, expressed low levels of co-stimulatory molecules and stimulated a weak allogeneic mixed leucocyte reaction. analysis of flow cytometry data by a sensitive subtraction method allowed measurement of production of interleukin (il)-12 and il-10 by small numbers of gut dc by intracellular staining. fewer than 5% of unstimulated dc produced either il-10 or il-12. il-10 production was significantly up-regulated following stimulation with bifidobacteria longum, but  not after exposure to lipopolysaccharide (lps) or streptococcus faecium. in contrast, colonic dc produced il-12 in response to both lps and b.longum. thus, colonic dc can produce both il-12 and il-10 following bacterial stimulation. cell wall components from different bacteria stimulate distinct responses and may direct immune responses differentially in the gut.

TI  == surveillance of linezolid resistance in germany, 2001-2002.
AB  == a surveillance study was performed throughout germany from november 2001 to june  2002 to assess the prevalence of linezolid-resistant isolates among gram-positive bacteria from routine susceptibility data and to compare the in-vitro activity of linezolid to that of other antibacterial agents. each of 86 laboratories provided routine susceptibility data for 100 consecutive isolates. most laboratories (c. 60%) used the disk diffusion test. laboratories were also requested to send a representative sample of their isolates, as well as all isolates reported as intermediate or resistant to linezolid, to a reference laboratory for mic determination. susceptibility data for 8594 isolates were evaluated. sites of infection were skin and soft tissue (29.9%), upper and lower respiratory tract (19.1%), foreign body or catheter (10.5%), or urinary tract (9.8%). routine linezolid susceptibility data were reported for 6433 isolates. the prevalence of  linezolid resistance, as reported to the clinician, was 0.4% in staphylococcus aureus, 0.3% in staphylococcus epidermidis, 2.9% in enterococcus faecalis, 2.3% in enterococcus faecium, 1.4% in streptococcus pyogenes and 2.9% in streptococcus agalactiae. linezolid resistance was not detected in streptococcus pneumoniae or  in viridans group streptococci. sixty-nine of 115 isolates reported as intermediate or resistant to linezolid were retested, but none was resistant to linezolid. linezolid exhibited excellent in-vitro activity against representative isolates of the six most frequently encountered species (mic90, 1-2 mg/l). the prevalence of resistance to linezolid was very low in germany. organisms reported as linezolid-resistant should be retested, either in the same laboratory with an  alternative method or in a reference laboratory.

TI  == in vitro activities of tigecycline against clinical isolates from shanghai, china.
AB  == to evaluate the in vitro activity of tigecycline, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of tigecycline against 1,201 strains of recent clinical isolates from 10 hospitals in shanghai, china were determined and compared with selected comparators. results showed that tigecycline had broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. it was highly active against gram-positive cocci, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp., penicillin-intermediate streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. tigecycline also  had good activity against most strains of enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and moraxella catarrhalis. however, it was poorly active against acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa. tigecycline was highly active against anaerobic gram-positive cocci such as peptococcus spp. the in vitro activity of tigecycline was significantly better than that of minocycline and tetracycline. it was as active as or slightly more active than vancomycin and teicoplanin in the activity against resistant aerobic  gram-positive cocci. tigecycline was bactericidal against all gram-positive cocci tested except enterococcus spp. inoculum size but not ph of medium or concentration of human serum in broth had significant effect on the in vitro activity of tigecycline. aged media (48-72 hours after preparation) used in the test and specific resistance problem in china may have some effects on mic values of tigecycline.

TI  == potent antibacterial activity of halogenated compounds against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == common gram-positive clinical pathogens are showing an increasing trend for resistance to conventional antimicrobial agents. new drugs with potent antibacterial activities are urgently needed to remediate this problem. halogenated compounds isolated from several species of the red algae genus laurencia were examined for their antibacterial activity against 22 strains of human pathogenic bacteria, 7 strains of which were antibiotic-resistant bacteria. four phenolic sesquiterpenes and a polybrominated indole showed wide spectra of antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium (vre). in addition, laurinterol and allolaurinterol displayed potent bactericidal activity against three strains of mrsa at 3.13 microg ml(-1), and three strains of vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus, at 3.13 microg ml(-1) and 6.25 microg ml(-1), respectively.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of daptomycin against multidrug-resistant gram-positive strains collected worldwide.
AB  == daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide recently released for clinical use in the treatment of serious gram-positive infections in hospitalized patients. we evaluated the in vitro activity of daptomycin tested against recently isolated multidrug-resistant gram-positive clinical strains. a total of 386 isolates were  selected from a large collection of strains from more than 70 centers located in  europe, north america, and south america. the strains were tested by reference broth microdilution methods in mueller-hinton broth with 50 mg/l ca++ against daptomycin. daptomycin was the most potent compound tested against penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae with mic50/90 values at < or =0.12  and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. daptomycin was also highly active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci and staphylococcal strains with various resistance patterns. enterococcus faecium showed higher daptomycin mic values (mic90, 4 microg/ml) when compared to e. faecalis (mic90, 1 microg/ml). in summary, resistance to vancomycin, teicoplanin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, or penicillin among the gram-positive isolates did not adversely influence daptomycin activity. daptomycin showed a significant potency and spectrum against gram-positive species, including multidrug-resistant strains, and may represent a reasonable therapeutic option for infections caused by these important pathogens.

TI  == a new phenotype of resistance to lincosamide and streptogramin a-type antibiotics in streptococcus agalactiae in new zealand.
AB  == objectives: to characterize a new type of resistance to clindamycin in streptococcus agalactiae. methods: nineteen erythromycin-susceptible, clindamycin-resistant s. agalactiae isolates from new zealand were studied. mics  of macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin antibiotics were determined. clindamycin and streptogramin resistance genes were searched for by pcr. isolates were compared by serotyping and by dna macrorestriction patterns determined by pfge. conjugative transfer of resistance traits to recipient strains of s. agalactiae and enterococcus faecium was assayed. results: the 19 s. agalactiae isolates were intermediate or resistant to clindamycin (mic range: 0.5-2 mg/l) and lincomycin (mic range: 1-8 mg/l) and had high mics of dalfopristin (4-32 mg/l), a streptogramin a-type antibiotic, compared with controls. by contrast, the strains were susceptible to macrolides and quinupristin, a streptogramin b-type antibiotic. this new phenotype was called lsa (lincosamide-streptogramin a). clindamycin resistance could not be transferred to recipient strains. thirteen isolates belonged to serotype iii and to a single pfge genotype a, and five isolates belonged to serotype i and to genotype b. one isolate was non-typeable and belonged to a distinct genotype c. conclusions: we have characterized a new lsa phenotype in s. agalactiae. analysis of restriction patterns of s. agalactiae chromosomal dna showed that the resistance was spread in a minimum of three bacterial clones. the genetic and biochemical basis for the resistance remains unknown.

TI  == alkali-resistant bacteria in root canal systems.
AB  == the aim of this study was to isolate and identify alkali-resistant bacteria from  the dentin of infected root canals. bacteria from homogenized dentin powder made  up from infected root canal walls from human teeth were cultured on buffer-enriched brain heart infusion agar supplemented with 4% sheep blood (bhi-blood agar), adjusted to ph 7.0, 9.0 or 10.0. incubation took place for 7 days at 37 degrees c in an anaerobic glove box. bacterial strains selected according to colony and morphology were subcultured in buffer-enriched bhi broth  adjusted to ph 9.0, 10.0 or 11.0 to confirm their growth as alkali-resistant bacteria. polymerase chain reaction amplification using specific primer sets and  16s rdna sequence analysis was performed for identification of alkali-resistant isolates. in the present study, 37 teeth extracted from 37 patients were used for preparation of the dentin powder samples. bacteria were detected in 25 samples when standard bhi-blood agars (ph 7.0) were used. of these, 29 strains from 15 samples were alkali resistant, 25 strains growing at ph 9.0 and 4 at ph 10.0. the alkali-resistant strains included enterococcus faecium (10 strains) and enterococcus faecalis (2 strains), enterobacter cancerogenus (1 strains), fusobacterium nucleatum (1 strains), klebsiella ornithinolytica (2 strains), lactobacillus rhamnosus (2 strains), streptococcus anginosus (2 strains), streptococcus constellatus (3 strains), and streptococcus mitis (2 strains). three strains were also identified as bacteria of genus firmicutes or staphylococcus at the genus level. the present study showed that many bacterial species in infected root canal dentin were alkali-resistant at ph 9.0 and/or ph 10.0, and belonged mainly to the genus enterococcus.

TI  == susceptibility to quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid in 839 clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci from norway.
AB  == a total of 839 clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci from norway including staphylococcus aureus (n = 214), coagulase negative staphylococcus spp. (n = 100), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 99), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 80), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 127), streptococcus spp. viridans group (n = 70), enterococcus faecalis (n = 75), and enterococcus faecium (n = 74), were tested by e-test for susceptibility to a range of antimicrobials including the novel antibiotics quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid. subgroups of oxacillin resistant s. aureus and coagulase negative staphylococcus spp., penicillin non-susceptible s. pneumoniae and vancomycin resistant enterococcus spp. were specifically included as they are the intended targets for these new drugs. all isolates were susceptible to linezolid (mic5o and mic9o 0.25-2.0 mg/l, mic range  0.12-2 mg/l). staphylococcal and streptococcal isolates were also susceptible to  quinupristin-dalfopristin except for some intermediately susceptible viridans group isolates (mic54, and mic90 0.25-2 mg/l, mic range 0.125-2 mg/l). enterococcus faecium (mic90 = 4.0 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (mic50 = 8.0 mg/l, mic90 > or = 32 mg/l) were less susceptible to this substance. there was no linkage between reduced susceptibility to linezolid or quinupristin-dalfopristin  and resistance to other classes of antimicrobials. the study demonstrated a high  prevalence of in vitro susceptibility to linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin, which is necessary for their use in the treatment of infections with resistant gram-positive pathogens. the results were used to evaluate the appropriateness of breakpoints and to define a baseline for monitoring possible future emergence of  resistance to quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid in norway.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from aoc salers cheese.
AB  == the objective of this work was to describe the diversity of lactic acid bacteria  in traditional raw milk salers cheeses at the species and strain levels. the characterization of 381 strains isolated during ripening and various strain collections was investigated using physiological analysis and molecular techniques: rep-pcr, species and genus specific amplifications and the sequence analysis of 16s rdna for strain typing and taxonomic identification. the strains  belonged to lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garviae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus millieri, streptococcus macedonicus and pediococcus pentosaceus. a  wide phenotypic and genomic heterogeneity was observed within the different species (lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei and leuconostoc mesenteroides) according to the origin and the time of ripening. the natural microflora was different from strain collection and each method must be combined  to identify and characterize natural microflora. this study revealed the low selectivity of selective media used for the isolation of different groups of lactic acid bacteria except the facultatively heterofermentative lactobacilli medium selecting mesophile lactobacilli and sb medium selective for enterococcus. the study reveals, for the first time, the microbial lactic acid bacteria community of salers cheese and its diversity. a better knowledge of microbial flora will be useful to improve understanding of sensory quality of cheeses.

TI  == identification and characterization of the novel lysm domain-containing surface protein sep from lactobacillus fermentum br11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in lactobacillus and lactococcus.
AB  == examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of lactobacillus fermentum br11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kda  protein termed sep. the amino-terminal sequence of sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of lactobacillus reuteri, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and lactobacillus plantarum. the carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (apf) surface proteins of lactobacillus gasseri and  lactobacillus johnsonii. the mature amino terminus of sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding lysm domain, thereby making it distinct from apf proteins.  we have identified a common motif within lysm domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding yg motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in l. fermentum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactococcus lactis mg1363. modified sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, and l. lactis hosts. sep as well as the previously described surface protein bspa were used to express and secrete in l.  fermentum or l. rhamnosus a fragment of human e-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for listeria monocytogenes. this study demonstrates that sep has  potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from blood cultures of hospitalized patients in the united states in 2002.
AB  == background: bloodstream infections are associated with significant patient morbidity and mortality. antimicrobial susceptibility patterns should guide the choice of empiric antimicrobial regimens for patients with bacteremia. methods: from january to december of 2002, 82,569 bacterial blood culture isolates were reported to the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa by 268 laboratories. susceptibility to relevant antibiotic compounds was analyzed using national committee for clinical laboratory standards guidelines. results: coagulase-negative staphylococci (42.0%), staphylococcus aureus (16.5%), enterococcus faecalis (8.3%), escherichia coli (7.2%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3.6%), and enterococcus faecium (3.5%) were the most frequently isolated bacteria from blood cultures, collectively accounting for >80% of isolates. in vitro susceptibility to expanded-spectrum beta-lactams such as ceftriaxone were high for oxacillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (98.7%), oxacillin-susceptible s. aureus (99.8%), e. coli (97.3%), k. pneumoniae (93.3%),  and streptococcus pneumoniae (97.2%). susceptibilities to fluoroquinolones were variable for k. pneumoniae (90.3-91.4%), e. coli (86.0-86.7%), oxacillin-susceptible s. aureus (84.0-89.4%), oxacillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (72.7-82.7%), e. faecalis (52.1%), and e. faecium (11.3%). combinations of antimicrobials are often prescribed as empiric therapy for bacteremia. susceptibilities of all blood culture isolates to one or  both agents in combinations of ceftriaxone, ceftazdime, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam or ciprofloxacin plus gentamicin were consistent (range,  74.8-76.3%) but lower than similar beta-lactam or ciprofloxacin combinations with vancomycin (range, 93.5-96.6%). conclusion: ongoing surveillance for antimicrobial susceptibility remains essential, and will enhance efforts to identify resistance and attempt to limit its spread.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of the pathogens of bacteraemia in the uk and ireland 2001-2002: the bsac bacteraemia resistance surveillance programme.
AB  == objectives: to describe the current patterns of antimicrobial resistance in the major pathogens of bacteraemia in the uk and ireland, to highlight any unexpected resistance patterns and to act as a reference baseline for future studies. methods: in 2001 and 2002, 5092 blood culture isolates were collected by 29 laboratories distributed across the uk and ireland. a single central laboratory re-identified the isolates and measured mics by the bsac agar dilution method. results: oxacillin resistance was found in 42% of staphylococcus aureus and 76% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. streptococci were generally susceptible to beta-lactams, but tetracycline resistance was common (except in streptococcus pneumoniae) and particularly common among group b isolates (82% resistant). nine  percent of s. pneumoniae had reduced susceptibility to penicillin (mics 0.12-1 mg/l), but none required >/=2 mg/l for inhibition. high-level gentamicin resistance was seen in 43% of enterococcus faecalis, often in combination with raised ciprofloxacin mics (>/=32 mg/l), but these isolates remained susceptible to ampicillin and imipenem. only linezolid and tigecycline showed in vitro potency against a large proportion of enterococcus faecium. vancomycin resistance was restricted to enterococci (20% of e. faecium, 3% of e. faecalis) and a single isolate of coagulase-negative staphylococci (0.2%, mic of 8 mg/l). escherichia coli isolates were commonly resistant to amoxicillin (56%) and tetracycline (88%) but remained susceptible to ceftazidime, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in 2% of e. coli (none in 2001, 3.2% in 2002), 5% of klebsiella spp. and 8% of enterobacter spp. resistance rates of pseudomonas aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, gentamicin, imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam were between 4% and 7%. among the newly licensed and developmental agents, there was no resistance to linezolid in gram-positive organisms. ertapenem had a wide spectrum, covering enterobacteriaceae, streptococci and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci. mics of tigecycline were low for gram-positive species and enterobacteriaceae except proteeae and enterobacter spp. conclusion: antimicrobial resistance among major bloodstream pathogens to those antimicrobials often selected for empirical therapy was relatively uncommon in 2001-2002, usually <10%. an important exception was oxacillin resistance in s. aureus.

TI  == indigenous raw milk microbiota influences the bacterial development in traditional cheese from an alpine natural park.
AB  == nostrano di primiero is a 6-month ripened cheese produced from raw milk collected in the paneveggio-pale di san martino natural park area in the italian dolomites. in summer, this cheese is made using milk collected from two different areas, passo rolle and vanoi, in the paneveggio natural park. during the experiment, the milk from the two areas was separately processed, and cheeses were made in the same cheese factory using the same technological process. the microbiota of raw milk and cheeses of the two areas was isolated and the dominant population was monitored by rapd analysis and identified by 16s rrna sequence. the milk of the passo rolle area was mainly composed of mesophilic strains, thermophilic streptococcus thermophilus, and low amounts of enterococci were also found; the milk of the vanoi area was dominated by mesophilic microbiota mostly lactococcus  lactis ssp. cremoris and ssp. lactis and lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei.  the plating of the natural starter culture revealed the presence of a relevant community of thermophilic cocci and lower amounts of enterococci. the dynamic population analysis showed the importance of the natural starter culture in the first 2 days of cheese ripening in both cheeses. moreover, the large biodiversity observed in the raw milks was also detected in the cheeses during ripening. the vanoi cheese was dominated by enterococcus faecium and streptococcus macedonicus  in the first two days and mesophilic 21 lb. paracasei ssp. paracasei became the most represented population after 15 days of ripening. in the first few days, the rolle cheese was characterized by being mainly composed of thermophilic s. macedonicus and s. thermophilus and secondarily by mesophilic cocci. during ripening, the microbiota composition changed, and at 15 days, mesophilic lactobacilli were the dominant population, but later, this was mainly composed of mesophilic cocci and lactobacilli. the taxonomical identification by 16s rrna sequence confirmed a large biodiversity related to raw milk microbiota and only five strains of s. macedonicus, lactobacillus plantarum, 21 lb. paracasei ssp. paracasei, lactobacillus fermentum and e. faecium were detected in both cheeses.

TI  == algorithm for the identification of bacterial pathogens in positive blood cultures by real-time lightcycler polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with sequence-specific probes.
AB  == we developed real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays for rapid detection of the most common and clinically relevant bacteria in positive blood culture bottles, including staphylococcus spp., s. epidermidis, s. aureus, enterococcus spp. (including differentiation of e. faecalis and e. faecium), streptococcus spp., streptococcus agalactiae, enterobacteriaceae, e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter spp., bacteroides spp., haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. a total of 507 positive blood cultures were investigated according to a specific pcr algorithm based on the microscopic result of the blood culture, and the pcr results were compared to the culture results. apart from-cross reactions between e. coli and chryseomonas luteola and enterococcus faecium and e. durans, the pcr assay correctly identified all bacteria in the blood cultures and did not show any false-positive results. regarding blood cultures positive with a single species of bacteria (n = 474), 98.3% of all bacteria were correctly detected by the pcr algorithm within a few hours. however, in mixed infections, the sensitivity was lower. the pcr algorithm is well suited for rapid identification of the most common bacteria in  positive blood cultures.

TI  == comparative study of the in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, abt-492.
AB  == objectives: the in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, abt-492, was determined. methods: mics were compared with those of two beta-lactams, telithromycin, ciprofloxacin and four later generation fluoroquinolones. the effects of human serum and of inoculum concentration were also investigated. results: mic data indicate that abt-492 has potent activity against gram-positive organisms with enhanced anti-staphylococcal activity compared with earlier fluoroquinolones, in addition to activity against beta-haemolytic streptococci, pneumococci including penicillin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococcus faecalis but not enterococcus  faecium. abt-492 was the most active agent tested against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria meningitidis, fluoroquinolone-susceptible neisseria gonorrhoeae and anaerobes. good activity was observed for abt-492 amongst the enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes tested, but ciprofloxacin showed superior activity for species of proteus, morganella and providencia, as well as  for pseudomonas spp. in common with the other fluoroquinolones tested, organisms  with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin had raised mic(90)s to abt-492. the  one isolate of h. influenzae tested with reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility had an abt-492 mic close to that of the population lacking a mechanism of quinolone resistance. abt-492 was more active than ciprofloxacin against chlamydia spp. an inoculum effect was observed with a number of isolates of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, e. faecium, klebsiella spp. and  escherichia coli, in addition to moderately raised mics in the presence of 70% serum protein. the clinical significance of these findings is yet to be determined. conclusions: abt-492 is a new fluoroquinolone with excellent activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, with many potential clinical uses.

AB  == background and objective: although probiotics are not new, 5 new commercially available products have been launched onto the south african market in the last 2 years. evaluations of products in the usa and europe shown poor correlation between label claims and actual contents. we undertook an evaluation of 9 products currently available on the shelves in south africa. methods and analysis: an independent laboratory was used. a culture method involving serial dilutions on selective media was used to obtain a colony count per gram for indicated organisma. a non-culture method, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), was used to determined the organisms present in the products. results: disturbingly, we found a relatively poor correlation between the advertised and determined bacterial content. only 3 of the 9 products tested  contained the bacteria indicated on the label and 5 products contained sufficient bacteria for a probiotic effect. the enterococcus faecium, a potential pathogen and saccharomyces cerevisiae found in 2 of the products are of concern. conclusion: this evaluation confirms that the contents of several probiotics available in south africa do not correspond to the label claims. this is of concern as clinical efficacy is dependent on strain specificity and organism numbers. current regulatory requirements do not address this discrepancy. as such, we recommend that commercially available probiotic products be screened annually and the results of such quality control measures be made available to the medicines control council (mcc).

TI  == activity of linezolid against gram-positive cocci isolated in french hospitals as determined by three in-vitro susceptibility testing methods.
AB  == in total, 844 strains of gram-positive cocci were collected from six university hospitals in france between september 1999 and january 2000. mics of linezolid were determined: (i) for all strains by agar dilution (method a); (ii) by broth microdilution (method b) for staphylococci and enterococci; (iii) by etest (method e) for beta-haemolytic streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae. susceptibility to other antibiotics was determined by the disk diffusion method.  mic50 and mic90 values were identical (2 mg/l) for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (n = 179) by methods a and b. linezolid was active against  methicillin-resistant s. aureus (n = 117), with an mic90 of 2 mg/l (methods a and b), but with a lower mic50 of 1 mg/l by method a. of the 200 coagulase-negative staphylococci, 56.5% were methicillin-resistant and 43.5% were methicillin-susceptible. linezolid had similar in-vitro activity by methods a and b (mic50 and mic90 values of 1-2 mg/l), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility. the mic90 of linezolid for all enterococci (150 enterococcus faecalis and 50 enterococcus faecium) was 2 mg/l by both methods. mics of linezolid for beta-haemolytic streptococci had a narrow range of 0.5-2 mg/l (method a) and 0.125-2 mg/l (method e). pneumococci (n = 118), including 67 penicillin g-intermediate and -resistant strains, were all inhibited by linezolid 2 mg/l (mic90 of 2 mg/l by methods a and e). no strain had an mic of > 2 mg/l by  agar dilution or etest, or of > 4 mg/l by broth microdilution. overall, the study confirmed the good in-vitro activity of linezolid and the very narrow range of mics for gram-positive cocci susceptible or resistant to other antibiotics, irrespective of the method used.

TI  == [nationwide sensitivity surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antibiotics against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--the first ciproxan iv special investigation in 2001].
AB  == the parenteral injection of ciprofloxacin (cpfx), a fluoroquinolone antimicrobial drug, was approved in september 2000 and a re-examination period of 6 years was set at that time. as a special investigation to apply for re-examination of this  drug, it has been planned to conduct 3 nationwide surveillances during the re-examination period by collecting clinically isolated bacteria from patients with severe infections, to whom the drug was mainly indicated, and examining drug susceptibilities of the bacteria to various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including cpfx. this time, we determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including cpfx against 1,220 strains isolated from patients with severe infections by the micro-liquid dilution method and compared susceptibilities of various clinically isolated bacteria to cpfx with those to other antimicrobial drugs. gram-positive bacteria  were less susceptible to cpfx than to carbapenems except 2 bacterial species, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus avium but susceptibilities of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), staphylococcus epidermidis  and enterococcus faecalis to cpfx were comparable to those to cefozopran. susceptibility of streptococcus pneumoniae to cpfx did not differ among ampicillin (abpc)-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic of abpc: < 0.25 microgram/ml), abpc-intermediate s. pneumoniae (mic of abpc: 0.25-2 micrograms/ml) and abpc-resistant s. pneumoniae (mic of abpc: > or = 4 micrograms/ml) mic90 of cpfx: 1 microgram/ml) and a decrease in the antimicrobial activity seen among cephem and carbapenem antimicrobial drugs against penicillin-intermediate strains was not noted with cpfx. gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to cpfx similarly to carbapenems and the mic90 values of cpfx were in the range from < or = 0.063 to 2 micrograms/ml against strains except stenotrophomonas maltophilia and burkholderia cepacia. pseudomonas aeruginosa was most susceptible to cpfx among the antibacterial drugs examined and the mic90 was 2 micrograms/ml. cpfx also showed the lowest mic90 value (0.5 microgram/ml) against beta-lactam-resistant p. aeruginosa among the drugs examined. when extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production and class b beta-lactamase production were examined in 439 strains of enterobacteriaceae and 168 strains of  glucose non-fermentative bacteria out of the gram-negative bacteria collected this time, 3 strains (0.49%) producing esbl and 7 strains (1.15%) producing class b beta-lactamase were found. the mic range of cpfx to these 10 strains was between < or = 0.063 to 8 micrograms/ml and 5 strains among those showed susceptibilities (mic of cpfx: 1 microgram/ml) based on the nccls breakpoint. cpfx also showed a satisfactory result concerning susceptibilities of major causal bacteria based on the report of the committee of japan society of chemotherapy on the standard method for determination of susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, the breakpoint of pneumonia. furthermore, susceptibilities  of various bacteria isolated clinically from patients with severe infections this time did not differ much from the result of the nationwide surveillance which we  conducted in 1997. thus, it was concluded that the antimicrobial activity of cpfx was maintained in the post-marketing surveillance for its parenteral preparation.

AB  == the in vitro activity of abt773, a new ketolide, was assessed against a collection (518) of well-characterised gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens  and compared with that of other appropriate drugs. abt773 was active (mic-90=0.03 mg/l) against the staphylococci tested which included macrolide-resistant but clindamycin susceptible organisms. streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae were also inhibited (mic-90 range: <0.0075-0.5mg/l) irrespective of their antibiotic resistance phenotype. enterococcus faecalis was sensitive to abt773 with the exception of vana mutants. e. faecium showed poor susceptibility  to abt773. the activity of the new ketolide against haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis was comparable with that of the most potent drugs tested. abt773 displays the characteristics of a promising agent that deserves to be introduced as the empirical therapy of infections caused by the bacterial species tested here, even if they are multiply resistant.

TI  == in vivo pharmacodynamic activity of daptomycin.
AB  == daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibiotic with activity against a wide range of gram-positive bacteria. we used the neutropenic murine thigh model to characterize the pharmacodynamics of daptomycin. icr/swiss mice were rendered neutropenic with cyclophosphamide; and the thigh muscles of the mice were infected with strains of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecium. animals were treated by subcutaneous injection of daptomycin at doses of 0.20 to 400 mg/kg of body weight/day divided into one, two, four, or eight doses over 24 h. daptomycin exhibited linear pharmacokinetics, with an area under the concentration-time curve (auc) from time zero to infinity/dose of 9.4 and a half-life of 0.9 to 1.4 h. the level of protein binding was 90%. free daptomycin exhibited concentration-dependent killing and produced in vivo postantibiotic effects (paes) of 4.8 to 10.8 h. nonlinear regression analysis was used to determine which pharmacokinetic (pk) or pharmacodynamic (pd) parameter was important for efficacy by using free drug concentrations. the peak concentration/mic (peak/mic) ratio and 24-h auc/mic ratio were the pk and pd parameters that best correlated with in vivo efficacy (r(2) = 83 to 87% for peak/mic and r(2) = 86% for the auc/mic ratio, whereas r(2) = 47 to 50% for the time that the concentration was greater than the mic) against standard strains of s. aureus and s. pneumoniae. the peak/mic ratios required for a bacteriostatic effect ranged from 12 to 36 for s. pneumoniae, 59 to 94 for s. aureus, and 0.14 to 0.25 for e. faecium. the auc/mic ratios needed for a bacteriostatic effect ranged from 75 to 237 for s. pneumoniae, 388 to 537 for s.  aureus, and 0.94 to 1.67 for e. faecium. the free daptomycin concentrations needed to average from one to two times the mic over 24 h to produce a bacteriostatic effect and two to four times the mic over 24 h to produce greater  than 99% killing. the long pae and potent bactericidal activity make daptomycin an attractive option for the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == in vitro activities of the novel cephalosporin lb 11058 against multidrug-resistant staphylococci and streptococci.
AB  == lb 11058 is a novel parenteral cephalosporin with a c-3 pyrimidinyl-substituted vinyl sulfide group and a c-7 2-amino-5-chloro-1,3-thiazole group. this study evaluated the in vitro activity and spectrum of lb 11058 against 1,245 recent clinical isolates, including a subset of gram-positive strains with specific resistant phenotypes. lb 11058 was very active against streptococcus pneumoniae.  the novel cephalosporin was 8- to 16-fold more potent than ceftriaxone, cefepime, or amoxicillin-clavulanate against both penicillin-intermediate and -resistant s. pneumoniae. lb 11058 was also very active against both beta-hemolytic streptococci (mic at which 90% of isolates were inhibited [mic(90)], </=0.008 micro g/ml) and viridans group streptococci (mic(90), 0.03 to 0.5 micro g/ml), including penicillin-resistant strains. among oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, lb 11058 mic results varied from 0.06 to 0.25 micro g/ml (mic(50), 0.12 micro g/ml), while among oxacillin-resistant strains lb 11058 mics varied from 0.25 to 1 micro g/ml (mic(50), 1 micro g/ml). coagulase-negative staphylococci showed an lb 11058 susceptibility pattern similar to that of s. aureus, with all isolates being inhibited at </=1 micro g/ml. lb 11058 also showed reasonable in vitro activity against enterococcus faecalis, including vancomycin-resistant strains (mic(50), 1 micro g/ml), and bacillus spp. (mic(50), 0.25 micro g/ml); however, it was less active against enterococcus faecium (mic(50), >64 micro g/ml) and corynebacterium spp. (mic(50), 32 micro g/ml). against gram-negative pathogens, lb 11058 showed activity against haemophilus influenzae (mic(90), 0.25 to 0.5 micro g/ml) and moraxella catarrhalis (mic(90),  0.25 micro g/ml), with mics not influenced by beta-lactamase production. in conclusion, lb 11058 demonstrated a broad antibacterial spectrum and was highly active against gram-positive bacteria, particularly against multidrug-resistant staphylococci and streptococci.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--i. gram-positive bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial susceptibility for czop were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen species (2,363 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the  clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis  (msse), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus saprophyticus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp), streptococcus milleri group and peptostreptococcus spp. the antibacterial activity of czop either against mssa or msse was preferable (mic90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/ml) and comparable to those of other cephems. czop was also effective  on mrse (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) but not on mrsa. czop and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop  against e. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (cpr; mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) and higher than those of other cephems. no antibacterial activity  of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, like other drugs. the antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and cpr (mic90: < or = 0.063 microgram/ml), and, against s. agalactiae,  was also preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml). czop indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against pssp, pisp, or prsp (mic90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. milleri group was also preferable, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint mic of czop was 95.9% in mrsa, 93.5% in prsp, 63.3% in pisp, 35.8% in s. haemolyticus, 27.9% in e. faecalis, and 13.3% mrse. those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (cfpm), but e. faecalis showed 91.2% for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. in correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of prsp was not inhibited at breakpoint mic either czop or  cfpm while 69.2% at breakpoint mic either czop or ceftazidime. in conclusion, the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. a decline in the sensitivities of s. saprophyticus, s. milleri group, pisp, and prsp to czop, however, was suggested.

TI  == [activities of antimicrobial agents against 8,474 clinical isolates obtained from 37 medical institutions during 2000 in japan].
AB  == a survey was conducted to determine the antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial agents against 8,474 clinical isolates obtained from 37 japanese medical institutions in 2000. a total of 25 antimicrobial agents were used, comprising 4 fluoroquinolones, 13 beta-lactams, minocycline, chloramphenicol, clarithromycin, azithromycin, gentamicin, amikacin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and vancomycin. a high resistance rate of over 85% against fluoroquinolones was exhibited by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococcus faecium. isolates showing resistance to fluoroquinolones among methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa from uti accounted for 30-60%.  however, many of the common pathogens were still susceptible to fluoroquinolones, such as streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-resistant isolates), streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, moraxella catarrhalis,  the enterobacteriaceae family, and haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant isolates). about 85% of p. aeruginosa isolated from rti were susceptible to fluoroquinolones. in conclusion, this survey of sensitivity to antimicrobial agents clearly indicated trend for increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones among mrsa, enterococci, and p. aeruginosa isolated from uti, although fluoroquinolones are still effective against other organisms and p. aeruginosa from rti as has been demonstrated in previous studies.

TI  == heat shock treatment increases the frequency of loss of an erythromycin resistance-encoding transposable element from the chromosome of lactobacillus crispatus chcc3692.
AB  == a 3,165-bp chromosomally integrated transposon, designatedtn3692, of the gram-positive strain lactobacillus crispatus chcc3692 contains an erm(b) gene conferring resistance to erythromycin at concentrations of up to 250 micrograms/ml. loss of this resistance can occur spontaneously, but the rate is substantially increased by heat shock treatment. heat shock treatment at 60 degrees c resulted in an almost 40-fold increase in the frequency of erythromycin-sensitive cells (erythromycin mic, 0.047 micrograms/ml). the phenotypic change was followed by a dramatic increase in transcription of the transposase gene and the concomitant loss of an approximately 2-kb dna fragment carrying the erm(b) gene from the 3,165-bp erm transposon. in cells that were not subjected to heat shock, transcription of the transposase gene was not detectable. the upstream sequence of the transposase gene did not show any homology to known heat shock promoters in the gene data bank. significant homology (>99%) was observed between the erythromycin resistance-encoding gene from l. crispatus chcc3692 and the erm(b) genes from other gram-positive bacteria, such as streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus  faecium, and lactobacillus reuteri, which strongly indicates a common origin of the erm(b) gene for these species. the transposed dna element was not translocated to other parts of the genome of chcc3692, as determining by southern blotting, pcr analysis, and dna sequencing. no other major aberrations were observed, as judged by colony morphology, growth performance of the strain, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. these observations suggest that heat shock treatment could be used as a tool for the removal of unwanted antibiotic resistance genes harbored in transposons flanked by insertion sequence elements or transposases in lactic acid bacteria used for animal and human food production.

AB  == bal9141 has been reported to have inhibitory activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), many enterococci, and streptococci with various resistant patterns. bal9141 potency was assessed by time-kill curves alone or with subinhibitory concentrations of gentamicin (mic/4). bal9141 exhibited bactericidal activity alone against all the streptococci and staphylococci. among ampicillin-susceptible enterococci, bal9141 was bactericidal against some strains, but no bal9141 inhibition was observed of  ampicillin-resistant enterococcus faecium. the activity of bal9141 with gentamicin was slightly enhanced (not synergy) or indifferent against staphylococci. bal9141 demonstrated bactericidal action alone against enterococcus faecalis and some e. faecium strains (-4.8 to -6.0 log10 cfu/ml), but static effects were also noted. drug interactions with gentamicin showed early synergy (4-8 h) for all enterococci, and indifference or synergy at 24 h (no antagonism). bal9141 (< or = 8 mg/l) showed promising bactericidal activity alone and synergy with gentamicin against some of the vancomycin-resistant enterococci tested.

TI  == molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pre25 of enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  == plasmid pre25 from enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to e. faecalis jh2-2, lactococcus lactis bu2, and listeria innocua l19. its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the  largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (plasmid 46 (2001) 170). the gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pip501 of streptococcus agalactiae. erythromycin resistance is due to a 23s ribosomal rna methyl transferase, again as found in pip501 (ermb). the aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon tn5405 of staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. aureus, campylobacter coli, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium difficile. pre25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pip501. of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsb, trac, trsf, trsj, and trsl). the enterococcal part is joined into the pip501 part by insertion elements is1216v of e. faecium tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of is1062 (e. faecalis) and is1485 (e. faecium). pre25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.

TI  == discovery of a small molecule that inhibits cell division by blocking ftsz, a novel therapeutic target of antibiotics.
AB  == the emergence of bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a major health problem and, therefore, it is critical to develop new antibiotics with novel modes of action. ftsz, a tubulin-like gtpase, plays an essential role in bacterial cell division, and its homologs are present in almost all eubacteria and archaea. during cell division, ftsz forms polymers in the presence of gtp that recruit other division proteins to make the cell division apparatus. therefore, inhibition of ftsz polymerization will prevent cells from dividing, leading to cell death. using a fluorescent ftsz polymerization assay, the screening of >100,000 extracts of microbial fermentation broths and plants followed by fractionation led to the identification of viriditoxin, which blocked ftsz polymerization with an ic50 of 8.2 microg/ml and concomitant gtpase inhibition with an ic50 of 7.0 microg/ml. that the mode of antibacterial action of viriditoxin is via inhibition of ftsz was confirmed by the observation of its effects on cell morphology, macromolecular synthesis, dna-damage response, and increased minimum inhibitory concentration as a result of an increase in the expression of the ftsz protein. viriditoxin exhibited broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against clinically relevant gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, without affecting the viability of eukaryotic cells.

TI  == an enterococcus faecium secreted antigen, saga, exhibits broad-spectrum binding to extracellular matrix proteins and appears essential for e. faecium growth.
AB  == a gene encoding a major secreted antigen, saga, was identified in enterococcus faecium by screening an e. faecium genomic expression library with sera from patients with e. faecium-associated endocarditis. recombinant saga protein showed broad-spectrum binding to extracellular matrix (ecm) proteins, including fibrinogen, collagen type i, collagen type iv, fibronectin, and laminin. a fibrinogen-binding protein, purified from culture supernatants of an e. faecium clinical isolate, was found to match the n-terminal sequence of the predicted saga protein and to react with the anti-saga antibody, confirming that it was the saga protein; this protein appeared as an 80- to 90-kda smear on a western blot that was sensitive to proteinase k and resistant to periodate treatment and glycoprotein staining. when overexpressed in e. faecium and escherichia coli, the native and recombinant saga proteins formed stable oligomers, apparently via their c-terminal domains. the saga protein is composed of three domains: (i) a putative coiled-coil n-terminal domain that shows homology to the n-terminal domain of streptococcus mutans saga protein (42% similarity), previously shown to be involved in cell wall integrity and cell shape maintenance, and to the p45 protein of listeria monocytogenes (41% similarity); (ii) a central domain containing direct repeats; and (iii) a c-terminal domain that is similar to that  found in various proteins, including p45 (50% similarity) and p60 (52% similarity) of l. monocytogenes. the p45 and p60 proteins both have cell wall hydrolase activity, and the latter has also been shown to be involved in virulence, whereas cell wall hydrolase activity was not detected for saga protein. the e. faecium saga gene, like the s. mutans homologue, is located in a  cluster of genes encoding proteins that appear to be involved in cell wall metabolism and could not be disrupted unless it was first transcomplemented, suggesting that the saga gene is essential for e. faecium growth and may be involved in cell wall metabolism. in conclusion, the extracelluar e. faecium saga protein is apparently essential for growth, shows broad-spectrum binding to ecm proteins, forms oligomers, and is antigenic during infection.

TI  == bacterial community dynamics during production of registered designation of origin salers cheese as evaluated by 16s rrna gene single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis.
AB  == microbial dynamics during processing and ripening of traditional cheeses such as  registered designation of origin salers cheese, an artisanal cheese produced in france, play an important role in the elaboration of sensory qualities. the aim of the present study was to obtain a picture of the dynamics of the microbial ecosystem of rdo salers cheese by using culture-independent methods. this included dna extraction, pcr, and single-strand conformation polymorphism (sscp)  analysis. bacterial and high-gc% gram-positive bacterial primers were used to amplify v2 or v3 regions of the 16s rrna gene. sscp patterns revealed changes during the manufacturing of the cheese. patterns of the ecosystems of cheeses that were provided by three farmers were also quite different. cloning and sequencing of the 16s rrna gene revealed sequences related to lactic acid bacteria (lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus pentosus), which were predominant during manufacturing and ripening. bacteria belonging to the high-gc% gram-positive group (essentially corynebacteria) were found by using specific primers. the present molecular approach can effectively describe the ecosystem of artisanal dairy products.

TI  == enterococcus phoeniculicola sp. nov., a novel member of the enterococci isolated  from the uropygial gland of the red-billed woodhoopoe, phoeniculus purpureus.
AB  == a facultatively anaerobic, gram-positive, coccoid, non-spore-forming, non-motile, catalase-negative bacterium was isolated from the uropygial (preen) gland of wild red-billed woodhoopoes (phoeniculus purpureus) and designated strain jlb-1(t). physiological and biochemical testing suggested that this homofermentative, lactic-acid-producing bacterium could belong to the genus enterococcus or the genus streptococcus. comparison of the 16s rrna gene sequence of strain jlb-1(t)  with other 16s rdna sequences in the genbank database by blast analysis showed that its closest relatives are enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium and enterococcus asini. strain jlb-1(t) may be differentiated from these species by the fact that it does not produce acid from lactose, d-mannitol, d(+)-melezitose  or d-sorbitol. furthermore, it does not hydrolyse arginine or hippurate and cannot grow in the presence of 6.5% nacl or 40% bile. it differs from the streptococci in that it does not lyse erythrocytes. strain jlb-1(t) is a novel member of the enterococci, for which the name enterococcus phoeniculicola sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain is jlb-1(t) (=atcc baa-412(t) = dsm 14726(t)).

TI  == linezolid resistance since 2001: sentry antimicrobial surveillance program.
AB  == background: the oxazolidinone class of antimicrobials has demonstrated remarkable activity against gram-positive cocci. linezolid has proven to be a first-line therapeutic option for vancomycin-resistant strains. linezolid clinical trial results and subsequent published case reports cite rare resistance emerging in patients receiving prolonged therapy. objective: to report the initial linezolid-resistant organisms from cases obtained through the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, after screening >40,000 gram-positive cocci without resistance between 1998 and 2000. methods: during 2001-2002, 8 resistant  strains (from 8 different patients) located in 6 states from 7 different participating sentry institutions in the us were identified among bloodstream, respiratory, skin and soft tissue, and urinary tract infection isolates of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus oralis. resistance was detected by reference broth microdilution methods and confirmed by identical results using etest (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) and the standardized disk diffusion method. results: minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and disk diffusion tests showed elevated mics (> or =8 microg/ml) and small inhibitory zone diameters (< or =15 mm) for all strains to both linezolid and the investigational oxazolidinone azd2563. vancomycin resistance was detected in 2 of the 8 linezolid-resistant strains. all enterococci and the viridans-group streptococcus (s. oralis) strain showed resistance to erythromycin. e. faecium strains were resistant to penicillins, but susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin. only 3 of the patients had previously received the drug. conclusions: linezolid resistance remains rare, with only 8 isolates among 9833 (0.08%) monitored isolates identified between january 1, 2001, and june 30, 2002. resistance, however, was no longer limited to enterococci. clinical laboratories should test linezolid more widely to detect emerging resistance, especially for patients receiving oxazolidinone therapy. longitudinal surveillance programs are warranted to detect a trend in the development of resistance, determine the molecular mechanism of resistance, and recommend alternative therapies or epidemiologic interventions.

TI  == in vitro activities of linezolid combined with other antimicrobial agents against staphylococci, enterococci, pneumococci, and selected gram-negative organisms.
AB  == the activities of linezolid, an oxazolidinone antibacterial agent active against  gram-positive organisms, alone and in combination with 35 antimicrobial agents were tested in vitro against methicillin-sensitive (n = 1 to 2 strains) and methicillin-resistant (n = 8 to 10) staphylococcus aureus strains; vancomycin-sensitive (n = 6) and vancomycin-resistant (n = 6 to 8) enterococcus faecalis strains; vancomycin-sensitive (n = 5) and vancomycin-resistant (n = 6) enterococcus faecium strains; penicillin-sensitive (n = 2 to 5), penicillin-intermediate (n = 5 to 6), and penicillin-resistant (n = 5 to 6) streptococcus pneumoniae strains; escherichia coli (n = 6); and klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 6). the fractional inhibitory concentration indices of linezolid  in combination with other antimicrobial agents for the organisms tested were generated on checkerboard broth microdilution plates prepared by a semiautomated  method. of 1,380 organism-drug combinations, 1,369 (99.2%) combinations of linezolid with 28 antimicrobial drugs were indifferent, 9 combinations (0.65%) of linezolid with 6 drugs (amoxicillin, erythromycin, imipenem, sparfloxacin, teicoplanin, and tetracycline) were synergistic, and 2 combinations (0.15%) of linezolid with 2 drugs (ofloxacin and sparfloxacin) were antagonistic. overall, the in vitro data demonstrated that linezolid combined with other antimicrobial agents primarily produces an indifferent response, with infrequent occurrences of synergism and antagonism.

TI  == novel pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine-based inhibitors of staphlococcus aureus dna polymerase iii: design, synthesis, and biological evaluation.
AB  == 6-anilinopyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-ones are novel dgtp analogues that inhibit the replication-specific enzyme dna polymerase iii (dna pol iii) of staphlococcus aureus and other gram-positive (gr+) bacteria. to enhance the potential of these  inhibitors as antimicrobial agents, a structure-activity relationship was developed involving substitutions at the 2, 4, and pyrazolo nh positions. all of  the new inhibitors were tested for their ability to inhibit s. aureus dna pol iii and the growth of several other gr+ bacteria in culture. 2-anilino groups with small hydrophobic groups in the meta or para position enhanced both antipolymerase and antimicrobial activity. 2-benzyl-substituted inhibitors were substantially less active. substitution in the 4-position by oxygen gave the optimal activity, whereas substitution at the pyrazolo nh was not tolerated. these pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine derivatives represent a novel class of antimicrobials with promising activities against gr+ bacteria.

TI  == baseline study to determine in vitro activities of daptomycin against gram-positive pathogens isolated in the united states in 2000-2001.
AB  == the activity of daptomycin was assessed by using 6,973 gram-positive bacteria isolated at 50 united states hospitals in 2000 and 2001. among the isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1,163) collected, the rate of penicillin resistance was 16.1%; rates of oxacillin resistance among staphylococcus aureus isolates (n  = 1,018) and vancomycin resistance among enterococcus faecium isolates (n = 368)  were 30.0 and 59.5%, respectively. multidrug-resistant (mdr) phenotypes (isolates resistant to three or more different chemical classes of antimicrobial agents) accounted for 14.2% of s. pneumoniae isolates, 27.1% of s. aureus isolates, and 58.4% of e. faecium isolates. for all gram-positive species tested, mics at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited (mic(90)s) and mic ranges for directed-spectrum agents (daptomycin, quinupristin-dalfopristin, and linezolid) were identical or highly similar for isolates susceptible or resistant to other agents or mdr. daptomycin had a mic(90) of 0.12 micro g/ml for both penicillin-susceptible and -resistant isolates of s. pneumoniae. against oxacillin-resistant s. aureus daptomycin had a mic(90) of 0.5 micro g/ml, and it  had a mic(90) of 4 micro g/ml against both vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant  e. faecium. the mic(90)s for daptomycin and other directed-spectrum agents were unaffected by the regional or anatomical origin of isolates or patient demographic parameters (patient age, gender, and inpatient or outpatient care). our results confirm the gram-positive spectrum of activity of daptomycin and that its activity is independent of susceptibility or resistance to commonly prescribed and tested antimicrobial agents. this study may serve as a baseline to monitor future changes in the susceptibility of gram-positive species to daptomycin following its introduction into clinical use.

TI  == activity of daptomycin against susceptible and multidrug-resistant gram-positive  pathogens collected in the secure study (europe) during 2000-2001.
AB  == antibiotic resistance was prevalent in gram-positive pathogens collected from 40  sites in 15 european countries during 2000-2001. among staphylococcus aureus, 27.3% of all isolates submitted were resistant to oxacillin and ranged from 0% of isolates from the netherlands to 36.9% of isolates from portugal. the overall prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium was 25.1%, with italy submitting the largest percentage of resistant isolates (60.6%). for streptococcus pneumoniae, 9.4% of all isolates collected were resistant to penicillin with variation by country from 0% in the netherlands to 20.7% in portugal. multidrug resistance (mdr), defined as concurrent resistance to three or more antimicrobials of different chemical classes, was observed in 24.6% of s. aureus, 19.6% of e. faecium and 3.6% of s. pneumoniae. the directed spectrum agents daptomycin, linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin were active in vitro against all isolates regardless of their resistance to other agents. daptomycin and quinupristin-dalfopristin (mic(90)s 0.5 mg/l) were equally active against oxacillin-resistant s. aureus compared with linezolid (mic(90) 2 mg/l). the activities of daptomycin, quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid were not affected by resistance to vancomycin in e. faecium (mic(90)s of 4, 2 and 2 mg/l,  respectively). daptomycin was more active against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (mic(90) 0.25 mg/l) than was quinupristin-dalfopristin (mic(90) 0.5 mg/l) or linezolid (mic(90) 2 mg/l). daptomycin was highly active against clinically important gram-positive pathogens, including those that were multiply  resistant to currently available agents. the results of this study provide a benchmark of the activity of daptomycin against contemporary european isolates and will serve as a baseline to monitor future changes in the susceptibility of these organisms to daptomycin.

TI  == emerging bacterial pathogens: a consensus of the scientific data and the risk for development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
AB  == antibiotic resistance in the hospital setting is continuing to increase, particularly in intensive care units (icus) and other areas of the hospital such  as oncology units, where the use of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics is common. the problem of antibiotic resistance is also compounded in the immunocompromised  patient. multi-drug resistance is common among both gram-positive and -negative bacteria, and becoming more prevalent among fungi (yeast). two major antibiotic-resistant pathogens include extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing klebsiella pneumoniae (esbl-kp) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). when  infections occur with esbl-kp, a carbapenem antibiotic is usually the drug of choice. when infection occurs with vre, specific therapy is bacteriostatic, and the clinician may have to rely on empirically selected antibiotics or combinations of antibiotics to achieve a positive outcome. two newly-approved agents, linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin can be used to treat infections caused by resistant gram-positive cocci, but the latter is approved for use against vr-e. faecium. risk factors for the development of esbl-kp include the use of extended-spectrum cephalosporins such as ceftazidime. risk factors for the development of vre include inappropriate use of vancomycin, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and antianaerobic drug therapy such as clindamycin. several institutions have documented a reduction in one or both of these resistant pathogens following a decrease in the use of extended-spectrum cephalosporins combined with the increased use of extended-spectrum penicillins/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, such as piperacillin/tazobactam, for the empiric therapy  of infections. for vre, a reduction in the inappropriate use of vancomycin is also an important interventional strategy along with improved infection control practice.

TI  == partial characterization of bacteriocins produced by environmental strain enterococcus faecium ek13.
AB  == aims: the partial characterization of bacteriocins produced by an environmental strain enterococcus faecium ek13, isolated from cattle dung water. methods and results: a bacteriocin was partially purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by a sp-sepharose column, reverse-phase chromatography and n-terminal region sequenced. the anti-microbial substance produced was found to be a heat-stable polypeptide with molecular mass 4.83 kda, which was determined by n-terminal amino acid sequencing to be enterocin a. a second substance was specified by pcr as enterocin p. bacteriocins were stable at 4 and -20 degrees c  for long storage periods. the optimum of bacteriocin production was observed in the range of ph 5.0-6.5 at 30 and 37 degrees c. the most active substances are produced by strain ek13 in logarithmic growth phase and bacteriocins are produced after 1 h of fermentation. the highest activity detected in fermentation experiments was 51 200 au ml(-1) and the most sensitive indicator strain was found to be listeria innocua lmg 13568. differences in bacteriocin activity against two indicators could be explained by more than one type of enterocin production by strain ek13, or with different mode of action or in different sensitivity of strains. conclusion: enterococcus faecium strain ek13 isolated from cattle dung water produces two bacteriocins, enterocin a and p, with an inhibitory effect against the strain of the genera enterococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus, streptococcus, staphylococcus, bacillus and listeria (in different origin). significance and impact of the study: enterococcus faecium ek13 environmental strain is a new producer of enterocin a and p. the e. faecium ek13, isolated from cattle dung water, is presented with the further aim to utilize it  for waste treatment by biotechnological processes.

TI  == prospective study using standardized methodology for antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-positive cocci isolated from the puerto rico medical center.
AB  == the gram-positive cocci (gpc), staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, have become important causes of community and nosocomial-acquired infections. the prevalence of multiple resistant isolates to standard antimicrobial drugs has significantly increased over the past decades. few prospective studies have been performed in puerto rico (pr) concerning the gpc antimicrobial susceptibilities pattern. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro susceptibility of gpc clinical isolates from pr to selected standard antibiotics and to the new antimicrobial agents, linezolid (lz), quinupristin/dalfopristin (q/d) and gemifloxacin (gm). the in vitro susceptibility utilizing disk diffusion and etest methods to selected antibiotics was determined for a total of 429 isolates obtained during a period of 5 months from the puerto rico medical center bacteriology laboratory. the distribution of gpc collected was as follows: 213 s. aureus isolates, 162 e. faecalis, 16 e. faecium and 38 s. pneumoniae. the results of the susceptibility test demonstrated: 1) that in s. aureus, 100% of the isolates were susceptible to vancomycin (van), lz and q/d; 93% to gm; and 61% to methicillin/oxacillin; 2) in  s. pneumoniae, 100% were susceptible to ln and gm; 87% to q/d; and 53% to penicillin; 3) in e. faecalis, 99% were susceptible to ampicillin; 93% to lz; 79% to gm; 78.6% to van; and 0% to q/d. sixty eight and 66% of the e. faecalis isolates were susceptible to gentamicin and streptomycin respectively; and 4) in  e. faecium, 100% were susceptible to lz; 94% to q/d; 69% to gm; 37.5% to van and  20% to ampicillin. in e. faecium isolates, 50% and 31% were susceptible to gentamicin and streptomycin, respectively. of the vancomycin resistant enterococci, 88.9% and 21% of e. faecium and faecalis showed vana phenotypic resistance, respectively. these results show that there is a significant degree of antimicrobial resistance in gpc, including 38% methicillin resistance in s. aureus, a near 50% penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, and a significant resistance of enterococcal species to van. the new agents, lz, q/d and gm, proved to be effective against both, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae. for e. faecium, both,  lz and q/d were active, while for e. faecalis, only lz showed consistent activity.

TI  == evolution of microbial populations during traditional feta cheese manufacture and ripening.
AB  == in three different dairies (a, b and c) located in peloponess region (southern greece), traditional feta cheese trials took place february to march using mixtures of sheep's and goat's milk. only small variations in the evolution of microbial groups were observed during the whole ripening period. the main groups, such as thermophilic cocci, mesophilic lactococci, thermophilic lactobacilli, nonstarter lactic acid bacteria (nslab), presumptive leuconostoc, enterococci and micrococci, reached their highest levels during the first 16 days, and then declined approximately 1-2 log units until the end of ripening. the remaining groups investigated, comprising yeasts, coliforms and escherichia coli, were highest at day 4. the yeasts remained constant, while coliforms and e. coli decreased sharply and were not detectable after 120 days of ripening. a number of 146 isolates (dairy a) taken from all stages of the manufacturing and ripening process were purified and studied. lactobacillus plantarum (58/146) and isolates  of related species lactobacillus pentosus and lactobacillus paraplantarum (16/146) were the most common microorganisms found during cheese ripening. streptococcus thermophilus (23/146) and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (20/146) were detected in high levels up to 20 days, and then gradually reduced. enterococcus faecium (29/146) was found in all manufacturing and ripening stages.

TI  == mc21-a, a bactericidal antibiotic produced by a new marine bacterium, pseudoalteromonas phenolica sp. nov. o-bc30(t), against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == we previously reported a new marine bacterium, pseudoalteromonas phenolica sp. nov. o-bc30(t), which produced a bactericidal antibiotic against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). in the present study, we purified an anti-mrsa substance (mc21-a) from the methanol extract of the cells of p. phenolica o-bc30(t) and analyzed its chemical structure. mc21-a was determined to be 3,3',5,5'-tetrabromo-2,2'-biphenyldiol by spectrometric analyses. its anti-mrsa activity against 10 clinical isolates of mrsa was comparable to that of vancomycin (mc21-a mics, 1 to 2 micro g/ml; vancomycin mics, <0.25 to 2 micro g/ml). this substance was also high active against enterococcus serolicida, enterococcus faecium, and enterococcus faecalis but was  less active against streptococcus spp. a time-kill study also demonstrated that mc21-a was bactericidal and that its killing rate was much higher than that of vancomycin. the postantibiotic effect (pae) of mc21-a against a clinical mrsa isolate, strain e 31243, was also comparable to that of vancomycin (mc21-a paes,  1.46 to 1.65 h; vancomycin paes, 0.84 to 1.43 h). however, a lysis experiment demonstrated that this substance failed to lyse mrsa cells. this substance also did not lyse human erythrocytes. a sytox green staining experiment implied that this substance permeabilized the cell membrane of mrsa as its mode of action. when its activities against a hypersensitive escherichia coli mutant (ko 1489) and wild-type strains were tested, mc21-a exhibited higher levels of activity against the former. furthermore, mc21-a was not cytotoxic to human normal fibroblast, rat pheochromocytoma, and vero cells at concentrations up to 50 micro g/ml. these results suggest that mc21-a might be useful as a lead compound in the development of new types of anti-mrsa substances with modes of action different from those of vancomycin and teicoplanin.

TI  == multicentre assessment of linezolid antimicrobial activity and spectrum in europe: report from the zyvox antimicrobial potency study (zaps-europe).
AB  == objective: to evaluate the in vitro spectrum and activity of linezolid, a recent  oxazolidinone, according to well-controlled surveillance data from 42 medical centers in 13 countries throughout europe. methods: participants tested the susceptibility of 125 clinical strains of enterococcal and staphylococcal species against 13 drugs using reference broth microdilution trays or the standardized disk diffusion method of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls). streptococcal species (n = 25 at each center) were tested against six drugs using e test (ab biodisk, solna, sweden). quality assurance testing was conducted using nccls-recommended strains and verification of resistance to linezolid and other selected agents was performed by retesting strains at the regional (europe) and international (usa) monitor sites. results: a total of 5598 strains from throughout europe (91% compliance) were tested. vancomycin resistance was reported in only 0.6 and 3.0% of enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium, respectively. penicillin resistance occurred in 25.1% of streptococcus pneumoniae; 4.9% at the high-level (> or =2 mg/l). the mic90 for linezolid was 1  mg/l for streptococci and 2 mg/l for enterococci and staphylococci. using the us  fda- and eucast-recommended susceptible breakpoints for linezolid, there were no  confirmed reports of linezolid resistance [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), > or =8 mg/l]. the distribution of linezolid mic values was unimodal and varied between 0.25 and 1 mg/l for streptococci (>90% of isolates), and between 1 and 2 mg/l for staphylococci (>90%) and enterococci (>95%). there were no differences in linezolid susceptibility in the vancomycin-, oxacillin-, or penicillin-resistant subsets of strains when compared to susceptible organism populations. conclusions: compared to the north american component of this study, there was substantially less vancomycin resistance among e. faecium isolates (europe 3.0% vs. north america 63.4%). while the occurrence of penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae in europe and north america was similar (25.1% vs. 29.7%), the recovery of high-level penicillin-resistant strains was nearly three-fold higher in north america (4.9% vs. 13.2%). only linezolid was universally active against all the tested gram-positive isolates at </=4 mg/l.

TI  == evaluation of a novel automated chemiluminescent assay system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  == the newly developed rapid lumi eiken/is60 (rl/is60) system automatically determines mics by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. the present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility  testing. chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with mics determined by the reference microdilution method. when the mics of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (qc) strains (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the rl/is60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the qc limits  proposed by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the system  was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including e. coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, p. aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae. overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the rl/is60 system and the reference microdilution method. our  results suggest that the rl/is60 system provides rapid and reliable mics of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as qc strains.

TI  == synthesis of novel nocathiacin-class antibiotics. condensation of glycolaldehyde  with primary amides and tandem reductive amination of amadori-rearranged 2-oxoethyl intermediates.
AB  == nocathiacin i (1) and nocathiacin iv (2) are novel indole-containing thiazolyl peptide antibiotics, which exhibit potent activity against key gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including multi drug-resistant staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecium. new nocathiacins 7-12 were prepared from 2 by a condensation with glycolaldehyde followed by tandem reductive amination of the 2-oxoethyl intermediate 4. the latter was formed via amadori rearrangement from initial 2-hydroxyethylideneamide 3. this transformation readily tolerates the complex architecture of nocathiacins and allows selective incorporation of water solubilizing groups to the primary amide  in 2 without protecting group manipulation.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of bal9141, a novel parenteral cephalosporin active against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  == community-acquired and nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-positive pathogens continue to increase in prevalence and have become a serious problem in many parts of the world. bal9141 is a member of the class of parenteral pyrrolidinone-3-ylidenemethyl cephalosporins, and has a broad spectrum of activity. in the current study, bal9141 was tested against a large number (n = 2263) of recent isolates from various international surveillance programmes including 1097 gram-positive strains. susceptibility to (s) and activity of (mg/l) to bal9141, based on proposed breakpoints (mic50/mic90/% s) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (0.5/0.5/100%), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) (1/2/100%), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (0.12/0.25/100%), methicillin-resistant cons (mr-cons) (1/2/100%), streptococcus pneumoniae (< or = 0.015/0.25/100%), viridans group streptococci (0.03/0.5/99%), beta-haemolytic streptococci (< or =  0.015/< or = 0.015/100%), enterococcus faecalis (0.5/16/90%), enterococcus faecium (>32/>32/22%), haemophilus influenzae (0.06/0.06/100%), moraxella catarrhalis (0.06/0.5/100%), neisseria gonorrhoeae (0.03/0.06/100%) and neisseria meningitidis (< or = 0.002/0.004/100%). bal9141 susceptibility at < pr = 4 mg/l (100% s) surpassed that of ceftriaxone (cro; 1% s) and quinupristin/dalfopristin  (q-d; 92% s) against mrsa and mr-cons (cro 0.9% s; q-d 94% s). all s. pneumoniae  were inhibited by bal9141 at < or = 1 mg/l compared with cro (90% s) and levofloxacin (lvx; 98% s). susceptibility rates for viridans group streptococci to bal9141 (>98%) were also higher than to cro (86%) and lvx (96%). bal9141 demonstrated excellent activity against most species of wild-type enteric bacilli, with > or = 95% of isolates being susceptible; however, only modest activity was observed for bal9141 against non-fermentative gram-negative species  and esbl-producing escherichia coli or klebsiella pneumoniae. bal9141 demonstrated excellent activity against many tested pathogens displaying various  resistance phenotypes, and should be particularly valuable in the treatment of mrsa as well as for drug-resistant streptococci, while maintaining a spectrum resembling a 'third-generation' cephalosporin against other clinically important  species.

TI  == different bacteriocin activities of streptococcus mutans reflect distinct phylogenetic lineages.
AB  == bacteriocins produced by mutans streptococci are known as mutacins. in this study 16 broadly active mutacin-producing streptococcus mutans strains from new zealand, north america and europe were classified into four groups (a-d) on the basis of differences in their activity in deferred antagonism tests against either the homologous producer strain (to test for presence of self-immunity) or  indicator strains staphylococcus aureus 46 and enterococcus faecium te1. two of the strains included in the study (ua140 and ua96) were representatives of the group i and ii mutacin producer strains previously described by caufield and co-workers. one of the new zealand isolates of group a (s. mutans strain n) appeared to produce inhibitory activity similar to that of the group i prototype  strain ua140. four other new zealand isolates of group b (s. mutans strains m19,  m34, b34 and d14) had mutacin ii-like activity. the group b mutacin producers differed from the group a mutacin producers in their additional activity against  staph. aureus 46. seven s. mutans strains (m46, b46, b57, m12, m28, b28 and 13m)  were distinguished from the group a and group b mutacin producers in that they inhibited e. faecium te1. these were called group c mutacin producers. strains h7 and h23 resembled the group c strains in their action on both indicator strains te1 and 46. however, these two strains failed to exhibit immunity to their own inhibitory products in the deferred antagonism test and were separately classified as group d mutacin producers. phylogenetic analysis of the strains by  several genotypic and phenotypic characteristics revealed that the mutacin groups were associated with distinct evolutionary lineages of s. mutans.

TI  == [surveillance for antimicrobial resistance: vira study].
AB  == introduction: resistance to antimicrobial drugs has increased in recent years. the aim of this multicenter study was to determine the current situation in spain regarding the resistance patterns of the most common infectious agents to antimicrobial drugs. material and methods: a total 1,475 strains isolated in 38 hospitals in october 2001 were studied. these included 294 methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), 149 clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), 96 enterococcus faecium, 1 ampicillin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, 204 penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, 100 ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae, 361 ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli, 160 pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 110 acinetobacter baumannii. sensitivity to various antibiotics was studied by a broth microdilution method. additionally, an epidemiologic survey was conducted in the participating hospitals to determine the incidence of these multi-drug resistant microorganisms. results: overall incidence of ciprofloxacin-resistant e. coli and mrsa strains was 24% in both cases. the pneumococci were resistant to several antibiotics. telithromycin showed excellent activity against all the pneumococci, including those resistant to macrolides. most mrsa isolates were resistant to quinolones and macrolides. all the staphylococci were susceptible to linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin. only 50% of a. baumannii strains were susceptible  to imipenem. conclusion: the results of this study evidence increasing multi-drug resistance among various microorganisms, such as mrsa, cns, ampicillin-resistant  enterococci, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci, and underline the need for surveillance programs to gain information on this significant therapeutic problem.

TI  == inhibition by yeast killer toxin-like antibodies of oral streptococci adhesion to tooth surfaces in an ex vivo model.
AB  == background: monoclonal (ktmab) and recombinant (ktscfv) anti-idiotypic antibodies, representing the internal image of a yeast killer toxin, proved to be microbicidal in vitro against important eukaryotic and prokaryotic pathogens such as candida albicans, pneumocystis carinii, mycobacterium tuberculosis, staphylococcus aureus, s. haemolyticus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae, including multidrug-resistant strains. ktmab and ktscfv exerted a strong therapeutic effect in well-established animal models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis. streptococcus mutans is the most important etiologic agent of dental caries that might result from the metabolic end products of dental plaque. effective strategies to reduce the disease potential of dental plaque have considered the possibility of using antibiotics or antibodies against oral streptococci in general and s. mutans in particular. in this study, the activity of ktmab and ktscfv against s. mutans and the inhibition and reduction by ktmab of dental colonization by s. mutans and other oral streptococci in an ex vivo model of human teeth were investigated. materials and  methods: ktscfv and ktmab were used in a conventional colony forming unit (cfu) assay against a serotype c strain of s. mutans, and other oral streptococci (s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. salivarius). an ex vivo model of human teeth submerged in saliva was used to establish ktmab potential of inhibiting or reducing the adhesion to dental surfaces by s. mutans and other oral streptococci. results: ktmab and ktscfv kill in vitro s. mutans and other oral streptococci. ktmab inhibit colonization of dental surfaces by s. mutans and oral streptococci in the ex vivo model. conclusions: killer antibodies with antibiotic activity or their engineered derivatives may have a potential in the prevention of dental caries in vivo.

TI  == synthesis and utilisation of folate by yoghurt starter cultures and probiotic bacteria.
AB  == thirty-two bacterial isolates from species commonly used in yoghurts and fermented milks were examined for their ability to synthesise or utilise folate during fermentation of skim milk. the organisms examined included the traditional yoghurt starter cultures, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus, and probiotic lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and enterococcus faecium. folate was synthesised by s. thermophilus, bifidobacteria,  and e. faecium. s. thermophilus was the dominant producer, elevating folate levels in skim milk from 11.5 ng g(-1) to between 40 and 50 ng g(-1). generally,  lactobacilli depleted the available folate in the skim milk. fermentations with mixed cultures showed that folate production and utilisation by the cultures was  additive. fermentations using a combination of bifidobacterium animalis and s. thermophilus resulted in a six-fold increase in folate concentration. although increased folate levels in yoghurts and fermented milks are possible through judicious selection of inoculum species, the folate levels remain relatively low  in terms of recommended daily allowance.

TI  == isolation and partial characterization of an antibacterial substance produced by  enterococcus faecium.
AB  == a strain of enterococcus faecium isolated from bulgarian yellow cheese "kashkaval" produced a bacteriocin-like substance named enterococcin a 2000. the  antibacterial substance had a low molar mass (< 2 kda), was relatively stable toward heat but was sensitive to selected proteolytic enzymes. it was active against gram-positive bacteria including enterococci, such as listeria, bacillus  and streptococcus, and also against gram-negative e. coli. production of enterococcin a 2000 has a maximum near the end of the exponential phase of producer growth. the peptide was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, butanol extraction, followed by cation-exchange chromatography and reversed-phase chromatography. a partial sequence of purified enterococcin a 2000 indicated that this substance does not belong to the class iia of bacteriocins presenting the consensus anti-listeria motif ygngv.

TI  == [interpretative reading of the antibiogram in gram-positive cocci].
AB  == resistance to methicillin in staphylococcus is related to expression of the gene  meca, and implies resistance to all beta-lactams. breakpoints for interpretation  of this mechanism differ in s. aureus and in coagulase-negative species. in relation to macrolides-lincosamides-streptograminsb, the most frequent mechanism  among resistant strains is expression of methylases (erm genes). topoisomerase changes caused by point mutations and expression of the efflux pump nora determine resistance to quinolones, but there are great differences on the activity of different compounds, which makes interpretative reading difficult. strains of s. aureus with intermediate susceptibility to glycopeptides (gisa strains) have been recently described. in spain, there is a high percentage of s. pneumoniae strains intermediate or resistant to penicillin, and a low percentage  of strains intermediate or resistant to third generation cephalosporins, because  of mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. the most frequent phenotype of resistance to macrolides in this species is caused by methylase production. resistance to quinolones is still uncommon, and is related to the mechanisms previously indicated for staphylococcus, but clinical interpretation of the antibiograma for this organism is even more complex. no strains of s. pyogenes resistant to penicillin have yet been described. in spain the most common phenotype of resistance to macrolides in s. pyogenes is determined by efflux pumps (mef genes), affecting 14- and 15-membered macrolides. e. faecalis is usually susceptible to ampicillin, in contrast to e. faecium. enterococci show intrinsic resistance to aminoglycosides, but still remain susceptible to the combination of these antimicrobials and cell-wall active agents. strains expressing different aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes became resistant to the combination. glycopeptide-resistant strains of enterococci are uncommon in our country, but several genotypes, of which vana is the most relevant from a clinical point of view, have been described in other regions.

TI  == the antibacterial activity of topical retinoids: the case of retinaldehyde.
AB  == background: retinoids such as retinoic acid (ra), retinol (rol) and retinaldehyde (ral) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. aim: to analyse the potential anti-infective  activities of topical rol, ral and ra. methods: microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of rol, ral and ra were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus flavus, propionibacterium acnes, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus hominis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant s. aureus, methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, streptococcus group b, enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and pseudomonas/klebsiella. in two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% ral or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% ral or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. results: of the three retinoids tested, only ral showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like s. aeureus, micrococcus spp. or  p. acnes. no activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. these results on  reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. mic(50) and mic(90) values for ral were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant s. aureus. the two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with ral had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. in the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2)  for p. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. no resistant bacteria were  found after 2 weeks of topical use. preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of ral is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. conclusion: we have shown that ral differs from parent natural retinoids such as rol and ra in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. this activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the  potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.

AB  == although there is considerable interest in identifying mercury-resistant bacteria, no standardized assay exists for this purpose. in this study, the effect of the composition of the medium on the susceptibility of oral streptococci to hgcl(2) was investigated. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of hgcl(2) for 52 streptococcal strains and the reproducibility of mic values for hg-sensitive and hg-resistant strains was determined with 11 different media. addition of blood increased the mic values, and some media (tryptone soya  agar, with or without blood) could not discriminate between hg-sensitive and hg-resistant strains. the proportion of streptococci that appeared to be resistant to hg was very high (>70%) on some media (mitis-salivarius, tryptone soya, columbia), but not on others (mueller-hinton, brain heart infusion, isosensitest). the mics of the control strains varied considerably on different testing occasions for tryptone soya agar (with and without blood), isosensitest agar, and columbia agar (with blood). mueller-hinton (without blood) appeared to  be the most suitable medium for isolating hg-resistant oral streptococci.

AB  == a study was conducted to determine whether bacterial direct-fed microbials (dfm)  could be used to minimize the risk of acidosis in feedlot cattle receiving high concentrate diets. six ruminally cannulated steers, previously adapted to a high  concentrate diet, were used in a double 3 x 3 latin square to study the effects of dfm on feed intake, ruminal ph, and ruminal and blood characteristics. steers  were provided ad libitum access to a diet containing steam-rolled barley, barley  silage, and a protein-mineral supplement at 87, 9, and 4% (dm basis), respectively. treatments were as follows: control, propionibacterium p15 (p15), and propionibacterium p15 and enterococcus faecium ef212 (pe). the bacterial treatments (10(9) cfu/g) plus whey powder carrier, or whey powder alone for control, were top-dressed once daily at the time of feeding (10 g/[steer/d]). periods consisted of 2 wk of adaptation and 1 wk of measurements. ruminal ph was  continuously measured for 6 d using indwelling electrodes. dry matter intake and  ruminal ph (mean, minimum, hours, and area ph < 5.8 or < 5.5) were not affected by treatment (p > 0.05). however, supplementation with p15 increased protozoal numbers (p < 0.05) with a concomitant increase in ruminal nh3 concentration (p <  0.01) and a decrease in the number of amylolytic bacteria (p < 0.05) compared with the control. streptococcus bovis, enumerated using a selective medium, was numerically reduced with supplementation of pe. although blood ph and blood glucose were not affected by dfm supplementation, steers fed pe had numerically lower concentrations of blood co2 than control steers, which is consistent with a reduced risk of metabolic acidosis. although the bacterial dfm used in this study did not induce changes in dmi or ruminal and blood ph, some rumen and blood variables indicated that the bacterial dfm used in this study may decrease the risk of acidosis in feedlot cattle.

TI  == multicenter assessment of the linezolid spectrum and activity using the disk diffusion and etest methods: report of the zyvox(r) antimicrobial potency study in latin america (la-zaps).
AB  == linezolid was the first clinically applied member of the new antimicrobial class  called the oxazolidinones. these agents have a powerful spectrum of activity focussed against gram-positive organisms including strains with documented resistances to other antimicrobial classes. we conducted a multicenter surveillance (zyvox antimicrobial potency study; zaps) trial of qualifying gram-positive isolates from 24 medical centers in eight countries in latin america. the activity and spectrum of linezolid was compared to numerous agents including glycopeptides, quinupristin/dalfopristin, beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones when testing 2,640 strains by the standardized disk diffusion method or etest (ab biodisk, solna, sweden). the linezolid spectrum was complete  against staphylococci (median zone diameter, 29 - 32 mm), as was the spectrum of  vancomycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin. among the enterococci, no linezolid resistance was detected, and the susceptibility rate was 93.1 - 96.4%. only the vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium strains remained susceptible (92.8%)  to quinupristin/dalfopristin. marked differences in the glycopeptide resistance patterns (van a versus van b) were noted for the 22 isolates of vre, thus requiring local susceptibility testing to direct therapy. streptococcus pneumoniae and other species were very susceptible (100.0%) to linezolid, mic(90) at 0.75 microg/ml. penicillin non-susceptible rate was 27.7% and erythromycin resistance was at 17.4%. other streptococci were also completely susceptible to linezolid (mic(90), 1 microg/ml). these results provide the initial benchmark of  potency and spectrum for linezolid in latin american medical centers. future comparisons should recognize that the oxazolidinones possess essentially a complete spectrum coverage of the monitored staphylococci, enterococci and streptococcal isolates in 2000-2001. this positions linezolid as the widest spectrum empiric choice against multi-resistant gram-positive cocci, a spectrum of activity greater than available glycopeptides and the streptogramin combination.

TI  == source of enterococci in a farmhouse raw-milk cheese.
AB  == enterococci are widely distributed in raw-milk cheeses and are generally thought  to positively affect flavor development. their natural habitats are the human and animal intestinal tracts, but they are also found in soil, on plants, and in the  intestines of insects and birds. the source of enterococci in raw-milk cheese is  unknown. in the present study, an epidemiological approach with pulsed-field gel  electrophoresis (pfge) was used to type 646 enterococcus strains which were isolated from a cheddar-type cheese, the milk it was made from, the feces of cows and humans associated with the cheese-making unit, and the environment, including the milking equipment, the water used on the farm, and the cows' teats. nine different pfge patterns, three of enterococcus casseliflavus, five of enterococcus faecalis, and one of enterococcus durans, were found. the same three clones, one of e. faecalis and two of e. casseliflavus, dominated almost all of the milk, cheese, and human fecal samples. the two e. casseliflavus clones were also found in the bulk tank and the milking machine even after chlorination, suggesting that a niche where enterococci could grow was present and that contamination with enterococci begins with the milking equipment. it is likely but unproven that the enterococci present in the human feces are due to consumption of the cheese. cow feces were not considered the source of enterococci in the cheese, as enterococcus faecium and streptococcus bovis, which largely dominated the cows' intestinal tracts, were not found in either the milk  or the cheese.

TI  == a multicenter evaluation of linezolid antimicrobial activity in north america.
AB  == overall, 141 centers in north america enrolled in this international surveillance study designed to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity and spectrum of linezolid, a new oxazolidinone. each participant tested the susceptibility of clinical isolates of staphylococcal species (n = 85) against 12 drugs, and enterococcal species (n = 40) against 6 drugs using reference broth microdilution trays; and of streptococcal species (n = 25) against 6 drugs using etests (ab biodisk, solna, sweden). quality control testing was conducted using recommended  strains, and verification of resistance to linezolid and select other agents was  performed by a regional monitor. of the 20,161 isolates collected from sites across the united states (us; n = 132) and canada (n = 9), 18,307 were included in this analysis. oxacillin resistance occurred in 38.7 and 70.6% of staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcal (cons) isolates, respectively. vancomycin resistance was reported in 65.9 and 2.6% of enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis, respectively. penicillin resistance occurred in 37.2% of streptococcus pneumoniae, 17.5% constituting high-level resistance (mic, > or =2  microg/ml). the mic(90) for linezolid was 1 microg/ml for streptococci, 2 microg/ml for enterococci and cons isolates, and 4 microg/ml for s. aureus. using the us fda-recommended susceptible breakpoints for linezolid, there were no confirmed reports of linezolid resistance (i.e., mic > or =8 microg/ml). the occurrence of linezolid mics was unimodal and generally varied between, 1-4 microg/ml for staphylococci (94% of recorded results), 1-2 microg/ml for enterococci (93%), and 0.5-1 microg/ml for streptococci (85%). susceptibility to  linezolid was not influenced by susceptibility to other antiicrobials such as vancomycin, beta-lactams or macrolides. only linezolid was universally active against essentially all tested gram-positive specimens. the unimodal susceptibility pattern is indicative of excellent and near complete activity against key gram-positive pathogens including multiply resistant strains, but surveillance for emerging resistances (rare) and the performance of routine susceptibility tests to guide patient therapy seems prudent.

TI  == evaluation of the vitek 2 system for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of medically relevant gram-positive cocci.
AB  == a study was conducted to evaluate the new vitek 2 system (biomerieux) for identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of gram-positive cocci. clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (n = 100), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (n = 100), enterococcus spp. (n = 89), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 29), and streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 66) were examined with the id-gpc identification card and with the ast-p515 (for staphylococci), ast-p516 (for enterococci and s. agalactiae) and ast-p506 (for pneumococci) susceptibility cards. the identification comparison methods were the api staph for staphylococci and the api 20 strep for streptococci and enterococci; for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the agar dilution method according to the procedure of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) was used. the vitek 2 system correctly identified to the species level (only one choice or after simple supplementary tests) 99% of s. aureus, 96.5% of s. agalactiae, 96.9% of s. pneumoniae, 92.7% of enterococcus faecalis, 91.3% of staphylococcus haemolyticus, and 88% of staphylococcus epidermidis but was least able to identify enterococcus faecium (71.4% correct). more than 90% of gram-positive cocci were identified within 3 h. according to the nccls breakpoints, antimicrobial susceptibility testing with the vitek 2 system gave 96% correct category agreement, 0.82% very major errors, 0.17% major errors, and 2.7% minor errors. antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed category agreement from 94 to 100% for s. aureus, from 90 to 100% for cns, from 91 to 100% for enterococci, from 96 to 100% for s. agalactiae, and from 91 to 100% for s. pneumoniae. microorganism-antibiotic combinations that gave very major errors were cns-erythromycin, cns-oxacillin, enterococci-teicoplanin, and enterococci-high-concentration gentamicin. major errors were observed for cns-oxacillin and s. agalactiae-tetracycline combinations. in conclusion the results of this study indicate that the vitek 2 system represents an accurate and acceptable means for performing identification and antibiotic susceptibility tests with medically relevant gram-positive cocci.

TI  == [therapeutic impact of streptococcal and enterococcal bacteremia in hematology patients].
AB  == from january 1999 to may 2000 (17 months), 21 strains of streptococci and four strains of enterococci have been isolated from 74 blood cultures in 25 infectious episodes in hematologic patients. they concerned 21 patients, of 21 to 77 years old. these patients suffered from acute leukaemia (14 cases), chronic lymphoid leukaemia (two cases), non-hodgkin's lymphoma (two cases) or myeloma (three cases). seventeen patients displayed a single streptococcal or enterococcal episode, two had two episodes in the course of a single stay in the hospital, two others in the course of two different stays. during 16 episodes (64%), the bacteremia occurred within 15 days after the onset of neutropenia consecutive to  antimitotic chemotherapy, and in nine episodes (36%) it has occurred after a period exceeding 15 days. in six cases the patients had already received antibiotics with a large antibacterial activity (beta-lactam, fluoroquinolone and/or glycopeptide +/- aminoside) and in four cases a single antibiotic (synergistine or cotrimoxazole). most streptococci (20/21) were oral streptococci (ten streptococcus mitis, five s. oralis, two s. sanguis, three s. pneumoniae). a single strain of beta-hemolytic streptococci has been identified as s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. the enterococci were one strain of enterococcus  faecalis and three e. faecium. ten streptococci were susceptible to 0.25 mg/l of  penicillin g, ten were less susceptible (0.5 < or = mic < 32 mg/l), and a strain  was resistant (mic = 32 mg/l). eighteen strains were susceptible to amoxicillin and cefotaxime. for three strains, the mics of amoxicillin and cefotaxime (8-16 mg/l and 8-32 mg/l, respectively) were higher. levels of resistance of the enterococci to the beta-lactam (penicillin, amoxicillin, and piperacillin) were variable. all species were susceptible to glycopeptides. three patients were transferred in intensive care unit for respiratory distress or shock syndrome. their evolution has remained severe under antibiotherapy comprising beta-lactam or vancomycin associated with an aminoside. this results demonstrate the interest of species identification to adapt the antibiotic treatment and confirms the frequency of oral streptococci in severe bacteremia in neutropenic patients.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--i. gram-positive bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial sensitivity for czop were  also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen  species (1,913 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa; n = 178), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa; n = 199), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse; n = 98), methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis (mrse; n = 164), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 72), staphylococcus saprophyticus (n = 28), enterococcus faecalis (n = 206), enterococcus faecium (n  = 91), enterococcus avium (n = 72), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 133), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 138), penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp; n = 133), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp; n = 100), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp; n = 29), streptococcus milleri group (n = 135) and peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 137). czop possessed comparable antibacterial activities against mssa and msse to other cephems, and was also effective on mrse but not on mrsa. an antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than other cephems. czop, however, did not indicate an antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus, just like other cephems. an antibacterial activity of czop against e. faecalis was comparable to cefpirome (cpr) and higher than other cephems. no antibacterial activity of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, just like other drugs. an antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as that of cefotiam (ctm), cefepime (cfpm) and cpr, and that against s. agalactiae was also preferable. czop and other cephems also had a preferable antibacterial activity against s. milleri group that was most sensitive to benzylpenicillin. an antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than that of cefazolin, ctm and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated with breakpoint mic of czop was 96.5% in mrsa, 93.1% in prsp, 60.0% in  pisp, 40.3% in s. haemolyticus, 22.3% in e. faecalis, and 15.9% in mrse. those resistance ratios were similar to those for cfpm, but e. faecalis showed 90.8% resistance for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against this species. in conclusion, no remarkable annual change in the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria was observed. the sensitivities of pisp and prsp to czop, however, was suggested to be decreasing.

TI  == antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance: a population perspective.
AB  == the need to stem the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance has prompted multiple, sometimes conflicting, calls for changes in the use of antimicrobial agents. one source of disagreement concerns the major mechanisms by which antibiotics select resistant strains. for infections like tuberculosis, in which  resistance can emerge in treated hosts through mutation, prevention of antimicrobial resistance in individual hosts is a primary method of preventing the spread of resistant organisms in the community. by contrast, for many other important resistant pathogens, such as penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium resistance is mediated by the acquisition of genes or gene fragments by horizontal transfer; resistance in the treated host is a relatively  rare event. for these organisms, indirect, population-level mechanisms of selection account for the increase in the prevalence of resistance. these mechanisms can operate even when treatment has a modest, or even negative, effect on an individual host's colonization with resistant organisms.

TI  == pharmacodynamic properties of hmr 3004, a novel ketolide, on respiratory pathogens, enterococci and bacteroides fragilis demonstrated by studies of time kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect.
AB  == objective: the pharmacodynamic properties of the novel ketolide (a new class of macrolide) antibiotic, hmr 3004, were investigated by studying time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect. methods: the time-kill kinetics were studied at two inocula against three strains each of staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and bacteroides fragilis. the postantibiotic effects of hmr 3004 were also investigated on these organisms  at concentrations equivalent to 1, 4 and 10 x mic. results: the time kill-kinetic data demonstrated that hmr 3004 is inoculum dependent and predominantly bacteriostatic being only slowly bactericidal at higher concentrations. hmr 3004  exhibited a significant postantibiotic effect with all strains studied, ranging from 1.9--6.2 h at 10 x mic. conclusions: the bacteriostatic activity and significant postantibiotic effect demonstrated by hmr 3004 are similar to those previously obtained with other macrolides.

TI  == in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against selected bacterial pathogens isolated in italy.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin, against 732 clinical strains recently isolated in italy. methods: susceptibility tests were performed according to nccls-guided mic methodology. pathogens included in the evaluation included 108 staphylococcus aureus isolates, 124 coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates, 158 streptococcus pyogenes isolates, 30 streptococcus agalactiae isolates, 30 b-hemolytic streptococcal isolates, 18 streptococcus sanguis isolates, 80 streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 69 enterococcal isolates, 40 haemophilus influenzae isolates, 30 moraxella catarrhalis isolates and, finally, 30 gram-positive and 25 gram-negative anaerobes. results: quinupristin/dalfopristin  inhibited staphylococcus aureus and other staphylococcus spp., irrespective of their oxacillin or erythromycin resistance phenotypes. similarly, streptococci were fully inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin. enterococcus faecalis was not  included in the spectrum of this streptogramin, while isolates of enterococcus faecium were inhibited by the new compound. respiratory pathogens such as h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis were inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin as well as all gram-negative anaerobes tested. conclusions: these findings suggest a putative role for quinupristin/dalfopristin in the empirical treatment of severe  nosocomial and community-acquired infections caused by pathogens often displaying resistance to multiple antibiotics. this drug may provide an alternative to glycopeptide compounds.

TI  == extracellular arginine aminopeptidase from streptococcus gordonii fss2.
AB  == streptococcus gordonii is a primary etiological agent in the development of subacute bacterial endocarditis (sbe), producing thrombus formation and tissue damage on the surfaces of heart valves. this is ironic, considering its normal role as a benign inhabitant of the oral microflora. however, strain fss2 of s. gordonii has been found to produce several extracellular aminopeptidase- and fibrinogen-degrading activities during growth in a ph-controlled batch culture. in this report, we describe the purification, characterization, and partial cloning of a predicted serine class arginine aminopeptidase (rap) with some cysteine class characteristics. isolation of this enzyme by anion-exchange, gel filtration, and isoelectric focusing chromatography yielded a protein monomer of  approximately 70 kda, as shown by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization, gel filtration, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. nested-pcr cloning enabled the isolation of a 324-bp-long dna fragment encoding the 108-amino-acid n terminus of rap. culture activity profiles and n-terminal sequence analysis indicated the export of this protein from the cell surface. homology was found with a putative dipeptidase from streptococcus pyogenes and nonspecific dipeptidases from lactobacillus helveticus and lactococcus lactis. we believe that rap may serve as a critical factor for arginine acquisition during nutrient stress in vivo and also in the proteolysis of host proteins and peptides during sbe pathology.

TI  == antimicrobial efficacy of chloroxylenol and chlorhexidine in the treatment of infected root canals.
AB  == purpose: to investigate the antimicrobial efficacy of a chlorhexidine gluconate (2.0%) and of an ethanolic chloroxylenol solution (10%) as a temporary root canal dressing against selected test microorganisms (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecium, escherichia coli, candida albicans). materials and methods: extracted single-rooted human teeth were instrumented up to size 40. after removal of the smear layer suspensions of the test microorganisms were inserted into the root canals. after incubation for 48 hrs each suspension of the test organisms was removed and the root canals were filled with one of the two different disinfectants. the teeth were then incubated for 48 hrs. twelve teeth and three controls were used for each of the four test organisms and each of the  two regimens. after incubation, each root canal was instrumented and the removed  canal wall dentin was examined microbiologically. results: with a contact time of 48 hrs between the two disinfectants and the four bacterial suspensions the medications led to a total killing of microorganisms in 82% of a total of 96 contaminated teeth. in the dentin layer situated 50 microm from the root canal, both medications achieved bacterial killing in a range from 99.9% to 99.99%, depending on the test organism. there were no significant differences (p> 0.1) between the relative antimicrobial activity of the two root canal dressings.

TI  == the duel study: a multi-center in vitro evaluation of linezolid compared with other antibiotics in the netherlands.
AB  == objective: to evaluate bacterial susceptibility to linezolid in the netherlands in comparison with other antibiotics. methods: bacterial strains were isolated between september 1999 and january 2000 from patients presumed to require antibiotic treatment. the in vitro activity of 1226 strains from 34 participating laboratories was tested against linezolid, vancomycin, teicoplanin, oxacillin, penicillin, erythromycin, ampicillin and other antibiotics against enterococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) were obtained with the e test on mueller-hinton agar: every laboratory included control strains. for vancomycin and teicoplanin only, brain-heart infusion agar and an inoculum of 2.0 mcfarland  was used for staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci to support a better growth and clear recognition of hetero-resistant  colonies. results: the values of mic90 for linezolid were 1.5, 0.75, 0.75 and 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococci, respectively. six enterococcal strains with decreased susceptibility against vancomycin or teicoplanin were identified as enterococcus  faecium, e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus (two strains each) and they were found to harbor vana, vanc1 and vanc2/3 genes, respectively. nine per cent of streptococcus pneumoniae (an increase from 1% 4 years ago) showed decreased susceptibility to erythromycin, of both the ermb and mefe type; there was no cross-resistance with linezolid. twelve coagulase-negative staphylococcal strains were resistant to teicoplanin. conclusion: linezolid is a promising drug in the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive cocci. cross-resistance with other antibiotics tested was not found.

TI  == in vitro activity of linezolid against gram-positive uropathogens of hospitalized patients with complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of linezolid, a recently developed antibiotic agent active against gram-positive bacteria, was tested against pathogens from three different collections. (1) uropathogens from hospitalized urological patients (1990/1991) with complicated and/or hospital-acquired utis; urologic clinic, hospital st. elisabeth, straubing. (2) uropathogens from a multi-centre study (1995/1996) comprising 37 urological centres throughout germany. (3) mrsa isolates of patients and staff (1999/2000) within the hospital st. elisabeth, straubing. genotyping of the latter isolates was performed by pulsed-field-electrophoresis. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of linezolid determined by an agar (isosensitest) dilution method using a multipoint inoculator and an inoculum of 10(4) cfu per point ranged for methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (n=27) between 2 and 4 mg/l, for methicillin resistant s. aureus (mrsa) (n=35) between 1 and 2 mg/l, for methicillin susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (msse) (n=67) between 0.5 and 4 mg/l, for methicillin resistant cns (mrse) (n=19) between 0.25  and 2 mg/l, for enterococcus. faecalis (n=184) between 0.5 and 4 mg/l, for e. faecium (n=3) 2 mg/l and for streptococcus spp. (n=4) between 0.25 and 1 mg/l, indicating that all strains were susceptible. according to the in vitro activity, linezolid may be considered a promising antibacterial agent for the treatment of  complicated uti caused by gram-positive uropathogens. thus, linezolid should be evaluated in a clinical study.

AB  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin was studied in comparison with other agents active against 328 recent clinical isolates of gram-positive pathogens. mic data  showed that the addition of calcium ions to a final concentration of 50 mg/l enhanced the activity of daptomycin generally by eight- to 16-fold. in the presence of calcium ions daptomycin was uniformly active against the strains of staphylococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. studied with a mic90 of < or = 1 mg/l. enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium were slightly less susceptible (mic90 2 mg/l). vancomycin-, fluoroquinolone- and quinupristin/dalfopristin-resistant strains were all susceptible to daptomycin. the presence of serum reduced the apparent activity of daptomycin to only a moderate extent. employing the bsac methodologies, a tentative breakpoint of 2 mg/l for daptomycin is proposed.

TI  == synthesis and biological evaluation of vancomycin dimers with potent activity against vancomycin-resistant bacteria: target-accelerated combinatorial synthesis.
AB  == based on the notion that dimerization and/or variation of amino acid 1 of vancomycin could potentially enhance biological activity, a series of synthetic and chemical biology studies were undertaken in order to discover potent antibacterial agents. herein we describe two ligation methods (disulfide formation and olefin metathesis) for dimerizing vancomycin derivatives and applications of target-accelerated combinatorial synthesis (e.g. combinatorial synthesis in the presence of vancomycin's target ac2-l-lys-d-ala-d-ala) to generate libraries of vancomycin dimers. screening of these compound libraries led to the identification of a number of highly potent antibiotics effective against vancomycin-suspectible, vancomycin-intermediate resistant and, most significantly, vancomycin-resistant bacteria.

TI  == solid- and solution-phase synthesis of vancomycin and vancomycin analogues with activity against vancomycin-resistant bacteria.
AB  == vancomycin, the prototypical member of the glycopeptide family of antibiotics, is a clinically used antibiotic employed against a variety of drug-resistant bacterial strains including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). the recent emergence of vancomycin resistance, viewed as a growing threat to public health, prompted us to initiate a program aimed at restoring the potency of this important antibiotic through chemical manipulation of the vancomycin structure. herein, we describe the development of synthetic technology based on the design of a novel selenium safety catch linker, application of this technology to a solid-phase semisynthesis of vancomycin, and the solid- and solution-phase synthesis of vancomycin libraries. biological evaluation of these  compound libraries led to the identification of a number of in vitro highly potent antibacterial agents effective against vancomycin-resistant bacteria. in addition to aiding these investigations, the solid-phase chemistry described herein is expected to enhance the power of combinatorial chemistry and facilitate chemical biology and medicinal chemistry studies.

TI  == a simple model host for identifying gram-positive virulence factors.
AB  == we demonstrate the use of the nematode caenorhabditis elegans as a facile and inexpensive model host for several gram-positive human bacterial pathogens. enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus, but not bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecium, or streptococcus pyogenes, kill adult c. elegans. focusing our studies on the enterococcal species, we found that both e. faecalis and e. faecium kill c. elegans eggs and hatchlings, although only e. faecalis kills the adults. in the case of adults, a low inoculum of e. faecalis grows to a high titer in the c. elegans intestine, resulting in a persistent infection that cannot be eradicated by prolonged feeding on e. faecium. interestingly, a high titer of e. faecium also accumulates in the nematode gut, but does not affect the longevity of the worms. two e. faecalis virulence-related factors that play an important role in mammalian models of infection, fsr, a putative quorum-sensing system, and cytolysin, are also important for nematode killing. we exploit the apparent parallels between gram-positive infection in simple and more complex organisms by using the nematode to identify an e. faecalis virulence factor, scrb, which is relevant to  mammalian pathogenesis.

TI  == resistance studies with daptomycin.
AB  == we studied the in vitro emergence of resistance to daptomycin using three methods: spontaneous resistance incidence, serial passage in the presence of increasing drug concentrations, and chemical mutagenesis. no spontaneously resistant mutants were obtained for any organism tested (<10(-10) for staphylococcus aureus, <10(-9) for staphylococcus epidermidis, <10(-9) for enterococcus faecalis, <10(-9) for enterococcus faecium, <10(-8) for streptococcus pneumoniae). population analysis demonstrated that bacterial susceptibility to daptomycin is heterogeneous. assay results were sensitive to calcium concentration and culture density, both of which can affect apparent resistance rates. stable s. aureus mutants were isolated by both serial passage in liquid media and chemical mutagenesis. the daptomycin mics for these isolates  were 8- to 32-fold higher than for the parental strain. many mutants with high mics (>12.5 microg/ml) had significant growth defects but did not display phenotypes typical of s. aureus small colony variants. the voltage component (delta psi) of the bacterial membrane potential was increased in three independent resistant isolates. in vivo data showed that some daptomycin-resistant mutants had lost significant virulence. for other mutants, the degree of in vitro resistance was greater than the change in in vivo susceptibility. these results suggest that infection with some daptomycin-resistant organisms may still be easily treatable.

AB  == objective: to provide a comprehensive review of linezolid, the first of a new class of antibiotics, the oxazolidinones. therapeutic issues regarding the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria and a brief history of the oxazolidinones are also discussed. data sources: a medline search (1966-march 2001) was conducted to identify pertinent literature, including preclinical trials, clinical trials, and reviews. unpublished clinical data, adverse effects, and dosing information were abstracted from product labeling. study selection: clinical efficacy data were extracted from clinical trials, case reports, and abstracts that mentioned linezolid. additional information concerning antibiotic  resistance, the oxazolidinones, in vitro susceptibility and the pharmacokinetic profile of linezolid also was reviewed. data synthesis: linezolid exhibits activity against many gram-positive organisms, including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. linezolid inhibits bacterial protein synthesis at an early step in translation and is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract following oral administration. efficacy  has been demonstrated in a number of unpublished clinical trials in adults with pneumonia, skin and skin structure infections, and vancomycin-resistant e. faecium infections. the adverse effect profile is similar to that of comparator agents (beta-lactams, clarithrornycin, vancomycin). conclusions: linezolid is the first oral antimicrobial agent approved for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococci. since the oxazoildinones have a unique mechanism of action and expanded spectrum of activity against virulent and highly resistant gram positive pathogens, linezolid is a valuable alternative to currently available treatment options. clinical trials evaluating linezolid and other oxazolidinones for antibiotic-resistant gram-positive infections, as well as comparator studies comparing linezolid with other candidate drugs, such as quinupristin/dalfopristin and choramphenicol, will further define the role of linezolid.

TI  == linezolid: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  == linezolid is the first of a new class of antibacterial drugs, the oxazolidinones. it has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), glycopeptide-intermediate s. aureus (gisa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the drug also shows activity against certain anaerobes, including clostridium perfringens, c. difficile, peptostreptococcus spp. and bacteroidesfragilis. in controlled phase iii studies, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in the treatment of patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci and also demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by vre. further phase iii studies have demonstrated that linezolid is an effective treatment for patients with nosocomial pneumonia, for hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and for patients with complicated skin or soft tissue infections (sstis). in these studies, linezolid was as effective as established treatments,  including third-generation cephalosporins in patients with pneumonia, and oxacillin in patients with complicated sstis. oral linezolid 400 or 600mg twice daily was as effective as clarithromycin 250mg twice daily or cefpodoxime proxetil 200mg twice daily in the treatment of patients with uncomplicated sstis  or community-acquired pneumonia. linezolid is a generally well tolerated drug. the most frequently reported adverse events in linezolid recipients were diarrhoea, headache, nausea and vomiting. thrombocytopenia was also documented in a small proportion (about 2%) of patients treated with the drug. conclusions: linezolid has good activity against gram-positive bacteria, particularly multidrug resistant strains of s. aureus (including gisa), enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis (including vre). in controlled clinical trials, linezolid was as  effective as vancomycin in eradicating infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp. and has demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by vre. as the level of resistance to vancomycin increases among s. aureus and enterococci, linezolid is poised to play an important role in the management of serious gram-positive infections.

TI  == linezolid: an oxazolidinone antimicrobial agent.
AB  == background: linezolid is the first oxazolidinone anti-infective agent marketed in the united states. it is indicated for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia, complicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by methicillin-sensitive or methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and other susceptible organisms, and  vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium infections. it also is indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by methicillin-sensitive s. aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, and community-acquired pneumonia caused by penicillin-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae. objective: this article reviews the pharmacologic properties and clinical usefulness of linezolid. methods: using the terms linezolid, pnu-100766, and oxazolidinone, we  performed a literature search of the following databases: medline (1966 to september 2000), healthstar (1993 to september 2000), iowa drug information service (1966 to september 2000), international pharmaceutical abstracts (1970 to september 2000), pharmaprojects (january 2000 version), and meeting abstracts of  the infectious diseases society of america and the interscience conference on antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy (1996 to 2000). results: linezolid has a unique structure and mechanism of action, which targets protein synthesis at an exceedingly early stage. consequently, cross-resistance with other commercially available antimicrobial agents is unlikely. it is primarily effective against gram-positive bacteria. to date, resistance to linezolid has been reported in patients infected with enterococci. the pharmacokinetic parameters of linezolid in adults are not altered by hepatic or renal function, age, or sex to an extent  requiring dose adjustment. linezolid is metabolized via morpholine ring oxidation, which is independent of the cytochrome p450 (cyp450) enzyme system; as a result, linezolid is unlikely to interact with medications that stimulate or inhibit cyp450 enzymes. compassionate-use trials and other clinical studies involving mainly adult hospitalized patients with gram-positive infections have shown that linezolid administered intravenously or orally is effective in a variety of nosocomial and community-acquired infections, including those caused by resistant gram-positive organisms. reported adverse effects include thrombocytopenia. diarrhea, headache, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, constipation, rash, and dizziness. preliminary pharmacoeconomic data indicate that a significantly higher percentage of patients receiving linezolid therapy versus comparator could be discharged from the hospital by day 7 (p = 0.005). conclusions: linezolid appears to be effective while maintaining an acceptable tolerability profile. due to the risk of bacterial resistance, linezolid should be reserved for the treatment of documented serious vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections.

AB  == rwj-54428 (mc-02,479) is a new cephalosporin with a high level of activity against gram-positive bacteria. in a broth microdilution susceptibility test against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), rwj-54428 was as active as vancomycin, with an mic at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)) of 2 microg/ml. for coagulase-negative staphylococci, rwj-54428 was 32  times more active than imipenem, with an mic(90) of 2 microg/ml. rwj-54428 was active against s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides (rwj-54428 mic range, < or = 0.0625 to 1 microg/ml). rwj-54428 was eight times more potent than  methicillin and cefotaxime against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mic(90), 0.5 microg/ml). for ampicillin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant and high-level aminoglycoside-resistant strains), rwj-54428  had an mic(90) of 0.125 microg/ml. rwj-54428 was also active against enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-, gentamicin-, and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. the potency against enterococci correlated with ampicillin susceptibility; rwj-54428 mics ranged between < or = 0.0625 and 1 microg/ml for ampicillin-susceptible strains and 0.125 and 8 microg/ml for ampicillin-resistant strains. rwj-54428 was more active than penicillin g and cefotaxime against penicillin-resistant, -intermediate, and -susceptible strains of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90)s, 0.25, 0.125, and < or = 0.0625 microg/ml, respectively). rwj-54428 was only marginally active against most gram-negative bacteria; however, significant activity was observed against haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis (mic(90)s, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). this survey of the susceptibilities of more than 1,000 multidrug-resistant gram-positive isolates to rwj-54428 indicates that this new cephalosporin has the potential to be useful in the treatment of infections due to gram-positive bacteria, including strains resistant to currently available antimicrobials.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of quinupristin/dalfopristin tested against gram-positive cocci from latin america: results from the global smart (gsmart) surveillance study.
AB  == gram-positive cocci are important causes of both nosocomial and community-acquired infections, and antimicrobial resistance among these pathogens has become an important problem worldwide. since resistance among these organisms can vary substantially by geographic location, we conducted a multicenter surveillance study with isolates from five latin american countries (15 medical centers). quinupristin/dalfopristin (formerly rp-59500) is a novel streptogramin  combination with focused activity against gram-positive cocci, many exhibiting emerging resistance. the in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin and 12 other antimicrobial agents were evaluated against 1,948 strains including staphylococcus aureus (747 strains), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons;446 strains), enterococci (429 strains), and various streptococcus spp. (326 strains). oxacillin resistance was observed in 41% of s. aureus (mic, <e; 2 microg/ml or >e; 13 mm) and 40% of cons (mic, <e; 0.25 microg/ml or >e; 18 mm). vancomycin, teicoplanin, and quinupristin/dalfopristin (mic(90), 0.25 - 1 mg/ml)  remained effective against all strains, but cross-resistance was high among other tested drugs. the quinupristin/dalfopristin mic(50) for streptococcus pneumoniae  and other streptococci was only 0.5 mg/ml (13% to 28% were penicillin-resistant;  12% to 22% were macrolide-resistant). enterococci demonstrated variable inhibition by quinupristin/dalfopristin depending upon identification and the susceptibility testing method used. the demonstrated quinupristin/dalfopristin activity against enterococcus faecium was confirmed, but potential species identification errors with various commercial systems continue to confuse susceptibility statistics, even though some strains of e. faecium confirmed by pcr-based or other molecular identification techniques did have quinupristin/dalfopristin mics of >e; 4 microg/ml. most important, glycopeptide-resistant enterococci are rapidly emerging in latin america, and quinupristin/dalfopristin appears active against many of these isolates as well as having potency against nearly all staphylococci and streptococci tested at <e; 2 microg/ml or having a zone diameter of >e; 16 mm. comparisons to gsmart results from other continents show nearly identical quinupristin/dalfopristin activity for each gram-positive species tested. these results define the role of quinupristin/dalfopristin in latin american medical centers and provide a benchmark for future in vitro comparisons.

TI  == linezolid pharmacia corp.
AB  == linezolid is an oxazolidinone developed by pharmacia (formerly pharmacia & upjohn) for the treatment of multi-resistant gram-positive infections [187765,317456]. it binds to ribosomal 50s subunits, most likely within domain v  within the 23s rrna peptidyl transferase and a secondary interaction with the 30s subunit. this results in inhibition of the initiation of protein translation at an early point, which is probably n-formylmethionyl-trna [335843]. no direct action on dna or rna synthesis has been observed [220169]. linezolid resistance due to a 23s rrna mutation may emerge in enterococci during therapy with this antimicrobial, and may be associated with clinical failure [368652]. following fda approval, linezolid was launched in may 2000 [368526,368652]. in april 2000,  the fda approved linezolid injection, tablets and oral suspension for the treatment of patients with infections caused by gram-positive bacteria. it is indicated for adults in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia, community-acquired pneumonia (cap), complicated and uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vre faecium and penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae [363503]. the fda, however, did not grant pharmacia indications for linezolid in the treatment of cap due to either penicillin-resistant s aureus (prsa) or mrsa. in may 2000, merrill lynch predicted sales for 2000 to be us $50 million, rising to us $760 million in 2004  [366910]. in february 2000, p&u predicted that peak sales of the drug had the potential to reach in excess of us $750 million [358429]. in february 1999, morgan stanley dean witter predicted sales of us $40 million in 2000 rising to us $275 million in 2005 [319855]. in december 1998, deutsche bank predicted sales of us $100 million in 2000 rising to us $300 million in 2002 [316769].

TI  == in vitro and in vivo properties of ro 63-9141, a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  == ro 63-9141 is a new member of the pyrrolidinone-3-ylidenemethyl cephem series of  cephalosporins. its antibacterial spectrum was evaluated against significant gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens in comparison with those of reference drugs, including cefotaxime, cefepime, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin. ro 63-9141 showed high antibacterial in vitro activity against gram-positive bacteria except ampicillin-resistant enterococci, particularly vancomycin-resistant strains of enterococcus faecium. its mic at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited  (mic(90)) for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was 4 microg/ml. ro 63-9141 was bactericidal against mrsa. development of resistance to the new compound in mrsa was not observed. ro 63-9141 was more potent than cefotaxime against penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) = 2 microg/ml). it was active against ceftazidime-susceptible strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and  against enterobacteriaceae except proteus vulgaris and some isolates producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. the basis for the antibacterial spectrum of ro 63-9141 lies in its affinity to essential penicillin-binding proteins, including  pbp 2' of mrsa, and its stability towards beta-lactamases. the in vivo findings were in accordance with the in vitro susceptibilities of the pathogens. these data suggest the potential utility of ro 63-9141 for the therapy of infections caused by susceptible pathogens, including mrsa. since insufficient solubility of ro 63-9141 itself precludes parenteral administration in humans, a water-soluble  prodrug, ro 65-5788, is considered for development.

TI  == ability of laboratories to detect emerging antimicrobial resistance: proficiency  testing and quality control results from the world health organization's external quality assurance system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  == the accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility data submitted by microbiology laboratories to national and international surveillance systems has been debated  for a number of years. to assess the accuracy of data submitted to the world health organization by users of the whonet software, the centers for disease control and prevention distributed six bacterial isolates representing key antimicrobial-resistance phenotypes to approximately 130 laboratories, all but one of which were outside of the united states, for antimicrobial susceptibility  testing as part of the world health organization's external quality assurance system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. each laboratory also was asked to submit 10 consecutive quality control values for several key organism-drug combinations. most laboratories were able to detect methicillin (oxacillin) resistance in staphylococcus aureus, high-level vancomycin resistance in enterococcus faecium, and resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins in klebsiella pneumoniae. many laboratories, particularly those using disk diffusion tests, had difficulty in recognizing reduced susceptibility to penicillin in an isolate of streptococcus pneumoniae. the most difficult phenotype for laboratories to detect was reduced susceptibility to vancomycin in an isolate of  staphylococcus epidermidis. the proficiency testing challenge also included a request for biochemical identification of a gram-negative bacillus, which most laboratories recognized as enterobacter cloacae. although only a small subset of  laboratories have submitted their quality control data, it is clear that many of  these laboratories generate disk diffusion results for oxacillin when testing s.  aureus atcc 25923 and s. pneumoniae atcc 49619 that are outside of the acceptable quality control range. the narrow quality control range for vancomycin also proved to be a challenge for many of the laboratories submitting data; approximately 27% of results were out of range. thus, it is important to establish the proficiency of laboratories submitting data to surveillance systems in which the organisms are tested locally, particularly for penicillin resistance in pneumococci and glycopeptide resistance in staphylococci.

TI  == use of preclinical data for selection of a phase ii/iii dose for evernimicin and  identification of a preclinical mic breakpoint.
AB  == one of the most challenging issues in the design of phase ii/iii clinical trials  of antimicrobial agents is dose selection. the choice is often based on preclinical data from pharmacokinetic (pk) studies with animals and healthy volunteers but is rarely linked directly to the target organisms except by the mic, an in vitro measure of antimicrobial activity with many limitations. it is the thesis of this paper that rational dose-selection decisions can be made on the basis of the pharmacodynamics (pds) of the test agent predicted by a mathematical model which uses four data sets: (i) the distribution of mics for clinical isolates, (ii) the distribution of the values of the pk parameters for the test drug in the population, (iii) the pd target(s) developed from animal models of infection, and (iv) the protein binding characteristics of the test drug. in performing this study with the new anti-infective agent evernimicin, we  collected a large number (n = 4,543) of recent clinical isolates of gram-positive pathogens (streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, and staphylococcus aureus) and determined the mics using e-test methods  (ab biodisk, stockholm, sweden) for susceptibility to evernimicin. population pk  data were collected from healthy volunteers (n = 40) and patients with hypoalbuminemia (n = 12), and the data were analyzed by using npem iii. pd targets were developed with a neutropenic murine thigh infection model with three target pathogens: s. pneumoniae (n = 5), e. faecalis (n = 2), and s. aureus (n =  4). drug exposure or the ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve/mic (auc/mic) was found to be the best predictor of microbiological efficacy. there were three possible microbiological results: stasis of the initial inoculum at 24 h (10(7) cfu), log killing (pathogen dependent, ranging from 1 to 3 log(10)), or  90% maximal killing effect (90% e(max)). the levels of protein binding in humans  and mice were similar. the pk and pd of 6 and 9 mg of evernimicin per kg of body  weight were compared; the population values for the model parameters and population covariance matrix were used to generate five monte carlo simulations with 200 subjects each. the fractional probability of attaining the three pd targets was calculated for each dose and for each of the three pathogens. all differences in the fractional probability of attaining the target auc/mic in this pd model were significant. for s. pneumoniae, the probability of attaining all three pd targets was high for both doses. for s. aureus and enterococci, there were increasing differences between the 6- and 9-mg/kg evernimicin doses for reaching the 2 log killing (s. aureus), 1 log killing (enterococci), or 90% e(max) auc/mic targets. this same approach may also be used to set preliminary in vitro mic breakpoints.

TI  == susceptibility of gram-positive cocci from 25 uk hospitals to antimicrobial agents including linezolid. the linezolid study group.
AB  == the prevalence of antibiotic resistance amongst gram-positive cocci from 25 uk hospitals was studied over an 8 month period in 1999. a total of 3770 isolates were tested by the sentinel laboratories using the etest; these bacteria comprised 1000 pneumococci, 1005 staphylococcus aureus, 769 coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) and 996 enterococci. to ensure quality, 10% of the isolates were retested centrally, as were any found to express unusual resistance patterns. the prevalence of penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) varied widely amongst the sentinel laboratories. the resistance rates to methicillin among s. aureus and cns were 19.2 and 38.9%, respectively, with mrsa  rates in individual sentinel sites ranging from 0 to 43%. no glycopeptide resistance was seen in s. aureus, but 6.5% of cns isolates were teicoplanin resistant and 0.5% were vancomycin resistant. vancomycin resistance was much more frequent among enterococcus faecium (24.1%) than e. faecalis (0.5%) (p<0.05), with most resistant isolates carrying vana. the rate of penicillin resistance in  pneumococci was 8.9%, and this resistance was predominantly intermediate (7.9%),  with only six hospitals reporting isolates with high level resistance. the prevalence of erythromycin resistance among pneumococci was 12.3%, with the majority of resistant isolates having the macrolide efflux mechanism mediated by  mefe. all the organisms tested were susceptible to linezolid with mics in the range 0.12-4 mg/l. the modal mics of linezolid were 1 mg/l for cns and pneumococci, and 2 mg/l for s. aureus and enterococci. linezolid was the most potent agent tested against gram-positive cocci, including multiresistant strains, and as such may prove a valuable therapeutic option for the management of gram-positive infections in hospitals.

TI  == evidence for horizontal gene transfer in evolution of elongation factor tu in enterococci.
AB  == the elongation factor tu, encoded by tuf genes, is a gtp binding protein that plays a central role in protein synthesis. one to three tuf genes per genome are  present, depending on the bacterial species. most low-g+c-content gram-positive bacteria carry only one tuf gene. we have designed degenerate pcr primers derived from consensus sequences of the tuf gene to amplify partial tuf sequences from 17 enterococcal species and other phylogenetically related species. the amplified dna fragments were sequenced either by direct sequencing or by sequencing cloned  inserts containing putative amplicons. two different tuf genes (tufa and tufb) were found in 11 enterococcal species, including enterococcus avium, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus dispar, enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus malodoratus, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus pseudoavium, and enterococcus raffinosus. for  the other six enterococcal species (enterococcus cecorum, enterococcus columbae,  enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus sulfureus, enterococcus saccharolyticus, and  enterococcus solitarius), only the tufa gene was present. based on 16s rrna gene  sequence analysis, the 11 species having two tuf genes all have a common ancestor, while the six species having only one copy diverged from the enterococcal lineage before that common ancestor. the presence of one or two copies of the tuf gene in enterococci was confirmed by southern hybridization. phylogenetic analysis of tuf sequences demonstrated that the enterococcal tufa gene branches with the bacillus, listeria, and staphylococcus genera, while the enterococcal tufb gene clusters with the genera streptococcus and lactococcus. primary structure analysis showed that four amino acid residues encoded within the sequenced regions are conserved and unique to the enterococcal tufb genes and the tuf genes of streptococci and lactococcus lactis. the data suggest that an ancestral streptococcus or a streptococcus-related species may have horizontally  transferred a tuf gene to the common ancestor of the 11 enterococcal species which now carry two tuf genes.

TI  == a novel is-like element frequently inserted in a putative virulence regulator in  bovine mastitis isolates of streptococcus dysgalactiae.
AB  == streptococcus dysgalactiae, a lancefield group c streptococcus, is commonly isolated from bovine mastitis. we recently identified a putative regulon in two s. dysgalactiae strains, 8215 and epi9, consisting of two consecutive genes, dmg  and dem, coding for a possible regulatory protein and an m-like protein with fibrinogen- and igg-binding-properties, respectively. during these studies a short sequence homologous to an is element was found to be inserted in the dmg gene of strain 8215. the present investigation describes the complete sequence of this is-like element, named issdy1, which consists of 1218 bp and contains two orfs, flanked by imperfect repeats. the nucleotide sequence of the is-like element shows 82% identity to the previously reported sequence of is199 from streptococcus mutans v403. the deduced amino acid sequences of the orfs also revealed high homology to transposases from is elements in enterococcus faecium,  escherichia coli, and shigella dysenteriae, all belonging to the is3 family. we studied the distribution of issdy1 in 57 s. dysgalactiae isolates using pcr analysis with specific primers derived from the is element. ninety-eight percent  of the isolates contained the issdy1 element. surprisingly, in the majority of studied strains a copy of the is-like element was found to be inserted in the dmg gene, a putative virulence regulator.

TI  == in vitro activity of monoclonal and recombinant yeast killer toxin-like antibodies against antibiotic-resistant gram-positive cocci.
AB  == background: monoclonal (mabkt) and recombinant single-chain (scfvkt) anti-idiotypic antibodies were produced to represent the internal image of a yeast killer toxin (kt) characterized by a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity, including gram-positive cocci. pathogenic eukaryotic and prokaryotic microorganisms, such as candida albicans, pneumocystis carinii, and a multidrug-resistant strain of mycobacterium tuberculosis, presenting specific, although yet undefined, kt-cell wall receptors (ktr), have proven to be killed in vitro by mabkt and scfvkt. mabkt and scfvkt exert a therapeutic effect in vivo in experimental models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis by mimicking the functional activity of protective antibodies naturally produced in humans against ktr of infecting microorganisms. the swelling tide of concern over increasing bacterial  resistance to antibiotic drugs gives the impetus to develop new therapeutic compounds against microbial threat. thus, the in vitro bactericidal activity of mabkt and scfvkt against gram-positive, drug-resistant cocci of major epidemiological interest was investigated. materials and methods: mabkt and scfvkt generated by hybridoma and dna recombinant technology from the spleen lymphocytes of mice immunized with a kt-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mab kt4) were used in a conventional colony forming unit (cfu) assay to determine, from a qualitative point of view, their bactericidal activity against staphylococcus aureus, s. haemolyticus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae strains. these bacterial strains are characterized by different patterns of resistance to antibiotics, including methicillin, vancomycin, and penicillin. results: according to the experimental conditions adopted, no bacterial isolate proved to be resistant to the activity of mabkt and scfvkt. conclusions: scfvkt exerted a microbicidal activity against multidrug resistant bacteria, which may represent the basis for the drug modeling of new antibiotics with broad antibacterial spectra to tackle the emergence of microbial resistance.

TI  == effect of probiotic bacteria on prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses in vitro.
AB  == the proliferation of yeasts in the mixed bacterial and fungal biofilms colonising silicone rubber voice prostheses in laryngectomised patients is the main cause of malfunctioning of the valve mechanism on the oesophageal side of the prostheses.  indwelling voice prostheses usually have to be replaced every 3-4 months. the consumption of probiotic bacteria is largely motivated by health claims related to the urogenital and lower digestive tract, but not to the upper digestive tract. the present study examined the influence of probiotic bacteria on the prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses, as formed in a modified robbins device. exposure of oropharyngeal biofilms on voice prostheses to suspensions of bifidobacterium infantis 420 or enterococcus faecium 603 did not significantly reduce the number of yeasts in the biofilm. however, suspensions of lactobacillus fermentum b54, l. rhamnosus 744 or l. lactis cremoris sk11 led to a reduction in the number of yeasts harvested from the voice prostheses. suspensions of l. casei shirota and streptococcus thermophilus b significantly reduced the number of yeasts in the biofilm to 39% and 33%, respectively. the reduction brought about in yeast prevalence in the mixed biofilm was greatest by exposure to a suspension of l. lactis 53, with yeast prevalence only 4% of the control. in conclusion, the study demonstrated that the prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice  prostheses might be controlled by consumption of probiotic bacteria.

AB  == gemifloxacin (gemi), formerly sb-265805 and lb20304, is a newer fluoroquinolone with broad-spectrum activity against a wide variety of bacterial pathogens. the present investigation extended earlier observations by sampling an additional 6790 gram-positive organisms from more than 50 medical centres on three continents. the reference broth microdilution method with recommended medium supplements was used throughout. selected results (number strains tested; mic90 for gemi/trovafloxacin in mg/l; % < or = 1 mg/l for gemi/trovafloxacin) were: staphylococcus aureus (3672; 2/2; 86/85), s. epidermidis (404; 1/>4; 92/71), enterococcus faecalis (630; 4/>4; 76/66), e. faecium (216; > 4/>4; 15/11), streptococcus pneumoniae (300; 0.06/0.25; 100/97), beta-haemolytic streptococci (150; 0.06/0.25; 100/100) and viridans group streptococci (150; 0.12/0.25; 99/97). gemifloxacin appeared equal or superior to trovafloxacin in its overall gram-positive spectrum of activity pending a choice of the susceptible breakpoint concentration. continued in vitro, pharmacodynamic and clinical investigations of gemifloxacin appear warranted.

TI  == in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against gram-positive bacteria haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis in taiwan.
AB  == background: over the past decade, resistance of gram-positive cocci to common antibiotics has steadily increased. new antibacterial agents that are active against multidrug-resistant pathogens are urgently needed for the treatment of these pathogens. we conducted an in vitro study on the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin and other antibiotics against common clinical isolates  of the gram-positive cocci, haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis. methods: the agar dilution method described by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of bacterial isolates from clinical specimens obtained from patients in a medical center. results: all staphylococcus aureus isolates were inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin (< or = 2 micrograms/ml). the mic90s were  1 mg/ml for both methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s aureus. quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibited streptococci at a concentration of 1 microgram/ml or less. the mic90s were 1 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, s pyogenes and viridans streptococci. ampicillin-resistant enterococcus faecium was inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin at 0.5 to 4 micrograms/ml, with an mic90 of 1 microgram/ml. h influenzae was inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin at 0.25 to 8 micrograms/ml, with an mic90 of 4 micrograms/ml. b catarrhalis was inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin at 0.25 to 1 microgram/ml, with an mic90 of 1 microgram/ml. conclusions: we found that quinupristin/dalfopristin showed good in vitro activity against staphylococci, streptococci and b catarrhalis but less in vitro activity against h influenzae.

TI  == a new rapid automated method for the detection of listeria from environmental swabs and sponges.
AB  == many food and meat processors test environmental swabs and sponges to confirm the absence of listeria spp. spectral pattern changes in a liquid growth medium, resulting from esculin hydrolysis by listeria in contaminated swabs and sponges,  were automatically monitored by the biosys instrument in a semifluid layer (sfl). the blackening of sfl in modified mox broth resulted in sharply declining curves, which were easily detected by the instrument. the instrument detected all nine strains of listeria monocytogenes tested. none of the gram negative organisms (proteus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas, citrobacter and yersinia) were detected  by the system, nor were most gram positive organisms, including bacillus, streptococcus, and lactobacillus strains, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis, which hydrolyze esculin, produced black colonies on palcam and oxford media and were also detected in the system. a total of 122 sponges and swabs collected at food processing plants were evaluated by this method. of these, 99 were negative, and 11 were positive. l. innocua was the dominant listeria species in these environmental samples. good correlation was obtained between numbers of listeria and detection times of esculin hydrolysis: 1000 cfu/swab were detected in 10-13 h, whereas 1-10 cfu/swab were detected in less than 22 h. the total assay time was 26 h.

TI  == use of pcr with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == we have designed a universal pcr capable of amplifying a portion of the 16s rrna  gene of eubacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis,  streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, mycobacterium tuberculosis, legionella pneumophila, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. the sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most pcr products generated by haeiii digestion were different. pcr products from s. aureus and s. epidermidis could not be digested by haeiii but yielded different patterns when they were digested with mnli. pcr products from s. pneumoniae, e. faecium, and e. faecalis yielded the same haeiii digestion pattern but could be differentiated by alui digestion. pcr  products from e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and e. cloacae also had the  same haeiii digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with ddei  or bstbi. this universal pcr could detect as few as 10 e. coli or 250 s. aureus organisms. compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal pcr for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. these results suggest that this universal pcr coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.

TI  == activity of macrolides, lincosamines, streptogramins and fluoroquinolones against streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococci isolates from the western hemisphere: example of international surveillance (sentry antimicrobial surveillance program  )in the development of new drugs.
AB  == resistance among commonly isolated gram-positive cocci have compromised the available therapeutic regimens and require structured monitoring at the local, regional, national, and international levels. two popular treatment classes of antimicrobials (macrolides-lincosamines-streptogramins [mls], fluoroquinolones) have been tested against 3, 049 isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococci from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program. the strains were  obtained from clinical cases in hospitals in the united states, canada, and six nations (10 medical centers )in latin america. mls and fluoroquinolone compounds  had moderate activity against vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis only (gatifloxacin, and trovafloxacin mic(50), 0.5 microg/ml), and quinupristin/dalfopristin was potent only against e.faecium isolates (mic(90), 1  microg/ml(-2) microg/ml). when tested against pneumococci, gatifloxacin, trovafloxacin, sparfloxacin, and quinupristin/dalfopristin (mic(90), < or = 1 microg/ml)were most active among the newer drugs, but vancomycin and clindamycinn inhibited > or =99.8% and 84.7% to 99.1% of strains, respectively. these results  from a global resistance monitoring program should encourage rapid drug development. based on in vitro sensitivity testing, they indicate a promising role for the treatment of emerging resistant gram-positive cocci. the clinical role for each new agent will depend on safety profiles, rates of administration,  and other issues identified during development in the clinical trials process.

AB  == objective: to investigate the effect of a probiotic milk product containing the culture causido(r) and of two alternative products on risk factors for cardiovascular disease in overweight and obese subjects. design: an 8 week randomized, double-blind, placebo- and compliance-controlled, parallel study. subjects: seventy healthy, weight-stable, overweight and obese (25.0<bmi<37.5 kg/m2) males (n=20) and females (n=50), 18-55 y old, were randomly assigned into  five groups. intervention: four groups consumed 450 ml fermented milk products (yoghurt) daily. group 1: a yoghurt fermented with two strains of streptococcus thermophilus and two strains of lactobacillus acidophilus (stla). group 2: a placebo yoghurt fermented with delta-acid-lactone (py). group 3: a yoghurt fermented with two strains of streptococcus thermophilus and one strain of lactobacillus rhamnosus (stlr). group 4: a yoghurt fermented with one strain of enterococcus faecium and two strains of streptococcus thermophilus (causido(r) culture), gaio(r) (g). the dietary composition of the yoghurt was otherwise similar. the fifth group was given two placebo pills (pp) daily. results: when comparing all five treatment groups, unadjusted for changes in body weight, no statistical effects were observed in week 8 in the g-group on low density lipoproteins (ldl)-cholesterol (p=0.29). after adjustment for small changes in body weight, ldl-cholesterol decreased by 8.4% (0.26+/-0.10 mmol/l; p<0.05) and fibrinogen increased (0.74+/-0.32 mmol/l; p<0.05) after 8 weeks in the g-group. this was significantly different from the group consuming chemically fermented yoghurt and the group consuming placebo pills (p<0.05). after 8 weeks, systolic blood pressure was significantly more reduced in the stla and g-group compared to stlr. no other differences were found. conclusion: the causido(r) culture reduced ldl-cholesterol and increased fibrinogen in the overweight subjects at a 450 ml consumption daily for 8 weeks. the effect on ldl-cholesterol confirms previous studies. an immunostimulation by one of the strains in the product might explain  the effect on fibrinogen in the g-group. sponsorship: md foods a/s, denmark.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of mefloquine and a series of related compounds.
AB  == mefloquine was found to have bactericidal activity against methicillin- and fluoroquinolone-susceptible and -resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis and gentamicin- and vancomycin-resistant strains of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. the mics were 16 microg/ml, and the minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) were 16 to 32 microg/ml. these concentrations cannot be achieved in serum. mefloquine was active at a more achievable concentration against penicillin-susceptible and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, with mics of 0.2 to 1.5 microg/ml. mefloquine was not active against gram-negative bacteria and yeasts. in an attempt to find more active derivatives, 400 mefloquine-related compounds were selected from the chemical inventory of the walter reed army institute of research. we identified a series of compounds containing a piperidine methanol group attached to pyridine,  quinoline, and benzylquinoline ring systems. these had activities similar to that of mefloquine against s. pneumoniae but were far more active against other gram-positive bacteria (mics for staphylococci, 0.8 to 6.3 microg/ml). they had activities similar to that of amphotericin b against candida spp. and cryptococcus neoformans. combinations of the compounds with gentamicin and vancomycin were additive against staphylococci and pneumococci. the mic and mbc of gentamicin were decreased by four- to eightfold when this drug was combined with limiting dilutions of the compounds. there was no antagonism with other antimicrobial drugs. the compounds were rapidly bactericidal. they appear to act  by disrupting cell membranes. combinations of the compounds with aminoglycoside antibiotics may have potential for therapeutic use.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility and frequency of occurrence of clinical blood isolates in europe from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, 1997 and 1998.
AB  == as part of the european arm of the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, 25  european university hospitals referred 9613 blood isolates for in vitro testing against >20 antimicrobial agents. escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae were the 5 most frequent isolates and accounted for two-thirds of all  referrals, with minor regional variation. of these, approximately 0.36% of e. coli and 16.7% of k. pneumoniae isolates proved to be potential extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers, and their incidence clearly varied regionally. quinolone resistance was detected among gram-negative species; in particular, p.  aeruginosa and acinetobacter species. considerable regional variation was observed in the incidences of methicillin resistance in s. aureus and penicillin  resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae. the incidence of vancomycin resistance in enterococci was relatively low overall and primarily associated with enterococcus faecium. however, extrapolation of these data to smaller and nonteaching hospitals should be undertaken with caution, since resistance rates may be lower  in these facilities.

AB  == rates of resistance for two consecutive years for 28 centres (10 teaching, nine associate teaching and nine district general hospitals) in the uk were compared.  combined rates of resistance for each of the hospital types of staphylococcus aureus to methicillin revealed an increase in the rate of resistance in teaching  hospitals (12.5% year 1, 23.5% year 2), but, for associate teaching and district  general hospitals rates fell (associate teaching 19.1% year 1, 11.9% year 2; district general 16.5% year 1 and 11.3% year 2). using conventional methodology to determine mics, no strain was considered to have reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. among coagulase-negative staphylococci, increased resistance was observed for staphylococcus epidermidis to rifampicin, for staphylococcus haemolyticus to clindamycin, for staphylococcus saprophyticus to penicillin and for staphylococcus spp. to clindamycin, methicillin and rifampicin. for streptococcus pneumoniae an upward trend in low-level resistance to penicillin was observed (18 of the 28 centres), however, for high-level resistance the trend was in the opposite direction (only four centres showed an increase). for enterococcus faecalis there was a trend to a fall in levels of resistance, the only exception being an increase in high-level gentamicin resistance (10.5% year  1, 15.1% year 2, p = 0.0388). for enterococcus faecium rates of resistance were not significantly different except for increases in resistance to nitrofurantoin  and rifampicin.

TI  == quinupristin/dalfopristin: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin is the first parenteral streptogramin antibacterial agent, and is a 30:70 (w/w) ratio of 2 semisynthetic pristinamycin derivatives. the combination has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref), drug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococci, clostridium perfringens and peptostreptococcus spp. the combination also has good activity against selected gram-negative respiratory tract pathogens including moraxella catarrhalis, legioniella pneumophila and mycoplasma pneumoniae. quinupristin/dalfopristin has poor activity against e. faecalis. the  combination is bactericidal against staphylococci and streptococci, although constitutive erythromycin resistance can affect its activity. as for many other agents, quinupristin/dalfopristin is generally bacteriostatic against e. faecium. in patients with methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) or vref infections participating in prospective emergency-use trials, quinupristin/dalfopristin 7.5  mg/kg every 8 or 12 hours achieved clinical or bacteriological success in > or =64% of patients. emergence of resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin was uncommon (4% of patients) in those with vref infections. quinupristin/dalfopristin 7.5 mg/kg 8- or 12-hourly also achieved similar clinical success rates to comparator agents in patients with presumed gram-positive complicated skin and skin structure infections or nosocomial pneumonia (administered in combination with aztreoman) in 3 large multicentre randomised trials. systemic adverse events associated with quinupristin/dalfopristin include gastrointestinal events (nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea), rash and pruritus. myalgias and arthralgias also occur at an overall  incidence of 1.3%, although higher rates (2.5 to 31%) have been reported in patients with multiple comorbidities. venous events are common if the drug is administered via a peripheral line; however, several management options (e.g. use of central venous access, increased infusion volume) may help to minimise their occurrence. hyperbilirubinaemia has been documented in 3.1% of quinupristin/dalfopristin recipients versus 1.3% of recipients of comparator agents. quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibits cytochrome p450 3a4 and therefore has  the potential to increase the plasma concentrations of substrates of this enzyme. conclusions: quinupristin/dalfopristin, the first parenteral streptogramin, offers a unique spectrum of activity against multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria. in serious gram-positive infections for which there are other treatment options available, the spectrum of activity and efficacy of quinupristin/ dalfopristin should be weighed against its tolerability and drug interaction profile. however, in vref or unresponsive mrsa infections, where few proven treatment options exist, quinupristin/dalfopristin should be considered as a treatment of choice for these seriously ill patients.

AB  == introduction: certain fermented dairy milk products may have beneficial effects on plasma cholesterol levels. however, a number of studies have produced conflicting results as to whether dietary supplementation by a probiotic dairy product containing the bacteria culture causido(r) reduces plasma cholesterol. objective: to conduct a meta-analysis of intervention studies to evaluate the effect of the causido(r) culture on plasma total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (ldl)-cholesterol. the probiotic milk product: the yoghurt product gaio(r) is fermented with causido(r), composed of one strain of enterococcus faecium (human species) with the proposed cholesterol-lowering effect, and two strains of streptococcus thermophilus. study inclusion and data extraction: six studies were identified from a literature search and from the yoghurt producer. all studies met the inclusion criteria. summary data for plasma concentrations of total cholesterol and ldl-cholesterol were extracted from the original publications or by personal request to the authors. data from 4-8 weeks of treatment duration was used. statistical analysis: we performed a traditional meta-analysis where mean differences between intervention and control of the pre-post changes in total cholesterol and ldl-cholesterol were calculated, as well as 95% confidence intervals (cis). results: in the six studies included in the meta-analysis, the gaio(r) interventions produced changes in total cholesterol above those of the control groups ranging from -0.02 to -1.02 mmol/l  and in ldl-cholesterol ranging from -0.02 to -1.15 mmol/l. after inclusion of an  open-label study, the meta-analysis of the double-blind studies showed that gaio(r) as compared to the control group changed total cholesterol by -0.22 mmol/l (95% ci: -0.35 to -0.08, p<0.01) and ldl-cholesterol by -0.20 mmol/l (95%  ci: -0.33 to -0.06, p<0.005). the outcome was essentially the same if all studies were included. conclusions: the present meta-analysis of controlled short-term intervention studies shows that the fermented yoghurt product produced a 4% decrease in total cholesterol and a 5% decrease in ldl-cholesterol when the open-label study is excluded. to demonstrate sustained effects on blood lipids, long-term studies are required. sponsorship: md foods a/s, denmark.

AB  == the in vitro activity of levofloxacin was investigated against 256 clinical strains of four gram-positive genera (staphylococcus, streptococcus, enterococcus, and listeria). ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were used as comparators. uniform susceptibility to levofloxacin was recorded among methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, streptococci other than streptococcus agalactiae, regardless of their being susceptible, intermediate, or resistant to  penicillin (s. pneumoniae) or erythromycin (s. pyogenes and s. pneumoniae), in enterococci other than enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium, and in listeria monocytogenes isolates. moreover, 1 of 22 s. agalactiae isolates and 1 of 19 e. faecium isolates was resistant, and 2 of 19 were intermediate. resistances to levofloxacin with mic90s in the resistance range were only observed in methicillin-resistant staphylococci and e. faecalis isolates. in any case, the mics of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were usually 2-4 times higher than those of levofloxacin. in time-kill assays using three test strains (a methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus isolate, a penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae isolate, and an e. faecalis isolate), the bactericidal activity of levofloxacin was greater than that of ciprofloxacin.

AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin (synercid) is a new injectable streptogramin antibiotic proposed for the treatment of severe antimicrobial infections, that has been shown to be active against gram-positive, multi-resistant cocci. we compared the  in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin with that of amoxycillin, ampicillin, penicillin, cefixime, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, erythromycin, imipenem, meropenem, oxacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, teicoplanin and vancomycin. the susceptibility of 37 staphylococcus aureus (14 ms, 23 mr), 26 staphylococcus epidermidis (16 ms, 10 mr), 20 streptococcus pneumoniae, 33 group  a streptococcus pyogenes, 15 streptococcus agalactiae, 10 enterococcus faecalis (1 vancomycin-resistant), 15 enterococcus faecium (9 van a) was evaluated. quinupristin/dalfopristin was active against all gram-positive species tested, including met-r s. aureus (mic < or = 2 mg/l), met-r s. epidermidis (mic < or = 2 mg/l), s. pneumoniae (mic < or = 1 mg/l), ery-r and ery-s streptococci (mic < or  = 1 mg/l). the strains of e. faecalis were generally less susceptible. time-kill  studies confirmed that quinupristin/dalfopristin at 4 x mic concentration showed  a complete bactericidal effect (3 log reduction) in about 4 6 h against all strains tested. a post-antibiotic effect (pae) of 3.9-5.2 h was observed at 4 x mic concentration of quinupristin/dalfopristin against staphylococci. a prolonged pae was obtained for s. pneumoniae (8 h), s. pyogenes (9 h) and s. agalactiae (7  h), while the shortest pae was seen for e. faecalis and e. faecium (about 4 h).

TI  == interspecies recombination between enterococci: genetic and phenotypic diversity  of vancomycin-resistant transconjugants.
AB  == handwerger and colleagues demonstrated that a particular clinical isolate of enterococcus faecium, designated guc, and here redesignated as gucr, can conjugatively transfer vancomycin resistance. the vancomycin resistance is encoded by a chromosomally born linked set of genes in the donor, designated the  vana cluster, to the chromosome of an e. faecalis recipient, jh2-2. here it is reported that an earlier isolate of e. faecium from the same patient who later harbored the vancomycin-resistant e. faecium gucr lacks the vana gene cluster but is otherwise similar (by smai chromosomal fingerprint and metabolic fingerprinting) to the vancomycin-resistant gucr. therefore, "gucs" is a strong suspect as the base strain for the clinical acquisition of the vana cluster present in gucr. thirteen laboratory-generated vana transconjugants derived from  conjugation between gucr and jh2-2 were subjected to further analysis, allowing a comparison between transfer in the laboratory and transfer that occurred in the clinical setting. surprisingly, each jh2-2 transconjugant had a unique constellation of abilities to oxidize various members of a panel of potential carbon sources. this pattern was stable for each transconjugant, and it was not changed by growing the strains with or without vancomycin. transconjugants had pulsed-field gel electrophoretic (pfge) patterns largely consistent with that of  jh2-2, the recipient in conjugation experiments. however, pfge analysis showed that a large but variable amount of dna, between 145 kb and 277 kb, was transferred into different transconjugants. the mechanism appears to be conjugative transposition in which new dna is added to the pre-existing genome rather than substituting for a segment in the recipient. mapping and hybridization studies of several transconjugants showed that each received similar, but not exactly the same, dna fragment of at least 30 kb from the donor. sequencing of 16s ribosomal genes was used to confirm that the recipient and donor strains used in transconjugation experiments were different species. sequence analysis was also used to consider the possibility that rrna operons might be mobilized in conjugation, but no evidence for the transfer of rdna operons was found. an apparent insertion sequence in e. faecium almost identical  to is 1485 and 57% sequence identity to is 199 of streptococcus mutans was found  in the region of dna transferred. the results imply new consequences of conjugative transfer and interspecies recombination.

TI  == prevalence of resistance to mls antibiotics in 20 european university hospitals participating in the european sentry surveillance programme. sentry participants  group.
AB  == macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin (mls) antibiotics are chemically distinct inhibitors of bacterial protein synthesis. resistance to mls antibiotics may be constitutive or inducible. the purpose of this study is to update our understanding of the prevalence of different forms of mls resistance in europe. the analysis of 3653 clinical pneumococcal, staphylococcal and enterococcal isolates exhibited an average percentage of 21.3% and 6.2% intermediate and high-level penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, 21.8% methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and 11% vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium. geographical differences in erythromycin and clindamycin resistance in isolates of s. pneumoniae and s. aureus strongly reflect geographical variations in susceptibility to penicillin and methicillin, respectively. a very narrow range of mics was obtained with quinupristin/dalfopristin, with no s. pneumoniae, s. aureus and e. faecium isolate having an mic of > 4 mg/l, indicating a possible role of quinupristin/dalfopristin in the treatment of infections by multi-resistant gram-positive bacteria.

AB  == investigations on emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref) which has recently been attracting attention, especially in the western countries, have been conducted in japan. a total of 1,239 isolates of e. faecium  were collected from 19 institutions during the period of april 1995 and june 1996, in the purpose of evaluating susceptibilities to variety of antimicrobial agents, including rp59500 and vancomycin (vcm), and detecting vancomycin-resistant genes (van genes). susceptibilities of penicillin-resistant  streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp) and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) were also studied. as a result, 2 isolates of e. faecium were found to be  moderately resistant to vcm showing mic of 8 micrograms/ml though the final identification in species level and the detection of van genes by pcr method have not been completed. on the other hand there detected no mrsa nor prsp showing moderately resistant or resistant to vcm. it was concluded that rp59500 and vcm possessed favorable activity against clinically isolated e. faecium, prsp and mrsa. among other species of enterococci, moderately resistant strains to vcm showing mic of 8 micrograms/ml were detected; 10 isolates of e. gallinarum, 4 of  e. casseliflavus and 2 of e. flavescens. in those isolates, vanc1 and vanc2 were  detected by pcr, and vanb was also detected in a isolates of e. gallinarum simultaneously.

AB  == antimicrobial resistance in gram-positive pathogens from 30 centres in the uk (ten teaching, ten associate teaching and ten district general hospitals) was studied over a 4 month period between october 1996 and january 1997. high-level resistance (hlr) and low-level resistance (llr) to penicillin amongst pneumococci was 3.3% and 3.4%, respectively. however, considerable variation in resistance rates was observed depending on geographical location (llr range 0-15.4% and hlr  range 0-30.8%). considerable variation in resistance rates was also observed for  staphylococcus aureus to methicillin, with rates ranging from 0% to 56.7% depending on locality. using conventional mic methodology, none of the isolates of s. aureus was considered as having reduced sensitivity to vancomycin. however, eight isolates grew on brain heart infusion agar containing vancomycin (4 mg/l) after prolonged incubation and are therefore worthy of further investigation by electron microscopy. with enterococcus faecalis, resistance rates were similar between the three types of hospital and only four isolates were considered resistant to glycopeptide antibiotics (one vana and three vanb phenotype).

AB  == to determine to what extent methodological differences affect susceptibility testing parameters for linezolid, mics and disk inhibition zones were compared using the methods described by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards and the british society for antimicrobial chemotherapy for 198 strains  of gram-positive cocci. zones were 4-5 mm larger by the british society for antimicrobial chemotherapy method, but mics did not differ, except for pneumococci, which were more sensitive when the british society for antimicrobial chemotherapy method was used. this is because incubation in co2 depresses the activity of linezolid against this species only. breakpoints for linezolid may need adjusting when testing is by other than national committee for clinical laboratory standards methods.

TI  == recent developments in streptogramin research.
AB  == the streptogramins are a class of antibiotics remarkable for their antibacterial  activity and their unique mechanism of action. these antibiotics are produced naturally, but the therapeutic use of the natural compounds is limited because they do not dissolve in water. new semisynthetic derivatives, in particular the injectable streptogramin quinupristin/dalfopristin, offer promise for treating the rising number of infections that are caused by multiply resistant bacteria. the streptogramins consist of two structurally unrelated compounds, group a and group b. the group a compounds are polyunsaturated macrolactones: the group b compounds are cyclic hexadepsipeptides. modifications of the group b components have been mainly performed on the 3-hydroxypicolinoyl, the 4-dimethylaminophenylalanine and the 4-oxo pipecolinic residues. semi-synthesis on this third residue led to the water-soluble derivative quinupristin. water-soluble group a derivatives were obtained by michael addition of aminothiols to the dehydroproline ring of pristinamycin iia. followed by oxidation of the intermediate sulfide into the sulfone derivatives (i.e., dalfopristin). water-soluble derivatives (both group a and group b) can now be obtained at the industrial scale. modified group b compounds are now also being produced by mutasynthesis, via disruption of the papa gene. mutasynthesis has proved particularly useful for producing pib, the group b component of the oral streptogramin rpr 106972. the streptogramins inhibit bacterial growth by disrupting the translation of mrna into protein. both the group a and group b compounds bind to the peptidyltransferase domain of the bacterial ribosome. the group a compounds interfere with the elongation of the polypeptide chain by preventing the binding of aa-trna to the ribosome and the formation of peptide bonds, while the b compounds stimulate the dissociation of the peptidyl-trna and  may also interfere with the release of the completed polypeptide by blocking its  access to the channel through which it normally leaves the ribosome. the synergy  between the group a and group b compounds appears to result from an enhanced affinity of the group b compounds for the ribosome. apparently, the group a compound induces a conformational change such that b compound binds with greater  affinity. the natural streptogramins are produced as mixtures of the group a and  b compounds, the combination of which is a more potent antibacterial agent than either type of compound alone. whereas the type a or type b compound alone has, in vitro and in animal models of infection, a moderate bacteriostatic activity, the combination of the two has strong bacteriostatic activity and often bactericidal activity. minimal inhibitory concentrations of quinupristin/dalfopristin range from 0.20 to 1 mg/l for streptococcus pneumonae,  from 0.25 to 2 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus and from 0.50 to 4 for enterococcus faecium, the principal target organisms of this drug. quinupristin/dalfopristin also has activity against mycoplasmas, neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenz, legionella spp. and moraxella catarrhalis. bacteria develop resistance  to the streptogramms by ribosomal modification, by producing inactivating enzymes, or by causing an efflux of the antibiotic. dimethylation of an adenine residue in rrna, a reaction that is catalyzed by a methylase encoded by the erm gene class, affects the binding of group b compounds (as well as the macrolides and lincosamides; hence, mlsb resistance), but group a and b compounds usually maintain their synergy and their bactericidal effect against mlsb-resistant strains. erm genes are widespread both geographically and throughout numerous bacterial genera. several types of enzymes (acetyltransferases, hydrolases) have  been identified that inactivate the group a or the group b compounds. genes involved in streptogramin efflux have so far been found only in staphylococci, particularly in coagulase-negative species

AB  == pexiganan, a 22-amino-acid antimicrobial peptide, is an analog of the magainin peptides isolated from the skin of the african clawed frog. pexiganan exhibited in vitro broad-spectrum antibacterial activity when it was tested against 3,109 clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative, anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. the pexiganan mic at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic90) was 32 micrograms/ml or less for staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., enterococcus faecium, corynebacterium spp., pseudomonas spp., acinetobacter spp., stenotrophomonas spp., certain species of the family enterobacteriaceae, bacteroides spp., peptostreptococcus spp., and propionibacterium spp. comparison  of the mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of pexiganan for 143 isolates representing 32 species demonstrated that for 92% of the isolates tested, mbcs were the same or within 1 twofold difference of the mics, consistent with a bactericidal mechanism of action. killing curve analysis showed that pexiganan killed pseudomonas aeruginosa rapidly, with 10(6) organisms/ml eliminated within 20 min of treatment with 16 micrograms of pexiganan per ml. no  evidence of cross-resistance to a number of other antibiotic classes was observed, as determined by the equivalence of the mic50s and the mic90s of pexiganan for strains resistant to oxacillin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, imipenem, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and clindamicin versus those for strains susceptible to these antimicrobial agents. attempts to generate resistance in several bacterial species through repeated passage with subinhibitory concentrations of pexiganan were unsuccessful. in conclusion, pexiganan exhibits  properties in vitro which make it an attractive candidate for development as a topical antimicrobial agent.

TI  == epidemiologic trends in nosocomial and community-acquired infections due to antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacteria: the role of streptogramins and other newer compounds.
AB  == the gram-positive cocci have clearly re-emerged as important pathogens world-wide in the past two decades. staphylococci, including the coagulase-negative staphylococci and staphylococcus aureus, and the enterococci account for approximately one-third of all blood stream infections and as much as 50% of nosocomial blood stream infections. although streptococcus pneumoniae is often considered a community-acquired pathogen, it is also an important cause of nosocomial infection. the hallmark of these gram-positive pathogens is increasing resistance to available antimicrobial agents. of particular note is resistance to glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin), aminoglycosides (high-level), and penicillins among the enterococci (especially e. faecium), resistance to penicillinase-resistant penicillins (oxacillin and methicillin) and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin) among staphylococci, and resistance to penicillin, other beta-lactams and macrolides among the pneumococci. the recent detection of decreased susceptibility to vancomycin among s. aureus is also quite ominous. in many instances the ability of the clinical laboratory to accurately characterize these resistant isolates is suboptimal, further compounding the problem. increased understanding of resistance mechanisms and correlations of resistance genes with the phenotypic expression of resistance has allowed for modifications and improvements of reference susceptibility tests  and interpretive breakpoints. new compounds for effective therapy of infection with multi-resistant gram-positive species are clearly needed. to this end, the streptogramin combination, quinupristin/dalfopristin, has demonstrated significant activity against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, penicillin-resistant streptococci, and vancomycin-resistant e. faecium. other candidate drugs including gram-positive active fluoroquinolones (clinafloxacin, grepafloxacin, moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, and trovafloxacin) and novel compounds such as the everninomicin derivatives (sch27899), ketolides, and oxazolidinones (linezolid) have been shown to be active against these organisms and are under rapid clinical development.

AB  == we report the identification of a new cell wall-associated protein of enterococcus faecalis. studies on the distribution of the gene encoding this novel surface protein, esp, reveal a significant (p < 0.001) enrichment in infection-derived e. faecalis isolates. interestingly, the esp gene was not identified in any of 34 clinical e. faecium isolates or in 4 other less pathogenic enterococcal species tested. analysis of the structural gene among various e. faecalis isolates reveals the existence of alternate forms of expression of the esp protein. the deduced primary structure of the esp protein from strain mmh594, inferred to be 1,873 amino acids (aa) with a predicted mass of approximately 202 kda, reveals a core region consisting of repeat units that make up 50% of the protein. esp bears global organizational similarity to the rib and c alpha proteins of group b streptococci. identity among esp, rib, and c alpha proteins is strikingly localized to a stretch of 13 aa within repeats of similar length. the high degree of conservation of this 13-residue sequence suggests that it plays an important role in the natural selection for this trait  among infection-derived e. faecalis and group b streptococcal isolates.

AB  == salmonella typhimurium colonizes the intestinal tract of poultry and causes food-borne illness in humans. reduction of s. typhimurium colonization in the intestinal tract of poultry reduces potential carcass contamination during slaughter. the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of an avian-specific probiotic and s. typhimurium-specific antibodies on the colonization of s. typhimurium in broilers and on body weights. broiler chicks were spray-vaccinated at the hatchery with the commercial product. avian pac plus, which contains lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus faecium, ad s. typhimurium-specific antibodies. at placement, these chicks were administered avian pac plus in the water. six hours postplacement, chicks were orally challenged with 1.8 x 10 (7) cfu of s. typhimurium. chicks were administered avian pac plus for two additional days postchallenge. chicks were evaluated for s. typhimurium colonization and shedding every 3 to 4 days for the first 2 weeks  and every 7 days for 6 weeks. the mean cecal and colonic concentration of s. typhimurium from the avian pac plus-treated group was significantly lower at day  31 (p = 0.0001), day 38 (p = 0.0005), and day 43 (p = 0.0001) than the nontreated control group. these results indicated that a combination of lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus faecium, and s typhimurium-specific antibodies have a  beneficial effect in reducing the colonization of s. typhimurium in market-aged broilers.

TI  == detection of bacteraemia in patients with fever and neutropenia using 16s rrna gene amplification by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == episodes of fever and neutropenia are common complications of treatment for cancer. the use of prophylactic and early empirical antibiotics has reduced mortality but decreases the sensitivity of diagnostic tests based on culture. the aim of this study was to determine the potential of a broad diagnostic approach (eubacterial) based on 16s rrna gene amplification and sequencing to augment cultural methods of diagnosis of bacteraemia in patients with fever and neutropenia in a regional paediatric oncology centre. one hundred eleven patient-episodes of fever and neutropenia were evaluated during the study period, 17 of which were associated with positive blood cultures, as follows: staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 6 episodes), enterococcus faecium (n = 2), streptococcus sanguis (n = 3), streptococcus mitis (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), micrococcus spp. (n = 1), and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 1). eubacterial polymerase chain reaction (pcr) detected bacterial dna in nine of 11  blood culture-positive episodes for which a sample was available for pcr; the species identified by sequence analysis were identical to those derived from the  conventional identification of the cultured isolates. bacterial dna was detected  in 20 episodes (21 bacterial sequences) associated with negative blood cultures,  18 of which occurred in patients who were receiving antibiotics at the time of sample collection. the species presumptively identified by partial 16s rrna gene  sequencing were as follows: pseudomonas spp. (n = 6 episodes), acinetobacter spp. (n =5 ); escherichia spp. (n = 3); moraxella spp. (n = 3); staphylococcus spp. (n = 2); neisseria spp. (n = 1); and bacillus spp. (n = 1). the results of this study suggest that molecular techniques can augment cultural methods in the diagnosis of bacteraemia in patients who have been treated with antibiotics.

TI  == evaluation of in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin and comparator antimicrobial agents against worldwide clinical trial and other laboratory isolates.
AB  == this report summarizes the activities of quinupristin/dalfopristin (q/d) and appropriate comparator antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, rifampin, teicoplanin, and vancomycin, against selected gram-positive pathogens, including enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus  epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pyogenes. the study pathogens were obtained from 2 sources: (1) clinical isolates taken from patients participating in q/d worldwide phase iii comparative and noncomparative (emergency-use program) clinical trials; and (2) other isolates collected from the laboratories of 45 geographically distinct medical centers around the world. q/d was highly active, with minimum inhibitory  concentrations (mics) < or = 1.0 microg/ml against most isolates, including those known to be resistant to methicillin, vancomycin, or erythromycin. q/d was active (mics < or = 1 microg/ml) against 95% of the vancomycin-resistant e. faecium strains, for example, whereas ciprofloxacin was active against 6%. q/d was equally active against methicillin-susceptible or -resistant s. aureus strains (mic90=1 microg/ml), as was vancomycin (mic90=2 microg/ml), whereas ciprofloxacin was much less active against methicillin-resistant strains than against methicillin-susceptible strains (mic90=32 vs 1 microg/ml). given its spectrum of  activity, q/d may provide a viable option for the treatment of severe respiratory and skin and skin-structure infections caused by gram-positive bacteria, especially when strains with known or suspected resistance to other commonly used antibiotics are present.

TI  == favorable prognosis of purulent meningitis in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus.
AB  == we prospectively reviewed all cases of purulent meningitis among human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) type 1-infected patients > 14 years old that occurred at the hospital general vall d'hebron (barcelona) during the period 1 january 1985 through 31 march 1997. there were 12 episodes of purulent meningitis in nine of 2,150 hiv-1-infected patients. the annual rate of purulent meningitis  was 0.465 cases per 1,000 patients, a rate that is 150 times higher than that for the general population. during 10 episodes, cd4+ lymphocyte counts were < 200/mm3. the etiologic organism was streptococcus pneumoniae in nine episodes (seven episodes occurred in four splenectomized patients), and escherichia coli,  streptococcus agalactiae, and enterococcus faecium each caused one episode. clinical features and cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities were similar to those observed among patients without hiv-1 infection. all patients had bacteremia. the overall mortality was 8.3%. we conclude that purulent meningitis, particularly pneumococcal meningitis, is more frequent among hiv-1-infected patients than in the general population. the prognosis for hiv-1-infected patients is better than  for hiv-1-negative patients.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of quinupristin-dalfopristin (rp 59500, synercid) tested against over 28,000 recent clinical isolates from 200 medical centers in the united states and canada.
AB  == a total of 200 medical center laboratories in the usa and canada contributed results of testing quinupristin-dalfopristin, a streptogramin combination (formerly rp 59500 or synercid), against 28,029 gram-positive cocci. standardized tests [disk diffusion, broth microdilution, etest (ab biodisk, solna, sweden)] were utilized and validated by concurrent quality control tests. remarkable agreement was obtained between test method results for characterizing the collection by the important emerging resistances: 1) oxacillin resistance among staphylococcus aureus (41.0 to 43.7%); 2) vancomycin resistance among enterococcus faecium (50.0 to 52.0%); and 3) the penicillin nonsusceptible rate for pneumococci (31.1% overall, with 10.6% at mics of > or = 2 micrograms/ml). the quinupristin-dalfopristin mic90 for oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant s. aureus was 0.5 microgram/ml and 1 microgram/ml, respectively. the quinupristin-dalfopristin mic90 for vancomycin-resistant e. faecium was 1 microgram/ml, and only 0.2% of isolates were resistant. other enterococcus species were generally not susceptible to the streptogramin combination but were  usually inhibited by ampicillin (86 to 97% susceptible; mic50, 1.0 microgram/ml)  or vancomycin (86 to 95%; mic50, 1.0 microgram/ml). among all tested enterococci, the rate of vancomycin resistance was 16.2%. the quinupristin-dalfopristin mic90  (0.75 microgram/ml) for 4,626 tested streptococcus pneumoniae strains was not influenced by the penicillin or macrolide susceptibility patterns. when five regions in the usa and canada were analyzed for significant streptogramin and other antimicrobial spectrum differences, only the farwest region had lower numbers of streptogramin-susceptible e. faecium. canadian strains were generally  more susceptible to all drugs except chloramphenicol and doxycycline when tested  against e. faecalis (73% and 89% susceptible, respectively). the u.s. southeast region had s. pneumoniae strains less susceptible to macrolides (73%) but had more susceptibility among e. faecium isolates tested against vancomycin and ampicillin. the northeast region of the usa had the greatest rate of vancomycin resistance among enterococci. strains retested by the monitor because of quinupristin-dalfopristin resistance (mics, > or = 4 micrograms/ml) were generally not confirmed (2.2% validation), and only 0.2% of e. faecium isolates were identified as truly resistant. the most common errors were: 1) species misidentification (28.0%); 2) incorrect susceptibility results (65.6%); and 3) mixed cultures (4.3%) tested by participants. overall, quinupristin-dalfopristin  was consistently active (> or = 90% susceptible) against major gram-positive pathogens in north america, regardless of resistance patterns to other drug classes and geographic location of their isolation.

TI  == resistant penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  == low-affinity penicillin-binding proteins (pbps), which participate in the beta-lactam resistance of several pathogenic bacteria, have different origins. natural transformation and recombination events with dna acquired from neighbouring intrinsically resistant organisms are responsible for the appearance of mosaic genes encoding two or three low-affinity pbps in highly resistant strains of transformable microorganisms such as neisseria and streptococcus pneumoniae. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcal strains possess the meca determinant gene, which probably evolved  within the staphylococcus genus from a closely related and physiologically functional gene that was modified by point mutations. the expression of meca is either inducible or constitutive. a stable high-level resistant phenotype requires the synthesis of a normally constituted peptidoglycan. enterococci have  a natural low susceptibility to beta-lactams related to the presence of an intrinsic low-affinity pbp. highly resistant enterococcal strains overexpress this pbp and/or reduce its affinity.

AB  == the in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against 721 gram-negative and 498 gram-positive organisms was determined by the standard microdilution broth method using commercially prepared frozen microtiter plates. the activity of trovafloxacin was compared to ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanate,  ampicillin/sulbactam (1:1), piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftriaxone, and imipenem. trovafloxacin had equal or greater activity compared with the other agents tested against citrobacter diversus, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, serratia  marcescens, staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus viridans, group g streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, and e. faecium. the reliability of the commercially prepared plates for testing the in vitro activity of the quinolones was evaluated by comparing identical isolates also tested by broth microdilution using laboratory prepared plates. the commercially prepared plates generally correlated, within one- to twofold dilutions, with the laboratory prepared plates. there was, however, a large discrepancy obtained when testing enterobacter agglomerans and e. cloacae, where  the commercially prepared plates yielded a significantly higher mic90 value.

TI  == antibacterial efficacy of nisin against multidrug-resistant gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == the rapid spread of multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens necessitates the search for alternative antibacterial agents. we examined the efficacy of the antibiotic nisin against 56 multidrug-resistant isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae, 33 staphylococcus aureus and 29 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis isolates. the test strains represented a large  variety of clonal types (as determined by a combination of dna fingerprints) isolated from a variety of geographic sources, and included some of the major internationally-spread multiresistant epidemic clones of s. pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), mrsa strains resistant to over 16 generically distinct antibacterial agents, and enterococcal strains resistant to  all currently available chemotherapeutic agents including glycopeptides. in the overwhelming majority of cases, treatment of growing cultures with nisin at 1 mg/l (s. pneumoniae) or 10-20 mg/l (in mrsa and enterococci) caused extensive (10(3)- to 10(4)-fold) loss of viable titre accompanied by various degrees of loss in the optical density of the cultures, which was most extensive in pneumococci (>90%) and least extensive (40-50%) in enterococci. nevertheless, extensive variation in rates of nisin-induced autolysis was observed in each bacterial species. serial exposure of a penicillin-susceptible strain of s. pneumoniae to nisin (1 mg/l) in liquid culture resulted in the rapid appearance of stable nisin-resistant mutants in which the mic increased from 0.4 to 6.4 mg/l and the resistance trait was transferable by genetic transformation.

TI  == evaluation of an avian-specific probiotic to reduce the colonization and shedding of campylobacter jejuni in broilers.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni has often been responsible for human gastroenteritis. poultry have often been implicated as a source for these human infections. intestinal colonization of c. jejuni in the chicken plays a role in carcass contamination during slaughter. thus, reducing c. jejuni colonization in chickens can potentially reduce the incidence of c. jejuni infections in humans. the use of probiotics to competitively exclude the colonization of intestinal pathogens has been proposed for poultry. hence, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of an avian-specific probiotic containing lactobacillus acidophilus and streptococcus faecium for reducing the shedding and colonization of c. jejuni in  the chicken intestinal tract. day-old chicks were randomly allocated into either  a probiotic-treated group or a control group. the treated group was given probiotic from day 1 to day 3, and the control group was not given any probiotic. six hours after the first oral administration of probiotics (treatment) or double distilled water (control), these chicks were challenged with c. jejuni. the frequency of the c. jejuni shedding was monitored until market age. intestinal colonization was determined for the two experimental groups at slaughter. results indicated that chickens given probiotics from day 1 to day 3 had a 70% reduction  in the frequency of c. jejuni shedding in colonized chicks (p = 0.0001) and a 27% reduction in jejunal colonization in colonized chicks (p = 0.0001) at slaughter when compared with the control group. thus, the use of the avian-specific probiotic containing l. acidophilus and s. faecium can reduce the colonization and frequency of fecal shedding of c. jejuni in market-aged broilers.

AB  == rp 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin) is the first semisynthetic injectable streptogramin antimicrobial agent, which is a combination of quinupristin and dalfopristin in a 30:70 ratio. the components of rp 59,500 act synergically to provide bactericidal activity through action at different sites on bacterial ribosomes. in the present study, the antimicrobial activity of rp 59,500 was compared with those of four macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, roxithromycin). susceptibility testing was carried out by microdilution method on 303 strains of 10 species, especially antibiotic-resistant gram-positive cocci. rp 59,500 was active against a wide range of gram-positive cocci including methicillin-resistant staphylococci and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the mics90 of rp 59,500 against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis were both 0.25 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. the mics90 of rp 59,500 against penicillin-sensitive, -intermediate and -resistant s. pneumoniae were all 0.5 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. rp 59,500 also exhibited equivalent activities to the four macrolides against strains of streptococcus pyogenes. streptococcus agalactiae and moraxella catarrhalis. rp 59,500 exhibited the highest activities against enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus avium strains which  are intrinsically resistant to most antimicrobial agents. no cross-resistance was observed between rp 59,500 and the four macrolides, which will merit attention in future clinical trials of the agent. the effect of human serum on the mic of rp 59,500 was studied with strains of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and e. faecalis. the presence of 20% (v/v) serum had little or no effect on the mic, although 50% (v/v) serum increased mics by 4-8 folds. laboratory-induced resistance to rp 59,500 occurred in a stepwise fashion in broth cultures of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and e. facalis strains and the induction rate was slow and no more than four fold increases were observed. population analysis was performed on rp 59,500 and the reference macrolides against s. aureus atcc 25,923 strain. although low frequencies (less than 0.01%) of resistant sub-population were detected with em, cam, azm and rxm, no rp 59,500-resistant sub-population was detected in this study.

TI  == [the role of carbapenems in the treatment of nosocomial infection].
AB  == carbapenems are active beta-lactam antibiotics versus most of the gram positive and gram negative microorganisms and anaerobes although their activity is lacking in the case of staphylococcus sp. resistant to methicillin, enterococcus faecium  and streptococcus pneumoniae with high resistance to penicillin and some gram negative bacilli which naturally produce an methaloenzyme able to hydrolyze them  such as stenotrophomonas maltophilia. imipenem, the first synthetized carbapenem  requires administration with cilastatin to avoid inactivation by renal dehydropeptidase 1. meropenem does not require being taken with the renal enzyme  inhibitor, with its activity being similar to that of imipenem. in abdominal infection the carbapenems have shown to be the authentic monotherapy in this type of infections being as effective as the different schedules of antibiotic associations normally used. treatment with carbapenems in bacterial meningitis should be currently limited to the cases produced by gram negative bacilli producers of wide spectrum beta-lactamases (wsbl), cases of meningitis by pseudomonas aeruginosa or gram negative bacilli producers of inducible cephalosporinase. meropenem is the carbapenem of choice probably in these cases because the carbapenems are often the only active antibiotics and meropenem, specifically, does not have the risk of convulsions observed with imipenem-cilastatin. the carbapenems have shown to be useful in skin and soft tissue infections as well as in obstetric and gynecologic infections as monotherapy similar to the schedules of the currently used antibiotic associations. in the case of nosocomial pneumonias, all the studies have evaluated the carbapenems in monotherapy as useful and effective, specially in the case of pneumonia by gram negative bacilli. finally, in non filiated nosocomial sepsis and specially in the case of neutropenic patients, the use of carbapenems is particularly attractive in gram negative sepsis in intensive care  units. the appearance in the last few years of strains of gram negative bacilli,  producers of wide spectrum beta-lactamase or stable repressed hyperproducers of class i chromosomic cephalosporinase, as well as other multiresistant gram negative bacilli, such as acinetobacter baumanii make the carbapenems, in many cases, the only effective antibiotic in this type of infections.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

TI  == successful single-dose teicoplanin prophylaxis against experimental streptococcal, enterococcal, and staphylococcal aortic valve endocarditis.
AB  == teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that is administered both intramuscularly and intravenously. it has a prolonged half-life and a less toxic  profile in comparison to those of vancomycin. the efficacy of a single dose of teicoplanin (18 mg/kg of body weight given intramuscularly) for the prevention of endocarditis due to streptococcus oralis, enterococcus faecium, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was evaluated after applying the rabbit model. vancomycin at a single dose of 30 mg/kg given intravenously was used as the comparative agent for the prevention of endocarditis due to mrsa and  e. faecium, while ampicillin at a single dose of 40 mg/kg given intravenously was used as the comparative agent for the prevention of endocarditis due to s. oralis. rabbits in the teicoplanin group were infected at 1 h postdosing with approximately 10(7) cfu of each strain. rabbits in the other groups were infected at 0.5 h postdosing with approximately 10(7) cfu of s. oralis (ampicillin group)  or e. faecium and mrsa (vancomycin group). all rabbits were sacrificed 5 days later. teicoplanin and vancomycin protected the animals challenged with e. faecium by 87.5 and 50%, respectively, and protected the animals challenged with  mrsa by 100 and 92%, respectively. teicoplanin and ampicillin protected the animals challenged with s. oralis by 100 and 77%, respectively. prevention of endocarditis by teicoplanin was likely to be due to a prolonged inhibition of bacterial growth by the sustained supra-mics. it is concluded that teicoplanin is very effective in preventing experimental streptococcal, enterococcal, and staphylococcal endocarditis and may be an attractive alternative antibiotic in patients allergic to beta-lactams, especially in the outpatient setting.

AB  == rpr 106972 is a novel oral streptogramin combination with reported therapeutic potency against gram-positive and certain respiratory tract pathogens. mics for rpr 106972, quinupristin/dalfopristin, and seven comparison drugs were determined by the reference methods against 337 strains selected to define spectrum and potency. rpr 106972 demonstrated antimicrobial activity against oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus (mic ranges of 0.12 to 2 micrograms/ml and 0.5 to 2 micrograms/ml, respectively), and coagulase-negative staphylococci were also inhibited by rpr 106972 (mic90, < or = 0.5 microgram/ml)  and quinupristin/dalfopristin (mic90, < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). against all streptococcal strains tested (including penicillin-resistant pneumococcus), rpr 106972 was highly active with mic results at < or = 1 microgram/ml. rpr 106972 inhibited corynebacterium jeikeium (mic90, 0.5 microgram/ml). moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 0.25 microgram/ml), and some haemophilus influenzae (mic50, 2 micrograms/ml). rpr 106972 and quinupristin/dalfopristin demonstrated little activity against enterococcus faecalis (mic90s, 4 to 32 micrograms/ml) as compared to enterococcus faecium (mic90s, 0.5 to 1 microgram/ml) and other enterococcus ssp. (mic90s, 1 microgram/ml). studies to establish mic quality-control guidelines indicated the following ranges: for e. faecalis atcc 29212, 0.5 to 4 micrograms/ml; for s. aureus atcc 29213, 0.25 to 1 microgram/ml;  and for streptococcus pneumoniae atcc 49619, 0.06 to 0.5 microgram/ml. the results of this study indicate that the in vitro activity of rpr 106972 against gram-positive bacteria and selected gram-negative respiratory organisms is promising and warrants additional studies of pharmacokinetics, and in vivo infection model dynamics.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of ru-59863, a c-7 catechol substituted cephalosporin.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ru-59863, a so-called "fifth generation" catechol cephalosporin, was evaluated against 606 bacterial isolates and compared with the activities of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, and cefpirome. ru-59863 demonstrated a broad spectrum of inhibition and superior overall activity than comparators when tested against enterobacteriaciae (mic90s, 0.015 to 2 micrograms/ml), pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 0.5 microgram/ml), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic90, 0.25 microgram/ml), acinetobacter ssp. (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus ssp. (mic90s,  0.5 to 8 micrograms/ml). potent ru-59863 activity was also observed against beta-haemolytic and viridans gr. streptococci (mic90s, 0.12-0.5 microgram/ml), streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90s, 0.03 to 0.5 microgram/ml), haemophilus influenzae (mic90, 0.06 microgram/ml), and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mic90, 0.06 micrograms/ml). ru-59863 demonstrated marginal potency against enterococcus faecalis (mics 2 to 16 micrograms/ml) and was inactive against enterococcus faecium (mic90, > 128 micrograms/ml). oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were not  inhibited by ru-59863 (mic90s, 32 to 128 micrograms/ml). among the cephalosporins tested, ru-59863 performed best versus ceftazidime-resistant bush group 1 isolates and strains producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases. ru-59863 was also effective against many fluoroquinolone-, aminoglycoside-, and imipenem-resistant isolates. ru-59863 seems to be a significant advance in cephalosporin chemistry and activity, especially against gram-negative pathogens  resistant to current beta-lactam therapeutic agents. further studies of human pharmacokinetics and against clinical infections are encouraged.

AB  == the in-vitro activity of trovafloxacin, a new quinolone, was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, various beta-lactam antibiotics and, where appropriate, clindamycin and vancomycin against a range of gram-positive bacteria including staphylococci (n = 201), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 83), beta-haemolytic streptococci (n = 46), viridans group streptococci (n = 100), streptococcus milleri (n = 18) and enterococci (n = 161) by an agar dilution technique. in addition, time-kill studies were performed to estimate the bactericidal activity of trovafloxacin against s. milleri and viridans group streptococci. trovafloxacin was the most active agent tested against staphylococci. it also showed good activity, at least four-fold and usually eight- to 16-fold that of ciprofloxacin, against all the streptococci. trovafloxacin showed good activity against vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, but was less active against the 11 isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci. trovafloxacin showed comparable or superior bactericidal activity to amoxycillin against the s. milleri and viridans group streptococci tested.

TI  == detection of the phosphorylcholine epitope in streptococci, haemophilus and pathogenic neisseriae by immunoblotting.
AB  == the phosphorylcholine (pc) determinant in streptococcus pneumoniae is known to be linked to the cell wall polysaccharides (c-ps) and to the lipoteichoic acid (lta) (forssman antigen) of the plasma membrane. western blotting with two pc specific  murine monoclonal antibodies (mabs) designated 145,f-2 (igm) and 147,a-1 (iga) showed a similar ladder-like pattern for all examined strains of s. pneumoniae and streptococcus mitis. purified antigens run in parallel indicated that this ladder pattern is due to the pc of lta. unlike other techniques, western blotting thus enables the identification of only one of the streptococcal structures carrying the pc epitope. gram-negative organisms were also examined, and six of 11 haemophilus influenzae strains reacted with the mabs. for this species, unlike the streptococci, only one fast moving band was detected. analyses by thin-layer  chromatography (tlc) detected the pc epitope in lipopolysaccharide (lps) fraction from h. influenzae. some strains of the neisseriaceae family were also positive by western blotting, but tlc and immunostaining did not detect the pc determinant in lps.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activity of du-6681a, a parent compound of dz-2640, against gram-positive and -negative bacteria was compared with those of penems and cephalosporins currently available. mics at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (mic90s) of the compound for clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains, were 0.10, 25, and 12.5 microg/ml, respectively. du-6681a inhibited the growth of all strains of streptococcus pyogenes and of penicillin-susceptible and -insusceptible streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.006, 0.025, and 0.20 microg/ml, respectively, and mic90s of the compound were 6.25 and >100 microg/ml for enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, respectively. mic90s of du-6681a  were 0.20, 0.10, and 0.025 microg/ml for haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, respectively. for pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mic50 and mic90 of du-6681a were 25 and 50 microg/ml, respectively. du-6681a  activity was not affected by different media, varied inoculum size (10(4) to 10(7) cfu), or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions against gram-negative bacteria, under alkaline conditions against gram-positive bacteria, and in human urine, as was the activity of the other antibiotics tested. the frequency of spontaneous resistance to du-6681a was less  than or equal to those of the reference compounds. time-kill curve studies demonstrated the bactericidal action of du-6681a against s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and h. influenzae.

TI  == activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against gram-positive bacteria: clinical applications and therapeutic potential.
AB  == in recent years there has been a dramatic worldwide increase in the prevalence of multiple drug-resistant strains of common gram-positive bacteria. this highlights the need for a new class of antibiotic with activity against these organisms. quinupristin/dalfopristin, the first injectable streptogramin antibiotic, has a unique spectrum of activity, encompassing most gram-positive cocci (including multi-drug-resistant strains), respiratory pathogens and anaerobes, gram-positive, and a prolonged post-antibiotic effect. quinupristin/ dalfopristin is active in vitro against multi-drug-resistant isolates of staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, penicillin-resistant pneumococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium. clinical case reports have shown that  the combination is active against intra-abdominal, aortic graft, bacteraemia and  hydrocephalus shunt infections caused by multi-drug-resistant enterococci, particularly e. faecium. in almost all of these clinical situations the enterococcal infection had displayed resistance to all other antimicrobial therapies. preliminary clinical data have demonstrated the activity of quinupristin/ dalfopristin against s. aureus bacteraemia, and quinupristin/dalfopristin may also prove useful in the treatment of pneumococcal  infections. thus, possible future applications of the combination include the treatment of multi-drug-resistant strains of staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci. quinupristin/dalfopristin may prove useful in the treatment of staphylococcal infections in children, invasive systemic pneumococcal infections, and nosocomial and community-acquired gram-positive infections in patients unable to tolerate beta-lactam antimicrobial agents or glycopeptide antibiotics.

TI  == development of provisional disc diffusion breakpoints for testing quinupristin/dalfopristin.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin is an injectable streptogramin with broad activity against many gram-positive bacteria, including streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium. although a number of studies have reported the mics of this compound against a variety of bacteria, there are no published reports of disc diffusion testing. we tested total disc masses of 7.5 and 15 micrograms with varying ratios of the component compounds, quinupristin and dalfopristin, combined in the following quinupristin: dalfopristin ratios (in microgram): 7.5:0, 0:7.5, 10:5, 5:10, 5:2.5 and 2.5:5. zone diameters and mics were determined in parallel for 44 isolates of staphylococci, 47 isolates pneumococci and 64 isolates of enterococci. control strains were included for each species tested, including a strain of enterococcus faecalis with known resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin. using tentative definitions for quinupristin/dalfopristin of < or = 2 mg/l as susceptible and > or = 4 mg/l as resistant, each of the four discs containing ratios of both component compounds separated presumptive susceptible organisms from resistant ones better than either quinupristin or dalfopristin alone. the best correlation of zone sizes and mics for predicting susceptibility to quinupristin/dalfopristin at an mic of < or = 2 mg/l was achieved with the 5 micrograms:10 micrograms disc and a zone diameter of > or = 18 mm. these criteria may be useful for identifying organisms  that are presumptively susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin.

TI  == in-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new water-soluble streptogramin antimicrobial agent comprising quinupristin and dalfopristin in a ratio of 30:70. the in-vitro  spectrum of activity includes most multi-resistant gram-positive aerobes, important gram-negative aerobes, gram-positive anaerobes and intracellular bacteria that are causal agents of respiratory, blood and cutaneous infections. of particular note, quinupristin/dalfopristin is active against multidrug-resistant isolates of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecium, and against penicillin-resistant and/or erythromycin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the combination is also active against staphylococci showing both constitutive and inducible erythromycin resistance. bactericidal activity and a prolonged post-antibiotic effect have also been noted for quinupristin/dalfopristin against gram-positive cocci. gram-negative bacteria susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin include moraxella catarrhalis, legionella spp. and mycoplasma spp. overall, the spectrum of antibacterial activity indicates a potential role for this combination in the treatment of difficult-to-treat gram-positive infections, including those caused  by multidrug-resistant organisms. since this activity extends to gram-negative respiratory bacteria, quinupristin/dalfopristin may also find a role in the treatment of atypical, as well as typical, pneumonia.

TI  == pharmaceutical probiotics for the treatment of anaerobic and other infections.
AB  == pharmaceutical probiotics have been used as alternative treatments or preventative therapies for a variety of clinical diseases. the overuse of antibiotics and emergence of multiple-antibiotic resistant pathogens has refocused clinical attention on the field of probiotics. anaerobic infections which seem to respond well to probiotics are infections which involve the disruption of normal microbial flora. gastrointestinal infections (travelers' diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea,clostridium difficile disease, rotavirus diarrhea) have been studied using the following pharmaceutical probiotics:saccharomyces boulardii, lactobacillus casei gg, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, bifidobacterium bifidum, streptococcus thermophilus and enterococcus faecium. vaginitis has been experimentally studied  using l. acidophilus and l. casei gg. the efficacy, safety and mechanisms of action of these various probiotics are reviewed. requirements for drug approval are similar for biologic probiotics and new drug entities and these requirements  involve preclinical tolerability studies, pharmacokinetic studies and large, well-controlled blinded clinical trials.

TI  == antimicrobial characteristics of quinupristin/dalfopristin (synercid at 30:70 ratio) compared to alternative ratios for in vitro testing.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new streptogramin combination that occurs at a natural ratio and formulation of 30:70. rapid metabolism of the dalfopristin component to rp 12536 in vivo puts in question the validity of in vitro test of spectrum with the parent combination. in studies of quinupristin with both dalfopristin and rp 12536, a wide range of ratios (30:70, 50:50, 70:30) were tested by reference mic and mbc tests. no significant potency differences were observed between combination ratios or metabolic components when testing 256 bacterial strains. quinupristin/dalfopristin or quinupristin/rp 12536 remained active, by bactericidal action against many staphylococci and streptococcus ssp.  enterococcus faecium strains were susceptible (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml; static effect only) to the streptogramin, but e. faecalis, pasteurella multocida, pediococcus ssp., haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis were generally less susceptible (mic90, > or = 8 micrograms/ml). the log phase inoculum was preferred for mbc and kill-curve tests with this combination. the 30:70 ratio in  vitro susceptibility test of quinupristin/dalfopristin as used to date, seems to  predict the potency and spectrum of this streptogramin accurately and all clinically important in vivo ratios of the injectable form or its major metabolites. quinupristin/dalfopristin should be further investigated for clinical use against emerging resistant gram-positive infections, especially penicillin-resistant streptococci and glycopeptide-resistant e. faecium that exhibit susceptibility in this investigation.

AB  == ketolides, a novel macrolide subclass, possess a mode of action that is similar to that of structurally related macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (mls) compounds. by using reference in vitro tests, the in vitro activity of ru-64004 was compared to those of six other mls compounds against more than 800 clinical pathogens, including 356 gram-positive organisms. the spectrum of activity of the ketolide was most similar to that of clindamycin versus staphylococci and streptococci and superior to those of all macrolides tested against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant (vana, vanb, and vanc) enterococcal isolates. the activity of the ketolide was greater than those of the macrolides, azalides, or clindamycin tested against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (mics at which 90% of isolates are inhibited [mic90s], 0.25 to 4 micrograms/ml), penicillin-resistant pneumococci (mic90, 0.25 micrograms/ml), and most beta-hemolytic streptococci. all streptococcus pneumoniae and beta-hemolytic streptococcus strain were inhibited by ketolide concentrations of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. against 165 erythromycin-resistant strains, ru-64004 inhibited (mics, < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml) approximately one-third of staphylococci, all streptococci, and slightly more than one-half of the enterococci. quinupristin-dalfopristin (a streptogramin combination) was active against all tested isolates with the exception of non-enterococcus faecium enterococci, against which the ketolide exhibited greater potency (mic50s, 0.03 to 2 micrograms/ml). the ketolide was also active against haemophilus influenzae (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 0.12 micrograms/ml), pathogenic neisseria spp. (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), and many gram-positive anaerobes (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). ru-64004 may enhance the role of macrolide  drugs in the treatment of some serious infections caused by mls-resistant gram-positive organisms.

TI  == multidrug-resistant gram-positive pathogens. an update on current microbiological patterns.
AB  == although resistance has developed among gram-positive pathogens to penicillins, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, quinolones and macrolides, the glycopeptides seem to remain largely unaffected. however, the recent emergence and range of glycopeptide resistance in enterococci, well documented in the usa but not in the rest of the world, have prompted this european surveillance study. the european glycopeptide resistance survey was undertaken in 1995 in 9 countries and involved 70 microbiological centres. the primary aims of the survey were as follows: (i) to perform a microbiological quality assurance assessment to evaluate the ability of participating laboratories to correctly identify the strains and assess their  glycopeptide susceptibility; and (ii) to accurately determine the level of glycopeptide resistance among staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci in european hospitals. the in vitro activity of several other antibiotics was assessed on strains isolated from the italian centres. in total, 7078 gram-positive isolates were collected in europe, and national coordinators used the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) agar dilution reference method to successfully retest 96% of these. according to mode minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), teicoplanin activity was similar to that of vancomycin against staphylococcus aureus. in general, the range of mics for teicoplanin was wider than that for vancomycin against coagulase-negative staphylococci. against enterococcus spp. and streptococcus spp., teicoplanin was  4 times more active than vancomycin. the greatest number of glycopeptide refractory organisms was evident among enterococci; resistance was observed to be approximately 10 times more frequent in enterococcus faecium than in e. faecalis. the results from the italian isolates were similar to those from the overall study. in particular, teicoplanin was 2- to 8-fold more active than vancomycin against the majority of the enterococci. the incidence of enterococcal resistance was lower in italy (0.6% for teicoplanin and 0.9% for vancomycin) than in europe  (1.7% for teicoplanin and 2.3% for vancomycin). this extensive survey confirms that teicoplanin is more active than vancomycin against enterococci and streptococci, and that both display similar potency against staphylococci.

TI  == glucose starvation response in enterococcus faecalis jh2-2: survival and protein  analysis.
AB  == we investigated the survival of enterococcus faecalis following starvation provoked by energy source glucose exhaustion. inhibition of protein synthesis by  chloramphenicol before 3 h of starvation resulted in a dramatic decrease in viable bacteria. antibiotic treatment of cells after 3 or 6 h of starvation had a progressively lesser influence on bacterial survival. during the first 24 h of deprivation, a total of 42 proteins were identified as glucose-starvation-inducible; 4 temporal classes of proteins (a, b, c and d) were defined in relation to their enhanced synthesis after glucose exhaustion. our results show that proteins from the two early classes (a and b) seem to be the most important for long-term survival in e. faecalis. one protein of each of these classes was analysed at the molecular level. the n-terminal sequence of one of them, belonging to class a, showed strong homology with the n-terminal sequence of carbamate kinase from streptococcus faecium. this enzyme could be implicated in the development of alternative metabolic pathways of energy production and could be compared to the cst proteins of escherichia coli.

TI  == approaches to limiting emergence of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria in human populations.
AB  == infectious diseases continue to be major threats to human health around the world. within the past few years, several divergent groups of organisms have emerged as significant causes of morbidity and mortality. included among these are bacteria that are refractory to therapy because of the development of resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents. multidrug resistance in strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis, streptococcus pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, salmonella typhi, and enterococcus faecium has been reported. surveillance of resistant microorganisms in the united states and abroad is fragmentary and targets relatively few organisms. surveillance is further hampered by the fact that detection of some novel resistance mechanisms is difficult by means of current laboratory methods. both clinicians and public health officials are likely to continue to face a variety of challenges regarding surveillance, treatment, prevention, and control of drug-resistant infections.

AB  == streptococcus bovis nem760 was isolated from a stool swab collected on admission  from a patient as surveillance for vancomycin-resistant enterococci. strain nem760 was identified as s. bovis by conventional biochemical methods and partial sequence analysis of its 16s rrna. this strain was resistant to a low level of vancomycin (mic, 64 micrograms/ml) but was susceptible to teicoplanin (mic, 1 micrograms/ml), and vancomycin induced resistance to both glycopeptides. the presence of a vanb-related gene in nem760 was demonstrated in a pcr assay which enabled specific amplification of a 635-hp internal segment of vanb. sequence analysis of the corresponding pcr product revealed that it was highly homologous  (96% identity) to the prototype vanb sequence of enterococcus faecalis v583. the  vanb resistance of determinant of s. bovis nem760 was transferred by conjugation  to e. faecalis and enterococcus faecium at a similar frequency of 2 x 10(-5) per  donor. smai-digested genomic dnas of independently obtained transconjugants of e. faecalis and e. faecium were analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and southern hybridization with a vanb dna probe. the electrophoretic and hybridization patterns obtained with all transconjugants of the same species were indistinguishable and revealed vanb-containing chromosomal insertions of approximately 100 kb. these results suggest that the genes mediating vanb-type resistance in s. bovis nem760 are part of large transferable genetic elements. the results presented in the report demonstrate for the first time the role of streptococci in the dissemination of vancomycin resistance among gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == long-term (6 months) effect of a new fermented milk product on the level of plasma lipoproteins--a placebo-controlled and double blind study.
AB  == objective: we have recently demonstrated a short-term hypocholesterolemic effect  (reduction of 8-10%) of a new fermented milk product taken for 6 weeks (agerbaek  et al, 1995; richelsen et al, 1993). the present study was undertaken to investigate the more long-term (6 months) effect of this fermented product on the level of lipoproteins. design: the study was randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled, and performed for a period of six months. subjects: eighty-seven non-obese and normocholesterolemic females and males, aged 50-70 y old, were included in the study. intervention: 200 ml of either the fermented milk product or placebo (chemically fermented) were given daily. the test product was fermented with a bacteria culture containing enterococcus faecium and two strains of streptococcus termophilus. results: after one month the total- and ldl-cholesterol were significantly reduced in the fermented milk group as compared to placebo, ldl was reduced by 0.21 mmol/l vs 0.0 mmol/1 (p < 0.02). the maximal reduction of ldl-cholesterol was reached after 3 months in the test group with a reduction of 0.32 mmol/1 of initial values (p < 0.001). in the placebo group a gradual fall of total- and ldl-cholesterol was observed from 1-6 months of the study. thus, after six months the reduction of ldl-cholesterol was similar in the two groups (p = 0.95) even though the reduction was significant in both groups in relation to initial values (p < 0.05). no changes in hdl-cholesterol or triglyceride were observed during the study. there were no differences in the response between women and men. conclusion: the fermented milk product resulted in a rapid reduction of ldl-cholesterol observed after one month but during long-term intake (6 months) the reduction of ldl-cholesterol was similar to the placebo product, indicating that low-fat milk or fermented milk products may have some hypocholesterolemic effects but the present tested product does not seem to  be superior in that respect to the placebo milk product used in the present study.

TI  == 2-amino-4-oxo-5-substituted-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines as nonclassical antifolate  inhibitors of thymidylate synthase.
AB  == six novel 2-amino-4-oxo-5-[(substituted phenyl)sulfanyl]pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines 7-12 were synthesized as potential inhibitors of thymidylate synthase (ts) and as antitumor and/or antibacterial agents. the analogues contain a 5-thio substituent with a phenyl, 4'-chlorophenyl, 3',4'-dichlorophenyl, 4'-nitrophenyl, 3',4'-dimethoxyphenyl, and 2'-naphthyl on the sulfur, and were synthesized from the key intermediate 2-(pivaloylamino)-4-oxo-6-methylpyrrolo[2,3-d]-pyrimidine, 17. appropriately substituted aryl thiols were appended to the 5-position of 17 via an oxidative addition reaction using iodine, ethanol, and water under conditions which also resulted in the deprotection of the 2-amino group. the compounds were evaluated against human, lactobacillus casei, escherichia coli, streptococcus faecium, and pneumocystis carinii (pc) tss and against human, rat liver (rl), pc, and toxoplasma gondii (tg) dhfrs. the nonclassical analogues with the 3',4'-dichloro and the 4'-nitro substituents in the side chain (9 and 10) were more potent than n-[4-[n-[(2-amino-3,4-dihydro-4-oxo-6-quinazolinyl)methyl]-n-prop- 2-ynylamino]benzoyl]-l-glutamic acid (pddf, 1) and n-[5-[n-[(3,4-dihydro-2-methyl-4-oxo-6-quinazolinyl)methyl]-n- methylamino]-2-thenoyl]-l-glutamic acid (zd1694,2) against human ts. analogues with the 4'-chloro, 3',4'-dimethoxy, and naphthyl side chains (8, 11 and 12) were more potent than the unsubstituted phenyl analogue (7) but less than 2, 9, and 10 by 1 order of magnitude. they were all poor inhibitors of human, rl, and pc dhfrs (ic50 = 10(-5) m) but moderate inhibitors (ic50 = 10(-6) m) of tg dhfr. the 4-nitro analogue, 10 (ec50 1.5 microm), was comparable to pddf in its potency as  an inhibitor of the growth of the fadu human squamous cell carcinoma cell line.

TI  == pseudo-outbreak of enterococcus durans infections and colonization associated with introduction of an automated identification system software update.
AB  == enterococci are an important cause of hospital-acquired infections. since 1989, there has been an increase in the number of nosocomial enterococcal infections caused by strains resistant to vancomycin in the united states. although many enterococcal species can colonize humans, only enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, e. raffinosus, and e. casseliflavus have been implicated in clusters of infection. in january 1996, the centers for disease control and prevention received a report of an outbreak of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in which 31  of 84 (36.9%) isolates were identified as e. durans. twenty-nine isolates identified as e. durans were identified to the species level after the introduction of an automated identification system software update (vitek gram-positive identification card, version r09.1) for the identification of species of gram-positive organisms. when seven isolates initially reported as e.  durans were identified to the species level by alternate methods, they were found to be e. faecium. subsequently, isolates identified as e. durans by the automated system were reidentified by using a rapid streptococcus test, and no further enterococcal isolate has been confirmed as e. durans. automated microbial analysis is a potential source of error that is not easily recognized. when laboratory findings are discordant with expected clinical or epidemiologic patterns, confirmatory testing by alternate methods should be performed.

TI  == semisynthetic glycopeptide antibiotics derived from ly264826 active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  == certain derivatives of the glycopeptide antibiotic ly264826 with n-alkyl-linked substitutions on the epivancosamine sugar are active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci. six compounds representing our most active series were evaluated for activity against antibiotic-resistant, gram-positive pathogens. for enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis resistant to both vancomycin  and teicoplanin, the mics of the six semisynthetic compounds for 90% of the strains tested were 1 to 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 2,048 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 256 micrograms/ml for ly264826. for e. faecium and e. faecalis resistant to vancomycin but not teicoplanin, the mics were 0.016 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 64 to 1,024 micrograms/ml for vancomycin. the compounds were highly active against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci and against e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus and showed some activity against isolates of highly vancomycin-resistant leuconostocs and pediococci. the mics for 90% of the strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus tested were typically 0.25 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 microgram/ml for vancomycin. against methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis mics ranged from 0.25 to 2 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 to 4 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 4 to 16 micrograms/ml for teicoplanin. the spectrum of these new compounds included activity against teicoplanin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci. the compounds exhibited exceptional potency against pathogenic streptococci, with mics of < or = 0.008 microgram/ml against streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant isolates. in in vivo studies with a mouse infection model, the median effective doses against a challenge by s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, or s. pyogenes were typically 4 to 20 times lower than those of vancomycin. overall, these new glycopeptides, such as ly307599 and ly333328, show promise for use as agents against resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci.

TI  == quinupristin-dalfopristin (rp 59500): an injectable streptogramin combination.
AB  == the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, activity, and potential clinical role of quinupristin-dalfopristin (rp 59500) are described. quinupristin-dalfopristin is  the first injectable formulation of the streptogramin antibiotics. streptogramin  drug products are each composed of two chemically distinct compounds, which when  administered together act synergistically by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. quinupristin-dalfopristin has shown activity in vitro against many strains of streptococci and staphylococci, including methicillin- and erythromycin-resistant strains of staphylococci. the combination is more active against enterococcus faecium than enterococcus faecalis. it has also shown activity in vitro against certain gram-negative organisms and anaerobes. the mean maximum blood concentration at the end of a one-hour infusion ranged from 0.95 mg/l for a 1.4-mg/kg dose to 24.2 mg/l for a 29.4-mg/kg dose; there was a linear  correlation between dose and mean area under the concentration-time curve. mean half-life ranged from 1.27 to 1.53 hours. the drug is under investigation in the  united states in phase iii trials. of 60 evaluable patients with documented bacteremia involving e. faecium resistant to vancomycin, 40 (67%) had a favorable clinical response. of 11 patients with bacteremia caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, 78% had a favorable response. the efficacy of quinupristin-dalfopristin in treating resistant infections has also been suggested by smaller studies and case reports. the drug may be useful in the prophylaxis of endocarditis. adverse reactions are generally mild and transient.  quinupristin-dalfopristin may be useful in treating serious gram-positive infections, but more clinical study is needed.

TI  == influence of lipoteichoic acid structure on recognition by the macrophage scavenger receptor.
AB  == lipoteichoic acids (ltas) belong to the immunostimulatory class of molecules of gram-positive bacteria (gpb). previous investigations showed that the macrophage  scavenger receptor (sr), a glycosylated trimeric transmembrane protein, binds directly to many gpb, possibly via lta. sr binding to other ligands is dependent  upon the spatial characteristics of the repeating negative charge of the ligand.  we therefore investigated sr recognition of lta species with various charge densities and distributions by determining the capacity of these ltas to compete  with the binding of metabolically labeled sr to beads coated with the known sr ligand polyguanylic acid. staphylococcus aureus lta, a classical lta type (unbranched 1,3-linked polyglycerophosphate chain covalently bound to a membrane  diacylglyceroglycolipid), had a 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50) for inhibition of sr binding of 0.84 microg/ml. when the s. aureus lta was rendered more negatively charged by removal of ester-linked alanine from the polyglycerophosphate backbone, the ic50 dropped to 0.23 microg/ml. other polyglycerophosphate ltas from enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae, listeria monocytogenes, listeria welshimeri, and streptococcus sanguis showed ic50s of 0.5 to 2.1 microg/ml, supporting the role of negative charge in binding to sr. accordingly, the zwitterionic lta of streptococcus pneumoniae and clostridium innocuum lta substituted with positively charged sugar residues had no binding capacity. monoglycerophosphate branches, but not succinyl ester, affected binding of lipoglycans. the data presented above parallel the previous findings for whole organisms and support the role of surface-associated lta as a major ligand of gpb for binding to sr. whether binding of lta and whole gpb to macrophages initiates uptake and degradation or results in signal transduction remains to be determined.

TI  == rapid identification of streptococcus and enterococcus species using diffuse reflectance-absorbance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and artificial neural networks.

AB  == the upjohn oxazolidinones, u-100592 and u-100766, are orally bioavailable synthetic antimicrobial agents with spectra of activity against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens. in several mouse models of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infection, u-100592 and u-100766 yielded oral 50% effective doses (ed50) ranging from 1.9 to 8.0 mg/kg of body weight, which compared favorably with vancomycin subcutaneous ed50 values of 1.1 to 4.4 mg/kg. similarly, both compounds were active versus a staphylococcus epidermidis experimental systemic infection. u-100592 and u-100766 effectively cured an enterococcus faecalis systemic infection, with ed50 values of 1.3 and 10.0 mg/kg, and versus a vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium infection in immunocompromised mice, both drugs effected cures at 12.5 and 24.0 mg/kg. both compounds were exceptionally active in vivo against penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, with ed50 values ranging from 1.2 to 11.7 mg/kg in systemic infection models. in soft tissue infection models with s. aureus and e. faecalis, both compounds exhibited acceptable curative activities in the range of 11.0 to 39.0 mg/kg. u-100766 was also very active versus the bacteroides fragilis soft tissue infection model (ed50 = 46.3 mg/kg).  in combination-therapy studies, both u-100592 and u-100766 were indifferent or additive in vivo against a monomicrobic s. aureus infection in combination with other antibiotics active against gram-positive bacteria and combined as readily as vancomycin with gentamicin in the treatment of a polymicrobic s. aureus-escherichia coli infection. u-100592 and u-100766 are potent oxazolidinones active against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens in experimental systemic and soft tissue infections.

TI  == in vitro activities of u-100592 and u-100766, novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agents.

AB  == objective: to evaluate the potential of biotherapeutic agents (microorganisms with therapeutic properties) for the prevention and/or treatment of selected intestinal and vaginal infections. data sources: the medline database was searched for all relevant articles published between 1966 and september 1995. search terms used were biotherapeutic agent, probiotic, lactobacillus, saccharomyces, bifidobacterium, candida, gastrointestinal- system, vaginitis, vaginosis-bacterial, and related terms. the bibliographies of obtained articles were also reviewed. study selection and data extraction: all placebo-controlled human studies on biotherapeutic agents were reviewed. english-language open trials, case series and reports, and animal studies were reviewed only if they were especially relevant to providing information on the potential efficacy, adverse effects, or mechanisms of action of these agents. data synthesis: placebo-controlled studies have shown that biotherapeutic agents have been used successfully to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea (lactobacillus caseigg, bifidobacterium longum, b longum with l acidophilus, and saccharomyces boulardii), to prevent acute infantile diarrhea (bifidobacterium bifidum with streptococcus thermophilus), to treat recurrent clostridium difficile disease (s  boulardii), and to treat various other diarrheal illnesses (enterococcus faecium  sf68, l caseigg, and s boulardii). there is also evidence for lactobacillus acidophilus in the prevention of candidal vaginitis. few adverse effects have been reported. however, many of the studies tested only small numbers of patients or volunteers. conclusions: there is now evidence that administration of selected microorganisms is beneficial in the prevention and treatment of certain intestinal and, possibly, treatment of vaginal infections. in an effort to decrease the reliance on antimicrobials, the time has come to carefully explore the therapeutic applications of biotherapeutic agents.

AB  == dramatic changes in the epidemiology and susceptibility patterns of gram-positive cocci during the last decade have mandated new approaches to the management of many bacterial infections. for example, there has been a sharp increase in the incidence of infections caused by staphylococcus aureus, particularly those resistant to methicillin (mrsa), and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, particularly those associated with foreign bodies and indwelling medical devices. additionally, the worldwide spread of streptococcus pneumoniae strains resistant to penicillin and macrolides, and the emergence of enterococci  (particularly enterococcus faecium) resistant to vancomycin, teicoplanin and other antibiotics, present further therapeutic problems. new antibacterial agents are urgently required to meet the challenges posed by these epidemiological trends. the semisynthetic streptogramins, a unique class of antibacterials currently under development, offer promise in the treatment of such multiresistant infections. possible future applications include treatment of infections caused by the following organisms: mrsa, enterococci resistant to vancomycin, macrolides or lincosamides; and beta-lactam-resistant streptococci. they may also prove useful as therapy for children with staphylococcal infection  and patients with multiresistant infections who are unable to tolerate vancomycin, including patients with skin and soft tissue infections caused by gram-positive pathogens, patients with osteomyelitis, foreign body associated infections, endocarditis and sepsis due to gram-positive bacteria. clinical trials are required to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of streptogramins in these settings.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == immunoblotting in the diagnosis of culture negative endocarditis caused by streptococci and enterococci.
AB  == aim: to improve the diagnosis of culture negative endocarditis by diagnosing cases due to streptococci and enterococci. methods: serum samples were immunoblotted against extracts of the commonest streptococci and enterococci. they were selected from patients with a cardiac murmur, persistent pyrexia and at least three negative blood cultures. the presence of patterns of endocarditis species specific antigenic bands was measured and correlated with clinical outcome. results: negative serology was found in 28 patients where the diagnosis  of endocarditis was rejected or, if proved, staphylococcal, yeast, gram negative, systemic lupus erythematosus, due to q fever or chlamydia psittaci or nonbacterial thrombotic. positive serology was found in 27 of the 34 patients where the response to antibiotics suggested streptococcal or enterococcal infection. in 22 of these there was objective evidence of endocarditis. positive  serology was also found in three of four further patients with vegetations at necropsy. conclusion: the identification of patterns of antibody response on immunoblotting can be used to make a specific diagnosis of streptococcal or enterococcal endocarditis in the absence of positive blood cultures.

TI  == development of rapd protocol for typing of strains of lactic acid bacteria and enterococci.
AB  == a protocol for typing strains of lactic acid bacteria and enterococci based on randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) fragments has been developed. using a single 10-mer primer, fingerprints were achieved without the need to isolate genomic dna. different conditions of dna release and amplification were investigated in order to obtain reproducible results and high discrimination among strains. this rapd protocol was successfully applied for the typing of strains belonging to the species lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. helveticus, lact. casei, lact. reuteri, lact. plantarum, enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium  and streptococcus thermophilus.

TI  == activities of the semisynthetic glycopeptide ly191145 against vancomycin-resistant enterococci and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == ly191145 is the prototype of a series of compounds with activities against vancomycin-resistant enterococci derived by modification of the glycopeptide antibiotic ly264826. ly191145 had mics for vancomycin- and teicoplanin-resistant  enterococci of < or = 4 micrograms/ml for 50% of isolates and < or = 16 micrograms/ml for 90% of isolates. its mics for vancomycin-resistant, teicoplanin-susceptible enterococci were 1 to 8 micrograms/ml. ly191145 retains the potent activities of its parent compound against staphylococci and streptococci. in vivo studies in a mouse infection model confirmed these activities. this compound indicates the potential of semisynthetic glycopeptides  as agents against antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of cs-940, a new trifluorinated quinolone.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of cs-940, a new trifluorinated quinolone drug, was tested against 761 clinical isolates. cs-940 activity against members of the family enterobacteriaceae was most similar to that of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, with a large range of mics inhibiting 90% of isolates tested (mic90s)  of 0.015 to 16 micrograms/ml (median mic90, 0.06 micrograms/ml). cs-940 had greater activity than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin when they were tested against acinetobacter spp. (mic90s, 0.03 micrograms/ml) and stenotrophomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia (mic90s, 2 micrograms/ml). cs-940 demonstrated a high degree of potency against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and neisseria spp. (mic90s, < or = 0.06 micrograms/ml). cs-940 was two- to eightfold  more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, and coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. cs-940 was also very active against streptococcus spp. and enterococci, for which mic90s were < or = 2 micrograms/ml; for enterococcus faecium, however, the mic90 was 4 micrograms/ml. cs-940 was generally less active than a comparison investigational fluoroquinolone, clinafloxacin. this compound appears promising by in vitro test analysis and warrants further in vivo trials.

TI  == antibacterial substance produced by streptococcus faecium under anaerobic culture.
AB  == a facultative anaerobe isolated from korean domestic soil produced an antibacterial substance under strict anaerobic conditions. based on the morphological and biochemical tests, and cellular fatty acid profiles, the anaerobe was identified as streptococcus faecium. an antimicrobial compound produced from the s. faecium was identified as 3,7,12-trihydroxy-24-cholanic acid methylester on the basis of its physico-chemical analysis. this substance had potent antibacterial activities against a test organism harboring multiple antibiotic resistance markers, and a variety of pathogenic bacteria. the isolated s. faecium produced lactic acid as well as the antibiotic compound under the anaerobic conditions.

TI  == characterization of superoxide dismutase genes from gram-positive bacteria by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers.
AB  == an internal fragment representing approximately 85% of sod genes from seven gram-positive bacteria was amplified by using degenerate primers in a polymerase  chain reaction assay. the dna sequences of sod polymerase chain reaction products from clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactococcus lactis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes were determined. comparisons of their deduced amino acid sequences with those of the corresponding regions of  the sod proteins from bacillus stearothermophilus, listeria monocytogenes, and streptococcus mutans revealed strong relatedness. phylogenetic analysis of sod peptides showed that members of the genera streptococcus and those of the genera  enterococcus constitute two well-supported monophyletic groups. the method described in this study provides a means for easy recovery of sod genes and the construction of sod mutants of various gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == meropenem: a microbiological overview.
AB  == meropenem is a parenteral carbapenem antibiotic which has excellent bactericidal  activity in vitro against almost all clinically significant aerobes and anaerobes. its high activity is explained by ease of entry into bacteria combined with good affinity for essential penicillin binding proteins, including those associated with cell lysis. breadth of spectrum is due, in part, to stability to  all serine-based beta-lactamases, including those which hydrolyse third-generation cephalosporins. meropenem has an antibacterial spectrum which is broadly similar to that of imipenem but, whilst slightly less active against staphylococci and enterococci, it is more active against pseudomonas aeruginosa,  all enterobacteriaceae and haemophilus influenzae. amongst common human pathogens, only methicillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococcus faecium are  uniformly resistant to meropenem. the meropenem mics for penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae are higher than for penicillin-susceptible strains but the organisms remain susceptible. clinical susceptibility in vitro to meropenem is defined by mics of < or = 4 mg/l, intermediate susceptibility by mics of 8 mg/l and mics of > or = 16 mg/l define resistance; equivalent figures for zones of growth inhibition are > or = 14 (susceptible), 12-13 (intermediate) and < or = 11 (resistant) mm. studies in guinea pig models of systemic infection and infections localised to the lungs, urinary tract and the central nervous system,  some of which used immunocompromised animals, confirm the potential of meropenem  demonstrated in vitro. these factors, combined with the human plasma, tissue or urinary concentrations of meropenem which exceed modal mics for the pathogens isolated in clinical trials for most or all of the recommended 8 h dosing interval, predict that meropenem should be efficacious in the treatment of infections at many body sites.

AB  == the survival of 8 bacterial species (pseudomonas sp., salmonella sp., enterobacteriae, streptococcus sp., escherichia coli) was detected in municipal sewage sludge up to 37 hours of mesophilic aerobic digestion under laboratory conditions. the model strain enterococcus faecium ccm 4231 survived almost twice  as long as the above-mentioned isolates. similar findings, regarding the viability of the microorganisms studied, were also determined during thermophilic aerobic digestion of municipal sewage sludges. the final reduction in the total count of bacteria was not directly dependent on the temperature during aerobic digestion. it may be supposed that e. faecium ccm 4231 strain as a bacteriocin-producing strain with a broad antimicrobial spectrum, inoculated into the sludges, could inhibit the growth of microorganisms in the sludges by the way of its bacteriocin activity. studying the effect of aerobic digestion on the viability of helminth eggs, the observed negative effect of higher temperatures was more expressive in comparison with bacterial strains. during thermophilic digestion process all helminth eggs (ascaris suum, toxocara canis) were devitalized. all eggs of t. canis were killed in experiments under mesophilic temperature. however, 32% of nonembryonated a. suum eggs remained viable.

TI  == antibiotic resistance.
AB  == antibiotics are commonly viewed as the most important advance in the history of medicine. during the six decades that followed the introduction of sulfonamides there has been a continuous supply of new agents responsive to evolving resistance of prior pathogens and emerging new pathogens. it now appears that the microbes confronting clinicians in the 1990s pose challenges that are unprecedented in the recent past. there are examples in virtually every category: malaria, multidrug-resistant mycobacterium tuberculosis, multiply resistant gram-negative bacilli, azole-resistant candida species, and metronidazole-resistant trichomonas. the two pathogens that are arguably the most important to otolaryngologists are vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and  penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the former is a nosocomially acquired pathogen that is especially prevalent in intensive care units and usually cannot be treated with antibiotics that have established merit. penicillin-resistant s pneumoniae is suddenly becoming a major problem in much of the world and its frequency in the united states is escalating at an alarming rate, especially in some geographic areas. this organism will require entirely new strategies for the empiric treatment of serious infections in which s pneumoniae is a documented or suspected pathogen. it is premature to say that traditional approaches to sinusitis and otitis need to be changed, but many suspect this will happen. one important lesson from this experience is that extensive antibiotic use and abuse has had some devastating consequences and many now believe that these are inevitable given current usage rates. the second lesson is that, although resistance seems predictable, specific patterns are not.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

(1). the main criteria used to distinguish between above species as well as their distribution on the five salami batches in relation to their succession with time and suitability as starters were discussed.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of sy5555, a new oral penem antibiotic.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of sy5555, a new oral penem antibiotic, was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram. sy5555 was more active than the comparison agents against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, morganella morganii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, clostridium spp., and bacteroides fragilis. against providencia spp., proteus spp., and haemophilus influenzae, sy5555 was less active than cefixime or cefteram. sy5555 was inactive against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. enterococcus faecium, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and xanthomonas maltophilia, as were the comparison agents. the bactericidal activities of sy5555, cefixime, and cefteram were at or slightly greater than the mics for clinical isolates of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. sy5555  was not hydrolyzed by various types of beta-lactamases. however, sy5555 and the comparison agents were hydrolyzed by x. maltophilia (l-1) and p. aeruginosa/pms354 beta-lactamases, two bush group 3 beta-lactamases, sy5555 showed a high affinity, as did cefixime and cefteram, for cephalosporinases from  c. freundii gn7391 and e. cloacae gn7471 strains. these results suggest that sy5555 may be more specific than existing beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == prevalence of important pathogens and antimicrobial activity of parenteral drugs  at numerous medical centers in the united states, i. study on the threat of emerging resistances: real or perceived? fluoroquinolone resistance surveillance  group.
AB  == forty-three medical centers participated in a national (united states) surveillance study of parenteral antimicrobial agents as empiric therapy of pathogens isolated from blood, skin wounds, respiratory tract, and urine (> 8500  strains, 200 per laboratory). all laboratories tested each organism by the same reagent disks and/or etest (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) strips. quality control results validated all laboratories for analyses. the most common isolates were escherichia coli (1648), staphylococcus aureus (1408), pseudomonas aeruginosa (1003), klebsiella species (792), and the enterococci (684). among the tested drugs the percent susceptible rates observed were ofloxacin (83.4%), ciprofloxacin (82.0%), and cefuroxime (62.9%) tested against all organisms; cefazolin (54.7%) and ceftazidime (76.7%) tested against all nonfastidious aerobes; gentamicin (91.2%), imipenem (95.3%), ticarcillin-clavulanate (78.2%), and ceftriaxone (66.2%) tested against gram-negative organisms only; and vancomycin (97.9%) and erythromycin (49.2%) tested against gram-positive aerobes. several drug-resistant species appear to be emerging or increasing in the united  states: (a) vancomycin-resistant enterococci (7.9%, mostly enterococcus faecium); (b) oxacillin-resistant s. aureus (21.0%); (c) third-generation cephalosporin-resistant enterobacteriaceae, including e. coli and klebsiella species with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (approximately 1.3%-8.6%); (d) penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (17.8%); and (e) ciprofloxacin-resistant p. aeruginosa (14.9%). fluoroquinolone resistance among the enteric bacilli was confirmed in 60 of 66 referred strains (0.8% of total strains), and cross-resistance was high among ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin, fleroxacin, and norfloxacin (98.3%-100%). seventeen strains of fluoroquinolone-resistant enteric bacilli (0.2% of total) also harbored an esbl and resistance to aminoglycosides. clonal spread within medical centers was observed with the esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae. this national clinical isolate data base continues to demonstrate broad fluoroquinolone efficacy (ofloxacin > ciprofloxacin) against hospital-based pathogens and many strains of  emerging resistant bacteria. continued us surveillance studies are urged to monitor emerging antimicrobial resistance and to guide interventions to minimize  its occurrence.

TI  == [method of dna extraction and meca, fema and pbp2' in multi-drug resistant bacterial strains].
AB  == recently, it has become more important to establish rapid and reliable methods for identifying bacterial species and their drug resistances because of the high  incidence of nosocomial infection caused by multi-drug resistant bacteria. at first, several enzymes were tested to evaluate the efficacy of dna extraction. n-acetylmuramidase, lysozyme and achromopeptidase were most effective to extract  dna from e. faecalis, e. faecium and s. aureus, respectively. after achromopeptidase extraction, the meca gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) in clinically isolated mrsa (95 strains), mssa (66), mrse (methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, 37), msse (methicillin-sensitive s. epidermidis, 1), s haemolyticus(5), s.hominis(1) and others (enterococcus, pseudomonas, and streptococcus, total 45). pcr products were analyzed by agarose  gel electrophoresis. the positive rates were 95% (mrsa), 1.5% (mssa), and 97% (mrse). the meca gene was also positive in 2/2 of methicillin-resistant s.haemolyticus and 2/3 of methicillin-sensitive s.haemolyticus and 1/1 of methicillin-resistant s.hominis. the meca gene was not detected in 45 non-staphylococcal strains. meca and fema gene by pcr and pbp 2' by irma were further detected in newly isolated mrsa (20 strains), mssa(20), mrse(14), msse(1) and s.simulans(2). complete correlation between mpipc susceptibility and meca were found. the fema gene was positive in 39/40 of s. aureus, and 0/14 of s.epidermidis, 2/3 of s.simulans. pbp2' were positive in 20/20 of mrsa, 0/20 of mssa, 14/14 of mrse, 0/1 of msse, 1/1 of methicillin-resistant s.simulans, and 0/2 of methicillin-sensitive s.simulans. in conclusion, diagnoses of mrsa by simultaneous detection of meca and fema gene as well as pbp2' are similarly useful because of their specificity and rapidity.

TI  == identification and composition of the streptococcal and enterococcal flora of tonsils, intestines and faeces of pigs.
AB  == streptococcus suis was the most frequent streptococcus spp. in pig tonsils, followed by the beta-haemolytic porcine 'equisimilis' ecovar of strep. dysgalactiae. the intestinal streptococcal flora was composed of strep. bovis, strep. hyointestinalis and strep. suis. many of these intestinal strep. suis belonged to a beta-glucuronidase-negative biotype which is infrequent in lesions. nearly half of the strains presumptively identified as strep. alactolyticus produced acid from lactose. this species was not found in tonsils and intestines  but was about equally prevalent as strep. hyointestinalis in pig faeces and rectal swabs. other streptococci were rare in this material. enterococci were much less frequently identified than streptococci in tonsils and faeces. in intestinal samples enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium, ent. hirae and ent. cecorum were most frequently found. in faeces ent. faecium was the most prevalent enterococcus. the characteristics of the less well known species strep. alactolyticus and strep. hyointestinalis are described in detail, and guidelines  for their differentiation from strep. bovis and strep. suis given.

AB  == gram-positive cocci were found in all meat samples of poultry slaughtered and processed for retail sale, at incidence rates ranging from 10(2) cfu/ml to 1.35 x 10(6) cfu/ml and a mode between 8 x 10(5) and 9 x 10(5) cfu/ml for 75% of the samples. the 93 isolated strains were identified as belonging to the following species: enterococcus faecalis (48 strains), e. faecium (16), e. avium (7), e. durans (4), aerococcus viridans (10), streptococcus morbillorum (2), s. salivarius (1), s. sanguis (1), s. "milleri" (1), s. pneumoniae (1), s. acidominimus (1), and gemella haemolysans (1). these species, which mainly colonize the intestinal tract, but may also be found in other parts of both the human and animal body, are pathogens or potentially such. their presence is an indication of the fecal contamination of meat processed following gutting of slaughtered chickens (endogenous contamination). a count of the gram-positive cocci and enterobacteria detected showed that enterococci were present in a far greater number than coliform bacteria.

TI  == in vitro activities of two glycylcyclines.
AB  == the in vitro activities of two glycylcyclines, cl 329,998 and cl 331,002 (two new semisynthetic tetracyclines), were evaluated in comparison with those of tetracycline and other available oral antimicrobial agents. a total of 523 recent clinical isolates were studied, including strains resistant to tetracycline. members of the family enterobacteriaceae were generally > or = 16-fold more susceptible to the glycylcyclines than to tetracycline (although less difference  was seen with proteus spp.). pseudomonas aeruginosa was modestly susceptible to both new compounds (mic for 90% of strains tested [mic90], 16 micrograms/ml). tetracycline- and methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus were all susceptible to the glycylcyclines (mic90 < or = 1  microgram/ml). streptococci (including streptococcus pneumoniae) and enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium displayed a bimodal distribution of susceptibility to tetracycline yet were uniformly susceptible to the glycylcyclines (mic90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). the glycylcyclines were highly potent against neisseria, moraxella, haemophilus, and bacteroides spp. (mic90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). strains of chlamydia spp. (three c. trachomatis strains and one c. pneumoniae strain) were inhibited by < or = 0.25 microgram of cl 329,998 or cl 331,002 per ml. two strains of mycoplasma pneumoniae were inhibited by < or = 0.12 microgram of cl 331,002 per ml and by 1 microgram of cl 329,998 per ml. mycobacterium tuberculosis and mycobacterium avium were resistant to the  two glycylcyclines (mic > or = 8 micrograms/ml). these results indicate that the  two glycylcyclines have potent in vitro activities against a wide range of clinically important pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == antilisterial activity by enterococci in a model predicting the temperature evolution of taleggio, an italian soft cheese.
AB  == enterococcus ssp. produced broad-spectrum bacteriocins, which were active against listeria innocua and listeria monocytogenes. inhibition of l. innocua in milk by  different starter cultures was evaluated. milk was inoculated with a conventional starter (streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus mixed cultures) as a sole starter or in combination with inhibitory starter cultures (enterococcus ssp., bacteriocin-producing strains). tests were performed under a temperature gradient that reproduced the first 55 h  of taleggio cheese manufacturing and in the presence of rennet. results indicated that satisfactory inhibition of l. innocua was linked to the combined synergistic antimicrobial effect of ph decrease and bacteriocin production. overall, data suggested that a potential existed for use of the antagonistic activity from enterococci for protection of taleggio cheese during ripening, when l. monocytogenes may often reach dangerous concentrations.

TI  == microbiological evaluation of jejunal aspirates and faecal samples after oral administration of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == a double-blind placebo controlled investigation was carried out to study the effect of peroral colonization. human volunteers were given mixtures of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria. measurements were made over a 1 week treatment period and for another week after the end of the treatment. two different bacteriological preparations were used, one consisted of enterococcus faecium and bifidobacterium longum (a total of 6.4 x 10(8) cfu d-1); the other consisted of lactobacillus acidophilus, bif. bifidum, lact. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus (a total of 9 x 10(9) cfu d-1). together with a placebo preparation, they were given to 24 healthy controls (eight in each group). microbiological examinations of jejunal aspirates showed that viable counts of most species were below the detection limit. however, the test preparation containing ent. faecium and bif. longum significantly reduced the anaerobe: aerobe ratio in faeces by a factor of three during treatment (p = 0.03), and increased it by a factor of 30 during the following week (p < 0.02). this study shows that peroral administration of certain bacterial cultures may affect the distal intestinal microflora.

TI  == endocarditis due to high level gentamicin resistant enterococcus faecium.
AB  == we describe the first reported case in the literature of bacterial endocarditis caused by enterococcus faecium that was highly resistant to gentamicin. the case  is unusual in that it followed a successfully treated streptococcus sanguis endocarditis. the micro-organism was susceptible only to the glycopeptide antibiotics, vancomycin and teicoplanin and to agents such as pristinamycin and daptomycin which are not routinely available for treatment. it illustrates the therapeutic dilemma posed by serious infections with such micro-organisms and supports previous observations that early heart valve replacement surgery may be  necessary to achieve cure of endocarditis due to enterococci which are highly resistant to gentamicin. it further emphasises the importance of screening for high-level aminoglycoside resistance in enterococci in all life threatening enterococcal infections, including endocarditis, septicaemia and meningitis when  aminoglycoside-penicillin synergy is required for successful treatment.

(b) catarrhalis and h. influenzae were better than those of flrx and lflx. spfx showed the highest activity against all gram-positive bacteria tested in this study. however, strains showed high mic (> or = 16 micrograms/ml) to spfx were found among mrsa,  e. faecalis, and e. faecium, whose isolation frequencies were 28.6%, 10.0%, and 6.7%, respectively. the results of this study suggest that resistant strains of gram-positive bacteria against new quinolone might increase among clinical isolates.

TI  == study of heterogeneity of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) genes in streptococci and enterococci by polymerase chain reaction: characterization of a  new cat determinant.
AB  == an assay based on the utilization of degenerate primers that enable enzymatic amplification of an internal fragment of cat genes known to be present in gram-positive cocci was developed to identify the genes encoding chloramphenicol  resistance in streptococci and enterococci. the functionality of this system was  illustrated by the detection of cat genes belonging to four different hydridization classes represented by the staphylococcal genes catpc221, catpc194, catpscs7, and the clostridial gene catp, and by the characterization of a new streptococcal cat gene designated cats. a sequence related to the clostridial catq gene, which was present in one streptococcal strain, was not detected by this assay. these results reveal that these six cat genes account for chromosomal-borne chloramphenicol resistance in 12 group a, b, and g streptococci tested. by contrast, only three of these six cat genes (catpc221, catpc194, and catpscs7) were detected on the 10 enterococcal plasmids studied here that encode  resistance to chloramphenicol.

TI  == effect of extracellularly generated singlet oxygen on gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == in the separated surface-sensitizer system, a photosensitizer is physically separated from the substrate by a thin air layer under such conditions that only  singlet oxygen can reach and oxidize the substrate, preventing the competition by type i photosensitized processes. this method has been used to study the reaction of singlet oxygen with gram-positive (streptococcus faecium) and gram-negative (escherichia coli) bacterial strains. studies on cell samples exposed to singlet  oxygen for different periods of time show a drastic decrease in survival for s. faecium, while e. coli becomes sensitive only when the integrity of the outer membrane is altered by treatment with cacl2 or tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (tris-edta). biochemical and ultrastructural analyses suggest that the cytoplasmic membrane and the genetic material are the main sites damaged by singlet oxygen.

TI  == multicentre survey of the comparative in-vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against bacteria from hospitalized patients in the british isles.
AB  == twenty-nine british and irish hospitals each collected up to 300 bacterial isolates from in-patients. the organisms were identified by an appropriate api system or, for staphylococci, by their gram and coagulase reactions. disc susceptibility tests were performed. isolates that gave zones < or = 25 mm to piperacillin/tazobactam (75 micrograms + 10 micrograms) discs were sent to a central laboratory for re-examination and determination of mic, together with a sample of the more susceptible organisms. results were evaluated for 6724 isolates. over 95% of the isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiellae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus, moraxella and bacteriodes, spp. streptococci, pneumococci and enterococcus faecalis were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam (defined as giving a zone > or = 22 mm to a 75 micrograms + 10 micrograms disc), as were 86% of acinetobacter spp. and 82% of the citrobacter, enterobacter, morganella and serratia group. tazobactam particularly extended the activity of piperacillin against e. coli isolates (96% susceptible cf. 61% to piperacillin alone) klebsiellae (95% cf. 70%), p. mirabilis (99% cf. 86%), and acinetobacter spp. (86% cf. 53%). occasional (18%) resistance in enterobacter, serratia and citrobacger spp. was probably caused by stable depression of class i beta-lactamases, which are inhibited poorly by tazobactam.  high resistance frequencies (> 25%) were found for enterococcus faecium and xanthomonas maltophilia. tazobactam potentiated piperacillin against beta-lactamase-producing methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, but the mode inhibition zone of piperacillin/tazobactam discs was only 26 mm, compared to 38 mm for beta-lactamase-negative isolates. nevertheless, fewer than 5% of the enzyme producers appeared resistant to 8 + 4 mg/l piperacillin/tazobactam in mic  tests. similar behaviour was noted for coagulase-negative staphylococci. amongst  the eleven comparator drugs, ceftazidime, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were as active as piperacillin/tazobactam against most enterobacteria. however, acinetobacter and bacteroides spp. and enterococci were resistant to ceftazidime, and bacteroides spp., enterococci, pneumococci and other streptococci were inherently resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. cefuroxime, ampicillin and  co-amoxiclav had narrower spectra. only imipenem showed a consistently wider spectrum and lower frequency of resistance than piperacillin/tazobactam.

TI  == the microbiologic aspects, including diagnosis, of beta-hemolytic streptococcal and enterococcal infections.
AB  == basic principles concerning the collection, transport, and processing of clinical specimens for the detection of streptococcaceae are given. identification of beta-hemolytic streptococci (s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, lancefield group c and g streptococci, s. anginosus) and enterococci is based on the careful observation of colony morphology and hemolytic pattern on sheep blood agar plates; subsequent genus or species confirmation is achieved by rather simple biochemical or enzymatic tests and by detection of streptococcal cell wall carbohydrate antigens (lancefield grouping). rapid antigen tests for the detection of group a and b streptococci directly from pharyngeal and vaginal swabs, respectively, are highly specific, thus allowing an immediate antibiotic therapy in patients with a positive test result. the reported sensitivities of these nonculture tests are too low to exclude streptococcal colonization or infection, however. the elucidation of the genetics of some major virulence factors of group a and b streptococci has contributed to knowledge of their association with disease, and  molecular techniques have supplemented the traditional (mostly culture and serologic) methods for an improved understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of streptococcal infections. recently employed examples include the  m protein gene typing of group a streptococci by oligonucleotide probes and the use of pcr assays for the detection of the genes encoding for the pyrogenic exotoxins. restriction enzyme endonuclease digestions of bacterial dna in association with dna fragment separation by conventional or pfge have been applied successfully to several species of streptococcaceae (e.g., s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae). enterococci are important pathogens in the hospital setting, exhibiting high morbidity and mortality rates in bacteremic patients with severe  underlying disease. molecular typing methods have clearly confirmed their potential to be nosocomially transmitted. e. faecalis and e. faecium still account for the majority of human infections, but some of the newer enterococcal  species (at present 19 species are recognized) have been encountered as well. the definitive species identification of enterococci requires the performance of an array of biochemical tests. the increasing antimicrobial resistance of enterococci, including high-level resistance to penicillins and aminoglycosides and occasionally also to glycopeptides, has hampered standard therapeutic regimens. all enterococci isolated from serious infections should be tested for high-level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance by one of several methods evaluated; beta-lactamase production (primarily found in e. faecalis) is reliably detected by the nitrocefin test.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of aspoxicillin (aspc) in terms of minimum inhibitory  concentration (mics) was compared with those of other penicillin antibiotics (pcs) against clinical isolates sent to us from medical institutions throughout japan in 1988, 1990 and 1992 and strains isolated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections. 1. the mic80's of aspc against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus spp., escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis  group were almost the same as those against these isolates in 1985 to 1986. 2. a  trend for increasing susceptibility to pcs including aspc was observed in the isolates of s. aureus and haemophilus influenzae. this trend in s. aureus was attributed to the appearance of non beta-lactamase producing strains associated with the development of highly resistant strains among the methicillin-resistant  s. aureus (mrsa) as well as to a tendency toward yearly decreasing frequency of mrsa. the trend for the increased susceptibility in h. influenzae was related to  the decrease in the number of beta-lactamase production strains. 3. the frequency of the strains highly resistant to pcs including aspc increased. 4. no pcs-resistant strains were observed among the so-called beta-streptococci, while  among alpha-streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae there was a trend for decreasing frequency of strains with lower susceptibility to pcs or those with resistant to pcs. these strains may be variants which were also resistant to cephems and had penicillin-binding proteins (pbps). meanwhile, a high frequency of highly pcs-resistant strains were noted among enterococcus faecium. in view of the fact that the pcs-resistance of e. faecium is known to be related to pbps, the pattern of the susceptibility of the recent clinical isolates to beta-lactams is considered to be multimodal.

TI  == evaluation of new streptococcal latex grouping kit.
AB  == aims: to evaluate a new streptococcal latex grouping kit (shield diagnostics ltd) and compare it against an established latex agglutination method (streptex; wellcome diagnostics). methods: two hundred and forty seven strains of streptococci and enterococci were tested with each kit by one operator and according to the manufacturer's instructions. strains failing to group or giving  discordant results were identified to species level. results: two discrepant grouping results were observed and 13 non-beta haemolytic streptococci failed to  group with either product. the shield kit successfully identified 232 isolates at 15 minutes of enzyme extraction incubation compared with 224 and 233 on short (15 minutes) and long (1 hour) incubations, respectively, for streptex (p > 0.23 for  both comparisons). on short incubation only, the shield kit detected significantly more strains of enterococcus faecium (p = 0.007). the reaction strengths were similar for both kits (p > 0.16). no cross-reactions were observed but the streptex kit produced significantly fewer tests with visible granularity  (p < 0.003). conclusions: although the shield product appeared to detect group d  antigen more readily, overall no important differences in performance were observed. prospective users of the new method should first become familiar with its characteristics.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was tested  in vitro by an agar dilution method against 200 clinical isolates (gram-negative/positive aerobes and anaerobes). meropenem was compared with imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin; and metronidazole, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, vancomycin when appropriate. meropenem and imipenem exhibited an extended spectrum of activity with low minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). only one strain each of enterococcus faecium and pseudomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia were resistant. of the carbapenems, imipenem was slightly more active against enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococci, but meropenem was obviously more active against enterobacteriaceae and clostridium perfringens. both, meropenem and imipenem had similar activities towards pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, streptococcus pyogenes and bacteroides sp. all other antibiotics tested were less potent than the carbapenems with the exception of ciprofloxacin  which generally exhibited similar antibacterial activities, except for anaerob microorganisms.

TI  == [a comparative microbiological and pharmacokinetic activity of vancomycin and teicoplanin].
AB  == vancomycin and teicoplanin are two commercially available glycopeptide antibiotics. they have identical spectra of activity and similar mechanisms of action, and both are complex molecules. in vitro, vancomycin is more active against coagulase-negative staphylococci, while teicoplanin is more active against enterococci and pneumococci. the activity of the two antibiotics against  staphylococcus aureus is similar. the serum pharmacokinetics of vancomycin and teicoplanin are highly different, teicoplanin having a longer elimination half-life (40 hours versus 6-8 hours for vancomycin), but a higher degree of protein binding (90% versus 55%). we compared the two antibiotics on the basis of their inhibitory quotient kinetics, using the mic90 values for the above bacterial species as the microbiological parameters, and the total and free (non-protein bound) serum concentrations as the pharmacokinetic parameters. the inhibitory quotient kinetics of vancomycin were always more favorable in terms of the free concentrations, even against those bacteria for which the teicoplanin mic was lower.

AB  == hybridization was used to investigate the distribution of enterococcal plasmid sequences among 306 strains of enterococcus and streptococcus spp. isolated from  faeces of humans of various ages. as dna probes for the survey three plasmids, whose dnas did not hybridize each other and designated as pms13, ptw34 and phk30, were selected from plasmids borne in ent. faecalis. ptw34 dna hybridized only with dnas from enterococci, with high frequency in ent. faecalis and low frequency in ent. faecium. pms13 dna hybridized with dnas of all enterococcus spp. tested and with strep. bovis, strep. equinus and strep. salivarius. eighty-five percent of ent. faecium isolates had sequences homologous to pms13 but in the other species the values were less than 60%. some enterococci had dnas which hybridized with the phk30 probe. the different distribution of the three dna sequences indicates the possibility that plasmid dnas encode advantageous phenotypes for the colonization of bacteria in the lumen of the bowel.

TI  == characterization of enterococcal isolates by restriction enzyme analysis of genomic dna.

TI  == extracellular and cellular distribution of muramidase-2 and muramidase-1 of enterococcus hirae atcc 9790.
AB  == a substantial portion of the second peptidoglycan hydrolase (muramidase-2) activity of enterococcus hirae atcc 9790 (formerly streptococcus faecium) is present in the supernatant culture medium. in contrast, nearly all muramidase-1 activity is associated with cells in the latent, proteinase-activatable form. muramidase-2 activity is produced and secreted throughout growth, with maximal levels attained at or near the end of exponential growth in a rich organic medium. muramidase-2 activity in the culture medium remained high even during overnight incubations in the absence of proteinase inhibitors. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of supernatant culture medium concentrated by 60% saturated ammonium sulfate precipitation showed the presence  of several coomassie blue-staining bands. one intensely staining protein band, at about 71 kda, selectively adsorbed to the insoluble peptidoglycan fraction of cell walls of e. hirae, retained muramidase-2 activity, and reacted in western immunoblots with monoclonal antibodies to muramidase-2. the mobility of extracellular muramidase-2 in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was indistinguishable from that of muramidase-2 extracted with 6  m guanidine hydrochloride from intact bacteria. muramidase-2 appears to have only a limited number of binding sites on the peptidoglycan of e. hirae cell walls but binds with high affinity. although high levels of muramidase-2 activity were present in supernatants of stationary-phase cultures, the bacteria were resistant to autolysis. thus it appears that the peptidoglycan in walls of intact cells of  e. hirae is somehow protected from the hydrolytic action of extracellular muramidase-2.

AB  == the beta-lactam resistance of genus streptococcus has been explained by the low binding affinity of penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) to the drug. this study was carried out to resolve the mechanisms of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in the species of genus enterococcus by means of binding affinities of pbps. streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and  enterococcus avium were employed as assay microbes. cefepime (cfpm) and ampicillin (abpc) were used as representatives of cephems and penicillins, respectively. all the pbp fractions of s. pyogenes manifested high binding affinities to cfpm and abpc, whereas pbps 1 and 4 of e. faecalis showed high binding affinities to abpc but not to cfpm. in e. faecium, pbps of an exceptionally penicillin-susceptible strain manifested a high binding affinity to abpc, but pbps 5 and 6 showed low affinities to cfpm. beta-lactam resistant strains of e. faecium possessed pbps 5 and 6 with low binding affinities to cfpm  and abpc. all the fractions of pbps but pbp 1 in e. avium showed low binding affinities to cfpm. although all the pbp fractions but pbps 3 and 6 manifested high binding affinities to abpc, pbps 3 and 6 showed low binding affinities to abpc. a strain of e. avium, which is susceptible to abpc but moderately resistant to cfpm, lacked pbp 6. in conclusion, the resistance of e. avium to cfpm is based upon low binding affinities of the many fractions to this drug, and abpc resistance is based upon pbps 3 and 6 with low binding affinities to abpc.

TI  == differences in the formation of poles of enterococcus and bacillus.
AB  == the pole of enterococcus hirae (streptococcus faecium) is more pointed than that  of bacillus subtilis; i.e. the pole of the former is prolate and the latter is oblate. both species form their poles by constructing annular additions on the inside surface. in both cases, the thick septum starts to split from the outside  before the septum is complete. physiochemical considerations dictate that the peptidoglycan must be unstretched as laid down. however, it later becomes stressed and may stretch to increase its surface area or to change its shape. our earlier analysis for b. subtilis demonstrated that, without the addition of new peptidoglycan, the nascent wall is stretched after it is externalized to 1.51 times the original area. the wall of partially formed poles that is already exteriorized continues to deform with further development. for e. hirae, higgins  & shockman's measurements showed that the completed pole has a surface area 2.18  times larger than a completed septal disk and the wall changes shape very little  after exteriorization. a model is presented here for the streptococcus in which the septal wall does not increase its surface area on exteriorization either by expansion or by murein insertion. instead, the septal wall as it is split and exteriorized twists to become oblique, increasing the inner radius of the incomplete septum. in consequence of this rotation, extra layers of peptidoglycan are added to the inside face of the developing septum. this additional murein forms the more pointed pole shape for e. hirae. this "split-and-splay" model thus refines and extends the surface stress theory of e. hirae developed a decade ago  by proposing a source of the extra wall needed for the formation of its prolate,  more pointed, pole.

TI  == [in vitro bactericidal effect of temafloxacin and tosufloxacin against streptococci].
AB  == tosufloxacin tosylate (tosu) and temafloxacin hydrochloride (tema) were tested in vitro against 248 clinical isolates of various species of streptococci recovered  in a hospital microbiology laboratory (bellevue regional teaching hospital). species included s. pneumoniae (n = 20), group a streptococci (n = 22), group b streptococci (n = 30), group g streptococci (n = 17), group d s. bovis (n = 19),  enterococcus faecium (n = 45), enterococcus faecalis (n = 28), s. sanguis (n = 21), s. milleri (n = 29) and s. mitis (n = 17). activities of each of the two study drugs were evaluated comparatively with two other fluoroquinolones, i.e., ciprofloxacin (cip) and pefloxacin (pef). activities of each of these four antibiotics, expressed as the mic 90%, varied as follows according to the species of streptococci: tosu, 0.25 to 1 mg/l, tema 0.5 to 2 mg/l, cip, 1 to 4 mg/l and pef 8 to 32 mgl. overall, tosu and tema exhibited the greatest activity of the various species. the size of the inoculum had no significant effect on mic values.

TI  == selection and application of streptococcus bovis as a silage inoculant.
AB  == three strains of streptococcus bovis, a homolactic bacterium capable of utilizing starch, were evaluated for growth kinetics and ability to decrease the ph of alfalfa silage. a selected strain was evaluated for its competitiveness as an inoculant with enterococcus faecium, an organism used in inoculants, and for its  ability to enhance the effect of a commercial inoculant. testing was completed over three studies using wilted alfalfa (28 to 34% dry matter) ensiled into laboratory silos. treatments were control, e. faecium, e. faecium and commercial  inoculant, s. bovis, and s. bovis and commercial inoculant. replicate silos were  emptied and analyzed at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 40 days for ph, fermentation products, and nitrogen fractions. s. bovis alone lowered the ph quicker and improved silage parameters early in the fermentation compared with e. faecium, the commercial inoculant, and control treatments. when combined with a commercial inoculant, s. bovis lowered ph more quickly than the commercial inoculant alone and e. faecium plus commercial inoculant. at 40 days, s. bovis combination had lower ph and ammonia nitrogen and acetate contents than the e. faecium combination. starch in the silage was not utilized by s. bovis as had been anticipated. results indicate that s. bovis was more effective than e. faecium as a silage inoculant and could enhance a commercial inoculant on low-dry-matter alfalfa.

TI  == thermal susceptibility of streptococcus faecium strains isolated from frankfurters.
AB  == the heat resistance of nine strains of streptococcus faecium isolated from frankfurters was determined at 63 and 68 degrees c in brain heart infusion broth. exponential-phase cultures (approximately 10(7) colonies/ml) were used as inoculants. the heat resistance of s. faecium dp2181, a moderately resistant isolate, was further examined in broth (55, 63, and 68 degrees c) and frankfurter emulsion (63 and 68 degrees c). the decimal reduction times (d values) were determined by regression. in broth, both time-temperature combinations resulted in a 3-4 log decline in bacterial numbers for the nine s. faecium strains tested. for s. faecium dp2181, the survivor curves deviated from the logarithmic order of death at all three heating temperatures. an initial slow period of death was evident at 55 degrees c and a resistant tail of organisms was observed at 55, 63, and 68 degrees c. the d55d63, and, d68 values for the logarithmic portion of the  corresponding survivor curves were 105.6, 9.36, and 3.34 min, respectively. the survival of dp2181 was enhanced by the frankfurter emulsion. the results indicate that populations of s. faecium existed that were very heat resistant and could survive normal frankfurter processing if initially present in high numbers.

AB  == counts of escherichia coli, faecal streptococci and enterococci were made on faecal specimens from human and animal origin and urban raw sewage waters, with microtiter plates containing selective substances. escherichia coli was more numerous than faecal streptococci and enterococci in 80% of the samples regardless of the origin. consequently the use of the ratio e. coli/faecal streptococci to distinguish human from animal origin of faecal pollution is questionable. enterococcus faecalis was predominant in human and poultry faeces,  streptococcus bovis was typical of the bovine faeces and to a lesser extent also  of pig faeces whereas enterococcus durans, ent. hirae and ent. faecium did not characterize any faecal source. streptococcus bovis could be distinguished in the microtiter plate by its inability to reduce triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (ttc)  in the medium.

TI  == the evaluation of residual antimicrobial activity on hands and its clinical relevance.
AB  == a model for evaluation of the residual activity of agents used for hygienic hand  disinfection, which relates closely to the "in-use" setting, is described. we looked for residual activity following hand disinfection by a standard method with soap and water and four skin disinfectants in common use. two test organisms known to have caused cross-infection and having clinically-significant antibiotic resistance were used: a strain of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and one of gentamicin-multiply-resistant enterobacter cloacae. both organisms survived well on artificially inoculated hands. residual activity on previously disinfected hands against both test organisms was most marked for alcoholic chlorhexidine ('hibisol') which showed a 4 log10 reduction within 1 min of inoculation. chlorhexidine digluconate skin cleanser ('hibiscrub') and povidone-iodine surgical scrub ('betadine') also had marked residual activity, but less than alcoholic chlorhexidine. 60% isopropanol showed no residual activity and, except for marginal activity against e. cloacae, soap and water showed little residual activity. the residual activity of alcoholic chlorhexidine may be useful to control cross-infection with those multiply-resistant strains which survive well on fingers previously washed with soap and water.

AB  == this study shows for the first time microheterogeneity of 1,3-linked poly(glycerophosphate) lipoteichoic acids. the lipoteichoic acids investigated were those of enterococcus faecalis kiel 27738 (i), enterococcus hirae (streptococcus faecium) atcc 9790 (ii), and leuconostoc mesenteroides dms 20343 (iii). lipoteichoic acids ii and iii are partially substituted by mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra-alpha-d-glucopyranosyl residues with (1----2) interglycosidic linkages. lipoteichoic acid i is substituted with alpha-kojibiosyl residues only. lipoteichoic acids i and iii additionally carry d-alanine ester. lipoteichoic acids were separated on columns of concanavalin-a-sepharose according to their increasing number of glycosyl substituents per chain. it was evident that all molecular species are usually glycosylated and that alanine ester and glycosyl residues occur on the same chains. the chain lengths of lipoteichoic acid i and ii vary between 9-40 glycerophosphate residues, whereas those of lipoteichoic acid iii appear to be uniform (33 +/- 2 residues). molecular species differ in the extent of glycosylation but their content of alanyl residues is fairly constant. all lipoteichoic acids contain a small fraction (5-15%) different in composition from the bulk and most likely reflecting an early stage of biosynthesis. two procedures for chain length determination of poly(glycerophosphate) lipoteichoic acids are described.

AB  == high-level glycopeptide resistance in enterococcus faecium bm4147 is mediated by  a 38-kda protein vana, whose amino acid sequence is related to gram-negative d-alanine:d-alanine (d-ala-d-ala) ligases [dutka-malen, s., molinas, c., arthur,  m., & courvalin, p. (1990) mol. gen. genet. 224, 364-372]. we report purification of vana and demonstrate that it has d-ala-d-ala ligase activity but has substantially modified substrate specificity, compared with gram-negative d-ala-d-ala ligases. vana preferentially condenses d-ala with d-met or d-phe, raising the possibility that its cellular role is to synthesize a modified cell-wall component, which is subsequently not recognized by vancomycin.

AB  == vancomycin resistance has recently been recognized among clinical isolates of enterococci. resistance is inducible, and associated with production of a novel 39 kda membrane protein. the mechanism by which exposure to vancomycin, which does not penetrate the cell membrane, induces resistance is unknown. in the vancomycin resistant strain enterococcus faecium 228, resistance was also inducible by moenomycin, suggesting that inhibition of the transglycosylation step in peptidoglycan synthesis may be required for induction of resistance. cytoplasmic pools of peptidoglycan precursors were increased after exposure to vancomycin or moenomycin, representing a potential means for regulation of induction.

AB  == vancomycin-inducible proteins of 39.5 and 39 kda from respectively, low-level and high-level resistant enterococci were compared. electrophoretic, immunoblot and peptide analysis revealed three types of protein, one in a low-level resistant strain of e. faecium, one in 2 high-level-resistant strains of e. faecium, and one in a high-level resistant strain of e. faecalis. the inducible proteins of e. faecium and e. faecalis, of 39.5 and 39 kda respectively, which may function in a similar fashion (al-obeid et al. (1990) antimicrob. agents chemother. 34, 252-256), are not related immunologically.

TI  == technologically important characteristics of enterococcus isolates from milk and  dairy products.
AB  == enterococcus faecium (54 strains), e. faecalis (40 strains), and e. durans (14) were isolated from various dairy products (raw milk, cream, butter and fermented  milk products) during a previous study (wessels et al., 1988). in this article various characteristics of these isolates, which may have a bearing on their significance in dairy products, have been studied. a large percentage of the identified strains of all three species were able to grow at 7 degrees c. seventy-six percent of the e. faecium strains, 62% e. faecalis and 50% e. durans  strains also showed proteolytic activity at psychrotrophic temperatures. the fact that proteolytic activity could be detected within 2 days at 7 degrees c is significant, since bulk cooled milk is normally held for 3 to 4 days at temperatures between 4 and 7 degrees c at farms or factories prior to processing. this examination confirmed that enterococci are proteolytic rather than lipolytic.

TI  == the activity in vitro of trospectomycin sulphate (u-63366f) against aminoglycoside-resistant enterococci.
AB  == trospectomycin (u-63366f), a 6'-propyl analogue of spectinomycin, was tested against aminoglycoside-resistant enterococci. the mic90 for enterococcus faecalis was 4 mg/l and that for e. faecium was 8 mg/l. trospectomycin alone was not bactericidal for enterococci, with mbc90 4096 mg/l for both e. faecalis and e. faecium. the addition of commercially available polyvalent immunoglobulin decreased significantly both the mics and the mbcs and the rendered trospectomycin bactericidal for enterococci. chequerboard titration of a combination of trospectomycin with ampicillin revealed an fic index of 1.0 for all the isolates tested. time-kill curves also did not show any enhancement of bactericidal activity of ampicillin when combined with trospectomycin. a combination of ampicillin and gentamicin was synergistic for enterococci under similar experimental conditions. trospectomycin can be used as a safe alternative to aminoglycosides or beta-lactam antibiotics in enterococcal infection where bactericidal activity is not required, or in the event of serious side effects from these two classes of antibiotics.

TI  == biological characterization of a new radioactive labeling reagent for bacterial penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  == radiolabeled penicillin g is widely used as the imaging agent in penicillin-binding protein (pbp) assays. the disadvantages of most forms of labeled penicillin g are instability on storage and the long exposure times usually required for autoradiography or fluorography of electrophoretic gels. we  investigated the utility of radioiodinated penicillin v as an alternative reagent. radioiodination of p-(trimethylstannyl)penicillin v with [125i]na, using a modification of the chloramine-t method, is simple, high yielding, and site specific. we demonstrated the general equivalence of commercially obtained [3h]penicillin g and locally synthesized [125i]penicillin v (ipv) in their recognition of bacterial pbps. profiles of pbps in membranes from bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, providencia rettgeri, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium labeled with ipv or [3h]penicillin g were virtually identical. use of ipv as the imaging  agent in competition experiments for determination of the affinities of various beta-lactam antibiotics for the pbps of e. coli yielded results similar to those  obtained in experiments with [3h]penicillin g. dried electrophoretic gels from typical pbp experiments, using ipv at 37.3 ci/mmol and 30 micrograms/ml, exposed  x-ray film in 8 to 24 h. the stability of ipv on storage at 4 degrees c was inversely proportional to specific activity. at 37.3 ci/mmol and 60 micrograms/ml, ipv retained useful activity for at least 60 days at 4 degrees c.  ipv represents a practical and stable reagent for rapid pbp assays.

TI  == species identities of enterococci isolated from clinical specimens.

TI  == enterococcal resistance to vancomycin and related cyclic glycopeptide antibiotics.
AB  == enterococci belonging to various species resistant to vancomycin and related cyclic glycopeptide antibiotics have been isolated from hospitalized patients in  france, the uk and the usa. all such strains examined display inducible synthesis of a membrane protein associated with resistance. the mechanism by which the membrane protein acts has not been definitively established, but it may block the access of the antibiotic to its peptidoglycan target. that the protein could be a bypass enzyme has not been ruled out. transfer of glycopeptide resistance by conjugation to either enterococcus faecium or enterococcus faecalis and by transformation of streptococcus sanguis challis has been reported. the structural and regulatory genes encoding this resistance can be localized on plasmid and, apparently, chromosomal dna. the plasmids encoding this resistance appear to differ from each other and have variable host ranges, but share at least some dna sequence homology.

TI  == microbiologic characteristics of lactobacillus products used for colonization of  the vagina.
AB  == lactobacilli have long been considered to be the protective flora in the vagina.  women with vaginal infections have used various non-prescription products in an attempt to restore their normal vaginal flora. products that contain lactobacilli include dairy products (yogurt, acidophilus milk) and commercially available lactobacillus powders and tablets. recently, lactobacillus species that produce hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) have been associated with normal vaginal flora. in this  study, we compared 16 non-prescription products containing lactobacilli for h2o2  production, purity, and identifiable contaminants. all 16 products contained lactobacilli, of which ten (62%) produced h2o2. at least one contaminant was detected in 11 of 16 (69%) of the products: enterococcus faecium (ten), clostridium sporogenes (one), streptococcus mitis (one), and pseudomonas species  (one). although all of the products tested contained lactobacilli, only four of the products contained lactobacillus acidophilus. most of the lactobacilli-containing products currently available either do not contain the lactobacillus species advertised and/or contain other bacteria of questionable benefit. we conclude that commercially available products may not be appropriate  for recolonization of the vagina.

TI  == mechanism of resistance to vancomycin in enterococcus faecium d366 and enterococcus faecalis a256.
AB  == the role of the glycopeptide-inducible proteins of enterococcus faecium d366 (39.5 kilodaltons) and enterococcus faecalis a256 (39 kilodaltons) in the mechanism of resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin was examined. crude cell walls from noninduced cells or from induced cells treated with sodium dodecyl sulfate to remove the inducible proteins were shown to bind vancomycin, in contrast to cell walls containing the cytoplasmic membrane-associated induced proteins, which did not bind vancomycin. cytoplasmic membranes from vancomycin-induced cells did not inactivate (bind) vancomycin or teicoplanin, but they could protect the glycopeptides from being bound to the synthetic pentapeptide. this protection could be competitively abolished by d-alanyl-d-alanine. a decrease in glycopeptide binding to the pentapeptide was observed in a time-dependent fashion after treatment of the pentapeptide with the cytoplasmic membranes from induced cells. we hypothesize that the inducible proteins are responsible for glycopeptide resistance due to the binding to, and subsequent enzymatic modification of, the pentapeptide precursor of peptidoglycan, which is considered to be the natural target of glycopeptides.

TI  == the life and times of the enterococcus.
AB  == enterococci are important human pathogens that are increasingly resistant to antimicrobial agents. these organisms were previously considered part of the genus streptococcus but have recently been reclassified into their own genus, called enterococcus. to date, 12 species pathogenic for humans have been described, including the most common human isolates, enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. enterococci cause between 5 and 15% of cases of endocarditis, which is best treated by the combination of a cell wall-active agent (such as penicillin or vancomycin, neither of which alone is usually bactericidal) and an aminoglycoside to which the organism is not highly resistant; this characteristically results in a synergistic bactericidal effect. high-level resistance (mic, greater than or equal to 2,000 micrograms/ml) to the aminoglycoside eliminates the expected bactericidal effect, and such resistance has now been described for all aminoglycosides. enterococci can also cause urinary tract infections; intraabdominal, pelvic, and wound infections; superinfections (particularly in patients receiving expanded-spectrum cephalosporins); and bacteremias (often together with other organisms). they are  now the third most common organism seen in nosocomial infections. for most of these infections, single-drug therapy, most often with penicillin, ampicillin, or vancomycin, is adequate. enterococci have a large number of both inherent and acquired resistance traits, including resistance to cephalosporins, clindamycin,  tetracycline, and penicillinase-resistant penicillins such as oxacillin, among others. the most recent resistance traits reported are penicillinase resistance (apparently acquired from staphylococci) and vancomycin resistance, both of which can be transferred to other enterococci. it appears likely that we will soon be faced with increasing numbers of enterococci for which there is no adequate therapy.

AB  == the membrane-bound 43,000-mr penicillin-binding protein no. 6 (pbp6) of enterococcus hirae consists of a 30,000-mr dd-peptidase/penicillin-binding domain and a approximately 130-residue c-terminal appendage. removal of this appendage by trypsin proteolysis has no marked effect on the catalytic activity and penicillin-binding capacity of the pbp. anchorage of the pbp in the membrane appears to be mediated by a short 15-20-residue stretch at the c-terminal end of  the appendage. the sequence of the 50-residue n-terminal region of the pbp shows  high degree of homology with the sequences of the corresponding regions of the pbps5 of escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis. on this basis the active-site serine residue occurs at position 35 in the enterococcal pbp.

TI  == inducible resistance to vancomycin in enterococcus faecium d366.
AB  == strain d366, a clinical isolate of enterococcus faecium, is resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic] 32 mg/l) to vancomycin. when exponential-phase cultures were exposed to half the mic of vancomycin, a lag of 3-4 h occurred before growth resumed. cells preexposed to 1/2 mics of vancomycin did not show any lag. pregrowth of d366 with vancomycin caused resistance to all glycopeptides tested. pregrowth in vancomycin resulted in synthesis of a 3.95-kda cytoplasmic-membrane-associated protein. this protein was correlated with resistance in mutants with high-level resistance, in the presence of nacl, which  inhibited the activity of vancomycin, and when several glycopeptides with varying activities were tested. vancomycin-grown cells appeared abnormal and lysed at a much slower rate than did normal cells. we conclude that (1) vancomycin resistance in d366 is inducible; (2) resistance is correlated with the synthesis  of 39.5-kda cytoplasmic membrane protein; and (3) this protein play an additional role in the inhibition of normal lytic functions.

TI  == high-level penicillin resistance among isolates of enterococci. implications for  treatment of enterococcal infections.
AB  == study objective: to determine the extent and clinical significance of high-level  penicillin-resistant enterococcus faecium at our institution. design: surveillance of clinical enterococcal isolates, in-vitro susceptibility and timed survival studies, and determination of antibiotic efficacy in an experimental model of enterococcal endocarditis. measurements and main results: for a 6-month  period, 14% of enterococcal isolates (30 of 212) were identified as e. faecium. one third of the isolates were highly resistant to penicillin g (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic], greater than or equal to 200 micrograms/ml) but did not produce beta-lactamase. the findings from in-vitro survival studies showed that this high-level resistance resulted in the loss of bactericidal activity normally observed when an aminoglycoside antibiotic agent is combined with penicillin. an experimental rat model of endocarditis provided in-vivo data  that confirmed our in-vitro observations. after the rats received therapy for 72  hours, penicillin g either alone or in combination with gentamicin did not significantly decrease the numbers of enterococci in vegetations on heart valves  compared with untreated controls (p = 0.62 and p = 0.58, respectively). conclusions: enterococcus faecium accounts for a notable proportion of clinical enterococcal isolates. many strains from patients at our institution, as well as  from patients at other institutions throughout the country, are highly resistant  to penicillin. because high-level penicillin resistance has important therapeutic implications, periodic surveillance and mic testing of significant enterococcal isolates, especially e. faecium, are suggested.

AB  == investigations of the clinical role of enterococci have been limited largely to enterococcal bacteremia and endocarditis and have not distinguished between the various species of enterococci. to characterize the full spectrum of enterococcal disease and to determine whether clinically important differences exist among infections and/or instances of colonization (infections/colonizations) by the various enterococcal species, cases of enterococcal infection/colonization diagnosed at the dallas veterans administration medical center (dvamc) in 1986 were reviewed. during this period, 220 enterococcus faecalis, 21 enterococcus faecium, 12 enterococcus avium, and no enterococcus durans isolates were identified in clinical specimens (other than stool) submitted to the dvamc microbiology laboratory. clinical characteristics of cases of infection/colonization by the three species of enterococci were similar and did not vary significantly when blood stream invasion occurred. nevertheless, mortality data and therapeutic response rates suggested differences in virulence  of the three enterococcal species. enterococcal infections/colonizations (including bacteremia) frequently were polymicrobial. although enterobacteriaceae were the most common copathogens identified overall, staphylococcus aureus was the most common copathogen in bloodstream infections. e. avium was more resistant than e. faecalis or e. faecium to penicillin g and ampicillin and less resistant  to most other antimicrobial agents. the results of this investigation suggest that enterococci are a heterogeneous group of bacteria that should not be treated as a single entity in clinical investigations.

TI  == effect of cell cycle stages on the central density of enterococcus faecium atcc 9790.
AB  == cultures of enterococcus faecium growing at various rates were examined for timing of cell division cycle events by using the method of residual divisions and a morphological analysis. both methods gave essentially the same timing for the onset of d1 (completion of chromosome replication) and of d2 (completion of septation). frequencies of cells exhibiting a phase-reversed center in bovine serum albumin at various growth rates were determined. the data fit a model in which rapidly growing cells increase in refractive index (which is assumed to represent central density) at completion of the chromosome replication cycle involved in the ongoing division, whereas slowly growing cultures increase in central density at the time of completion of septation. there was no correlation  between the timing of increase in central density and the timing of initiation of new sites of surface growth.

TI  == regulation of the cytoplasmic ph by a proton-translocating atpase in streptococcus faecalis (faecium). a computer simulation.
AB  == earlier work from this laboratory led to the proposal that the cytoplasmic ph of  streptococcal cells is regulated solely by changes in the amount and activity of  a proton-translocating atpase, f1f0 complex [kobayashi, h., suzuki, t. & unemoto, t. (1986) j. biol. chem. 261, 627-630]. we have now examined the proposal with the aid of computer simulation. we find that an increase in the amount of the h+-atpase is necessary for ph regulation and is sufficient to maintain a constant steady-state cytoplasmic ph. an increase in h+-atpase activity is insufficient by itself to maintain a constant cytoplasmic ph, but suppresses the initial fluctuation of the ph. when both variations were allowed, the simulated cytoplasmic ph remained constant despite large perturbations, suggesting that this regulatory system has ample capacity to compensate for ph changes. the present work shows that a computer simulation is a useful way to examine a model  for biological regulatory system; application of the simulation to other regulatory systems is discussed.

TI  == penicillin-aminoglycoside synergy and post-antibiotic effect for enterococci.
AB  == the post-antibiotic effect (pae) on seven strains of enterococci was studied using a novel atp method and conventional viable counting. there was a good correlation between the results of the two techniques. in strains exhibiting low-level resistance to penicillin and streptomycin, paes of 1 to 2.4 h (mean 1.8 h) resulted from exposure to penicillin; shorter paes were induced by streptomycin (0.2-0.3 h; mean 0.2 h). addition of streptomycin to pencillin increased the duration of penicillin-induced paes by two-fold to three-fold. enterococci exhibiting high-level streptomycin resistance but low-level penicillin resistance did not exhibit a pae with streptomycin but exhibited a short pae with gentamicin (0.3-0.6 h). for these strains, the addition of gentamicin, but not streptomycin, to penicillin increased the penicillin-induced  paes. penicillin alone or in combination with streptomycin or gentamicin did not  induce paes for a single strain of enterococcus faecium which exhibited high-level resistance to both penicillin and streptomycin. during penicillin-induced paes, extracellular atp was detectable and only during this time period were enterococci susceptible to the action of gentamicin. the addition of aminoglycosides to penicillin not only extended the pae for enterococci but also the periods when organisms leaked atp and were susceptible to growth inhibition by gentamicin.

TI  == dna probe for identification of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == a total of 287 clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) were  tested for their ability to undergo autolysis when treated with sodium deoxycholate. the test was positive for all but one isolate, strain doc-1. this autolysis required the activity of an enzyme which is unique and characteristic of s. pneumoniae: a choline-dependent n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, the gene product of the lyta gene. we used lyta as a dna probe to test the distribution of the autolysin gene among clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae. in dot blot hybridization experiments our probe reacted with the dna of 60 of 60 strains tested, including the autolysis-deficient clinical isolate doc-1. no hybridization occurred when strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus bovis were tested. the lyta gene appears to be an ideal candidate for use as a dna probe for the identification of s. pneumoniae.

TI  == transferable vancomycin and teicoplanin resistance in enterococcus faecium.
AB  == enterococcus faecium bm4165 and bm4178, isolated from immunocompromised patients, one treated with vancomycin, were inducibly resistant to high levels of the glycopeptide antibiotics vancomycin and teicoplanin but susceptible to the new lipopeptide daptomycin (ly146032). strain bm4165 was also resistant to macrolidelincosamide-streptogramin b-type (mls) antibiotics. the genes conferring resistance to glycopeptides and to mls antibiotics in strain bm4165 were carried  on plasmids pip819 and pip821, respectively; pip819 also carried genes that encoded resistance to mls antibiotics. the two plasmids, which were distinct although related, were self-transferable to other e. faecium strains. plasmid pip819 could also conjugate to e. faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, s. pyogenes, s. lactis, and listeria monocytogenes, in which it conferred inducible glycopeptide resistance, but not to s. aureus. glycopeptide-inactivating activity was not detected, and the biochemical mechanism of resistance remains unknown. based on this first report of transferable resistance to glycopeptides, we anticipate dissemination of resistance to these antibiotics in gram-positive cocci and bacilli in which it can be phenotypically expressed.

TI  == laboratory detection of high-level aminoglycoside-aminocyclitol resistance in enterococcus spp.
AB  == methods for detection of high-level resistance to aminoglycoside-aminocyclitol antibiotics were evaluated using 104 blood isolates of enterococci (97 enterococcus faecalis and 7 enterococcus faecium). kanamycin was used to predict  resistance to amikacin. discrepancies between methods were resolved by time-kill  studies. four methods (microscan, macrotube, microtiter, and disk diffusion) for  detecting resistance to gentamicin and streptomycin were compared, using 51 consecutive strains. there were 13 gentamicin-resistant strains, all of which were detected by macrotube, microtiter, and disk diffusion. microscan detected 2  (15%) of the 13. of the 18 streptomycin-resistant strains, 17 (93%) were detected by disk diffusion, 16 (89%) by microtiter, 9 (50%) by macrotube, and 6 (33%) by microscan. an additional 53 consecutive strains were examined only by disk diffusion and microtiter for resistance to gentamicin, streptomycin, and kanamycin. the entire population of 104 strains contained 35 gentamicin-, 22 streptomycin-, and 54 kanamycin-resistant enterococcal isolates. all 35 gentamicin-resistant strains were detected by both methods. of the 22 streptomycin-resistant strains, 1 was detected only by microtiter, 2 only by disk diffusion, and 19 by both methods. of the 54 kanamycin-resistant strains, 1 was detected only by microtiter, 2 only by disk diffusion, and 51 by both methods. one additional strain which was resistant only by disk diffusion was susceptible  to amikacin plus penicillin by time-kill studies. disk diffusion is a suitable method for detection of high-level aminoglycoside-aminocyclitol resistance in e.  faecalis and is well suited for sporadic testing. additional data are necessary to determine the suitability of these tests for e. faecium.

TI  == high-level resistance to gentamicin in clinical isolates of streptococcus (enterococcus) faecium.
AB  == during a 14-month period beginning in july 1986, three distinct clinical isolates of streptococcus (enterococcus) faecium demonstrating high-level resistance (mic, greater than 2,000 micrograms/ml) to gentamicin, kanamycin, tobramycin, and streptomycin were recovered from individual patients at one institution. combinations of ampicillin with any of these agents failed to show bactericidal synergism. by filter-mating techniques, high-level gentamicin resistance could be transferred into a susceptible recipient of the same species at frequencies as high as 1 x 10(-4); transfer into streptococcus faecalis jh2-7 occurred at lower  frequencies (less than 2 x 10(-7). aminoglycoside substrate profile analysis of clinical isolates as well as of laboratory-derived cured strains and transconjugants revealed 2"-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase and 3'-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (iii) phosphorylating enzymes, aac-6' acetylating activity above that attributable to the intrinsic activity characteristic of s. faecium, and a streptomycin adenylylating enzyme. all three  isolates carried a 51-megadalton plasmid. curing of this plasmid or conjugative transfer into susceptible recipients was associated with the loss or acquisition  of high-level gentamicin resistance, respectively. loss of high-level gentamicin  resistance was also observed when curing techniques resulted in a decrease in the size of this plasmid equivalent to a 10-megadalton deletion. transferable, high-level resistance to gentamicin and other aminoglycosides, which was previously recognized in s. faecalis, has now emerged in clinical isolates of s.  faecium, with the attendant concerns for possible spread.

TI  == novel streptococcal mutants defective in the regulation of h+-atpase biosynthesis and in f0 complex.
AB  == in streptococcus faecalis (faecium), the cytoplasmic ph is regulated by proton extrusion via a proton translocating f1f0-atpase; the level of this enzyme increases in response to cytoplasmic acidification (kobayashi, h., suzuki, t., and unemoto, t. (1986) j. biol. chem. 261, 627-630). we describe here two novel acid-sensitive mutants, designated as8 and as17, that contain atpase activity but fail to grow on acid media. our data suggested that in mutant as17, acidification of the cytoplasm stimulates synthesis of the f0 sector of the atpase but not the  f1 sector. the accumulation in the plasma membrane of f0 sectors devoid of f1 results in enhanced proton permeability, and as a consequence mutant as17 is unable to regulate the cytoplasmic ph in acid media. the genetic defect may reside in a gene that regulates expression of the f1f0-atpase. mutant as8 does not generate a proton motive force. our results suggest that the f1f0-atpase can  hydrolyze atp but fails to translocate protons due to a defect in one of the subunits of the f0 sector.

AB  == we have studied the in-vitro activity of erythromycin, vancomycin and pristinamycin against 1,006 clinical isolates comprising streptococci, staphylococci, neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae and anaerobes. in-vitro studies show pristinamycin to inhibit staphylococci and streptococci, including erythromycin highly-resistant organisms, at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l. although pristinamycin's mean mic for streptococci is higher than that of erythromycin, pristinamycin is bactericidal, whereas erythromycin is bacteristatic against streptococcus agalactiae and oral streptococci. enterococci were less uniformly susceptible to pristinamycin: 58 of the 94 enterococcus faecalis tested were resistant (mic greater than or equal to  3.12 mg/l). 14 of the 15 isolates of enterococcus faecium were inhibited by less  than or equal to 1.56 mg/l pristinamycin. pristinamycin showed poor activity against haemophilus influenzae (mode mic 1.56 and mic90 of 3.12 mg/l) but all except two of the 100 neisseria gonorrhoeae tested were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l pristinamycin. pristinamycin inhibited all nine clostridium spp. at less than or equal to 0.39 mg/l and 38 of 40 strains of anaerobic gram-positive cocci at less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l. it was less effective against the bacteroides fragilis group: (mic90 3.12 mg/l). pristinamycin had poor bactericidal activity against the anaerobes tested.

TI  == impact of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone on the bowel and vaginal flora after single-dose prophylaxis in vaginal hysterectomy.
AB  == the aim of this randomised controlled study was to investigate the effect of a preoperative, single dose, intravenous injection of ceftriaxone 2g and cefotaxime 2g in 2 groups of 30 patients who underwent vaginal hysterectomy. the parameters  were: efficacy and tolerance; impact on the aerobic bowel and vaginal flora; and  serum concentrations. there were no significant differences in efficacy, haematology or clinical chemistry parameters. in the ceftriaxone group 2 patients had exanthemas, 2 had diarrhoea. in the cefotaxime group no such side effects occurred. serum concentrations were 9.75 and 0.07 mg/l for ceftriaxone and cefotaxime, respectively, after 24 and 12 hours, respectively. ceftriaxone had a  pronounced and continuous effect on the bowel flora: streptococcus faecium and candida spp. increased, reaching counts of 10(8) and 10(7) organisms/g faeces, respectively, at day 10. under cefotaxime no dramatic alteration was determined and growth of candida spp. was not influenced. growth of escherichia coli and other bacteria of the vaginal flora was not influenced by either drug. overgrowth of candida spp. under ceftriaxone was significant (p less than 0.05) compared with that under cefotaxime. the results of this study indicate that the high biliary excretion of ceftriaxone (45%) and its long acting properties are responsible for the high selection pressure and overgrowth of candida. cefotaxime, a drug with low biliary excretion (5%) and shorter action, had only a negligible effect on the microflora with quick normalisation. the observed overgrowth of candida spp., even after a single injection of ceftriaxone, could cause problems when this drug is being used for surgical prophylaxis or treatment. this applies especially to immunocompromised patients.

AB  == identification and susceptibility studies were performed on 301 blood and urine streptococcus faecalis and streptococcus faecium isolates. strep trio-tubes s4, s5, and s3 (carr-scarborough microbiologicals, inc.) were compared with conventional methods for accuracy and rapidity. of 282 isolates identified as s.  faecalis, 98% were identified by species in 4 h with trio-tubes; the same percentage of isolates analyzed by conventional methods were identified in 24 h.  all 14 s. faecium isolates (approximately 5% of the total number of isolates) were identified by trio-tubes in 24 h. in vitro mic susceptibility testing of the isolates was performed by the dynatech 2000 microdilution technique (dynatech laboratories, inc.). several newly developed antimicrobial agents, including imipenem (a carbapenem) and some of the quinolone drugs, i.e., ci-934, ciprofloxacin, a-56619, a-56620, amifloxacin, norfloxacin, and enoxacin, were tested, as were ampicillin, erythromycin, and vancomycin. both ampicillin and vancomycin showed good activity against s. faecalis, with mics for 90% of isolates tested (mic90s) of 1 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively; with s. faecium, ampicillin exhibited an mic90 of 16 micrograms/ml and vancomycin exhibited an mic90 of 2 micrograms/ml. of the newer antimicrobial agents, imipenem and ci-934  exhibited the greatest activity against s. faecalis strains, with mic90s of 2 and 0.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. mbcs against the isolates were determined with ci-934, with 90% of s. faecalis strains showing mbcs of 1 microgram/ml or less.

TI  == intergeneric protoplast fusion between fusobacterium varium and enterococcus faecium for enhancing dehydrodivanillin degradation.
AB  == intergeneric protoplast fusion between fusobacterium varium (pcs glu+) and enterococcus faecium (pcr glu-) was performed under strictly anaerobic conditions to improve dehydrodivanillin (ddv) degradation. the fusion frequency obtained from the selective medium (pc+ glu-) was about 0.9 x 10(-5) to 1.3 x 10(-5). the  seven fusants isolated were all gram-negative anaerobes with rod shapes like that of f. varium and with main phenotypical properties of cocci like those of e. faecium such as esculin and starch hydrolysis, milk clotting, and lactate production. five fusants showed enhanced ddv degradation activities that were 2 to 4 times higher than those of parental strains. genetic relatedness between a fusant (fe7) and the parents was estimated by dna-dna southern blot hybridization with 32p-labeled chromosomal dna fragments of f. varium and e. faecium as respective probes. the fusant fe7 presented a very high cross-hybridization with  both probes, indicating a high dna homology between the fusant and both parental  strains. almost all the fusants obtained here have stably kept the properties described above for about 2 years. these results suggest that intergeneric gene transfer takes place through protoplast fusion and that the fusants that were obtained are stable recombinants.

TI  == penicillin-binding proteins in streptococcus faecalis and s. faecium.
AB  == penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of streptococcus faecalis nctc 775, s. faecium nctc 7171 and an isolate of s. faecium (strain 37) highly resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics were visualised by autoradiography. five pbps were detected in s. faecalis nctc 775 and six in s. faecium nctc 7171. additional pbps could not be found in the resistant isolate of s. faecium. the pbp affinities of  beta lactams were compared with mic values. the affinities of pbps 3 and 4 of s.  faecalis nctc 775 for penicillin g, ampicillin, cefathiamidine, cephaloridine and cephazolin were related to the sensitivity of the strain to these antibiotics as  were the affinities of pbps 4 and 5 in each s. faecium strain for the beta lactams. it is postulated that pbps 3 and 4 of s. faecalis nctc 775 and pbps 4 and 5 of s. faecium are the relevant target enzymes of the test antibiotics. pbps 4 and 5 of the highly beta-lactam-resistant s. faecium strain 37 showed proportionally low affinities for the five beta lactams compared to that of the less resistant strain s. faecium nctc 7171. decreased affinities of pbps 4 and 5  may account for the resistance in s. faecium strain 37 to beta lactams. the affinities for pbp 1, 2 and 5 in s. faecalis nctc 775 and pbps 1, 2, 3 and 6 in s. faecium were not related to the antibiotic sensitivities.

TI  == biotyping, serotyping and phage typing of streptococcus faecalis isolated from dental plaque in the human mouth.
AB  == thirty streptococcus faecalis isolates from mixed dental plaque samples were classified into four groups on the basis of biotype, tetracycline susceptibility, phage type and serotype combinations. the organisms were from patients on haemodialysis, from staff of the dialysis unit, and from controls. three biotypes were distinguished by seven biochemical tests: production of acid from inositol,  sucrose and xylose; rapid or delayed production of acid from sorbitol; gelatin liquefaction; and production of alkaline phosphatase and beta-galactosidase. with a set of eight typing antisera for s. faecalis, 15 strains were non-typable, 12 were serotype 1 and three were serotype 19. with a set of 17 bacteriophages specific for s. faecalis, all of the oral isolates were typable; 40% were lysotype i1 and the remainder lysotype v6b. on the basis of biotype-serotype-phage-type combinations, indications of possible spread of strains between haemodialysis patients and dialysis unit staff were obtained. biotyping and serotyping of 13 german isolates of s. faecalis of phage type i1 from four clinical sources and tripartite typing of three control strains provided additional evidence for the potential of biotyping in distinguishing between strains of identical serotype and phage type. one oral isolate of s. faecium was of phage type xx. none of the oral isolates of s. faecalis, of which  14 exhibited delayed sorbitol fermentation, reacted with group-g streptococcal grouping reagents or antiserum. slow sorbitol fermentation does not appear to be  a definitive phenotypic marker for s. faecalis strains possessing antigens that react with both group-d and group-g grouping reagents.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of ly146032 (daptomycin) against gram-positive cocci.

AB  == the in vitro activity of the new lipopeptide antibiotic ly146032 was generally four-fold greater (mic 90 less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml) than that of vancomycin against methicillin-susceptible or methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative species of staphylococcus. enterococci, streptococcus bovis, group b and viridans streptococci, and corynebacterium group j-k isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml of ly146032, which represented activity equivalent to or greater than that of vancomycin. unlike vancomycin, ly146032 was bactericidal for enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and listeria monocytogenes. due to its bactericidal properties ly146032 appeared to represent an improvement over vancomycin and teicoplanin.

AB  == plasmids coding for chloramphenicol resistance, five isolated from streptococci of groups a, b, and g, ten from enterococci (enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus  faecium), and two from staphylococci, were tested for sequence homology with the  chloramphenicol resistance gene of pip501, a 30-kb plasmid originally isolated from a group b streptococcus. the 6.3-kb hindiii fragment of pip501, known to carry the chloramphenicol resistance gene, was cloned into pbr322. a 1.6-kb portion of the cloned fragment, which included most of the chloramphenicol resistance gene, was used as probe in dna-dna hybridization experiments. sequence homology was detected between the probe and four of the streptococcal, seven of the enterococcal, and one of the staphylococcal plasmids. the absence of hybridization between this probe and one plasmid isolated from a group b streptococcus, as well as three isolated from e. faecalis, indicated that there are at least two different plasmid-borne chloramphenicol resistance determinants  in the streptococci and in the enterococci.

TI  == protoplast formation and regeneration of dehydrodivanillin-degrading strains of fusobacterium varium and enterococcus faecium.
AB  == two strains of rumen anaerobes isolated from dehydrodivanillin-degrading cultures were identified as fusobacterium varium and enterococcus faecium. these organisms degraded dehydrodivanillin synergistically to 5-carboxymethylvanillin and vanillic acid. specific conditions for protoplast formation and cell wall regeneration for both bacteria were determined, under strictly anaerobic conditions, to be as follows. the cell wall of each bacterium in yeast extract medium was loosened by adding penicillin g during early log-phase growth. the cell wall of f. varium was lysed by lysozyme (1 mg/ml) in glycerol (0.2 m)-phosphate buffer (0.05 m; ph 7.0). the addition of nacl (0.08 m) with lysozyme was necessary for lysis of e. faecium in this solution. almost all cells were converted to protoplasts after 2 h of incubation at 37 degrees c. regeneration of both protoplasts was 20 to 30% on an agar-containing yeast extract medium.

TI  == bactericidal activity of netilmicin compared with gentamicin and streptomycin, alone and in combination with penicillin, against penicillin tolerant viridans streptococci and enterococci.
AB  == netilmicin was compared with gentamicin and streptomycin for in-vitro activity against 30 strains of penicillin-tolerant streptococci including 16 strains of enterococci. both netilmicin and gentamicin tested alone at 4 mg/l caused 99.9% kill of more than half of the 13 strains of viridans streptococci tested, whereas streptomycin, 4 mg/l, had no bactericidal effect against these strains. netilmicin, gentamicin and streptomycin tested alone at 8.0 mg/l against 10 strains of streptococcus faecalis resulted in 99.9% kill of six, one and zero strains respectively. combinations of penicillin with 2 mg/l of either netilmicin or gentamicin resulted in bactericidal synergy against 12 of 13 strains of viridans streptococci and all 10 strains of s. faecalis after 18 to 24 h incubation. parallel experiments showed that higher concentration of penicillin were required to obtain 99.9% kill of 10 streptococcal strains when 4 mg/l streptomycin was compared with 2 mg/l of the other aminoglycosides. killing curves showed similar bactericidal synergy for netilmicin-penicillin and gentamicin-penicillin combinations against most streptococci tested after 24 h incubation but there was sometimes a greater bactericidal effect noted with netilmicin after only 6 h incubation of the broth or after 48 h incubation. the results of this in-vitro study suggest that netilmicin is at least as effective as gentamicin as a bactericidal synergic agent with penicillin against penicillin-tolerant viridans streptococci and s. faecalis strains isolated from patients with endocarditis. neither gentamicin or netilmicin were effective as bactericidal synergic agents with penicillin against 4 of 6 strains of s. faecium tested.

TI  == transferable resistance and aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes in enterococci.
AB  == ten isolates of streptococcus faecalis and two isolates of s. faecium were studied together with an nctc strain of each species. antibiotic susceptibility tests showed different patterns of high-level resistance to aminoglycosides. three s. faecalis strains were highly resistant to gentamicin and other aminoglycosides. by means of a filter membrane technique, transfer of high-level  resistance to aminoglycosides was demonstrated from s. faecalis to s. faecalis, from s. faecium to s. faecalis and from s. faecalis to s. faecium, the last of which has not previously been described. aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes were assayed with radiolabelled cofactors. high-level resistance to gentamicin and other aminoglycosides could be attributed to the production of 2''-o-phosphotransferases, 3'-o-phosphotransferases, 6-o-adenylyltransferases and 6'-n-acetyltransferases. other resistance mechanisms accounted for resistance in  two strains of s. faecalis and one strain of s. faecium that were highly resistant only to streptomycin and one s. faecalis strain that was moderately resistant to all aminoglycosides. a low level of 6'-n-acetyltransferases was detected in the three strains of s. faecium but this did not confer high-level resistance to aminoglycosides and this trait could not be transferred.

AB  == three benzylpenicillin-resistant, clinical isolates of enterococcus faecium (mic  values 16-64 micrograms ml-1) contained six penicillin-binding proteins (pbps), of which pbp5 was the most abundant and had the lowest affinity for the antibiotic. four benzylpenicillin-susceptible strains (mic values 0.031-0.5 microgram ml-1) were obtained as spontaneous derivatives from these above organisms. there were significant decreases in the amounts of pbp5 in each of the derivatives, with the concomitant appearance of a new, higher affinity pbp (5*) in three strains. increased amounts of pbp5, with no changes in pbp5*, were found in several mutants with intermediate-level benzylpenicillin-resistance (mic values 1-8 micrograms ml-1) selected from two of the susceptible strains. examination of 18 other clinical isolates, with a wide range of susceptibilities  to benzylpenicillin (mic values 0.062-128 micrograms ml-1), showed that pbp5* was present in 13 strains, and pbp5 in all of them, but in differing amounts. the results concerning the relative amounts and relative affinities of pbps 5* and 5  allowed the categorization of the various strains into six groups, within which organisms had somewhat similar susceptibilities to benzylpenicillin.

AB  == the recent literature was reviewed with regard to the risks of superinfection following beta-lactam chemotherapy. the summary publications for the pseudomonas-active penicillins (azlocillin, carbenicillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin and ticarcillin), cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, imipenem and moxalactam show marked variations. moxalactam was most likely to produce both gram-negative (5-38%) and enterococcal (2.2-12%) superinfections. ceftazidime or  moxalactam therapy was more often associated with anaerobic superinfections, usually by clostridium spp., than the other beta-lactams. comparable and lower incidences of superinfections were cited for cefoperazone, ceftazidime, mezlocillin and imipenem. the most common pathogens for the above drugs were the  fungi (candida spp.), pseudomonas spp. and some beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae. staphylococcal, escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. secondary infections were more common in patients receiving the newer penicillins. cefotaxime had a very low incidence of superinfections (1.1%), especially caused by gram-positive organisms such as enterococci. the reasons for this favorable feature seem to be: excellent inhibitory activity and beta-lactamase stability against a wide variety of bacterial pathogens, synergistic interactions of cefotaxime and its desacetyl metabolite, enhanced anti-enterococcal activity of cefotaxime in the presence of a human serum factor  and interactions of cefotaxime and desacetyl cefotaxime to suppress the development of antimicrobial resistance. the most common superinfections following cefotaxime treatment were with pseudomonas spp., enterobacter spp. and  fungi. cefotaxime appears to possess physical-chemical characteristics that react favorably with bacteria and the host to minimize gram-positive superinfections, especially with most enteric streptococcus spp. (streptococcus faecalis and streptococcus faecium).

TI  == interaction of anti-kojibiose antibody with the lipoteichoic acids from streptococcus faecalis and streptococcus faecium.
AB  == antisera prepared in rabbits by immunization with p-aminophenyl beta-kojibioside  conjugated to bovine serum albumin (antikojibiose sera), readily agglutinated whole cells of streptococcus faecalis or streptococcus faecium, and showed specific reactions with the lipoteichoic acids (ltas) of these streptococci by passive hemagglutination, microscale enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and crossed immunoelectrophoresis. the interaction of the antikojibiose sera with the ltas was inhibited best by kojibiose [alpha-d-glucopyranosyl-(1----2)-d-glucose], somewhat less by the dextran from which the kojibiose was prepared, and not measurably by maltose [alpha-d-glucopyranosyl-(1----4)-d-glucose]. the sera reacted only minimally in only the most sensitive assay (microscale enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) with lta from group a streptococci (this lta contains a single kojibiosyl residue as part of the glycolipid moiety of the molecule and failed to react with the lactobacillus fermentum lta which is substituted with alpha-d-galactopyranosyl-(1----2)-d -glucosyl units.

TI  == rutin-induced beta-glucosidase activity in streptococcus faecium vgh-1 and streptococcus sp. strain frp-17 isolated from human feces: formation of the mutagen, quercetin, from rutin.
AB  == a fecal isolate, streptococcus sp. strain frp-17, and strain vgh-1 of streptococcus faecium were shown to contain beta-glucosidases which converted rutin (quercetin-3-o-beta-d-glucose-alpha-l-rhamnose) to quercetin and were active against o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucose. the activity against rutin could be  measured by increased mutagenicity in the ames assay or visualized on thin-layer  chromatography plates. in both organisms, the beta-glucosidase activities were inducible by the addition of rutin to the growth media. several closely related strains of streptococcus spp. lacked any beta-glucosidase activity. in cell preparations of the active organisms, activities with rutin and o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucose were optimal at ph 6.8 and could be enhanced by increasing the ionic strength of the assay system. at low ionic strengths, both quercetin and a new product (intermediate between the polarities of rutin and quercetin) were formed by the incubation of rutin with cell preparations of either active organism. this product disappeared with increased ionic strength, suggesting that it may be a reaction intermediate, quercetin-3-o-beta-d-glucose.  these results suggest that the beta-glucosidase active against rutin and that active against o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucose are the same.

TI  == enumeration and speciation of group d streptococci from above and below a sewer outfall, their susceptibilities to six antibiotics and a comparison with clinical isolates.
AB  == isolates of group d streptococci from above and below a sewer outfall and a series of clinical isolates have been speciated to sub-species level. from below  the sewer outfall, streptococcus faecalis var. faecalis predominates whereas above the outfall, s. faecium var. casseliflavus predominates. s. faecalis var. faecalis, s. faecalis var. liquefaciens and s. faecalis var. zymogenes were the predominant sub-species in the clinical isolates where s. faecium var. casseliflavus was virtually absent. s. faecalis var. liquefaciens and s. faecalis var. zymogenes were uncommon in the environmental isolates. s. faecium and s. durans were more abundant in the environmental than in the clinical isolates. the use of group d streptococci as indicators of faecal pollution would seem more suited to higher, rather than lower, levels of pollution. a statistically significant increase in resistance to antibiotics (ampicillin, penicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline) was seen in isolates from below the outfall compared with those from above and a further significant increase was seen in the clinical isolates compared with the former. resistance to tetracycline was most common and ampicillin was the only antibiotic tested to  which no resistance was detected. multiple antibiotic resistance was rare in the  environmental isolates. even in moderately polluted water, there is not a large pool of antibiotic resistance.

TI  == medium-dependent zone size discrepancies associated with susceptibility testing of group d streptococci against various cephalosporins.
AB  == mueller-hinton (mh) agar media from various commercial sources, either supplemented or not supplemented with 5% sheep blood, were studied to determine their effect on disk diffusion susceptibility testing results obtained with 90 strains of group d streptococci and four cephalosporins. the cephalosporins investigated included cephalothin, cefamandole, moxalactam, and cefotaxime. results showed that a number of streptococcus faecalis and streptococcus faecium  strains were susceptible to cephalothin, cefamandole, and cefotaxime, but the number varied with both the commercial source and blood content of the mh medium  used. regardless of the mh medium used, none of the s. faecalis or s. faecium strains were found to be susceptible to moxalactam. the apparently medium-associated variations in the number of strains susceptible to cephalothin, cefamandole, and cefotaxime were largely due to minor discrepancies (one result being intermediate) among the various types of mh media used. however, major discrepancies (one result being resistant and the other susceptible or vice versa) were observed when s. faecalis strains were tested against cefotaxime. these major discrepancies were associated with both the commercial source of the  mh medium and the blood content of the medium.

TI  == identification of a streptococcal penicillin-binding protein that reacts very slowly with penicillin.
AB  == penicillin-binding protein (pbp) 5 of streptococcus faecium atcc 9790 has an unusually low affinity for penicillin (50% binding occurred at a penicillin level of 8 micrograms/ml after 60 min of incubation, and the protein only became labeled after 20 min of incubation with high concentrations of radioactive penicillin). pbps with similar properties are carried by strains of streptococcus durans, streptococcus faecalis, and streptococcus lactis but not by strains of groups a, b, c, and g streptococci or streptococcus pneumoniae. the strains carrying the slow-reacting pbp demonstrated a sensitivity to penicillin that was  several hundred times lower than that of strains not carrying it. spontaneous mutants with minimal inhibitory concentrations of penicillin of 20, 40, and 80 micrograms/ml were isolated from s. faecium atcc 9790. they all showed a dramatic increase in the amount of slow-reacting pbp produced. mutants with increased penicillin resistance were also isolated from wild-type strains of s. durans, s.  faecalis, and s. faecium. all of them carried a greater amount of the slow-reacting pbp than that carried by the parent. finally, it was found that resistant s. faecium atcc 9790 mutants grew normally in the presence of penicillin concentrations that were far above that saturating all pbps except pbp 5. cell growth was, on the contrary, inhibited by a penicillin concentration that saturated the slow-reacting pbp by 90%. this penicillin dose was equal to the minimal inhibitory concentration.

TI  == folate analogues. 22. synthesis and biological evaluation of two analogues of dihydrofolic acid possessing a 7,8-dihydro-8-oxapterin ring system.
AB  == two analogues of dihydrofolic acid possessing a 7,8-dihydro-8-oxapterin ring system have been synthesized and evaluated for their antifolate activities. these compounds, n-[(2-amino-4-hydroxy-7,8-dihydro-8-oxa-6-pteridinyl)benzoyl]-l-glutamic acid (3) and n-[[(2-amino-4-hydroxy-7,8-dihydro-8-oxa-6-pteridinyl) methyl]benzoyl]-l-glutamic acid (4), were synthesized by reacting the appropriately substituted alpha-halo ketones with 2,5-diamino-4,6-dihydroxypyrimidine (2). elaboration of p-carbomethoxybenzaldehyde (5) to p-carbomethoxyphenacyl bromide (7) was accomplished by its oxidation with jones reagent and the successive treatment of  the oxidation product with socl2, ch2n2, and hbr. commercially available p-vinylbenzoic acid (11) was converted to its glutamate conjugate 12 and was further converted to the bromo ketone, diethyl n-[p-(1-bromo-2-oxopropyl)benzoyl]-l-glutamate (17), by a series of reactions involving epoxidation, oxirane ring opening with hbr, jones oxidation, zn/hoac reduction, and successive treatment of the reduction product 16 with socl2, ch2n2, and hbr. these bromo ketones, 7 and 17, upon reaction with pyrimidine 2, gave the diethyl esters of the target compounds, which were hydrolyzed to 3 and 4 with naoh. compound 4 underwent an interesting acid-catalyzed isomerization where the double bond of 4 was shifted from the 5,6-position to the 6,9-position to give the isomer 19. both compounds 3 and 4 were inactive against lactobacillus casei (atcc 7469) and did not serve as synthetic substrates of l. casei dihydrofolate reductase. compound 4 showed activity against streptococcus faecium (atcc 8043), but 3 was inactive against this organism.

AB  == the in-vitro activity of cefathiamidine against streptococcus faecalis and str. faecium were studied in comparison with other beta-lactams. all the 56 strains of str. faecalis tested were inhibited by 2 mg/l of cefathiamidine. mics of ampicillin were twofold higher than those of cefathiamidine and mics of cephaloridine and cephazolin were 8-16-fold higher. no significant inoculum effect on mics of cefathiamidine could be seen. two isolates of str. faecium showed resistance to the four antibiotics. the mbcs of cefathiamidine and ampicillin for ten strains of str. faecalis showed that the ratios of mbc/mic were greater than 64. the rates of killing of str. faecalis were reduced at concentrations of cefathiamidine and ampicillin greater than the mic. the most rapid killing was obtained at 2 mg/l cefathiamidine or 4 mg/l of ampicillin. with the addition of 1 mg/l gentamicin this paradoxical bacteriocidal effect was eliminated. time killing studies showed 99.9% of the cells were killed within 6 h by a combination of aminoglycoside and beta-lactam. the paradoxical bacteriocidal effect of cefathiamidine and ampicillin was also demonstrated on solid media.

TI  == studies on the mechanism of intrinsic resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in group d streptococci.
AB  == six penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) were detected in clinical isolates of each one of three group d streptococci: streptococcus bovis, s. faecalis and s. faecium. when examined in whole organisms, the pbps of s. faecium, the most penicillin-resistant species of group d streptococci, generally had lower affinities for the antibiotic than those of s. faecalis (intermediate penicillin  resistance), which in turn were of lower affinity than those of s. bovis (penicillin-sensitive). on the other hand, no quantitative correlation could be established between the binding of penicillin to any one pbp or group of pbps, and the penicillin mic value for the corresponding micro-organism. examination of the amounts of antibiotic bound and the rates of binding to pbps of equal numbers of protoplasts and whole bacteria of s. faecalis and s. faecium, indicated that there was no permeability barrier to benzylpenicillin in the cell walls of these  species. the lower antibacterial effectiveness of cephalothin compared with ampicillin in group d streptococci was paralleled by the higher concentrations of cephalothin needed in competition assays to inhibit the lower molecular size pbps of these bacteria.

AB  == phosphatidylkojibiosyl diacylglycerol functions as the acceptor of sn-glycerol 1-phosphate moieties from phosphatidylglycerol in the in vitro synthesis of the membrane lipoteichoic acid of streptococcus faecium (s. faecalis atcc 9790). the  enzyme catalyzing this polymer-forming reaction is membrane-bound. the majority of the product is water-soluble, is excluded from sepharose 6b, and, after longer incubations, changes to a form that co-precipitates with protein upon exposure to a denaturing agent. these properties are shared by the polyglycerol phosphate-containing membrane lipoteichoic acid isolated from whole cells of s. faecium. however, unlike the lipoteichoic acid generated in vivo, the glycerol phosphate polymer portion of the product synthesized in vitro is not substituted  and, therefore, is considered a nascent lipoteichoic acid intermediate.

TI  == survival of faecal streptococci in raw and pasteurised egg products.
AB  == 1. the ability of streptococcus faecalis and streptococcus faecium strains to survive in egg albumen and liquid whole egg before and after laboratory pasteurisation was studied. 2. pasteurisation of egg albumen caused a decrease in viable cells of less than 10-fold, while pasteurisation of whole egg caused decreases of more than 100-fold in only two of the eight strains studied. after growth in whole egg, some strains were more resistant to pasteurisation in whole  egg. 3. strep. faecalis multiplied in raw and pasteurised whole egg but not in egg albumen. 4. strep. faecium multiplied in raw and pasteurised whole egg only after an initial decline in viability which was not shown by cells adapted to whole egg. together with storage temperature this affected the number of viable cells after a storage period of 5 d. 5. in raw and pasteurised egg albumen strep. faecium strains lost viability; this was maximal at 37 degrees c and more cells survived as the storage temperature decreased.

AB  == combinations of penicillin with various aminoglycosidic aminocyclitols were tested against a collection of clinical isolates of streptococcus faecium in vitro and were used to treat endocarditis caused by s. faecium in the rabbit model. s. faecium proved more resistant to penicillin than streptococcus faecalis. even more striking, however, was the resistance to in vitro synergism by combinations of penicillin and various aminoglycosides. at clinically achievable concentrations, penicillin-gentamicin was the only combination that was synergistic against all strains that were tested. combinations of penicillin  and streptomycin and penicillin and amikacin were synergistic only against those  strains that were not highly resistant to streptomycin and kanamycin, respectively. combinations of penicillin with kanamycin, tobramycin, sisomicin, or netilmicin failed to produce synergism against any of these strains. the possible clinical significance of these findings was verified by use of the rabbit model of endocarditis. combinations of penicillin with gentamicin or streptomycin were synergistic in the therapy of endocarditis that was produced by a strain of s. faecium that did not have a high level of resistance to aminoglycosides. however, the combination of penicillin and netilmicin was no more effective than penicillin alone.

TI  == release of autolytic enzyme from streptococcus, faecium cell walls by treatment with dilute alkali.
AB  == the autolytic enzyme (endo-beta-1,4-n-acetylmuramoylhydrolase) of streptococcus faecium (s. faecalis atcc 9790) was released in a soluble form from insoluble cell wall-autolytic enzyme complexes by treatment with dilute naoh at 0 degree c. treatment of cell wall-enzyme complexes, obtained from either exponential- or stationary-phase cells, with 0.008 to 0.01 n naoh gave maximum yields of autolytic enzyme activity. at a fixed concentration of naoh, the yield of autolysin increased with increasing wall densities and was accompanied by the release of methylpentose and phosphorus in amounts proportional to the autolysin. since extraction of wall-enzyme complexes with 4.5 m licl at 0 degree c also removed methylpentose and phosphorus, release of enzyme with naoh did not appear  to result from hydrolysis of covalent linkages. the autolytic enzyme activity released from intact cells, or cell walls, was predominantly in the later (proteinase activable) form which could be activated by trypsin or a proteinase present in commerical bovine plasma albumin.

TI  == relationship between cellular autolytic activity, peptidoglycan synthesis, septation, and the cell cycle in synchronized populations of streptococcus faecium.
AB  == synchronized, slowly growing (td = 70 to 80 min) cultures were used to study several wall-associated parameters during the cell cycle: rate of peptidoglycan synthesis, septation, and cellular autolytic activity. the rate of peptidoglycan  synthesis per cell declined during most of the period of chromosome replication (c), but increased during the latter part of c and into the period between chromosome termination and cell division (d). an increase in cellular septation was correlated with the increased rate of peptidoglycan synthesis. cellular autolytic capacity increased during the early portion of c, reached a maximum late in c or early in d, and declined during d. inhibition of dna synthesis during c prevented the decline in autolytic capacity at the end of the cell cycle, caused a slight reduction in the rate of peptidoglycan synthesis, delayed  but did not prevent septation, and prevented the impending cell division by inhibiting cell separation. inhibition of dna synthesis during d did not prevent  the increase in autolytic capacity during the next c phase, but, once again, prevented the decline at the end of the subsequent cycle. thus, increased autolytic capacity at the beginning of the cell cycle did not seem to be related  to chromosome initiation, whereas decreased autolytic capacity at the end of the  cell cycle seemed to be related to chromosome termination. the data presented are consistent with the role of autolytic enzyme activity in the previously proposed  model for cell division of s. faecium (g.d. shockman et al., ann. n.y acad. sci.  235:161-197, 1974).

TI  == plasmid-mediated mechanisms of resistance to aminoglycoside-aminocyclitol antibiotics and to chloramphenicol in group d streptococci.
AB  == genes conferring resistance to aminoglycoside-aminocyclitol antibiotics in three  group d streptococcal strains, streptococcus faecalis jh1 and jh6 and s. faecium  jh7, and to chloramphenicol in jh6 are carried by plasmids that can transfer to other s. faecalis cells. the aminoglycoside resistance is mediated by constitutively synthesized phosphotransferase enzymes that have substrate profiles very similar to those of aminoglycoside phosphotransferases found in gram-negative bacteria. phosphorylation probably occurs at the aminoglycoside 3'-hydroxyl group. plasmid-borne streptomycin resistance is due to production of  the enzyme streptomycin adenylyltransferase, which, as in staphylococci and in contrast to that detected in gram-negative bacteria, is less effective against spectinomycin as substrate. resistance to chloramphenicol is by enzymatic acetylation. the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase is inducible and bears a close resemblance to the type d chloramphenicol acetyltransferase variant from staphylococci.

TI  == cellular autolytic activity in synchronized populations of streptococcus faecium.
AB  == the autolytic capacity of streptococcus faecium (s. faecalis atcc 9790) varied during synchronous cell division. this phenomenon was initially observed in rapidly dividing populations (td=30 to 33 min) synchronized by a combination of induction and size selection techniques. to minimize the problems inherent in studies of cells containing overlapping chromosome cycles and possible artifacts  generated by induction techniques, the autolytic capacities of slowly dividing populations (td=60 to 110 min) synchronized by selection only were examined. although the overall level of cellular autolytic capacity was observed to decline with decreasing growth rate, sharp, periodic fluctuations in cellular autolytic capacity were seen during synchronous growth at all growth rates examined. on the basis of similar patterns of cyclic fluctuations in autolytic capacity of cultures synchronized by (i) selection, (ii) amino acid starvation followed by size selection, and (iii) amino acid starvation followed by inhibition of dna synthesis, a link of such fluctuations with the cell division cycle has been postulated.

TI  == generation rates of faecal streptococci in various vehicles.
AB  == potassium tellurite media gave the highest detrimental effects on the generation  number of all tested faecal streptococci species. this applies to all investigated vehicles. however, drastic tellurite effects became more conspicuous with certain vehicles than with others. this is particularly true with acid and alkaline foods and water, especially with strains like streptococcus bovis, str.  faecium, and str. durans. again, tellurite becomes more influencial with regard to old cells rather than young cells in the logarithmic phase. on the other hand, the use of thallous acetate as a concentration agent secured better results than  either the tellurite or azide almost with all tested vehicles. yet, sodium azide  may be regarded as holding an intermediate position between tellurite and thallous acetate in terms of vehicles, streptococcus species, and age of pollution. a lower number of generation resulted with all tested faecal streptococci species, using liquid media bearing more than one concentrating agent. this applied to water and milk examination.

TI  == phage typing scheme for group d streptococci isolated from human urogenital tract.
AB  == streptococci of lancefield group d were isolated from 52.2% of pharyngeal, 55.5%  of urethral, 56.6% of endocervical, and 75.4% of ano-rectal specimens. seventeen  phages isolated from sewage and urogenital specimens were selected for phage typing. four of these lysed only the strains of streptococcus faecalis and its variety liquefaciens. another six phages lysed only the strains of streptococcus  faecium and its variety durans. with the help of seven bacteriophages, 346 of 384 (90.1%) strains of s. faecalis and its variety liquefaciens could be classified into 27 types. similarly, with the help of 10 other bacteriophages, 97 of 117 (82.9%) strains of s. faecium and its variety durans could be grouped into 22 types. in 72 of 87 (82.7%) cases, similar phage types were obtained at different  culture sites of the same individual.

TI  == methotrexate analogs. 6. replacement of glutamic acid by various amino acid esters and amines.
AB  == a series of methotrexate (mtx) analogs was prepared in which the glutamic acid moiety is replaced by various amino acid esters and amines. the synthetic method  consisted of the reaction of 4-amino-4-deoxy-n10-methylpteroic acid with various  reagents to form intermediate mixed anhydrides, which then reacted with amino acid esters or amines to give the mtx analogs. these compounds were tested for antibacterial activity against streptococcus faecium and for antitumor activity against l1210 leukemia in mice. several compounds showed significant antibacterial activity; the mtx homocysteinethiolactone and mtx aspartate analogs showed marginal in vivo antitumor activity.

TI  == synthesis and excretion of glycerol teichoic acid during growth of two streptococcal species.
AB  == examination of both supernatant culture medium and cell pellets after exponential- and stationary-phase growth of streptococcus mutans strain fa-1 and  streptococcus faecalis atcc 9790 (s. faecium) showed the presence of [-3h]glycerol-labeled material that possessed several of the properties of glycerol teichoic acid. in the supernatant medium of s. mutans fa-1, an apparently large-molecular-size material, which eluted from agarose columns with  the kd value expected of a lipoteichoic acid, was observed. large amounts of this material were present in supernatants during the stationary phase. in contrast, with s. faecalis only an apparently lower-molecular-weight form, with a kd consistent with deacylated glycerol teichoic acid, was found in the growth medium. both organisms had high-molecular-weight lipoteichoic acid in the cells along with the deacylated glycerol teichoic acid. the presence of relatively large amounts of glycerol teichoic acids in the medium was considered to be a result of excretion of these compounds rather than a result of cellular lysis.

TI  == membrane filter technique for enumeration of enterococci in marine waters.
AB  == a membrane filter procedure is described for the enumeration of enterococci in marine waters. the procedure utilizes a highly selective and somewhat differential primary isolation medium followed by an in situ substrate test for identifying colonies of those organisms capable of hydrolyzing esculin. the procedure (me) was evaluated with known streptococci strains and field samples with regard to its accuracy, sensitivity, selectivity, precision, and comparability to existing methods. essentially quantitative recovery was obtained with seawater-stressed cells of streptococcus faecalis and s. faecium. neither s. bovis, s. equinus, s. mitis, nor s. salivarius grew on the medium. the selectivity of the medium was such that a 10,000-fold reduction in background organisms was obtained relative to a medium which contained no inhibitors and was incubated at 35 c. about 90% of those typical colonies designated as enterococci  confirmed as such and about 12% of the colonies not so designated were, in fact,  identified as enterococci. plate to plate variability across samples approximated that expected by chance alone. verified recoveries of enterococci from natural samples by the me procedure, on the average, exceeded those by the kf method by one order of magnitude.

TI  == phosphatidylkojibiosyl diglyceride: metabolism and function as an anchor in bacterial cell membrane.
AB  == the recently discovered phosphoglycolipid, phosphatidylkojibiosyl diglyceride (pkd), was first observed as a biosynthetic by-product of glycosyl diglyceride metabolism in streptococcus faecalis (faecium) atcc 9790. its structure is 1, 2-diacyl-3-o-alpha-dglucopyranosyl-6'-o-phosphoryl- [1'', 2''-diacyl-3''-o-sn-glycerol]-alpha-d-glucopyranosyl)-sn-glycerol. the biosynthesis of phosphatidyl-kojibiosyl diglyceride occurs by a novel transphosphatidylation reaction in which a phosphatidyl glycerol to the primary alcohol function at the 6 position of the internal glucose of kojibiosyl diglyceride. the reaction is catalyzed by a membrane-derived enzyme. phosphatidyl-kojibiosyl diglyceride is bound covalently through a phosphodiester  bond to the polyglycerol phosphate moiety of membrane lipoteichoic acid from s. faecalis. phosphatidylkojibiosyl diglyceride has four nonpolar long chain fatty acyl groups and appears to have the necessary physico-chemical properties to anchor the long hydrophilic glycerol phosphate polymer of lipoteichoic acid to the hydrophobic enviroment of the membrane of s. faecalis and probably other gram-positive bacteria as well.

AB  == dihydrofolate reductase from the amethopterin-resistant mutant (strain a) of streptococcus faecium var. durans was reacted with iodo[14c]acetate according to  three procedures; (a) in the absence of an inhibitor, (b) in the presence of aminopterin, and (c) in absence of inhibitor, but after treatment with unlabeled  iodoacetate in presence of aminopterin. the first and last procedures resulted in the loss of approximately 90% of the catalytic activity, whereas in the presence  of aminopterin essentially no activity was lost. peptides were produced from all  three labeled proteins by tryptic digestion after citraconylation of the lysine residues. from the amino acid compositions and partial amino acid sequences of these peptides the position of all modified methionines in the sequence was determined. the extent of labeling at each methionine, in enzyme labeled in the different procedures, indicated that methionines 28 and 50 may be at the binding  site for inhibitors and that residue 50 is less accessible to iodoacetate than is residue 28. it is likely that carboxymethylation of residue 28 is responsible for the loss of enzyme activity.

TI  == purification and characterization of two bacteriocins from streptococcus faecium.
AB  == two bacteriocins were found in the supernatant fluid and in an extract of streptococcus faecium strain ei. the small soluble enterocin eia represented more than 90% of the total activity in the supernatant fluid, and was purified 400-fold by ammonium sulphate fractionation, gel filtration on sephadex g-75 and  chromatography on deae-cellulose. enterocin eib, with a particle weight greater than 4 x 10(6), was the predominant type in the extract. it was released in appreciable quantities after breakage of the bacteria and was purified 100-fold by differential centrifugation, chromatography on sepharose 4b and density gradient ultracentrifugation. enterocin eia, a basic substance with a molecular weight of about 10000, was resistant to heat and was attacked by trypsin, whereas enterocin eib was less thermostable and insensitive to proteolytic enzymes. the activity of enterocin eib was unchanged by treatment with dnaase. sensitivity to  enterocin action was confined to certain strains of various enterococcus species, streptococcus salivarius and listeria monocytogenes; all the other gram-positive  and gram-negative bacteria tested for sensitivity were unaffected by either enterocin.

AB  == compound 21 (n10-methyl-4-thiofolic acid) and related compounds were prepared as  potential inhibitors of the cofactor forms of tetrahydrofolate. the preparation of 2-acetylamino-4-(benzylthio)-6-chloro-5-nitropyrimidine (4) provided an intermediate that was allowed to react with methyl p-[(3-aminoacetonyl)methylamino]benzoate oxime (16). the oxime function of the resulting 6-substituted aminopyrimidine 6 was hydrolyzed to give the corresponding acetonylaminopyrimidine 7, which on reductive cyclization gave methyl p-[[[2-amino-4-(benzylthio)-7,8-dihydro-6-pteridinyl]methyl]methylamino]benzoate  (9). this dihydropteridine was oxidized with potassium permanganate, and the product was treated successively with sodium hydrosulfide to replace the benzylthio group and with aqueous sodium hydroxide to hydrolyze the ester function to give p-[[(2-amino-3,4-dihydro-4-thioxo-6-pteridinyl)methyl]methylamino]benzoic acid (n10-methyl-4-thiopteroic acid, 12). another route to 12 involved the interaction of 2,5-diamino-4,6-dichloropyrimidine (15) with 16 to give methyl p-[[(2-amino-4-chloro-7,8-dihydro-6-pteridinyl)methyl]methylamino]benzoate (13).  displacement of the chloro group of 13 with sodium hydrosulfide followed by the simultaneous air oxidation of the dihydropteridine ring and saponification of the ester group gave 12. after protection of the 2-amino and 4-thioxo moieties of 12, the resulting intermediate benzoic acid was coupled with diethyl l-glutamate. the product of this reaction was deblocked to give 21. methylation of 21 gave the corresponding 4-(methylthio) derivative 22, which on reaction with hydrazine gave the 4-hydrazino analog 23 of methotrexate. reduction of 12 and 21 with sodium hydrosulfite gave the dihydropteridines 24 and 25, respectively. the title compound was an excellent inhibitor of the growth of streptococcus faecium atcc 8043. however, this and related compounds were ineffective inhibitors of dihydrofolic reductase and showed no significant activity in either the kb cell culture screen or against l1210 leukemia cells in mice.

AB  == combinations of cephalothin and aminoglycoside antibiotics are not currently used in the therapy of serious enterococcal infections, because clinical trials of these combinations have been unsuccessful. studies of 28 enterococci isolated from patients with enterococcal bacteremia suggested three possible mechanisms for this in vivo antibiotic failure: (i) a relatively high level of resistance to cephalothin among all enterococci and especially those characterized as streptococcus faecium, (ii) a significant incidence of high-level resistance to the aminoglycosides among certain strains of enterococci, and (iii) a failure of  synergism to occur when cephalothin concentrations fall below the minimal inhibitory concentration of the enterococcus, as occurs during the in vivo metabolism and excretion of this antibiotic when given in standard doses for endocarditis.

TI  == phosphatidylkojibiosyl diglyceride. the covalently linked lipid constituent of the membrane lipoteichoic acid from streptococcus faecalis (faecium) atcc 9790.
AB  == water-soluble [14c]glycerol-labeled lipoteichoic acid isolated from the membrane  preparations of streptococcus faecalis (faecium) atcc 9790 released chloroform-soluble radioactivity upon mild acid hydrolysis. chromatography of the radioactive, chloroform-extractable material revealed the presence of a very polar lipid (lipid i). depending upon the conditions of acid hydrolysis, lipid i  accounted for as much as 92% of the total 14c-labeled lipids released. more stringent conditions of acid hydrolysis reduced the amount of lipid i and increased the quantity of the other lipids. lipid i on further mild acid hydrolysis yielded phosphatidylkojibiosyl diglyceride almost quantitively. the other lipids released from the lipoteichoic acid were kojibiosyl diglyceride, monoglucosyl diglyceride, monoglyceride, diglyceride, and phosphatidylmonoglucosyl diglyceride. these lipids are most likely the degradation products of phosphatidylkojibiosyl diglyceride because they are all simpler, structural derivatives of the phosphoglucolipid and they increase in concentration with increasing acid hydrolysis. these and other data demonstrate that the glycerol phosphate polymer of the membrane lipoteichoic acid of s. faecalis (faecium) atcc 9790 is covalently linked through a phosphodiester bond to phosphatidylkojibiosyl diglyceride.

AB  == the study was performed on 612 routine cultures of material obtained from root canals of teeth at the time of filling (r-cultures) by students at the department of endodontics during a continuous period of one year. twenty-nine isolates from  27 (29.3%) of the 92 positive cultures filled the criteria of enterococci (sherman, 1937) and had demonstrable group d-antigen. with a set of tests these isolates were identified as follows: strep. faecalis subsp. faecalis (10), strep. faecalis subsp. zymogenes (3), strep. faecalis subsp. liquefaciens (8), atypical  variants of strep. faecalis (6), strep. faecium var. faecium (1) and strep. faecium var. durans (1). five tests in the present study clearly differentiated strep. faecalis from strep. faecium i.e. fermentation of sorbitol, glycerol (anaerobic) and melezitose, tolerance to potassium tellurite (0.1%) (positive for strep. faecalis) and production of hydrogen peroxide (positive for strep. faecium). in the inocula 10(3) or more colony forming units of enterococci were found more often of other identified microorganisms. this means that enterococci  are of special interest in studies on the influence of infection at the time of filling of root canals on the prognosis of root canal therapy. the isolates were  also tested for susceptibility to azidocillin, ampicillin, penicillin-g, penicillin-v and erythromycin with the paper disc method. all the isolates were susceptible to azidocillin and ampicillin (sensitivity group i), while the majority of the isolates showed a lower susceptibility to the other three antibiotics (sensitivity group ii). the significance of these findings in the choice of prophylactic antibiotic to prevent bacterial endocarditis in patients with a history of rheumatic or congenital heart disease are discussed, when bacteremia from dental procedures may be expected.

TI  == growth of streptococcus faecium in the presence of lysozyme.
AB  == streptococcus faecium can grow normally in the presence of lysozyme, despite the  observation that cell suspensions of the organism are lysed readily by the enzyme. growth in the presence of lysozyme is not due to resistant cells, and the culture is lysed after growth if the ph of the medium is not allowed to drop too  low for lysozyme activity. growth followed by lysis in the presence of lysozyme was not exhibited by other organisms tested which were either significantly more  resistant or more sensitive to lysozyme than s. faecium. lysozyme was active on the cell wall of s. faecium during growth in the presence of 200 mug of the enzyme per ml in a complex medium. it appears that, when actively metabolizing, s. faecium can synthesize the cell wall at a greater rate than lysozyme can hydrolyze it. thus, the organism is capable of growth in the presence of the enzyme. a large variation in the lytic responses of enterococcal cell suspensions to lysozyme was dependent on the strain used, the growth phase from which the culture was harvested, and the medium in which the culture was grown.

TI  == induction of enterococcal l-forms by the action of lysozyme.
AB  == suspensions of enterococci were treated with lysozyme in the presence of osmotic  stabilizers. the resulting osmotically fragile bodies prepared from streptococcus faecium strain f24 and s. faecalis strain e1 gave rise to l-forms under optimal osmotic and nutritional conditions for treatment and subsequent growth. the most  critical component of the growth medium, to obtain maximum yields, was the nature and concentration of the added salt. the two most effective salts were sodium chloride and ammonium chloride in the range of 2 to 3% (w/v) added to a suitable  agar base. ammonium chloride was more versatile, because it could be used with either sucrose or polyethylene glycol 4000 as the osmotic stabilizer for preparation and dilution of the osmotically fragile bodies. sodium chloride would not consistently support growth of s. faecium f24 as l-forms when polyethylene glycol 4000 was used as the osmotic stabilizer during lysozyme treatment. time-course studies of concurrent cell wall removal and l-form induction suggested that maximal induction required only cell wall damage rather than complete wall removal. this method for induction of l-forms from a suspension of  enterococci is a significant improvement over other presently known methods.

AB  == strains of streptococcus faecalis and s. faecium are known to produce ammonia from arginine, but only s. faecalis couples the adenosine triphosphate (atp) produced through the arginine dihydrolase pathway to growth processes. the specific activities of the arginine dihydrolase enzymes were found to be much lower in s. faecium (0.01 to 0.10) than in s. faecalis (0.24 to 1.60). phosphatase activities in both strains were similar (up to 0.11), but equaled or  exceeded the activities of the arginine dihydrolase enzymes in s. faecium. the failure of s. faecium to show increased growth in arginine media is explained on  the basis of low activities of the arginine dihydrolase enzymes coupled with sufficient phosphatase activity to negate any benefit from atp formed.

TI  == group q streptococci. ii. nutritional characteristics and growth relationship to  thymine, folate, and folinate.
AB  == the vitamin requirements of the group q streptococci (streptococcus avium) and the established enterococcal species (s. faecalis and s. faecium) paralleled one  another, although s. avium did not characteristically require riboflavine or pyridoxal. s. avium was further differentiated in that it required thymine for growth initiation whether or not folate was present. folate was stimulatory in the presence of sub-optimal concentrations of thymine, as well as during the early growth period with optimal thymine concentrations. folinate completely replaced the thymine requirement, and the s. avium strains required significantly higher concentrations than did pediococcus cerevisiae 8081. the requirement pattern for folate and related compounds was compared, and marked differences were observed in the requirements of s. faecalis, s. faecium, s. avium, and p. cerevisiae.

TI  == effect of lactic acid bacteria on growth of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == cultures of lactic acid bacteria, mostly from foods, were tested for their effect on the growth of staphylococcus aureus in trypticase soy broth (bbl). some of the effectors, e.g., streptococcus faecalis, s. faecium, lactobacillus lactis, l. brevis, and leuconostoc mesenteroides, stimulated growth of s. aureus during early hours of growth, especially at higher temperatures of incubation, but most  cultures were inhibitory, and some (s. faecium and l. mesenteroides) were even killing by the time of attainment of the maximal phase of growth of the staphylococcus. low-temperature meat lactobacilli and leuconostoc dextranicum inhibited s. aureus at 10, 15, 20, and 25 c throughout its growth. streptococcus  faecalis var. liquefaciens inhibited at these temperatures and at 30 and 37 c, as well. when the ratio of effectors to staphylococci in the inoculum was 100:1, the three enterococci, the meat lactobacillus, and l. dextranicum prevented the attainment of 5 x 10(6) staphylococci per milliliter at 15 c, and all but the meat lactobacillus did so at 22 c. a ratio of 1:1 accomplished similar results at 15 c, except that s. aureus was only delayed for 12 hr by s. faecalis. a ratio of 1:100 usually was ineffective. in general, the more effector bacteria there were  in the inoculum, the greater was the overall inhibition (or stimulation) of s. aureus. inhibition was most effective at 10 or 15 c, less so at 20 or 25 c, and least at 30 or 37 c, whereas stimulation during early growth was greater at the higher temperatures. results with different strains of the effectors and with two strains of s. aureus were similar, for the most part.

(indiana university, bloomington). host range of certain virulent and temperate bacteriophages attacking group d streptococci. j. bacteriol. 88:165-171. 1964.-host range studies with five bacteriophages isolated from sewage showed that a high degree of strain specificity occurred among the species streptococcus faecalis, s. faecalis var. zymogenes, and s. faecalis var.  liquefaciens. certain phages were able to attack various members of these subgroups but not other members. a high degree of strain specificity was also found with respect to eight phages attacking strains of s. faecium. many strains  of this latter group were resistant to all the phages available. the only firm conclusion was that no phage attacked both s. faecium and s. faecalis strains. in several selected strains of the s. faecalis-liquefaciens-zymogenes group, resistance to several virulent phages seemed to be related to the presence of certain prophages in these strains. a search for transduction with the temperate  phages was unsuccessful. mutants of s. faecium 8043 resistant to certain growth-factor analogues showed unpredictable changes in resistance and sensitivity to two virulent phages.

TI  == occurrence of enterococci on plants in a wild environment.
AB  == enterococci were obtained from 14% of nearly 2,200 flowers, 3.4% of non-floral structures of angiosperms, and from 8.3% of samples of soil, water, and lesser plants of the great smoky mountains national park, an area little influenced by the presence of man. the enterococci were recovered from one or more flowers or flower clusters of 1,515 samples in 47 taxa, but not from flowers of 67 taxa with 654 samples. the per cent of recovery was influenced adversely by dense forest cover and by increase in elevation, as compared with recovery from flowers in sunny locations in the lower elevations. the per cent recovery increased directly with rising seasonal temperature, with the maximal per cent of recovery occurring in september. in no instance did all samples of a species of flower or plant yield enterococci on culture, and with only three genera, cacalia, delphinium, and mitchella, were the bacteria obtained from more than 50% of the samples. approximately 11% of the cultures isolated were identified as streptococcus faecalis, 64% as the soft curd producing, caseolytic variant of s. faecalis, 4% as s. faecalis var. zymogenes, and 20% as s. faecium. the per cent distribution of these species on plants was reasonably similar to the distribution within wild animals in the same environment. it was concluded that the enterococci occurring  on plants arise commonly from the wild animals, and that they do not represent plant-specific species or variants of the enterococci.
