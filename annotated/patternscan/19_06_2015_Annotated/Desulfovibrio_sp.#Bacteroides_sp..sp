TI  == phylogenetic analysis of tce-dechlorinating consortia enriched on a variety of electron donors.
AB  == two rapidly fermented electron donors, lactate and methanol, and two slowly fermented electron donors, propionate and butyrate, were selected for enrichment  studies to evaluate the characteristics of anaerobic microbial consortia that reductively dechlorinate tce to ethene. each electron donor enrichment subculture demonstrated the ability to dechlorinate tce to ethene through several serial transfers. microbial community analyses based upon 16s rdna, including terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) and clone library/sequencing, were performed to assess major changes in microbial community structure associated with electron donors capable of stimulating reductive dechlorination.  results demonstrated that five phylogenic subgroups or genera of bacteria were present in all consortia, including dehalococcoides sp., low g+c gram-positives (mostly clostridium and eubacterium sp.), bacteroides sp., citrobacter sp., and delta proteobacteria (mostly desulfovibrio sp.). phylogenetic association indicates that only minor shifts in the microbial community structure occurred between the four alternate electron donor enrichments and the parent consortium.  inconsistent detection of dehalococcoides spp. in clone libraries and t-rflp of enrichment subcultures was resolved using quantitative polymerase chain reaction  (q-pcr). q-pcr with primers specific to dehalococcoides 16s rdna resulted in positive detection of this species in all enrichments. our results suggest that tce-dechlorinating consortia can be stably maintained on a variety of electron donors and that quantities of dehalococcoides cells detected with dehalococcoides specific 16s rdna primer/probe sets do not necessarily correlate well with solvent degradation rates.

TI  == metabolism of polyethylene glycol by two anaerobic bacteria, desulfovibrio desulfuricans and a bacteroides sp.
AB  == two anaerobic bacteria were isolated from polyethylene glycol (peg)-degrading, methanogenic, enrichment cultures obtained from a municipal sludge digester. one  isolate, identified as desulfovibrio desulfuricans (strain dg2), metabolized oligomers ranging from ethylene glycol (eg) to tetraethylene glycol. the other isolate, identified as a bacteroides sp. (strain pg1), metabolized diethylene glycol and polymers of peg up to an average molecular mass of 20,000 g/mol [peg 20000; ho-(ch2-ch2-o-)nh]. both strains produced acetaldehyde as an intermediate, with acetate, ethanol, and hydrogen as end products. in coculture with a methanobacterium sp., the end products were acetate and methane. polypropylene glycol [ho-(ch2-ch2-ch2-o-)nh] was not metabolized by either bacterium, and methanogenic enrichments could not be obtained on this substrate. cell extracts of both bacteria dehydrogenated eg, pegs up to peg 400 in size, acetaldehyde, and other mono- and dihydroxylated compounds. extracts of bacteroides strain pg1 could not dehydrogenate long polymers of peg (greater than or equal to 1,000 g/mol), but the bacterium grew with peg 1000 or peg 20000 as a substrate and therefore possesses a mechanism for peg depolymerization not present in cell extracts. in contrast, extracts of d. desulfuricans dg2 dehydrogenated long polymers of peg, but whole cells did not grow with these polymers as substrates.  this indicated that the bacterium could not convert peg to a product suitable for uptake.
