TI  == isolation of bacteroides from fish and human fecal samples for identification of  unique molecular markers.
AB  == bacteroides molecular markers have been used to identify human fecal contamination in natural waters, but recent work in our laboratory confirmed cross-amplification of several human-specific bacteroides spp. assays with fecal  dna from fish. for identification of unique molecular markers, bacteroides from human (n = 4) and fish (n = 7) fecal samples were cultured and their identities were further confirmed using rapid id 32a api strips. the 16s rdna from multiple  isolates from each sample was pcr amplified, cloned, and sequenced to identify unique markers for development of more stringent human-specific assays. in human  feces, bacteroides vulgatus was the dominant species (75% of isolates), whereas in tilapia feces, bacteroides eggerthii was dominant (66%). bacteroides from grass carp, channel catfish, and blue catfish may include bacteroides uniformis,  bacteroides ovatus, or bacteroides stercoris. phylogenic analyses of the 16s rrna gene sequences showed distinct bacteroides groupings from each fish species, while human sequences clustered with known b. vulgatus. none of the fish isolates showed significant similarity to bacteroides sequences currently deposited in ncbi (national center for biotechnology information). this study expands the current sequence database of cultured fish bacteroides. such data are essential for identification of unique molecular markers in human bacteroides that can be utilized in differentiating fish and human fecal contamination in water samples.

TI  == application of quantitative real-time pcr for rapid identification of bacteroides fragilis group and related organisms in human wound samples.
AB  == our goal was to establish a quantitative real-time pcr (qrt-pcr) method to detect bacteroides fragilis group and related organisms from clinical specimens. compared to conventional anaerobic culture, qrt-pcr can provide accurate and more rapid detection and identification of b. fragilis group and similar species. b. fragilis group and related organisms are the most frequently isolated anaerobic pathogens from clinical samples. however, culture and phenotypic identification is quite time-consuming. we designed specific primers and probes based on the 16s rrna gene sequences of bacteroides caccae, bacteroides eggerthii, b. fragilis, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides stercoris, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis, bacteroides vulgatus, odoribacter splanchnicus (bacteroides splanchnicus), parabacteroides distasonis (bacteroides distasonis) and parabacteroides merdae (bacteroides merdae), and detected these species by means of qrt-pcr in 400 human surgical wound infection samples or closed abscesses. the target bacteria were detected from 31 samples (8%) by culture, but from 132 samples (33%) by qrt-pcr (p-value < 0.001). b. uniformis was the most common species (44 positive samples) according to qrt-pcr while culture showed it to be b. fragilis (16 positive samples). additionally, for each species qrt-pcr detected higher counts than culture did; this may reflect detecting dna of dead organisms by qrt-pcr. qrt-pcr is a rapid and sensitive method which has great potential for detection of b. fragilis group and related organisms in wound samples.

TI  == [bacteroides fragilis group in non-diarrheal human feces and its antimicrobial susceptibility].
AB  == bacteroides is a predominant anaerobic bacteria of the human colon. since the ten species of the bacteroides fragilis group are responsible for most anaerobic endogenous infections, the antimicrobial resistance of these bacteria is of great concern due to the role they can play in the dissemination of resistance. eighty  non-diarrheic human feces samples were analyzed. each sample was inoculated in bbe (bacteroides bile esculin) and kvlb (kanamycin, vancomycin, laked blood) agar plates and were incubated in anaerobic conditions for 48 h at 35 degrees c. for identification and antimicrobial sensitivity, miniaturized systems for anaerobic  bacteria (rapid id-32a and atb ana, biomerieux) were used. sixty-four (80%) of the samples were positive for at least one bacteroides fragilis species; b. uniformis and b. fragilis were the most frequent species (24.6% and 16.9%); b. stercoris and b. eggerthii were the least frequent (0.7 and 2.1%). the strains showed resistance to different penicillins (40.2-93.1%), some even in the presence of beta-lactamase inhibitors, to cephalosporins (31.0-52.1%) and to frequently used antibiotics against anaerobes, such as clindamycin (32.2%) and imipenem (10.3%). the most effective antimicrobials against bacteroides fragilis  were piperacillin and ticarcillin combined with beta-lactamase inhibitors, as well as chloramphenicol and metronidazole (>90% susceptibility). none of the b. fragilis group were resistant to clindamycin or metronidazole, but one-third of the imipenem-resistant strains belonged to this species. the most resistant species was b. distasonis, while b. vulgatus was the most susceptible. none of the tested antimicrobials were effective against all ten species; the majority of the species had some isolates that were resistant to imipenem, metronidazole or clindamycin. this resistance pattern suggests the presence of efficient transmission mechanisms among these endogenous bacteria.

TI  == bacteroides barnesiae sp. nov., bacteroides salanitronis sp. nov. and bacteroides gallinarum sp. nov., isolated from chicken caecum.
AB  == eight bacterial strains isolated from the caecum of chicken, bl2(t), bl66, eg3, eg6, m27, bl78(t), c35(t) and c43, were characterized by determining their phenotypic characteristics, cellular fatty acid profiles, menaquinone profiles and phylogenetic positions based on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis showed that these isolates belonged to the genus bacteroides. one group of five strains (bl2(t), bl66, eg3, eg6 and m27) was related most closely to bacteroides coprocola jcm 12979(t), with approximately 93 % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity, and to bacteroides plebeius jcm 12973(t), with about 92 % similarity, and shared >or=99.6 % similarity with each other. strain bl78(t) exhibited 90.5 % similarity to b. plebeius jcm 12973(t) and 89.8 % similarity to b. coprocola jcm 12979(t) and differed from the above group of five strains at >or=10 % sequence divergence. strains c35(t) and c43 were related most closely to bacteroides eggerthii jcm 12986(t), with 95.1 % sequence similarity, to bacteroides stercoris jcm 9496(t), with 94.6 % similarity, and to bacteroides  uniformis jcm 5828(t), with 94.4 % similarity, and shared 100 % similarity with each other. from results of phenotypic examination, cellular fatty acid composition analysis, menaquinone composition analysis and dna g+c contents, the  group of five strains as well as strain bl78(t) were shown to differ from the type strains of b. coprocola and b. plebeius. strain bl78(t) differed from the others based on its menaquinone composition, which included mk-11 and mk-12. strains c35(t) and c43 could also be differentiated from the type strains of b. eggerthii, b. stercoris and b. uniformis. the group of five strains, strain bl78(t), b. coprocola jcm 12979(t) and b. plebeius jcm 12973(t) showed low levels of dna-dna relatedness (<35 %) with each other. high levels of dna-dna relatedness were obtained within the group of five strains (>75 %). strains c35(t) and c43 exhibited a high level of dna-dna relatedness (>88 %) with each other, but low levels with b. eggerthii jcm 12986(t) (<40 %), b. stercoris jcm 9496(t) (<37 %) and b. uniformis jcm 5828(t) (<16 %). on the basis of these data, three novel bacteroides species are proposed: bacteroides barnesiae sp. nov. (type strain bl2(t)=jcm 13652(t)=dsm 18169(t)), bacteroides salanitronis sp. nov. (type strain bl78(t)=jcm 13657(t)=dsm 18170(t)) and bacteroides gallinarum sp. nov. (type strain c35(t)=jcm 13658(t)=dsm 18171(t)).

TI  == [esbl-positive strains of the bacteroides fragilis group isolated from patients at the regional hospital center in plock (poland)].
AB  == the aim of this study was to confirm a presumptive qualification of clinical b. fragilis group strains isolated in plock as esbl-positive strains and to determine some properties of these strains. twenty four clinical strains belonging to the b. fragilis group, isolated first of all from surgical patients, were received for testing. identification of strains was performed in the automatic atb expression system (biomerieux sa, france) using biochemical api 20  a strips. strains were tested for the production of catalase (id color catalase test, biomerieux sa) and beta-lactamase (cefinase, bbl, becton dickinson, usa). susceptibility of strains to four antimicrobial agents: clindamycin, metronidazole, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and imipenem was determined by etest (ab biodisk, sweden). esbls were detected with the use of two disc diffusion methods: the double-disc synergy test (ddst) according to jarlier et al. and the  diagnostic disc (dd) test according to appleton. seventeen of examined strains belonged to the species bacteroides fragilis, three--to b. ovatus/thetaiotaomicron, two--to b. distasonis, one--to b. uniformis and one--to  b. stercoris/eggerthii. one strain (b. uniformis) did not produce catalase, whereas all strains produced beta-lactamases. examined strains were susceptible in vitro to metronidazole, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and imipenem. one clindamycin-resistant strain was detected (b. fragilis). occurrence of esbl-type  enzymes was confirmed in 22 strains of following species: b. fragilis (17 strains), b. ovatus/thetaiotaomicron (3), b. distasonis (1) and b. uniformis (1). clinical strains of the b. fragilis group with a new mechanism of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics appeared during last years in poland. they produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), so they are resistant to penicillins,  cephalosporins and monobactams. monitoring of infections caused by these threatening strains in hospital patients is very important.

TI  == rapid identification of the species of the bacteroides fragilis group by multiplex pcr assays using group- and species-specific primers.
AB  == we report a rapid and reliable two-step multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay to identify the 10 bacteroides fragilis group species - bacteroides caccae, b. distasonis, b. eggerthii, b. fragilis, b. merdae, b. ovatus, b. stercoris, b.  thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis and b. vulgatus. these 10 species were first divided into three subgroups by multiplex pcr-g, followed by three multiplex pcr  assays with three species-specific primer mixtures for identification to the species level. the primers were designed from nucleotide sequences of the 16s rrna, the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and part of the 23s rrna gene. the established two-step multiplex pcr identification scheme was applied to the identification of 155 clinical isolates of the b. fragilis group that were previously identified to the species level by phenotypic tests. the new scheme was more accurate than phenotypic identification, which was accurate only 84.5% of the time. the multiplex pcr scheme established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of the b. fragilis group species. this will permit more accurate assessment of the role of various b. fragilis group members in infections and of the degree of antimicrobial resistance in each of the group members.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin (sb 265805) against anaerobes.
AB  == gemifloxacin mesylate (sb 265805), a new fluoronaphthyridone, was tested against  359 recent clinical anaerobic isolates by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards reference agar dilution method with supplemented brucella blood agar and an inoculum of 10(5) cfu/spot. comparative antimicrobials tested included trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, sparfloxacin, sitafloxacin (du-6859a), penicillin g, amoxicillin clavulanate, imipenem, cefoxitin, clindamycin, and metronidazole. the mic(50) and mic(90) (mics at which 50 and 90% of the isolates were inhibited) of gemifloxacin against various organisms (with the number of strains tested in parentheses) were as follows (in micrograms per milliliter): for bacteroides fragilis (28), 0.5 and 2; for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (24), 1 and 16; for bacteroides caccae (12), 1 and 16; for bacteroides distasonis (12), 8 and >16; for bacteroides ovatus (12), 4 and >16; for bacteroides stercoris (12), 0.5 and 0.5; for bacteroides uniformis (12), 1 and 4; for bacteroides vulgatus (11), 4 and 4; for clostridium clostridioforme (15), 0.5 and 0.5; for clostridium difficile (15), 1 and >16; for clostridium innocuum (13), 0.125 and 2; for clostridium perfringens (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for  clostridium ramosum (14), 0.25 and 8; for fusobacterium nucleatum (12), 0.125 and 0.25; for fusobacterium necrophorum (11), 0.25 and 0.5; for fusobacterium varium  (13), 0.5 and 1; for fusobacterium spp. (12), 1 and 2; for peptostreptococcus anaerobius (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (13), 0.125 and 0.125; for peptostreptococcus magnus (14), 0.03 and 0.03; for peptostreptococcus micros (12), 0.06 and 0.06; for peptostreptococcus prevotii (14), 0.06 and 0.25; for porphyromonas asaccharolytica (11), 0.125 and 0.125; for prevotella bivia (10), 8 and 16; for prevotella buccae (10), 2 and 2; for prevotella intermedia (10), 0.5 and 0.5; and for prevotella melaninogenica (11),  1 and 1. gemifloxacin mesylate (sb 265805) was 1 to 4 dilutions more active than  trovafloxacin against fusobacteria and peptostreptococci, and the two drugs were  equivalent against clostridia and p. asaccharolytica. gemifloxacin was equivalent to sitafloxacin (du 6859a) against peptostreptococci, c. perfringens, and c. ramosum, and sitafloxacin was 2 to 3 dilutions more active against fusobacteria.  sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, and levofloxacin were generally less active than gemifloxacin against all anaerobes.

TI  == evaluation of the rapid id 32a system for the identification of the bacteroides fragilis group.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the use of a rapid identification system, rapid id 32a (biomerieux), for the identification of clinically important species in the b. fragilis group. methods: the use of rapid id 32a was validated on 249 clinical isolates, all of which were tested by conventional techniques, and in selected instances api 20a. rapid id 32a (and api 20a as appropriate) was then applied in  a central laboratory to the identification of 1289 b. fragilis group clinical isolates from 22 laboratories in 15 european countries. results: improvements in  the initial database permitted the accurate identification of isolates of b. fragilis, b. thetaiotaomicron and b. vulgatus, but further tests, especially for  catalase production, were required to distinguish between b. ovatus and b. uniformis, while an identification of b. distasonis could be accepted only after  careful review of results. there were too few isolates of b. caccae, b. merdae and b. stercoris for us to reach satisfactory conclusions, but further tests are  clearly necessary. conclusions: the study emphasizes the importance of including  sufficient numbers of isolates of different species in the validation of identification methods. rapid id 32a is a reliable system for the identification  of the common species in the b. fragilis group, especially b. fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron.

TI  == sphingolipid composition in bacteroides species.
AB  == sphingolipid profiles of strains from species of genus bacteroides, and representative strains from prevotella and porphyromonas, were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography and infrared spectrophotometry. two major types of phosphosphingolipid, ceramide phosphorylethanolamine and ceramide phosphorylglycerol, were detected in b. fragilis, b. ovatus, b. uniformis, b. caccae, b. eggerthii, b. thetaiotaomicron, and b. stercoris, but not in b. merdae, b. distasonis, and b. vulgatus. strains from the genera prevotella and porphyromonas also contained these two sphingolipids. these sphingolipid profiles were conserved within the species tested, and may be useful for differentiation and recognition of relationships within the genera bacteroides, prevotella and porphyromonas.

TI  == electrophoretic analysis of the lipopolysaccharides of bacteroides spp.
AB  == lipopolysaccharide (lps) extracts of reference strains and isolates of bacteroides spp. prepared by the proteinase k method were resolved by tricine-sodium-dodecyl-sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and located by silver staining. a considerable diversity of lps profiles was evident within the  bacteroides genus although profiles were essentially species-specific, with some  minor interstrain variations apparent among isolates of b. uniformis, b. ovatus,  b. eggerthii and b. thetaiotaomicron. the lps of most species consisted of a major rough lps component of 2-5 kda and a series of higher molecular weight bands which varied with species. b. vulgatus lps was distinctive in showing an extensive ladder of multiple repeating oligosaccharide units with molecular weights ranging from 4 to > 17 kda b. stercoris lps included a high molecular weight (> 17 kda) ladder of repeating oligosaccharide units. b. fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron differed from most other species in producing a short ladder of  repeating oligosaccharide units interspersing the rough lps and a 5.6 kda (b. fragilis) or 9 kda (b. thetaiotaomicron) yellow-staining component. the heterogeneity of lps profiles within the bacteroides genus may reflect the differences in pathogenicity among the species and prove useful for typing.

TI  == rapid differentiation of the species of the genus bacteroides sensu stricto by capillary gas chromatography of cellular carbohydrates.
AB  == whole-cell hydrolysates of bacteroides fragilis, the type species of the genus bacteroides castellani and chalmers 1919, and the genetical closely related species b. vulgatus, b. ovatus, b. eggerthii, b. distasonis, b. uniformis, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. stercoris, b. merdae, and b. caccae were used to determine characteristic carbohydrate patterns by capillary gas chromatography. on the basis of the chemical derivatization of the carbohydrates seven characteristic peaks for peracetylated aldononitriles and nine characteristic peaks for peracetylated o-methyloximes were selected from the carbohydrate fingerprints of  the reference strains to prepare a dichotomous identification key. the classification of an unknown strain supposed to belong to the formerly called 'bacteroides fragilis group' is possible with this key. some of the advantages of the technique were that the identification of bacteroides fragilis-like strains requires only 4-5 h after primary isolation and that the bacteria can be exposed  to oxygen because viability of the organisms is not necessary. sophisticated anaerobic techniques can therefore be avoided for identification.

TI  == short prereduced anaerobically sterilized (pras) biochemical scheme for identification of clinical isolates of bile-resistant bacteroides species.
AB  == the rapid identification of isolates of bile-resistant bacteroides species has clinical and therapeutic relevance because of differences in their patterns of susceptibility and virulence. five hundred twenty-one strains of bile-resistant bacteroides species that were previously identified by conventional biochemical methods were reexamined to determine the minimum essential parameters necessary for correct identification. rapid tests for bile resistance, indole production, and catalase were combined with a novel scheme for biochemical determination of saccharolytic activity on arabinose, trehalose, rhamnose, and/or xylan that included the postincubation addition of bromthymol blue for visual ph determination. organisms were inoculated into prereduced anaerobically sterilized (pras) carbohydrates directly from plates, and identification was complete within 24 h of obtaining a pure culture. ninety-three percent of bile-resistant bacteroides species from routine clinical specimens were identified correctly by  this scheme; a small number of other indole-positive strains, b. splanchnicus, b. eggerthii, and b. stercoris, were misidentified as b. uniformis.

TI  == prevotella, a new genus to include bacteroides melaninogenicus and related species formerly classified in the genus bacteroides.
AB  == it was recently proposed that the genus bacteroides should be restricted to bacteroides fragilis (the type species) and closely related organisms (viz., b. caccae, b. distasonis, b. eggerthii, b. merdae, b. ovatus, b. stercoris, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis, and b. vulgatus). by contrast, the moderately saccharolytic, predominantly oral bacteroides species, which include b. melaninogenicus, b. oralis, and related species, form a phenotypically and phylogenetically coherent group of species which differ so significantly from the emended description of the genus bacteroides that they should not be classified in the same genus. therefore, we formally propose that these species be reclassified in a new genus, prevotella. the type species is prevotella melaninogenica.
