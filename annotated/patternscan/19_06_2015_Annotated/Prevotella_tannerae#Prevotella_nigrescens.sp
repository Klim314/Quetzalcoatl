TI  == saliva, supragingival biofilm and root canals can harbor gene associated with resistance to lactamic agents.
AB  == this study aimed to determine the presence of prevotella strains and genes associated with resistance to lactamics in different oral niches from patients with/without primary endodontic infections. saliva (s) and supragingival biofilm  (sb) were collected from three patient groups: group i - no endodontic infection  (n = 15); group ii - acute endodontic infection (n = 12); and group iii - chronic endodontic infection (n = 15). root canal (rc) samples were collected from groups ii and iii. the presence of p. intermedia, p nigrescens, p. tannerae and cfxa/cfxa2 gene was assessed by pcr. the cfxa/cfxa2 gene was not detected in all  environments within the same patient. the cfxa/cfxa2 gene was present in 23.81% of s samples, 28.57% of sb samples, and 7.41% of rc samples. prevotella species were detected in 53.97%, 47.62% and 34.56% of the s, sb, and rc samples, respectively. p. intermedia had a high frequency in saliva samples from group 3.  saliva samples from group 1 had higher detection rates of p. nigrescens than did  groups 2 and 3. patients without endodontic disease had high frequencies of p. nigrescens in the sb samples. the presence or absence of spontaneous symptoms was not related to the detection rates for resistance genes in the rc samples. saliva, supragingival biofilm and root canals can harbor resistant bacteria. the  presence of symptomatology did not increase the presence of the cfxa/cfxa2 gene in the supragingival biofilm and inside root canals.

TI  == an investigation of the presence of specific anaerobic species in necrotic primary teeth.
AB  == different microbial identification methods have shown that the microbial community profiles in endodontic infections are diverse and assorted. the aim of  this study was to evaluate the frequency of selected endodontic pathogens in the  pulp chambers (pcs) and root canals (rcs) of infected primary teeth using pcr methods. paired pc and rc samples were collected from 15 subjects and analyzed by pcr for the presence of filifactor alocis, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella tannerae, tanerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and treponema socranskii. the frequency of each species was  determined in the pc and rc of each case. the species most frequently detected in pcs were p. nigrescens (86.7%), p. gingivalis (73.3%), and f. alocis (73.3%). of  the pc samples, 13.3% contained p. micra and t. denticola, and 6.7% contained t.  forsythia. the species most frequently detected in rcs were p. gingivalis (100%)  and p. nigrescens (93.3%). p. tannerae, p. micra, and t. denticola were found in  40% of the rc samples; t. forsythia was found in 26.7% of the rc samples. the "red complex", which comprises p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia, was not found in the pc of any tooth but was found in 30% of the rc samples. the detection of p. nigrescens in the pc was statistically associated with the presence of p. nigrescens in the rc (p = 0.04). the results suggest high heterogeneity among the samples, even among those from the same subject.

TI  == microbiologic profile of endodontic infections from hiv- and hiv+ patients using  multiple-displacement amplification and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == objective: to compare the microbiota of endodontic infections in necrotic pulp from hiv-negative and hiv-positive subjects. materials and methods: root canal samples from necrotic pulp were collected from 40 hiv- and 20 hiv+ subjects. pulps were amplified using multiple displacement amplification (mda). then, checkerboard dna-dna hybridization was employed to assess the levels of 107 microbial taxa. the percentage of dna probe count and the percentage of teeth colonized by each test species were investigated. significant differences between groups regarding proportions of taxa and prevalence of the test species were sought using the mann-whitney test and the chi-square analysis, respectively. results: the most prevalent taxa detected were dialister pneumosintes, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, streptococcus sobrinus, corynebacterium diphteriae, and helicobacter pylori among hiv- subjects and d. pneumosintes, prevotella tannerae, porphyromonas gingivalis, parvimonas micra, prevotella nigrescens, and  corynebacterium diphtheriae among hiv+ individuals. d. pneumosintes, c. diphtheria, and c. albicans were the most abundant species in the hiv- group, whereas the predominant taxa in hiv+ samples were p. tannerae, d. pneumosintes and olsenella uli. p. tannerae, o. uli, veilonella dispar, bacteroides fragilis,  and actinomyces meyeri were significantly more abundant in hiv+ samples. conclusions: there were significant differences in the prevalence and proportions of specific microbial taxa between hiv- and hiv+ individuals. the root canal microbiota may represent a reservoir of important oral and medical pathogens, mainly in hiv+ individuals.

TI  == microbiota of deciduous endodontic infections analysed by mda and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the microbiota of endodontic infections in deciduous teeth by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization after uniform amplification of dna in samples  by multiple displacement amplification (mda). methodology: forty samples from the root canal system of deciduous teeth exhibiting pulp necrosis with or without radiographically detectable periradicular/interradicular bone resorption were collected and 32 were analysed, with three individuals contributing two samples;  these were mda-amplified and analysed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization for levels of 83 bacterial taxa. two outcome measures were used: the percentage of teeth colonized by each species and the mean proportion of each bacterial taxon present across all samples. results: the mean amount of dna in the samples prior  to amplification was 5.2 (+/-4.7) ng and 6.1 (+/-2.3) mug after mda. the mean number of species detected per sample was 19 (+/-4) (range: 3-66) to the nearest  whole number. the most prevalent taxa were prevotella intermedia (96.9%), neisseria mucosa (65.6%), prevotella nigrescens (56.2%) and tannerella forsythia  (56.2%). aggregatibacter (haemophilus) aphrophilus and helicobacter pylori were not detected. p. intermedia (10%), prevotella tannerae (7%) and prevotella nigrescens (4.3%) presented the highest mean proportions of the target species averaged across the positive samples. conclusion: root canals of infected deciduous teeth had a diverse bacterial population. prevotella sp. were commonly  found with p. intermedia, prevotella tannerae and prevotella nigrescens amongst the most prominent species detected.

TI  == multiplex polymerase chain reaction detection of black-pigmented bacteria in infections of endodontic origin.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to detect the presence of porphyromonas endodontalis, p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, p. nigrescens, and p. tannerae from clinical samples using multiplex polymerase chain reactions (pcr).  two different multiplex pcr protocols were used (one for the two porphyromonas species and the other for the three prevotella species), each one using a primer  pair specific for each target species. the results were compared to those of the  conventional culture procedures. microbial samples were taken aseptically from 40 infected root canals and abscesses from patients. samples were cultured in an anaerobic condition for conventional identification using a rapid id 32 a kit. multiplex pcr was processed using the dna extracted from each sample. at least one of the five species of black-pigmented bacteria (bpb) were detected in 65% (26 of 40) of the samples using multiplex pcr, and in 15% (6 of 40) using the conventional culture procedures. multiplex pcr was more rapid, sensitive, specific, and effective in detecting bpb than the conventional culture procedures.

TI  == geographical differences in bacteria detected in endodontic infections using polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) is an innovative nucleic acid-based assay that has the highest sensitivity of any microbiological technique for the detection of bacteria. the purpose of this study was to use pcr to detect the presence of specific species of bacteria in samples collected from two geographical locations. microbial samples from abscesses of endodontic origin were collected from patients in portland, oregon, and rio de janeiro, brazil. pcrs with species-specific oligonucleotide primers for the 16s ribosomal rna gene were used for detection of the bacteria after dna extraction from each clinical sample. statistical analysis revealed that there was a significant difference in  detection of the bacteria between the two geographical locations for prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella tannerae, fusobacterium nucleatum,  and porphyromonas gingivalis, but not for porphyromonas endodontalis, fusobacterium necrophorum, and enterococcus faecalis. these results suggest that  differences in bacteria detected or cultured in studies can be associated with geographical location.

TI  == recently described clinically important anaerobic bacteria: taxonomic aspects and update.
AB  == a new method of identifying bacteria, phylogenetic 16s rrna sequencing, has led to major reorganizations among most genera of anaerobic bacteria. the pigmented prevotella species now comprise seven species including p. nigrescens and p. tannerae; p. intermedia/p. nigrescens-like organisms await inclusion. the former  mitsuokella dentalis and hallella seregens were transferred to prevotella as one  species, p. dentalis. p. enoeca is a new nonpigmenting prevotella. the genus porphyromonas currently includes 11 pigmented species and one nonpigmented species, p. catoniae; p. levii-like and p. endodontalis-like organisms are candidates for the genus. fusobacterium nucleatum currently has five subspecies,  and f. varium includes the former f. pseudonecrophorum. former wolinella recta and wolinella curva now are campylobacter rectus and campylobacter curvus; campylobacter showae is a new species. isolates included in the bile-sensitive former bacteroides gracilis now are campylobacter gracilis; the bile-resistant b. gracilis isolates were transferred to a new genus, sutterella, as s. wadsworthensis. the new actinomyces species include two subspecies of the a. neuii and the a. radingae-a. turicensis complex. the genus eubacterium sensu stricto is represented by e. limosum, and the former e. alactolyticum was reclassified in a new genus, pseudoramibacter, as p. alactolyticus. recent entries include e. saphenum, e. minutum, e. exiguum, e. infirmum, and e. tardum.  a new genus, atopobium houses some former lactobacilli and streptococci. the genus peptostreptococcus also have four new species; p. hydrogenalis, p. lacrimalis, p. lactolyticus, and p. vaginalis.
