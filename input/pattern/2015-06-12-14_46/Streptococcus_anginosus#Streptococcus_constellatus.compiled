TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2010 and March 2011].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from April 2010 to March 2011 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 631 strains including 25 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 170 (81.7%) of 208 patients with surgical infections. Four hundred and twenty two strains were isolated from primary infections, and 184 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. such as Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus avium was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp. such as Streptococcus anginosus and Staphylococcus spp. such as Staphylococcus aureus, in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. such as E. faecalis and E. faecium was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. such as S. aureus from surgical site infection. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from surgical site infection, E. coli and R aeruginosa were most predominantly isolated, followed by E. cloacae and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rates of Parvimonas micra, Eggerthella lenta, Streptococcus constellatus, Gemella morbillorum, and Collinsella aerofaciens were the highest from primary infections, and the isolation rate from surgical site infection was generally low. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by, Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides ovatus, and from surgical site infection, B. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by Bacteroides thetaiotaomnicron, in this order. In this series, vancomycin-resistant MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa were not observed.
TI  - Development of species-specific quantitative real-time PCR primers for detecting  anginosus group streptococci based on the rpoB.
AB  - In this study, we introduced species-specific quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) primers designed based on a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase beta-subunit gene for detecting anginosus group streptococci (AGS), Streptococcus anginosus, S. constellatus, and S. intermedius. The specificity of the qPCR primers was confirmed by conventional PCR with the genomic DNAs of 76 strains regarding 44 bacterial species including the type strain for the target species. The standard curves revealed the lower detection limits of these species-specific qPCR primers was 40 fg at below a cycle threshold (CT) value of 35. These results suggest that AGS species-specific qPCR primers are suitable for applications in epidemiological studies associated with infectious diseases related to AGS.
TI  - Identification of the 'Streptococcus anginosus group' by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization--time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
AB  - Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) provides rapid, accurate and cost-effective identification of a range of bacteria and is rapidly changing the face of routine diagnostic microbiology. However, certain groups of bacteria, for example streptococci (in particular viridans or non-haemolytic streptococci), are less reliably identified by this method. We studied the performance of MALDI-TOF MS for identification of the 'Streptococcus anginosus group' (SAG) to species level. In total, 116 stored bacteraemia isolates identified by conventional methods as belonging to the SAG were analysed by MALDI-TOF MS. Partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing, supplemented with sialidase activity testing, was performed on all isolates to provide 'gold standard' identification against which to compare MALDI-TOF MS performance. Overall, 100 % of isolates were correctly identified to the genus level and 93.1 % to the species level by MALDI-TOF MS. However, only 77.6 % were correctly identified to the genus level and 59.5 % to the species level by a MALDI-TOF MS direct transfer method alone. Use of a rapid in situ extraction method significantly improved identification rates when compared with the direct transfer method (P<0.001). We recommend routine use of this method to reduce the number of time-consuming full extractions required for identification of this group of bacteria by MALDI-TOF MS in the routine diagnostic laboratory. Only 22 % (1/9) of Streptococcus intermedius isolates were reliably identified by MALDI-TOF MS to the species level, even after full extraction. MALDI-TOF MS reliably identifies S. anginosus and Streptococcus constellatus to the species level but does not reliably identify S. intermedius.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a novel secreted glycosidase with multiple glycosidase activities in Streptococcus intermedius.
AB  - Streptococcus intermedius is a known human pathogen and belongs to the anginosus  group (S. anginosus, S. intermedius, and S. constellatus) of streptococci (AGS). We found a large open reading frame (6,708 bp) in the lac operon, and bioinformatic analysis suggested that this gene encodes a novel glycosidase that can exhibit beta-d-galactosidase and N-acetyl-beta-d-hexosaminidase activities. We, therefore, named this protein "multisubstrate glycosidase A" (MsgA). To test whether MsgA has these glycosidase activities, the msgA gene was disrupted in S. intermedius. The msgA-deficient mutant no longer showed cell- and supernatant-associated beta-d-galactosidase, beta-d-fucosidase, N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase, and N-acetyl-beta-d-galactosaminidase activities, and all phenotypes were complemented in trans with a recombinant plasmid carrying msgA. Purified MsgA had all four of these glycosidase activities and exhibited the lowest Km with 4-methylumbelliferyl-linked N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminide and the highest kcat with 4-methylumbelliferyl-linked beta-d-galactopyranoside. In addition, the purified LacZ domain of MsgA had beta-d-galactosidase and beta-d-fucosidase activities, and the GH20 domain exhibited both N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase and N-acetyl-beta-d-galactosaminidase activities. The beta-d-galactosidase and beta-d-fucosidase activities of MsgA are thermolabile, and the optimal temperature of the reaction was 40 degrees C, whereas almost all enzymatic activities disappeared at 49 degrees C. The optimal temperatures for the N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase and N-acetyl-beta-d-galactosaminidase activities were 58 and 55 degrees C, respectively. The requirement of sialidase treatment to remove sialic acid residues of the glycan branch end for glycan degradation by MsgA on human alpha1-antitrypsin indicates that MsgA has exoglycosidase activities. MsgA and sialidase might have an important function in the production and utilization of monosaccharides from oligosaccharides, such as glycans for survival in a normal habitat and for pathogenicity of S. intermedius.
TI  - Molecular pathogenicity of Streptococcus anginosus.
AB  - Streptococcus anginosus and the closely related species Streptococcus constellatus and Streptococcus intermedius, are primarily commensals of the mucosa. The true pathogenic potential of this group has been under-recognized for a long time because of difficulties in correct species identification as well as the commensal nature of these species. In recent years, streptococci of the S. anginosus group have been increasingly found as relevant microbial pathogens in abscesses and blood cultures and they play a pathogenic role in cystic fibrosis. Several international studies have shown a surprisingly high frequency of infections caused by the S. anginosus group. Recent studies and a genome-wide comparative analysis suggested the presence of multiple putative virulence factors that are well-known from other streptococcal species. However, very little is known about the molecular basis of pathogenicity in these bacteria. This review summarizes our current knowledge of pathogenicity factors and their regulation in S. anginosus.
TI  - An unusual case of Streptococcus anginosus group pyomyositis diagnosed using direct 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing.
AB  - Bacteria belonging to the Streptococcus anginosus group (Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus constellatus and Streptococcus anginosus) are capable of causing serious pyogenic infections, with a tendency for abscess formation. The present article reports a case of S anginosus group pyomyositis in a 47-year-old man. The pathogen was recovered from one of two blood cultures obtained from the patient, but speciation was initially not performed because the organism was considered to be a contaminant (viridans streptococci group). The diagnosis was ultimately confirmed using 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing of purulent fluid obtained from a muscle abscess aspirate. The present case serves to emphasize that finding even a single positive blood culture of an organism belonging to the S anginosus group should prompt careful evaluation of the patient for a pyogenic focus of infection. It also highlights the potential utility of 16S ribosomal DNA amplification and sequencing in direct pathogen detection from aspirated fluid in cases of pyomyositis in which antimicrobial therapy was initiated before specimen collection.
TI  - A streptolysin S homologue is essential for beta-haemolytic Streptococcus constellatus subsp. constellatus cytotoxicity.
AB  - Streptococcus constellatus is a member of the Anginosus group streptococci (AGS)  and primarily inhabits the human oral cavity. S. constellatus is composed of three subspecies: S. constellatus subsp. constellatus (SCC), S. constellatus subsp. pharyngis and the newly described subspecies S. constellatus subsp. viborgensis. Although previous studies have established that SCC contains beta-haemolytic strains, the factor(s) responsible for beta-haemolysis in beta-haemolytic SCC (beta-SCC) has yet to be clarified. Recently, we discovered that a streptolysin S (SLS) homologue is the beta-haemolytic factor of beta-haemolytic Streptococcus anginosus subsp. anginosus (beta-SAA), another member of the AGS. Furthermore, because previous studies have suggested that other AGS species, except for Streptococcus intermedius, do not possess a haemolysin(s) belonging to the family of cholesterol-dependent cytolysins, we hypothesized that, as with beta-SAA, the SLS homologue is the beta-haemolytic factor of beta-SCC, and therefore aimed to investigate and characterize the haemolytic factor of beta-SCC in the present study. PCR amplification revealed that all of the tested beta-SCC strains were positive for the sagA homologue of SCC (sagA(SCC)). Further investigations using beta-SCC strain W277 were conducted to elucidate the relationship between sagA(SCC) and beta-haemolysis by constructing sagA(SCC) deletion mutants, which completely lost beta-haemolytic activity. This loss of beta-haemolytic activity was restored by trans-complementation of sagA(SCC). Furthermore, a co-cultivation assay established that the cytotoxicity of beta-SCC was clearly dependent on the presence of sagA(SCC). These results demonstrate that sagA(SCC) is the factor responsible for beta-SCC beta-haemolysis and cytotoxicity.
TI  - Population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (VGS) isolated from the upper respiratory tract of patients in the community.
AB  - A study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (VGS) isolated the upper respiratory tract of adult and paediatric patients within the community. VGS are common commensal bacterial inhabitants of the upper respiratory tract and valuable sentinel reporters of underlying antibiotic resistance (AR). Laboratory examination of the colonising VGS species may provide a valuable ecological description of the species isolated from the upper respiratory tract and their antibiotic susceptibility, including an estimation of the AR reservoir in this population. Freshly obtained nasal and oropharyngeal swabs from 84 patients were examined by selective conventional culture on Mitis-Salivarius agar and yielded 363 isolates of VGS. Sequence analyses of the rpnB and 16-23S rRNA ITS genes identified these isolates to belong to 10 species of VGS and included S. anginosus, S. australis, S. constellatus, S. infantis, S. mitis, S. oralis, S. parasanguinis, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis and S. vestibularis. The most frequent VGS organisms isolated was S. salivarius (282/363; 78.0%), followed by S. sanguinis (23/363; 6.3%), S. parasanguinis (21/363; 5.8%), S. mitis (18/363; 5.0%), S. anginosus (5/363; 1.4%), S. vestibularis (5/363; 1.4%), S. australis (3/363; 0.8%), S. oralis (3/363; 0.8%), S. infantis (1/363; 0.3%) and S. constellatus (1/363; 0.3%). All patients examined carried at least one VGS organism, where there were 17 combination patterns of carriage of the 10 species of VGS species isolated, where 54.2%, 37.3%, 7.2% and 1.2% of patients harboured one, two, three and four different VGS species, respectively. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard disk diffusion assay testing against four classes of antibiotics, including the b-lactams [cefotaxime, cefuroxime], the tetracyclines [doxycycline], the fluoroquinolones [levofloxacin] and the macrolides [erythromycin]. Overall, there was no resistance to levofloxacin and cefuroxime, with limited resistance to cefotaxime (3.3%) and doxycycline (9.8%). Antibiotic resistance was highest in erythromycin, where 40.9% of isolates were resistant. S. vestibularis was the most antibiotic resistance of all VGS species examined (S. vestibularis v S. salivarius p=0.011), followed by S. anginosis. S. salivarius was the most antibiotic susceptible VGS species examined. Overall, given their infrequency in causing infection, relatively few studies to date have attempted to examine their ecology in their preferred body niche, namely the upper respiratory tract. However, knowing their prevalence is becoming increasingly important in relation to their ability to exclude significant respiratory pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae. In conclusion, these data indicate that VGS colonisation of the upper respiratory tract in individuals within the community is dominated mainly with relatively antibiotic susceptible S. salivarius.
TI  - Pneumonia and empyema caused by Streptococcus intermedius that shows the diagnostic importance of evaluating the microbiota in the lower respiratory tract.
AB  - The bacterial species in the Streptococcus anginosus group (S. constellatus, S. anginosus, S. intermedius) are important causative pathogens of bacterial pneumonia, pulmonary abscesses and empyema. However, the bacteria in this group are primarily oral resident bacteria and unable to grow significantly on ordinary aerobic culture media. We experienced a case of pneumonia and empyema caused by Streptococcus intermedius detected using a 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and pleural effusion, but not sputum. Even when applying the molecular method, sputum samples are occasionally unsuitable for identifying the causative pathogens of lower respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Phylogenetic relationship and virulence inference of Streptococcus Anginosus Group: curated annotation and whole-genome comparative analysis support distinct species designation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Streptococcus Anginosus Group (SAG) represents three closely related species of the viridans group streptococci recognized as commensal bacteria of the oral, gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts. The SAG also cause severe invasive infections, and are pathogens during cystic fibrosis (CF) pulmonary exacerbation. Little genomic information or description of virulence mechanisms is currently available for SAG. We conducted intra and inter species whole-genome comparative analyses with 59 publically available Streptococcus genomes and seven in-house closed high quality finished SAG genomes; S. constellatus (3), S. intermedius (2), and S. anginosus (2). For each SAG species, we sequenced at least one numerically dominant strain from CF airways recovered during acute exacerbation and an invasive, non-lung isolate. We also evaluated microevolution that occurred within two isolates that were cultured from one individual one year apart. RESULTS: The SAG genomes were most closely related to S. gordonii and S. sanguinis, based on shared orthologs and harbor a similar number of proteins within each COG category as other Streptococcus species. Numerous characterized streptococcus virulence factor homologs were identified within the SAG genomes including; adherence, invasion, spreading factors, LPxTG cell wall proteins, and two component histidine kinases known to be involved in virulence gene regulation. Mobile elements, primarily integrative conjugative elements and bacteriophage, account for greater than 10% of the SAG genomes. S. anginosus was the most variable species sequenced in this study, yielding both the smallest and the largest SAG genomes containing multiple genomic rearrangements, insertions and deletions. In contrast, within the S. constellatus and S. intermedius species, there was extensive continuous synteny, with only slight differences in genome size between strains. Within S. constellatus we were able to determine important SNPs and changes in VNTR numbers that occurred over the course of one year. CONCLUSIONS: The comparative genomic analysis of the SAG clarifies the phylogenetics of these bacteria and supports the distinct species classification. Numerous potential virulence determinants were identified and provide a foundation for further studies into SAG pathogenesis. Furthermore, the data may be used to enable the development of rapid diagnostic assays and therapeutics for these pathogens.
TI  - Invasive Streptococcus anginosus group infection-does the species predict the outcome?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is an association between the species of Streptococcus anginosus group (SAG) bacteria and the clinical outcome. METHODS: Isolates from invasive infections caused by SAG bacteria at our institution between January 2004 and February 2009 were identified phenotypically to the taxonomic level of species. Clinical data from the medical records of the patients from whom these isolates were recovered were obtained retrospectively and analyzed. RESULTS: Patients with invasive Streptococcus intermedius infections had a significantly longer hospital stay than patients infected with S. anginosus (p = 0.024) and a significantly higher 30-day all-cause mortality than patients infected with Streptococcus constellatus (p = 0.049). CONCLUSION: Identification of SAG bacteria to the taxonomic level of species may be of prognostic importance.
TI  - The predominant bacteria isolated from radicular cysts.
AB  - PURPOSE: To detect predominant bacteria associated with radicular cysts and discuss in light of the literature. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical materials were obtained from 35 radicular cysts by aspiration. Cultures were made from clinical materials by modern laboratory techniques, they underwent microbiologic analysis. RESULTS: The following are microorganisms isolated from cultures: Streptococcus milleri Group (SMG) (23.8%) [Streptococcus constellatus (19.1%) and Streptococcus anginosus (4.7%)], Streptococcus sanguis (14.3%), Streptococcus mitis (4.7%), Streptococcus cremoris (4.7%), Peptostreptococcus pevotii (4.7%), Prevotella buccae (4.7%), Prevotella intermedia (4.7%), Actinomyces meyeri (4.7%), Actinomyces viscosus (4.7%), Propionibacterium propionicum (4.7%), Bacteroides capillosus (4.7%), Staphylococcus hominis (4.7%), Rothia denticariosa (4.7%), Gemella haemolysans (4.7%), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (4.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study demonstrated that radicular cysts show a great variety of anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial flora. It was observed that all isolated microorganisms were the types commonly found in oral flora. Although no specific microorganism was found, Streptococcus spp. bacteria (47.5%) - especially SMG (23.8%) - were predominantly found in the microorganisms isolated. Furthermore, radicular cysts might be polymicrobial originated. Although radicular cyst is an inflammatory cyst, some radicular cyst fluids might be sterile.
TI  - Periocular necrotizing fasciitis causing blindness.
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Periocular necrotizing fasciitis is a rare but potentially devastating disease, accompanied by high rates of morbidity and mortality. OBSERVATIONS: We report 5 cases of periocular necrotizing fasciitis resulting in severe vision loss, 3 of which required exenteration to contain the disease and only 1 of which recovered vision. Three cases were caused by group A streptococcus; 1, by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; and 1, by Streptococcus anginosus constellatus. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Providers should maintain a high clinical suspicion for necrotizing fasciitis and distinguish it from more common forms of cellulitis. As seen in these 5 cases, periocular necrotizing fasciitis may cause severe visual loss more often than previously recognized. To our knowledge, this is also the first report of Streptococcus anginosus constellatus causing necrotizing fasciitis.
TI  - Identification, clinical aspects, susceptibility pattern, and molecular epidemiology of beta-haemolytic group G Streptococcus anginosus group isolates from central Taiwan.
AB  - No literature is available on the prevalence and clinical aspects of beta-haemolytic group G Streptococcus anginosus group in central Taiwan. In this study, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing and 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer sequencing (where necessary) as the gold standard for molecular identification. Twenty-seven S. anginosus group isolates were identified from 273 beta-haemolytic GGS isolates collected from patients in central Taiwan between February 2007 and August 2011. Of the 27 isolates, 22 were S. anginosus and 5 were Streptococcus constellatus. The 3 commercial methods, Rapid ID 32 Strep, API 20 Strep, and Vitek 2 GP card, identified 77.8%, 40.7%, and 37.0% of S. anginosus group isolates, respectively, with acceptable %ID or probability level. All the S. constellatus isolates possessed the lmb gene (encoding laminin-binding protein); however, none of the S. anginosus isolates possessed this gene. All the 27 isolates were susceptible to penicillin. Five S. anginosus group isolates (18.5%) were resistant to erythromycin. The resistance genes, ermB and mefA, were detected in 3 (2 S. anginosus and 1 S. constellatus) and 2 (2 S. anginosus) isolates, respectively. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis showed that most S. anginosus group isolates were genetically diverse. This is the first study to evaluate 3 commercial methods for the identification of beta-haemolytic group G S. anginosus group species, and only the Rapid ID 32 Strep system showed considerable ability. The clinical aspects, susceptibility pattern, and molecular epidemiology of beta-haemolytic group G S. anginosus group isolates from central Taiwan were also first presented.
TI  - Identification of beta-haemolysin-encoding genes in Streptococcus anginosus.
AB  - Streptococcus anginosus is an emerging pathogen, but little is known about its virulence factors. To detect the genes responsible for beta-haemolysis we performed genomic mutagenesis of the beta-haemolytic S. anginosus type strain ATCC 12395 using the vector pGhost9:ISS1. Integration site analysis of 15 non-haemolytic mutants identified a gene cluster with high homology to the genes of the streptolysin S (SLS) encoding sag gene cluster of S. pyogenes. The gene cluster harbours 10 open reading frames displaying significant similarities to the S. pyogenes genes sagA-sagI, with the identities on protein level ranging from 38 to 87%. Complementation assays of S. anginosus sagB and sagD integration mutants with the respective genes confirmed their importance for beta-haemolysin production and suggest the presence of post-translational modifications in S. anginosus SLS similar to SLS of S. pyogenes. Characterization of the S. anginosus haemolysin in comparison to the S. pyogenes SLS showed that the haemolysin is surface bound, but in contrast to S. pyogenes neither fetal calf serum nor RNA was able to stabilize the haemolysin of S. anginosus in culture supernatants. Inhibition of beta-haemolysis by polyethylene glycol of different sizes was carried out, giving no evidence of a pore-forming haemolytic mechanism. Analysis of a whole genome shotgun sequence of Streptococcus constellatus, a closely related streptococcal species that belongs to the S. anginosus group, revealed a similar sag gene cluster. Employing a genomic mutagenesis strategy we were able to determine an SLS encoding gene cluster in S. anginosus and demonstrate its importance for beta-haemolysin production in S. anginosus.
TI  - Development of an ex vivo coculture system to model pulpal infection by Streptococcus anginosus group bacteria.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Streptococcus anginosus group (SAG) bacteria are opportunistic pathogens and a major cause of pulpal infection and subsequent abscess formation. Understanding of the processes involved in SAG oral infections has been limited by the lack of an appropriate model system. METHODS: Cocultures of SAG bacteria and mammalian tooth slices were maintained using a combination of Dulbecco modified eagle medium and brain-heart infusion broth at 60 rpm, 37 degrees C, 5% CO(2) for 4, 8, or 24 hours before histologic examination or staining with acridine orange/ethidium bromide. Tooth slices were also incubated as described with SAG bacteria stained with fluorescein diacetate. Pulps were extirpated from infected and sterile cultured tooth slices, messenger RNA was extracted and converted to complementary DNA, and polymerase chain reaction were performed for genes encoding tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1beta, and interleukin-6. RESULTS: SAG bacteria were able to adhere directly to the central region of the pulpal matrix in small foci that were associated with a localized matrix breakdown. Acridine orange-ethidium bromide staining and cell counts indicated a decrease in mammalian cell viability with increasing incubation times in the presence of SAG bacteria. The increased expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 1beta was detected in infected tooth slices. CONCLUSIONS: A novel ex vivo model system has been developed that allows coculture of SAG bacteria with a 3-dimensional organotypic tooth slice. The model allows observation of bacterial growth patterns and subsequent responses from host tissues. Therefore, it may be of future use in testing the efficacy of both antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory treatments for use in endodontic therapy.
TI  - Taxonomy of the Anginosus group of the genus Streptococcus and description of Streptococcus anginosus subsp. whileyi subsp. nov. and Streptococcus constellatus subsp. viborgensis subsp. nov.
AB  - The Anginosus group of the genus Streptococcus has been the subject of much taxonomic confusion, which has hampered the full appreciation of its clinical significance. The purpose of this study was to critically re-examine the taxonomy of the Anginosus group, with special attention to beta-haemolytic, Lancefield group C strains, using multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) combined with 16S rRNA gene sequence and phenotypic analyses. Phylogenetic analysis of concatenated sequences of seven housekeeping genes previously used for examination of viridans streptococci distinguished seven distinct and coherent clusters in the Anginosus group. Analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences and phenotypic characters supported the MLSA clustering and currently recognized taxa of the Anginosus group. Single gene analyses showed considerable allele sharing between species, thereby invalidating identification based on single-locus sequencing. Two novel clusters of beta-haemolytic, Lancefield group C strains within the Streptococcus constellatus and Streptococcus anginosus species and isolated from patients with sore throat showed sufficient phylogenetic distances from other clusters to warrant status as novel subspecies. The novel cluster within S. anginosus was identified as the previously recognized DNA homology cluster, DNA group 2. The names S. anginosus subsp. whileyi subsp. nov. (type strain CCUG 39159(T) = DSM 25818(T) = SK1267(T)) and S. constellatus subsp. viborgensis subsp. nov. (type strain SK1359(T) = CCUG 62387(T) = DSM 25819(T)) are proposed.
TI  - Presumed hydrogen sulfide-mediated neurotoxicity after streptococcus anginosus group meningitis.
AB  - Hydrogen sulfide is an environmental toxicant and gaseous neurotransmitter. It is produced enterically by sulfur-reducing bacteria and invasive pathogens including Streptococcus anginosus group, Salmonella and Citrobacter. We describe putative focal hydrogen sulfide neurotoxicity after Streptococcus constellatus meningitis, treated with adjunctive sodium nitrite and hyperbaric oxygen therapy.
TI  - Real-time monitoring of the adherence of Streptococcus anginosus group bacteria to extracellular matrix decorin and biglycan proteoglycans in biofilm formation.
AB  - Members of the Streptococcus anginosus group (SAGs) are significant pathogens. However, their pathogenic mechanisms are incompletely understood. This study investigates the adherence of SAGs to the matrix proteoglycans decorin and biglycan of soft gingival and alveolar bone. Recombinant chondroitin 4-sulphate(C4S)-conjugated decorin and biglycan were synthesised using mammalian expression systems. C4S-conjugated decorin/biglycan and dermatan sulphate (DS) decorin/biglycan were isolated from ovine alveolar bone and gingival connective tissue, respectively. Using surface plasmon resonance, adherence of the SAGs S. anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus and Streptococcus intermedius to immobilised proteoglycan was assessed as a function of real-time biofilm formation. All isolates adhered to gingival proteoglycan, 59% percent of isolates adhered to alveolar proteoglycans, 70% to recombinant decorin and 76% to recombinant biglycan. Higher adherence was generally noted for S. constellatus and S. intermedius isolates. No differences in adherence were noted between commensal and pathogenic strains to decorin or biglycan. DS demonstrated greater adherence compared to C4S. Removal of the glycosaminoglycan chains with chondroitinase ABC resulted in no or minimal adherence for all isolates. These results suggest that SAGs bind to the extracellular matrix proteoglycans decorin and biglycan, with interaction mediated by the conjugated glycosaminoglycan chain.
TI  - [Problems with identification of beta-hemolytic streptococcus resistant to bacitracin isolated from patients with pharyngitis].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The genus Streptococcus comprises a number of species characterized by a differential pathogenic potential. These bacteria can be considered as members of microbial physiological flora but they can also cause mild infections or severe, life threatening conditions. The majority of infections of streptococcal etiology are caused by beta-hemolysing species. The predominant causative agent of bacterial pharyngitis is Streptococcus pyogenes. This species usually doesn't give rise to any identification difficulties due to the introduction the well determined diagnostic schemes. Problems concerning laboratory identification can be, however, associated with other species of beta-hemolysing streptococci isolated from patients with pharyngitis. These streptococci can demonstrate features similar to those of S. pyogenes and share the group antygen A, such as some strains of Streptococcus anginosus and Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. The determination of sensitivity to bacitracin, which is a feature typical of S. pyogenes, is the basic test useful for its preliminary identification. Nevertheless, the identification of some strains by this test can give rise to incompatibility. The aim of the study was characterisation of beta-hemolysing streptococci resistant to bacitracin isolated from patients with pharyngitis. The examined bacterial strains caused identification problems by the use of routine diagnostic methods. METHODS: The material included 14 streptococcal strains resistant to bacitracin which were isolated from adult patients suffering from pharyngitis. The bacteria were cultured on media dedicated for the species. The following routine diagnostic tests were used for the bacterial identification: sensitivity to bacitracin (0.04 U/disc), CAMP test, determination of the group antigens A, B, C, D, F and G (Slidex Strepto-Kit), and determination of biochemical features by the API 20 STREP test (bioMerieux). The sensitivity of streptococcal isolates to antibiotics (penicillin, clindamycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, vancomycin, ofloxacin) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, was determined by the disc diffusion method on the Mueller-Hinton agar with 5% sheep blood (the inoculum-0.5 McFarland). RESULTS: Among the 14 isolates resistant to bacitracin, 6 isolates of S. pyogenes, 6 isolates of S. constellatus, and 2 isolates of S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis were identified. All isolates were sensitive to penicillin and vancomycin. One isolate ofS. pyogenes demonstrated constitutive MLSB resistance mechanism. Seven isolates were resistant to tetracycline: S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (3 isolates), S. constellatus (3), and S. pyogenes (1). The number of isolates resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was as follows: S. pyogenes (6) and S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (1), whereas four isolates were resistant to ofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: The bacitracin test cannot be used as the only test for the laboratory identification of S. pyogenes even if it is combined with the determination of the Lancefield group antigen due to the existence of bacitracin resistant S. pyogenes strains. Therefore, it is necessary to perform biochemical commercial tests in addition to routine phenotypic tests. Isolation of beta-hemolysing streptococci other than S. pyogenes from patients with pharyngitis confirms their role in the etiology of this infection. Taken into account the significance of determination of sensitivity to bacitracin for the preliminary identification of S. pyogenes, it is necessary to standardize this test, which will make obtaining of the comparability of results possible.
TI  - Streptococcus troglodytidis sp. nov., isolated from a foot abscess of a chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes).
AB  - A facultative anaerobic, non-motile, non-spore-forming, Gram-positive-staining, coccus-shaped bacterium was isolated from an abscess on the right foot of a chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes). The colonies were beta-haemolytic. Catalase and oxidase activities were negative. The Lancefield group B antigen was expressed. On the basis of morphological and biochemical characteristics, the bacterium was tentatively identified as a streptococcal species. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that the bacterium shared 96.7 %, 96.4 %, 96.1 %, 95.8 % and 95.7 % sequence similarities with Streptococcus gordonii, S. cristatus, S. intermedius, S. anginosus and S. constellatus, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses based on the sequences of the 16S rRNA gene and housekeeping genes encoding D-alanine : D-alanine ligase (ddl), the beta-subunit of RNA polymerase (rpoB) and manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase (sodA) revealed that the bacterium represented a novel species closely related to, albeit different from, S. gordonii, S. cristatus and the anginosus streptococci. The name Streptococcus troglodytidis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is M09-11185(T) ( = ATCC BAA-2337(T) = KCTC 33006(T)).
TI  - Endogenous endophthalmitis and liver abscesses.
AB  - We present a case of endogenous endophthalmitis secondary to liver abscesses, in  a patient with no previous medical comorbidities or risk factors for immunosuppression. The patient presented with acute painless loss of vision and feeling generally unwell. Investigations revealed Streptococcus anginosus-constellatus bacteraemia, and evidence of diverticular disease that likely predisposed to the liver abscesses. Due to prompt diagnosis and administration of antibiotics, the patient had a good visual outcome. This case highlights the importance of being aware of endogenous endophthalmitis, as early diagnosis and prompt administration of antibiotics will optimise visual outcomes.
TI  - Milleri group streptococcus--a stepchild in the viridans family.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to provide a comprehensive review of the pathogenic role and spectrum of disease of milleri group streptococci, with special attention to bloodstream invasion and to possible differential roles among the three species. All consecutive isolates of milleri group streptococci from any anatomic source, during a 37-month period, in a tertiary care teaching hospital in Tel-Aviv, Israel, were thoroughly investigated. Identification to the species level was performed by an automated system.Streptococcus anginosus constituted 82% of the 245 patient-unique isolates from hospitalized patients. All nonurinary isolates were involved in pyogenic infections mostly originating from the gastrointestinal tract, with bacteremia in 28 cases. The 71 urinary isolates represented either urinary tract infection or nonsignificant bacteriuria. No specific association could be detected between species and the infection site, except for a higher relative representation of Streptococcus constellatus in bacteremia. Milleri group streptococci are common in clinical practice and play a different pathogenic role to other viridans streptococci. Due to their invariable association with pyogenic processes, their presence in blood warrants immediate focus identification. In addition, they have a previously unappreciated clinical niche concerning urinary tract infection. The identification of viridans streptococci to the species level is of paramount clinical significance.
TI  - Effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation between oral streptococci and Actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The co-aggregation of oral bacteria leads to their clearance from the oral cavity. Poor oral hygiene and high saliva viscosity are common amongst the elderly; thus, they frequently suffer from pneumonia caused by the aspiration of oral microorganisms. OBJECTIVES: To examine the direct effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen oral streptococcal and a single actinomyces strain were used. Co-aggregation was assessed by a visual assay in phosphate buffer and a spectrophotometric assay in the same buffer containing 0-60% glycerol or whole saliva. RESULTS: Nine oral streptococci co-aggregated with Actinomyces naeslundii ATCC12104 in the visual assay and were subsequently used for the spectrophotometric analysis. All tested strains displayed a decrease in co-aggregation with increasing amounts of glycerol in the buffer. The co-aggregation of Streptococcus oralis with A. naeslundii recovered to baseline level following the removal of glycerol. The per cent co-aggregation of S. oralis with A. naeslundii was significantly correlated with the viscosity in unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva samples (correlation coefficients: -0.52 and -0.48, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that saliva viscosity affects the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces and that bacterial co-aggregation decreases with increasing saliva viscosity.
TI  - [A method for differential identification of group C and G streptococci with PCR].
AB  - The paper describes a rapid method for PCR identification of Groups C and G streptococci (Streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis, Streptococcus constellatus, and Streptococcus anginosus) that cause human disease. Species-specific regions of the cpn60 gene encoding heat shock protein GroEL (HSP60) were chosen as markers for PCR diagnosis; three pairs of primers were constructed for these regions, each of which was peculiar to the specific type. The method was tested on a large collection of pathogenic streptococci of different serogroups isolated from man and animals; its specificity was shown to identify S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, S. constellatus, and S. anginosus. The proposed method has all benefits of PCR-based techniques, which enables it to be used for the purposes of molecular epidemiology.
TI  - Contribution of Streptococcus anginosus to infections caused by groups C and G streptococci, southern India.
AB  - Vellore, a region in southern India, has a high incidence of severe human infections with Beta-hemolytic group C and G streptococci (GCGS). To determine the causative species in these infections, we conducted 16S rRNA gene sequencing: Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (81%) and S. anginosus (19%) were the causative organisms in the 2-year study period (2006-2007). We used PCR to detect the virulence-related emm gene; results showed that it was restricted to S. dysgalactieae subsp. equisimilis isolates of 99.2% tested positive. Due to a novel marker, S. anginosus and S. constellatus can be quickly and accurately distinguished from other members of the genus. The notable contribution of the anginosus group to human infections suggests that this group of obligate pathogens deserves more attention in healthcare and research.
TI  - Development of real-time PCR assays for detection of the Streptococcus milleri group from cystic fibrosis clinical specimens by targeting the cpn60 and 16S rRNA genes.
AB  - Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multiorgan disease, with the majority of mortalities resulting from pulmonary failure due to repeated pulmonary exacerbations. Recently, members of the Streptococcus anginosus group (S. anginosus, S. constellatus, and S. intermedius), herein referred to as the "Streptococcus milleri group" (SMG) have been implicated as important etiological pathogens contributing to pulmonary exacerbations in CF patients. This is partly due to better microbiological detection of the SMG species through the development of a novel specific medium termed "McKay agar." McKay agar demonstrated that SMG has been an underreported respiratory pathogen contributing to lung exacerbations. Our aim was to develop a real-time PCR assay to expedite the detection of SMG within diagnostic samples. The cpn60 gene was chosen as a target, with all three members amplified using a single hybridization probe set. SMG strain analysis showed that speciation based on melting curve analysis allowed for the majority of the S. constellatus (96%), S. intermedius (94%), and S. anginosus (60%) strains to be correctly identified. To increase specificity for S. anginosus, two 16S rRNA real-time PCR assays were developed targeting the 16S rRNA gene. The 16s_SA assay is specific for S. anginosus (100%), while the 16s_SCI assay is specific for S. constellatus and S. intermedius (100%). These assays can detect <10 genome equivalents in pure culture and >10(4) genome equivalents in sputum samples, making this a great tool for assessment of the presence of SMG in complex polymicrobial samples. Novel molecular methods were developed providing detection ability for SMG, an emerging opportunistic pathogen.
TI  - McKay agar enables routine quantification of the 'Streptococcus milleri' group in cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  - The 'Streptococcus milleri' group (SMG) has recently been recognized as a contributor to bronchopulmonary disease in cystic fibrosis (CF). Routine detection and quantification is limited by current CF microbiology protocols. McKay agar was developed previously for the semi-selective isolation of this group. Here, McKay agar was validated against a panel of clinical SMG isolates, which revealed improved SMG recovery compared with Columbia blood agar. The effectiveness of this medium was evaluated by appending it to the standard CF sputum microbiology protocols in a clinical laboratory for a 6-month period. All unique colony types were isolated and identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Whilst a wide variety of organisms were isolated, members of the SMG were the most prevalent bacteria cultured, and McKay agar allowed routine quantification of the SMG from 10(3) to >10(8) c.f.u. ml(-1) directly from sputum. All members of the SMG were detected [Streptococcus anginosus (40.7 %), Streptococcus intermedius (34.3 %) and Streptococcus constellatus (25 %)] with an overall prevalence rate of 40.6 % in our adult CF population. Without exception, samples where SMG isolates were cultured at 10(7) c.f.u. ml(-1) or greater were associated with pulmonary exacerbations. This study demonstrates that McKay agar can be used routinely to quantify the SMG from complex clinical samples.
TI  - Characterization of Streptococcus milleri group isolates from expectorated sputum of adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - With the recent insights into the Streptococcus milleri group (SMG) as pulmonary  pathogens in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), we sought to characterize 128 isolates from the sputum of adults with CF, along with 45 isolates from patients with invasive diseases for comparison. The tests performed included Lancefield grouping; tests for hemolysis; tests for the production of hyaluronidase, chondroitin sulfatase, DNase, proteases, and hydrogen peroxide; and PCR for the detection of the intermedilysin gene (ily). We also generated biochemical profiles with the Rapid ID Strep 32 API system and tested cell-free supernatants for the presence of the signal molecule autoinducer-2 (AI-2) using a Vibrio harveyi bioassay with a subset of CF strains. The S. intermedius isolates from both strain collections were similar, while the S. constellatus and S. anginosus isolates yielded several biotypes that differed in prevalence between the two strain collections. Beta-hemolytic, Lancefield group C S. constellatus comprised 74.4% of the S. constellatus isolates from patients with CF but only 13.3% of the corresponding isolates from patients with invasive infections. This was the only S. constellatus biotype associated with pulmonary exacerbations. Hyaluronidase-positive S. anginosus was detected only among the isolates from patients with CF. Strain-to-strain variability in AI-2 expression was evident, with the mean values being the highest for S. anginosus, followed by S. constellatus and then S. intermedius. Cluster analysis and 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that the species of SMG could be accurately determined with a minimum of three phenotypic tests: tests for the Lancefield group, hyaluronidase production, and chondroitin sulfatase production. Furthermore, isolates from patients with invasive infections clustered with isolates from the sputum of patients with CF, suggesting that the respiratory tract isolates were equally pathogenic.
TI  - Partial recN gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - Partial sequences of the recN gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. The partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. The mean DNA sequence similarity of recN gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be lower than those of the 16S rRNA gene (94.1 %), rpoB (84.6 %), sodA (74.8 %), groEL (78.1 %) and gyrB (73.2 %). Phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: Streptococcus salivarius, S. equinus, S. hyovaginalis/S. pluranimalium/S. thoraltensis, S. pyogenes, S. mutans and S. suis. The 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: Streptococcus sanguinis/S. cristatus/S. sinensis, S. anginosus/S. intermedius/S. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and S. mitis/S. infantis/S. peroris/S. oralis/S. oligofermentans/S. pneumoniae/S. pseudopneumoniae. The partial recN gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. This observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groEL, gyrB, rpoB and sodA). A high percentage of similarity was found between S. intermedius and S. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recN gene. To study the genetic diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recN, groEL, sodA, gyrB and rpoB sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. The results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.
TI  - Streptococcus constellatus bacteremia causing septic shock following tooth extraction: a case report.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Organisms of the Streptococcus milleri group consists of Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus constellatus, and Streptococcus anginosus. Though they are commonly associated with abscesses, bacteremia with subsequent septic shock and mortality is infrequent. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 27-year-old Chinese man who presented with Streptococcus constellatus bacteremia following an incomplete tooth extraction resulting in septic shock. CONCLUSION: Bacteremia from the Streptococcus milleri group is infrequent but must trigger the search for an underlying abscess. Knowledge of each member's predilection for different clinical presentations can aid in determining the location of the underlying source of infection.
TI  - Evaluation of genotypic and phenotypic methods for differentiation of the members of the Anginosus group streptococci.
AB  - The terminology and classification of the Anginosus group streptococci has been inconsistent. We tested the utility of 16S rRNA gene and tuf gene sequencing and conventional biochemical tests for the reliable differentiation of the Anginosus group streptococci. Biochemical testing included Rapid ID 32 Strep, API Strep, Fluo-Card Milleri, Wee-tabs, and Lancefield antigen typing. Altogether, 61 Anginosus group isolates from skin and soft tissue infections and four reference strains were included. Our results showed a good agreement between 16S rRNA gene and tuf gene sequencing. Using the full sequence was less discriminatory than using the first part of the 16S rRNA gene. The three species could not be separated with the API 20 Strep test. Streptococcus intermedius could be differentiated from the other two species by beta-galactosidase (ONPG) and beta-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase reactions. Rapid ID 32 Strep beta-glucosidase reaction was useful in separating S. anginosus strains from S. constellatus. In conclusion, both 16S rRNA gene and tuf gene sequencing can be used for the reliable identification of the Anginosus group streptococci. S. intermedius can be readily differentiated from the other two species by phenotypic tests; however, 16S rRNA gene or tuf gene sequencing may be needed for separating some strains of S. constellatus from S. anginosus.
TI  - Identification and molecular analysis of betaC-S lyase producing hydrogen sulfide in Streptococcus intermedius.
AB  - Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is a toxic gas that induces the modification and release of haemoglobin in erythrocytes; however, it also functions in methionine biosynthesis in bacteria. betaC-S lyase, encoded by the lcd gene, is responsible for bacterial H(2)S production through the cleavage of l-cysteine. In this study, 26 of 29 crude extracts from reference and clinical strains of Streptococcus intermedius produced H(2)S from l-cysteine. The capacities in those strains were not higher than those in strains of the other anginosus group of streptococci, Streptococcus anginosus and Streptococcus constellatus, but were much greater than those in strains of Streptococcus gordonii, which is known to have an extremely low capacity for H(2)S production. Incubation of the remaining three extracts with l-cysteine did not result in H(2)S production. Sequence analysis revealed that the lcd genes from these three strains (S. intermedius strains ATCC 27335, IMU151 and IMU202) contained mutations or small deletions. H(2)S production in crude extracts prepared from S. intermedius ATCC 27335 was restored by repairing the lcd gene sequence in genomic DNA. The kinetic properties of the purified recombinant protein encoded by the repaired lcd gene were comparable to those of native proteins produced by H(2)S-producing strains, whereas the truncated protein produced by S. intermedius ATCC 27335 had no enzymic activity with l-cysteine or l-cystathionine. However, real-time PCR analysis indicated that the lcd gene in strains ATCC 27335, IMU151 and IMU202 is transcribed and regulated in a manner similar to that in the H(2)S-producing strain.
TI  - Molecular and enzymatic characterization of betaC-S lyase in Streptococcus constellatus.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Streptococcus anginosus and Streptococcus constellatus are frequently isolated from dental abscesses and other suppurative lesions. We previously reported that betaC-S lyase from a strain of S. anginosus produced significantly more hydrogen sulfide than betaC-S lyases from other streptococci. The purpose of this study was to establish the molecular and enzymatic features of the betaC-S lyase in S. constellatus and to elucidate whether this unique capacity is common to many strains of S. constellatus and S. anginosus. METHODS: The capacity of crude extract to produce hydrogen sulfide was evaluated among 16 strains of S. constellatus, S. anginosus, and Streptococcus gordonii. The lcd gene encoding betaC-S lyase was cloned from the genomic DNA of each strain to compare the deduced amino acid sequences. The recombinant betaC-S lyases of three representative strains were purified and characterized. RESULTS: Incubation of crude extracts from all strains of S. constellatus and S. anginosus with l-cysteine resulted in the production of a large amount of hydrogen sulfide. The primary sequence of betaC-S lyase was very similar among strains of S. constellatus and S. anginosus. The kinetic properties of the betaC-S lyases purified from S. constellatus resembled those for betaC-S lyases purified from S. anginosus. In contrast, the betaC-S lyases of S. constellatus and S. gordonii differed in terms of their hydrogen sulfide production, with the former producing much more. CONCLUSION: A high level of hydrogen sulfide production, which appears to be a common feature in both S. constellatus and S. anginosus, may be associated with their abscess formation.
TI  - Streptococcus milleri group infection associated with digestive fistula in patients with vascular graft: report of seven cases and review.
AB  - We described seven patients with Streptococcus milleri group aortic (six patients) or vena cava (one patient) graft infection secondary to a vasculo-digestive fistula. Time between vascular graft setting and first clinical signs varied from eight months to more than thirteen years. Six patients had fever. Three patients presented with recurrent fever for more than nine months and in two of these cases, delay before diagnosis was long because repeated blood cultures were sterile. Three patients had abdominal pain and/or digestive haemorrhage. Abdominal CT-scan S. milleri was not contributive for the diagnosis in four patients. Streptococcus anginosus was isolated in four patients, Streptococcus constellatus in three patients. One patient died before surgical management. The other six patients were cured by a surgical management associated with a prolonged antibiotic (lactams) treatment. S. milleri group graft infections are rare (or misdiagnosed) while we found only 4 similar cases in the English medical literature. We conclude that a peri-prosthetic infection secondary to a digestive fistula must be insistently searched (and blood cultures must be repeated many times) in any patient with an aortic (or any other vascular) graft presenting prolonged or recurrent fever or acute digestive symptoms.
TI  - Oral streptococcal strains isolated from odontogenic infections and their susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  - The aim of this study was to identify at species level and to investigate the antibiotic susceptibility of oral streptococcal strains isolated from 100 pus samples collected from Romanian patients with different odontogenic infections. The isolates were identified at species level using the Rapid ID 32 STREP system and their susceptibility was testing by the Etest, against: penicillin G, ampicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin and tetracycline. For the investigation of erythromycin resistance phenotype the disk diffusion test was used. The isolates belonged to several species, with Streptococcus anginosus and Streptococcus oralis predominating. Reduced susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics was found only among the isolates belonging to S. mitis and S. sanguinis groups. Resistance to erythromycin was detected among all species, except for: S. constellatus, S. intermedius and S. gordonii, and the M phenotype was established, while resistance to tetracycline was detected within all species but S. gordonii. In contrast, clindamycin was fully active. As most odontogenic infections are mixed infections, often involving strictly anaerobic bacteria, which are frequently beta-lactamase producers, the association of a penicillin and a beta-lactamase inhibitor, like Amoxiclav, is recommended when the antimicrobial treatment is necessary.
TI  - Group milleri streptococci: significant pathogens in solid organ recipients.
AB  - Group milleri streptococci (GMS) comprise a heterogeneous group of streptococci including the species intermedius, constellatus and anginosus. They may cause chronic intra-abdominal and intrathoracic abscesses, which are difficult to treat. This is a retrospective analysis including 45 transplant recipients in whom GMS were isolated. The epidemiology, clinical significance and the impact on the outcome in all transplant patients with infections caused by GMS during a 4-year period (2001-2004) was evaluated. The 45 solid organ recipients (88 isolates) included 34 liver-, four kidney/pancreas-, one kidney-, two small bowel-, three combined liver/kidney- and one combined kidney/small bowel transplant recipient. In 42 cases GMS caused intra-abdominal infection, in two cases pleural empyema and in one case soft tissue infection. Only a single isolate of GMS was cultured from blood. In 54 of the 88 specimens (61%), which grew GMS, other pathogens were also isolated. GMS frequently caused recurrent cholangitis (n = 17) associated with anastomotic and nonanastomotic biliary strictures. These cases were managed by repeated stenting or surgical intervention and prolonged antibiotic therapy. No patient died directly related to GMS infection and all except one case responded to combined surgical/antibiotic treatment. One pancreas graft was lost because of erosion haemorrhage associated with an abscess. GMS were susceptible to penicillin G, carbapenems and clindamycin, whereas cephalosporins and quinolones showed intermediate activity or resistance in some cases, and GMS in general were found resistant to aminoglycosides. GMS may cause serious infections in transplant recipients which are difficult to treat. Their prevalence in transplant surgical site infections thus far may have been underestimated.
TI  - Tigecycline (GAR-936) activity against Streptococcus gallolyticus (bovis) and viridans group streptococci.
AB  - Viridans group streptococci including Streptococcus gallolyticus (formerly S. bovis) represent serious invasive pathogens often associated with endocarditis or sepsis among immunocompromised or cancer patients. Tigecycline (GAR-936), the first clinically studied glycylcycline, has a potent gram-positive activity with a potential treatment option for these streptococcal infections. The studied collection (848 strains) included 100 isolates each of Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis, and fewer strains of S. gallolyticus (98 strains) and Streptococcus mutans (50 strains). These strains were isolated from patients on 3 continents in the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program and tested for susceptibility and interpreted by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute broth microdilution methods and criteria (< or = 0.25 microg/mL for tigecycline per US Food and Drug Administration). Penicillin susceptibility rates for the entire collection varied from 61% (S. sanguis) to 98% (S. constellatus), and macrolide susceptibility was also compromised (49-88%; average, 69%). Tigecycline was active against all isolates tested, in contrast to tetracycline resistance rates of 8-66%, and highest for S. gallolyticus. In conclusion tigecycline was quite active against bacteremic isolates of viridans group streptococci species and S. gallolyticus with an overall MIC90 at < or = 0.06 microg/mL; the highest MIC was only 0.25 microg/mL.
TI  - Images in clinical medicine. Elevated jugular venous pressure.
TI  - [Streptococcus milleri. An early sign of cancer in otorhinolaryngologic patients?].
AB  - The Streptococcus milleri group, which also includes S. anginosus, S. intermedius and S. constellatus, is found in the oropharynx and gastrointestinal tract mucosa. Recent isolations of S. milleri DNA sequences have been made from both gastric and oesophageal carcinoma. There are only a few publications on the isolation of viable bacteria and S. milleri DNA, and their role in carcinogenesis, in otorhinolaryngologic malignoma. We present four patients with a cervical abscess and the isolation of S. milleri -group bacteria, without signs of malignancy or other risk factors. After a delay of several months, squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx was diagnosed in three patients and a neck metastasis without primary tumor in the fourth.
TI  - Rapid differentiation between members of the anginosus group and Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis within beta-hemolytic group C and G streptococci by PCR.
AB  - Based on a pair of primers developed initially for differentiating the anginosus  group from other viridans streptococci, the PCR reported here can also differentiate between members of the anginosus group and Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis among beta-hemolytic group C and G streptococci. The resulting 742-bp PCR product was specific for members of the anginosus group, although a smaller, nonspecific product (361 bp) was generated from S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. Restriction digestion of the amplicon with XbaI and BsmI further differentiated Streptococcus anginosus from Streptococcus constellatus within the anginosus group.
TI  - Acute glomerulonephritis associated with streptococcus pyogenes with concomitant  spread of streptococcus constellatus in four rural families.
AB  - We studied history, renal histopathology and microbiology of an epidemic of acute glomerulonephritis associated with throat infections and uncommon culture results in four neighbour families. A 40-year-old man (index patient) was referred to a university hospital for dialysis and kidney biopsy due to a suspected acute glomerulonephritis. An acute tonsillitis had preceded the condition. Penicillin treatment had been started four days before the discovery of renal failure. Throat swabs were positive for beta-hemolytic streptococci, group C (GCS). GCS were also found in throat cultures from his wife and two of their children. The bacteria were typed as Streptococcus constellatus. A third child had S. constellatus expressing Lancefield antigen group G. A neighbour and two of his children fell ill the following week with renal involvement. Throat swabs from both these children were positive for S. constellatus. His third child had erythema multiforme and S. constellatus in the throat while a fourth child had beta-hemolytic streptococci group A; Streptococcus pyogenes. Kidney biopsies on the index patient and his neighbour showed an acute diffuse prolipherative glomerulonephritis compatible with acute post-streptococcal nephritis and microbiological analysis of renal tissue revealed in both cases S. pyogenes and S. constellatus. The families had had much contact and had consumed unpasteurized milk from our index patient's farm. In four of seven persons in two additional neighbouring families S. constellatus was found in throat swabs during the same month while two persons carried Streptococcus anginosus expressing the Lancefield C antigen. In conclusion spread of S. constellatus coincided with the occurrence of four cases of acute glomerulonephritis. The two biopsied patients had both S. pyogenes and S. constellatus present in renal tissue. The epidemic either suggested that the outbreak of glomerulonephritis was due to S. pyogenes but coincided with the transmission and colonization of S. constellatus or that the S. constellatus strains were highly pathogenic or nephritogenic and that this organism can be transmitted in such cases.
TI  - In vitro activity of sitafloxacin compared with several fluoroquinolones against  Streptococcus anginosus and Streptococcus constellatus.
AB  - The in vitro activities of sitafloxacin and seven other fluoroquinolones a (ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, T-3811ME, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin) were examined by the microdilution method against 79 clinically isolated 'Streptococcus milleri' group (SMG) microorganisms. No statistically significant differences were found between the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC(50) and MIC(90)) against Streptococcus anginosus and Streptococcus constellatus. Sitafloxacin was the most active agent of the eight fluoroquinolones tested against SMG, with a MIC(90) of 0.06 microg/mL, which was 8 times more active than ciprofloxacin and 16 times more active than levofloxacin. Although none of the SMG strains showed high resistance to any of the fluoroquinolones tested, three agents (trovafloxacin, sitafloxacin and T-3811ME) had low MICs against 23 SMG strains against which levofloxacin had a MIC> 1 microg/mL. In conclusion, several fluoroquinolones have low MICs against SMG, but sitafloxacin has the lowest.
TI  - Identification of 43 Streptococcus species by pyrosequencing analysis of the rnpB gene.
AB  - Pyrosequencing technology was evaluated for identification of species within the  Streptococcus genus. Two variable regions in the rnpB gene, which encodes the RNA subunit of endonuclease P, were sequenced in two reactions. Of 43 species, all could be identified to the species level except strains of the species pairs Streptococcus anginosus/S. constellatus and S. infantis/S. peroris. A total of 113 blood culture isolates were identified by pyrosequencing analysis of partial rnpB sequences. All but eight isolates could be unambiguously assigned to a specific species when the first 30 nucleotides of the two regions were compared to an rnpB database comprising 107 streptococcal strains. Principal coordinate analysis of sequence variation of strains from viridans group streptococci resulted in species-specific clusters for the mitis and the salivarius groups but not for the anginosus group. The identification capacity of pyrosequencing was compared to the biochemical test systems VITEK 2 and Rapid ID 32 Strep. The concordance between pyrosequencing and VITEK 2 was 75%, and for Rapid ID 32 Strep the corresponding figure was 77%. Isolates with discrepant identifications in the three methods were subjected to entire rnpB DNA sequence analysis that confirmed the identifications by pyrosequencing. In conclusion, pyrosequencing analysis of the rnpB gene can reliably identify Streptococcus species with high resolution.
TI  - Epidural abscess caused by Streptococcus milleri in a pregnant woman.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria in the Streptococcus milleri group (S. anginosus, S. constellatus, and S. intermedius) are associated with bacteremia and abscess formation. While most reports of Streptococcus milleri group (SMG) infection occur in patients with underlying medical conditions, SMG infections during pregnancy have been documented. However, SMG infections in pregnant women are associated with either neonatal or maternal puerperal sepsis. Albeit rare, S. milleri spinal-epidural abscess in pregnancy has been reported, always as a complication of spinal-epidural anesthesia. We report a case of spinal-epidural abscess caused by SMG in a young, pregnant woman without an antecedent history of spinal epidural anesthesia and without any underlying risk factors for invasive streptococcal disease. CASE PRESENTATION: A 25 year old pregnant woman developed neurological symptoms consistent with spinal cord compression at 20 weeks gestation. She underwent emergency laminectomy for decompression and was treated with ceftriaxone 2 gm IV daily for 28 days. She was ambulatory at the time of discharge from the inpatient rehabilitation unit with residual lower extremity weakness. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a Streptococcus milleri epidural abscess in a healthy, pregnant woman with no history of epidural anesthesia or invasive procedures. This report adds to the body of literature on SMG invasive infections. Treatment of SMG spinal-epidural abscess with neurologic manifestations should include prompt and aggressive surgical decompression coupled with targeted anti-infective therapy.
TI  - Experimental abscess formation caused by human dental plaque.
AB  - Human dental plaque consists of a wide variety of microorganisms, some of which are believed to cause systemic infections, including abscesses, at various sites in the body. To confirm this hypothesis experimentally, we examined the abscess-forming ability of native dental plaque in mice, the microbial features of the infectious locus produced by the plaque, and the anti-phagocytic property of microbial isolates. Aliquots of a suspension of supragingival dental plaque containing 6 x 10(6) colony-forming unit of bacteria were injected subcutaneously into the dorsa of mice. Abscess formation was induced in 76 of 85 mice using ten different plaque samples. Thirteen microorganisms were isolated from pus samples aspirated from abscess lesions. The microbial composition of pus, examined in 17 of 76 abscesses, was very simple compared to that of the plaque sample that had induced the abscess. The majority of the isolates belonged to the Streptococcus anginosus group, normally a minor component of plaque samples. S. anginosus was the most frequently detected organism and the most prevalent in seven abscesses, and Streptococcus intermedius and Streptococcus constellatus were predominant in one and three abscess samples, respectively. Each isolate of S. anginosus group produced abscesses in mice, and heat-treated supragingival dental plaque influenced the abscess-forming ability of S. anginosus isolate. These isolates possessed a high antiphagocytic capacity against human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Our results suggest that human supragingival dental plaque itself is a source of the infectious pathogens that cause abscess formation.
TI  - Identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by an oligonucleotide array.
AB  - Viridans streptococci (VS) are common etiologic agents of subacute infective endocarditis and are capable of causing a variety of pyogenic infections. Many species of VS are difficult to differentiate by phenotypic traits. An oligonucleotide array based on 16S-23S rRNA gene intergenic spacer (ITS) sequences was developed to identify 11 clinically relevant VS. These 11 species were Streptococcus anginosus, S. constellatus, S. gordonii, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguinis, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis, and S. uberis. The method consisted of PCR amplification of the ITS regions by using a pair of universal primers, followed by hybridization of the digoxigenin-labeled PCR products to a panel of species-specific oligonucleotides immobilized on a nylon membrane. After 120 strains of the 11 species of VG and 91 strains of other bacteria were tested, the sensitivity and specificity of the oligonucleotide array were found to be 100% (120 of 120 strains) and 95.6% (87 of 91 strains), respectively. S. pneumoniae cross-hybridized to the probes used for the identification of S. mitis, and simple biochemical tests such as optochin susceptibility or bile solubility should be used to differentiate S. pneumoniae from S. mitis. In conclusion, identification of species of VS by use of the present oligonucleotide array is accurate and could be used as an alternative reliable method for species identification of strains of VS.
TI  - Alkali-resistant bacteria in root canal systems.
AB  - The aim of this study was to isolate and identify alkali-resistant bacteria from  the dentin of infected root canals. Bacteria from homogenized dentin powder made up from infected root canal walls from human teeth were cultured on buffer-enriched Brain Heart Infusion agar supplemented with 4% sheep blood (BHI-blood agar), adjusted to pH 7.0, 9.0 or 10.0. Incubation took place for 7 days at 37 degrees C in an anaerobic glove box. Bacterial strains selected according to colony and morphology were subcultured in buffer-enriched BHI broth adjusted to pH 9.0, 10.0 or 11.0 to confirm their growth as alkali-resistant bacteria. Polymerase chain reaction amplification using specific primer sets and 16S rDNA sequence analysis was performed for identification of alkali-resistant isolates. In the present study, 37 teeth extracted from 37 patients were used for preparation of the dentin powder samples. Bacteria were detected in 25 samples when standard BHI-blood agars (pH 7.0) were used. Of these, 29 strains from 15 samples were alkali resistant, 25 strains growing at pH 9.0 and 4 at pH 10.0. The alkali-resistant strains included Enterococcus faecium (10 strains) and Enterococcus faecalis (2 strains), Enterobacter cancerogenus (1 strains), Fusobacterium nucleatum (1 strains), Klebsiella ornithinolytica (2 strains), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (2 strains), Streptococcus anginosus (2 strains), Streptococcus constellatus (3 strains), and Streptococcus mitis (2 strains). Three strains were also identified as bacteria of genus Firmicutes or Staphylococcus at the genus level. The present study showed that many bacterial species in infected root canal dentin were alkali-resistant at pH 9.0 and/or pH 10.0, and belonged mainly to the genus Enterococcus.
TI  - Molecular analysis of age-related changes of Streptococcus anginosus group and Streptococcus mitis in saliva.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to survey the prevalence of streptococcal species,  especially Streptococcus anginosus (which has been reported to be associated with cancer in the upper digestive tract), Streptococcus constellatus, and Streptococcus intermedius in the saliva of different age groups. A sequence analysis of 16S rDNA was performed and DNA quantified using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The S. anginosus level increased with age, whereas the levels of S. constellatus and S. intermedius did not change. Streptococcus mitis was the predominant species in the saliva of all the age groups but, unlike the S. anginosus, the proportion of S. mitis in the salivary bacteria decreased with age. The increase in S. anginosus with age should be carefully monitored because of its association with diseases, including cancer.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological changes associated with the use of combined antimicrobial therapies to treat "refractory" periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present investigation examined clinical and microbial changes after a combined aggressive antimicrobial therapy in subjects identified as "refractory" to conventional periodontal therapy. METHOD: Fourteen subjects were identified as "refractory" based on full-mouth mean attachment loss and/or >3 sites with attachment loss > or =3 mm following scaling and root planing (SRP), periodontal surgery and systemic antibiotics. After baseline monitoring, subjects received SRP, locally delivered tetracycline at pockets > or =4 mm, systemically administered amoxicillin (500 mg, t.i.d. for 14 days)+metronidazole (250 mg, t.i.d. for 14 days) and professional removal of supragingival plaque weekly for 3 months. Subjects were monitored clinically every 3 months post-therapy for 2 years. Subgingival plaque samples were taken at the same time points from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Mean levels of each species were averaged within a subject at each visit. Significance of changes in clinical and microbiological parameters over time were evaluated using the Friedman or Wilcoxon signed ranks test. RESULTS: On average, subjects showed significant improvements in all clinical parameters after therapy. Mean (+/-SEM) full-mouth pocket depth reduction was 0.83+/-0.13 mm and mean attachment level "gain" was 0.44+/-0.12 at 24 months. Clinical improvement was accompanied by major reductions in multiple subgingival species during the first 3 months of active therapy that were maintained for most species to the last monitoring visit. Reductions occurred for three Actinomyces species, "orange complex" species including Campylobacter showae, Eubacterium nodatum, three Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, Peptostreptococcus micros, Prevotella intermedia as well as the "Streptococcus milleri" group, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus and Streptococcus intermedus. Subjects differed in their response to therapy; six modest response subjects exhibited less attachment level gain and were characterized by reductions in the microbiota from baseline to 3 months, but re-growth of many species thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: The combined antibacterial therapy was successful in controlling disease progression in 14 "refractory" periodontitis subjects for 2 years.
TI  - Streptococcus milleri group bacteraemia in North Yorkshire, England (1989-2000).
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Though carriage and local infection with organisms of the Streptococcus milleri group (SMG) are regular in clinical practice, bacteraemia is infrequent in man. The objective of the present study was to give an account of our experience with the SMG bacteraemia over a period of 12 yr in North Yorkshire. METHODS: The laboratory and clinical records of all clinically significant cases of SMG bacteraemia in our district general hospital catchment (combined population 260,000) were reviewed for the 12 yr period from 1989 to 2000. Viable isolates were recovered, species identified, and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determined. RESULTS: Twenty nine episodes of infection gave an annual incidence of 0.93 cases per 100,000 population. Infections included abscess, pneumonia, septic arthritis, genital and urinary tract infections, endocarditis and diffuse septicaemia. Patient ages ranged from 18 to 90 yr but most patients were elderly, 82 per cent had evident predisposing conditions and mortality rate was 10 per cent. Species determination of the 22 isolates showed S. anginosus (64%), S. constellatus (27%) and S. intermedius (9%). Nearly all isolates were non-haemolytic and Lancefield grouping showed carriage of the F antigen (in 41%), C (14%) and no detected group (45%). Most of the isolates were susceptible to the antimicrobials tested. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Bacteraemia with SMG organisms was infrequent, often opportunistic and featured a low overall mortality rate. Intra-abdominal sepsis was the local feature in 16 (55%) of the patients and 9 (31%) of the total patient group showed abscess or empyema. There was a low rate of antibiotic resistance in these organisms from bloodstream infection.
TI  - Identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci by sequence analysis of the 16S-23S ribosomal DNA spacer region.
AB  - The feasibility of sequence analysis of the 16S-23S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) intergenic spacer (ITS) for the identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci (VS) was evaluated. The ITS regions of 29 reference strains (11 species) of VS were amplified by PCR and sequenced. These 11 species were Streptococcus anginosus, S. constellatus, S. gordonii, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguinis, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis, and S. uberis. The ITS lengths (246 to 391 bp) and sequences were highly conserved among strains within a species. The intraspecies similarity scores for the ITS sequences ranged from 0.98 to 1.0, except for the score for S. gordonii strains. The interspecies similarity scores for the ITS sequences varied from 0.31 to 0.93. Phylogenetic analysis of the ITS regions revealed that evolution of the regions of some species of VS is not parallel to that of the 16S rRNA genes. One hundred six clinical isolates of VS were identified by the Rapid ID 32 STREP system (bioMerieux Vitek, Marcy l'Etoile, France) and by ITS sequencing, and the level of disagreement between the two methods was 18% (19 isolates). Most isolates producing discrepant results could be unambiguously assigned to a specific species by their ITS sequences. The accuracy of using ITS sequencing for identification of VS was verified by 16S rDNA sequencing for all strains except strains of S. oralis and S. mitis, which were difficult to differentiate by their 16S rDNA sequences. In conclusion, identification of species of VS by ITS sequencing is reliable and could be used as an alternative accurate method for identification of VS.
TI  - Identification of the anginosus group within the genus Streptococcus using polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - The aim of this study was to establish an identification method for the anginosus group within the genus Streptococcus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Using a primer pair based on the group-specific sequences of penicillin-binding protein 2B (pbp2b) gene, a 275-bp fragment was amplified from each species in the group but no size-matched products were obtained in other streptococci. Further identification in the species or subspecies level was possible by a multiplex PCR with primers for the 16S ribosomal RNA gene of Streptococcus anginosus, the hyaluronate lyase genes both of Streptococcus intermedius and Streptococcus constellatus subsp. constellatus, and the intermedilysin (ily) gene of S. intermedius. In the case ofStreptococcus constellatus subsp. pharyngis, the amplified fragment from the S. intermedius-type hyaluronate lyase gene was obtained, while that from the ily gene was not. These results also indicate that two different hyaluronate lyase genes are distributed among the anginosus group.
TI  - "Streptococcus milleri" endocarditis caused by Streptococcus anginosus.
AB  - Unlike other viridans streptococci, members of the "Streptococcus milleri group"  are often associated with abscess formation, but are only rare causes of infective endocarditis. Although it has been shown that almost all S. intermedius isolates and most S. constellatus isolates, but only 19% of S. anginosus isolates, were associated with abscess formation, no report has addressed the relative importance of the 3 species of the "S. milleri group" in infective endocarditis. During a 5-year period (April 1997 through March 2002), 6 cases of "S. milleri" endocarditis (out of 377 cases of infective endocarditis), that fulfil the Duke's criteria for the diagnosis of infective endocarditis, were encountered. All 6 "S. milleri" isolates were identified as S. anginosus by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing. Three patients had underlying chronic rheumatic heart disease and 1 was an IV drug abuser. Five had monomicrobial bacteremia, and 1 had polymicrobial (S. anginosus, S. mitis, Granulicatella adiacens, and Slackia exigua) bacteremia. Two patients died. None of the 6 isolates were identified by the Vitek system (GPI) or the API system (20 STREP) at >95% confidence. All 6 isolates were sensitive to penicillin G (MIC 0.008-0.064 microg/mL), cefalothin, erythromycin, clindamycin, and vancomycin. Accurate identification to the species level, by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, in cases of bacteremia caused by members of the "S. milleri group", would have direct implication on the underlying disease process, hence guiding diagnosis and treatment. Infective endocarditis should be actively looked for in cases of monomicrobial S. anginosus bacteremia, especially if the organism is recovered in multiple blood cultures.
TI  - The acid-tolerant microbiota associated with plaque from initial caries and healthy tooth surfaces.
AB  - The intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. Plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. In addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to pH 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. The results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at pH 5.5 and 1% at pH 5.0, pH values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. At pH 5.0, members of the genus Streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. The other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus gordinii, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus salivarius and SStreptococcus sanguis. Analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.
TI  - Genotyping by amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis reveals persistence and recurrence of infection with Streptococcus anginosus group organisms.
AB  - Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, and Streptococcus intermedius, commonly referred to as the Streptococcus anginosus group (SAG), are commensal organisms known for their propensity to cause purulent infections which are difficult to eradicate. In this study, we determined the genetic similarities between SAG isolates consecutively recovered from single patients to assess the duration of infection or colonization. A total of 97 SAG isolates recovered from 30 patients were included; 65 (67.0%) of the isolates were abscess related. The isolates were identified by the 16S rRNA reverse line blot hybridization assay as S. anginosus (n = 34), S. constellatus (n = 55), and S. intermedius (n = 8). Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis of the SAG isolates produced discriminatory and reproducible patterns. Consecutive SAG isolates with identical AFLP types were found in 27 of 30 (90.0%) patients, and consecutive isolates with only a single AFLP type were demonstrated in 21 (70.0%) patients. The median delay between the times of recovery of the first and last isolates of identical AFLP types from each patient was 36 days, and this delay extended for more than 1 year in patients with both colonizing and abscess-related SAG isolates. In six bacteremic patients, paired blood and nonblood SAG isolates showed identical AFLP types.
TI  - groESL sequence determination, phylogenetic analysis, and species differentiation for viridans group streptococci.
AB  - The full-length sequences of the groESL genes (also known as cpn10/60) of Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus gordonii, and Streptococcus sanguis and the near full-length sequence of the groESL genes of Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus salivarius were determined. The lengths of the groES genes from the 10 species listed above ranged from 282 to 288 bp, and the full-length sequences of groEL determined for 4 species (S. anginosus, S. constellatus, S. gordonii, and S. sanguis) revealed that each was 1,623 bp. The intergenic region (spacer) between the groES and groEL genes varies in size (15 to 111 bp) and sequence between species. The variation of the groES sequences among the species tested was greater (62.1 to 95.1% nucleotide sequence identities) than that of the groEL sequences (77.2 to 95.2% nucleotide sequence identities). Phylogenetic analysis of the groES and groEL genes yielded evolutionary trees similar to the tree constructed by use of the 16S rRNA gene. The intraspecies variation of the spacer was minimal for clinical isolates of some species. The groESL sequence data provide an additional parameter for identification of viridans group streptococcal species.
TI  - Identification of viridans streptococcal species causing bacterial meningitis in  adults in Taiwan.
AB  - In order to determine the species responsible for viridans-group streptococcal meningitis in adults in Taiwan, seven cases of culture-proven meningitis due to these organisms were studied. The cases were all identified at the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital-Kaohsiung over a period of 3 years, and they accounted for 9% (7/78) of all cases of culture-proven bacterial meningitis occurring in adults during this period. Of the seven viridans streptococci isolates recovered, Streptococcus constellatus accounted for four, Streptococcus anginosus for two, and Streptococcus oralis for one. Thus, it appears that streptococci of the milleri group are the most common species causing bacterial meningitis in adults in Taiwan. The tendency for these organisms to cause invasive central nervous system infections in adults should not be overlooked when these species are recovered from cerebrospinal fluid specimens.
TI  - Actinomyces species, streptococci, and Enterococcus faecalis in primary root canal infections.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of Actinomyces species,  streptococci, and Enterococcus faecalis in primary root canal infections by using a molecular genetic method. Samples were obtained from 53 infected teeth, of which 27 cases were diagnosed as acute periradicular abscesses. DNA was extracted to evaluate the occurrence of 13 bacterial species by using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Polymerase chain reaction using an ubiquitous bacterial primer was undertaken to check the presence of bacterial DNA in clinical samples. All root canal samples contained bacteria as demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction. The checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization assay allowed the detection of streptococci in 22.6% of the samples, Actinomyces species in 9.4%, and E. faecalis in 7.5%. The most prevalent species were members of the Streptococcus anginosus group. With regard to the asymptomatic lesions, the most prevalent species were S. intermedius (11.5% of the cases), E. faecalis (11.5%), and S. anginosus (7.7%). S. constellatus was the most prevalent species in pus samples (25.9% of the cases). The other most prevalent species in abscessed teeth were A. gerencseriae (14.8%), S. gordonii (11.1%), S. intermedius (11.1%), A. israelii (7.4%), S. anginosus (7.4%), and S. sanguis (7.4%). S. constellatus was the only species positively associated with acute periradicular abscess (p < 0.01).
TI  - [A three-year review of acute respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus milleri group].
AB  - The objective of our study is to understand the clinical features of patients with acute respiratory tract infection associated with Streptococcus milleri group (SMG). Fifteen patients with SMG respiratory tract infection visited our hospital from July, 1997 through May, 2000. There were seven cases of pneumonia, two pulmonary abscess, three thoracic empyema and three acute bronchitis. The mean age of the patients was 57.8 years (range 16-87), twelve were males, and seven were smokers. The moderately to severe underlying diseases existed in thirteen patients (86.7%) and included the following: respiratory diseases (20.0%), history of the esophageal or gastric surgery (26.7%), central nerve system diseases (13.3%), alcohol intake (60.0%), hepatitis and pancreatitis (33.3%), diabetes mellitus (13.3%) and malignancy (6.7%). The species of SMG detected were as follows: S. constellatus, 8, S. anginosus, 6 and S. intermedius, 1. Anaerobic organism and other microorganisms were detected in five patients. A patient with SMG nosocominal pneumonia who previously had thoracic surgery for esophageal cancer died. Antibiotics therapy with carbapenem or combination therapy, drainage and no surgery, were successful in 14 of the 15 cases (93.3%). The number of intermediately or complete resistant strains against penicillin G, ampicillin and cefmetazole were 5 (33.3%), 8 (53.3%) and 12 (80.0%), respectively in this series. Recently, it is seemed that acute respiratory tract infections caused by SMG are increasing in the patients with moderately to severe underlying diseases, and several clinical strains of SMG are acquiring a tolerance to antibiotics.
TI  - Streptococcus sinensis sp. nov., a novel species isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis.
AB  - A bacterium was isolated from the blood culture of a patient with infective endocarditis. The cells were facultative anaerobic, nonsporulating, gram-positive cocci arranged in chains. The bacterium grows on sheep blood agar as alpha-hemolytic, gray colonies of 0.5 to 1 mm in diameter after 24 h of incubation at 37 degrees C in ambient air. Growth also occurs in 10 or 40% bile and on bile esculin agar but not in 6% NaCl. No enhancement of growth is observed in 5% CO(2). It is nongroupable with Lancefield groups A, B, C, D, F, or G antisera and is resistant to optochin and bacitracin. The organism is aflagellated and is nonmotile at both 25 and 37 degrees C. It is Voges-Proskauer test positive. It produces leucine arylamidase and beta-glucosidase but not catalase, urease, lysine decarboxylase, or ornithine decarboxylase. It hydrolyzes esculin and arginine. It utilizes glucose, lactose, salicin, sucrose, pullulan, trehalose, cellobiose, hemicellulase, mannose, maltose, and starch. 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that there were 3.6, 3.7, 4.3, 4.7, and 5.9% differences between the 16S rRNA gene sequence of the bacterium and those of Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus anginosus, respectively. The G+C content of it (mean plus minus standard deviation) was 53.0% plus minus 2.9%. Based on phylogenetic affiliation, it belongs to the mitis or anginosus group of Streptococcus. For these reasons a new species, Streptococcus sinensis sp. nov., is proposed, for which HKU4 is the type strain. Further studies should be performed to ascertain the potential of this bacterium to become an emerging cause of infective endocarditis.
TI  - Rapid identification of Streptococcus intermedius by PCR with the ily gene as a species marker gene.
AB  - Streptococcus intermedius belongs to the anginosus group of streptococci (AGS) and is associated with endogenous infections leading to abscesses in the oral cavity and at deepseated sites, such as the brain and liver. Two other species, S. anginosus and S. constellatus, and some presently unnamed taxa, are also classified as AGS. Recently, S. constellatus subsp. pharyngis, a new subspecies with biochemical characteristics similar to S. intermedius, was described with the potential for causing confusion when trying to identify isolates of these two species routinely with commercial identification kits, such as Rapid ID32 Strep and Fluo-Card Milleri. To correctly identify S. intermedius, this study attempted to develop an accurate PCR identification system with the ily gene as a species marker. This approach relies on amplification of an 819-bp fragment of the ily gene and its 3'-flanking region and is shown here to be specific for S. intermedius strains among all other streptococcal species. Moreover, this PCR system was applicable in direct rapid PCR with whole bacterial cells and TaKaRa Z-Taq (TaKaRa), a highly efficient DNA polymerase, as the template and DNA amplification enzyme, respectively.
TI  - [Clinical relevance of the Streptococcus milleri group in head and neck infections].
AB  - Streptococcus constellatus, S. intermedius, and S. anginosus, the 3 species of the S. milleri group, form part of the normal flora commonly found in the mouth, throat, and gastrointestinal and genital tracts. This group has become known as an important pathogen in infections and abscesses, but data on the anatomical distribution of these species is lacking in relation to clinical significance. We obtained 275 strains of the S. milleri group from different departments at our hospital over the last 3 years, including 54 strains from dental surgery, 47 from internal medicine, 44 from otolaryngology (head and neck), 43 from surgery, 32 from gynecology, 17 from urology, 16 from dermatology, 11 from brain surgery, 6 from pediatrics, 3 from orthopedics, and 2 from opthalmology. The 44 strains from head and neck were found in 42 patients,--23 with primary infection and 19 with secondary infection induced by cancer treatments. The primary infection group included 4 deep neck abscesses, 1 peritonsillar abscess, 5 tonsillitis, 4 paranasal sinusitis, 3 congenital aural fistula infections, 2 dental infections, 2 paranasal sinus cysts, 1 supprative parotitis, and 1 postoperative wound infection. The secondary infection group included 7 postoperative wound infections, 3 postoperative pulmonary infections, 3 laryngitis and pharyngitis, 3 terminal pneumonias, and 3 infections of the local recurrence site. The S. milleri group was the only isolated organism in 13 cases (56.5%) of primary infection and in 5 (26.3%) of secondary infection. Among other organisms from the primary infection group, no so-called major pathogens were found. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests of the S. milleri group showed that 50% were resistant to CCL and 33% to CTM. ABPC, CPDX, and CFDN were also found to be less sensitive, although no resistant strains were detected. To adequately culture the S. milleri group, incubation in air containing carbon dioxide or in an anaerobic atmosphere is required, and differentiation of the 3 requires biochemical reactivity tests. Since not all facilities use identical techniques in routine bacteriological examination, a considerable number of the S. milleri group could be missed in unknown species of alpha-,beta-, and gamma-streptococci and culture-negative cases. With antibiotics now being used widely, normal flora such as the S. milleri group may have become an important pathogen in head and neck infections due to an imbalance between organisms and host defense.
TI  - Streptococci species of anginosus group isolated from oral and maxillofacial infections.
AB  - The aim of the study was to isolate and identify at species level streptococci strains of anginosus group in pus samples collected from 110 patients with oral and maxillofacial (OMF) infections. Gram-stained smears and cultures on selective and nonselective media were done from each of the 111 pus samples (2 samples were collected from one of the patients, who presented 2 oral abscesses at the same time). The isolates were identified on the basis of cultural and biochemical characteristics. Speciation of the anginosus group isolates was performed using the Rapid ID 32 Strep system (Bio Merieux, France). Fourty-four anginosus group strains were isolated from 42 patients. Fourty of these isolates were identified as Streptococcus anginosus (2 nonidentical isolates were found in 2 patients), 3 isolates as Streptococcus constellatus and only one as Streptococcus intermedius. The study confirmed that the anginosus group is often involved in OMF infections alone or in association with other aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria. In the investigated cases, Streptococcus anginosus was by far the most frequently isolated species within the anginosus group.
TI  - Interaction between human polymorphonuclear leukocytes and Streptococcus milleri  group bacteria.
AB  - Because Streptococcus milleri group (SMG) bacteria--Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus intermedius, and Streptococcus anginosus--exhibit a striking propensity to cause abscesses, the interaction of these organisms with human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) was examined. After incubation in pooled normal human serum, SMG stimulated less chemotaxis than did Staphylococcus aureus, in contrast to viridans streptococci, which caused greater chemotaxis than did S. aureus. PMNL ingested greater numbers of SMG and viridans streptococci than S. aureus but killed these organisms more slowly and less completely. Relative resistance to killing by PMNL is expected in organisms that cause abscesses, and inhibition of chemotaxis may contribute to pathogenicity, because delayed arrival of PMNL gives a head start to proliferating bacteria. This study helps explain the capacity of SMG to cause abscesses. It is unclear, however, why viridans streptococci, bacteria that rarely produce abscesses, share some of these same properties.
TI  - [Clinical significance of the Streptococcus milleri group in peritonsillar abscesses].
AB  - Few researchers have microbiologically studied peritonsillar abscesses in detail, and their results have been conflicting. Although Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A beta-streptococcus) is commonly considered an important pathogen in this infection, recent studies have demonstrated the recovery of many other streptococci mainly consisting of alpha-streptococci. Few studies have identified these streptococci at the species level, however. We studied details of bacteriology in 31 cases of peritonsillar abscess treated between 1991 and 2000. The Streptococcus milleri group was most frequently isolated (25.8%), followed by Eikenella corrodens (9.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (6.5%), and S. pyogenes (3.2%). The S. milleri group, consisting of 3 species of Streptococcus constellatus, S. intermedius, and S. anginosus, forms part of the normal flora most commonly found in the mouth, throat, gastrointestinal tract, and genital tract. These species have become known as an important pathogen in abscess disease but little attention has been paid to their role in peritonsillar abscesses. To adequately culture the S. milleri group, incubation in air containing carbon dioxide or in an anaerobic condition is required, and then the differentiation of the 3 species requires the biochemical reactivity tests. Since hemolytic patterns of the S. milleri group vary, we studied the population of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-hemolytic strains among 36 strains of this group. We found 32 (88.8%) to be alpha-hemolytic. Although not all alpha-hemolytic strains belong to the S. milleri group, a considerable number of this group could be missed among alpha-streptococci isolated from the peritonsillar abscess. As antibiotics began being used widely, normal flora such as the S. milleri group may have become an important pathogen in peritonsillar abscesses due to an imbalance between organisms and host defense.
TI  - Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus constellatus, and Streptococcus anginosus ("Streptococcus milleri group") are of different clinical importance and are not equally associated with abscess.
AB  - Difficulties in distinguishing organisms of the "Streptococcus milleri group" (SMG; Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus constellatus, and Streptococcus anginosus), have caused ambiguity in determining their pathogenic potential. We reviewed 118 cases in which SMG isolates had been identified using 16S rDNA sequence. S. constellatus and S. anginosus were isolated far more frequently than was S. intermedius. Nearly all isolates of S. intermedius and most isolates of S. constellatus, but only 19% of those of S. anginosus, were associated with abscess. Our findings suggest that speciation of the SMG may guide diagnostic evaluation, give insight into the possible role of coinfecting organisms, and help assess the need to search for occult abscess.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibilities of genetically characterized Streptococcus milleri group strains.
AB  - Previous studies of the antibiotic susceptibility of Streptococcus milleri group  organisms have distinguished among species by using phenotypic techniques. Using 44 isolates that were speciated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we studied the MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations of penicillin, ampicillin, ceftriaxone, and clindamycin for Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus constellatus, and Streptococcus anginosus. None of the organisms was resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics, although a few isolates were intermediately resistant; one strain of S. anginosus was tolerant to ampicillin, and another was tolerant to ceftriaxone. Six isolates were resistant to clindamycin, with representation from each of the three species. Relatively small differences in antibiotic susceptibilities among species of the S. milleri group show that speciation is unlikely to be important in selecting an antibiotic to treat infection caused by one of these isolates.
TI  - [Clinical and bacteriological significance of the Streptococcus milleri group in  deep neck abscesses].
AB  - Streptococcus constellatus, S. intermedius, and S. anginosus, the three species of the S. milleri group, form part of the normal flora most commonly found in the mouth, throat, gastrointenstinal tract, and genital tract. The S. milleri group has become known as an important pathogen in abscess disease, but little attention has been paid to their role in deep neck abscesses. We have treated 9 patients with deep neck abscesses relating to the S. milleri group since 1991, and regarded this group as an important pathogen also in these abscesses. We studied the frequency of the S. milleri group isolated from deep neck abscesses in our cases and from the literature and discuss clinical significance and bacteriological pathogenesis. Cases numbered 27 treated at our facility since 1991 and 200 cases reported in the Japanese literature since 1990. Of our 9 cases, 4 originated from acute pharyngitis, 3 from peritonsillar abscesses, and 2 from odontogenic infection. Serious complications such as mediastinitis, cervical necrotizing fasciitis, sepsis accompanied by disseminated intravascular coagulation, and spondylitis of the cervical vertebrae were seen in 4 cases. Among organisms isolated, the S. milleri group appeared to be a pathogen contributing to abscess formation and to serious complications. The genus Streptococcus was most frequently isolated both in our 27 cases (66.7%) and the 200 in the literature (45.5%). Among species of the genus Streptococcus, the S. milleri group numbered the highest in our cases at 33.3% but only 8.5% in the literature. Cases in the literature, however, contained many unknown species of Streptococci--31.5% vs. 18.5% in our cases. alpha-streptococcus was frequently reported in the literature among unknown species of Streptococci--36 of 63. Culture-negative cases were also numbered more in the literature than in our case--29.0% vs. 18.5%. Special conditions and procedures are required to suitably isolate and detect the S. milleri group. Since not all facilities use identical techniques in routine bacteriological examination, a considerable number of the S. milleri group could be missed in unknown species of Streptococci or alpha-streptococcus and culture-negative cases. The detailed pathogenesis of the S. milleri group remains to be clarified. Infection by normal flora on mucosa is thought to occur due to an imbalance between organisms and host defense in deep neck abscesses. Some strains of the S. milleri group have been reported to produce many tissue-destroying enzymes such as collagenase and hyaluronidase. The co-existence of the S. milleri group with some anaerobe strains has also been suggested to accelerate inflammation. We discuss the mechanism inducing the massive release of cytokines through T cell response to certain exotoxins produced by S. milleri group, as reported in toxic shock-like syndrome due to the group A beta-streptococcus and in alpha-streptococcal shock syndrome due to viridans streptococci (alpha-streptococci).
TI  - Strain-related acid production by oral streptococci.
AB  - Acid production, in particular at low pH, is thought to be an important ecological determinant in dental caries. The aim of the present study was to determine the acid producing capability at different pH levels of 47 streptococcal strains, representing 9 species, isolated from human dental plaque. The bacteria were grown until mid log-phase under anaerobic conditions and acid production was measured in a pH-stat system at pH 7.0, 6.0, 5.5 and 5.0. At all pH values, the mean velocity of acid production (V(ap)) by Streptococcus mutans and S. sobrinus was significantly higher (p<0.01; ANOVA) than that of the other oral streptococci, including S. mitis, S. oralis, S. gordonii, S. sanguis, S. intermedius, S. anginosus, S. constellatus, and S. vestibularis. However, the V(ap) of some strains of S. mitis biovar 1 and S. oralis, particularly at pH values of 7.0 and 6.0, exceeded that of some strains of S. mutans. The V(ap) decreased with pH for all strains, but some strains of S. mitis biovar 1 and strains of the mutans streptococci maintained a relatively high rate of acid production. The results suggest that some strains of S. mitis biovar 1 and S. oralis may play an important role in caries development by modifying the environment in dental plaque to become favourable for the succession of aciduric species. The study furthermore emphasises the need for detailed species and biovar identification of oral streptococci and for recognition of the significant physiological differences that occur within single species.
TI  - DNA-DNA reassociation studies of Streptococcus constellatus with unusual 16S rRNA sequences.
AB  - DNA-DNA reassociation studies were performed on previously described 'CI strains', which form an unusual 16S rRNA population within the 'anginosus' group of Streptococcus. The CI strains displayed reassociation values of >70% with the Streptococcus constellatus NCDO 2226T strain, with Tm values <1 degrees C, indicating phylogenetic species identity.
TI  - Comparison of three methods for identification of Streptococcus milleri group isolates to species level.
AB  - A collection of 180 clinical isolates of Streptococcus milleri group were identified to species level using two phenotypic methods (a commercial system and the reference method based on differential phenotypic reactions) and a genotypic method (hybridisation of the 16S rRNA gene with species-specific probes) in order to evaluate the performance of the respective methods. A high level of agreement (80%) was observed between the results of the reference method and the genotypic method. The highest level of agreement was found for the species Streptococcus anginosus (83%), a high level of agreement (76%) also being achieved for Streptococcus constellatus and Streptococcus intermedius. The sensitivity of the commercial system compared to the genotypic method was 76% overall, but it was low (57.5%) for Streptococcus intermedius. Twenty-five strains belonged to the recently described CI strains.
TI  - Distribution of the intermedilysin gene among the anginosus group streptococci and correlation between intermedilysin production and deep-seated infection with Streptococcus intermedius.
AB  - The distribution of intermedilysin, a human-specific cytolysin, among the anginosus group streptococci and the correlation of toxin production and infection by Streptococcus intermedius were investigated. PCR and Southern hybridization specific for the intermedilysin gene revealed that the toxin gene exists only in S. intermedius and no homologue to the toxin gene is distributed in S. anginosus and S. constellatus. Thus, the intermedilysin gene is useful as a marker gene of S. intermedius. Moreover, a human-specific hemolysis assay and Western blotting with intermedilysin-specific antibodies clearly demonstrated that the intermedilysin production level in isolates from deep-seated infections, such as brain and liver abscesses, is higher (6.2- to 10.2-fold, respectively) than in strains from normal habitats, such as dental plaque, or from peripheral infection sites. However, other candidate virulence factors of S. intermedius, such as chondroitin sulfate depolymerase, hyaluronidase, and sialidase activities, did not show such a clear correlation between enzymatic activity and isolation sites or disease severity. From these results, intermedilysin is likely to be the pathogenic or triggering factor of significance in inducing deep-seated infections with S. intermedius.
TI  - Systemic doxycycline administration in the treatment of periodontal infections (II). Effect on antibiotic resistance of subgingival species.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to determine the proportion and prevalence  of doxycycline resistant species in subgingival plaque samples taken during and after doxycycline administration. 20 subjects with adult periodontitis were randomly assigned to test (n = 10) or control groups (n = 10). Saliva samples as well as subgingival plaque samples taken from the distal surface of 6 posterior teeth were collected at baseline. All subjects received full mouth SRP and the test group systemic doxycycline at the dosage of 100 mg/day for 14 days. Saliva samples and plaque samples from the distal surface of 2 randomly selected teeth were taken at 3, 7 and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. Control subjects were sampled at the same time points. Samples were anaerobically dispersed and serially diluted in PRAS Ringer's solution and plated on enriched Trypticase soy blood agar plates with or without 4 microg/ml doxycycline. After 7 days of anaerobic incubation, colonies were counted on both sets of plates. Microbial growth was washed from the doxycycline-containing media and the species identified using 40 DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Differences in proportions of resistant species between test and control groups were tested for significance at each time point using the Mann Whitney test and over time within each group using the Quade test. The mean % (+/-SEM) of isolates resistant to 4 microg/ml doxycycline in the plaque samples of the test subjects increased from 6+/-2 to 48+/-9% during doxycycline administration, decreasing to 25+/-6% 2 weeks later and 9+/-2% at 90 days. In saliva, the % of resistant isolates rose from 13+/-1% to 81+/-10% during doxycycline administration falling to 46+/-8% 2 weeks later and 22+/-5% at 90 days. The % of resistant isolates did not change significantly in plaque or saliva samples of the control subjects at the same time points. For all subject visits combined, the most prevalent resistant species were: Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Veillonella parvula, Actinomyces gerencseriae, Streptococcus constellatus, Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, Streptococcus gordonii, Eikenella corrodens and Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1. Doxycycline resistant strains of these species were detected in both plaque and saliva samples prior to therapy and in the control group. Despite the finding of increased resistance, approximately 50% of the organisms present at periodontal sites at the end of 14 days of doxycycline administration tested sensitive to the agent.
TI  - Identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by analysis of transfer DNA intergenic spacer length polymorphism.
AB  - The utility of PCR analysis of transfer DNA intergenic spacer length polymorphism (tDNA-ILP) for the identification to the species level of clinically relevant viridans streptococci was evaluated with a collection of reference strains of 15 species of the salivarius, anginosus, mitis and mutans rRNA homology groups. PCR products generated by using fluorescent, outwardly directed, consensus tDNA primers were analysed by electrophoresis on denaturating polyacrylamide gels and by laser fluorescence scanning. Eleven species showed specific and distinct tDNA patterns: Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus criceti and Streptococcus ratti. Indistinguishable patterns were obtained among two groups of species: Streptococcus vestibularis and Streptococcus salivarius on the one hand and Streptococcus constellatus and Streptococcus intermedius on the other. S. mitis strains produced heterogeneous patterns that could be separated into three groups: a group containing S. mitis biovar 1 and two S. mitis biovar 2 groups, one of which clustered with S. parasanguinis strains while the other showed patterns unrelated to other species. These results agree in part with protein electrophoretic analysis showing that S. mitis biovar 2 strains belong to several streptococcal taxa. In conclusion, PCR analysis of tDNA-ILP holds promise for rapid identification of viridans streptococci that are difficult to identify by phenotypic tests.
TI  - A study of small-colony, beta-haemolytic, Lancefield group C streptococci within  the anginosus group: description of Streptococcus constellatus subsp. pharyngis subsp. nov., associated with the human throat and pharyngitis.
AB  - beta-Haemolytic, Lancefield group C streptococci within the anginosus-species group were shown by genetic and phenotypic criteria to be heterogeneous and to constitute two distinct taxa related at subspecies level to Streptococcus constellatus and Streptococcus anginosus, respectively. The first group, referred to here as DNA group 1, comprised six strains with 86-100% intragroup overall genomic DNA relatedness; five of the strains were originally isolated from the human throat and one was from an abdominal mass. They shared 61-77% DNA relatedness (delta Tm values = 1.2-1.5 degrees C) with reference strains of S. constellatus and were clearly differentiated from S. constellatus (now named Streptococcus constellatus subsp. constellatus) by the ability to produce beta-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, beta-D-fucosidase, beta-D-galactosidase and beta-D-glucosidase. The name S. constellatus subsp. pharyngis is proposed for these strains on the grounds that they are genetically and phenotypically distinct and exhibit a predeliction for the human throat, being isolated also from cases of pharyngitis. The DNA G + C content is 35-37 mol%. The type strain is MM9889aT (= NCTC 13122T). The second group (DNA group 2) was formed by five beta-haemolytic, Lancefield group C strains originally isolated from various human infections. DNA group 2 strains (81-100% intragroup DNA relatedness) shared 60-72% DNA relatedness (delta Tm values = 2.1-4.1 degrees C) with S. anginosus strains NCTC 10713T and MAS 283 but were not clearly differentiated phenotypically from S. anginosus, showed no clear pattern of clinical association, and therefore are not formally proposed as a new subspecies here.
TI  - Genotypic and phenotypic characterization of "Streptococcus milleri" group isolates from a Veterans Administration hospital population.
AB  - Because identification of the species within the "Streptococcus milleri" group is difficult for the clinical laboratory as the species share overlapping phenotypic characteristics, we wished to confirm biochemical identification with identification by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Ninety-four clinical isolates previously identified as the "Streptococcus milleri" group were reclassified as S. anginosus, S. constellatus, or S. intermedius with the API 20 Strep system (bioMerieux Vikek, Hazelton, Mo.) and the Fluo-card (Key Scientific, Round Rock, Tex.). In addition, we determined the Lancefield group, hemolysis, colony size, colony texture, repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR (rep-PCR) pattern, and cellular fatty acid (CFA) profile (MIDI, Newark, Del.). 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis with 40 selected representative strains showed three distinct groups, with S. constellatus and S. intermedius found to be more closely related to each other than to S. anginosus, and further distinguished a biochemically distinct group of urogenital isolates within the S. anginosus group of isolates. Except for strains unreactive with the Fluo-card (8%), all S. anginosus and S. intermedius strains identified by sequencing were similarly identified by biochemical testing. However, 23% of the selected S. constellatus isolates identified by sequencing (9% of all S. constellatus isolates) would have been identified as S. anginosus or S. intermedius by biochemical tests. Although most S. anginosus strains formed one unique cluster by CFA analysis and most S. constellatus strains showed similar rep-PCR patterns, neither method was sufficiently dependable for identification. Whereas Lancefield group or lactose fermentation did not correspond to sequence or biochemical type, S. constellatus was most likely to be beta-hemolytic and S. intermedius was most likely to have a dry colony type. The most frequent isolate in our population was S. constellatus, followed by S. anginosus. There was an association of S. anginosus with a gastrointestinal or urogenital source, and there was an association of S. constellatus and S. intermedius with both the respiratory tract and upper-body abscesses.
TI  - Five-year analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility of the Streptococcus milleri group.
AB  - Susceptibility to 17 antibiotics was studied in 180 strains of the Streptococcus  milleri group (88 Streptococcus anginosus, 63 Streptococcus constellatus, and 29 Streptococcus intermedius) isolated over a 5-year period. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of penicillin were in the intermediate range for 5.6% of the strains. Resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin was found in 17.1% and 16.6% of the isolates, respectively. A steady increase in the susceptibility to ciprofloxacin was observed over the study period. Imipenem was the most active beta-lactam agent tested. Glycopeptide antibiotics showed excellent activity. Only slight differences between the three species were found in terms of antibiotic susceptibility. Intermediate resistance to penicillin is appearing among the Streptococcus milleri group in our area; consequently, care must be taken when choosing a macrolide for the management of infections caused by these microorganisms.
TI  - Effect of low-molecular-weight chitosans on the adhesive properties of oral streptococci.
AB  - It was previously shown that a low-molecular-weight chitosan and its derivatives  N-carboxymethyl chitosan and imidazolyl chitosan inhibit Streptococcus mutans adsorption to hydroxyapatite. The ability of the same molecules to interfere with adhesive properties of other oral streptococci (Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus vestibularis) was tested. When saliva-coated or -uncoated hydroxyapatite beads were treated with N-carboxymethyl chitosan, a reduction varying from 60% to 98% depending on strains was observed. Low-molecular-weight chitosans and imidazolyl chitosan did not have any effect. Growth in N-carboxymethyl chitosan-supplemented medium (final concentrations ranging from 20 to 500 micrograms.ml-1) caused a dose related reduction in the adsorption of all strains to hydroxyapatite and in their affinity towards xylene. No effect was observed with low-molecular-weight chitosans and imidazolyl chitosan. In contrast to what observed with S. mutans, the three polysaccharides did not affect detachment from hydroxyapatite beads and adherence to cheek epithelial cells of the other streptococci. These results suggest that low-molecular-weight chitosans and/or imidazolyl chitosan, selectively affecting S. mutans adsorption to hydroxyapatite, may be very interesting as potential anti-dental caries agents.
TI  - [Evaluation of Fluo-Card Milleri to Identify the Isolates of Streptococcus milleri Group: Comparative Identication with Referral Fluorogenic Phenotypic Dierentiation]
AB  - Clinical isolates which belong to the "Streptococcus milleri" group were identied by the referral uorogenic phenotypic tests described by Whiley et al. [J. Clin. Microbiol., 28: 1497-1501 (1990)] and a rapid, commercially available test kits; Fluo-Card Milleri (KEY Scientific Products, Round Rock, Tex., U.S.A.) to the species level. Of 218 clinical isolates included, 196 (89.9%) were correctly identied by the Fluo-Card Milleri when compared with the reference identications. Ten isolates (4.6%) of S. constellatus resulted in the "unidentied" due to the negative interpretations for all the three enzymatic reactions. A total of twelve isolates (5.5%); five of S. anginosus, five of S. constellatus, and two of S. intermedius, were misidentied. The levels of agreement were 95.7% for S. anginosus, 91.3% for S. intermedius, and 92.6% for S. constellatus when the unidentied results were excluded.
TI  - Nonclostridial gas gangrene due to Streptococcus anginosus in a diabetic patient.
AB  - Streptococcus anginosus was recently identified as a distinct species from the other members of Streptococcus milleri group (Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus intermedius). We report a rare case of nonclostridial gas gangrene caused by S. anginosus. A 62-year-old diabetic woman was admitted with gas gangrene of the perineal area. She had been taking her oral hypoglycemia medication regularly for 10 years, but the diabetes was inadequately controlled. She was treated with surgical debridement of the necrotic tissue, insulin injection, and antibiotic therapy, and had a satisfactory clinical course.
TI  - Serotype variation in Streptococcus anginosus, S. constellatus and S. intermedius.
AB  - Various serotypes reported in three serotyping systems for the 'Streptococcus milleri' group, i.e., Ottens I-IV, Osano I-IV and serotypes a-k, were compared with each other in a capillary precipitation test and by the double immunodiffusion test. Only two of the 19 serotypes, f and Ottens-III, were identical, and the other 17 serotypes were independent. Thus, 18 serotypes and another three candidates (a-, b- and g-cross-reactive) were found in the 'S. milleri' group. Of the 248 strains tested, 197 were serotypable, and 23 strains carried two type antigens. Generally, the Ottens I, II, III (serotype f), IV and Osano IV antigens, often together with the Lancefield group F antigen, were found in S. anginosus and S. constellatus. In addition, the serotype a, c, d, e and k antigens with the group A, C or G antigen were distributed in S. anginosus, the serotype b antigen in S. constellatus and the g, h, i, j, Osano I, II and III antigens in S. intermedius. Twenty-five of the untypable strains were Lancefield groupable (mostly F).
TI  - Clinical significance of bacteremia involving the "Streptococcus milleri" group:  51 cases and review.
AB  - Fifty-one cases of bacteremia due to the "Streptococcus milleri" group were analyzed. Among these were 40 patients with underlying diseases, and associated local infections were present in 27 patients. The most frequent sites of infection were the thoracic cavity and the digestive and hepatobiliary tracts. A probable portal of entry related to mucosal-barrier trauma was identified for an additional 16 patients. The origin of bacteremia was unknown for the remaining eight patients. Abscess formation was evident for only six patients, and there were no cases of endocarditis. Multiple positive blood cultures and polymicrobial bacteremia were associated significantly with the presence of local sites of infection. The most common causative species were Streptococcus anginosus and Streptococcus constellatus. Two patients died of bacteremia.
TI  - Identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  - We have used a PCR assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (sodA(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (S. acidominimus, S. agalactiae, S. alactolyticus, S. anginosus, S. bovis, S. constellatus, S. canis, S. cricetus, S. downei, S. dysgalactiae, S. equi subsp. equi, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, S. equinus, S. gordonii, S. iniae, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguis, S. pneumoniae, S. porcinus, S. pyogenes, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. sobrinus, S. suis, S. thermophilus, and S. vestibularis). Phylogenetic analysis of these sodA(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16S rRNA sequences. We have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their sodA(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the sodA(int) fragments of the type species. We propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.
TI  - Experimental endocarditis induction and platelet aggregation by Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus and Streptococcus intermedius.
AB  - A total of 18 'Streptococcus milleri' strains including the ATCC type strains of  Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus and Streptococcus intermedius were compared with Streptococcus oralis ATCC10557 for their ability to induce infective endocarditis in catheterized rats. Three days after intravenous injection of 10(8) colony-forming units all 8 S. anginosus strains tested produced infective vegetations and bacteremia in almost all rats whereas 5 S. constellatus strains and the S. oralis strain produced infective vegetations and bacteremia less frequently and 5 S. intermedius strains only occasionally. The vegetations infected with the S. anginosus strains harbored microbial cells in significantly higher numbers that those with the other strains. No strong correlation was found between the endocardial infectivity and platelet-aggregating capacity of these strains. The platelet-aggregating strains were members of the Lancefield groups F and G or ungroupable but not of group A or C.
TI  - Identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci to the species  level by PCR.
AB  - A PCR assay that allows identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci (Streptococcus gordonii, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. salivarius, and S. sanguis) to the species level and identification of milleri group streptococci (S. anginosus, S. constellatus, and S. intermedius) to the group level was developed. This assay was based on specific amplification of internal fragments of genes encoding D-alanine:D-alanine ligases which are species specific and ubiquitous in prokaryotes possessing peptidoglycan. The specificity of this assay was tested on 9 reference strains and 91 characterized clinical isolates. This assay offers a specific and rapid alternative to phenotypic or DNA-DNA hybridization methods for identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci.
TI  - [Bacteremias due to the Streptococcus milleri group. An analysis of 18 episodes].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of bacteremia caused by Streptococcus milleri group streptococci (SMG). METHODS: Prospective evaluation of all bacteremic episodes with clinical significance from 1990 to 1995 in two general hospitals. In this study all episodes caused by SMG were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 905 bacteremic episodes with clinical significance were detected; 18 (1.98%) were caused by SMG (0.16/1,000 admissions). The mean age of patients were 43 years and the male/female ratio 1.6. Seventeen patients (94.4%) had some underlying disease; nine patients had diabetes, four were parenteral drug abusers, and two had neoplasms. The most common sources of bacteremia were intraabdominal in four episodes (two liver abscesses, one subphrenic abscess and one pancreatic pseudocyst), cutaneous and/or soft tissues in four, surgical wound in two and respiratory in two; no source was identified in five episodes. Four episodes had a polymicrobial origin. In 13 isolates the identification was at species level (Streptococcus anginosus eight, Streptococcus intermedius four and Streptococcus constellatus one). All strains were susceptible to penicillin. Six patients (33.3%) required surgery. In ten episodes a favorable outcome was recorded, although four patients required surgery. The infection associated mortality rate was 31.2%. The mean age of deceased patients was higher than for cured patients (62.2 +/- 20.2 versus 35.3 +/- 20.3; p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: SMB bacteremia is uncommon. It involved mainly diabetic patients or parenteral drug abusers, commonly with an intraabdominal suppurative source or in skin or soft tissues. The mortality rate was high despite surgery in one third of patients. Patients with advanced age had a poorer prognosis. All isolates investigated were susceptible to penicillin.
TI  - Characterization of the Lancefield group C streptococcus 16S-23S RNA gene intergenic spacer and its potential for identification and sub-specific typing.
AB  - The 16S-23S RNA gene intergenic spacers of isolates of Streptococcus equi (n = 5), S. zooepidemicus (n = 5), S. equisimilis (n = 3) and S. dysgalactiae (n = 2) were sequenced and compared. There were distinct regions within the spacer, arranged in the order 1-9 for all S. equi and one S. zooepidemicus isolate and 1,2 and 4-9 for the remaining isolates. Region 4 was identical to the tRNA(ala) gene found in the 16S-23S intergenic spacers of other streptococci. Regions 1, 5, 6 and 7 had distinct variations, each conserved in different isolates. However, amongst the intergenic spacers there were different combinations of variant regions, suggesting a role for DNA recombination in their evolution. The intergenic spacer of all isolates of S. equi and one S. zooepidemicus isolate were almost identical. Primers derived from the variant sequences of regions 1 and 5 to 6 were used to group all S. zooepidemicus (n = 17) and S. equi (n = 5) into 1 of 8 types by polymerase chain reaction; three S. zooepidemicus isolates typed the same as S. equi. S. equi and S. zooepidemicus were clearly distinguishable from S. equisimilis and S. dysgalactiae which had shorter regions 5 and 6 and no region 7. Most homology for the group C sequences was found in previously published sequences for the 16S-23S intergenic spacers of S. anginosis, S. constellatus, S. intermedius, S. salivarius and S. agalactiae. A 75-90 nucleotide length shared with S. anginosus and S. intermedius in opposite orientations in the two main variants of region 6 supported the role for DNA recombination in the evolution of the spacer. The 16S-23S intergenic spacers indicate that S. zooepidemicus was the archetypal species for S. equi and that both are genetically more distant from S. equisimilis and S. dysgalactiae. The intergenic spacer can be used to identify specifically the group C streptococci and as an epidemiological marker for S. zooepidemicus.
TI  - Utilization of sialic acid by viridans streptococci.
AB  - The importance of viridans streptococci as agents of serious extra-oral diseases, including endocarditis, is now recognized. We have tested the hypothesis that the ability to utilize sialic acid as a nutrient source may play a role in the proliferation of these organisms. The type strains of the 15 presently recognized species of viridans streptococci and two clinical isolates-S. oralis (AR3), isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis, and S. intermedius (UNS35), a brain abscess isolate-were studied for their ability to utilize sialic acid. Only S. oralis, S. sanguis, S. gordonii, S. mitis ("oralis group") S. intermedius, S. anginosus, S. constellatus ("milleri group"), and S. defectivus ("nutritionally variant group") were able to use sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid) efficiently as a sole carbon source. Formate, acetate, and ethanol were produced as the major metabolic end-products of sialic acid metabolism, while corresponding glucose-grown cultures produced lactate as the major metabolic end-product. Utilization of sialic acid was independent of the production of sialidase. Cell-free extracts of sialic acid-grown cultures expressed elevated levels of N-acetylneuraminate pyruvate-lyase (NPL; the first enzyme in the intracellular catabolism of sialic acid) and N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcNAc-6-P) deacetylase and glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN-6-P) deaminase (enzymes involved in the intracellular catabolism of N-acetylglucosamine). These activities were repressed by growth in the presence of glucose. The intracellular fate of sialic acid, after cleavage by NPL into N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) and pyruvate, is uncertain, but the elevated levels of GlcNAc-6-P deacetylase and GlcN-6-P deaminase in sialic acid-grown cells suggest that phosphorylation and isomerization are possible steps in the metabolism of ManNAc to generate an intermediate common to the pathway of N-acetylglucosamine metabolism. The species of viridans streptococci that have the ability to utilize sialic acid are those most commonly associated with extra-oral diseases, and this ability is likely to play a role in the persistence and survival of these infecting organisms in vivo.
TI  - Rapid species identification of "Streptococcus milleri" strains by line blot hybridization: identification of a distinct 16S rRNA population closely related to Streptococcus constellatus.
AB  - A collection of 399 "Streptococcus milleri" strains were identified to the species level by the use of a line blot assay. Their PCR-amplified partial 16S rRNA gene sequences were hybridized with species-specific 5'-biotinylated oligonucleotide probes homologous to the bp 213 to 231 regions of the 16S rRNA gene sequences of the type strains Streptococcus anginosus ATCC 33397, Streptococcus constellatus ATCC 27823, and Streptococcus intermedius ATCC 27335. The hybridization results were compared with the reference phenotypic identification method data (R. A. Whiley, H. Fraser, J. M. Hardie, and D. Beighton, J. Clin. Microbiol. 28:1497-1501, 1990). Most strains (357 of 399 [89.5%]) reacted unambiguously with only one probe. However, 42 of the 399 strains (10.5%) reacted with both the S. constellatus- and S. intermedius-specific probes; 41 of them were phenotypically identified as S. constellatus. These dually reactive strains hybridized with a 5'-biotinylated probe based on the bp 213 to 231 region of the 16S rRNA gene sequence of one of two species. Analysis of the 5' ends of the 16S rRNA gene sequences (487 bp) demonstrated that the dually reactive strains represent a distinct rRNA population sharing 98.1% sequence similarity with S. constellatus. Phenotypic consistency between the dually reactive strains and the S. constellatus strains was not demonstrated. Line blot hybridization proved to be a simple and inexpensive method to screen large numbers of strains for genetic relatedness, and it allowed the detection of a distinct 16S rRNA type within the "S. milleri" group.
TI  - Interactions between Eikenella corrodens and 'Streptococcus milleri-group' organisms: possible mechanisms of pathogenicity in mixed infections.
AB  - Interactions between the 'Streptococcus milleri-group' organisms (SMG; S. intermedius, S. constellatus and S. anginosus) and Eikenella corrodens were investigated. Coaggregation reactions occurred frequently between S. anginosus (83% of strain combinations) or S. constellatus (87%) and E. corrodens isolates, but were infrequent between S. intermedius and E. corrodens (28%). No enhancement of enzyme activities against lipid, phosphate, peptide and saccharide substrates tested were detected with combinations of species in comparison to the species alone. Exponential growth of S. constellatus and S. intermedius, in mixed culture with E. corrodens, occurred within 6h post inoculation, in comparison to 25h without E. corrodens. No growth stimulation of S. anginosus was observed. It is concluded that both coaggregation and growth stimulation occur between E. corrodens and SMG isolates, and may be important mechanisms in the establishment of mixed infections involving these bacteria.
TI  - In-vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of the "Streptococcus milleri' group (Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus and Streptococcus intermedius).
AB  - A collection of 423 clinical "Streptococcus milleri' strains was speciated and tested for susceptibilities to twelve antibiotics. Only 1.4% of the strains were of intermediate susceptibility to penicillin. None of the strains exhibited high-level resistance to gentamicin. Strains resistant to erythromycin, roxithromycin and clindamycin were found with a frequency of 2.6%, 2.4% and 2.4% respectively. Doxycycline resistance was found in 5.7% of the strains and occurred most frequently in Streptococcus anginosus. All the strains were susceptible to cefotaxime, vancomycin and teicoplanin. The results of this study do not indicate changing antibiotic resistance in strains of the "S. milleri' group, but local differences in antibiotic susceptibilities may occur.
TI  - The Streptococcus milleri group as a cause of pulmonary infections.
AB  - Streptococci that colonize the mouth and upper respiratory tract tend to be considered harmless commensals. In 45 cases of acute pneumonia and/or pulmonary abscess and 25 cases of thoracic empyema, the predominant species recovered were anaerobic bacteria and the Streptococcus milleri group, which encompasses the oral species Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, and Streptococcus intermedius. The isolation of most S. milleri organisms along with oral anaerobes indicated synergy between these groups. Studies in a mouse model of pneumonia demonstrated this synergy; mortality was higher, histopathologic abnormalities were more marked (reflecting acute pneumonia followed by pulmonary abscess or empyema), and viable bacteria were more numerous in the lungs of mice with mixed infections caused by the S. milleri group and anaerobes than in the lungs of those with monomicrobial infection. In vitro studies elucidated a possible mechanism of this synergistic effect: anaerobes may enhance the growth of the S. milleri group and/or inhibit the bactericidal activity of the host. We conclude that the S. milleri group is more important in pulmonary infections than has previously been recognized.
TI  - Evaluation of the automicrobic system for the identification of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The performance of the Automicrobic System with the Vitek gram-positive identification card (bioMerieux, France) in identifying strains of Streptococcus mutans was studied. Of 160 strains assayed, 72.5% were confirmed to be Streptococcus mutans; the remainder were identified as other species of streptocci (Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus sanguis I and II, Streptococcus intermedius, and Streptococcus constellatus).
TI  - Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus and Streptococcus intermedius. Clinical relevance, hemolytic and serologic characteristics.
AB  - A collection of 518 "Streptococcus milleri" isolates recovered from clinical specimens was identified to the species level according to recently established criteria. Streptococcus anginosus was the most frequently isolated species (59.3%), followed by S constellatus (30.3%) and S intermedius (10.4%). One third (34%) of all isolates were beta-hemolytic. The majority of S anginosus isolates were nonhemolytic, carried Lancefield group F, or were nongroupable. Most of the S constellatus isolates were beta-hemolytic, as well as 16.6% of S intermedius strains. Streptococcus anginosus was recovered more often from the genital and urinary tracts and S constellatus was recovered from the thorax. Streptococcus intermedius was mostly found in the head and neck area, but was also isolated from the abdomen and the skin, bone, and soft tissue. Streptococcus intermedius and nonhemolytic isolates were recovered most often from abscess-related specimens.
TI  - Cross-reactivity between human sialyl Lewis(x) oligosaccharide and common causative oral bacteria of infective endocarditis.
AB  - The expression of sialy-Lewis(x) (sLe(x); Neu5Ac alpha 2-3 Gal beta 1-4) (Fuc alpha 1-3) GlcNAc-R) on oral bacteria producing infective endocarditis was determined by a whole-cell enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and an immunoelectron microscopy using the well-characterized anti-sLe(x) monoclonal antibody SNH-3 (mAb SNH-3; IgM class). mAb SNH-3 reacted strongly with whole cells of oral bacteria: Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens and Porphyromonas gingivalis. The negatively stained immuno-electron micrograph of Streptococcus pyogenes showed many reactive gold particles on the cell surface. Our findings demonstrated the existence of immunologic mimicry between the sLe(x) oligosaccharide and cell surface antigens of many species associated with infective endocarditis. We propose the hypothesis that if these bacteria escape their normal habitats, the surface components that mimic the sLe(x) oligosaccharide might bind to host antigens of the selectin family which could promote binding to endothelial cells and, consequently, initiation of the events leading to infective endocarditis.
TI  - Identification of "Streptococcus milleri" group isolates to the species level with a commercially available rapid test system.
AB  - Clinical isolates of the "Streptococcus milleri" species group were examined by conventional methods and a rapid, commercially available method for the identification of these strains to the species level. The levels of agreement between the identifications obtained with the commercially available system (Fluo-Card Milleri; KEY Scientific, Round Rock, Tex.) and conventional methods were 98% for 50 Streptococcus anginosus strains, 97% for 31 Streptococcus constellatus strains, and 88% for 17 isolates identified as Streptococcus intermedius. Patient records were also studied in order to gain information on the frequency and sites of isolation of each of the three "S. milleri" group species.
TI  - Hydrolytic enzymes of Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus and Streptococcus intermedius in relation to infection.
AB  - A collection of 518 'Streptococcus milleri' strains was tested for the presence of hydrolytic enzymes, and the results were related to the clinical significance of the strains. Ribonuclease activity was equally distributed among the three species while hyaluronidase activity was linked to Streptococcus intermedius and Streptococcus constellatus. Both enzymes were not significantly associated with infection-related strains. Deoxyribonuclease and chondroitin sulfatase activity tended to be present more frequently in Streptococcus intermedius and Streptococcus constellatus and was associated with infection-related strains (p < 0.001).
TI  - [Eight cases of infection caused by the Streptococcus milleri group--significance of serum antibody titer and a comparative investigation of the backgrounds and factors of infections caused by Streptococcus milleri and Streptococcus pneumoniae].
AB  - Eight cases of infection caused by Streptococcus milleri were studied clinically, and a comparative study was made of the backgrounds and factors influencing the development of infectious diseases caused by Streptococcus milleri and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The patients (six males and two females) with infectious diseases caused by Streptococcus milleri ranged in age from 21 to 81 years old with an average age of 62.0 years. The infectious diseases encountered among the patients were pyothorax in three patients, and in one patient each pyothorax and lung abscess, pleurisy, a secondary infection of pulmonary emphysema, skin infection related to a tracheostomy, a subdural abscess and a brain abscess, respectively. Six out of the eight cases had infections which formed pus. An underlying disease existed in seven cases, and, in five of these seven cases, it influenced the general condition of these patients. Six serum antibody titers for the S. milleri groups were examined in the First Department of Internal Medicine, University of the Ryukyus. Three cases for S. anginosus, two cases for S. intermedius, and one case for S. constellatus showed high titers of X1024 or X2048. Therefore, the examination of the serum antibody titer seems useful for the diagnosis of infections caused by the S. milleri group. We also carried out a comparative investigation of the backgrounds and factors of infectious diseases caused by S. milleri and S. pneumoniae. There are more underlying diseases in infections caused by S. milleri than in those caused by S. pneumoniae. There were more smokers among the patients with infections caused by S. milleri than among those with S. pneumonia infections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Viridans streptococci isolated from the bloodstream. Relevance of species identification.
AB  - Over a 4-year-period, 104 isolates belonging to the viridans streptococci were recovered from the blood and identified to the species according to Beighton and co-workers. Streptococcus oralis was the species most frequently recovered from patients in the hematology unit [29 of 39 (74%)]. Streptococcus mitis ranked second [seven of 39 (18%)]. Both species were associated with oromucositis. Isolates presently identified as S. oralis are mainly those previously identified as S. mitis or Streptococcus sanguis II. Streptococcus milleri was most frequently isolated in the patients from the general hospital population [28 of 65 (43%) isolates]: Streptococcus anginosus (n = 20), Streptococcus constellatus (n = 4), and Streptococcus intermedius (n = 4). In 14 episodes from the general hospital population, clinical significance was judged questionable. From this part of the laboratory, clinical significance could not be predicted from the number of blood cultures grown, nor from the delay of growth detection. The Rapid ID 32 Strep system agreed well with the identifications according to the scheme of Beighton et al., whereas the API 20 Strep system did not.
TI  - Species identification of members of the Streptococcus milleri group isolated from the vagina by ID 32 Strep system and differential phenotypic characteristics.
AB  - The importance of bacterial vaginosis as a risk factor in obstetric and gynecological infections has recently been recognized. The bacterial vaginosis group of organisms includes members of the Streptococcus milleri group, the identification of which has caused much confusion. We prospectively surveyed the rates of carriage of S. milleri group organisms in 397 high vaginal swabs received in our laboratory. For the identification of 99 clinical isolates and 23 control strains, we compared the results obtained by the rapid ID 32 Strep system (Analytab Products) and by a scheme utilizing six differential phenotypic characteristics (presence of beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, alpha-glucosidase, beta-D-fucosidase, beta-galactosidase, beta-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, and beta-glucosidase) as described by Whiley et al. (R. A. Whiley, H. Fraser, J. M. Hardie, and D. Beighton, J. Clin. Microbiol. 28:1497-1501, 1990). We identified Streptococcus anginosus in 18% and Streptococcus constellatus in 0.05% of the specimens examined. Of the isolates of S. anginosus that reacted with grouping antisera, 20 of 25 belonged to Lancefield group F. The incubation conditions for bacterial cultures and for reaction mixtures affected the results of phenotypic characterization in the production of alpha-glucosidase, beta-galactosidase, and beta-glucosidase. However, by using bacterial cultures grown under hypercapnic conditions and incubating the reaction mixtures aerobically, consistent phenotypic characteristics were obtained, allowing identification similar to that obtained by the ID 32 Strep system. We therefore recommend the phenotypic scheme as an inexpensive, reliable, and convenient method for the initial identification of species of the S. milleri group.
TI  - Heterogeneity among 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacers of species within the 'Streptococcus milleri group'.
AB  - The 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer has been suggested as a suitable region of the bacterial genome from which to derive useful taxonomic information, particularly with regard to identification at the species level. To investigate this approach as an aid to the identification of the three species comprising the 'Streptococcus milleri group' (SMG), the spacers of isolates of Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus anginosus and Streptococcus constellatus were amplified by PCR and length polymorphisms determined by agarose gel electrophoresis. Phenotypically atypical isolates which had been identified presumptively as belonging to these three species were also included. Spacers from two representatives of each spacer length found within the three SMG species were sequenced. 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer length polymorphisms allowed discrimination between S. anginosus (350 bp or 450 bp amplification product) and S. constellatus (380 bp amplification product), species that are difficult to differentiate phenotypically. S. intermedius (330 bp or 450 bp amplification product) and S. anginosus (350 bp or 450 bp amplification product) were not reliably distinguished by this method but are phenotypically distinct. Sequencing data demonstrated that the spacers had a central region of highly variable length flanked by conserved regions which included a single tRNA(Ala) gene. Polymorphism in the length of the 16S-23S spacer determined by PCR provides a rapid and useful adjunct to strain identification for S. anginosus and S. constellatus, which are not readily differentiated phenotypically.
TI  - Effects of different acidulants on growth of 'Streptococcus milleri group' strains isolated from various sites of the human body.
AB  - Growth of human clinical isolates of Streptococcus constellatus, Strep. intermedius and Strep. anginosus in HCl-, acetate and lactate acidified media was investigated. Under aerobic conditions, Strep. constellatus and Strep. anginosus were significantly more tolerant to all the acidulants than was Strep. intermedius. Under anaerobic conditions, Strep. anginosus and Strep. intermedius were significantly more tolerant to acetic acid (pH < 4.5) than Strep. constellatus.
TI  - Conservation of salivary glycoprotein-interacting and human immunoglobulin G-cross-reactive domains of antigen I/II in oral streptococci.
AB  - In this study we localized more precisely the salivary glycoprotein-interacting and the human immunoglobulin G (hIgG)-cross-reacting domains on the SR molecule, an antigen I/II-related protein from S. mutans serotype f. Mapping of the SR molecule with polypeptides expressed by subclones covering the entire molecule and with synthetic peptides demonstrates that the salivary glycoprotein-binding domain is located in the N-terminal alanine-rich repeats of the SR molecule. In order to investigate the degree of conservation of both regions in various oral streptococci, we tested the reactivity of 8 representative strains of the mutans group and 11 nonmutans oral Streptococcus strains (S. anginosus, S. milleri, S. constellatus, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. sanguis, S. gordonii, S. salivarius, and S. mitis strains) with antipeptide antibodies in a whole-cell enzyme linked immunosorbent assay together with colony hybridization analysis using DNA probes designed to map these two regions. All the mutans group strains except S. rattus and the 11 nonmutans streptococcal strains showed a high conservation of the C-terminal part of the SR molecule, especially the hIgG-cross-reacting domain, and less homology for the N-terminal salivary glycoprotein-binding region. Almost all of the sera from patients with rheumatic disease reacted strongly with SR from S. mutans serotype f, P1 from S. mutans serotype c, and four peptides located in the hIgG-cross-reacting region and not with peptides located at the C and N termini and in the proline-rich repeats. These results confirm that epitopes located within this region are immunogenic in humans and could lead to the synthesis of natural anti-IgG antibodies.
TI  - Mucin-sulphatase activity of some oral streptococci.
AB  - Mucin-sulphatase activity, measured using a 35S-[SO4(2-)]-labelled colonic mucin  substrate, was detected in whole cells of Streptococci isolated from the human oral cavity. The highest levels of sulphatase activity were found in all strains of Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis and in half of the strains of Streptococcus mutans tested. Little or no activity was detected in 9 of the 11 Streptococcus oralis strains examined, in the 4 Streptococcus constellatus strains, and in the 3 Streptococcus anginosus isolates tested. The highest enzyme levels were obtained from the two fresh Streptococcus gordonii isolates. This is the first report of such activity in oral microorganisms. Streptococcal mucin-sulphatase may contribute to the destruction of salivary mucins and mitigate their protective functions in the oral cavity, and be a determinant in the development of dental caries.
TI  - [Parenchymatous abscess in Streptococcus anginosus (Streptococcus milleri) septicemia. Value of their systematic search, apropos of 4 cases].
AB  - Streptococcus anginosus, the term suggested to cover a set of streptococci previously known under various names (milleri, MG, anginosus, intermedius, constellatus), is characterized by a propensity to create parenchymatous abscesses, essentially cerebral or hepatic, particularly within the terms of septicemia. These abscesses are sometimes difficult to detect due to a difficult or non-existent symptomatology. The authors report on four cases illustrating the necessity to search for them systematically by cerebral CT scan and abdominal echography or CT scan in all cases of septicemia caused by Streptococcus anginosus.
TI  - Interaction of the salivary glycoprotein EP-GP with the bacterium Streptococcus salivarius HB.
AB  - The interaction of the human salivary glycoprotein EP-GP with a number of oral bacterial species, following incubation with human whole saliva, has been investigated. EP-GP could be detected with a specific monoclonal antibody, by means of ELISA or by electrophoresis in combination with Western Transfer. The results indicated that EP-GP is bound only by Streptococcus salivarius, and not by the other tested strains of bacteria, Actinomyces viscosus, A. naeslundii, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides fragilis, S. gordonii, S. oralis, S. sanguis, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. rattus, S. constellatus, and S. anginosus. Binding of EP-GP to S. salivarius is mediated by a protein-protein interaction, which was found to be pH-dependent with a maximum binding between pH 5 and 6. For further characterization of the binding of EP-GP to S. salivarius, four mutants were tested, each of them lacking different cell wall antigens. EP-GP was bound to all mutants in amounts comparable with the wildtype, in spite of the different surface antigen compositions. We were able to identify a 27-kD EP-GP binding protein, by extraction of S. salivarius-cell wall antigens and electrophoretic techniques. In addition to EP-GP, S. salivarius also bound two other salivary proteins, namely, secretory IgA and low-molecular-weight mucin (MG-2).
TI  - [Evaluation of phenotype characteristics of streptococci in the identification of the Streptococcus anginosus (Streptococcus milleri) group].
AB  - Microorganisms referred to as Streptococcus anginosus (Streptococcus milleri) group which consist of S. anginosus, S. intermedius and S. constellatus is very difficult to identify to the species level, because of their diversity of biochemical, hemolytic and serological characteristics and because of confusion surrounding their taxonomy. Identification procedures on three isolates from primary sterile sites of three different patients, using API 20A system are described. Streptococcus intermedius was established in two and Streptococcus anginosus in one case. The importance of these organisms as human pathogens should enhance efforts of clinical microbiologist towards their accurate identification.
TI  - The isolation and characterization of milleri group streptococci from dental periapical abscesses.
AB  - Reports of the isolation of streptococci from dental abscesses have shown an association of the "S. milleri" group with such lesions. There has been considerable confusion regarding the taxonomy of these organisms, but the milleri group has recently been reclassified into three distinct species: Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, and Streptococcus intermedius. In this study, 45 samples from dental periapical abscesses were examined. Milleri group streptococci were isolated from 16 patients (37%), 15 being identified as S. anginosus and one as S. intermedius. In one patient, S. anginosus was isolated in pure culture, and it would appear that this is the predominant species of milleri group streptococci associated with periapical abscesses.
TI  - Recent taxonomic changes for anaerobic gram-positive and selected gram-negative organisms.
AB  - The strains formerly classified as Streptococcus anginosus or "Streptococcus milleri" have now been recognized as three distinct species, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, and Streptococcus intermedius. Streptococcus morbillorum has been transferred into the genus Gemella. Four new species within the genus Peptostreptococcus were recently named. A recent addition to the genus Clostridium is Clostridium argentinense, which includes Clostridium botulinum type G. Two new species of Actinomyces have been introduced: Actinomyces georgiae and Actinomyces gerencseriae. Arachnia propionica was shown to be related to propionibacteria and has been renamed Propionibacterium propionicum. Eubacterium yurii was named to contain "test-tube brush" bacteria found in subgingival plaque. Lactobacillus uli and Lactobacillus rimae are obligately anaerobic lactobacilli found in periodontal pockets. Bilophila is a new genus of gram-negative bacilli. Wolinella recta and Wolinella curva are now included in the genus Campylobacter. The taxonomic position of Mobiluncus, currently assigned to the family Bacteroidaceae, remains uncertain.
TI  - Deoxyribonucleic acid relatedness and phenotypic characteristics of oral Streptococcus milleri strains.
AB  - Strains of oral Streptococcus milleri group were compared with the type strains of Streptococcus anginosus, S. intermedius, and S. constellatus by DNA-DNA hybridization at 60 degrees C. Of the 29 strains tested, twelve, twelve, and two strains were closely related to S. anginosus ATCC 33397T, S. intermedius ATCC 27335T, and S. constellatus ATCC 27823T, respectively. Generally, the strains classified in the S. anginosus group in DNA homology were non-beta-haemolytic and belonged to API S. milleri II and biotype I (lactose fermenting), whereas the strains of S. constellatus group were beta-haemolytic and belonged to API S. milleri I and biotype II (lactose non-fermenting). The strains of the S. intermedius group were all non-beta-haemolytic and belonged to API S. milleri II and mostly biotype II (lactose fermenting). Furthermore, all except one strain of the S. anginosus group were Lancefield group A/serotype a (A/a), ungroupable/serotype b (-/b), C/c, -/d, -/e, F/f or G/k, whereas those of the S. constellatus group were F/-. The strains of the S. intermedius group were -/g, -/h, -/i, -/j, or -/-.
TI  - Enzymatic differentiation and biochemical and serological characteristics of the  clinical isolates of Streptococcus angiosus, S. intermedius and S. constellatus.
AB  - Of the 29 'Streptococcus milleri' strains tested, all thirteen Streptococcus intermedius (DNA homology group 2) strains but none of the thirteen Streptococcus anginosus (group 1) strains produced beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, beta-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, alpha-N-acetylneuraminidase, beta-galactosidase, alpha-glucosidase, and hyaluronidase. The three Streptococcus constellatus (group 3) strains produced only the latter two. Glycosidase production divided 274 clinical isolates into 103 S. anginosus, 101 S. intermedius, and 70 S. constellatus strains. Generally, strains of S. anginosus and S. intermedius were non-beta-haemolytic. API II and biotype Ia (lactose positive), but the former contained almost all API III strains and belonged to Lancefield group A/serotype a (A/a), -/b, C/c, -/d, -/e, F/f or G/k, and the latter included most of biotype IId (lactose negative) and serovar -/g, -/h, -/i or -/j. S constellatus strains were beta-, alpha- or gamma-haemolytic, of API I or II but mostly biotype Ib (lactose negative), and of F/- or -/b. S. intermedius was a major member of the oral isolates. Non-oral isolates were virtually all S. anginosus (mainly urogenital isolates) or S. constellatus (the other systemic isolates).
TI  - Streptococcus milleri group: renewed interest in an elusive pathogen.
AB  - The following review examines the bacteriological characteristics, epidemiology,  pathogenicity and antimicrobial susceptibility of the "Streptococcus milleri group". "Streptococcus milleri group" is a term for a large group of streptococci which includes Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus constellatus and Streptococcus anginosus. Usually considered commensals, these organisms are often associated with various pyogenic infections including cardiac, abdominal, skin and central nervous system infections. Organisms of the "Streptococcus milleri group" are often unrecognized pathogens due to the lack of uniformity in classifications and difficulties in microbiological identification. Penicillin G, cephalosporins, clindamycin and vancomycin all possess activity against these streptococci. Use of agents with poor activity may promote infections with "Streptococcus milleri group" and allow it to exhibit its pathogenicity. An understanding of these organisms may aid in their recognition and proper treatment.
TI  - Biological characterisation of group F streptococci causing human infections.
AB  - Fifty five strains of group F streptococci (GFS) isolated from clinical samples of 53 patients with diverse diseases, were characterised by a battery of physiological tests. Among them 37 (67%) were Streptococcus anginosus F, 14 (25%) were Strep. intermedius, two of which were mannitol positive and 4 (7%) were Strep. constellatus. Determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations of penicillin, erythromycin, ampicillin, gentamicin and cefazolin showed that despite their biochemical heterogeneity, all strains were uniformly susceptible to these antibiotics. Except for bacteraemia, other diseases due to GFS responded well to surgical drainage and/or antibiotics.
TI  - A numerical taxonomic study of the "Streptococcus milleri" group based upon conventional phenotypic tests and pyrolysis mass spectrometry.
AB  - Clinical strains presumptively identified as Streptococcus milleri (60), and blind coded collection strains (21) were characterised in conventional tests and pyrolysis mass spectrometry. Comparison of the clusters found by these two approaches revealed five clearly distinct centres of variation. Three corresponded to the DNA homology groups suggested by Whiley and Hardie (1989) as representing the species S. anginosus, S. intermedius and S. constellatus; a fourth comprised three Lancefield group C beta-haemolytic strains; the fifth may represent a biotype of S. anginosus. The characteristics of the latter group are described.
TI  - Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus constellatus, and Streptococcus anginosus (the Streptococcus milleri group): association with different body sites and clinical infections.
AB  - The associations of Streptococcus intermedius, S. constellatus, and S. anginosus  (the three species of the S. milleri group) with clinical infections and sites of isolation were investigated by using a simple biochemical scheme to identify a collection of 153 clinical isolates. S. intermedius was associated with abscesses of the brain and liver, while both S. anginosus and S. constellatus were isolated from a wider range of sites and infections. S. anginosus strains predominated in both genitourinary and gastrointestinal sources and exhibited a wider range of phenotypes, particularly in the ability to ferment mannitol and/or raffinose.
TI  - A scheme for the identification of viridans streptococci.
AB  - A collection of strains representing all the currently recognised species of oral or viridans streptococci (Streptococcus sanguis, S. parasanguis, S. gordonii, S. oralis, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. vestibularis, S. anginosus, S. constellatus, s. intermedius, S. mutans and S. sobrinus) were tested for the production of a range of glycosidase activities with 4-methylumbelliferyl-linked fluorogenic substrates, and for reactions in a range of conventional fermentation and hydrolytic tests. The resulting biochemical scheme, consisting of 14 tests, enabled the differentiation of all these species and distinguished three biotypes within S. sanguis. The scheme reported here represents an improvement over currently available schemes for the identification of viridans streptococci.
TI  - [Studies on clinical significance of "Streptococcus milleri group" in respiratory infections].
AB  - "Streptococcus milleri group" are the part of the indigenous oral flora, and they are proposed to contain three distinct species: Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, and Streptococcus intermedius. Though not included in the approved lists of bacterial names, "S. milleri group" are regarded as the causative organisms of suppurative infections, such as oral abscess, brain abscess, lung abscess and empyema. I have studied the clinical significance of the "S. milleri group" in respiratory infections. An investigation was performed to confirm the incidence of "S. milleri group" colonization in healthy 120 volunteers' (20 y/o-80 y/o) throats, and it was found that 11.7% (14/120) were positive. On the other hand, attention should be paid to the fact that the "S. milleri group" was highly isolated, 24 (24.7%) in 97 purulent respiratory specimens (94 sputa and 3 throat swabs) from which no other significant microorganism was recovered. I have measured the serum antibody titers of the "S. milleri group", employing the IFA technique, in 10 patients from whose specimens "S. milleri group" was predominantly isolated, and compared with those of 18 healthy volunteers. Whereas all of the titers of healthy volunteers reveal less than 1:256, those of the patients reveal more than 1:512. And antibody titers to "S. milleri group" showed the highest in two weeks after "S. milleri group" isolation, and came down to healthy adult levels in six weeks or more. Thus far, about half of the causative organisms of acute pneumonia have been reported unknown. In this study I have suggested that the "S. milleri group" plays an important role as the causative organism in respiratory infections including pneumonia.
TI  - Emended descriptions and recognition of Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus intermedius, and Streptococcus anginosus as distinct species.
AB  - Strains currently classified as Streptococcus anginosus include strains previously identified as Streptococcus constellatus (Prevot 1924) Holdeman and Moore 1974, Streptococcus intermedius (Prevot 1925), and "Streptococcus milleri" (Guthof 1956) because these specific epithets were argued to be later synonyms of Streptococcus anginosus (Andrewes and Horder 1906) Smith and Sherman 1938 by Coykendall et al. (Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 37:222-228, 1987). However, recent data from DNA-DNA hybridization experiments, whole-cell-derived polypeptide patterns determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and data from phenotypic testing have demonstrated that Streptococcus anginosus strains represent three readily identifiable taxa to which the previously assigned type strains of Streptococcus constellatus (strain NCDO 2226 [= ATCC 27823], Streptococcus intermedius (strain NCDO 2227 [= ATCC 27335], and Streptococcus anginosus (strain NCTC 10713 [= ATCC 33397] have been shown to belong. Therefore, we propose recognition of Streptococcus constellatus (emend.) (type strain NCDO 2226 [= ATCC 27823]), Streptococcus intermedius (emend.) (type strain NCDO 2227 [= ATCC 27335]), and Streptococcus anginosus (emend.) (type strain NCTC 10713 [= ATCC 33397]) as distinct species and propose an emended description of each of these taxa.
TI  - Phenotypic differentiation of Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus constellatus, and Streptococcus anginosus strains within the "Streptococcus milleri group".
AB  - A biochemical scheme was developed by which strains of Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus intermedius, and Streptococcus anginosus can reliably be distinguished from within the "Streptococcus milleri group." Strains identified as S. intermedius were differentiated by the ability to produce detectable levels of alpha-glucosidase, beta-galactosidase, beta-D-fucosidase, beta-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, and sialidase with 4-methylumbelliferyl-linked fluorogenic substrates in microdilution trays after 3 h of incubation at 37 degrees C, together with the production of hyaluronidase. Strains of S. constellatus and S. anginosus were differentiated by the production of alpha-glucosidase and hyaluronidase by the former and the production of beta-glucosidase by the latter. The majority of strains of the S. milleri group obtained from dental plaque were identified as S. intermedius, as were most strains isolated from abscesses of the brain and liver. Strains of S. constellatus and S. anginosus were from a wider variety of infections, both oral and nonoral, than were strains of S. intermedius, with the majority of strains from urogenital infections being identified as S. anginosus.
TI  - Sialidase activity of the "Streptococcus milleri group" and other viridans group  streptococci.
AB  - Viridans group streptococci were examined for the production of sialidase (neuraminidase) activity, using the fluorescent substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid in a simple and rapid (15-min) assay. Sialidase was produced by all strains of Streptococcus oralis and S. intermedius and by a majority of S. mitis strains. S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. gordonii, S. sanguis, S. vestibularis, S. salivarius, S. anginosus, S. constellatus, "S. parasanguis," and the "tufted fibril group" were uniformly negative. Sialidase production may be a useful characteristic to assist in the identification of viridans group streptococci.
TI  - Serogrouping of oral Streptococcus intermedius.
AB  - Employing twenty fresh oral isolates of Streptococcus intermedius, studies were carried out to characterize serological relations among the isolates and also between the isolates and the strains of bacterial species closely related to S. intermedius. The Rantz-Randall extracts from the cells were used as antigens. The anti-rabbit serum raised against S. intermedius ATCC 27335T reacted with the cell extracts from only three strains of the isolates, which were designated serogroup I strains. The other isolates were classified into four serogroups, I, III, IV, and V, which specifically reacted with the cell extracts from the homologous serogroup strains. However, the serogroup II antiserum formed in immunodiffusion a common precipitin line between the extracts from the cells of serogroups II and I. The serogroups I, III, IV, and V antisera reacted with none of the extracts from the bacterial cells closely related to S. intermedius, which included Streptococcus anginosus ATCC 33397T, Streptococcus constellatus ATCC 27823T, three NCTC strains of "Streptococcus milleri," and three ATCC strains of Streptococcus MG. The precipitin line formed by the homologous reaction of the serogroup II antiserum was found to be a reaction of identity with that formed by the extract from "S. milleri" NCTC 10708. Conversely, the antiserum against NCTC 10708 strain did not react with the cell extracts of serogroup II.
TI  - DNA-DNA hybridization studies and phenotypic characteristics of strains within the 'Streptococcus milleri group'.
AB  - Twenty-five strains resembling 'Streptococcus milleri' were compared by DNA-DNA hybridization, by whole-cell-derived polypeptide patterns on SDS-PAGE, and by biochemical tests. Four homology groups were revealed by DNA-DNA hybridization. DNA homology groups 1, 2 and 3 were closely related and contained the type strains NCDO 2226 (Streptococcus constellatus), NCDO 2227 (Streptococcus intermedius) and NCTC 10713 (Streptococcus anginosus), respectively. DNA homology group 4 consisted of four strains received as variants of Streptococcus intermedius which were found not to be closely related to strains in groups 1-3. The data from SDS-PAGE polypeptide patterns and biochemical tests supported the recognition of three centres of variation within the 'Streptococcus milleri group' corresponding to DNA homology groups 1-3 and indicated that strains of DNA homology group 4 are members of an as yet undescribed species within the viridans streptococci.
TI  - Classification and identification of the viridans streptococci.
AB  - This review traces the history of the human, nonhemolytic, or viridans, streptococci and describes improvements in their taxonomy wrought by study of their biochemical profiles and analysis of their nucleic acids. The goal was to define species on the basis of genetic relationships and to describe these species by their phenotypic characteristics so that they can be easily identified. This method has resulted in the division of some species. Streptococcus mutans has been divided into four species, two of which are common in humans. Three more mutans group species are indigenous to animals. Conversely, S. constellatus, S. intermedius, and "S. milleri" have been combined under S. anginosus. S. mitis (or "S. mitior") can be well-defined and includes S. sanguis II. There is genetic heterogeneity within S. sanguis, but the species is usually easy to identify. There is also some heterogeneity in S. bovis, but most human isolates are genetically related. Discussions of the taxonomy of these species are accompanied by descriptions of the characteristics by which these streptococci can be identified. Among these species are potential pathogens which should be suspected in cases of endocarditis and purulent infections of liver, brain, and other tissues.
TI  - A qualitative and quantitative study of the cellular fatty acids of 'Streptococcus milleri' with capillary gas chromatography.
AB  - Fatty acid analysis was done with GC and GC-MS on 21 strains of 'Streptococcus milleri', representative of the various proposed species. Although no qualitative differences were found in the fatty acid profiles, discriminant analysis of the quantitative data revealed three groups. Streptococcus anginosus and Streptococcus constellatus were indistinguishable but separated from the other two groups which comprised Streptococcus intermedius, with a wide fermentation pattern and Streptococcus intermedius with a narrow fermentation pattern. Three of the strains could be distinguished from the others by a 'fingerprint' of a particularly prominent fatty acid peak. The results support the suggestion that there is more than one species in this group of organisms and that the technique might be of value in epidemiological investigations of 'S. milleri'.
TI  - [Taxonomic studies of the Streptococcus intermedius strains isolated from human oral cavities].
AB  - Human oral isolates of Streptococcus intermedius, which were biochemically identified, have been classified into 5-Serogroups (I-V). Selecting some representive stock cultures together with the type strain ATCC 27335, comparisons were carried out between them in terms of cell extractable proteins, G + C mol% values, DNA-DNA homology and DNA restriction fragments. Since the taxon of S. intermedius has not been clarified, comparison was also made between the above strains and the type strains of the "Streptococcus anginosus-milleri Group", Streptococcus anginosus, "Streptococcus milleri" and Streptococcus constellatus, which were thought to be related to S. intermedius. 1. G + C mol% of S. intermedius ATCC 27335 was 38.0 +/- 0.28. The values of all the isolates tested ranged from 37.0 to 38.8. On the other hand, the values of the type strains of the "S. anginosus-milleri Group" were 38.0-38.8. 2. Under stringent conditions of DNA-DNA hybridization, all the isolates showed more than 66.7% homology with S. intermedius ATCC 27335, demonstrating that these strains belonged to the same species. On the other hand, S. anginosus ATCC 33397, "S. milleri" NCTC 11169 and S. constellatus ATCC 27823 hybridized at levels of 50%, 53% and 28%, respectively. Consequently, it was impossible to classify these strains as being the same species as S. intermedius. 3. When the DNA restriction fragments were compared by PAGE, the strains of Serogroups I and V showed the same pattern, respectively. The strains of Serogroups II and III, however, showed two different patterns, and these of Serogroup IV showed five different patterns. DNA fragments specific to S. intermedius could not be identified. 4. When cell extractable groups were compared by SDS-PAGE, the strains of Serogroups I and V showed identical patterns. The strains of Serogroup III showed 2 different patterns and those of Serogroup IV showed 5 patterns. These results reflected those of the DNA restriction analysis. However, the strains of Serogroup II showed the same protein pattern, although 2 different patterns were observed in DNA restriction fragments. Unique proteins, which were not detected in the proteins extracted from the type strains of the "S. anginosus-milleri Group", were observed in the cell proteins of S. intermedius strains. 5. The results of DNA-DNA hybridization and the existence of unique extractable proteins together with the chondroitinase productivity suggest that the strains of S. intermedius might represent a particular taxon among the strains of the "S. anginosus-milleri Group".(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Evaluation of the API 20 STREP system for species identification of "viridans" streptococci isolated from bacteremia.
AB  - Species identifications of 71 strains of viridans streptococci isolated from blood and 4 reference strains were made by the API 20 STREP system (API system S. A., Montalieu-Vercien, France) and the conventional method. There are high levels of agreement between results obtained with the both methods for determining acidification from carbohydrate except inulin. The API 20 STREP system correctly identified 74.7% of the viridans streptococci with 9.3% low descrimination, 12% incorrect and 4% unidentified. All strains of S. mitis, S. mutans, S. salivarius and S. anginosus-constellatus were correctly identified. The correct identification rates for S. sanguis I, S. sanguis II and S. MG-intermedius were 88.9%, 68% and 61% respectively. The difference of inulin reaction and the taxonomy discrepancy may be the cause of different identification. The study indicates that the API 20 STREP system has a good potentiality for species identification of viridans streptococci at present time, however, further refinement in needed.
TI  - Fatty acid composition of Streptococcus milleri.
AB  - The cellular fatty acids of 31 strains belonging to the Streptococcus milleri group were analysed by capillary gas-liquid chromatography. Results were compared with findings from biochemical differentiation of the strains into Streptococcus constellatus (two strains), Streptococcus anginosus (16 strains) and Streptococcus intermedius (13 strains). Eight strains of various other streptococci were included as internal references, including three strains of streptococcus morbillorum, three strains of beta-hemolytic streptococci, and two strains of enterococci. The Streptococcus milleri strains formed a very homogeneous group according to fatty acid composition and were easily differentiated from other groups. However, within the group, it was not possible to differentiate Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus anginosus and Streptococcus intermedius by fatty acid composition alone.
TI  - Streptococcus anginosus-constellatus infection of the sternoclavicular joint.
AB  - We describe the first reported instance of sternoclavicular pyarthrosis caused by Streptococcus anginosus-constellatus. Infections caused by this organism are unusual in a nonimmunocompromised host. Common conditions predisposing to sternoclavicular joint infection were not present. A possible mechanism for the infection is offered.
TI  - Evaluation of a rapid latex agglutination test for identification of group D streptococci.
AB  - The SeroSTAT latex agglutination test (Scott Laboratories, Inc., Fiskesville, R.I.) for identification of group D streptococci was compared with bile-esculin agar and Lancefield grouping by using 110 clinical isolates of group D streptococci (S. faecalis, 74; S. bovis, 24; S. durans, 3; S. faecium, 9) and 65 viridans streptococci (S. anginosus-constellatus, 2; Streptococcus MG, 15; S. sanguis II, 14; S. mitis, 7; S. mutans, 5; S. salivarius, 8; S. sanguis I, 8; S. acidominimus, 1; S. morbillorum, 2; S. pneumoniae, 3). All strains of group D streptococci were bile-esculin positive. SeroSTAT reactions were falsely positive with 2 strains of S. sanguisII and 1 strain of Streptococcus MG (4.6% of all viridans streptococci tested) and falsely negative with 10 S. bovis, 8 S. faecalis, 1 S. durans, and 6 S. faecium strains (22.7% of all group D streptococci tested). When considered with colonial morphology and hemolytic reaction, SeroSTAT is a rapid (60-s) and useful test for recognition of group D streptococci.
TI  - Purulent pericarditis caused by Streptococcus anginosus-constellatus.
TI  - Prevalence of viridans streptococci exhibiting lactose-inhibitable coaggregation  with oral actinomycetes.
AB  - Fresh oral isolates from human dental plaque were selected on the basis of their  spherical morphology. In a double-blind experiment, their species identity and ability to coaggregate with human oral Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces naeslundii were determined. Of the 110 isolates characterized, 30 were identified as either Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus anginosus-constellatus, or Veillonella parvula; none of these coaggregated with the actinomycetes. The remaining 80 isolates were identified as Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus MG-intermedius, or Streptococcus morbillorum. Of these 49 isolates (61%) coaggregated with actinomycetes, and nearly 90% (43 of 49 isolates) exhibited lactose-inhibitable coaggregations. Compared with previously characterized coaggregation properties determined with stock culture strains of streptococci, 82% of the fresh isolates exhibited identical coaggregations. The other 18% made up a new coaggregation group that possessed a related lactose-inhibitable coaggregation pattern. Thus, most fresh isolates that coaggregated exhibited lactose-inhibitable coaggregations with human oral actinomycetes. It is suggested that these coaggregations are mediated by a network of lectin-carbohydrate interactions similar to those already characterized in previous studies with stock cultures of actinomycetes and streptococci.
TI  - Streptococcus anginosus-constellatus infections of the nervous system.
AB  - Two patients are presented with central nervous system infections due to an uncommon type of viridans streptococci, S anginosus-constellatus. Of the various streptococci, S pneumoniae is the most common etiologic agent in meningitis, but many species, including those which are facultative anaerobes or microaerophiles, have been isolated from cerebrospinal fluid, subdural empyema, and abscesses involving the brain and epidural space.
TI  - Biochemical properties of CO2-dependent streptococci.
AB  - A total of 153 clinical isolates and 10 reference strains were employed in an investigation of CO2-dependent streptococci. Their selection was based on a lactic acid homofermentative end product. This group of organisms grew best in 5 to 10% CO2, and several species, including Streptococcus mutans, S. intermedius, Streptococcus MG, S. anginosus, and S. constellatus, required increased CO2 for primary recovery. A basal medium of thioglycolate with 0.1% Tween 80 and phenol red was prepared and used with selected carbohydrates. This media provided luxuriant growth. Serological testing failed to give any definitive correlation with species identification. A shortened differentiation scheme, combined from previous studies, was proposed.
