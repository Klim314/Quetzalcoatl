TI  == microbiological diversity of peri-implantitis biofilm by sanger sequencing.
AB  == background and objective: to examine the microbial diversity associated with implants with or without peri-implantitis and to identify differences between the bacterial communities in these clinical conditions. material and methods: twenty  subjects were assigned to a control group consisting of subjects with healthy implants and a test group consisting of subjects with peri-implantitis sites, as  well as a healthy implant site (n = 10/group). in the test group, subgingival biofilm samples were taken from the deepest sites of the diseased implant. in both groups, samples were collected from one site around a healthy implant. dna was extracted and the 16s rrna gene was amplified and sequenced, and the phylotypes were identified by comparison with known 16s rrna sequences. results:  the phylogenetic identity of 1387 16s rrna gene clones was determined. healthy implants demonstrated higher proportions of actinomyces, atopobium, gemella, kingella and rothia and lower levels of campylobacter, desulfobulbus, dialister,  eubacterium, filifactor, mitsukella, porphyromonas and pseudoramibacter (mann-whitney u-test; p < 0.05). fusobacterium nucleatum, dialister invisus, streptococcus sp. human oral taxon (hot) 064, filifactor alocis and mitsuokella sp. hot 131 presented a higher mean proportion, while veillonella dispar, actinomyces meyeri, granulicatella adiacens showed lower mean proportions in the  peri-implantitis sites when compared with healthy implants in both the control and test groups (mann-whitney u-test; p < 0.05). conclusion: marked differences were observed in the composition of the subgingival biofilm between healthy and diseased implants. the biofilm associated with peri-implantitis harbored more pathogenic bacterial species from the orange complex and other "unusual" putative pathogens, such as f. alocis, d. invisus and mitsuokella sp. hot 131.

TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.

TI  == detection of novel oral species and phylotypes in symptomatic endodontic infections including abscesses.
AB  == this study was undertaken to investigate the occurrence of several uncultivated phylotypes and newly named bacterial species in symptomatic endodontic infections. samples taken from cases clinically diagnosed as acute periradicular  abscesses or acute periradicular periodontitis were surveyed for the presence of  12 taxa by means of a 16s rrna-gene-based nested or hemi-nested pcr assay. the most prevalent of the target taxa were dialister invisus, olsenella uli, granulicatella adiacens, and synergistes clones ba121 and e3_33. findings revealed that novel phylotypes and newly named species can take part in the microbiota associated with symptomatic endodontic infections and a pathogenetic role is suspected.
