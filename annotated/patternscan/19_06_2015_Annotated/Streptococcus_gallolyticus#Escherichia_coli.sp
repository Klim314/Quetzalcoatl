TI  == quantitative profiling of colorectal cancer-associated bacteria reveals associations between fusobacterium spp., enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis (etbf) and clinicopathological features of colorectal cancer.
AB  == various studies have presented clinical or in vitro evidence linking bacteria to  colorectal cancer, but these bacteria have not previously been concurrently quantified by qpcr in a single cohort. we quantify these bacteria (fusobacterium  spp., streptococcus gallolyticus, enterococcus faecalis, enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis (etbf), enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), and afac-  or pks-positive e. coli) in paired tumour and normal tissue samples from 55 colorectal cancer patients. we further investigate the relationship between a) the presence and b) the level of colonisation of each bacterial species with site and stage of disease, age, gender, ethnicity and msi-status. with the exception of s. gallolyticus, we detected all bacteria profiled here in both tumour and normal samples at varying frequencies. etbf (fdr = 0.001 and 0.002 for normal and tumour samples) and afac-positive e. coli (fdr = 0.03, normal samples) were significantly enriched in the colon compared to the rectum. etbf (fdr = 0.04 and  0.002 for normal and tumour samples, respectively) and fusobacterium spp. (fdr =  0.03 tumour samples) levels were significantly higher in late stage (iii/iv) colorectal cancers. fusobacterium was by far the most common bacteria detected, occurring in 82% and 81% of paired tumour and normal samples. fusobacterium was also the only bacterium that was significantly higher in tumour compared to normal samples (p = 6e-5). we also identified significant associations between high-level colonisation by fusobacterium and msi-h (fdr = 0.05), age (fdr = 0.03) or pks-positive e. coli (fdr = 0.01). furthermore, we exclusively identified atypical epec in our cohort, which has not been previously reported in association with colorectal cancer. by quantifying colorectal cancer-associated bacteria across a single cohort, we uncovered inter- and intra-individual patterns of colonization not previously recognized, as well as important associations with clinicopathological features, especially in the case of fusobacterium and etbf.

TI  == characterization of a bacterial tannase from streptococcus gallolyticus ucn34 suitable for tannin biodegradation.
AB  == the gene in the locus gallo_1609 from streptococcus gallolyticus ucn34 was cloned and expressed as an active protein in escherichia coli bl21 (de3). the protein was named tansg1 since it shows similarity to bacterial tannases previously described. the recombinant strain produced his-tagged tansg1 which was purified by affinity chromatography. purified tansg1 protein showed tannase activity, having a specific activity of 577 u/mg which is 41 % higher than the activity of  lactobacillus plantarum tannase. remarkably, tansg1 displayed optimum catalytic activity at ph 6-8 and 50-70 degrees c and showed high stability over a broad range of temperatures. it retained 25 % of its relative activity after prolonged  incubation at 45 degrees c. the specific activity of tansg1 is enhanced by the divalent cation ca(2+) and is dramatically reduced by zn(2+) and hg(2+). the enzyme was highly specific for gallate and protocatechuate esters and showed no catalytic activity against other phenolic esters. the protein tansg1 hydrolyzes efficiently tannic acid, a complex and polymeric gallotanin, allowing its complete conversion to gallic acid, a potent antioxidant. from its biochemical properties, tansg1 is a tannase with potential industrial interest regarding the  biodegradation of tannin waste or its bioconversion into biologically active products.

TI  == enterococcus and streptococcus spp. associated with chronic and self-medicated urinary tract infections in vietnam.
AB  == background: urinary tract infections (uti) are one of the most common infections  among women worldwide. e. coli often causes more than 75% of acute uncomplicated  uti, however, little is known about how recurrent utis and indiscriminate use of  antimicrobials affect the aetiology of utis. this study aimed to establish the aetiology of uti in a population of recurrent and self-medicated patients referred from pharmacies to a hospital in hanoi, vietnam and to describe genotypes and antimicrobial susceptibility of the associated bacterial pathogens. the aetiology of bacterial pathogens associated with uti (defined as >/= 104 cfu/ml urine) was established by phenotypic and molecular methods. enterococcus faecalis isolates were typed by multi locus sequence typing (mlst), pulsed-field  gel electrophoresis (pfge) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. methods: urine samples from 276 patients suffering symptoms of urinary tract infection were collected and cultured on flexicult agar(r) allowing for detection of the most common urine pathogens. patients were interviewed about underlying diseases, duration of symptoms, earlier episodes of uti, number of episodes diagnosed by doctors and treatment in relation to uti. all tentative e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates were identified to species level by pcr, 16s rrna and partial sequencing of the groel gene. e. faecalis isolates were further characterized by  multi locus sequence typing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. results: mean age of 49 patients was 48 yrs (range was 11-86 yrs) and included 94% women.  on average, patients reported to have suffered from uti for 348 days (range 3 days-10 years, and experienced 2.7 utis during the previous year). cephalosporins were reported the second drug of choice in treatment of uti at the hospital. e. faecalis (55.1%), e. coli (12.2%) and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (8.2%) were main bacterial pathogens. mic testing of e. faecalis showed susceptibility to ampicillin, penicillin and vancomycin, but high-level resistance against gentamicin (48.1%). mlst revealed 12 sequence types (st) of which st 16 made up 44.5% and showed closely related pfge types. conclusion: the  different aetiology of uti compared with reports elsewhere, where e. coli dominates, may be a result of chronic and recurrent utis together with indiscriminate use of antimicrobials. the similar genotypes shown by epidemiologically unrelated st 16 isolates in vietnam and elsewhere, suggest that e. faecalis st 16 might represent a globally distributed clone. treatment of uti  with cephalosporins may select for e. faecalis as it is intrinsic resistant and further studies are needed to establish the source(s) and role of e. faecalis st  16 in acute uti.

TI  == [fever as the presenting manifestation of colon cancer: a case series of 11 patients].
AB  == introduction: fever happens frequently in colon cancer but it is rarely the presenting manifestation. patients and methods: we report a case series of patients with colon cancer revealed by fever in the three military hospitals in paris. results: of the 11 patients studied, seven were men and four were women, and their mean age was 70 years. cancer was localized in the sigmoid colon (n=6), left colon (n=3) and right colon (n=2). cancer staging (uicc tnm classification 2002) was respectively ptis (n=1), i (n=4), ii (n=3) and iii (n=3). fever was the only reason for admission and two patients had a recurrent fever of unknown origin. all patients but one had bacterial infection. blood cultures grew up in six cases, escherichia coli (n=3), streptococcus gallolyticus (ex bovis) (n=2) and anaerobic bacteria (n=1). there was one case of infective endocarditis caused by s. gallolyticus. imaging showed a liver abscess (n=3) and a colon cancer complicated by an abscess (n=3). in seven patients, a familial history of colon cancer and symptoms of underlying colic disease were present (neglected rectal bleeding, iron deficiency anaemia, clinical evidence of an abdominal mass). conclusions: fever may reveal colon cancer at an early stage. its main cause is a bacterial infection, such as bacteremia or abscess. fever of unknown origin is a  rare presentation. detailed history, careful clinical examination and analysis of imaging contribute to recommend the prescription of colonoscopy.

TI  == molecular-phylogenetic characterization of the microbiota in ulcerated and non-ulcerated regions in the patients with crohn's disease.
AB  == background: the dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota has been established in crohn's disease (cd), but the molecular characterization of this dysbiosis in chinese subjects with cd remains unclear. this study aims to investigate the predominant bacterial composition of the faecal and mucosal-associated microbiota in chinese cd patients using culture-independent techniques. methods/principal findings: eighteen patients with cd and 9 healthy controls were included in this  study. the faeces and the intestinal mucosal tissues from the ulcerated and nonulcerated sites were subjected to bacterial community fingerprinting using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). the predominant bacterial composition in the faeces and mucosa was determined with dna sequencing and blast. we showed that the bacterial diversity in the faeces of cd patients was reduced compared with that in healthy controls (p<0.01). the faecal bacterial dysbiosis of the patients was characterized by an elevated abundance of gamma-proteobacteria (especially escherichia coli and shigella flexneri) and a reduced proportion of bacteroidetes and firmicutes. five bacterial species defined the microbiota imbalance of the ulcerated mucosa in cd, including an increase in escherichia coli, a decrease in faecalibacterium prausnitzii, lactobacillus coleohominis, bacteroides sp and streptococcus gallolyticus in the  bacterial community as compared with the nonulcerated (p<0.01). conclusions/significance: this is the first description of intestinal microbiota  dysbiosis in chinese cd patients. these results allow a better understanding of the faecal and mucosal microbiota in cd, showing a predominance of some opportunistic pathogenic bacteria and a decrease in beneficial bacterial species. the findings may provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of cd in chinese population.

TI  == [analysis of diversity of vaginal microbiota in healthy chinese women by using dna-fingerprinting].
AB  == objective: to analyze the diversity of healthy women's vaginal dominant flora in  different physiological states with pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), to establish the basis for the future study of lower genital tract infections, and to provide a theoretical basis for the development of vaginal probiotics adapted to chinese females. methods: women who underwent routine gynecologic examinations in peking university first hospital from october 2009 to january 2010 were enrolled, including 30 at reproductive age and 30 at post menopause age. vaginal samples were collected and then total bacterial dna was extracted. universal bacterial primers were used to amplify the v3 region of 16s  rdna gene. pcr products were analyzed by denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). featured bands on dgge were recovered, cloned and sequenced. alignment with known sequence was made by using blast on genbank to identify bacterial strains so as to analyze the diversity of healthy women's vaginal dominant flora  in different physiological states. results: (1) vaginal flora in healthy chinese  women at their reproductive age were relatively simple, lactobacillus were the dominant bacteria. common bacteria included: lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners,and lactobacillus gasseri. while l. iners were the dominant vaginal bacteria that could not be recognized by traditional method. (2) vaginal  bacteria in the women at post menopause age were more complex than in those at reproductive age. common bacteria included: lactobacillus iners, lactobacillus crispatus, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus gallolyticus, veillonella sp., streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus anginosus, prevotella sp., anaerococcus lactolyticus and bacteroides fragilis. conclusion: based on the dgge analysis, the most common vaginal bacteria in chinese healthy women at reproductive age are lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners,and lactobacillus gasseri. the most common vaginal bacteria in healthy post-menopausal women are lactobacillus iners, lactobacillus crispatus, escherichia coli, streptococcus sp., prevotella sp.,bacteroides fragilis and lactic acid producing veillonella sp. and anaerococcus lactolyticus. meanwhile lactobacillus iners was firstly found by dgge to be the dominant vaginal bacteria in different physiological states.

TI  == comparative molecular and microbiologic diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis.
AB  == sequencing of 16s rdna, and of sodaint and rpobint in some cases, was applied to  dna from heart valves of 46 patients (36 with definite and 10 with possible endocarditis). sequence-based identifications were compared with those obtained with conventional methods. among the 36 definite cases, 30 had positive blood cultures and 6 had negative cultures. among the 30 positive cases, sequencing of  16s rdna permitted identification of species (18), genus (8), or neither (4); sodaint and rpobint sequencing was necessary for species identification in 8 cases. species identifications were identical in only 61.5%, when conventional techniques and dna sequencing were used. in five of the six blood culture-negative endocarditis cases, sequencing identified bartonella quintana (3), b. henselae (1), and streptococcus gallolyticus (1). our results demonstrate a clear benefit of molecular identification, particularly in cases of blood culture-negative endocarditis and of possible endocarditis, to confirm or invalidate the diagnosis. moreover, in 19.4% of the definite cases, the improvement in species identification by sequencing led to improved patient management.

TI  == prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among pigeon isolates of streptococcus gallolyticus, escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium.
AB  == thirty-three streptococcus gallolyticus, 60 escherichia coli and 18 salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium var. copenhagen strains isolated from homing pigeons (columba livia) were tested for susceptibility to the antimicrobials most commonly used to treat pigeons. minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined using the agar dilution technique. aminoglycosides (gentamicin and kanamycin), trimethoprim and flumequine were relatively inactive against the streptococci tested. acquired tetracycline resistance amounted to 85%, and lincomycin and macrolide (erythromycin) resistance to 48 and 45%, respectively. fluoroquinolone  (enrofloxacin) resistance was found in four s. gallolyticus strains. all strains  were susceptible to ampicillin. with the e. coli strains, resistance was found to all antibiotics tested. over one-half of them were resistant to tetracycline and  to broad-spectrum penicillins (ampicillin); however, none showed extended spectrum beta-lactamase activity, implying that the cephalosporins (ceftiofur) remained active. resistance to trimethoprim, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolone  ranked next. in contrast to the s. gallolyticus and e. coli strains, the s. enterica strains were susceptible to all the antimicrobials tested.

TI  == phenotypic and phylogenetic characterization of ruminal tannin-tolerant bacteria.
AB  == the 16s rrna sequences and selected phenotypic characteristics were determined for six recently isolated bacteria that can tolerate high levels of hydrolyzable  and condensed tannins. bacteria were isolated from the ruminal contents of animals in different geographic locations, including sardinian sheep (ovis aries), honduran and colombian goats (capra hircus), white-tail deer (odocoileus  virginianus) from upstate new york, and rocky mountain elk (cervus elaphus nelsoni) from oregon. nearly complete sequences of the small-subunit rrna genes,  which were obtained by pcr amplification, cloning, and sequencing, were used for  phylogenetic characterization. comparisons of the 16s rrna of the six isolates showed that four of the isolates were members of the genus streptococcus and were most closely related to ruminal strains of streptococcus bovis and the recently described organism streptococcus gallolyticus. one of the other isolates, a gram-positive rod, clustered with the clostridia in the low-g+c-content group of  gram-positive bacteria. the sixth isolate, a gram-negative rod, was a member of the family enterobacteriaceae in the gamma subdivision of the class proteobacteria. none of the 16s rrna sequences of the tannin-tolerant bacteria examined was identical to the sequence of any previously described microorganism  or to the sequence of any of the other organisms examined in this study. three phylogenetically distinct groups of ruminal bacteria were isolated from four species of ruminants in europe, north america, and south america. the presence of tannin-tolerant bacteria is not restricted by climate, geography, or host animal, although attempts to isolate tannin-tolerant bacteria from cows on low-tannin diets failed.
