TI  == prevotella bergensis sp. nov., isolated from human infections.
AB  == eight strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacilli isolated from infections of the  skin and soft tissues were subjected to a comprehensive range of phenotypic and genotypic tests. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis revealed the strains to constitute a homogeneous group, distinct from species with validly published names but related to a cluster including prevotella buccae, prevotella dentalis and prevotella baroniae. a novel species, prevotella bergensis sp. nov., is proposed to accommodate these strains. prevotella bergensis is saccharolytic and  produces acetic and succinic acids as end products of fermentation. the g + c content of the dna of the type strain is 48 mol%. the type strain of prevotella bergensis is 94067913t (= dsm 17361t = ccug 51224t).

TI  == identification of proteases from periodontopathogenic bacteria as activators of latent human neutrophil and fibroblast-type interstitial collagenases.
AB  == activation of latent human fibroblast-type and neutrophil interstitial procollagenases as well as degradation of native type i collagen by supra- and subgingival dental plaque extracts, an 80-kda trypsinlike protease from porphyromas gingivalis (atcc 33277), a 95-kda chymotrypsinlike protease from treponema denticola (atcc 29522), and selected bacterial species commonly isolated in periodontitis was studied. the bacteria included were prevotella intermedia (atcc 25261), prevotella buccae (es 57), prevotella oris (atcc 33573), porphyromonas endodontalis (es 54b), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (atcc 295222), fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc 10953), mitsuokella dentalis (dsm 3688), and streptococcus mitis (atcc 15909). none of the bacteria activated latent procollagenases; however, both sub- and supragingival dental plaque extracts (neutral salt extraction) and proteases isolated from cell extracts from potentially periodontopathogenic bacteria p. gingivalis and t. denticola were found to activate latent human fibroblast-type and neutrophil interstitial procollagenases. the fibroblast-type interstitial collagenase was more efficiently activated by bacterial proteases than the neutrophil counterpart, which instead preferred nonproteolytic activation by the oxidative agent hypochlorous acid. the proteases were not able to convert collagenase tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (timp-1) complexes into active form or to change the ability of timp-1 to inhibit interstitial collagenase. none of the studied bacteria, proteases from p. gingivalis and t. denticola, or extracts of supra- and subgingival dental plaque showed any significant collagenolytic activity. however, the proteases degraded native and denatured collagen fragments after cleavage by interstitial collagenase and gelatinase. our results indicate that proteases from periodontopathogenic bacteria can act as direct proteolytic activators of human procollagenases and degrade collagen fragments. thus, in concert with host enzymes the bacterial proteases may participate in periodontal  tissue destruction.
