TI  == periodontal bacteria and prediabetes prevalence in origins: the oral infections,  glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance study.
AB  == periodontitis and type 2 diabetes mellitus are known to be associated. the relationship between periodontal microbiota and early diabetes risk has not been  studied. we investigated the association between periodontal bacteria and prediabetes prevalence among diabetes-free adults. origins (the oral infections,  glucose intolerance and insulin resistance study) cross sectionally enrolled 300  diabetes-free adults aged 20 to 55 y (mean +/- sd, 34 +/- 10 y; 77% female). prediabetes was defined as follows: 1) hemoglobin a1c values ranging from 5.7% to 6.4% or 2) fasting plasma glucose ranging from 100 to 125 mg/dl. in 1,188 subgingival plaque samples, 11 bacterial species were assessed at baseline, including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and actinomyces naeslundii. full-mouth clinical periodontal examinations were performed, and participants were defined as having no/mild periodontitis vs. moderate/severe periodontitis per the definition of the centers for disease control and prevention / american academy of periodontology. modified poisson regression evaluated prediabetes prevalence across bacterial tertiles. prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals for third vs. first tertiles are presented. all analyses were adjusted for cardiometabolic risk factors. all results presented currently arise from the baseline cross section. prediabetes prevalence was 18%, and 58% of participants had moderate/severe periodontitis. prevalence ratios (95% confidence intervals) summarizing associations between bacterial levels and prediabetes were as follows: a. actinomycetemcomitans, 2.48 (1.34, 4.58), p = 0.004; p. gingivalis, 3.41 (1.78, 6.58), p = 0.0003; t. denticola, 1.99 (0.992, 4.00), p = 0.052; t. forsythia, 1.95 (1.0, 3.84), p = 0.05; a. naeslundii, 0.46 (0.25, 0.85), p = 0.01. the prevalence ratio for prediabetes among participants with moderate/severe vs. no/mild periodontitis was 1.47 (0.78, 2.74), p = 0.23. higher colonization levels of specific periodontal microbiota are associated with higher prediabetes prevalence among diabetes-free adults.

TI  == fusobacterium nucleatum alters atherosclerosis risk factors and enhances inflammatory markers with an atheroprotective immune response in apoenull mice.
AB  == the american heart association supports an association between periodontal disease (pd) and atherosclerotic vascular disease (asvd) but does not as of yet support a causal relationship. recently, we have shown that major periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola are causally associated with acceleration of aortic atherosclerosis in apoenull hyperlipidemic mice. the aim of this study was to determine if oral infection with another significant periodontal pathogen fusobacterium nucleatum can accelerate aortic inflammation and atherosclerosis in the aortic artery of apoenull mice. apoenull  mice (n = 23) were orally infected with f. nucleatum atcc 49256 and euthanized at 12 and 24 weeks. periodontal disease assessments including f. nucleatum oral colonization, gingival inflammation, immune response, intrabony defects, and alveolar bone resorption were evaluated. systemic organs were evaluated for infection, aortic sections were examined for atherosclerosis, and inflammatory markers were measured. chronic oral infection established f. nucleatum colonization in the oral cavity, induced significant humoral igg (p=0.0001) and igm (p=0.001) antibody response (12 and 24 weeks), and resulted in significant (p=0.0001) alveolar bone resorption and intrabony defects. f. nucleatum genomic dna was detected in systemic organs (heart, aorta, liver, kidney, lung) indicating bacteremia. aortic atherosclerotic plaque area was measured and showed a local inflammatory infiltrate revealed the presence of f4/80+ macrophages and cd3+ t cells. vascular inflammation was detected by enhanced systemic cytokines (cd30l, il-4, il-12), oxidized ldl and serum amyloid a, as well as altered serum  lipid profile (cholesterol, triglycerides, chylomicrons, vldl, ldl, hdl), in infected mice and altered aortic gene expression in infected mice. despite evidence for systemic infection in several organs and modulation of known atherosclerosis risk factors, aortic atherosclerotic lesions were significantly reduced after f. nucleatum infection suggesting a potential protective function for this member of the oral microbiota.

TI  == periodontal infection and its putative links with alzheimer's disease.
AB  == periodontal disease (pd) and alzheimer's disease (ad) are inflammatory conditions affecting the global adult population. in the pathogenesis of pd, subgingival complex bacterial biofilm induces inflammation that leads to connective tissue degradation and alveolar bone resorption around the teeth. in health, junctional  epithelium seals the gingiva to the tooth enamel, thus preventing bacteria from entering the gingivae. chronic pd involves major pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia) which have an immune armoury that can circumvent host's immune surveillance to create and maintain an  inflammatory mediator rich and toxic environment to grow and survive. the neurodegenerative condition, ad, is characterised by poor memory and specific hallmark proteins; periodontal pathogens are increasingly being linked with this  dementing condition. it is therefore becoming important to understand associations of periodontitis with relevance to late-onset ad. the aim of this review is to discuss the relevance of finding the keystone periodontal pathogen p. gingivalis in ad brains and its plausible contribution to the aetiological hypothesis of this dementing condition.

TI  == evaluation of a hydrophobic gel adhering to the gingiva in comparison with a standard water-soluble 1% chlorhexidine gel after scaling and root planing in patients with moderate chronic periodontitis. a randomized clinical trial.
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the clinical, microbiological and enzymatic activity of a hydrophobic chlorhexidine-based gingiva-adhering gel containing herbal ingredients, compared with a commercially available 1% chlorhexidine water-soluble gel, during non-surgical therapy of moderate chronic periodontitis. methods: a total of 34 subjects participated in this 6-month blinded randomized parallel controlled trial (isrctn35210084). after scaling and root planing (srp), test group received the gel, by rubbing on the gingiva, once every second day, for 14 days. the control group received the control gel twice daily. clinical parameters considered were the approximal plaque index, simplified oral hygiene index, modified gingival index, bleeding on probing, probing depth and clinical attachment level (primary outcome), assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months, together with the frequency of detection of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.), prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola (t.d.), tannerella forsythia (t.f.), and activity of neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase (secondary outcomes). results: at 3 and 6 months, all clinical parameters improved significantly, without significant intergroup differences, except ohi-s, which improved at 3 months (p < 0.05). microbiological data resulted in no significant intergroup differences at baseline and 6 months. at 3 months, significant differences for p.g., t.f. and t.d. were noted. a significant reduction of neutrophil elastase after 3 and 6 months was observed (p < 0.005), without significant intergroup differences. for  myeloperoxidase, significant reductions were noted in both groups (p < 0.005 and  p < 0.05), but no significant intergroup differences. the tested product seemed to have an increased efficacy, due to longer persistence on the gingiva, with reduced application frequency. conclusions: both products had a relatively similar influence on the clinical, microbiological and enzymatic outcomes at 3 and 6 months after srp.

TI  == microbial dynamics during conversion from supragingival to subgingival biofilms in an in vitro model.
AB  == the development of dental caries and periodontal diseases result from distinct shifts in the microbiota of the tooth-associated biofilm. this in vitro study aimed to investigate changes in biofilm composition and structure, during the shift from a "supragingival" aerobic to a "subgingival" anaerobic profile. biofilms consisting of actinomyces oris, candida albicans, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar were aerobically grown in saliva-containing medium on hydroxyapatite discs. after 64 h, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia and streptococcus anginosus were further added along with human serum, while culture conditions were shifted to microaerophilic. after 96 h, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were finally added and the biofilm was grown anaerobically for another 64 h. at the end of each phase, biofilms were harvested for species-specific quantification and localization. apart from c. albicans, all other species gradually increased during aerobic and microaerophilic conditions,  but remained steady during anaerobic conditions. biofilm thickness was doubled during the microaerophilic phase, but remained steady throughout the anaerobic phase. extracellular polysaccharide presence was gradually reduced throughout the growth period. biofilm viability was reduced during the microaerophilic conversion, but was recovered during the anaerobic phase. this in vitro study has characterized the dynamic structural shifts occurring in an oral biofilm model during the switch from aerobic to anaerobic conditions, potentially modeling the  conversion of supragingival to subgingival biofilms. within the limitations of this experimental model, the findings may provide novel insights into the ecology of oral biofilms. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI  == microbiome profiles in periodontitis in relation to host and disease characteristics.
AB  == periodontitis is an inflammatory condition that affects the supporting tissues surrounding teeth. the occurrence of periodontitis is associated with shifts in the structure of the communities that inhabit the gingival sulcus. although great inter-subject variability in the subgingival microbiome has been observed in subjects with periodontitis, it is unclear whether distinct community types exist and if differences in microbial signatures correlate with host characteristics or with the variable clinical presentations of periodontitis. therefore, in this study we explored the existence of different community types in periodontitis and their relationship with host demographic, medical and disease-related clinical characteristics. clustering analyses of microbial abundance profiles suggested two types of communities (a and b) existed in the 34 subjects with periodontitis  evaluated. type b communities harbored greater proportions of certain periodontitis-associated taxa, including species historically associated with the disease, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola, and taxa recently linked to periodontitis. in contrast, subjects with  type a communities had increased proportions of different periodontitis-associated species, and were also enriched for health-associated species and core taxa (those equally prevalent in health and periodontitis). periodontitis subgingival clusters were not associated with demographic, medical  or disease-specific clinical parameters other than periodontitis extent (proportion of sites affected), which positively correlated with the total proportion of cluster b signature taxa. in conclusion, two types of microbial communities were detected in subjects with periodontitis. host demographics and underlying medical conditions did not correlate with these profiles, which instead appeared to be related to periodontitis extent, with type b communities present in more widespread disease cases. the two identified periodontitis profiles may represent distinct dysbiotic processes potentially requiring community-tailored therapeutic interventions.

TI  == periodontitis associated with plasminogen deficiency: a case report.
AB  == background: plasminogen deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disease, which is associated with aggressive periodontitis and gingival enlargement. previously  described treatments of plasminogen deficiency associated periodontitis have shown limited success. this is the first case report indicating a successful therapy approach consisting of a non-surgical supra- and subgingival debridement  in combination with an adjunctive systemic antibiotic therapy and a strict supportive periodontal regimen over an observation period of 4 years. case presentation: the intraoral examination of a 17-year-old turkish female with severe plasminogen deficiency revealed generalized increased pocket probing depths ranging from 6 to 9 mm, bleeding on probing over 30%, generalized tooth mobility, and gingival hyperplasia. alveolar bone loss ranged from 30% to 50%. clinical attachment loss corresponded to pocket probing depths. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, prevotella  intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and eikenella corrodens have been detected by realtime polymerase chain reaction. periodontal treatment consisted of full mouth disinfection and adjunctive systemic administration of amoxicillin (500 mg tid) and metronidazole (400 mg tid). a strict supportive periodontal therapy regimen every three month in terms of supra- and subgingival debridement was rendered. the reported therapy has significantly improved periodontal health and arrested disease progression. intraoral examination at the end of the observation period 3.5 years after non-surgical periodontal therapy showed generalized decreased pocket probing depths ranging from 1 to 6 mm, bleeding on probing lower 30%, and  tooth mobility class i and ii. furthermore, microbiological analysis shows the absence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola after therapy. conclusion: adjunctive antibiotic treatment may alter the oral microbiome and thus, the inflammatory response of periodontal disease associated to plasminogen deficiency and diminishes the risk of pseudomembrane formation and progressive attachment loss. this case report indicates that patients with plasminogen deficiency may benefit from non-surgical periodontal treatment in combination with an adjunctive antibiotic therapy and a strict supportive periodontal therapy regimen.

TI  == increased infection with key periodontal pathogens during gestational diabetes mellitus.
AB  == aim: gestational diabetes mellitus (gdm), gingivitis, infection with specific periodontal pathogens and systemic inflammation each increase the risk for poor pregnancy outcome. we set out to monitor the interactions of gingivitis and gdm with respect to oral infection and the systemic inflammatory burden. materials and methods: four case-control groups (n = 117) were recruited, (1) no gingivitis, no gdm (n = 27); (2) gingivitis, no gdm (n = 31); (3) no gingivitis,  gdm (n = 21); and (4) gingivitis, gdm (n = 38). oral infection with three key periodontal pathogens was determined by pcr. systemic inflammation was determined by quantification of crp by eia. results: gingivitis during pregnancy was associated with oral infection with porphyromonas gingivalis, filifactor alocis and treponema denticola and combinations thereof (all p < 0.01). gdm was also associated with increased infection with individual and multiple oral pathogens (all p < 0.05). gingivitis during pregnancy led to a 325% increase in systemic crp (mean, 2495 versus 8116 ng/ml, p < 0.01). conclusions: diabetes and gingivitis act in concert to increase risk biomarkers for poor pregnancy outcome.

TI  == periodontal status and pathogenic bacteria after gastric bypass: a cohort study.
AB  == aim: the aim this study was to evaluate the influence of gastric bypass surgery (gbs) on periodontal disease and quantify the periodontopathogenic bacteria in patients undergoing this surgery. material and methods: this prospective study was composed of 50 patients who underwent bariatric surgery and the data collection was performed in three periods pre-operative, 6 (6m) and 12 months (12m) postoperative. the oral clinical examination to assess periodontal disease; gingival fluid sample collection for quantification of the periodontopathogenic bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia using q-pcr; body mass index (bmi) and for collection of the individual's health-related data from medical files. results: there was a significant reduction in serum c-reactive protein (crp) and glucose levels after  surgery. the mean probing pocket depth (ppd) and clinical attachment level (cal)  increased significantly in the postoperative period of 6 months (p = 0.001). in the same period, the amount of p. gingivalis increased (p = 0.028) and the other  bacteria decreased slightly (p > 0.050). in the presence of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, t. denticola and p. intermedia, a poor periodontal condition was observed. conclusion: the periodontal disease increased in severity and p. gingivalis increased after gbs. a systemic inflammation resolution due to bariatric surgery in obese subjects does not seem to affect the course of periodontal disease.

TI  == clinical, microbiological, and immunological aspects of healthy versus peri-implantitis tissue in full arch reconstruction patients: a prospective cross-sectional study.
AB  == background: due to the world-wide increase in treatments involving implant placement, the incidence of peri-implant disease is increasing. late implant failure is the result of the inability to maintain osseointegration, whose most important cause is peri-implantitis. the aim of this study was to analyze the clinical, microbiological, and immunological aspects in the peri-implant sulcus fluid (pisf) of patients with healthy dental implants and patients with peri-implantitis. methods: pisf samples were obtained from 24 peri-implantitis sites and 54 healthy peri-implant sites in this prospective cross-sectional study. the clinical parameters recorded were: modified gingival index (mgi), modified plaque index (mpi) and probing pocket depth (ppd). the periodontopathogenic bacteria tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola and porphyromonas gingivalis were evaluated, together with the total bacterial load (tbl). pisf samples were analyzed for the quantification of interleukin (il)-8, il-1beta, il-6, il-10 and tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha using flow cytometry  (facs). results: the mgi and ppd scores in the peri-implantitis group were significantly higher than the healthy group (p < 0.001). a total of 61.5% of the  patients with peri-implantitis had both arches rehabilitated, compared with 22.7% of patients with healthy peri-implant tissues; there was no implant with peri-implantitis in cases that received mandibular treatment exclusively (p < 0.05). concentrations of porphyromonas gingivalis (p < 0.01), association with bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola (p < 0.05), as well as  the tbl (p < 0.05) are significantly higher in the peri-implantitis group. il-1beta (p < 0.01), il-6 (p < 0.01), il-10 (p < 0.05) and tnf-alpha (p < 0.01) are significantly higher at the sites with peri-implantitis compared to healthy peri-implant tissue, while il-8 did not increase significantly. conclusion: the results of the present study involving a limited patient sample suggest that the  peri-implant microbiota and which dental arch was rehabilitated involved could contribute to bone loss in peri-implantitis. a significant relationship is observed between the concentration of cytokines (interleukins 1beta, 6 and 10 and tnf-alpha) and the inflammatory response in peri-implantitis tissue.

TI  == occurrence of periodontal pathogens in ethnic groups from a native brazilian reservation.
AB  == objective: the present study was designed to evaluate the occurrence of periodontal pathogens in the subgingival biofilm of 100 native brazilians living  at the umutina indian reservation, mato grosso state, brazil. methods: periodontal clinical examinations were carried out prior to collection of subgingival biofilm, and the presence of 14 periodontal microorganisms was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the prevalence and risk analysis was performed using cochran and mantel-haenszel statistics for dichotomous variables or pearson's chi-squared test for analysis of proportions when variables had three or more categories. the interrelations between clinical and microbiological parameters were assessed using fisher's exact test and the mann-whitney u test. results: individuals with chronic periodontitis were frequently colonized by the association between porphyromonas gingivalis and campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis and prevotella intermedia, or p. gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. patients with chronic periodontitis were also colonized by porphyromonas gulae and p. intermedia or by the association between p. gulae and t. forsythia. p. gulae was detected only in the subgingival samples from natives on a traditional diet. gingival bleeding was associated with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, t. forsythia, p.  gingivalis, p. gulae, porphyromonas endodontalis, p. intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens. treponema denticola was uncommon. conclusions: peculiar microbiota was demonstrated to be associated with different periodontal disease statuses in  native brazilians, with modest occurrence of certain pathogens, such as t. denticola, and the presence of p. gulae in natives with gingivitis or chronic periodontitis.

TI  == beta2-glycoprotein i-dependent anti-cl antibodies associated with periodonitis in sle patients.
AB  == background: it was reported that systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) patients exhibited increased levels of anti-cardiolipin (anti-cl) antibodies, a class of anti-phospholipid antibodies associated with thrombosis. beta2-glycoprotein i (beta2gpi) has been considered as the actual target antigen for anti-cl antibodies. this study investigated the association of periodontal infection with anti-cl antibodies in sle patients. methods: fifty-three sle female patients and  fifty-six healthy female volunteers were recruited in this case-control study. all participants received periodontal examinations. the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola in saliva and plaque sample was detected by polymerase chain reaction. levels of serum anti-cl and anti-beta2gpi antibodies were examined using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: sle patients  exhibited more periodontal attachment loss and increased titers of serum anti-cl  and anti-beta2gpi antibodies compared with healthy controls. active sle patients  who harboured p. gingivalis or p. gingivalis together with t. denticola intraorally exhibited significantly higher anti-cl and anti-beta2gpi antibodies than those without these bacteria. anti-cl and anti-beta2gpi antibody levels positively correlated with clinical attachment level. furthermore, increased anti-beta2gpi antibody levels were significantly associated with c-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. conclusion: elevated anti-cl and anti-beta2gpi antibody levels were associated with periodontopathic bacteria and  periodontal destruction in sle patients. periodontitis might be a modifiable risk factor for sle.

TI  == periodontal therapy effects on nitrite related to oral bacteria: a 6-month randomized clinical trial.
AB  == background: nitrite is a biological factor relevant to oral and systemic homeostasis. through an oral bacteria reduction process it was suggested that periodontal therapy and chlorhexidine rinse could impact nitrite levels leading to negative effects such as increase in blood pressure. this 6-month randomized clinical trial evaluated the effects of periodontal therapeutic protocols on salivary nitrite and its relation to subgingival bacteria. methods: 90 periodontitis patients were randomly allocated to debridement procedures in 4 weekly sections (quadrant scaling-qs) or within 24 hours (full-mouth scaling-fms) in conjunction with a 60-day chlorhexidine (chx) (qs+chx and fms+chx), placebo (qs+placebo and fms+placebo), or no mouth rinse (qs+none and fms+none) use. real-time pcr determined total bacterial, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, streptococcus oralis, and actinomyces naeslundi levels. salivary nitrite concentration was determined with griess reagent. data were statistically analyzed at baseline, 3, and 6 months by anova (analysis of variance), kruskal-wallis, mann-whitney, and spearman correlation tests (p<0.05). results: nitrite concentrations did not tend to change over time. regarding chx use, there was a negative correlation between nitrite and total bacterial load at 6 months (fms+chx) and one positive correlation between p.gingivalis and nitrite at baseline (qs+chx). independently of rinse type, in the fms group nitrite negatively correlated with several microbial parameters and also with a higher percentage of deep periodontal pockets. conclusions: the relation between nitrite and bacterial levels appear weak. short-term scaling exhibited a greater influence on nitrite concentrations then the long-term chx use.

TI  == a. actinomycetemcomitans profile and red complex bacterial species of an afro-brazilian community: a comparative study.
AB  == purposes: the primary aim of this cross-sectional study was to compare the levels of red complex bacteria between afro-brazilian and non afro-brazilian cohort. the secondary aim was to compare the distribution of both aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans serotype b and its jp2 strains among participants who harboured this bacterial species. methods: a total of 84 individuals were included in this study: 42 afro-descendants (mean age 35.9 +/- 13.1 years) and 42 non-afro-descendants (mean age 36.2 +/- 13.1 years) matched (1:1) by periodontal  diagnosis, age and gender. all participants received clinical examinations of periodontal pocket depth, clinical attachment level, and plaque and gingival indices. subgingival samples were taken for microbial analysis. first, genomic dna (gdna) was extracted and purified and the quantification of total number of bacterial cells, a. actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola was carried out by qpcr. then, a. actinomycetemcomitans strains were classified according to serotype b and jp2 profiles by conventional pcr. results: clinically, mean pd, mean cal and percentage of cal >/= 3 mm differed between groups (student's t-test p<0.05). the levels of red complex bacteria between afro-brazilian and non-afro-brazilian populations were similar. the exception was verified to a. actinomycetemcomitans  showing significantly higher levels among afro-brazilian descendants in comparison to non-afro-brazilian descendants. afro-brazilian descendants were clearly infected by more virulent serotype b and jp2 strains. conclusions: despite no statistically significant differences related to the red complex species, afro-brazilian descendants harboured higher levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans. also, our findings confirm that afro-descendant populations are preferably colonised by a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b as well as jp2 strains.

TI  == p. gingivalis in periodontal disease and atherosclerosis - scenes of action for antimicrobial peptides and complement.
AB  == according to the nhs, it is estimated that over 50% of the adult population are,  to some extent, affected by gum disease and approximately 15% of uk population have been diagnosed with severe periodontitis. periodontitis, a chronic polymicrobial disease of the gums, causes inflammation in its milder form, whereas in its severe form affects the surrounding tissues and can result in tooth loss. during periodontitis, plaque accumulates and sits between the junctional epithelium and the tooth itself, resulting in inflammation and the formation of a periodontal pocket. an interface is formed directly between the subgingival bacteria and the junctional epithelial cells. bacterial pathogens commonly associated with periodontal disease are, among others, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola, together known as the  "red complex." this review will mostly concentrate on the role of p. gingivalis,  a gram-negative anaerobic bacterium and one of the major and most studied contributors of this disease. because periodontal disease is associated with the  development of atherosclerosis, it is important to understand the local immune response to p. gingivalis. innate immune players, in particular, complement and antimicrobial peptides and their effects with regard to p. gingivalis during periodontitis and in the development of atherosclerosis will be presented.

TI  == inter- and intra-test agreement of three commercially available molecular diagnostic tests for the identification of periodontal pathogens.
AB  == objective: the aim of the study was to compare the agreement and reproducibility  of three test kits (iai pado test 4[symbol: see text]5(r), micro-ident(r), and carpegen(r) perio diagnostik) regarding the detection of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. materials and methods: periodontal plaque samples from 20  patients suffering from severe chronic or aggressive periodontitis were split into two identical batches. samples of batch 1 were evaluated immediately. samples of batch 2 were analyzed after a storage period of 2 weeks at 4 degrees c. results: the conformity of results obtained by the evaluated test kits as well as the concordant detection rate of periodontopathogens proved to be low. the agreement of the detection rate depends on the chosen test kit. the intra-test reproducibility of the qualitative analysis of identical plaque samples was perfect only for carpegen(r) perio diagnostik. the quantitative analysis of the results expressed as n-fold difference of the test results revealed an only poor  inter-test agreement between the test systems. conclusions: results of test kits  for the identification of periodontopathogens are significantly influenced by the detection technology applied. the most advanced technology tended to give the most reliable results. clinical relevance: as microbiological test results are supposed to be used for the planning of subsequent treatment strategies, clinicians should be aware of the limitations of results obtained by the different test systems and should use the results only in conjunction with clinical data for subsequent therapeutic decisions.

AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the depth of curette sample collection from periodontal lesions on the recovery of putative periodontal pathogens using real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). methods: twenty-two periodontal pockets 6 to 8 mm deep with bleeding on probing at a single-rooted tooth were sampled, yielding 66 separate samples. curette samples were obtained at three different levels of the periodontal lesion (orifice, shallow--2 mm into the pocket; or base of lesion), and processed using pcr to identify 10 periodontal pathogens. the chi-square procedure was used to determine whether probe depth affected the distribution of bacterial counts observed. a repeated measures analysis of variance tested the hypotheses related to level of  probe and microorganism on mean rank of bacterial counts. results: the effect of  probe level on mean bacterial counts depends on the type of microorganism. likewise, the effect of microorganism type on mean bacterial counts significantly depends on probe level, where sampling from 2 mm into the periodontal pocket was  found to yield significantly higher results than sampling from the orifice. overall mean counts of pathogenic microorganisms were found to differ significantly across the three probe depths. the microorganisms differed in their observed levels over all three probe levels. further analysis found several significant differences that characterize the nature of the interaction between probe level and microorganism type. conclusion: there is significant difference in the amount of putative periodontal pathogens at varying depths of the pocket when sampled with a periodontal curette.

TI  == short-term effect of removal of fixed orthodontic appliances on gingival health and subgingival microbiota: a prospective cohort study.
AB  == abstract objective. the aim of this prospective longitudinal study was to assess  and compare the microbiological and clinical parameters of patients wearing a fixed orthodontic appliance, as opposed to 10 days after the bracket had been removed following treatment. materials and methods. in total, 122 patients participated in this study; 61 of the subjects were assessed at baseline (wearing a fixed orthodontic appliance: t1) and 10 days after bracket removal (t2). the other 61 individuals had never worn an orthodontic appliance before and these subjects served as controls (ct). subgingival plaque samples were assessed for bleeding on probing (gbi) and plaque index (vpi). pcr of 16s rdna, followed by reverse species-specific hybridization for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were performed. a descriptive analysis was conducted; chi-squared, student's matched and unmatched t-tests, the point biserial correlation coefficient and the mcnemar test were used to test for differences between groups (p < 0.05). results. the gbi and vpi clinical parameters showed statistical differences (p < 0.05) between t1-t2, t1-ct and t2-ct. the prevalence of t. denticola had significantly decreased (p = 0.039) 10 days after appliance removal. at t2, a significant positive correlation was found between gbi and a. actinomycetemcomitans (p < 0.01) and between clinical parameters and p. intermedia. in patients without a fixed orthodontic appliance (t2 and ct), there  was a significant positive correlation between t. forsythia and vpi. conclusion.  local factors associated with the wearing of a fixed orthodontic appliance influence changes in subgingival plaque that leads to more inflammation and bleeding.

TI  == microbial diversity of the supra- and subgingival biofilm of healthy individuals  after brushing with chlorhexidine- or silver-coated toothbrush bristles.
AB  == nanoparticulate silver has recently been reported as an effective antimicrobial agent. the aim of this clinical study was to investigate the potential changes on the oral microbiota of healthy individuals after controlled brushing with chlorhexidine- or silver-coated toothbrush bristles. twenty-four healthy participants were enrolled in this investigation and randomly submitted to 3 interventions. all the participants received, in a crossover format, the following toothbrushing interventions: (i) chlorhexidine-coated bristles, (ii) silver-coated bristles, and (iii) conventional toothbrush (control). all the interventions had a duration of 30 days. the dna checkerboard hybridization method was used to identify and quantify up to 43 microbial species colonizing the supra- and subgingival biofilm. the supragingival samples presented higher genome counts than the subgingival samples (p < 0.0001). the total genome counts  from the control group showed the highest values, followed by the silver and chlorhexidine groups (p < 0.0001). after 4 weeks of brushing, the silver-coated and chlorhexidine-coated bristles were capable of reducing or maintaining lower levels of the bacterial counts of the putative periodontal pathogens tanerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and porphyromonas gingivalis. other major periodontal pathogens, such as prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella nigrescens, and parvimonas micra, were also detected at lower levels.  the toothbrush bristles impregnated with silver nanoparticles reduced the total and individual genome count in the supra- and subgingival biofilm after 4 weeks of brushing. chlorhexidine was not effective in reducing the total genome counts  in both supra- or subgingival biofilm after 4 weeks of brushing. chlorhexidine reduced the individual genome counts in the supragingival biofilm for most of the target species, including putative periodontal pathogens.

TI  == effects of adjunctive daily phototherapy on chronic periodontitis: a randomized single-blind controlled trial.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this randomized single-blind controlled trial was to elucidate the clinical and antimicrobial effects of daily phototherapy (pt) as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (srp) in patients with chronic periodontitis. methods: the study was conducted from december 2013 to may 2014 at ewha womans university mokdong hospital, seoul, korea. forty-one patients with mild to moderate chronic periodontitis were randomly divided into two therapeutic groups  in a 1:1 ratio: srp+pt and srp (control) groups. all participants underwent full-mouth srp. pt was performed thrice a day for a month by using electric toothbrushes with embedded light-emitting diodes. plaque index, gingival index, probing pocket depth (ppd), clinical attachment level (cal), and bleeding on probing were assessed before (baseline) and four weeks after (follow-up) the treatment. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sobrinus levels were detected by a real-time polymerase chain reaction at the same points in time. results: the clinical parameters improved in both the groups. at the follow-up assessment, ppd was significantly decreased in the srp+pt group (p=0.00). further, ppd and cal showed significantly greater changes in the srp+pt group than in the srp group (ppd, p=0.03; cal, p=0.04). p. gingivalis and t. forsythia levels decreased in this group, but no significant intergroup differences were noted. conclusions: adjunctive pt seems to have clinical benefits, but evidence of its antimicrobial  effects is not sufficient. long-term studies are necessary to develop the most effective pt protocol and compare the effectiveness of pt with and without exogenous photosensitizers.

TI  == microbial leakage at the implant/abutment connection due to implant insertion maneuvers: cross-sectional study 5 years post loading in healthy patients.
AB  == abstract the aim of this study was to test if stress on the prosthetic connection during insertion maneuvers can induce micro-warping at the implant-connection. from sept 2011 to july 20134, patients with implants loaded at least 5 years that were placed with two different insertion implant mounters - mp (conventional) and me (mountless) - were selected from all those that had received dental implant therapy in the past and coming to routine check-up or spontaneous visits during the study period. patients having implants loaded at least 5 years that were placed with two different insertion implant mounters - mp (conventional) and me (mountless) - were recruited. samples were obtained from inside the connection and the abutment surface (cias) using absorbent sterile paper tips. qrt-pcr was performed for total bacterial counts and loads of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythensis (tf), treponema denticola (td), prevotella intermedia (pi), peptostreptococcus micros (pm), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), campylobacter rectus (cr), eikenella corrodens (ec), and candida albicans (ca). the anova test  was used to test for differences. nine patients (20 implants, mp group) and 5 patients (10 implants, me group) were included. regarding the red complex, tf was seen in 80% and 30% of mp and me implants respectively (p<0.001). significant differences were also found in microbial load. for td, proportions were 45% vs. 10% (p=0.022) with no significant differences at load levels. regarding the orange complex, higher prevalence values were found in mp implants, although differences were non-significant. microbial load levels for orange complex bacteria were higher for mp than me, being these differences statistically significant for fn (4.94 vs 3.09; p=0.001). finally, ec was only detected in the  mp group, and ca and aa were not found in either group. within its limitation (small sample size, retrospective analysis, indirect measurement method), the present study suggest that aa mounter not impacting on the prosthetic connection  should be used to reduce microbial contamination of implants.

TI  == serum igg antibody levels to periodontal microbiota are associated with incident  alzheimer disease.
AB  == background: periodontitis and alzheimer disease (ad) are associated with systemic inflammation. this research studied serum igg to periodontal microbiota as possible predictors of incident ad. methods: using a case-cohort study design, 219 subjects (110 incident ad cases and 109 controls without incident cognitive impairment at last follow-up), matched on race-ethnicity, were drawn from the washington heights-inwood columbia aging project (whicap), a cohort of longitudinally followed northern manhattan residents aged >65 years. mean follow-up was five years (sd 2.6). in baseline sera, serum igg levels were determined for bacteria known to be positively or negatively associated with periodontitis (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4, treponema denticola, campylobacter rectus, eubacterium  nodatum, and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies-2). in all analyses, we used antibody threshold levels shown to correlate with presence of moderate-severe periodontitis. results: mean age was 72 years (sd 6.9) for controls, and 79 years (sd 4.6) for cases (p<0.001). non-hispanic whites comprised 26%, non-hispanic blacks 27%, and hispanics 48% of the sample. in a model adjusting for baseline age, sex, education, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking, prior history of stroke, and apolipoprotein e genotype, high anti-a. naeslundii titer (>640 ng/ml, present in 10% of subjects) was associated with increased risk of ad (hr = 2.0, 95%ci: 1.1-3.8). this association was stronger after adjusting for other significant titers (hr = 3.1, 95%ci: 1.5-6.4). in this model, high anti-e. nodatum igg (>1755 ng/ml; 19% of subjects) was associated with lower risk of ad (hr = 0.5, 95%ci: 0.2-0.9). conclusions: serum igg levels to common periodontal microbiota are associated with risk for developing incident ad.

TI  == subgingival microbial profile and production of proinflammatory cytokines in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == this review examines literature data concerning the bacterial findings in chronic periodontitis depending on pocket depth, and presents the latest published information on the presence of proinflammatory factors in periodontal environment. it has been found that chronic periodontitis affects as much as 80%  of the middle-aged population; by comparison, the prevalence of aggressive periodontitis reaches up to 1-1.5%. it is accepted that this social disease is multifactorial in etiology, but the evidence in the literature suggests that the  levels of specific gram-negative organisms in subgingival plaque biofilm play a major role in the initiation and progression of the disease. of the many bacterial species inhabiting the periodontal environment, three types--porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), treponema denticola (td), tannerella forsythia (tf)--are strongly associated with the initiation and progression of periodontitis. microbiological studies suggest that porphyromonas gingivalis should be considered a major etiologic agent. currently, porphyromonas gingivalis is strongly associated with the pathogenesis of chronic periodontitis. on the other hand, the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemeomitans in patients with chronic periodontitis may be related to the severity of the disease and thus modify the therapeutic plan. the increased amount of periodontal pathogens in the subgingival area can activate a cascade of defense mechanisms of the body associated with the production of factors causing inflammation and destruction, which suggests a correlation between the bacterial findings and the body response implemented by enhancing the local cytokine expression. studies in the literature show that the presence of certain micro-organisms in the periodontal environment  is associated to increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the gingival fluid and gingival tissue. these levels have been associated with destructive tissues response. there is little evidence in the literature on the correlation of the levels of periodontal pathogens of sites with different pocket depth with  periodontal disease activity defined by the degree of the proinflammatory cytokine expression such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin 6 (il-6).

AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between endodontic  clinical signs and symptoms and the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia or their association by multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay. materials and methods: microbial samples were taken from 30 cases with necrotic pulp tissues in primary infections. dna was extracted from the samples, which were analyzed for the presence of three endodontic pathogens by using species-specific primers. results: p. gingivalis, t. denticola, t. forsythia, and red complex were present in 11, 17, 4, and 2 canals, respectively. clinical and statistically significant relationships were found between t. forsythia and mobility and between t. denticola and swelling. (p < 0.05). presence of other red complex bacteria shows clinical association with presence of signs and symptoms but no statistically significant relationship. conclusion: the high prevalence of p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia  in the examined samples suggests that these bacteria are related to the etiology  of symptomatic periradicular diseases.

TI  == high-resolution taxonomic profiling of the subgingival microbiome for biomarker discovery and periodontitis diagnosis.
AB  == the oral microbiome plays a key role for caries, periodontitis, and systemic diseases. a method for rapid, high-resolution, robust taxonomic profiling of subgingival bacterial communities for early detection of periodontitis biomarkers would therefore be a useful tool for individualized medicine. here, we used illumina sequencing of the v1-v2 and v5-v6 hypervariable regions of the 16s rrna  gene. a sample stratification pipeline was developed in a pilot study of 19 individuals, 9 of whom had been diagnosed with chronic periodontitis. five hundred twenty-three operational taxonomic units (otus) were obtained from the v1-v2 region and 432 from the v5-v6 region. key periodontal pathogens like porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia could be  identified at the species level with both primer sets. principal coordinate analysis identified two outliers that were consistently independent of the hypervariable region and method of dna extraction used. the linear discriminant analysis (lda) effect size algorithm (lefse) identified 80 otu-level biomarkers of periodontitis and 17 of health. health- and periodontitis-related clusters of  otus were identified using a connectivity analysis, and the results confirmed previous studies with several thousands of samples. a machine learning algorithm  was developed which was trained on all but one sample and then predicted the diagnosis of the left-out sample (jackknife method). using a combination of the 10 best biomarkers, 15 of 17 samples were correctly diagnosed. training the algorithm on time-resolved community profiles might provide a highly sensitive tool to detect the onset of periodontitis.

TI  == periodontal and peri-implant microbiota in patients with healthy and inflamed periodontal and peri-implant tissues.
AB  == objective: to compare the prevalence and levels of six bacterial pathogens within the subgingival/submucosal microbiota at teeth versus implants with various clinical conditions. material and methods: twenty-two chinese were included. four subgingival/submucosal sites were selected for microbiological sampling within each subject, that is, (1) healthy peri-implant tissues; (2) peri-implantitis [ppd >/= 5 mm, presence of bleeding on probing (bop) and confirmed radiographic bone loss]; (3) healthy gingiva; and (4) periodontitis (ppd >/=4 mm). subgingival/submucosal plaque was sampled using paper points. quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (q-pcr) was used to quantify six pathogens, including porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.), treponema denticola (t.d.), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), fusobacterium nucleatum (f.n.), prevotella intermedia (p.i.), and staphylococcus aureus (s.a.). counts were log10-transformed. results: the most commonly detected species were s. a. and f.  n., while a. a. and. p. i. had the lowest detection frequency. the detection frequencies of diseased tooth or implant sites for each of the six target species were either equal to or higher than the respective frequencies at the corresponding healthy sites. there were no statistically significant differences  for any of the species or clinical sites (p > 0.05, cochran's q test). no statistically significant differences in the bacterial loads were found among the four clinical sites; with the exception of f. nucleatum. this was more abundant in periodontitis sites (p = 0.023, friedman's 2-way anova). both periodontal and  peri-implant sites, irrespective of their health status, were revealed to harbor  s. aureus cells. the log10-transformed loads of s. aureus were approximately 3.5  within each of the clinical sites (p = 0.232). this was the highest of the six species analyzed. conclusions: within the same subjects, putative periodontal pathogens were common to both periodontal and peri-implant sites irrespective of  health status. the prevalence and levels of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum were significantly associated with periodontitis, but not with peri-implantitis. a. actinomycetemcomitans was associated with both disease conditions, periodontitis  and peri-implantitis, but not with either gingival or mucosal health.

AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the subgingival prevalence of six periodontal pathogens in 352 italian patients with chronic periodontitis. possible correlations with clinical parameters, age, gender and smoking status were also investigated. at first visit a pooled subgingival plaque sample was obtained for each subject by using the paper-point method. the samples were processed and analysed according to a commercially available quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction assay (meridol(r) perio diagnostics, gaba international, switzerland). porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), treponema denticola (td), tannerella forsythia (tf), prevotella intermedia (pi), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) were investigated.  fn resulted the most frequently detected (95%) while tf showed the highest load (12x105 cells/plaque sample). aa was the less represented bacteria for load and presence. bacterial load of pg, td, tf and fn showed a direct correlation to bleeding on probing (bop) and presence of suppuration (p=0.0001). the bacterial load was always directly correlated to probing pocket depth (ppd) (p=0.0001). among the investigated variables, ppd resulted the most important risk indicator  for periodontal pathogens. bop appeared as a risk indicator for td, tf, pg detection. few studies have described the microbiological pattern of chronic periodontal disease in the italian population. considering the different forms of periodontitis, similar investigations in other countries are needed to disclose any microbiological differences among populations, which may lead to more specific approaches to prevention and therapy.

TI  == occurrence of socransky red complex in pregnant women with and without periodontal disease.
AB  == purpose: to verify the presence of socransky red complex (porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia) and p. intermedia using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) in periodontally healthy pregnant women and pregnant women with periodontal disease, as well as its relation to arterial blood pressure and capillary glycaemia. materials and methods: this case control  study included 86 pregnant women, including 50 pregnant women with healthy periodontium, 27 with gingivitis and 9 with periodontitis. arterial blood pressure and glycaemia were evaluated and recorded. clinical specimens from the gingival crevice or periodontal pockets were gathered with sterile absorbent paper cones. dna extraction was accomplished using the easy-dna kit test and the  presence of bacteria was detected by pcr with primers and specific probes for each microorganism. results: the arterial pressure of all pregnant women was found to be within normal levels and 51% presented with hyperglycaemia, these two variables were not associated with periodontal conditions and/or presence of microorganisms. socransky red complex was not present in pregnant women with healthy periodontium; however, it was present in pregnant women with gingivitis (3.7%) and in a higher percentage of pregnant women with periodontitis (33.3%). conclusion: socransky red complex was found only in cases of periodontal diseases and is not related to blood pressure and/or high levels of blood glucose.

TI  == the effect of conventional mechanical periodontal treatment on red complex microorganisms and clinical parameters in down syndrome periodontitis patients: a pilot study.
AB  == periodontal disease (pd) is induced by a complex microbiota, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola (together called the red complex), which triggers intense inflammatory reaction. down syndrome (ds) individuals demonstrate a high prevalence of pd compared with those who are otherwise chromosomally normal (euploids). this pilot study aimed to evaluate the effect of non-surgical periodontal treatment in ds chronic periodontitis patients on clinical and microbiological parameters. patients with  chronic periodontitis, 23 ds and 12 euploids (control group), were submitted to non-surgical mechanical periodontal treatment, followed by maintenance for 45 days. clinical parameters after periodontal treatment were similar in diseased and healthy sites, independent of the genetic background. diseased sites of ds and control patients harbored similar levels of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at baseline, but significantly higher levels of t. denticola were found in ds patients. increased levels of p. gingivalis at healthy sites were found in ds individuals. non-surgical periodontal therapy decreased the levels of red complex microorganisms and improved the tested clinical parameters of diseased sites in both groups. however, the levels of red complex bacteria were higher in diseased  sites of ds patients after the periodontal treatment. we conclude in this pilot study that, although the mechanical periodontal treatment seemed to be effective  in ds subjects over a short-term period, the red complex bacteria levels did not  decrease significantly in diseased sites, as occurred in controls. therefore, for ds patients, it seems that the conventional non-surgical periodontal therapy should be improved by utilizing adjuvants to reduce the presence of periodontopathogens.

TI  == effect of non-surgical periodontal treatment on short chain fatty acid levels in  gingival crevicular fluid of patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: short chain fatty acids (scfas) play important roles in periodontal diseases. however, the concentrations of scfas in gingival crevicular fluid of patients with aggressive periodontitis are not known. the aim of this intervention study was to investigate the influences of non-surgical periodontal  therapy on levels of scfas in the gingival crevicular fluid of patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis (g-agp), and analyze the concentrations of scfas in sites with or without the detected putative periodontal pathogens. material and methods: eighty gingival crevicular fluid samples (four per subject) were collected on filter paper strips from patients with g-agp (n = 20; mean age  24.5 years), before and at 2 wk, 2, 4 and 6 mo after non-surgical periodontal treatment. eighty gingival crevicular fluid samples (four per subject) were collected from periodontally healthy controls (n = 20; mean age 26.2 years). concentrations of formic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid and isovaleric acid from the supernatant of gingival crevicular fluid samples were measured by high performance capillary electrophoresis. porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum from the precipitate of the same pretreatment samples of gingival crevicular fluids were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction amplification. results: the clinical parameters of patients with g-agp during the 6 mo after non-surgical periodontal  treatment were improved remarkably. the formic acid concentration increased significantly after treatment; the level of formic acid was lower in the p. gingivalis-, t. denticola-, p. intermedia- or f. nucleatum-positive sites compared with the negative sites. the concentrations of acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid reduced significantly after treatment and reached the lowest level at 2 wk post-treatment, although showed a tendency to increase after 2 mo post-treatment, and the three scfa levels were significantly higher in p. gingivalis-, t. denticola-, p. intermedia- or f. nucleatum-positive sites compared with those in the negative sites. conclusion: non-surgical periodontal treatment resulted in a significant decrease of acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid levels and increase of formic acid level in gingival crevicular fluids in patients with g-agp, accompanied by improvement in clinical parameters. a marked lower level of formic acid, as well as higher levels of acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid in gingival crevicular fluid of patients with g-agp was consistent with periodontal pathogen infection.

TI  == role of porphyromonas gingivalis gingipains in multi-species biofilm formation.
AB  == background: periodontal diseases are polymicrobial diseases that cause the inflammatory destruction of the tooth-supporting (periodontal) tissues. their initiation is attributed to the formation of subgingival biofilms that stimulate  a cascade of chronic inflammatory reactions by the affected tissue. the gram-negative anaerobes porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola are commonly found as part of the microbiota of subgingival biofilms, and they are associated with the occurrence and severity of the disease. p. gingivalis expresses several virulence factors that may support its survival, regulate its communication with other species in the biofilm, or modulate the inflammatory response of the colonized host tissue. the most prominent of these virulence factors are the gingipains, which are a set of cysteine proteinases (either arg-specific or lys-specific). the role of gingipains in the biofilm-forming capacity of p. gingivalis is barely investigated. hence, this in vitro study employed a biofilm model consisting of 10 "subgingival" bacterial species, incorporating either a wild-type p. gingivalis strain or its derivative lys-gingipain and arg-gingipan isogenic mutants, in order to evaluate quantitative and qualitative changes in biofilm composition. results: following 64 h of biofilm growth, the levels of all 10 species were quantified by fluorescence in situ hybridization or immunofluorescence. the wild-type and the two gingipain-deficient p. gingivalis strains exhibited similar growth in their corresponding biofilms. among the remaining nine species, only the numbers of t. forsythia were significantly reduced, and only when the lys-gingipain mutant was present in the biofilm. when  evaluating the structure of the biofilm by confocal laser scanning microscopy, the most prominent observation was a shift in the spatial arrangement of t. denticola, in the presence of p. gingivalis arg-gingipain mutant. conclusions: the gingipains of p. gingivalis may qualitatively and quantitatively affect composition of polymicrobial biofilms. the present experimental model reveals interdependency between the gingipains of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia or t. denticola.

TI  == screening and development of dna aptamers specific to several oral pathogens.
AB  == aptamers are composed of single-stranded oilgonucleotides that can selectively bind desired molecules. it has been reported that rna or dna could act as not only a genetic messenger but also a catalyst in metabolic pathways. rna aptamers  (average sizes 40-50 bp) are smaller than antibodies and have strong binding capacities to target molecules, similar to antigen-antibody interactions. once an aptamer was selected, it can be readily produced in large quantities at low cost. the objectives of this study are to screen and develop aptamers specific to oral  pathogens such as porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and streptococcus mutans. the bacterial cell pellet was fixed with formaldehyde as a  target molecule for the screening of aptamers. the selex method was used for the  screening of aptamers and a modified western blot analysis was used to verify their specificities. through selex, 40 kinds of aptamers were selected and the specificity of the aptamers to the bacterial cells was confirmed by modified western blot analysis. through the selex method, 40 aptamers that specifically bind to oral pathogens were screened and isolated. the aptamers showed possibility as effective candidates for the detection agents of oral infections.

TI  == polymerase chain reaction as a prospect for the early diagnosis and prediction of periodontal diseases in adolescents.
AB  == aim: this study was to determine the markers representative of pathogenic periodontal microflora [prevotella intermedia (p.i), tannerella forsythia (t.f) [bacteroides forsythus], treponema denticola (t.d), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a), porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g)] in the dental plaque of adolescents with various degrees of severity of periodontium inflammation. methods: forty-patients aged 15-16 years of age were examined using pma, cpi and  green-vermillion indices (muller 2001). the hygiene status of each patient was also determined using durr dental's vista proof intraoral camera (germany). the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was performed using a biometra thermocycler to detect dna of pathogenic periodontal bacteria in dental plaque. results: all marker microorganisms (p.i. + t.f. + t.d. + a.a. + p.g.) were identified in patients diagnosed with periodontitis in dental plaque. a direct correlation between the level of oral hygiene and the severity of the pathological process in it was determined. it was found that the increase in the severity of the disease  was accompanied by increased pathogenic periodontal microflora in dental plaque.  conclusion: identification of periodontal pathogens in dental plaque by pcr greatly enhances the early diagnosis of cronic cattaral gingivitis (ccg) risk factors in adolescents, and allows for detailed analysis of the relation between  each factor and severity of the process. this method may be used for the diagnosis of periodontal diseases, prediction of their future course, and reasonable choice of antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == association between polycystic ovary syndrome, oral microbiota and systemic antibody responses.
AB  == polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos) is a hormonal disorder of women that not only is the leading cause of infertility but also shows a reciprocal link with oral health. this study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that the levels of putative periodontal pathogens in saliva and their antibody response in serum are elevated in pcos, compared to systemic health. a total of 125 women were included in four groups; 45 women with pcos and healthy periodontium, 35 women with pcos and gingivitis, 25 systemically and periodontally healthy women, 20 systemically  healthy women with gingivitis. salivary levels of seven putative periodontal pathogens were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and serum antibody levels were analyzed by elisa. in women with pcos, salivary porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis and tannerella forsythia levels were higher than matched systemically healthy women,  particularly in the case of gingivitis. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and treponema denticola levels were similar among study groups. the presence of pcos  also enhanced p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and s. oralis serum antibody levels, when gingivitis was also present. gingival inflammation correlated positively with levels of the studied taxa in saliva, particularly in pcos. the presence of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum in saliva also exhibited a strong positive correlation with the corresponding serum antibody levels. in conclusion, as an underlying systemic endocrine condition, pcos may quantitatively affect the composition of oral microbiota and the raised systemic response to selective members of this microbial community, exerting a confounding role in resultant gingival inflammation and periodontal health. the most consistent effect appeared to be exerted on p. gingivalis.

TI  == bacterial community composition of chronic periodontitis and novel oral sampling  sites for detecting disease indicators.
AB  == background: periodontitis is an infectious and inflammatory disease of polymicrobial etiology that can lead to the destruction of bones and tissues that support the teeth. the management of chronic periodontitis (cp) relies heavily on elimination or at least control of known pathogenic consortia associated with the disease. until now, microbial plaque obtained from the subgingival (subg) sites has been the primary focus for bacterial community analysis using deep sequencing. in addition to the use of subg plaque, here, we investigated whether  plaque obtained from supragingival (supg) and tongue dorsum sites can serve as alternatives for monitoring cp-associated bacterial biomarkers. results: using subg, supg, and tongue plaque dna from 11 healthy and 13 diseased subjects, we sequenced v3 regions (approximately 200 bases) of the 16s rrna gene using illumina sequencing. after quality filtering, approximately 4.1 million sequences were collapsed into operational taxonomic units (otus; sequence identity cutoff of >97%) that were classified to a total of 19 phyla spanning 114 genera. bacterial community diversity and overall composition was not affected by health  or disease, and multiresponse permutation procedure (mrpp) on bray-curtis distance measures only supported weakly distinct bacterial communities in subg and tongue plaque depending on health or disease status (p < 0.05). nonetheless,  in subg and tongue sites, the relative abundance of firmicutes was increased significantly from health to disease and members of synergistetes were found in higher abundance across all sites in disease. taxa indicative of cp were identified in all three locations (for example, treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, synergistes oral taxa 362 and 363). conclusions: for the first time, this study demonstrates that supg and tongue dorsum plaque can serve as alternative sources for detecting and enumerating known and novel bacterial biomarkers of cp. this finding is clinically important because, in contrast with subg sampling that requires trained professionals, obtaining plaque from supg and tongue sites is convenient and minimally-invasive and offers a novel means to track cp-biomarker organisms during treatment outcome monitoring.

TI  == the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity of one-year-old infants delivered pre-term with very low birthweights: a case control study.
AB  == background: recently, the dental literature has focused mainly on the microbial colonization of healthy full-term infants and their mothers or caretakers. however, oral microbial acquisition by premature infants has not been adequately  investigated, and the correlation between pre-term birth and the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens has not been determined. the aim of this study was to identify the presence and quantities of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavities of 12-month-old infants and compare the occurrence of these microbes between a cohort of pre-term infants with very low birthweights and a control cohort comprising full-term infants. methods: the research cohort was composed of 69 one-year-old infants, of whom 24  were born prematurely with very low birthweights and 45 of whom were carried to full term. information regarding the infants' gestational age, mode of delivery,  general health status, birthweight and antibiotic use were obtained from hospital records and through oral interviews. at 12 months of age, both groups of infants  were examined, and unstimulated saliva samples from the dorsum of the tongue and  dental plaque samples were collected. the microorganisms (streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus spp., actinomyces spp., aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum) were identified and their quantities were evaluated using a pcr-based method. the chi-squared and fisher's factorial tests were used for the statistical evaluations. results: the infants had a high prevalence of cariogenic microbes and of fusosbacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. cariogenic microbes were detected in 91.7% of the very low birthweight infants and in all full-term infants. periodontal pathogens were present in 83% of the pre-term infants and in 96% of the full-term infants. a significant difference was found between the cohorts in terms of the presence of s. mutans. most of the  very low birthweight infants had negative values of this microbe, while the full-term infants had positive values. conclusions: this study confirms the early transmission of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens to the oral cavity of one-year-old infants and a higher prevalence of s. mutans in full-term  infants than in premature infants.

TI  == periodontal bacteria in human carotid atherothrombosis as a potential trigger for neutrophil activation.
AB  == objective: epidemiological, biological and clinical links between periodontal and cardiovascular diseases are now well established. several human studies have detected bacterial dna corresponding to periodontal pathogens in cardiovascular samples. intraplaque hemorrhage has been associated with a higher risk of atherosclerotic plaque rupture, potentially mediated by neutrophil activation. in this study, we hypothesized that plaque composition may be related to periodontal pathogens. methods: carotid culprit plaque samples were collected from 157 patients. macroscopic characterization was performed at the time of collection: presence of blood, lipid core, calcification and fibrosis. markers of neutrophil  activation released by carotid samples were quantified (myeloperoxidase or mpo, cell-free dna and dna-mpo complexes). pcr analysis using specific primers for porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcommitans, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia and tannerella forsythia was used to detect dna  from periodontal pathogens in carotid tissues. in addition, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps) and immunoglobulins g against t. forsythia were quantified in atherosclerotic carotid conditioned medium. results: intraplaque hemorrhage was present in 73/157 carotid samples and was associated with neutrophil activation, reflected by the release of mpo, cell-free dna and mpo-dna complexes. lps levels were also linked to intraplaque hemorrhage but not with the neutrophil activation markers. seventy-three percent of the carotid samples were  positive for periodontal bacterial dna. furthermore, hemoglobin levels were associated with the detection of t. forsythia and neutrophil activation/inflammation markers. conclusion: this study suggests a potential role of periodontal microorganisms, especially t. forsythia, in neutrophil activation  within hemorrhagic atherosclerotic carotid plaques.

TI  == comparative genome analysis and identification of competitive and cooperative interactions in a polymicrobial disease.
AB  == polymicrobial diseases are caused by combinations of multiple bacteria, which can lead to not only mild but also life-threatening illnesses. periodontitis represents a polymicrobial disease; porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia, called 'the red complex', have been recognized as the causative agents of periodontitis. although molecular interactions among the three species could be responsible for progression of periodontitis, the relevant genetic mechanisms are unknown. in this study, we uncovered novel interactions in comparative genome analysis among the red complex species. clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crisprs) of t. forsythia might attack the  restriction modification system of p. gingivalis, and possibly work as a defense  system against dna invasion from p. gingivalis. on the other hand, gene deficiencies were mutually compensated in metabolic pathways when the genes of all the three species were taken into account, suggesting that there are cooperative relationships among the three species. this notion was supported by the observation that each of the three species had its own virulence factors, which might facilitate persistence and manifestations of virulence of the three species. here, we propose new mechanisms of bacterial symbiosis in periodontitis; these mechanisms consist of competitive and cooperative interactions. our results might shed light on the pathogenesis of periodontitis and of other polymicrobial  diseases.

TI  == pilot study on the clinical and microbiological effect of subgingival glycine powder air polishing using a cannula-like jet.
AB  == objectives: to assess the efficacy of subgingival glycine powder air polishing (gpap) during supportive periodontal therapy (spt). methods: each quadrant of 25  subjects was randomly assigned to the following treatments: subgingival scaling with hand instruments (srp), gpap, subgingival ultrasonic debridement (ud) and no subgingival treatment (nt). clinical recordings included the following: probing pocket depth (ppd), gingival recession (re), clinical attachment level (cal), gingival and plaque index. subgingival plaque samples were taken from two sites >4 mm per quadrant. therapy, recordings and microbial sampling were performed at  baseline, 3 and 6 months, while at 1 month only clinical recordings and sampling  were performed. subgingival samples were analysed using 'checkerboard' dna-dna hybridization for porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerrella forsythia and treponema denticola. results: all groups were homogeneous at baseline for the clinical parameters assessed. the gpap group displayed statistically significant higher ppd compared to srp and ud at 1, 3 and 6 months and no statistical differences with the 'no treatment' group at all time points. at 1 month, the gpap group displayed statistically significantly higher levels of cal compared to srp, while at 3 and 6 months statistically significant differences were observed with groups assigned to srp and ud. no differences were observed among groups for re, pi, gi  and numbers of the investigated bacteria at any time point. conclusions: on the basis of clinical and microbiological data, this study does not support the superiority of gpap as sole treatment over srp or subgingival ultrasonic scaling.

TI  == dentilisin involvement in coaggregation between treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia.
AB  == periodontitis arises from a biofilm consisting of gram-negative anaerobic rods and spirochetes. porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia, termed the red complex, have been co-isolated with high frequency from chronic periodontitis lesions, and these microorganisms are thought to be major pathogens of the disease. coaggregation is an important strategy in the colonization of dental plaque biofilm by these bacteria. in the present study, we investigated the coaggregation of t. denticola strains with t. forsythia atcc 43037 by use of visual grading or spectrophotometry. t. denticola atcc 35405 coaggregated with t. forsythia, reaching a plateau at approximately 60 min. this  coaggregation was inhibited by heat treatment of t. denticola atcc 35405, but not of t. forsythia. disaccharides such as sucrose, maltose, and lactose inhibited coaggregation by approximately 50%. the coaggregation reaction varied among t. denticola strains. there was somewhat less coaggregation between t. denticola atcc 33520 and t. forsythia than between t. denticola atcc 35405 and t. forsythia, although this difference was not statistically significant; t. denticola atcc 33521 showed a trace level of coaggregation with t. forsythia. the magnitude of coaggregation among the three t. denticola strains was proportional  to their dentilisin activities. inactivation of dentilisin abolished coaggregation activity, but inactivation of the major outer sheath protein did not. in addition, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride did not affect coaggregation. these results indicate that dentilisin is involved indirectly in the coaggregation between t. denticola and t. forsythia, because its proteolytic activity is not required, possibly via ligand maturation.

TI  == quantification of periodontal pathogens cell counts by capillary electrophoresis.
AB  == gingivitis is a highly prevalent periodontal disease around the worldwide. porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g), treponema denticola (t.d) and tannerela forsythia (t.f) were considered to be three important periodontal pathogens related to gingivitis, and research shows that the counts of periodontal pathogen cells in the patients before, during, and after fixed orthodontic appliance therapy were quite different. we proposed a simple method to extract the periodontal pathogens from the periodontal pocket in this work and demonstrated a new approach to determine periodontal pathogen level based on capillary electrophoresis (ce). after polymerase chain reaction amplification of p.g (197 bp), t.d (311 bp), and  t.f (641 bp), it shows that they can rapidly identified by ce within 5 min. the peak area in the eletropherogram is linearly related to the concentration of p.g, t.d, and t.f, and the correlation coefficients r(2) corresponding to them are 0.993, 0.993, and 0.956, respectively. according to this linearly relationship, the estimated concentration of p.g, t.d, and t.f in gingival crevicular fluid from one volunteer was inferred to be about 9.90x10(2), 1.48x10(3), and 9.01x10(2)cells/mul, respectively.

TI  == periodontitis in rats induces systemic oxidative stress that is controlled by bone-targeted antiresorptives.
AB  == background: periodontitis is a chronic, polymicrobial inflammatory disease that degrades connective tissue and alveolar bone and results in tooth loss. oxidative stress has been linked to the onset of periodontal tissue breakdown and systemic  inflammation, and the success of antiresorptive treatments will rely on how effectively they can ameliorate periodontal disease-induced oxidative stress during oral infection. methods: rats were infected with polybacterial inoculum consisting of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia, as an oral lavage every other week for 12 weeks. daily subcutaneous injections of enoxacin, bis-enoxacin, alendronate, or doxycycline were administered for 6 weeks after 6 weeks of polybacterial infection in rats. the serum levels of oxidative stress parameters and antioxidant enzymes, including glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase, were evaluated in each of the infected, treated, and sham-infected rats. results: rats infected with the periodontal pathogens displayed a five-fold increase in the oxidative stress index compared with controls as a result of increased levels of serum oxidants and decreases in total antioxidant activity. the overall decrease in antioxidant activity occurred despite increases in three important antioxidant enzymes, suggesting an imbalance between antioxidant macromolecules/small molecules production and antioxidant enzyme levels. surprisingly, the bone-targeted antiresorptives bis-enoxacin and alendronate inhibited increases in oxidative stress caused by periodontitis. bis-enoxacin, which has both antiresorptive and antibiotic activities, was more effective than alendronate, which acts only as an antiresorptive. conclusion: to the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that the increased oxidative stress induced by periodontal infection in rats can be ameliorated by bone-targeted antiresorptives.

TI  == effects of ginkgo biloba extract on periodontal pathogens and its clinical efficacy as adjuvant treatment.
AB  == objective: to determine the effects of ginkgo biloba extract (egb) on major periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque. methods: sixty patients with moderate to severe periodontitis were selected and randomly assigned to 3 groups: egb group, a positive (periocline) and a negative control groups. subgingival plaque samples were collected before treatment and 1 week, 2 months and 4 months  after treatment. the detection rates of 4 major periodontal pathogens-treponema denticola (td), tannerella forsythus (tf), prevotella intermedia (pi), and porphyromonas gingivalis (pg)-were detected by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). clinical indicators were examined before treatment, 3 and 6 months after treatment. results: egb significantly decreased the detection rate of all the 4 pathogens 1 week after treatment, and then gradually increased at 2 and 4 months. egb's inhibition effect was better than or comparable to periocline, except for pg in short-term. the difference of plaque index (pli) and bleeding index (bi) was not statistically significant among the groups, while for probing depth (pd)  and attachment loss (al), the difference was statistically significant between the egb group and negative control group at 3 and 6 months after treatment. conclusion: egb significantly inhibited major periodontal pathogens and can be used as an adjuvant for periodontitis treatment.

TI  == periodontopathogens and human beta-defensin-2 expression in gingival crevicular fluid from patients with periodontal disease in guangxi, china.
AB  == background and objective: periodontal diseases are often induced by periodontopathogens, which are always exposed to certain innate immune factors in gingival crevicular fluid, including human beta-defensin-2 (hbd-2). this study aims to investigate the relationship among periodontopathogens, clinical parameters and hbd-2 expression. material and methods: thirty-two healthy controls, 42 patients with chronic gingivitis and 95 patients with chronic periodontitis were recruited in guangxi, china. bleeding index, probing depth and clinical attachment level were measured for all teeth including mesiobuccal, buccal, disobuccal, mesiolingual, lingual, disolingual six sites of all patient.  gingival crevicular fluid samples were collected from the study sites. the prevalence and copy numbers (cn) of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, tannerella  forsythia and total bacteria in gingival crevicular fluid were quantified by real-time pcr. the hbd-2 concentration in gingival crevicular fluid was measured  by elisa. results: both the prevalence and the cn of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, t. denticola and t. forsythia were higher in patients with chronic periodontitis than in healthy controls and patients with chronic gingivitis; however, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of p. intermedia among the three study groups, and the highest cn was found in patients with chronic gingivitis, rather than in patients with chronic periodontitis. the loads of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. denticola and total bacteria were positively  related to probing depth, bleeding index and clinical attachment level. the concentration of hbd-2 in gingival crevicular fluid was higher in patients with chronic gingivitis and in patients with chronic periodontitis than in healthy controls. in addition, the hbd-2 concentration was positively related to the cn of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and total bacteria, as well as to bleeding index and probing depth. conclusion: the prevalence, composition and cn of periodontopathogens were closely related to the severity of periodontal disease,  and the red complex was related to the severity of clinical symptoms of periodontal diseases. the concentration of hbd-2 in gingival crevicular fluid from periodontal disease sites was higher than that in gingival crevicular fluid  from healthy sites, which suggests that hbd-2 expression might be up-regulated by periodontopathogens.

TI  == active invasion of porphyromonas gingivalis and infection-induced complement activation in apoe-/- mice brains.
AB  == periodontal disease is a polymicrobial inflammatory disease that leads to chronic systemic inflammation and direct infiltration of bacteria/bacterial components, which may contribute to the development of alzheimer's disease. apoe-/- mice were orally infected (n = 12) with porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and fusobacterium nucleatum as mono- and polymicrobial infections. apoe-/- mice were sacrificed following 12 and 24 weeks of chronic infection. bacterial genomic dna was isolated from all brain tissues except for the f. nucleatum mono-infected group. polymerase chain reaction was performed using universal 16 s rdna primers and species-specific primer sets for each organism to determine whether the infecting pathogens accessed the brain. sequencing amplification products confirmed the invasion of bacteria into the brain during infection. the innate immune responses were detected using antibodies against complement activation products of c3 convertase stage and the  membrane attack complex. molecular methods demonstrated that 6 out of 12 apoe-/-  mice brains contained p. gingivalis genomic dna at 12 weeks (p = 0.006), and 9 out of 12 at 24 weeks of infection (p = 0.0001). microglia in both infected and control groups demonstrated strong intracellular labeling with c3 and c9, due to  on-going biosynthesis. the pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus in 4 out of 12 infected mice brains demonstrated characteristic opsonization with c3 activation  fragments (p = 0.032). these results show that the oral pathogen p. gingivalis was able to access the apoe-/- mice brain and thereby contributed to complement activation with bystander neuronal injury.

TI  == bioinformatic investigation of the cost management strategies of five oral microbes.
AB  == some amino acids are more energetically costly to synthesize de novo, therefore many microbes have evolved to regulate the metabolic expenditure of the cell and  reduce the energy burden of extracellular unrecyclable proteins. several oral bacterial species take up amino acids and peptides obtained from proteolysis of host proteins and hence do not rely only on de novo synthesis. the aim of this study was to investigate if five oral bacterial species implement cost management strategies to reduce the energy burden of extracellular unrecyclable proteins. since the relative de novo amino acid synthesis costs are proportional to the masses of the amino acids, the energy costs of producing proteins were assessed by calculating the mean amino acid mass for each protein. for porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia and  streptococcus sanguinis, the outer membrane/extracellular proteins are made up of a much larger percentage of lower average mass amino acids whereas cytoplasmic proteins are made up of a larger proportion of higher average mass amino acid residues. these results are consistent with the five oral bacterial species employing energy-saving mechanisms in the production of extracellular unrecyclable proteins. interestingly, the p. gingivalis and s. sanguinis genomes  exhibited significantly lower predicted mean amino acid masses compared with those of the genomes of the other three species, suggesting that this may provide them with an energy advantage with respect to protein biosynthetic cost.

TI  == quantitative analysis of classical and new putative periodontal pathogens in subgingival biofilm: a case-control study.
AB  == background and objectives: a number of species/phylotypes have been newly implicated as putative periopathogens. the objective of this study was to explore associations among classical and new pathogens in subgingival biofilm and to assess their relative importance to chronic periodontitis. material and methods:  pooled subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 40 patients with chronic periodontitis and 40 healthy controls. taqman q-pcr assays were used to determine the absolute and relative counts of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, parvimonas micra, filifactor alocis, oral synergistetes and oral tm7s. microbial associations were assessed using cluster analysis. different statistical models were used to explore associations between  microbial parameters and periodontitis. results: the median log and relative counts were lowest for tm7s (4.4 and 0.0016%, respectively) and highest for oral  synergistetes (7.2 and 1.4%, respectively). oral synergistetes clustered strongly with the red complex, particularly t. forsythia (100% rescaled similarity). all species/phylotypes except tm7s were significantly associated with periodontitis (mann-whitney test; p </= 0.005). however, p. gingivalis and f. alocis lost association after adjusting for confounders (ordinal regression). in receiving operator characteristic curve analysis, the log counts of oral synergistetes were the best markers of periodontitis (82.5% sensitivity and specificity), followed by those of t. forsythia, p. micra and t. denticola. in prediction analysis, however, p. micra was the only microbial predictor of periodontal parameters. conclusions: oral synergistetes are presented here as new members of the red complex, with relative importance to periodontitis exceeding that of the classical members. p. micra is shown as an important periodontal pathogen warranting more attention.

TI  == rare case of generalised aggressive periodontitis in the primary dentition.
AB  == background: generalised aggressive periodontitis (ap) in the prepubescent age is  an exceptionally rare disease in the primary dentition of otherwise healthy children. characteristics of ap are gingival inflammation, deep periodontal pockets, bone loss, tooth mobility and even tooth loss. the most common way of treating this disease is the extraction of all the involved primary teeth. case report: a 4-year-old girl presented with signs of severe gingival inflammation. clinical examination revealed deep pockets, increased tooth mobility and bone loss. microbiological testing revealed the presence of a typical periopathogenic  flora consisting of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and the typical members of the red complex (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola). the patient underwent tooth extraction of all primary teeth except the primary canines, followed by thorough root debridement and treatment with systemic antibiotics (amoxicillin plus metronidazole). follow-up: regular clinical and microbiological examinations over 4 years showed no signs of recurrence of a periodontitis, even in the erupted permanent teeth. conclusion: early diagnosis and consequent early treatment of aggressive periodontitis can stop the disease and therefore avoid the development of a periodontal disease in  the permanent dentition. a close collaboration between specialists of different disciplines is required for a favourable outcome.

TI  == colonisation of gingival epithelia by subgingival biofilms in vitro: role of "red complex" bacteria.
AB  == objectives: biofilm formation on tooth surface results in colonisation and invasion of the juxtaposed gingival tissue, eliciting strong inflammatory responses that lead to periodontal disease. this in vitro study investigated the  colonisation of human gingival multi-layered epithelium by multi-species subgingival biofilms, and evaluated the relative effects of the "red complex" species (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola). methods: the grown biofilm consisted of fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, veillonella dispar, p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia, t. denticola, actinomyces oris, streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus oralis, or its variant lacking the "red complex". after 48h in co-culture with the gingival epithelia, the bacterial species in the biofilm were quantified, whereas their localisation on the cell surface was investigated by combining confocal-laser scanning microscopy (clsm) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation  (fish), as well as by scanning electron microscopy (sem). results: exclusion of the "red complex" quantitatively affected s. oralis, but not other species. the "red-complex" species were all able to colonise the gingival epithelial cells. a  co-localisation trend was observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola, as determined by fish. however, in the absence of all three "red complex" bacteria from the biofilm, an immense colonisation of streptococci (potentially s. oralis) was observed on the gingival epithelia, as confirmed by both clsm and sem. conclusions: while the "red complex" species synergise in colonizing gingival epithelia, their absence from the biofilm enhances streptococcal colonisation. this antagonism with streptococci reveals that the "red complex" may regulate biofilm virulence, with potential implications in periodontal pathogenesis.

TI  == oral inflammation, tooth loss, risk factors, and association with progression of  alzheimer's disease.
AB  == periodontitis is a polymicrobial chronic inflammatory disease of tooth-supporting tissues with bacterial etiology affecting all age groups, becoming chronic in a subgroup of older individuals. periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola are implicated in the development of a number of inflammatory pathologies at remote organ sites, including alzheimer's disease (ad). the initial inflammatory hypothesis proposed that ad hallmark proteins were the main contributors of central nervous system (cns) inflammation. this hypothesis is expanding to include the role of infections, lifestyle, and genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of ad. periodontal disease (pd) typifies a condition that encompasses all of the above factors including pathogenic bacteria. these bacteria not only are the source of  low-grade, chronic infection and inflammation that follow daily episodes of bacteremia arising from everyday tasks such as brushing, flossing teeth, chewing  food, and during dental procedures, but they also disseminate into the brain from closely related anatomical pathways. the long-term effect of inflammatory mediators, pathogens, and/or their virulence factors, reaching the brain systemically or otherwise would, over time, prime the brain's own microglia in individuals who have inherent susceptibility traits. such susceptibilities contribute to inadequate neutralization of invading agents, upon reaching the brain. this has the capacity to create a vicious cycle of sustained local inflammatory milieu resulting in the loss of cytoarchitectural integrity and vital neurons with subsequent loss of function (deterioration in memory). the possible pathways between pd and ad development are considered here, as well as environmental factors that may modulate/exacerbate ad symptoms.

TI  == expression and regulation of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 in  periodontal diseases.
AB  == periodontitis is an inflammatory infectious disease that destroys the tooth-supporting tissues. it is caused by multi-species subgingival biofilms that colonize the tooth surface. porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia (i.e. 'red complex' bacteria) are characteristic subgingival biofilm species. the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (trem-1) is a cell surface receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily, with a role in the amplification of proinflammatory cytokine production during infection. this study aimed to investigate trem-1 mrna expression in gingival tissues from patients with chronic periodontitis, generalized aggressive periodontitis and healthy subjects and its correlation with the levels of periodontal pathogens in the tissue. a further aim was to investigate the regulation of trem-1 in human monocytic cells (mm6) challenged with an in-vitro subgingival biofilm model. gingival tissue trem-1 expression was increased in both chronic and aggressive periodontitis, compared to health, and correlated with the levels of the 'red complex' species in the tissue. no significant differences were detected between  the two forms of periodontitis. biofilm-challenged mm6 cells exhibited higher trem-1 expression and secretion compared to controls, with partial involvement of the 'red complex'. engagement or inhibition of trem-1 affected the capacity of the biofilms to stimulate interleukin (il)-1beta, but not il-8, secretion by the  cells. in conclusion, this study reveals that trem-1 tissue expression is enhanced in periodontal disease, and correlates with the level of periodontal pathogens. it also provides a mechanistic insight into the regulation of trem-1 expression and the associated il-1beta production in biofilm-challenged monocytes.

TI  == relationship between expression of human gingival beta-defensins and levels of periodontopathogens in subgingival plaque.
AB  == background and objective: human beta-defensins (hbds) are a group of antimicrobial peptides important in epithelial innate immunity, and their differential expression is associated with periodontal diseases. the aim of this  study was to explore relationships among hbds, total subgingival bacteria and periodontopathogens in healthy subjects and in patients with chronic periodontitis. material and methods: the periodontal clinical parameters of 29 healthy subjects and 25 patients with chronic periodontitis were recorded. the relative expression of hbd1, hbd2 and hbd3 genes in gingival biopsies was measured using real-time pcr. the numbers of total bacteria and of treponema denticola, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and tannerella forsythia in subgingival plaque were quantified by real-time pcr. data were analyzed using the mann-whitney u-test and spearman's rank correlation test. results: no significant differences in expression of the hbd genes were found between the group of healthy subjects and  the group of patients with chronic periodontitis. total bacteria and t. denticola were detected in all participants. f. nucleatum and t. forsythia were detected in all patients with chronic periodontitis and in 86.21% and 51.72%, respectively, of healthy volunteers. p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans were detected in 24.14% and 17.24%, respectively, of the healthy group and in 84.00% and 12.00%, respectively, of the chronic periodontitis group. the prevalence of all bacteria, except a. actinomycetemcomitans, was significantly higher in the group  of patients with chronic periodontitis than in the group of healthy subjects (p < 0.05). a significant, negative correlation was observed between total bacteria and hbd-2 (r = -0.384, p = 0.011). upon analyzing the data in different groups, total bacteria and hbd-2 were significantly correlated (r = -0.492, p = 0.026) only in the group of healthy subjects. conclusion: the negative correlations between hbd-2 and total bacteria, especially in the group of healthy subjects, indicate that hbds may play an important role by limiting an increase of bacterial load at the initial stage of periodontitis.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis: major periodontopathic pathogen overview.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is a gram-negative oral anaerobe that is involved in the pathogenesis of periodontitis and is a member of more than 500 bacterial species  that live in the oral cavity. this anaerobic bacterium is a natural member of the oral microbiome, yet it can become highly destructive (termed pathobiont) and proliferate to high cell numbers in periodontal lesions: this is attributed to its arsenal of specialized virulence factors. the purpose of this review is to provide an overview of one of the main periodontal pathogens-porphyromonas gingivalis. this bacterium, along with treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia, constitute the "red complex," a prototype polybacterial pathogenic consortium in periodontitis. this review outlines porphyromonas gingivalis structure, its metabolism, its ability to colonize the epithelial cells, and its  influence upon the host immunity.

TI  == genetic characteristics and pathogenic mechanisms of periodontal pathogens.
AB  == periodontal disease is caused by a group of bacteria that utilize a variety of strategies and molecular mechanisms to evade or overcome host defenses. recent research has uncovered new evidence illuminating interesting aspects of the virulence of these bacteria and their genomic variability. this paper summarizes  some of the strategies utilized by the major species - aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and porphyromonas gingivalis - implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. whole-genome sequencing of 14 diverse a. actinomycetemcomitans strains has revealed variations in their genetic content (ranging between 0.4% and 19.5%) and organization. strikingly, isolates from human periodontal sites showed no genomic changes during persistent colonization. t. forsythia manipulates the cytokine responses of macrophages and monocytes through its surface glycosylation. studies have revealed that bacterial surface-expressed o-linked glycans modulate t-cell responses during periodontal inflammation. periodontal pathogens belonging to the "red complex" consortium express neuraminidases, which enables them to scavenge sialic acid from host glycoconjugates. analysis of recent data has demonstrated that the cleaved sialic acid acts as an important nutrient for bacterial growth and a molecule for the decoration of bacteria surfaces to help evade the host immune attack. in addition, bacterial entry into host cells is also an important  prerequisite for the lifestyle of periodontal pathogens such as p. gingivalis. studies have shown that, after its entry into the cell, this bacterium uses multiple sorting pathways destined for autophagy, lysosomes, or recycling pathways. in addition, p. gingivalis releases outer membrane vesicles which enter cells via endocytosis and cause cellular functional impairment.

TI  == assessment of periodontal and opportunistic flora in patients with peri-implantitis.
AB  == aim: to assess the presence of periodontal and opportunistic organisms in patients with peri-implantitis. material and methods: thirty-three partially edentulous subjects (22 women, 11 men), aged 32-90 years, who had one or more implants with peri-implantitis were included. peri-implantitis was defined as: (i) the presence of bleeding on probing and/or suppuration and (ii) radiographic  images showed marginal bone loss >1.8 mm after 1 year in function. criteria for inclusion were: (i) partially edentulous patients having at least one implant diagnosed with peri-implantitis; (ii) no antibiotic therapy for 6 months prior to clinical examination. following this definition, a total of 48 implants were diagnosed with peri-implantitis. subgingival bacterial samples were obtained with sterile paper points from infected implants and selected teeth of each individual. periodontopathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) were detected by multiplex pcr targeting 16s rdna. samples were placed in reduced transport medium and cultured for opportunistic pathogens  (staphylococcus aureus, enteric bacteria, pseudomonas and yeasts). results: twenty-two patients yielded positive results for p. gingivalis, 25 for t. forsythia, eight for p. intermedia and 13 for t. denticola. none of the patients  yielded a positive result for a. actinomycetemcomitans. non-periodontal species were found in five patients (15% of total). p. aeruginosa was found in four (12%) patients, and c. albicans (3%) and s. aureus in one patient (3%) each. in two cases of peri-implantitis, none of the periodontal or opportunistic microorganisms studied were detected in either implant or tooth samples. when results of the periodontopathic bacteria from the implant and tooth samples of the same patient were compared, 18 patients (54%) showed the same results for both samples and 15 (45%) patients different results. conclusions: the implant surface may be colonized with pathogens different from periodontal bacteria. opportunistic pathogens such as p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and c. albicans may be associated with implant failure.

AB  == objective: to evaluate the bacterial microflora present inside the implant connection and in the peri-implant sulcus fluid of healthy implants, and to analyze the relationships between these harboring sites for four different implant systems after at least 5 years of functional loading. materials and methods: a cross-sectional study was performed involving 40 patients treated with metal-ceramic cemented bridges supported by at least two healthy implants functionally loaded for 5 years. four different implant-abutment connections were studied: external hexagon (control group), double internal hexagon (test group 1), internal hexagon with external collar (test group 2), and conical connection  (test group 3). samples for microbiological analysis were obtained from three types of sites: peri-implant sulci, connections' inside and abutments surface and, as control, gingival sulci of neighboring teeth. quantitative real-time pcr  was carried out for total bacterial count and for 10 microorganisms: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, and candida albicans. the response variables were percentage of positive sites and absolute bacterial load. the relations of the response variables with the type of connection and of sampling site were assessed using generalized estimating equations. results: regarding the analysis of positivity to bacteria in the peri-implant sulcus no significant differences were observed. analyzing the connection's inside, none of the connection designs had the capacity to prevent microbiological leakage through the implant/abutment microgap. test group 3 presented the lowest mean values for red complex bacteria and control group the highest, although differences were non-significant. statistical significance was  only reached for treponema denticola in the bacterial load analysis inside the connection. test groups 1 and 2 yielded lower values for orange complex bacteria  but only for peptostreptococos micros the differences resulted significant. test  groups 2 and 3 had significantly lower total bacterial counts in the peri-implant sulcus and inside the connection. conclusions: outcomes suggested that all the analyzed connections resulted contaminated after 5 years of functional loading. however, the connection design might influence bacterial activity levels qualitatively and quantitatively, especially inside the implant connection.

TI  == gingival tissue transcriptomes identify distinct periodontitis phenotypes.
AB  == the currently recognized principal forms of periodontitis-chronic and aggressive-lack an unequivocal, pathobiology-based foundation. we explored whether gingival tissue transcriptomes can serve as the basis for an alternative  classification of periodontitis. we used cross-sectional whole-genome gene expression data from 241 gingival tissue biopsies obtained from sites with periodontal pathology in 120 systemically healthy nonsmokers with periodontitis,  with available data on clinical periodontal status, subgingival microbial profiles, and serum igg antibodies to periodontal microbiota. adjusted model-based clustering of transcriptomic data using finite mixtures generated two distinct clusters of patients that did not align with the current classification  of chronic and aggressive periodontitis. differential expression profiles primarily related to cell proliferation in cluster 1 and to lymphocyte activation and unfolded protein responses in cluster 2. patients in the two clusters did not differ with respect to age but presented with distinct phenotypes (statistically  significantly different whole-mouth clinical measures of extent/severity, subgingival microbial burden by several species, and selected serum antibody responses). patients in cluster 2 showed more extensive/severe disease and were more often male. the findings suggest that distinct gene expression signatures in pathologic gingival tissues translate into phenotypic differences and can provide a basis for a novel classification.

TI  == bis-enoxacin blocks rat alveolar bone resorption from experimental periodontitis.
AB  == periodontal diseases are multifactorial, caused by polymicrobial subgingival pathogens, including porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia. chronic periodontal infection results in inflammation, destruction of connective tissues, periodontal ligament, and alveolar bone resorption, and ultimately tooth loss. enoxacin and a bisphosphonate derivative of enoxacin (bis-enoxacin) inhibit osteoclast formation and bone resorption and also contain antibiotic properties. our study proposes that enoxacin and/or bis-enoxacin may be useful in reducing alveolar bone resorption and possibly bacterial colonization. rats were infected with 10(9) cells of polymicrobial inoculum consisting of p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia, as an oral  lavage every other week for twelve weeks. daily subcutaneous injections of enoxacin (5 mg/kg/day), bis-enoxacin (5, 25 mg/kg/day), alendronate (1, 10 mg/kg/day), or doxycycline (5 mg/day) were administered after 6 weeks of polymicrobial infection. periodontal disease parameters, including bacterial colonization/infection, immune response, inflammation, alveolar bone resorption,  and systemic spread, were assessed post-euthanasia. all three periodontal pathogens colonized the rat oral cavity during polymicrobial infection. polymicrobial infection induced an increase in total alveolar bone resorption, intrabony defects, and gingival inflammation. treatment with bis-enoxacin significantly decreased alveolar bone resorption more effectively than either alendronate or doxycycline. histologic examination revealed that treatment with bis-enoxacin and enoxacin reduced gingival inflammation and decreased apical migration of junctional epithelium. these data support the hypothesis that bis-enoxacin and enoxacin may be useful for the treatment of periodontal disease.

TI  == peri-implant response and microflora in organ transplant patients 1 year after prosthetic loading: a prospective controlled study.
AB  == background: a recent study conducted in humans demonstrated for the first time that bone loss in the immediate period after implant insertion before loading did not significantly differ in organ transplant recipients with respect to normal subjects. purpose: the purpose of this study is to evaluate bone and periodontal  response and peri-implant microflora in a group of organ-transplanted patients 1  year after prosthetic loading. materials and methods: the study population included 13 consecutive organ-transplanted (11 hearts, two livers) patients and 13 normal (healthy) control subjects who received 29 and 28 submerged dental implants, respectively. crestal bone level, peri-implant probing depth (pipd), and bleeding on probing were evaluated at prosthetic loading and after 1 year. samples for microbiological testing were taken from the subgingival microbiota of each implant 1 year after loading and analyzed with polymerase chain reaction. all samples were examined for the presence of five microorganisms: treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannarella forsythensis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. results: a mean bone loss of 0.17 +/- 0.10 and 0.20 +/- 0.10 mm at 1 year was observed in the group of transplant recipients and in controls, respectively (n.s.). similar results were  obtained considering pipd changes at 1 year (respectively 0.06 +/- 0.71 mm in transplants vs 0.11 +/- 0.74 mm in controls). detection frequencies of pathogens  were not statistically different between normal and transplanted patients. conclusions: the present pilot study seems to indicate that bone and periodontal  response and microbiological status around submerged dental implants in immunocompromised organ-transplanted patients do not differ 1 year after loading  from those observed in control patients and that this particular population of patients may be successfully rehabilitated with dental implants.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola exhibit metabolic symbioses.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola are strongly associated with chronic periodontitis. these bacteria have been co-localized in subgingival plaque and demonstrated to exhibit symbiosis in growth in vitro and synergistic virulence upon co-infection in animal models of disease. here we show that during continuous co-culture a p. gingivalis:t. denticola cell ratio of 6ratio1 was maintained with a respective increase of 54% and 30% in cell numbers when compared with mono-culture. co-culture caused significant changes in global gene  expression in both species with altered expression of 184 t. denticola and 134 p. gingivalis genes. p. gingivalis genes encoding a predicted thiamine biosynthesis  pathway were up-regulated whilst genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis were down-regulated. t. denticola genes encoding virulence factors including dentilisin and glycine catabolic pathways were significantly up-regulated during  co-culture. metabolic labeling using 13c-glycine showed that t. denticola rapidly metabolized this amino acid resulting in the production of acetate and lactate. p. gingivalis may be an important source of free glycine for t. denticola as mono-cultures of p. gingivalis and t. denticola were found to produce and consume free glycine, respectively; free glycine production by p. gingivalis was stimulated by t. denticola conditioned medium and glycine supplementation of t. denticola medium increased final cell density 1.7-fold. collectively these data show p. gingivalis and t. denticola respond metabolically to the presence of each other with t. denticola displaying responses that help explain enhanced virulence of co-infections.

TI  == major membrane protein tde2508 regulates adhesive potency in treponema denticola.
AB  == the cultivation and genetic manipulation of treponema denticola, a gram-negative  oral spirochaeta associated with periodontal diseases, is still challenging. in this study, we formulated a simple medium based on a commercially available one,  and established a transformation method with high efficiency. we then analyzed proteins in a membrane fraction in t. denticola and identified 16 major membrane-associated proteins, and characterized one of them, tde2508, whose biological function was not yet known. although this protein, which exhibited a complex conformation, was presumably localized in the outer membrane, we did not  find conclusive evidence that it was exposed on the cell surface. intriguingly, a tde2508-deficient mutant exhibited significantly increased biofilm formation and  adherent activity on human gingival epithelial cells. however, the protein deficiency did not alter autoaggregation, coaggregation with porphyromonas gingivalis, hemagglutination, cell surface hydrophobicity, motility, or expression of msp which was reported to be an adherent molecule in this bacteria. in conclusion, the major membrane protein tde2508 regulates biofilm formation and the adhesive potency of t. denticola, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear.

TI  == prevelance of periodontopathogenic bacteria in subgingival biofilm and atherosclerotic plaques of patients undergoing coronary revascularization surgery.
AB  == aim: the objective of the present study was to detect the presence of specific periodontopathogenic bacteria in the coronary plaque of patients with coronary artery disease and to find out the significant association between the periodontal status and the presence of pathogenic bacteria in the coronary plaque. materials and methods: the study population consisted of 51 patients with chronic generalized periodontitis undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. periodontal parameters were recorded and deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted from the subgingival plaque and coronary atherosclerotic plaque samples of the same patients. polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the part of 16s ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rrna) gene to detect the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), tannerella forsythia (tf), porphyromonas gingivali (pg), porphyromonas gingivalis (fima) gene and treponema denticola (td). results: aa, tf, pg, pg (fima) gene and td were detected in 0%, 31.4%, 45.1% 39.2% and 51% of atherosclerotic plaque samples, respectively. tf was detected in 19.6%, pg in  39.2%, pg (fima) gene in 33.3% and td in 35.3% of both, subgingival plaque and atherosclerotic plaque samples. periodontal parameters correlated with the presence of bacteria in coronary plaque. aa could not be detected in coronary plaque samples. conclusions: the study confirmed the detection of red complex bacteria in coronary plaque samples and these bacteria correlated with the severity of periodontal destruction.

TI  == subgingival plaque sampling after combined mechanical and antibiotic nonsurgical  periodontal therapy.
AB  == aim: this study aimed to make a comparison of two sampling strategies of subgingival plaque after combined mechanical-antibiotic periodontal therapy. methods: thirty patients (18 female) suffering from aggressive (n = 12) or generalised severe chronic (n = 18) periodontitis were included. aggregatibacter  actinomycetemcomitans had been detected subgingivally in all prior to anti-infective therapy (at) and combined mechanical-antibiotic at had been rendered. after at clinical examinations were performed and subgingival plaque was sampled from the same four sites as prior to at (aspre) as well as from the four deepest sites after at (deep). per patient two pooled samples (aspre/deep) were generated and analysed for a. actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola using a commercial 16s rrna test. results: aspre failed to detect a. actinomycetemcomitans, deep detected a. actinomycetemcomitans only in two patients (7 %). only for t. forsythia deep (53 %) provided higher detection frequencies than aspre (27 %; p = 0.005). detection frequencies of p. gingivalis and t. denticola ranged from 47 to 53 %. conclusion: after combined mechanical-antibiotic at sampling the deepest sites revealed higher detection rates. combined mechanical-antibiotic at suppresses a. actinomycetemcomitans to a higher extent than p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and t. denticola.

TI  == subgingival periodontal pathogens associated with chronic periodontitis in yemenis.
AB  == background: subgingival microbial profile associated with periodontitis has been  reported to significantly differ by geographical location. the purpose of this study was to assess the association between a panel of putative periodontal bacterial pathogens and chronic periodontitis among yemenis. methods: subgingival dna samples were obtained from diseased and healthy sites of 20 non-smoking, moderate to severe chronic periodontitis subjects. absolute counts (bacterial dna copies per sample) and relative counts (% total bacteria) of seven periopathogenic species/genera representative of the red and orange complexes were determined using taqman q-pcr assays. results: the q-pcr assays showed excellent linearity (r2 > 0.99) and a sensitivity of 100 copies/sample. the detection rate was 100% for all tested species/genera except for p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans that were detected at 97.5% and 67.5%, respectively. the median log absolute counts were in the range of 2.41-6.53 copies per sample while median relative counts were in the range of 0.001-0.77%, both being highest for fusobacteria and lowest for a. actinomycetemcomitans. significant interspecies correlations were observed. adjusting for multiple comparisons (p</=0.0063), only t. forsythia, t. denticola and p. micra maintained significant association with periodontal destruction. the latter species, however, showed the strongest association and was found in higher proportions at the periodontitis sites across all subjects (3.39 median fold increase). no significant differences were observed for p. gingivalis. conclusions: p. micra rather than p. gingivalis  appears as a keystone pathogen in this yemeni sample. however, these findings need to be validated in a larger-scale study before they can be claimed to represent ethnic variations in pathogens' association with periodontitis.

TI  == transcriptional responses of treponema denticola to other oral bacterial species.
AB  == the classic organization by socransky and coworkers categorized the oral bacteria of the subgingival plaque into different complexes. treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia are grouped into the red complex that is highly correlated with periodontal disease. socransky's work closely associates red with orange complex species such as fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia but not with members of the other complexes.  while the relationship between species contained by these complexes is in part supported by their ability to physically attach to each other, the physiological  consequences of these interactions and associations are less clear. in this study, we employed t. denticola as a model organism to analyze contact-dependent  responses to interactions with species belonging to the same complex (p. gingivalis and t. forsythia), the closely associated orange complex (using f. nucleatum and p. intermedia as representatives) and the unconnected yellow complex (using streptococcus sanguinis and s. gordonii as representatives). rna was extracted from t. denticola alone as well as after pairwise co-incubation for 5 hrs with representatives of the different complexes, and the respective gene expression profiles were determined using microarrays. numerous genes related to  motility, metabolism, transport, outer membrane and hypothetical proteins were differentially regulated in t. denticola in the presence of the tested partner species. further analysis revealed a significant overlap in the affected genes and we identified a general response to the presence of other species, those specific to two of the three complexes as well as individual complexes. most interestingly, many predicted major antigens (e.g. flagella, msp, ctlp) were suppressed in responses that included red complex species indicating that the presence of the most closely associated species induces immune-evasive strategies. in summary, the data presented here provide an in-depth understanding of the transcriptional responses triggered by contact-dependent interactions between microorganisms inhabiting the periodontal pocket.

TI  == 16s rdna-based metagenomic analysis of dental plaque and lung bacteria in patients with severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  == background and objective: acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ae-copd) are leading causes of mortality in hospital intensive care units. we sought to determine whether dental plaque biofilms might harbor pathogenic bacteria that can eventually cause lung infections in patients with severe ae-copd. material and methods: paired samples of subgingival plaque biofilm and tracheal aspirate were collected from 53 patients with severe ae-copd. total bacterial dna was extracted from each sample individually for polymerase chain reaction amplification and/or generation of bacterial 16s rdna sequences and cdna libraries. we used a metagenomic approach, based on bacterial  16s rdna sequences, to compare the distribution of species present in dental plaque and lung. results: analysis of 1060 sequences (20 clones per patient) revealed a wide range of aerobic, anaerobic, pathogenic, opportunistic, novel and uncultivable bacterial species. species indistinguishable between the paired subgingival plaque and tracheal aspirate samples (97-100% similarity in 16s rdna  sequence) were dental plaque pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) and lung pathogens (acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pneumoniae). real-time polymerase chain reaction of 16s rdna indicated lower levels of pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis colonizing the dental plaques compared with the paired tracheal aspirate samples. conclusion: these results support the  hypothesis that dental bacteria may contribute to the pathology of severe ae-copd.

AB  == objective: red complex bacteria (treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia and porphyromonas gingivalis) play a major role in the aetiology of periodontal disease in humans. this study was designed to evaluate the association of such bacteria with periodontal disease in dogs. methods: seventy-three subgingival samples taken from dogs ranging from 2 months to 12 years (median age 4 years) were tested for red complex bacteria using a polymerase chain reaction assay. results: thirty-six of 73 (49 . 3%) dogs were found to be positive for t. forsythia and p. gingivalis. dogs with gingivitis or periodontitis were more likely to be infected with t. forsythia and p. gingivalis [odds ratio (or) 5 . 4  (confidence interval (ci) 1 . 9-15 . 6), p = 0 . 002] than healthy animals. only  3 (4 . 1%) of 73 samples were positive for red complex bacteria, but the association with periodontal disease was not significant. conclusion and clinical relevance: the results indicate that involvement of red complex bacteria in periodontal disease in dogs is similar to that observed in humans. only the concurrent presence of t. forsythia and p. gingivalis were correlated to periodontal disease in dogs in this study.

TI  == the effects of different orthodontic appliances upon microbial communities.
AB  == objectives: orthodontic appliances can promote accumulation of dental plaque, with associated enamel decalcification or gingival inflammation. the aim of this  study was to examine longer-term microbiological changes during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. materials and methods: twenty-four orthodontic patients aged 11-14 years undergoing fixed appliance therapy were recruited into  the study. each was randomized for cross-mouth assignment of molar bands and bonded molar tubes to contralateral quadrants of the mouth. all patients received self-ligating brackets, but again using randomization, one upper lateral incisor  bracket (left or right) also received an elastomeric ligature. plaque samples from the molars and upper lateral incisors were obtained at intervals during treatment and up to 1 year after appliance removal. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16s rdna microarray were used to compare plaque microbial fingerprints. results: plaque populations changed within 3 months of commencing treatment at all sites. the greatest differences in plaque composition were seen  with self-ligating brackets with an elastomeric ligature. post-treatment plaque associated with both types of molar attachment contained increased levels of periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and eubacterium nodatum, while campylobacter rectus, parvimonas micra, and actinomyces odontolyticus were also elevated with bonds. conclusions: the results suggest that orthodontic treatment may cause sustained changes in plaque microbiotas and that molar bond-associated plaque may have raised disease potential.

TI  == impact of early colonizers on in vitro subgingival biofilm formation.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of early colonizing species on the structure and the composition of the bacterial community developing in a subgingival 10-species biofilm model system. the model included streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, actinomycesoris, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp.  nucleatum, veillonella dispar, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. based on literature, we considered streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, and actinomyces oris as early colonizers and examined their role in the biofilms by either a delayed addition to the consortium, or by not inoculating at all the biofilms with these species. we quantitatively evaluated the resulting biofilms by real-time quantitative pcr and further compared the structures using confocal  laser scanning microscopy following fluorescence in situ hybridisation. the absence of the early colonizers did not hinder biofilm formation. the biofilms reached the same total counts and developed to normal thickness. however, quantitative shifts in the abundances of individual species were observed. in the absence of streptococci, the overall biofilm structure appeared looser and more dispersed. moreover, besides a significant increase of p. intermedia and a decrease of p. gingivalis , p. intermedia appeared to form filamented long chains that resembled streptococci. a. oris, although growing to significantly higher abundance in absence of streptococci, did not have a visible impact on the biofilms. hence, in the absence of the early colonizers, there is a pronounced effect on p. intermedia and p. gingivalis that may cause distinct shifts in the structure of the biofilm. streptococci possibly facilitate the establishment of p. gingivalis into subgingival biofilms, while in their absence p. intermedia became more dominant and forms elongated chains.

TI  == interleukin-8 responses of multi-layer gingival epithelia to subgingival biofilms: role of the "red complex" species.
AB  == periodontitis is an infectious inflammatory disease that results in the destruction of the tooth-supporting (periodontal) tissues. the gram-negative anaerobic species porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola, (also known as the "red complex" species) are highly associated with subgingival biofilms at periodontitis-affected sites. a major chemokine produced  by the gingival epithelium in response to biofilm challenge, is interleukin (il)-8. the aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the relative effect of  the "red complex" species as constituents of subgingival biofilms, on the regulation of il-8 by gingival epithelia. multi-layered organotypic human gingival epithelial cultures were challenged with a 10-species in vitro subgingival biofilm model, or its 7-species variant, excluding the "red complex". il-8 gene expression and secretion analyses were performed by qpcr and elisa, respectively. after 3 h, both biofilms up-regulated il-8 gene expression, but the presence of the "red complex" resulted in 3-fold greater response. il-8 secretion was also up-regulated by both biofilms, with no differences between them. after 24 h, the 10-species biofilm reduced il-8 secretion to 50% of the control, but this was not affected when the "red complex" was absent. in conclusion, as part of biofilms, "red complex" species differentially regulate il-8 in gingival epithelia, potentially affecting the chemotactic responses of the tissue.

TI  == biology and pathogenesis of cytomegalovirus in periodontal disease.
AB  == human periodontitis is associated with a wide range of bacteria and viruses and with complex innate and adaptive immune responses. porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, cytomegalovirus and other herpesviruses are major suspected pathogens of periodontitis, and a combined herpesvirus-bacterial periodontal infection can potentially explain major clinical features of the disease. cytomegalovirus infects periodontal macrophages and t-cells and elicits a release of interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. these proinflammatory cytokines play an important role in the host defense against the virus, but they  also have the potential to induce alveolar bone resorption and loss of periodontal ligament. gingival fibroblasts infected with cytomegalovirus also exhibit diminished collagen production and release of an increased level of matrix metalloproteinases. this article reviews innate and adaptive immunity to cytomegalovirus and suggests that immune responses towards cytomegalovirus can play roles in controlling, as well as in exacerbating, destructive periodontal disease.

TI  == oral prophylaxis and its effects on halitosis-associated and inflammatory parameters in patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == objective: a controlled clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of oral prophylaxis on halitosis-associated, immunological and microbiological parameters. methods: thirty subjects were included in this controlled clinical trial (patients with generalized chronic periodontitis and controls without clinical attachment loss; each n = 15). before oral prophylaxis and 14 days after (including tongue cleaning) volatile sulphur compounds (vsc), organoleptic scores and a tongue coating index were evaluated. the levels of il-1beta, il-8, il-10 and mmp-8 were measured in gcf, and also major periodontal pathogens were detected. data were statistically analysed using anova and paired t-test. results: supragingival plaque and calculus removal with combined tongue cleaning  was able to reduce significantly (p < 0.05) the vsc values in both groups (no significant differences between both groups). two weeks after periodontal debridement, the vsc values were observed in the periodontitis group, but not in  the control group, similar to the baseline values. the difference between the groups was statistically significant (p < 0.05). only a repeated prophylaxis session in the periodontitis group was able to reduce vsc values significantly in comparison with baseline (p < 0.05). organoleptic scores (10 and 30 cm) were significantly different (p < 0.05) between both groups before and after the treatment. periodontal pathogens and host-derived markers were not significantly  affected by a single prophylaxis session. conclusions: oral prophylaxis may result in a significant decrease in vsc values. however, in periodontal diseases, a more complex treatment seems to be necessary.

TI  == smoking-related cotinine levels and host responses in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: smoking has been reported to increase the risk of periodontal disease by disrupting the balance of immune responses and tissue repair processes; however, this risk varies among smokers. cotinine levels in saliva are routinely used to measure the level of smoking, and reflect the quantity of nicotine, and other smoking-related xenobiotics that challenge host systems. this study delineated characteristics of inflammatory mediators in saliva and serum antibody responses to both periodontal pathogens and commensal bacteria in smokers as they related to cotinine levels. materials and methods: this case-control study (n = 279) examined salivary inflammatory mediator responses [interleukin (il)-1ss, il-10, prostaglandin e2, myeloperoxidase and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1], and serum igg antibody responses to three periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomyce-temcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola) and five commensal oral microorganisms (veillonella parvula, streptococcus sanguis, prevotella loescheii, actinomyces naeslundii, capnocytophaga ochracea). results: the patients were stratified into  health (n = 30), gingivitis (n = 55) and periodontitis (n = 184); cotinine levels correlated with reported smoking habits in health, less so with gingivitis, and were not correlated in periodontitis. of the inflammatory mediators/acute phase proteins, only il-1ss levels were positively associated (p < 0.001) with the pack years and cotinine levels. as might be predicted, patients with periodontitis smoked more (p < 0.001) and had higher levels of cotinine. il-1ss and antibody to a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and t. denticola were significantly higher in the patients with periodontitis than either patients with gingivitis or who were healthy. conclusions: generally, antibody to the pathogens and commensals was lower with decreased cotinine levels. smoking exacerbated differences in both inflammatory mediators and three antibody in periodontal disease compared to healthy subjects.

AB  == aim: to compare the clinical and microbiological outcome of the 1-h ultrasonic debridement of chronic periodontitis patients (cpp) with and without frequent sessions of oral hygiene reinforcement. methods: clinical measurements and subgingival plaque were collected from 44 cpp at baseline, 3- and 6-months. the control group received a single session of 1-h full-mouth ultrasonic debridement, while oral hygiene instructions (ohi) were reiterated over four visits. in the test group, ohi were limited in the 1-h treatment session. at 3-months, both groups received additional debridement and ohi. the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technique quantified porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola in plaque. results: at three months, smaller reductions in plaque and bleeding indices, and in p. gingivalis numbers were noted in the test group, while these differences disappeared at six months. after the 3-month  re-treatment visit, the test group presented with a greater probing pocket depth  (ppd) reduction. plaque negatively affected ppd in a similar manner after both treatment approaches. conclusions: lack of oral hygiene reinforcement in the 1-h  full-mouth debridement resulted in higher plaque and bleeding scores and numbers  of p. gingivalis at three months; professional removal of dental biofilm every three months is beneficial in subjects with compromised plaque control.

TI  == oxantel disrupts polymicrobial biofilm development of periodontal pathogens.
AB  == bacterial pathogens commonly associated with chronic periodontitis are the spirochete treponema denticola and the gram-negative, proteolytic species porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. these species rely on complex  anaerobic respiration of amino acids, and the anthelmintic drug oxantel has been  shown to inhibit fumarate reductase (frd) activity in some pathogenic bacteria and inhibit p. gingivalis homotypic biofilm formation. here, we demonstrate that  oxantel inhibited p. gingivalis frd activity with a 50% inhibitory concentration  (ic50) of 2.2 mum and planktonic growth of t. forsythia with a mic of 295 mum, but it had no effect on the growth of t. denticola. oxantel treatment caused the  downregulation of six p. gingivalis gene products and the upregulation of 22 gene products. all of these genes are part of a regulon controlled by heme availability. there was no large-scale change in the expression of genes encoding metabolic enzymes, indicating that p. gingivalis may be unable to overcome frd inhibition. oxantel disrupted the development of polymicrobial biofilms composed  of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola in a concentration-dependent manner. in these biofilms, all three species were inhibited to a similar degree,  demonstrating the synergistic nature of biofilm formation by these species and the dependence of t. denticola on the other two species. in a murine alveolar bone loss model of periodontitis oxantel addition to the drinking water of p. gingivalis-infected mice reduced bone loss to the same level as the uninfected control.

TI  == effect of nadir cd4+ t cell count on clinical measures of periodontal disease in  hiv+ adults before and during immune reconstitution on haart.
AB  == background: the contribution of hiv-infection to periodontal disease (pd) is poorly understood. we proposed that immunological markers would be associated with improved clinical measures of pd. methods: we performed a longitudinal cohort study of hiv-infected adults who had started highly active antiretroviral  therapy (haart) <2 years. pd was characterized clinically as the percent of teeth with >/= 1 site with periodontal probing depth (ppd) >/= 5.0mm, recession (rec) >0mm, clinical attachment level (cal) >/= 4.0mm, and bleeding on probing (bop) at >/= 4 sites/tooth and microbiologically as specific periodontopathogen concentration. linear mixed-effects models were used to assess the associations between immune function and pd. results: forty (40) subjects with median 2.7 months on haart and median nadir cd4+ t-cell count of 212 cells/mul completed a median 3 visits. over 24 months, cd4+ t-cell count increased by a mean 173 cells/microl (p<0.001) and hiv rna decreased by 0.5 log10 copies/ml (p<0.001); concurrently, ppd, cal and bop decreased by a mean 11.7%, 12.1%, and 14.7% respectively (all p<0.001). lower nadir cd4+ t-cell count was associated with worse baseline rec (-6.72%; p=0.04) and cal (9.06%; p<0.001). further, lower nadir cd4+ t-cell count was associated with a greater relative longitudinal improvement in ppd in subjects with higher baseline levels of porphyromonas gingivalis (p=0.027), and bop in subjects with higher baseline levels of porphyromonas gingivalis or treponema denticola (p=0.001 and p=0.006 respectively). longitudinal changes from baseline in cd4+ t-cell count and level  of hiv rna were not independently associated with longitudinal changes in any clinical markers of pd. conclusion: degree of immunosuppression was associated with baseline gingival recession. after haart initiation, measures of active pd improved most in those with lower nadir cd4+ t-cell counts and higher baseline levels of specific periodontopathogens. nadir cd4+ t-cell count differentially influences periodontal disease both before and after haart in hiv-infected adults.

TI  == microbial analysis of subgingival plaque samples compared to that of whole saliva in patients with periodontitis.
AB  == background: the detection of special bacterial species in patients with periodontitis is considered to be useful for clinical diagnosis and treatment. the collection of subgingival plaque samples is the common way for the determination of periodontopathic bacteria. however, recently, salivary analysis  has been discussed as an advantageous future diagnostic method for periodontitis  because it offers simple quantitative sampling and the possibility to assess various bacteria. the aim of this cross-sectional study is to investigate whether there is a correlation between the results of different bacterial species in saliva and subgingival plaque samples from individuals with aggressive periodontitis (agp) and chronic periodontitis (cp). methods: whole saliva and subgingival plaque samples from the deepest pocket of each quadrant were collected from 43 patients with cp and 33 patients with agp. twenty different bacterial species from both samplings were determined by the 16s ribosomal rna-based polymerase chain reaction with microarray technique. results: all bacterial species were detected in salivary and subgingival plaque samples. for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia, as well as actinomyces viscosus, campylobacter rectus/showae, prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra, eubacterium nodatum, and campylobacter gracilis, a significant positive correlation between salivary and subgingival plaque samples was detected in patients with both types  of periodontitis. there were no significant differences in bacteria in salivary and subgingival plaque samples between agp and cp. conclusion: salivary analysis  might be discussed as a potential alternative to subgingival plaque sampling for  microbiologic analysis in both agp and cp.

TI  == determination of periodontopathogens in patients with cri du chat syndrome.
AB  == objectives: cri du chat syndrome is a genetic alteration associated with some oral pathologies. however, it has not been described previously any clinical relationship between the periodontal disease and the syndrome. the purpose of this comparative study was to compare periodontopathogenic flora in a group with  cri du chat syndrome and another without the sindrome, to assess a potential microbiological predisposition to suffer a periodontitis. study design: the study compared nineteen subjects with cri du chat syndrome with a control group of nineteen patients without it. all patients were clinically evaluated by periodontal probing, valuing the pocket depth, the clinical attachmente level and bleeding on probing. there were no significant differences between both groups. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were detected by multiplex-pcr using 16s rdna (microident). results: when a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and t. denticola were compared, no statistically significant differences were found between the two groups (p>0.05). the value of t. forsythia was significantly higher for cri du chat syndrome (31.6%) than for the control group (5.3%). the odds ratio for t. forsythia was 8.3. conclusion: in the present study t. forsythia is associated with cri du chat syndrome subjects and not with healthy subjects.

TI  == inter-bacterial correlations in subgingival biofilms: a large-scale survey.
AB  == aim: although the complexity of the oral ecology and the ecological differences between health and disease are well accepted, a clear view on the dynamics in relation to disease is lacking. in this study, the prevalence and abundance of 20 key oral bacteria was assessed in health and disease and more importantly a closer look was given to the inter-bacterial relationships. materials and methods: a blinded microbiological database was analysed in this cross-sectional, retrospective study. the database was constructed based on microbiological analyses of samples from 6308 patients, with gradations of periodontitis (healthy to periodontitis). data concerning the abundance of 20 oral bacteria and probing  pocket depth were provided. results: porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, eubacterium nodatum, porphyromonas micra and porphyromonas intermedia showed a clear increase in abundance and prevalence with increasing pocket depth. correlation matrices illustrated that almost all microorganisms were in one way correlated to other species and most of these correlations were significant. several beneficial bacteria showed strong correlations with other beneficial bacteria. conclusion: knowledge on bacterial correlations can pave the way for new treatment options focusing on restoring the shifted balance.

TI  == salivary detection of periodontopathic bacteria in fanconi's anemia patients.
AB  == fanconi's anemia (fa) is characterized by bone marrow failure and can lead to infections such as periodontal disease. the aim of this study was to compare the  prevalence of four periodontopathic bacteria including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and treponema denticola in saliva samples from children with and without fa. paraffin-stimulated saliva samples were collected from 71 children and adolescents, aged 6-18 years old. the samples were divided in three groups: fa without hsct (n = 25), fa with hsct (n = 23) and non-fa (n = 24). the test bacteria were identified using a 16s rrna-based pcr analysis. p. gingivalis was the most frequent species in all groups and t. denticola the less frequent. p. gingivalis was also common species in combinations in all groups. no statistically difference was observed between the groups for single bacteria, pair or triple combination. the combination of the four species was detected in one saliva sample of the fa without hsct group and in five samples of the non-fa  group, with statistical difference between them (p < 0.05, fisher exact test). systemic alterations found in fa subjects did not affect the salivary distribution of the four bacteria analyzed.

TI  == quantitative analysis of periodontal pathogens present in the saliva of geriatric subjects.
AB  == purpose: at present, information regarding periodontal disease in geriatric patients is scarce. the purpose of this study was to quantify the periodontal pathogens present in the saliva of korean geriatric patients and assess the relationship between the bacterial levels and the periodontal condition. methods: six putative periodontal pathogens were quantified by using a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay in geriatric patient groups (>60 years) with mild chronic periodontitis (mcp), moderate chronic periodontitis (mocp), and severe chronic periodontitis (scp). the copy numbers of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia were measured. results: it was found that the bacterial copy numbers increased as the severity of the disease increased from mcp to scp, except for p. intermedia. for p. intermedia, it was found that samples in the mcp group yielded the largest amount. it was also found that the quantities of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola, the so-called "red complex" bacteria, were lower than those of f. nucleatum, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. intermedia in all of the samples. conclusions: collectively, the results of this study suggest that the levels of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, f. nucleatum, and t. denticola present in saliva are associated with the severity of periodontal disease in geriatric patients.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola synergistic polymicrobial biofilm development.
AB  == chronic periodontitis has a polymicrobial biofilm aetiology and interactions between key bacterial species are strongly implicated as contributing to disease  progression. porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia have all been implicated as playing roles in disease progression. p. gingivalis cell-surface-located protease/adhesins, the gingipains, have been suggested to be involved in its interactions with several other bacterial species. the aims of this study were to determine polymicrobial biofilm formation by p. gingivalis, t. denticola and t. forsythia, as well as the role of p. gingivalis gingipains in biofilm formation by using a gingipain null triple mutant. to determine homotypic and polymicrobial biofilm formation a flow cell system was employed and the biofilms imaged and quantified by fluorescent in situ hybridization using dna species-specific probes and confocal scanning laser microscopy imaging. of the three species, only p. gingivalis and t. denticola formed mature, homotypic biofilms, and a strong synergy was observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola in polymicrobial biofilm formation. this synergy was  demonstrated by significant increases in biovolume, average biofilm thickness and maximum biofilm thickness of both species. in addition there was a morphological  change of t. denticola in polymicrobial biofilms when compared with homotypic biofilms, suggesting reduced motility in homotypic biofilms. p. gingivalis gingipains were shown to play an essential role in synergistic polymicrobial biofilm formation with t. denticola.

TI  == effect of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy on periodontally infected tooth sockets in rats.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt) in alveolar treatment of areas with induced periodontitis. thirty male wistar rats were subjected to ligature-induced periodontal disease (pd) in the first left inferior molars, while the right side  molars did not receive ligatures. after 7 days of pd evolution, ligatures were removed from the left side, and the first left and right mandibular molars were extracted. afterwards, animals were divided into groups according to the following treatments: control (c)--no treatment; mechanical debridement (md)--mechanical debridement and irrigation with saline solution; and apdt--mechanical debridement, irrigation with toluidine blue o (tbo), and 1 min of laser irradiation (gaalas, 660 nm, 30 mw, 32 j/cm(2), 60 s). ligatures were removed and samples of the alveolar content after extraction and after each treatment were collected for microbial processing by real-time polymerase chain reaction with specific primers for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola. data were submitted to statistical analysis by multiple comparison tests (mcnemar test; p < 0.05). t. denticola was not found in the collected samples. a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were found in ligature samples. tooth socket samples without periodontitis induction presented lesser microbial charge than samples with induced periodontitis (p < 0.05). apdt significantly reduced a. actinomycetemcomitans levels on the left side (p < 0.05). it was concluded that apdt was an effective antimicrobial treatment for tooth sockets in areas affected by induced periodontitis.

TI  == molecular microbiological evaluation of subgingival biofilm sampling by paper point and curette.
AB  == the present clinical study aimed to investigate if there are differences in microbiological outcomes dependent on the subgingival biofilm collection method.  subgingival biofilm samples were collected from the four deepest pockets (>5 mm)  of 17 patients with aggressive periodontitis (agp) and 33 patients with chronic periodontitis (cp), first by paper point and thereafter by curette. samples obtained with the same method were pooled together from each patient and forwarded for molecular microbiological analysis by a commercially available assay (iai pado test 4.5) that estimates total bacterial load and levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. data analysis included frequency of detection, quantification and correlation of detection levels between the two sampling methods. p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and t. denticola were detected in >90% of the samples, and their detection levels exhibited a strong correlation between sampling methods. the detection consistency of a. actinomycetemcomitans was 56% between the two sampling methods. a. actinomycetemcomitans was more readily detected by paper point compared with curette collection with a stronger  correlation between the two methods in agp. subgingival biofilm sampling by curette or paper point does not yield differences in the detection of the three 'red complex' species. however, a. actinomycetemcomitans was more consistently detected by means of paper point collection, which can be crucial in the decision to administer antibiotics as an adjunctive periodontal treatment.

TI  == quantification of key periodontal pathogens in insulin-dependent type 2 diabetic  and non-diabetic patients with generalized chronic periodontitis.
AB  == periodontitis is a common problem in patients with diabetes mellitus (dm), however, differences in the putative periodontal pathogens in subjects with dm compared to non-dm subjects are still inconclusive. the red complex, which includes porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia, encompasses the most important pathogens in adult periodontal disease. the aim of the present study was to compare cell numbers of p. gingivalis, t. denticola, t.  forsythia and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in gingival sulcus of healthy, gingivitis and periodontitis sites of non-diabetes mellitus (ndm), controlled and poorly controlled insulin-dependent dm (cdm and pdm) patients with generalized chronic periodontitis. subgingival plaque samples were collected from 19 cdm, 19 pdm and 19 ndm patients. taqman real time-pcr was used to determine bacterial cell number. at subject level, the quantity of red complex bacteria was significantly higher in pdm than those of ndm and positively correlated with hba1c. at site level (total 342 sites), cell numbers of t. denticola and t. forsythia in healthy sites of cdm and pdm were significantly higher than those of ndm. in gingivitis sites, the numbers of p. gingivalis in cdm and pdm and t. forsythia in pdm were significantly higher than those of ndm while in periodontitis sites, higher quantity of p. gingivalis in pdm was observed. our study indicated that poor glycemic control is associated with increasing cell numbers of red complex bacteria in subgingival biofilm.

AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of non-surgical treatment of  periodontitis on the levels of periodontopathogens and clinical parameters in patients with different genetic backgrounds produced by polymorphisms in the interleukin (il8) gene. thirty patients grouped according to il8 atc/ttc or agt/ttc haplotypes were submitted to non-surgical periodontal treatment. levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were determined in 240 subgingival plaque samples by qpcr. the association between il8 haplotypes and the levels of periodontopathogens and clinical parameters was investigated by multilevel analysis accounting for the clustering of diseased sites analyzed within patients. it was observed that neither levels of periodontopathogens nor non-surgical treatment was associated with the il8 haplotype. the clinical parameters after periodontal treatment were similar in diseased and healthy sites, independently of the il8 haplotype. nonetheless, in the same period, diseased sites of agt/ttc patients harbored higher levels of p.  gingivalis, t. denticola, t. forsythia, and red complex than those of atc/ttc patients. however, the non-surgical periodontal therapy decreased the levels of these periodontopathogens and of the tested clinical parameters of diseased sites in both groups. non-surgical therapy is equally effective in improving clinical parameters and decreasing the levels of periodontopathogens, independent of the genotype groups produced by the il8 haplotype.

TI  == periodontopathogens levels and clinical response to periodontal therapy in individuals with the interleukin-4 haplotype associated with susceptibility to chronic periodontitis.
AB  == periodontitis is an inflammatory disease that results from an interaction between dental biofilm agents and the host immune-inflammatory response. periodontopathogenic organisms, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola, as well as the host's susceptibility, represented by the host's genetic makeup, are the key factors that influence this complex disease. recently, we identified haplotypes in the il4 gene that were associated with chronic periodontitis (cp). this study aimed to evaluate whether  subjects with different il4 haplotypes (tci/cci and ttd/cti) would be differentially colonized by periodontopathogens and whether they would respond differently to non-surgical periodontal therapy. thirty-nine patients carrying the il4 haplotype of genetic susceptibility to cp (il4+) or protection against cp (il4-) were evaluated. those groups were further subdivided into individuals with cp (cp il4+ or cp il4-) and those that were periodontally healthy (h) (h il4+ or  h il4-). cp patients were submitted to non-surgical periodontal therapy. clinical and microbiological analyses were performed considering the data at baseline and  45 and 90 days after periodontal therapy. periodontopathogens levels were evaluated by absolute quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr). the baseline data revealed that the total levels of periodontopathogens were higher in the cp  il4+ than in the cp il4- groups. clinical analyses revealed that the periodontal  therapy was equally effective, independent of the subject's il4 genetic load. the tci/cci il4 haplotype, previously associated with genetic susceptibility to cp, was also associated with increased levels of periodontopathogenic bacteria, but this genetic background did not influence the response to non-surgical periodontal treatment.

TI  == clinical, microbiologic, and host response characteristics in patients with peri-implant mucositis.
AB  == purpose: to analyze the clinical, microbiologic, and host response characteristics (interleukins 1beta and 6) in the peri-implant sulcus fluid (pisf) of patients with healthy dental implants and with peri-implant mucositis.  materials and methods: clinical parameters (modified gingival index [mgi], modified plaque index [mpi], probing pocket depth [ppd], and absence or presence  of radiologic bone loss) were recorded, and pisf samples were obtained from peri-implant sites showing mucositis as well as healthy sites. the periodontopathogenic bacteria tannerella forsythia (tf), treponema denticola (td), and porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) were evaluated, together with the total bacterial load (tbl) and the interleukin (il) 1beta and il-6 values. results: the study population consisted of 34 individuals, and 77 dental implants were evaluated during the study (23 mucositis and 54 healthy peri-implant sites). the  mgi, mpi, and ppd scores of the peri-implant mucositis group were significantly greater than in the healthy group. no differences in detection frequency were found for putative periodontal pathogens and tbl between the healthy peri-implant sites and mucositis sites. the mucositis group showed a significantly greater expression of il-6 than the healthy group (p < .05). although il-1beta was increased in the mucositis group, there was no statistically significant difference versus the healthy implant group. conclusions: an analysis was made of the clinical, microbiologic, and host response characteristics in implants with peri-implant mucositis, establishing comparisons with healthy implants. in the patients studied, bacterial plaque induced an inflammatory response that can lead to the development of peri-implant mucositis. adequate plaque control is therefore able to increase peri-implant health, avoiding the risk of future complications. no specific association to the studied bacterial species was established.

TI  == clinical evaluation of salivary periodontal pathogen levels by real-time polymerase chain reaction in patients before dental implant treatment.
AB  == objective: periodontal pathogens in dental plaque are the main causative agents of periodontitis and peri-implantitis. detection of the presence of such periodontal pathogens early would serve as a useful tool in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether the periodontal pathogen levels in saliva were correlated with the periodontal status of patients receiving implant treatment. materials and methods: a total of 291 patients visiting tokyo dental college chiba hospital were divided into four groups: a no-periodontitis (np) group, a mild-periodontitis (mip) group, a moderate-periodontitis (mop) group, and a severe-periodontitis (sp) group. the levels of the following five periodontal pathogens in saliva were evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction: porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia. results: the levels of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were significantly higher in mop group than in np  group (p < 0.05). the levels of all periodontal pathogens tested except a. actinomycetemcomitans were significantly higher in sp group than in np group (p < 0.05). conclusion: the detection levels of the periodontal pathogens targeted in  saliva samples were correlated with the periodontal status. this suggests that using saliva to screen for periodontopathic bacteria offers an easier-to-use clinical tool than the paper point method in the diagnosis and treatment of periodontitis and peri-implantitis.

TI  == [analysis of antimicrobial effect of mtad solution in infected root canal system  using pcr technique].
AB  == introduction: clinically acceptable antiseptic should possess organolithic-mineralolithic properties and antimicrobial efficacy, and should be  non-toxic. objective: the aim of the paper was to assess the presence of genomes  of the most common microorganisms (porphyromonas gingivalis, agregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tanerella forsythensis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and enterococcus faecalis) in infected tooth root canals before and after rinsing with solution of doxycycline, citric acid and detergent tween-80 (mtad) in patients with clinically diagnosed primary apex periodontitis. methods: the content of primarily infected canals before and after using the mtad solution was used as a biological material in which the presence of microorganisms dna was proved. for the detection of bacterial genome the multiplex pcr technique was applied. results: the percentage of positive samples before canal treatment was 100%. in infected root canals e. faecalis was most dominant (37%). in a relatively high percentage we detected p. intermedia (25%), a. actinomycetemcomitans (20%), t. denticola (17%), t. forsythensis (15%) and p. gingivalis (10%). after rinsing the canal system using mtad solution, there was a statistically significant decrease in e. faecalis (12%), p. intermedia (0%), t forsythensis (0%) and p. gingivalis (0%). the presence of other bacteria was also diminished but not statistically significantly. conclusion: with the application  of multiplex pcr technique which provided a simultaneous amplification of various genomic sequences, using several pairs of primers, the most dominant in infected  root canals were e. faecalis. p. intermedia, a. actinomycetemcomitans, t. denticola, t. forsythensis and p. gingivalis. after mechanic treatment and irrigation of root canals with mtad solution, p. intermedia, p. gingivalis and t  forsythensis were not found. the presence of e. faecalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. denticola was diminished, however, not statistically significantly.

TI  == periodontopathogen profile of healthy and oral lichen planus patients with gingivitis or periodontitis.
AB  == oral lichen planus (olp) is a chronic inflammatory disease that is frequently detected in oral tissues. the aim of our study was to identify the prevalence of  the detection of periodontopathogenic microorganisms (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola in olp patients and to compare with  this prevalence of periodontopathogenic microorganisms in healthy non-olp patients. our study included 27 (18 chronic periodontitis (olpp) and 9 gingivitis (olpg)) patients diagnosed with olp along with 26 (13 chronic periodontitis (hp)  and 13 gingivitis (hg)) healthy non-olp patients. the multiplex polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) with subsequent reverse hybridization method (micro-ident) was used for identifying periodontopathogenic microorganisms present in subgingival plaque samples. the percentages of detection for a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia and t. denticola in subgingival plaque samples taken from olp patients (olpg and olpp) were 18.5%, 85.1%, 81.4%, 88.8% and 74%, respectively. meanwhile, in the non-olp patients (hg and hp), these values were 7.6%, 50%, 46.1%, 73% and 57.7%, respectively. thus, comparing the non-olp groups with the olp groups, the periodontopathogens' percentages of detection in the olp groups were higher than those in the non-olp groups. according to our study results, olp patients have higher levels of infection with a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia and t. denticola than non-olp patients. we argue that the high percentages in patients with olp may help identify the importance of periodontopathogenic microorganisms  in the progress of periodontal diseases of olp.

TI  == differential expression of mitogen activating protein kinases in periodontitis.
AB  == aim: following toll-like receptor (tlr) engagement, lipopolysaccharide (lps) can  stimulate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines thus activating the innate immune response. the production of inflammatory cytokines results, in part, from  the activation of kinase-induced signalling cascades and transcriptional factors. of the four distinct classes of mitogen-activated protein kinases (mapk) described in mammals, p38, c-jun n-terminal activated kinases (jnk1-3) and extracellular activated kinases (erk1,2) are the best studied. previous data have established that p38 mapk signalling is required for inflammation and bone loss in periodontal disease pre-clinical animal models. materials & methods: in this study, we obtained healthy and diseased periodontal tissues along with clinical parameters and microbiological parameters. excised fixed tissues were immunostained with total and phospho-specific antibodies against p38, jnk and erk kinases. results: intensity scoring from immunostained tissues was correlated with clinical periodontal parameters. rank correlations with clinical indices were statistically significantly positive (p-value < 0.05) for total p38 (correlations ranging 0.49-0.68), phospho-p38 (range 0.44-0.56), and total erk (range 0.52-0.59) levels, and correlations with jnk levels also supported association (range 0.42-0.59). phospho-jnk and phospho-erk showed no significant  positive correlation with clinical parameters of disease. conclusion: these data  strongly implicate p38 mapk as a major mapk involved in human periodontal inflammation and severity.

TI  == isolation of treponema and tannerella spp. from equine odontoclastic tooth resorption and hypercementosis related periodontal disease.
AB  == reasons for performing study: red complex bacteria, i.e. porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia, are involved in the onset and progression of periodontal disease in man, yet seldom inhabit the oral  cavity of healthy individuals. periodontal disease is also encountered in horses, with equine odontoclastic tooth resorption and hypercementosis (eotrh) constituting a particular form of disease. however, only little is known about the oral microbiome of healthy and periodontitis-affected equids. objective: we aimed to test the hypothesis that red complex bacteria are also associated with eotrh-related periodontal disease. study design: controlled cross-sectional study. methods: we screened dna purified from crevicular fluid derived from 23 eotrh-affected and 21 disease-free horses for the presence of treponema spp., tannerella spp. and porphyromonas gingivalis dna by polymerase chain reaction. subsequently, amplified dna was bidirectionally sequenced and identified via blast analysis. results: treponema and/or tannerella dna was detected in 100% of  periodontitis-related samples and in 52.2% of dna derived from healthy horses. twenty-six amplicon sequences were 98-100% homologous to published bacterial sequences, which mostly corresponded to treponema pectinovorum, oral treponema clones ju025 and omz 840, and tannerella forsythia. p. gingivalis dna was only found in 3 eotrh-related samples. forty-three amplicon sequences revealed weaker  homologies ranging between 80% and 97% to known treponema or tannerella strains,  partly because of their heterogeneity, partly because they obviously represented  so far unknown types. conclusions: this is the first report in which known and novel treponema and tannerella spp. were isolated in association with eotrh-related periodontal disease.

TI  == serum antibody responses to periodontal microbiota in chronic and aggressive periodontitis: a postulate revisited.
AB  == background: the authors revisited the 1999 international workshop postulate of robust serum antibody responses to infecting agents in localized aggressive periodontitis (lagp) and weak responses in generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp). antibody responses were further examined in localized and generalized chronic periodontitis (lcp and gcp). methods: the study includes 119 patients (60 males and 59 females, aged 11 to 76 years), 18 with lagp, 37 with gagp, 37 with lcp, and 27 with gcp. multiple subgingival plaque samples/patient (1,057 in total) were analyzed with respect to 11 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridizations, and serum immunoglobulin (ig)g levels were measured against the same bacteria using checkerboard immunoblotting. further, infection ratios (antibody level over the average bacterial colonization by the homologous  species) were computed for each patient. comparisons of bacterial colonization, serum igg levels, and infection ratios were made across the diagnostic categories using multivariable linear regression models adjusting for age and race/ethnicity. results: there were no statistically significant differences in serum igg levels to aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans among the four diagnostic categories. igg levels to several species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and campylobacter rectus, were highest in patients with gagp and significantly different from lcp and gcp, but not from lagp. comparisons based on infection ratios showed no statistically significant differences for any species between gagp and lagp. conclusion: this study provides evidence against the 1999 workshop's postulate of weak serum antibody responses in patients with gagp and shows that serum igg responses in gagp are comparable to those in lagp, but higher than in gcp or lcp for several species.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and toll-like receptor 2 are associated with hypertensive disorders in placental tissue: a case-control study.
AB  == aim(s): to explore the associations between the presence of periodontal pathogens and the expression of toll-like receptors (tlr-2 and tlr-4) in the placental tissue of patients with hypertensive disorders compared to the placentas of healthy normotensive patients. material and methods: a case-control study was performed. from a cohort composed of 126 pregnant women, 33 normotensive healthy  pregnant women were randomly selected, and 25 cases of patients with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia, were selected. placental biopsy was obtained after aseptic placental collection at the time of delivery. all of the samples were processed and analysed for the detection of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technique. determination of the expressions of tlr-2 and tlr-4 was performed in samples of total purified protein isolated from  placental tissues and analysed by elisa. the data were assessed using descriptive statistics. the associations among variables were estimated through multiple logistic regression models and the mann-whitney test to evaluate the differences  between the two groups. results: a significant increase was observed in the expression of tlr-2 in the placentas of patients with hypertensive disorders (p = 0.04). additionally, the multiple logistic regression models demonstrated an association between the presence of t. denticola and p. gingivalis in placental tissues and hypertensive disorders (or: 9.39, p = 0.001, ci 95% 2.39-36.88 and or: 7.59, p = 0.019, ci 95% 1.39-41.51, respectively). conclusions: in the present study, pregnant women with periodontal disease presented an association in the placental tissue between the presence of t. denticola and p. gingivalis and hypertensive disorders. additionally, increased expression of tlr-2 was observed. however, further studies are required to determine the specific roles of periodontal pathogens and tlrs in the placental tissue of patients with pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders.

TI  == periodontopathogen and epstein-barr virus-associated periapical periodontitis may be the source of retrograde infectious peri-implantitis.
AB  == background: herpesviral-bacterial synergism may play a role in periodontitis and  peri-implantitis etiopathogenesis. periapical periodontitis (pp) lesions can predict future apical peri-implantitis complications. purpose: this pilot study aimed to substantiate herpesviral-bacterial coinfection in symptomatic (sp) and asymptomatic (ap) pp and assess associations with periodontopathogen salivary contamination in patients receiving implants. materials and methods: polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based identification was performed on pp granulation tissue  (gt) from 33 sp and ap patients and compared with unstimulated whole saliva. quantitative pcr evaluated epstein-barr virus (ebv) and cytomegalovirus copy counts. results: sp gt had higher proportions of periodontopathogens. symptomatic patients were 3.7 times more likely to be infected with ebv than ap (p = .07; 95% ci: 0.8-16.2). sp were 2.9, 2.1, 3.6, and 1.6 times more likely to be infected with treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and porphyromonas gingivalis, respectively. the odds ratio of ebv infecting pp lesions was two times higher in those positive for the virus  in saliva. saliva tannerella forsythia-positive patients were 15 times more likely to present this pathogen in pp lesions (p = .038). saliva ebv-positive individuals were 7 and 3.5 times more likely to yield gt contamination with t. forsythia and t. denticola, respectively. ebv copy counts were significantly higher in sp (p < .01). conclusions: a causal association between ebv, specific bacterial anaerobic infection, and symptomatic pp is likely. ebv high prevalence  underscores the viral etiological importance. salivary ebv contamination is likely to be associated with viral and bacterial gt infection. saliva pcr analysis can be a good predictor of gt specific infection and help establish antimicrobial therapy. if confirmed by prospective longitudinal clinical trials,  antiviral therapy could possibly benefit sp and nonresponsive to treatment individuals and help prevent potential peri-implant infectious complications.

TI  == determining the presence of periodontopathic virulence factors in short-term postmortem alzheimer's disease brain tissue.
AB  == the aim of this study was to establish a link between periodontal disease and alzheimer's disease (ad) with a view to identifying the major periodontal disease bacteria (treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and porphyromonas gingivalis) and/or bacterial components in brain tissue from 12 h postmortem delay. our request matched 10 ad cases for tissue from brains for dementia research alongside 10 non-ad age-related controls with similar or greater postmortem interval. we exposed svgp12, an astrocyte cell line, to culture supernatant containing lipopolysaccharide (lps) from the putative periodontal bacteria p. gingivalis. the challenged svgp12 cells and cryosections from ad and  control brains were immunolabeled and immunoblotted using a battery of antibodies including the anti-p. gingivalis-specific monoclonal antibody. immunofluorescence labeling demonstrated the svgp12 cell line was able to adsorb lps from culture supernatant on its surface membrane; similar labeling was observed in four out of 10 ad cases. immunoblotting demonstrated bands corresponding to lps from p. gingivalis in the svgp12 cell lysate and in the same four ad brain specimens which were positive when screened by immunofluorescence. all controls remained negative throughout while the same four cases were consistently positive for p. gingivalis lps (p = 0.029). this study confirms that lps from periodontal bacteria can access the ad brain during life as labeling in the corresponding controls, with equivalent/longer postmortem interval, was absent. demonstration of a known chronic oral-pathogen-related virulence factor reaching the human brains suggests an inflammatory role in the existing ad pathology.

TI  == association between il8 haplotypes and pathogen levels in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == chronic periodontitis (cp) is considered to be a multifactorial disease influenced by microbial and genetic factors. the aim of the present study was to  investigate whether the genetic susceptibility to cp in individuals with the il8  atc/ttc haplotype is associated with subgingival levels of periodontopathogens. sixty-five individuals, grouped according to the presence (n = 28) or absence (n  = 37) of the il8 haplotype, were evaluated. after clinical periodontal evaluation, each group was subdivided according to the presence (cp) or absence (h) of periodontitis. four subgingival samples were obtained from cp and two samples per subject from h patients. the levels and proportions of porphyromonas  gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (q-pcr). no differences were found in the proportion of periodontopathogenic bacteria between groups with the  presence or absence of the il8 haplotype. however, in the cp groups, the levels of periodontopathogens were significantly higher in the individuals without the il8 haplotype than in the individuals with the il8 haplotype. these results suggest that periodontal destruction may occur in patients who are considered to  be genetically susceptible to cp with a lower microbial challenge because of the  presence of the il8 atc/ttc haplotype than in patients without this haplotype.

TI  == evaluation of periodontal pathogens in amniotic fluid and the role of periodontal disease in pre-term birth and low birth weight.
AB  == background: pre-term birth and/or low birth weight (ptlbw) is a serious problem in developing countries. the absence of known risk factors in approximately 50% of ptlbw cases has resulted in a continued search for other causes. the aim of this study was to examine the effect of periodontitis on pregnancy outcomes. methods: samples were taken from 50 pregnant women who underwent amniocentesis. polymerase chain reaction was performed on amniotic fluid samples obtained during amniocentesis and on subgingival plaque samples to determine the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia,  campylobacter rectus and eikenella corrodens. plaque index, gingival index, bleeding on probing, probing depth and clinical attachment level were evaluated.  medical records were obtained after birth. results: social and demographic variables were similar among the gingivitis (g), localized periodontitis (lp) and generalized periodontitis (gp) groups. four subjects gave birth to ptlbw neonates. campylobacter rectus, t. forsythia, p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum were detected in the amniotic fluid and subgingival plaque samples of three patients who gave birth to ptlbw neonates. the amniotic fluid sample from the fourth patient was not positive for any of the tested pathogens. conclusion: these findings suggest that the transmission of some periodontal pathogens from the oral cavity of the mother may cause adverse pregnancy outcomes. the results contribute to an understanding of the association between periodontal disease and ptlbw, but further studies are required to better clarify the possible relationship.

AB  == objective: to investigate the effects of periodontal bacterial lysates on maturation and function of mature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (m-mddcs) derived from individuals with chronic periodontitis (cp) or healthy periodontal tissue (hp). design: m-mddcs derived from peripheral blood monocytes, cultured for 7 days in presence of interleukin (il)-4 and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (gm-csf), were stimulated with lysates of streptococcus sanguinis, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, or treponema denticola on day 4, and were then phenotyped. il-10, il-12 and ifn-gamma concentration in the supernatant of cultures were measured. results: expression of hla-dr was lower in bacterial-unstimulated mature m-mddc from cp compared to hp (p=0.04), while expression of cd1a and cd123 were higher in cp. the expression pattern of hla-dr, cd11c, cd123, and cd1a did not change on bacterial stimulation, regardless of the bacteria. stimulation with p. intermedia upregulated cd80 and cd86 in cp cells (p</=0.05). production of il-12p70 by bacterial-unstimulated m-mddcs was 5.8-fold greater in cp compared to hp. bacterial stimulation further increased il-12p70 production while decreasing il-10. significantly more ifn-gamma was produced in co-cultures of cp m-mddcs than with hp m-mddcs when cells were stimulated with p. intermedia (p=0.009). conclusions: bacterial-unstimulated m-mddc from cp exhibited a more immature phenotype but a cytokine profile biased towards proinflammatory response; this pattern was maintained/exacerbated after bacterial stimulation. p. intermedia upregulated co-stimulatory molecules and ifn-gamma expression in cp m-mddc. these events might contribute to periodontitis pathogenesis.

TI  == an investigation of the presence of specific anaerobic species in necrotic primary teeth.
AB  == different microbial identification methods have shown that the microbial community profiles in endodontic infections are diverse and assorted. the aim of  this study was to evaluate the frequency of selected endodontic pathogens in the  pulp chambers (pcs) and root canals (rcs) of infected primary teeth using pcr methods. paired pc and rc samples were collected from 15 subjects and analyzed by pcr for the presence of filifactor alocis, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella tannerae, tanerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and treponema socranskii. the frequency of each species was  determined in the pc and rc of each case. the species most frequently detected in pcs were p. nigrescens (86.7%), p. gingivalis (73.3%), and f. alocis (73.3%). of  the pc samples, 13.3% contained p. micra and t. denticola, and 6.7% contained t.  forsythia. the species most frequently detected in rcs were p. gingivalis (100%)  and p. nigrescens (93.3%). p. tannerae, p. micra, and t. denticola were found in  40% of the rc samples; t. forsythia was found in 26.7% of the rc samples. the "red complex", which comprises p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia, was not found in the pc of any tooth but was found in 30% of the rc samples. the detection of p. nigrescens in the pc was statistically associated with the presence of p. nigrescens in the rc (p = 0.04). the results suggest high heterogeneity among the samples, even among those from the same subject.

TI  == detection of oral bacterial dna in synovial fluid.
AB  == objectives: as periodontal bacteria might be involved in the aetiology of rheumatic diseases, we analysed synovial fluid obtained from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and controls for the presence of dna of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. methods: in all, 42 patients suffering from ra (mean age 53.8 +/- 16.7 years, 40.4% females) and 114 controls  with no rheumatic diseases (mean age 56.1 +/- 15.2 years, 52.4% females) were included. dna from synovial fluid was isolated by qiaamp kit (qiagen, hilden, germany). polymerase chain reactions (pcrs) specific for the 16s rrna genes of the above specified bacteria were developed. subgingival bacterial colonization was analysed using micro-ident((r)) test (hain-diagnostik, nehren, germany). results: in patients with ra dna of p. gingivalis was detected in synovial fluid  more often than in controls (15.7% versus 3.5%, p = 0.045). more patients than controls harboured dna from p. gingivalis in both, oral plaque and synovial fluid (11.9% versus. 0.9%, p = 0.030). among the patients group the number of missing teeth was correlated with the number of joints with movement restrictions caused  by ra. conclusions: dna of periodontopathogens can be found in synovial fluid and oral bacteria may play a role in the pathogenesis of arthritis.

TI  == cluster of bacteria associated with peri-implantitis.
AB  == background: information on the microbiota in peri-implantitis is limited. we hypothesized that neither gender nor a history of periodontitis/smoking or the microbiota at implants differ by implant status. materials and methods: baseline  microbiological samples collected at one implant in each of 166 participants with peri-implantitis and from 47 individuals with a healthy implant were collected and analyzed by dna-dna checkerboard hybridization (78 species). clinical and radiographic data defined implant status. results: nineteen bacterial species were found at higher counts from implants with peri-implantitis including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, helicobacter pylori, haemophilus influenzae, porphyromonas gingivalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus anaerobius, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and treponema socranskii (p < .001). receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified t. forsythia, p. gingivalis, t. socranskii, staph. aureus, staph. anaerobius, strep. intermedius, and strep. mitis in peri-implantitis comprising 30% of the total microbiota. when adjusted for gender (not significant [ns]), smoking status (ns), older age (p = .003), periodontitis  history (p < .01), and t. forsythia (likelihood ratio 3.6, 95% confidence interval 1.4, 9.1, p = .007) were associated with peri-implantitis. conclusion: a cluster of bacteria including t. forsythia and staph. aureus are associated with  peri-implantitis.

TI  == subgingival aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans associates with the risk of coronary artery disease.
AB  == aim: we investigated the association between angiographically verified coronary artery disease (cad) and subgingival aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola. materials and methods: the cross-sectional study population (n = 445) comprised 171 (38.4%) patients with stable cad, 158 (35.5%) with acute coronary syndrome (acs) and 116  (26.1%) with no significant cad (no cad). all patients participated in clinical and radiological oral health examinations. pooled subgingival bacterial samples were analysed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assays. results: in all study groups, the presence of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and t. denticola indicated a  significant (p </= 0.001) linear association with the extent of alveolar bone loss (abl), but a. actinomycetemcomitans did not (p = 0.074). with a threshold level of bacterial cells 1 x 10(5) a. actinomycetemcomitans was significantly more prevalent in the stable cad group (42.1%) compared to the no cad group (30.2%) (p = 0.040). in a multi-adjusted logistic regression analysis using this  threshold, a. actinomycetemcomitans positivity associated with stable cad (or 1.83, 95% ci 1.00-3.35, p = 0.049), but its level or levels of other bacteria did not. conclusions: the presence of subgingival a. actinomycetemcomitans associates with an almost twofold risk of stable cad independently of alveolar bone loss.

TI  == subgingival bacterial burden in relation to clinical and radiographic periodontal parameters.
AB  == background: this cross-sectional study characterizes the association between subgingival bacterial profile and periodontal parameters in patients assigned to  coronary angiography because of cardiologic problems, which may affect the oral microbiota. methods: pooled subgingival bacterial samples were collected from 477 dentate individuals during the oral examinations, along with periodontal probing  depth (pd) and assessments of bleeding on probing (bop) and radiographic alveolar bone loss (abl). the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assay was used to determine the levels of 29 oral bacteria, which were divided into three bacterial complexes. results: all bacterial combinations from the etiologic bacterial group and each species from the red complex were significantly associated (p <0.001) with grade of abl. the prevalence of the etiologic bacterial group and the level  of each species were also associated strongly with the proportion of sites with pd 4 to 5 mm and >/= 6 mm, bop, and abl, except aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. levels of gram-negative oral bacteria correlated significantly with those of gram-positive species (r = 0.840, p <0.001). in multiple logistic regression analysis, the prevalence of the etiologic bacterial  group, levels of gram-negative bacteria and treponema denticola, and the prevalence of porphyromonas gingivalis and t. denticola associated significantly  with abl, whereas other bacterial complexes and levels of gram-positive species did not. conclusions: although levels of gram-negative and -positive species paralleled periodontal parameters, only the species considered etiologic were associated with abl.

TI  == polymicrobial infection with major periodontal pathogens induced periodontal disease and aortic atherosclerosis in hyperlipidemic apoe(null) mice.
AB  == periodontal disease (pd) and atherosclerosis are both polymicrobial and multifactorial and although observational studies supported the association, the  causative relationship between these two diseases is not yet established. polymicrobial infection-induced periodontal disease is postulated to accelerate atherosclerotic plaque growth by enhancing atherosclerotic risk factors of orally infected apolipoprotein e deficient (apoe(null)) mice. at 16 weeks of infection,  samples of blood, mandible, maxilla, aorta, heart, spleen, and liver were collected, analyzed for bacterial genomic dna, immune response, inflammation, alveolar bone loss, serum inflammatory marker, atherosclerosis risk factors, and  aortic atherosclerosis. pcr analysis of polymicrobial-infected (porphyromonas gingivalis [p. gingivalis], treponema denticola [t. denticola], and tannerella forsythia [t. forsythia]) mice resulted in detection of bacterial genomic dna in  oral plaque samples indicating colonization of the oral cavity by all three species. fluorescent in situ hybridization detected p. gingivalis and t. denticola within gingival tissues of infected mice and morphometric analysis showed an increase in palatal alveolar bone loss (p<0.0001) and intrabony defects suggesting development of periodontal disease in this model. polymicrobial-infected mice also showed an increase in aortic plaque area (p<0.05) with macrophage accumulation, enhanced serum amyloid a, and increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides. a systemic infection was indicated by the detection of bacterial genomic dna in the aorta and liver of infected mice and elevated levels of bacterial specific igg antibodies (p<0.0001). this study was a unique effort to understand the effects of a polymicrobial infection with p. gingivalis, t. denticola and t. forsythia on periodontal disease and associated atherosclerosis in apoe(null) mice.

TI  == clinical outcome of a nonsurgical and surgical treatment protocol in different types of peri-implantitis: a case series.
AB  == objective: the replacement of missing teeth with dental implants has been standard practice in dentistry for many years. the success of dental implants depends on many factors, among which the diagnosis, clinical severity, and treatment of peri-implant diseases play a key role. in this prospective case series, the influence of cumulative treatment modalities on peri-implantitis with and without pus formation on clinical outcome was assessed. method and materials: during 2010, 28 patients were referred for peri-implantitis treatment. they presented two different types of peri-implant diseases: peri-implantitis with (17 implants) or without pus formation (33 implants). after microbiologic diagnosis,  all patients were treated at baseline with full-mouth scaling and root planing. two months later, further full-mouth scaling and root planing and additional antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt) was applied. four months after baseline, patients with pus formation additionally underwent access flap surgery. active human matrix metalloproteinase-8 (ammp-8) levels were measured in eluates  before and after all treatment modalities and 7 months after baseline. results: clinical parameters (probing depth, bleeding on probing) and ammp-8-levels improved in both groups after treatment and the final examination. in periimplantitis patients without pus formation, all parameters decreased after full-mouth scaling and root planing and the additional apdt and no surgery was necessary to improve the parameters. in patients with pus formation, the parameters decreased only after access flap surgery. conclusion: the presence of  pus influences the clinical outcome of the treatment of peri-implant diseases. whereas peri-implantitis cases without pus formation can be successfully managed  nonsurgically, peri-implantitis with pus formation can be effectively treated after an additional observation time of 3 months postoperatively only with additional flap surgery.

TI  == assessment of viable periodontal pathogens by reverse transcription quantitative  polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == background and objective: molecular biological methods for the detection of periodontitis-associated bacteria based on dna amplification have many advantages over classical culture techniques. however, when it comes to assessing immediate  therapeutic success, e.g. reduction of viable bacteria, dna-based polymerase chain reaction is unsuitable because it does not distinguish between live and dead bacteria. our objective was to establish a simple rna-based method that is easily set up and allows reliable assessment of the live bacterial load. material and methods: we compared conventional quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr), propidium monoazide-qpcr and reverse transcription qpcr (rt-qpcr) for the detection of periodontal pathogens after antibiotic treatment in vitro. applicability was tested using clinical samples of subgingival plaque obtained from patients at different treatment stages. results: the bacterial load was remarkably stable over prolonged periods when assessed by conventional qpcr, while both propidium monoazide intercalation as well as cdna quantitation showed  a decline according to decreasing numbers of viable bacteria after antibiotic treatment. clinical samples of subgingival plaque were directly subjected to dnase i treatment and rt without previous extraction or purification steps. while the results of the dna- and rna-based methods are comparable in untreated patients, the classical qpcr frequently detected substantial bacterial load in treated patients where rt-qpcr no longer indicates the presence of those pathogens. the disagreement rates ranged between 4 and 20% in first visit patients and 8-50% in the group of currently treated patients. conclusion: we propose to use rna-based detection methods to verify the successful eradication of periodontal pathogens.

TI  == [relationship between volatile fatty acids and porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola in gingival crevicular fluids of patients with aggressive periodontitis].
AB  == objective: short chain fatty acids (scfas), such as succinic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, etc. are metabolic product of putative periodontal  pathogens, which play significant roles in periodontitis. the aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis), treponema denticola (t. denticola), and the concentration of scfas in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) of patients with aggressive periodontitis (agp). methods:  gcf was sampled from 4 sites per individual in 20 patients with agp and 14 healthy controls. concentrations of scfas, including succinic acid, acetic acid,  propionic acid, butyric acid, and isovaleric acid in the supernant of gcf were analyzed by high performance capillary electrophoresis (hpce), p. gingivalis and  t. denticola in the deposit of the same gcf were detected by pcr with their electrophoretic band quantified. results: the concentrations of succinic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, and isovaleric acid, the prevalence and pcr band quantity of p. gingivalis and t. denticola in gcf were all significantly higher in patients with agp than that of healthy controls. in patients with agp, butyric acid concentration was significantly higher in p. gingivalis positive sites than negative sites [2.87 (0.99, 4.36) mmol/l vs. 0.33  (0.00, 1.44) mmol/l, p<0.05], the concentrations of succinic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, and isovaleric acid were positively correlated with pcr band quantity of p. gingivalis (r value was 0.334, 0.548, 0.411, 0.493, 0.273, respectively, p<0.05); the concentrations of scfas were significantly higher in t. denticola positive sites than negative sites: succinic acid, 1.67 (1.15, 2.11) mmol/l vs. 0.80 (0.48, 1.06) mmol/l; acetic acid, 31.95 (23.77, 43.13) mmol/l vs.12.51 (7.57, 15.69) mmol/l; propionic acid, 11.86 (6.55, 14.98)  mmol/l vs. 2.82 (1.71, 7.03) mmol/l; butyric acid, 3.45 (2.41, 4.78) mmol/l vs. 0.54 (0.00, 1.56) mmol/l; isovaleric acid, 2.23 (1.05, 3.85) mmol/l vs. 0.62 (0.00, 2.33) mmol/l. the concentrations of succinic acid, acetic acid, propionic  acid, butyric acid were positively correlated with pcr band quantity of t. denticola (r value was 0.443, 0.702, 0.625, 0.557, respectively, p<0.05). conclusion: scfas concentrations reflect the quantity of p. gingivalis and t. denticola in patients with agp, and may be an indicator to the disease progression in patients with agp.

TI  == the anti-phospholipid antibody-dependent and independent effects of periodontopathic bacteria on threatened preterm labor and preterm birth.
AB  == purpose: periodontal disease is considered to be a risk factor for threatened preterm labor (tpl) and preterm birth (pb), but pathogenic mechanisms have not yet been elucidated. we hypothesized that infection with periodontopathic bacteria may enhance thrombosis through molecular mimicry with tlrvyk peptides on beta-2 glycoprotein i, a target molecule in anti-phospholipid syndrome. this study aimed to examine the effects of periodontitis on tpl and pb. methods: ninety-five pregnant women (47 tpl and 48 healthy subjects) participated. periodontal clinical parameters and periodontopathic bacteria were examined. molecular mimicry between tlrvyk peptides and homologous peptides on the periodontopathic bacteria was examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) using rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for the respective peptides (sirvyk on aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tlriyt on porphyromonus gingivalis, and tlalyk on treponema denticola). serum high-sensitivity c-reactive protein, anti-tlrvyk and anti-sirvyk igg antibodies were measured using elisa. results: among the rabbit antibodies specific for the bacterial homologous peptides, only anti-sirvyk igg antibody reacted with tlrvyk peptides. multivariable analysis showed that anti-sirvyk igg antibody was significantly associated with diagnosis of tpl. of 95 births, 14 (14.7 %) delivered preterm. the preterm birth rate was higher in the anti-sirvyk igg antibody >median group than in the </=median group. of the 47 tpl subjects 13 had pb, and ordinal logistic regression analysis revealed that past smoking, presence of p. gingivalis and anti-sirvyk igg antibody were significantly correlated with pb. conclusions: infection with p. gingivalis and the antibody response to sirvyk might be associated with tpl and pb.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis outer membrane vesicles mediate coaggregation and piggybacking of treponema denticola and lachnoanaerobaculum saburreum.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis sheds outer membrane vesicles that contain several virulence factors, including adhesins. in this study, we investigated the ability of p. gingivalis outer membrane vesicles to mediate the coaggregation and piggybacking of treponema denticola and lachnoanaerobaculum saburreum. marked coaggregation between t. denticola and l. saburreum occurred in the presence of p. gingivalis outer membrane vesicles. sucrose was an effective chemoattractant for the motile species t. denticola. the addition of outer membrane vesicles to a mixture of t. denticola and l. saburreum significantly increased the number of nonmotile bacteria that migrated into a sucrose-filled capillary tube immersed in the bacterial mixture. under optimal conditions, the number of nonmotile l. saburreum in the capillary tube increased approximately 5-fold, whereas no increase occurred when boiled vesicles were used. this study showed that p. gingivalis outer membrane vesicles mediate coaggregation between t. denticola and l. saburreum and that nonmotile bacteria can be translocated by piggybacking on spirochetes.

TI  == clinical and microbiologic effects of lingual cervical coverage by removable partial dentures.
AB  == purpose: the effect of gingival coverage by removable partial dentures (rpds) on  bacterial accumulation has not been sufficiently established. the aim of this study was to evaluate the periodontal and microbiologic reactions to mandibular major connectors. it was hypothesized that the use of a lingual plate increases the risk of periodontal disease. materials and methods: fourteen subjects (mean age: 69.0 years) received oral hygiene instructions and ultrasonic debridement prior to examination. each subject received an experimental rpd incorporating either a lingual bar or lingual plate for the first 8 weeks and was then switched to the other option for the next 8 weeks. clinical parameters (plaque index, gingival index, probing depth, and tooth mobility) were recorded. subgingival plaque samples were collected from the periodontal pocket in the test site to measure the colonization of periodontal pathogens after the use of each denture.  results: the mean probing depth was significantly greater after use of the lingual plate compared to the lingual bar (p < .05), whereas the type of connector did not affect the levels of any of the microbial species. all subjects that exhibited at least one bacterial species showed smaller numbers of microorganisms at the second examination than at the first. conclusions: the lingual cervical coverage did not precipitate the accumulation of anaerobic microorganisms, although it could potentially induce gingival inflammation. the results suggest that a lingual plate can be used as safely as a lingual bar if oral and denture hygiene are carefully monitored.

TI  == association between selected oral pathogens and gastric precancerous lesions.
AB  == we examined whether colonization of selected oral pathogens is associated with gastric precancerous lesions in a cross-sectional study. a total of 119 participants were included, of which 37 were cases of chronic atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, or dysplasia. an oral examination was performed to measure periodontal indices. plaque and saliva samples were tested with real-time quantitative pcr for dna levels of pathogens related to periodontal disease (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) and dental caries (streptococcus mutans and s. sobrinus). there were no consistent associations between dna levels of selected bacterial species and gastric precancerous lesions, although an elevated but non-significant odds ratio (or) for gastric precancerous lesions was observed in relation to increasing colonization of a. actinomycetemcomitans (or = 1.36 for one standard deviation increase, 95% confidence interval = 0.87-2.12), p. gingivalis (or = 1.12, 0.67-1.88) and t. denticola (or = 1.34, 0.83-2.12) measured in plaque. to assess the influence of specific long-term infection, stratified analyses by levels of periodontal indices were conducted. a. actinomycetemcomitans was significantly associated with gastric precancerous lesions (or = 2.51, 1.13-5.56) among those with >/= median of percent tooth sites with pd >/= 3 mm, compared with no association among those below the median (or = 0.86, 0.43-1.72). a significantly stronger relationship was observed between the  cumulative bacterial burden score of periodontal disease-related pathogens and gastric precancerous lesions among those with higher versus lower levels of periodontal disease indices (p-values for interactions: 0.03-0.06). among individuals with periodontal disease, high levels of colonization of periodontal  pathogens are associated with an increased risk of gastric precancerous lesions.

TI  == comprehensive microbiological findings in peri-implantitis and periodontitis.
AB  == aim: the microbial differences between peri-implantitis and periodontitis in the  same subjects were examined using 16s rrna gene clone library analysis and real-time polymerase chain reaction. materials and methods: subgingival plaque samples were taken from the deepest pockets of peri-implantitis and periodontitis sites in six subjects. the prevalence of bacteria was analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: a total of 333 different taxa were identified from 799 sequenced clones; 231 (69%) were uncultivated phylotypes, of which 75 were novel. the numbers of bacterial taxa identified at the sites of peri-implantitis and periodontitis were 192 and 148 respectively. the microbial composition of peri-implantitis was more diverse when compared with that of periodontitis. fusobacterium spp. and streptococcus spp. were predominant in both peri-implantitis and periodontitis, while bacteria such  as parvimonas micra were only detected in peri-implantitis. the prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria was not high, while quantitative evaluation revealed that, in most cases, prevalence was higher at peri-implantitis sites than at periodontitis sites. conclusions: the biofilm in peri-implantitis showed a more complex microbial composition when compared with periodontitis. common periodontopathic bacteria showed low prevalence, and several bacteria were identified as candidate pathogens in peri-implantitis.

TI  == validation of a quantitative real-time pcr assay and comparison with fluorescence microscopy and selective agar plate counting for species-specific quantification  of an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  == background and objective: subgingival biofilms are the prime etiological factor of periodontal disease. owing to their complex polymicrobial nature, quantification of individual bacterial species within the biofilm for research and diagnostic purposes can be methodologically challenging. the aims of this study were to establish a quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) assay to quantify the bacteria used in our 10-species in vitro 'subgingival' biofilm model and to compare the quantitative outcome with fluorescence microscopy and colony-forming  unit (cfu) counts on selective agar plates. material and methods: the 10 species  included in the in vitro biofilm were streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, veillonella dispar, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, actinomyces oris, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. the numbers of each species were quantified at two time points using qpcr, microscopy counting following fluorescence in-situ hybridization (fish) or immunofluorescence staining, and counting of cfus after growth on selective agar plates. results: all 10 species were successfully quantified using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, and the eight species culturable on selective agar plates were also quantified by counting the numbers  of cfus after growth on selective agar. in early biofilm cultures, all methods showed a significant correlation, although the absolute numbers differed between  methods. in late biofilm cultures, measurements obtained using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, but not by cfu counts, maintained significant correlation. cfu counts yielded lower values than did measurements made using the other two methods. conclusion: quantitative pcr and epifluorescence microscopy can be easily combined with each other to determine species-specific bacterial numbers within biofilms. however, conventional bacterial cultures cannot be as efficiently combined using these molecular detection methods. this may be crucial in designing and selecting appropriate clinical diagnostic methods for subgingival biofilm samples.

TI  == [clinical importance and diagnosis of halitosis].
AB  == the origin of halitosis comes from the latin word "halitus" meaning 'breath, exhaled air', and in the hungarian terminology it means bad and smelly breath. the human body emits a number of volatile molecules, which have a peculiar odour. their presence is influenced by several factors, such as genetic, nutritional and psychological factors. since bad breath belongs to taboo subjects, halitosis can  often lead to social isolation. to determine the incidence of halitosis, an exact diagnosis is needed which sometimes predestinates the possible treatment as well. investigators estimate the incidence about 50% in the whole population. the male/female ratio is the same and the incidence is growing with age. the diagnosis can be genuine halitosis, pseudo halitosis and halitophobia. we can divide the genuine type into physiological and pathophysiological subtypes. the cause of the halitosis usually can be found in the oral cavity. the volatile sulfur compounds (vsc) produced by some of the oral bacteria are responsible for  its development. only 10% of the causes are extraoral, mostly inflammation of airways or gastrointestinal disorders. the judgment of halitosis is based on three objective methods: the organoleptic, the sulphide monitoring and the gas cromatography methods. since the origin of the halitosis is mainly the oral cavity, dentists should treat them. beyond the dental treatments the enhancement  of the oral hygiene, the continuous motivation and monitoring are also very important, such as the use of tongue cleansing and special anti-malodour rinses.

TI  == adjunctive effect of chlorhexidine antiseptics in mechanical periodontal treatment: first results of a preliminary case series.
AB  == objectives: the aim of the present case series was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects of a single session of mechanical and manual scaling and  root planing (srp) combined with the use of two different chlorhexidine formulations in the treatment for generalized chronic periodontitis. methods: ten patients affected by chronic periodontal disease with periodontal probing depth (ppd) >/= 5 mm were treated with srp plus local chlorhexidine. in each patient, similar teeth, treated with srp with the adjunctive use of chlorhexidine digluconate and dihydrochloride or chlorhexidine gluconate, respectively, were selected and assigned to a test and a control group. in both groups, ppd, bleeding on probing (bop) parameters, total bacterial counts (tbc) and quality of periodontal bacteria at time 0 and 6 weeks after treatment were measured. results: ppd significantly decreased over time both in the test and in the control group; however, no significant differences between the two groups were observed. bop and tbc were significantly lower in the test than in the control group 6 weeks after treatment. in the post-treatment revaluation, a significant decrease both in the treatment and in the control group, for each of the single periodontal pathogens, was observed. conclusion: in this study--a preliminary case series with small sample size and short follow-up--the adjunctive use of chlorhexidine (chx) to srp resulted in clinical and microbiological benefits in the treatment for generalized chronic periodontitis. a chx gel formulation consisting of chx digluconate and chx dihydrochloride seems to lead some additional benefits over srp plus chx gluconate in the short term. additional investigations are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of this antiseptic therapy.

TI  == optimization of quantitative polymerase chain reactions for detection and quantification of eight periodontal bacterial pathogens.
AB  == background: the aim of this study was to optimize quantitative (real-time) polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) assays for 8 major periodontal pathogens, i.e. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tanerella forsythia and  treponema denticola, and of the caries pathogen streptococcus mutans. results: eighteen different primer pairs were analyzed in silico regarding specificity (using blast analysis) and the presence of secondary structures at primer binding sites (using mfold). the most specific and efficiently binding primer pairs, according to these analyses, were selected for qpcr-analysis to determine amplification efficiency, limit of quantification and intra-run reproducibility.  for the selected primer pairs, one for each species, the specificity was confirmed by assessing amplification of dna extracts from isolates of closely related species. for these primer pairs, the intercycler portability was evaluated on 3 different thermal cyclers (the applied biosystems 7300, the bio-rad iq5 and the roche light cycler 480). for all assays on the different cyclers, a good correlation of the standard series was obtained (i.e. r2 >/= 0.98), but quantification limits varied among cyclers. the overall best quantification limit was obtained by using a 2 mul sample in a final volume of 10 mul on the light cycler 480. conclusions: in conclusion, the proposed assays allow to quantify the bacterial loads of s. mutans, 6 periodontal pathogenic species and the genus fusobacterium.this can be of use in assessing periodontal risk, determination of the optimal periodontal therapy and evaluation of this treatment.

TI  == treponema denticola improves adhesive capacities of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, an important etiological agent of periodontal disease,  is frequently found associated with treponema denticola, an anaerobic spirochete, in pathogenic biofilms. however, interactions between these two bacteria are not  well understood at the molecular level. in this study, we seek to link the influence of t. denticola on the expression of p. gingivalis proteases with its capacities to adhere and to form biofilms. the p. gingivalis genes encoding arg-gingipain a (rgpa), lys-gingipain (kgp), and hemagglutinin a (haga) were more strongly expressed after incubation with t. denticola compared with p. gingivalis alone. the amounts of the three resulting proteins, all of which contain hemagglutinin adhesion domains, were increased in culture supernatants. moreover, incubation of p. gingivalis with t. denticola promoted static and dynamic biofilm formation, primarily via a time-dependent enhancement of p. gingivalis adhesion capacities on bacterial partners such as streptococcus gordonii. adhesion of p. gingivalis to human cells was also increased. these results showed that interactions of p. gingivalis with other bacterial species, such as t. denticola, induce increased adhesive capacities on various substrata by hemagglutinin adhesion domain-containing proteins.

TI  == influence of periodontal status and periodontopathogens on levels of oral human beta-defensin-2 in saliva.
AB  == background: expression patterns of human beta-defensin-2 (hbd-2) mrna or hbd-2 protein concentration and periodontal diseases have been a focus of scientific research. this study compares the salivary levels of hbd-2 protein concentration  of healthy patients and patients with gingivitis and chronic periodontitis (cp) and correlates these levels with the presence of periodontopathogens. methods: a  total of 89 patients were enrolled in this study: 31 periodontally healthy, 27 with gingivitis, and 31 with cp. plaque and gingival indices, probing depth, and  clinical attachment level were measured. the presence of campylobacter rectus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia was evaluated qualitatively by conventional polymerase chain reaction. hbd-2 quantification in  saliva was performed using an immune enzymatic assay. frequency of periodontopathogens and hbd-2 protein concentration was assessed. association between hbd-2 protein concentration (>/=100 pg/ml) and the simultaneous presence  of one to two, three to four, or five to six periodontopathogens was tested. results: although periodontally healthy individuals and patients with gingivitis  showed similar hbd-2 levels, the cp group displayed an increased level of hbd-2.  p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia, and t. denticola were more prevalent  in cp; however, their mere presence was not related to the increased levels of hbd-2 (pearson correlation and multinomial logistic regression model). conclusions: salivary hbd-2 protein concentration was higher in patients with cp  compared with healthy individuals or patients with gingivitis. these different protein concentrations were not related to the frequency of periodontopathogens.  clinical inflammatory profile had a higher impact on salivary hbd-2 levels than bacteria.

TI  == frequency of periodontal pathogens in equivalent peri-implant and periodontal clinical statuses.
AB  == objectives: this study tested the hypotheses that there is: (1) higher bacterial  frequency in peri-implantitis/periodontitis, followed by mucositis/gingivitis and peri-implant/periodontal health; (2) similar bacterial frequency between comparable peri-implant and periodontal clinical statuses. design of study: the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was evaluated in peri-implant (n=53) and periodontal (n=53) health; mucositis (n=50), gingivitis (n=50), peri-implantitis (n=50) and periodontitis (n=50). results: the pattern of peri-implant bacterial frequency was not as expected (peri-implantitis>mucositis>health). except for p. intermedia (p>0.05), bacterial frequency was higher in peri-implantitis than health (p<0.05). the frequency of p.gingivalis and red complex species were higher in peri-implantitis than mucositis (p<0.05). in periodontal samples, t. forsythia and t. denticola showed the expected pattern of frequency (periodontitis>gingivitis>health). the frequencies of c. rectus and t. forsythia  were higher in healthy teeth/gingivitis than healthy implants/mucositis, respectively (p<0.05). the frequency of p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans were similar between periodontitis and peri-implantitis (p>0.05) while all other species occurrences were higher in periodontitis than peri-implantitis (p<0.05). conclusions: bacterial frequency increased from peri-implant/periodontal health to peri-implantitis/periodontitis but not from mucositis/gingivitis to peri-implantitis/periodontitis. there was a trend towards higher bacterial frequency in teeth than implants.

TI  == possible translocation of periodontal pathogens into the lymph nodes draining the oral cavity.
AB  == numerous publications have reported the presence of periodontopathogenic bacteria in peripheral and central vascular lesions. however, it is unclear how this bacterial translocation occurs. the objective of this study was to investigate whether periodontopathic bacteria are translocated to lymph nodes proximal to the oral cavity. obtaining lymph node samples is not ethically feasible unless they are excised as part of the surgical management of patients with cancer. this study analyzed formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded lymph nodes, histologically negative for cancer cell invasion, that were excised from 66 patients with histories of head and neck cancer. real-time pcr was performed to amplify the 16s ribosomal dna fragments from porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella intermedia. the relationship between bacterial detection and cancer severity, gender, and the use of anti-cancer therapy was examined by fisher's exact test. p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and p. intermedia were present in 17%, 8%, and 8% of the samples of submandibular and submental lymph nodes, respectively. there were  no significant relationships between bacterial detection and the cancer disease status, patient gender or use of anticancer therapy. according to these data, it  appears that the translocation of periodontopathic bacteria may occur via lymphatic drainage, irrespective of the cancer disease status, gender or anticancer therapy.

TI  == cleavage of igg1 in gingival crevicular fluid is associated with the presence of  porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == background and objectives: immunoglobulin (ig) g1 plays an important role in the  adaptive immune response. kgp, a lysine-specific cysteine protease from porphyromonas gingivalis, specifically hydrolyses igg1 heavy chains. the purpose  of this study was to examine whether cleavage of igg1 occurs in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) in vivo, and whether there is any association with the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis and other periodontopathogens. material and  methods: gcf was obtained from nine patients with aggressive periodontitis, nine  with chronic periodontitis and five periodontally healthy individuals. the bacterial loads of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia and tannerella  forsythia were analysed by real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the presence  and cleavage of igg1 and igg2 were determined using western blotting. kgp levels  were measured by elisa. results: cleaved igg1 was identified in the gcf from 67%  of patients with aggressive periodontitis and in 44% of patients with chronic periodontitis. by contrast, no cleaved igg1 was detectable in healthy controls. no degradation of igg2 was detected in any of the samples, regardless of health status. porphyromonas gingivalis was found in high numbers in all samples in which cleavage of igg1 was detected (p < 0.001 compared with samples with no igg  cleavage). furthermore, high numbers of tannerella forsythia and prevotella intermedia were also present in these samples. the level of kgp in the gcf correlated with the load of porphyromonas gingivalis (r = 0.425, p < 0.01). the presence of kgp (range 0.07-10.98 ng/ml) was associated with proteolytic fragments of igg1 (p < 0.001). however, cleaved igg1 was also detected in samples with no detectable kgp. conclusion: in patients with periodontitis, cleavage of igg1 occurs in vivo and may suppress antibody-dependent antibacterial activity in subgingival biofilms especially those colonized by porphyromonas gingivalis.

TI  == prediction of periodontopathic bacteria in dental plaque of periodontal healthy subjects by measurement of volatile sulfur compounds in mouth air.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to determine whether measurements of volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) are useful to predict colonization of periodontopathic bacteria. for this purpose, we assessed the relationships among  distributions of 4 species of periodontopathic bacteria in tongue coating and dental plaque, oral conditions including vsc concentration in mouth air, and smoking habit of periodontal healthy young subjects. methods: the subjects were 108 young adults (mean age, 23.5+/-2.56 years) without clinical periodontal pockets. information regarding smoking habit was obtained by interview. after vsc concentration in mouth, air was measured with a portable sulfide monitor (halimeter((r))), non-stimulated saliva flow and dental caries status were assessed, and tongue coating and dental plaque samples were collected from the subjects. the tongue coating samples were weighed to determine the amount. the colonization of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, and treponema denticola in both tongue coating and plaque samples was investigated using species-specific polymerase chain reaction assays. results: significant relationships were observed between the colonization of periodontopathic bacteria in tongue coating and plaque samples, especially that of p. gingivalis. vsc concentration showed the most significant association with  colonization of p. gingivalis in both tongue coating and dental plaque. logistic  regression analysis demonstrated that the adjusted partial correlation coefficient [exp(b)] values for vsc concentration with the colonization of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and t. denticola in dental plaque were 135, 35.4 and 10.4, respectively. in addition, smoking habit was also shown to be a significant variable in regression models [exp(b)=6.19, 8.92 and 2.53, respectively]. therefore, receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to predict the colonization of periodontal bacteria in dental plaque in the subjects divided by smoking habit. based on our results, we found cut-off values that indicated likelihood ratios (lr) within the efficient range for positive findings in both groups. conclusion: the present results demonstrated that measurement of vsc concentration in mouth air is a useful method to predict the presence of colonization of some periodontopathic bacteria in dental plaque.

AB  == the aim of this study was to use the fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) technique to test the hypothesis of qualitative and quantitative differences of 8 periodontopathogens between pregnant and non-pregnant women. this cross-sectional study included 20 pregnant women in their second trimester of pregnancy and 20 non-pregnant women. probing depth, bleeding on probing, clinical attachment level, and presence of calculus were recorded. subgingival plaque samples were collected and the fish technique identified the presence and numbers of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens. the mann-whitney u-test was applied to compare the data between the two groups. the mean age, ethnicity, marital status, education, and economic level in both groups were similar. the clinical parameters showed no significant differences between pregnant and non-pregnant women. the numbers of subgingival periodontopathogens were not found to be significantly different between groups, despite the higher mean counts of p. intermedia in pregnant women. colonization patterns of the different bacteria  most commonly associated with periodontal disease were not different in the subgingival plaque of pregnant and non-pregnant women.

TI  == a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study on the clinical and microbial  effects of an essential oil mouth rinse used by patients in supportive periodontal care.
AB  == aim: this 3-month double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study evaluated the  clinical and microbial effects of an essential oil mouth rinse used as an adjunct to mechanical plaque control by patients in supportive periodontal care. material and methods: fifty patients were randomly allocated to an essential oil group (listerine((r)) coolmint; johnson & johnson, new brunswick, nj, usa) or placebo group to rinse twice per day as an adjunct to mechanical plaque control. at baseline and after 3 months, plaque index (pi), gingivitis index (gi), probing pocket depth, bleeding on probing (bop) and clinical attachment level were registered. subgingival plaque samples were collected for the detection and quantification of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, micromonas micros, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium genus and streptococcus mutans by means of real-time pcr (qpcr). patient's compliance, satisfaction and side effects were registered. results: twenty-three patients in the essential oil group (mean age:  57) and 21 in the placebo group (mean age: 55) with acceptable oral hygiene at intake (mean pi <1.5 on a scale of 5) adhered to the study protocol. gingivitis index, pi and bop significantly reduced over time (p </= 0.029); however, between group analyses revealed no significant differences. there was no significant change over time neither in detection frequency nor load for any of the microbiota. daily rinsing with an essential oil rinse was found safe and perceived beneficial by the patients. conclusion: patients in supportive periodontal care who are fairly compliant with oral hygiene may not benefit from  additional mouth rinsing using an essential oil solution.

TI  == quantification of periodontopathic bacteria in saliva using the invader assay.
AB  == when quantifying periodontopathic bacteria, it is important to use a convenient method that does not produce false negative results. the invader assay is a convenient method because it does not involve gene amplification. the purpose of  this study was to evaluate the validity of the invader assay to quantify periodontopathic bacteria. the invader technology was applied in quantifying five periodontopathic bacteria (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, and treponema denticola). the invader assay produced a linear quantitative detection range over concentrations spanning seven exponential values, with a detection limit of 10(3.7) copies/tube and intra-day and inter-day variance of 0.1% to 4.7% and 0.1% to 3.4%, respectively, in quantifying five periodontopathic bacteria. we compared the results of the invader assay with those of real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) performed for quantifying five periodontopathic bacteria in 22 patients with periodontitis. among the invader-detectable bacterial strains of each species, significant correlations were observed in the counts of concerned bacterial species between these two methods, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.757 to 0.996. this study validated repeatability and reproducibility of the invader assay in quantifying periodontopathic bacteria and demonstrated consistent agreement between the invader assay and real-time pcr in  quantifying periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == genome-wide association study of periodontal pathogen colonization.
AB  == pathological shifts of the human microbiome are characteristic of many diseases,  including chronic periodontitis. to date, there is limited evidence on host genetic risk loci associated with periodontal pathogen colonization. we conducted a genome-wide association (gwa) study among 1,020 white participants of the atherosclerosis risk in communities study, whose periodontal diagnosis ranged from healthy to severe chronic periodontitis, and for whom "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization quantification of 8 periodontal pathogens was performed. we examined 3 traits: "high red" and "high orange" bacterial complexes, and "high" aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) colonization. genotyping was performed on the affymetrix 6.0 platform. imputation to 2.5 million markers was based on hapmap ii-ceu, and a multiple-test correction was applied (genome-wide threshold  of p < 5 x 10(-8)). we detected no genome-wide significant signals. however, 13 loci, including kcnk1, fbxo38, uhrf2, il33, runx2, trps1, camta1, and vamp3, provided suggestive evidence (p < 5 x 10(-6)) of association. all associations reported for "red" and "orange" complex microbiota, but not for aa, had the same  effect direction in a second sample of 123 african-american participants. none of these polymorphisms was associated with periodontitis diagnosis. investigations replicating these findings may lead to an improved understanding of the complex nature of host-microbiome interactions that characterizes states of health and disease.

TI  == do elderly edentulous patients with a history of periodontitis harbor periodontal pathogens?
AB  == objectives: the presence of periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity may impact implant survival. therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, eikenella corrodens, and parvimonas micra in a specific elderly population with a history of periodontitis who have never worn dentures. material and methods: thirty dentate subjects (mean age 61.7 +/- 7.05 years) and 30 edentulous subjects (mean age 65.8 +/- 8.05 years) were included in this cross-sectional study. microbiological samples of cheek mucosa and the dorsum of  the tongue were taken from all subjects. in addition, sulcus samples were taken from the dentate group. all samples were analysed using a bacterial dna-specific  polymerase chain reaction. results: all the pathogens studied were detected in dentate and edentulous subjects. when cheek and tongue samples were combined, c.  rectus, a. actinomycetemcomitans and e. corrodens presented with a similar prevalence in both groups, whereas the other species were more prevalent specifically in the dentate group (p<0.05). in dentate subjects, p. intermedia and t. denticola were present in higher frequencies in the cheek mucosa (26.67% and 66.67%, respectively), whereas p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were more prevalent in the tongue samples (26.67% and 56.67%, respectively). conclusions: periodontal pathogens may persist in the oral cavity of edentulous subjects who have had periodontal disease, even 1 year after the extraction of all teeth and in the absence of other hard surfaces in the mouth.

TI  == long-term follow-up of turned single implants placed in periodontally healthy patients after 16 to 22 years: microbiologic outcome.
AB  == background: survival rates in implant dentistry today are high, although late failures do occur for many reasons, including peri-implant infections. the primary objective of this study is to investigate microbiota around single turned implants after 16 to 22 years. secondary objectives are to compare teeth and implants and to correlate microbiologic, radiographic, and clinical parameters. methods: a total of 46 patients with single implants were invited for a clinical  examination. clinical data were collected from implants and contralateral natural teeth. radiographic bone level was measured around implants. microbiologic samples were taken from implants, contralateral teeth, and the deepest pocket per quadrant. samples were analyzed with dna-dna hybridization including 40 species.  statistical analysis was performed using wilcoxon signed-rank tests, mcnemar tests, and spearman correlation coefficients with a 0.05 significance level. results: mean follow-up was 18.5 years (range 16 to 22 years). tannerella forsythia (1.5 x 10(5)) and veillonella parvula (1.02 x 10(5)) showed the highest concentrations around implants and teeth, respectively. porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and t. forsythia were significantly more present around implants than teeth. mean counts were significantly higher around implants than teeth for parvimonas micra, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia, and treponema denticola. total dna count was correlated to interproximal bleeding index (r = 0.409) and interproximal probing depth (r = 0.307). no correlations were present with plaque index or radiographic bone level. conclusions: in the present study, bacterial counts around single implants in periodontally healthy patients are rather low. although pathogenic bacteria are present, some in higher numbers around implants than teeth (five of 40), the majority of implants present with healthy peri-implant tissues without progressive bone loss.

TI  == association of cd14-260 polymorphisms, red-complex periodontopathogens and gingival crevicular fluid cytokine levels with cyclosporine a-induced gingival overgrowth in renal transplant patients.
AB  == backgroud and objective: genetic factors may influence the colonization of pathogenic bacteria, therefore increasing the risk for the initiation and development of periodontal disease. the present study was carried out to investigate the association of cd14-260 polymorphisms, subgingival microbiota, and gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) cytokine levels with cyclosporine a (csa)-induced gingival overgrowth (go) in renal transplant patients. material and methods: a total of 204 patients were dichotomized into two groups: 124 with go and 80 without go. the cd14-260 polymorphisms were measured using an allele-specific pcr method. the levels of periodontal pathogens were determined by real-time pcr of subgingival samples. gcf levels of il-1beta and scd14 were detected by elisa. results: the frequency of cd14-260 genotype ct + tt was found  to be similar in both groups. patients with go presented increased prevalence of  pg, td, and tf (red complex) and significantly higher levels of interleukin -1beta than those without go. patients with go carrying ct + tt genotypes were found to have higher frequencies of pg, td, and tf than those carrying the cc genotype. furthermore, in the presence of red complex, ct + tt genotypes were associated with higher interleukin -1beta levels and severe go. multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the severity of go is not dependent on age, gender and pharmacological variables, being only associated with cd14-260 genotype and red complex periodontopathogens. conclusion: no association between  cd14-260 polymorphisms and the prevalence of go was revealed in renal transplant  patients administered csa. however, cd14-260 ct + tt genotypes are associated with the prevalence of red complex periodontopathogens in patients with go, and may thus play some role in the development of severe csa-induced go.

TI  == insights into the virulence of oral biofilms: discoveries from proteomics.
AB  == this review covers developments in the study of polymicrobial communities, biofilms and selected areas of host response relevant to dental plaque and related areas of oral biology. the emphasis is on recent studies in which proteomic methods, particularly those using mass spectrometry as a readout, have  played a major role in the investigation. the last 5-10 years have seen a transition of such methods from the periphery of oral biology to the mainstream,  as in other areas of biomedical science. for reasons of focus and space, the authors do not discuss biomarker studies relevant to improved diagnostics for oral health, as this literature is rather substantial in its own right and deserves a separate treatment. here, global gene regulation studies of plaque-component organisms, biofilm formation, multispecies interactions and host-microbe interactions are discussed. several aspects of proteomics methodology that are relevant to the studies of multispecies systems are commented upon.

TI  == differential proteomic analysis of a polymicrobial biofilm.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia exist in  a polymicrobial biofilm associated with chronic periodontitis. the aim of this study was to culture these three species as a polymicrobial biofilm and to determine proteins important for bacterial interactions. in a flow cell all three species attached and grew as a biofilm; however, after 90 h of culture p. gingivalis and t. denticola were closely associated and dominated the polymicrobial biofilm. for comparison, planktonic cultures of p. gingivalis and t. denticola were grown separately in continuous culture. whole cell lysates were subjected to sds-page, followed by in-gel proteolytic h(2)(1)(6)o/h(2)(1)(8)o labeling. from two replicates, 135 and 174 p. gingivalis proteins and 134 and 194 t. denticola proteins were quantified by lc-maldi tof/tof ms. the results suggest a change of strategy in iron acquisition by p. gingivalis due to large increases  in the abundance of husa and husb in the polymicrobial biofilm while hmuy and other iron/haem transport systems decreased. significant changes in the abundance of peptidases and enzymes involved in glutamate and glycine catabolism suggest syntrophy. these data indicate an intimate association between p. gingivalis and  t. denticola in a biofilm that may play a role in disease pathogenesis.

TI  == clinical and microbiological parameters in patients with self-ligating and conventional brackets during early phase of orthodontic treatment.
AB  == objective: to determine the effect of different bracket designs (conventional brackets and self-ligating brackets) on periodontal clinical parameters and periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque. material and methods: the following  inclusion criteria were used: requirement of orthodontic treatment plan starting  with alignment and leveling, good general health, healthy periodontium, no antibiotic therapy in the previous 6 months before the beginning of the study, and no smoking. the study sample totaled 38 patients (13 male, 25 female; mean age, 14.6 +/- 2.0 years). patients were divided into two groups with random distribution of brackets. recording of clinical parameters was done before the placement of the orthodontic appliance (t0) and at 6 weeks (t1), 12 weeks (t2), and 18 weeks (t3) after full bonding of orthodontic appliances. periodontal pathogens of subgingival microflora were detected at t3 using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test (micro-dent test) that contains probes for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. results: there was a statistically significant higher prevalence of a actinomycetemcomitans in patients with conventional brackets than in patients with self-ligating brackets, but there was no statistically significant difference for other putative periodontal pathogens. the two different types of brackets did not show statistically significant differences in periodontal clinical parameters. conclusion: bracket design does not seem to have a strong influence on periodontal clinical parameters and periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque.  the correlation between some periodontal pathogens and clinical periodontal parameters was weak.

TI  == occurrence of periodontal pathogens among patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence of the periodontal pathogens that form the red complex (tannerella forsythia, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola) and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in  patients with chronic periodontitis. the sample consisted of 29 patients with a clinical and radiographic diagnosis of chronic periodontitis based on the criteria of the american academy of periodontology (3). samples for microbiological analysis were collected from the four sites of greatest probing depth in each patient, totaling 116 samples. these samples were processed using conventional polymerase chain reaction, which achieved the following positive results: 46.6% for p. gingivalis, 41.4% for t. forsythia, 33.6% for t. denticola  and 27.6% for a. actinomycetemcomitans. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were more  prevalent (p < 0.05) in periodontal pockets >/= 8 mm. the combinations t. forsythia + p. gingivalis (23.2%) and t. forsythia + p. gingivalis + t. denticola (20.0%) were more frequent in sites with a probing depth >/= 8 mm. associations with the simultaneous presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans + p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans + t. forsythia, p. gingivalis + t. forsythia and t. forsythia + t. denticola were statistically significant (p < 0.05). it was concluded that the red complex pathogens are related to chronic periodontitis, presenting a higher occurrence in deep periodontal pockets. moreover, the simultaneous presence of these bacteria in deep sites suggests a symbiotic relationship between these virulent species, favoring, in this way, a further progression of periodontal disease.

TI  == [amalgam, composite and compomer: microbiological study].
AB  == restorative materials have different consequences on the periodontium. the surface of these materials may influence gingival health and cause in some instances gingival inflammation. the purpose of this study was to investigate and compare, in a healthy periodontium, intracrevicular plaque bacteria (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis and treponema denticola), at day 0 and at 6 months, around subgingivally located amalgam, composite and compomer fillings. all the tests were negative (less than 0.1% of the sum of 103 cells), since none  of the investigated pathogens were detected. it has been concluded that the material used does not have direct effect on the bacteria species developed around the restorations at this short time period.

TI  == er:yag laser in the treatment of periodontal sites with recurring chronic inflammation: a 12-month randomized, controlled clinical trial.
AB  == aim: the objective of this randomized, controlled clinical trial was to compare the clinical and microbiological effects of pocket debridement using erbium-doped: yttrium, aluminium and garnet (er:yag) laser with conventional debridement in maintenance patients. material & methods: fifteen patients, all smokers, having at least four teeth with residual probing depth (pd) >/= 5 mm were recruited. two pockets in two jaw quadrants were randomly assigned to subgingival debridement using an er:yag laser (test) or ultrasonic scaler/curette (control) at 3-month intervals. relative attachment level (ral), pd, bleeding on  probing and dental plaque were recorded at baseline and at 6 and 12 months. microbiological subgingival samples were taken at the same time points and analysed using a checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: a significant decrease in pd took place in both treatments from baseline to 12 months (p < 0.01). in the control, the mean initial pd decreased from 5.4 to 4.0  mm at 12 months. for the test, a similar decrease occurred. no significant between-treatment differences were shown at any time point. the mean ral showed no overall significant inter- or intra-treatment differences (p > 0.05). no significant between-treatment differences were observed in subgingival microbiological composition or total pathogens. conclusion: the results failed to support that an er:yag laser may be superior to conventional debridement in the treatment of smokers with recurring chronic inflammation. this appears to be the  first time that repeated er-yag laser instrumentation has been compared with mechanical instrumentation of periodontal sites with recurring chronic inflammation over a clinically relevant time period.

TI  == peripheral arterial disease associated with caries and periodontal disease.
AB  == background: peripheral arterial disease (pad) is an important cardiovascular disorder of the peripheral arteries. chronic infections, such as periodontitis, may play an important role in the etiology and pathophysiology of pad and other cardiovascular conditions. recently, streptococcus mutans has been found with high frequency in atheromatous plaques. the aim of this study is to evaluate the  possible clinical and microbiologic association between pad and periodontitis and dental caries. methods: thirty patients with pad and 30 control individuals were  selected. pad and its severity were established by the use of the ankle-brachial  index (abi). clinical attachment loss (al); probing depth; decayed, missing, and  filled teeth (dmft) index; and c-reactive protein (crp) levels were evaluated. the presence of bacterial dna from streptococcus mutans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was identified by polymerase chain reaction in subgingival biofilm and serum. results: patients with >/=30% al >/= 4 mm had six-fold increased risk of having pad (odds ratio = 8.18; 95% confidence interval = 1.21 to 35.23; p = 0.031). there was statistical difference in the crp (p = 0.0413) and dmft index (p = 0.0002), with elevated number of missing teeth (p = 0.0459) in the pad group compared with the control group. there were no significant differences in the frequency of bacteria in serum and subgingival plaque. conclusion: there was a positive relationship between periodontitis based on al and pad determined by the abi (odds ratio = 8.18).

TI  == autoinducer 2 of fusobacterium nucleatum as a target molecule to inhibit biofilm  formation of periodontopathogens.
AB  == periodontitis is initiated by bacteria in subgingival biofilms, which are composed mostly of gram-negative anaerobes. autoinducer 2 (ai-2) is a universal quorum sensing (qs) molecule that mediates intergeneric signalling in multispecies bacterial communities and may induce biofilm formation. as fusobacterium nucleatum is the major coaggregation bridge organism that links early colonising commensals and late pathogenic colonisers in dental biofilms via the accretion of periodontopathogens, we hypothesised that ai-2 of f. nucleatum contributes to this interspecies interaction, and interruption of this signalling could result in the inhibition of biofilm formation of periodontopathogens. to test this hypothesis, we evaluated the effect of partially purified f. nucleatum  ai-2 on monospecies biofilm as well as mutualistic interactions between f. nucleatum and the so-called 'red complex' (porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia). then we tested the effect of two qs inhibitors (qsis), (5z)-4-bromo-5-(bromomethylene)-2(5h)-furanone (furanone compound) and d-ribose, on ai-2-induced biofilm formation and coaggregation. f. nucleatum ai-2 remarkably induced biofilm growth of single and dual species and coaggregation between f. nucleatum and each species of the 'red complex', all of  which were inhibited by the qsis. f. nucleatum ai-2 induced the expression of the representative adhesion molecules of the periodontopathogens, which were inhibited by the qsis. our results demonstrate that f. nucleatum ai-2 plays an important role in inter- and intraspecies interactions between periodontopathogens via enhanced expression of adhesion molecules and may be a target for the inhibition of pathogenic dental biofilm formation.

TI  == the short-term treatment effects on the microbiota at the dorsum of the tongue in intra-oral halitosis patients--a randomized clinical trial.
AB  == objectives: this study aims to assess the effects of rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse with or without adjunct tongue scraping on volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) in breath air, and the microbiota at the dorsum  of the tongue. material and methods: a randomized single-masked controlled clinical trial with a cross-over study design over 14 days including 21 subjects  was performed. bacterial samples from the dorsum of the tongue were assayed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: no halitosis (identified by vsc assessments) at day 14 was identified in 12/21 subjects with active rinse alone,  in 10/21 with adjunct use of tongue scraper, in 1/21 for negative control rinse alone, and in 3/21 in the control and tongue scraping sequence. at day 14, significantly lower counts were identified only in the active rinse sequence (p < 0.001) for 15/78 species including, fusobacterium sp., porphyromonas gingivalis,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and tannerella forsythia. a decrease in bacteria from baseline to day 14 was found in successfully treated subjects for 9/74 species including: p. gingivalis, prevotella melaninogenica, s. aureus, and treponema denticola. baseline vsc scores were correlated with several bacterial species. the use of a tongue scraper combined with active rinse did not change the levels of vsc compared to rinsing alone. conclusions: vsc scores were  not associated with bacterial counts in samples taken from the dorsum of the tongue. the active rinse alone containing zinc and chlorhexidine had effects on intra-oral halitosis and reduced bacterial counts of species associated with malodor. tongue scraping provided no beneficial effects on the microbiota studied. clinical relevance: periodontally healthy subjects with intra-oral halitosis benefit from daily rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse.

TI  == serum antibodies to periodontal pathogens are a risk factor for alzheimer's disease.
AB  == background: chronic inflammation in periodontal disease has been suggested as a potential risk factor in alzheimer's disease (ad). the purpose of this study was  to examine serum antibody levels to bacteria of periodontal disease in participants who eventually converted to ad compared with the antibody levels in  control subjects. methods: serum samples from 158 participants in the biologically resilient adults in neurological studies research program at the university of kentucky were analyzed for immunoglobulin g antibody levels to seven oral bacteria associated with periodontitis, including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus, treponema  denticola, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella intermedia. all 158 participants were cognitively intact at baseline venous blood draw. in all, 81 of the participants developed either mild cognitive impairment (mci) or ad or both, and 77 controls remained cognitively intact in the years of  follow-up. antibody levels were compared between controls and subjects with ad at baseline draw and after conversion and controls and subjects with mci at baseline draw and after conversion using the wilcoxon rank-sum test. ad and mci participants were not directly compared. linear regression models were used to adjust for potential confounding. results: antibody levels to f nucleatum and p intermedia were significantly increased (alpha = 0.05) at baseline serum draw in  the patients with ad compared with controls. these results remained significant when controlling for baseline age, mini-mental state examination score, and apolipoprotein epsilon 4 status. conclusions: this study provides initial data that demonstrate elevated antibodies to periodontal disease bacteria in subjects  years before cognitive impairment and suggests that periodontal disease could potentially contribute to the risk of ad onset/progression. additional cohort studies profiling oral clinical presentation with systemic response and ad and prospective studies to evaluate any cause-and-effect association are warranted.

AB  == background: oral mucositis is a serious and debilitating side effect of conditioning regimens for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (hsct). through hsct, the homeostasis in the oral cavity is disrupted. the contribution of the oral microflora to mucositis remains to be clarified. the aim of our study was to investigate the relationship between yeasts, bacteria associated with periodontitis, and oral ulcerations in hsct recipients. methods: this prospective observational study included 49 adult hsct recipients. twice weekly, oral ulcerations were scored, and oral rinsing samples were obtained. samples were evaluated for the total bacterial load; the gram-negative bacteria: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, and  treponema denticola; and the yeasts: candida albicans, candida glabrata, candida  kefyr, candida krusei, candida parapsilosis, and candida tropicalis using real-time polymerase chain reaction with specific primers and probes. explanatory variables for oral ulcerations were calculated using the multilevel generalized estimated equations (gee) technique. results: none of the samples was positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans, while f. nucleatum was found most often (66 % of samples). c. albicans was the most isolated yeast (88 % of samples), whereas c. parapsilosis was found in only 8 % of the samples. multivariate gee analyses identified p. gingivalis, p. micra, t. denticola, f. nucleatum, c. glabrata, and  c. kefyr as significant explanatory variables of oral ulcerations. conclusions: our data indicate that p. gingivalis in particular, but also p. micra, t. denticola, f. nucleatum, c. glabrata, and c. kefyr may play a role in ulcerative  oral mucositis in patients undergoing hsct.

TI  == quantification of subgingival bacterial pathogens at different stages of periodontal diseases.
AB  == anaerobic gram-negative oral bacteria such as treponema denticola, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, campylobacter rectus, and fusobacterium nucleatum are closely associated with periodontal diseases. we measured the relative population (bacterial levels) of these oral pathogens in subgingival tissues of patients at  different stages of korean chronic periodontal diseases. we divided the individuals into those with chronic gingivitis (g), moderate periodontitis (p1),  severe periodontitis (p2), and normal individuals (n) (n = 20 for each group) and subgingival tissue samples were collected. we used real-time pcr with taqman probes to evaluate the change of periodontal pathogens among different stages of  periodontitis. bacterial levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans and c. rectus are significantly increased in individuals with chronic gingivitis and moderate periodontitis, but unchanged in severe periodontitis patients. these results suggest that analyzing certain bacterial levels among total oral pathogens may facilitate understanding of the role of periodontal bacteria in the early stages  of periodontitis.

TI  == individual composition of human leukocyte antigens and periodontopathogens in the background of periodontitis.
AB  == background: human leukocyte antigens (hlas) are a basic precondition to induce the immune response to pathogens. therefore, this study evaluates associations among periodontitis, five key periodontopathic bacteria, and hlas to test their impact together with additional risk factors in multivariate analyses. methods: eighty-five patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp) and 71 patients with generalized chronic periodontitis (cp) were compared to 88 periodontitis-free controls. hla class i and ii typing was performed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with sequence-specific primers. subgingival plaque specimens were detected by pcr with sequence-specific oligonucleotides. risk-factor analyses were performed with respect to the cofactors age, sex, smoking, and plaque level by logistic regression. results: in the total patient group (gagp + cp), the adjusted odds ratio (or) of periodontitis was decreased in cases who were carriers of hla-b*57 (or = 0.259, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 0.086 to 0.782), hla-dqb1*08 (or = 0.404, 95% ci = 0.187 to 0.871), or the combination hla-drb1*04;drb4*;dqb1*0302 (or = 0.407, 95% ci = 0.185 to 0.895). moreover, individuals who expressed hla-drb1*04 (or = 0.36, 95% ci = 0.148 to 0.886) or hla-drb1*04;drb4*;dqb1*0302 (or = 0.29, 95% ci = 0.092 to 0.884) had a  decreased colonization risk with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. conclusions: certain hla markers were negatively associated to the manifestation  of a generalized periodontitis and/or the individual colonization of a. actinomycetemcomitans. the underlying mechanisms have to be investigated in future studies.

TI  == microbial profiles of patients seeking treatment for periodontitis. influence of  origin, smoking and age?
AB  == purpose: we assessed the potential influence of the origin, the smoking status and the age on subgingival microbial profiles of subjects seeking periodontal care in switzerland today. material and methods: subgingival samples were obtained from 182 subjects originating from 44 countries (56 native swiss, 64 other european, 43 african, 19 others), seeking periodontal treatment at the school of dental medicine at the university of geneva. four periodontal microorganisms were quantified by direct hybridization with specific rna probes.  results: tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were ubiquitous (95.6%, 93.9%), and porphyromonas gingivalis was frequently detected (89%). counts correlated with the size of the microbial sample (total load). aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was detected in only 70 (38.4%) subjects. counts were highly variable and unrelated to total load. subjects less than 46.8 years old (median age) had a higher risk to be positive than older subjects. detection frequencies and counts of all four organisms were unrelated to the origin or the  smoking status. conclusions: based on a clinical diagnosis of untreated periodontitis, positive outcomes of tests for t. forsythia, t. denticola and p. gingivalis could be predicted with high confidence irrespective of a patient;'s origin, smoking status or age. detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans was less frequent and depended on the age of the subject.

TI  == distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in dogs and their owners.
AB  == objective: presently, a large number of individuals consider their companion animals as family members and have close contact with them in daily life. the purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution of periodontopathic  bacterial species in oral specimens taken from dogs and their owners. design: dental plaque specimens were collected from 66 dogs and 81 members of 64 families who came to an animal clinic or dog training school in okayama, japan, in 2011. bacterial dna was extracted from each specimen and pcr analyses using primers specific for 11 periodontopathic species, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas gulae, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens were performed. results: p. gulae (71.2%), t. forsythia (77.3%), and c. rectus (66.7%) were frequently found in the dogs, whereas the detection rates of  those species in humans were less frequent at 16.0%, 30.9%, and 21.0%, respectively. p. gulae was identified in 13 human subjects and each of their dogs was also positive for the species. furthermore, e. corrodens and t. denticola in  specimens obtained from dogs were correlated with their presence in specimens from owners who had close contact with them. conclusions: these results suggest that several periodontopathic species could be transmitted between humans and their companion dogs, though the distribution of periodontopathic species in both is generally different.

TI  == alveolar bone loss associated with age-related macular degeneration in males.
AB  == background: the aim of this study is to examine the relationship of selected systemic and oral health parameters and the salivary presence of six periodontal  pathogens to age-related macular degeneration (amd). methods: the present cross-sectional study includes data on 1,751 individuals (>/=30 years old). general health information was obtained by questionnaires and interviews, including self-reported diagnosis of amd, as well as by the general and oral health examination, including panoramic radiography and laboratory analyses. fifty-four individuals with degenerative fundus changes formed the amd group, and the other 1,697 formed the non-amd group. pearson chi(2) and analysis of variance tests were used for comparisons of categorical parameters and continuous parameters between the participant groups, respectively. a logistic regression analysis was performed to study the association of amd with alveolar bone loss and the number of teeth by controlling for age, diabetic status, systolic blood pressure, education, and smoking, and also for the carriage of salivary bacteria. results: advanced age, systolic blood pressure, and diabetes were associated with amd (p <0.001), whereas the carriage rates of the examined periodontal pathogens  were not. in the whole study population, the participants with amd had fewer teeth (p <0.001) and more alveolar bone loss (p = 0.004) compared with non-amd participants. in a logistic regression model adjusted for age, smoking, and diabetes, alveolar bone loss was associated with amd in males with an odds ratio  of 4.3 (95% confidence interval = 1.3 to 14.6, p = 0.013). conclusion: in this population-based health survey, alveolar bone loss is independently associated with amd in males.

TI  == periodontal vaccine.
AB  == vaccine is the name applied generally to a substance of the nature of dead or attenuated living infectious material introduced into the body with the object of increasing its power to resist or get rid of a disease. vaccines are generally prophylactic, i.e. they ameliorate the effects of future infection. one such vaccine considered here is the "periodontal vaccine". till date, no preventive modality exists for periodontal disease and treatment rendered is palliative. thus, availability of periodontal vaccine would not only prevent and modulate periodontal disease, but also enhance the quality of life of people for whom periodontal treatment cannot be easily obtained. the aim of the research should be development of a multispecies vaccine targeting the four prime periodontal pathogens, viz. porphyromonas gingivalis, t. forsythus, t. denticola and a. comitans. success is still elusive in case of periodontal vaccine due to the complex etiopathogenesis of the disease.

TI  == comparative evaluation of the effects of different photoablative laser irradiation protocols on the gingiva of periodontopathic patients.
AB  == objective: we aimed at quantifying the presence of periodontopathogens in gingival biopsies from periodontitis patients treated with different photoablative lasers (diode gaas, er:yag, nd:yag, and co(2) lasers) and histologically analyzing their effects on the gingiva. background data: substantial evidence indicates that intracellular location of periodontal bacteria in the gingival epithelium may contribute to chronic periodontitis. methods: sixteen adult subjects with chronic periodontitis were subjected to conventional scaling/root planing and topical chlorhexidine, and immediately laser-irradiated on the inner and outer free gingiva. small gingival biopsies were subjected to real-time polymerase chain reaction and cytofluorescence to identify periodontopathogens; tissue damage and endothelial icam-1 expression were assessed by histological and immunofluorescence analyses. results: high dna  levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, and ekenella corrodens, were detected in all samples. nd:yag and diode lasers were capable of  eradicating periodontopathogenic bacteria endowed within gingival epithelial cells outside periodontal pockets, without causing connective tissue damage and microvessel rupture. they also reduced icam-1 immunolabelling by the vascular endothelium. conversely, er:yag lasers induced marked microvessel rupture and bleeding and failed to completely and selectively ablate the infected gingival epithelium, whereas co(2) laser caused heat-induced coagulation of the lamina propria. conclusions: this study indicates that periodontopathogens can persist within cells outside the pocket epithelium, despite conventional periodontal treatment. nd:yag and diode lasers are able to eradicate intra- and extracellular bacteria from these sites, suggesting that they can be considered suitable devices to improve the clinical outcome of periodontal disease.

TI  == regenerative therapy of infrabony defects with or without systemic doxycycline. a randomized placebo-controlled trial.
AB  == aim: comparison of regenerative therapy of infrabony defects with and without administration of postsurgical systemic doxycycline (doxy). methods: in each of 61 patients one infrabony defect was treated with enamel matrix derivative (emd), emd plus filler or membrane at two centres. by random assignment patients received either 200 mg doxy per day or placebo (plac) for 7 days after surgery. prior to and 6 months after surgery probing pocket depths (ppd) and vertical attachment level (pal-v) were obtained. results: fifty-four patients (doxy: 27; plac: 27) were re-examined after 6 months and had been treated exclusively with emd. seven to 8 days after surgery 81% of defects in both groups showed complete  flap closure. in both groups significant (p < 0.001) ppd reduction (doxy: 3.87 +/- 1.44 mm; plac: 3.67 +/- 1.30 mm) and pal-v gain (doxy: 3.11 +/- 1.50 mm; plac: 3.32 +/- 1.83 mm) were observed. however, the differences failed to be statistically significant (ppd: 0.20; p = 0.588; pal-v: 0.21; p = 0.657). conclusions: two hundred milligram systemic doxy administered for 7 days after therapy of infrabony defects with emd failed to result in better ppd reduction and pal-v gain compared with plac which may be due to low power (50%) and, thus,  random chance.

TI  == oral microbiota in swiss adolescents.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of the study was to determine the prevalence of different oral microbes in gingival plaque samples and in samples from the dorsum of the tongue in a swiss adolescent population. materials and methods: ninety-nine adolescents between 15 and 18 years were enrolled. plaque index, bleeding on probing (bop), the periodontal screening index, and decayed missed filled tooth (dmft) index were recorded. samples from subgingival plaque and swabs from the tongue were analyzed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. additionally, counts of streptococus mutans and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were determined by real-time pcr. results: periodontitis was  not diagnosed in any of the subjects but all of them presented signs of gingival  inflammation displaying a mean bop of 28%. ten (10.1%) subjects were tested positive for p. gingivalis, each 22 (22.2%) for a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. forsythia, (47.5%) for t. denticola. t. denticola and s. mutans showed a high affinity to the gingival plaque, whereas t. forsythia was often detected from the dorsum of the tongue. dmft was associated with s. mutans counts, and bop correlated with counts of p. gingivalis and t. denticola. conclusions: the present data indicate that: (a) gingivitis but not periodontitis is a common finding among swiss adolescents, and (b) bacteria associated with periodontitis were frequently detected in the subgingival dental plaque and on the dorsum of the tongue in swiss adolescents with gingivitis. clinical relevance: although gingivitis was a frequent finding in swiss adolescents, periodontitis was not detected in this population. the dorsum of the tongue appears to represent an important reservoir for periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == [effect of periodontal surgery on the subgingival periodontal microbiota in artificial class iii furcation defects: an experimental study in monkeys].
AB  == objective: this study was to longitudinally evaluate the change of prevalence of  five periodontal putative pathogens in the subgingival plaque of artificial class iii furcation defects at the three time-points, including before the establishment of furcation defects, before and 6 months after periodontal surgery. methods: eighteen chronic infected class iii fi defects were created at  the mandibular first molars, second molars and second premolars of three adult male macaca fascicularis. the samples of subgingival plaque were obtained from the subgingival area of furcation defects in buccal and lingual sites before the  establishment of furcation defects, before and 6 months after periodontal surgery. 36 samples were obtained at one time-points. five periodontal putative pathogens, including porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythensis (tf), treponema dinticola (td), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa) and fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), were detected with 16srrna based pcr. results: 1. the prevalence of pg, tf, td and fn was gradually increased, from 58.3% to 69.4%  to 88.9%, 47,2% to 69.4% to 83.3%, 13.9% to 36.1% to 61.1% (p<0.01), and 69.4% to 91.7% to 91.7% (p<0.05), respectively during the experimental period. the prevalence of fn was higher than pg, tf and td. the prevalence of aa was the lowest and no obvious difference among the three samplings(from 25.9% to 13.9% to 33.3%)was detected. 2. the prevalence of more than 3 species simultaneously detected was increased from 38.9% to 61.1% to 83.3% (p <0.01). the red complex (pg + tf + td) was detected from 8.3% to 27.8% to 44.4% (p<0.01) at the different time point. 3. the combined detection frequency of red complex in the inflammatory sites (87.5%), which were histologically defined as inflammatory cells infiltrated in furcation area 6 months post-surgery, and the same sites pre-surgery (62.5%) was more than that in pre-creation of furcation defects (p<0.01). but there were no significant differences compared to that in non inflammatory area (60.0%, 40.0%), respectively. conclusion: the prevalence of periodontal pathogenic bacteria correlated with the severity of local inflammation. the increase of coexistent rate of red complex at the second and third sampling times suggests that the red complex play important role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. fn may be a resident bacteria in the subgingival plaque, play a bridge role on the biofilm formation and maturation. aa may not be a major causative bacteria in the clinical periodontitis.

TI  == treponema denticola chymotrypsin-like proteinase (ctlp) integrates spirochaetes within oral microbial communities.
AB  == treponema denticola is found ubiquitously in the human oral cavity and is mainly  associated with bacterial communities implicated in the establishment and development of periodontal disease. the ability to become integrated within biofilm communities is crucial to the growth and survival of oral bacteria, and involves inter-bacterial coaggregation, metabolic cooperation, and synergy against host defences. in this article we show that the chymotrypsin-like proteinase (ctlp), found within a high-molecular-mass complex on the cell surface, mediates adherence of t. denticola to other potential periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and parvimonas micra. proteolytic activity per se did not appear to be required for the interactions, and expression of the major outer-sheath protein (msp) was not necessary, except for binding parv. micra. biofilms of densely packed cells and matrix, up to 40 microm in depth, were formed between t. denticola and p. gingivalis on salivary pellicle, with t. denticola cells enriched in the upper layers. expression of ctlp, but not msp, was critical for dual-species biofilm formation with p. gingivalis. t. denticola did not form dual-species biofilms with any of the other three periodontal bacterial species under various conditions. synergy between t. denticola and p. gingivalis was also shown by increased inhibition of blood clotting, which was ctlp-dependent. the results demonstrate the critical role of ctlp in interactions of t. denticola with other oral micro-organisms, leading to synergy in microbial community development and host tissue pathogenesis.

TI  == detection of periodontal bacteria in thrombi of patients with acute myocardial infarction by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == backgrounds: numerous reports have demonstrated that periodontal bacteria are present in plaques from atherosclerotic arteries. although periodontitis has recently been recognized as a risk factor for coronary artery disease, the direct relationship between periodontal bacteria and coronary artery disease has not yet been clarified. it has been suggested that these bacteria might contribute to inflammation and plaque instability. we assumed that if periodontal bacteria induce inflammation of plaque, the bacteria would be released into the bloodstream when vulnerable plaque ruptures. to determine whether periodontal bacteria are present in thrombi at the site of acute myocardial infarction, we tried to detect periodontal bacteria in thrombi of patients with acute myocardial infarction by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). methods: we studied 81 consecutive adults with st-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pci). all patients underwent removal  of thrombus with aspiration catheters at the beginning of percutaneous coronary intervention, and a small sample of thrombus was obtained for pcr. results: the detection rates of periodontal bacteria by pcr were 19.7% for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, 3.4% for porphyromonas gingivalis, and 2.3% for treponema  denticola. conclusions: three species of periodontal bacteria were detected in the thrombi of patients with acute myocardial infarction. this raises the possibility that such bacteria are latently present in plaque and also suggests that these bacteria might have a role in plaque inflammation and instability.

TI  == microbial profile of patients with periodontitis compared with healthy subjects.
AB  == objective: to define and compare the microbiologic profile of subgingival plaque  in german patients with periodontitis (including aggressive and advanced chronic  periodontitis) and healthy subjects and to determine significant association between isolates and clinical status. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia are major periodontal pathogens, though it is recognized that other species may also contribute to the  pathogenesis of periodontal disease. method and materials: thirty-three patients  with clinical and radiologic proof of aggressive and advanced chronic periodontitis and 20 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. clinical indices were recorded as six-point measurements on each tooth. samples of the subgingival plaque were taken with paper points from four teeth of each individual. the samples were divided into two parts. one part was immediately cultivated, while the other one was stored at -20 degrees c until analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: a total of 284 anaerobic isolates (224 isolates from patients and 60 isolates from healthy controls) were identified. forty different anaerobic species were isolated, with a mean of 6.78  species per patient and 3 species per healthy control subject. significant differences in prevalence (after adjusting for multiple comparisons, p < .001) were found for prevotella intermedia and nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, t forsythia, treponema denticola, and veillonella parvula. the first four species were associated with the aggressive periodontitis group and v parvula with healthy subjects. conclusion: when compared with healthy controls, the microbial  profile of subgingival plaque from periodontitis was found to contain known periodontal pathogens with a different prevalence to that described in earlier studies. p intermedia/nigrescens, f nucleatum, t forsythia, and t denticola have  been found in lower proportions and small quantities in healthy subjects.

TI  == periodontal pathogens affect the level of protease inhibitors in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == in periodontitis, an effective host-response is primarily related to neutrophils  loaded with serine proteases, including elastase (ne) and protease 3 (pr3), the extracellular activity of which is tightly controlled by endogenous inhibitors. in vitro these inhibitors are degraded by gingipains, cysteine proteases produced by porphyromonas gingivalis. the purpose of this study was to determine the level of selected protease inhibitors in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) in relation to periodontal infection. the gcf collected from 31 subjects (nine healthy controls, seven with gingivitis, five with aggressive periodontitis and 10 with chronic periodontitis) was analyzed for the levels of elafin and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), two main tissue-derived inhibitors of neutrophil serine proteases. in parallel, activity of ne, pr3 and arginine-specific gingipains (rgps) in gcf was measured. finally loads of p. gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were determined. the highest values of elafin were found in aggressive  periodontitis and the lowest in controls. the quantity of elafin correlated positively with the load of p. gingivalis, ta. forsythia and tr. denticola, as well as with rgps activity. in addition, ne activity was positively associated with the counts of those bacterial species, but not with the amount of elafin. in contrast, the highest concentrations of slpi were found in periodontally healthy  subjects whereas amounts of this inhibitor were significantly decreased in patients infected with p. gingivalis. periodontopathogenic bacteria stimulate the release of ne and pr3, which activities escape the control through degradation of locally produced inhibitors (slpi and elafin) by host-derived and bacteria-derived proteases.

AB  == bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (bos) is a major cause of late graft dysfunction in lung transplant recipients. there is increasing evidence that beside alloimmunologic injury also non-alloimmunologic inflammatory conditions may raise the risk of acute and chronic rejection. the oral cavity represents a possible reservoir for pathogenic bacteria due to its close anatomical proximity. in this pilot study, the presence of pathogenic periodontal bacteria in the oral  cavity as well as in the lungs of lung transplant recipients was investigated for the first time. eight lung transplant recipients underwent broncho-alveolar lavage, transbronchial biopsies, and endobronchial biopsies. in addition to routinely performed examinations, pulmonary as well as plaque samples were assessed for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), tannerella forsythia (tf), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), and treponema denticola (td) with the aid of a hybridization technique. no or only one periodontal pathogen (solitarily pg) was found in the gingival plaques of five of the eight patients (group a). in three patients, two or more periodontal pathogens were detetectable in the gingival samples (group b). whereas group a also had not more than one periodontal pathogen in the lungs, group b had more than one species in the lungs. in group b, all patients suffered from bos, whereas in group a only one patient was affected. this is the first evidence for the presence of periodontal  pathogens in the lungs of lung transplant recipients. further studies with larger cohorts are required to elucidate potential links between periodontal infection,  pulmonary colonization, and rejection.

TI  == predominant bacterial species in subgingival plaque in dogs.
AB  == background and objective: the dog has been used extensively for experimental and  microbiological studies on periodontitis and peri-implantitis without detailed knowledge about the predominant flora of the subgingival plaque. this study was designed to evaluate the predominant cultivable bacterial species in dogs and compare them phenotypically and genotypically with corresponding human species. material and methods: four subgingival samples were taken from two upper premolars in each of six labrador retrievers. the samples from each dog were processed for anaerobic culture. from the samples of each dog, the five or six predominating bacteria based on colony morphology were selected and pure cultured. each of the strains was characterized by gram stain, anaerobic/aerobic  growth and api-zym test. eighteen strains showing clear-cut phenotypic differences were further classified based on dna sequencing technology. cross-reactions of dna probes from human and dog strains were also tested against a panel of both human and dog bacterial species. results: thirty-one strains in the dogs were isolated and characterized. they represented 21 different species,  of which six belonged to the genus porphyromonas. no species was found consistently in the predominant flora of all six dogs. porphyromonas crevioricanis and fusobacterium canifelinum were the two most prevalent species in predominant flora in dogs. dna probes from human and dog species cross-reacted to some extent with related strains from humans and dogs; however, distinct exceptions were found. conclusion: the predominant cultural subgingival flora in  dogs shows great similarities with the subgingival bacteria from humans at the genus level, but distinct differences at the species level; however, a genetic relatedness could be disclosed for most strains investigated.

TI  == [role of several periodontopathogenic microorganisms and tlr4 gene asp299gly polymorphism in atherosclerosis pathogenesis].
AB  == aim: establishment of presence of periodonto-pathogenic microorganisms in atherosclerosis plaque and surrounding tissues, and possible relation of development of atherosclerosis and tlr4 gene asp299gly polymorphism in ischemic heart disease patients (ihd). materials and methods: samples of coronary vessels  obtained during autopsy of 31 individuals deceased from ihd and 5 individuals deceased due to reasons not related with ihd were studied. pcr was used to determine dna of the microorganisms. tlr4 gene polymorphic segment was amplified  by using specific primers. results: analysis of coronary vessel atherosclerotic plaques revealed presence of the studied periodontopathogenic microorganisms in 83.9% of cases. the most frequently detected were porphyromonas gingivalis (64.5%), treponema denticola (41.9%), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (32.3%), less frequently--bacteroides forsythus and prevotella intermedia (12.9%  and 6.5% respectively). in 51.6% of cases 2 or more microorganisms were detected. only in 11.1% ofcoronary artery samples, with plaques containing microorganisms,  the microorganisms were detected in undamaged tissues. patients deceased from ihd had tlr4 gene 299gly allele significantly more frequently. conclusion: the studied periodontopathogenic microorganisms can play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic injury of coronary arteries in ihd. the presence  of tlr4 gene allele 299gly significantly contributes to these processes.

TI  == symptomatic and asymptomatic apical periodontitis associated with red complex bacteria: clinical and microbiological evaluation.
AB  == in this study, the association of red complex (rc) bacteria that include treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia and porphyromonas gingivalis with acute, exacerbated or chronic apical periodontitis was evaluated. seventy-one patients with periapical disease were evaluated by clinical examination and microbiological samples obtained from the root canals were analyzed by a polymerase chain reaction assay. twenty-one (29.6%) samples were positive for rc  bacteria, with t. denticola, t. forsythia and p. gingivalis being detected in 14  (19.7%), 10 (14.1%) and 6 (8.5%) samples, respectively. rc bacteria were mainly associated with acute apical periodontitis (29.2%) and phoenix abscess (63.2%), while they were only sporadically detected (7.1%) in patients with chronic apical periodontitis. generally, rc bacteria were associated with pain and a higher frequency of intracanalar/intrasulcular pus drainage. involvement of rc bacteria  in symptomatic periapical disease should be suspected in the presence of particularly severe clinical pain and pus drainage.

TI  == animal models to study host-bacteria interactions involved in periodontitis.
AB  == animal models have distinct advantages because they can mimic cellular complexities that occur in humans in vivo and are often more accurate than in vitro studies that take place on plastic surfaces with limited numbers of cell types present. furthermore, cause and effect relationships can be established by  applying inhibitors or activators or through the use of genetically modified animals. such gain or loss of function studies are often difficult to achieve in  human clinical studies, particularly in obtaining target tissue due to important  ethical considerations. animal models in periodontal disease are particularly important at this point in the development of the scientific basis for understanding the predominant pathological processes. periodontal disease can be  broken down into discrete steps, each of which may be studied separately depending upon the animal model. these steps involve the development of a pathogenic biofilm, invasion of connective tissue by bacteria or their products,  induction of a destructive host response in connective tissue and limitation of are pair process that follows tissue breakdown. animal studies can test hypotheses related to each of these steps, and should be evaluated by their capacity to test a specific hypothesis rather than recapitulating all aspects of  periodontal disease. thus, each of the models described below can be adapted to test discrete components of the pathological process of periodontal disease, but  not necessarily all of them.

TI  == treatment of residual pockets with photodynamic therapy, diode laser, or deep scaling. a randomized, split-mouth controlled clinical trial.
AB  == the objective of this work was to compare the effects of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (pdt), diode soft laser therapy (dsl), and thorough deep scaling and root planing (srp) for treatment of residual pockets. thirty-two subjects with a history of non-surgical treatment for chronic periodontitis were  included. residual pockets >4 mm and bleeding upon probing were debrided with an  ultrasonic device and then subjected to either pdt, dsl, or srp. pocket probing depth (ppd), bleeding on probing (bop), and gingival recession were monitored over 6 months. counts of four microorganisms were determined by direct hybridization with rna probes. ppd decreased from 5.6 +/- 1.0 to 3.8 +/- 1.1 in 6 months (p < 0.001), and bop decreased from 100% to 52% (p < 0.01). the risk for a site to remain >4 mm with bop depended on initial ppd (p = 0.036) and was higher  if treated with dsl (p = 0.034). frequencies of three microorganisms were significantly lower in pdt- and srp-treated than in dsl-treated quadrants (p = 0.02) after 14 days, but not at months 2 and 6. all three treatments resulted in  a significant clinical improvement. pdt and srp suppressed porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola stronger, and resulted  in fewer persisting pockets after 6 months, than dsl application.

TI  == the effect of spiramycin on porphyromonas gingivalis and other "classic" periopathogens.
AB  == in clinical trials, spiramycin has shown additional benefit overscaling and root  planing on pocket depth reduction, but its effect on periodontal microbiota was evaluated only by darkfield microscopy. therefore, this study was conducted to determine the effect of spiramycin administration on porphyromonas gingivalis and other periodontopathic bacteria using 16s rarn pcr technique. thirty two non-smoker adults with untreated periodontitis and pocket depth > or = 7 mm. were evaluated to participate in this randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial. clinical measurements were performed on day -15, 15, 30 and 90 from baseline. subgingival samples were analyzed for detection of porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythia (tj), treponema denticola (td) and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) on days -15, 30 and 90. on day 0, 25 pg positive subjects were randomly assigned to receive either systemically administered spiramycinfor 7 days (test group sp) or identical placebo tablets (placebo group  pl). after spiramycin administration pg, tf and td were suppressed showingstatistically significant difference (p<0.05) with the placebo group. none of the groups showed changes in aa detection. these data indicate that bacteria currently associated with advanced periodontitis (pg, tf and td) are suppressed after 7 days of systemic administration of spiramycin.

TI  == salivary levels of antibacterial peptide (ll-37/hcap-18) and cotinine in patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between salivary ll-37 levels and clinical severity in patients with chronic periodontitis (cp). the presence/absence of four periodontopathic bacteria and salivary cotinine levels were also examined to assess the impact of these factors on ll-37 production. methods: unstimulated salivary samples were collected from 69 patients with cp. salivary concentrations of ll-37 and cotinine were measured  by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola in saliva were detected by polymerase chain reaction. periodontal examination included determination of probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level, bleeding on probing, and plaque control record. results: mean salivary ll-37 concentration was 225.0 +/- 227.2 ng/ml, and a high prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria was observed. the stepwise ordinal logistic regression model showed that high salivary ll-37 levels were significantly associated with the presence of t. denticola and higher percentage of teeth with pd >/=5 mm. in addition, higher salivary cotinine levels (>/=8 ng/ml) were negatively associated with salivary ll-37 levels. conclusions: salivary ll-37 level was positively correlated with severe periodontal destruction, and production was apparently associated with periodontopathic bacterial infection. the negative correlations between salivary  ll-37 and cotinine levels also suggest that smoking or long-term exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can lead to lower ll-37 levels in the oral cavity and increased risk of periodontitis.

AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to investigate colonisation by periodontopathic bacteria and the sites of colonisation in elderly upper and lower complete denture wearers. we also investigated the relationship between level of oral hygiene and colonisation by periodontopathic bacteria. materials and methods: forty edentulous and 37 dentate volunteers participated in this study. samples were collected from whole saliva, and levels of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia and fusobacterium nucleatum were determined by pcr invader technology. detection of these species on oral mucosal and denture surfaces was performed by pcr. fisher's exact test was used for the statistical analysis. cluster analysis was employed to investigate trends in the periodontopathic bacteria flora in each sampling area. results: detection rates of periodontopathic bacteria in whole saliva were lower under edentulous conditions than under dentulous conditions, except for a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum (p < 0.01). detection rate of f. nucleatum was the highest in all areas. a positive correlation was observed between dna quantification of p. gingivalis and number of candida species in saliva. cluster analysis of the test  species identified two clusters. tongue-coating status was associated with the detection rate of all periodontopathic bacteria investigated, and denture plaque  status was associated with the detection rate of t. denticola and f. nucleatum. conclusion: results indicate the presence of periodontopathic bacteria under edentulous conditions and that the status of oral hygiene of the mucosal or denture surfaces affects colonisation by t. denticola and f. nucleatum.

TI  == detection of periodontal pathogens in newborns and children with mixed dentition.
AB  == we report the age-related prevalence of red complex periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia, along with four strains of orange complex pathogens. the bacteria present in samples isolated from tongue, cheek, and subgingival sulcus in edentulous newborns and children with mixed dentition were monitored by polymerase chain reaction (pcr).  p. gingivalis was not detected in any site of any subject in the two groups tested. however, t. denticola was not only found in the 6-13 years age group, but also in edentulous newborns at a relatively high prevalence, indicating non-dentition-related colonization by t. denticola. campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia, eikenella corrodens, and parvimonas micra were found in the oral cavity of most subjects belonging to the 6-13 years age group compared to newborns. this suggested a pronounced association between these colonizing bacteria and the presence of teeth. there was also a strong relation between t. denticola and t. forsythia for their prevalence in the subgingival sulcus of the 6-13 years age group (p < 0.0001), but not in the other sites tested, suggesting that the colonization of dentition-related t. forsythia may be associated with the increased prevalence of non-dentition-related t. denticola in the subgingival sulcus. overall, these results suggest that dentition is a key determinant of bacterial colonization, especially orange complex bacteria and the red complex bacterium t. forsythia.

TI  == differential detection rate of periodontopathic bacteria in atherosclerosis.
AB  == purpose: periodontitis has been associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular lesions. there may be a link between periodontopathic bacterial infection and atherosclerosis. methods: in 53 patients with atherosclerosis, periodontal disease was classified according to the probing depth of the periodontal pocket.  to compare the detection rate in different arterial lesion, specimens of diseased arteries (10 primary atherosclerotic lesions, 43 anastomotic lesions) and 21 control arteries without atherosclerotic findings macroscopically and microscopically in the arterial wall, obtained during the surgical procedures were examined for the presence of five species of putative periodontal bacteria using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analysis. results: fifty-one of the 53 patients (96%) had periodontitis, and 34 (64%) of those patients had severe periodontitis or were edentulous. in total, pcr analysis detected dna specific for periodontal bacteria in 28 of the 53 specimens (52%) of atherosclerotic arterial wall. only 5 of 21 (23%) were detected in control specimens. conclusions: a high percentage of periodontopathic bacteria were detected in atherosclerotic arterial wall specimens from patients with atherosclerosis, especially with primary atherosclerotic lesions, and most cases had severe periodontitis.

TI  == polymicrobial periodontal pathogen transcriptomes in calvarial bone and soft tissue.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia are consistently associated with adult periodontitis. this study sought to document the host transcriptome to a p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t.forsythia challenge as a polymicrobial infection using a murine calvarial model of acute inflammation and bone resorption. mice were infected with p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia over the calvaria, after which the soft tissues and calvarial bones were excised. a murine genechip((r)) array analysis of transcript profiles showed that 6997 genes were differentially expressed in calvarial bones  (p < 0.05) and 1544 genes were differentially transcribed in the inflamed tissues after the polymicrobial infection. of these genes, 4476 and 1035 genes in the infected bone and tissues were differentially expressed by upregulation. biological pathways significantly impacted by the polymicrobial infection in calvarial bone included leukocyte transendothelial migration (ltm), cell adhesion molecules, adherens junction, major histocompatibility complex antigen, extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, and antigen processing and presentation resulting in inflammatory/cytokine/chemokine transcripts stimulation in bone and soft tissue. intense inflammation and increased activated osteoclasts were observed in calvarias compared with sham-infected controls. quantitative real-time rt-pcr analysis confirmed that the mrna level of selected genes corresponded with the microarray expression. the polymicrobial infection regulated several ltm and extracellular membrane pathway genes in a manner distinct from mono-infection with p. gingivalis, t. denticola, or t. forsythia. to our knowledge, this is the first definition of the polymicrobially induced transcriptome in calvarial bone and soft tissue in response to periodontal pathogens.

TI  == microbiologic changes in subgingival plaque before and during the early period of orthodontic treatment.
AB  == objective: to evaluate changes in subgingival microbiota before and during the leveling and alignment orthodontic stage using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. materials and methods: thirty orthodontic patients (17 females and  13 males; aged 16.7 +/- 6.5 y) were included in this study. subgingival microbial samples were taken from the disto-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper central incisors, the left lower central incisors, the mesio-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper first molars, and the left lower first molars, at four  different times: at baseline, before placement of orthodontic appliances (t1), and 1 week (t2), 3 months (t3), and 6 months after placement of orthodontic appliances (t4). dna was extracted from the samples, and the 16s rrna-based pcr detection method was used to determine the prevalence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, campylobactor rectus, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and treponema denticola, which are considered as putative periodontopathogens. results: the frequency of t forsythia, c rectus, and p nigrescens significantly increased after placement of orthodontic appliances. for the other species, the frequency tended to increase but no statistically significant difference was noted. the frequency of the change, representing microorganisms not existing at t1 but newly developing at t2, t3, and t4, was higher at the molars than at the incisors. conclusion: the placement of orthodontic appliances affects the subgingival microbial composition even during  the early period of orthodontic treatment, increasing the prevalence of periodontopathogens, especially in the molar region.

TI  == detection of periodontal markers in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == the aim was to compare the detection frequency of periodontopathogens by using the pado test 4.5 and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique in chronic periodontitis patients.thirty patients with chronic periodontitis were tested cross-sectionally with dna/rna oligogenomic probe method (iai pado test 4.5) and  dna/dna whole genomic probe (checkerboard) method. samples were taken by two paper points at the deepest site in each of the four quadrants and pooled into one sample for each of the two methods. the samples were sent to the two laboratories (iai, zuchwil, switzerland, and oral microbiology laboratory, university of gothenburg, sweden) and were analyzed in a routine setting for the  presence and amount of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola.while pado test 4.5 detected the four periodontal pathogens in 11 (36.7%) of the patients, the checkerboard method showed presence in all patients (100%) using the lower score  (score 1 corresponding to 10(4) bacterial cells) and 16 (53.3%) using a higher treshold (score 3 corresponding to between >10(5) and 10(6) cells).the results of the present study showed low agreement for a positive microbiological outcome using the two diagnostic methods. it was also concluded that microbiological analysis in practice should include a larger number of bacterial species to better serve as markers for a diseased associated flora in chronic periodontitis  cases.

TI  == clinical and microbiologic results 12 months after scaling and root planing with  different irrigation solutions in patients with moderate chronic periodontitis: a pilot randomized trial.
AB  == background: the aim of this study is to determine in a randomized trial the impact on treatment outcome after 12 months of different subgingival irrigation solutions during scaling and root planing (srp). methods: fifty-one adult volunteers with generalized chronic periodontitis were treated by full-mouth srp  using 0.9% sodium chloride, 0.12% chlorhexidine digluconate, or 7.5% povidone-iodine for subgingival irrigation during srp. before srp and after 3 and 12 months, probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded. subgingival plaque samples were analyzed for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. results: pd, cal, and bop were significantly  improved in all groups after 12 months (p <0.001 to p = 0.044). no significant differences were seen among the groups for all sites and sites with 4 to 6 mm pd  at baseline. the povidone-iodine group had the highest clinical improvements. the counts of a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were significantly reduced after 12 months (p = 0.045 and p = 0.002) using povidone-iodine. significant differences between the groups were seen after 3 months for a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis, and after 12 months for t. forsythia. conclusions: no differences were seen among the groups in the clinical results after 12 months. regarding the microbiologic results, a slight benefit seemed to  derive from the use of povidone-iodine.

TI  == synergistic virulence of porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola in a murine periodontitis model.
AB  == chronic periodontitis is characterized by the destruction of the tissues supporting the teeth and has been associated with the presence of a subgingival polymicrobial biofilm containing porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. we have investigated the potential synergistic virulence of p. gingivalis and t. denticola using a murine experimental model of periodontitis. an inoculation regime of four intra-oral doses of 1 x 10(10) p. gingivalis cells  induced significant periodontal bone loss compared with loss in sham-inoculated mice, whereas doses of 1 x 10(9) cells or lower did not induce bone loss. inoculation with t. denticola with up to eight doses of 1 x 10(10) cells failed to induce bone loss in this model. however, four doses of a co-inoculum of a 1 :  1 ratio of p. gingivalis and t. denticola at 5 x 10(8) or 1 x 10(9) total bacterial cells induced the same level of bone loss as four doses of 1 x 10(10) p. gingivalis cells. co-inoculation induced strong p. gingivalis-specific t-cell  proliferative and interferon-gamma-dominant cytokine responses, and induced a strong t. denticola-specific interferon-gamma dominant cytokine response. only at the higher co-inoculum dose of 1 x 10(10) total cells was a t. denticola-specific t-cell proliferative response observed. these data show that p. gingivalis and t. denticola act synergistically to stimulate the host immune response and to induce alveolar bone loss in a murine experimental periodontitis model.

TI  == clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic factors of orthodontic treatment-induced gingival enlargement.
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to investigate the microbiologic and immunologic factors related to orthodontic treatment-induced gingival enlargement (ge). methods: our study included 12 patients with ge undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment and 12 periodontally healthy controls. at baseline, periodontal variables, subgingival plaque samples, and gingival crevicular fluid  (gcf) samples were taken from 2 preselected sites in both the ge and the control  groups. the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and tannerella  forsythia were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. gcf interleukin (il)-1beta and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (tgf-beta1) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (invitrogen, camarillo, calif). periodontal therapy was given to the ge group, and all parameters were reassessed after 4 weeks. results: at baseline, the ge group showed higher prevalences of the 5 periodontal pathogens than did the control group (p <0.05). il-1beta and tgf-beta1 levels at the ge sites were also significantly higher than those at the control sites (p <0.05). four weeks after periodontal therapy, the ge group showed significant improvements in the clinical parameters associated with significant reductions of p gingivalis, a actinomycetemcomitans, and t denticola. the levels of il-1beta decreased significantly compared with the baseline (p <0.05), whereas there was no significant change in tgf-beta1 levels (p >0.05). conclusions: periodontal pathogens might have a relationship with the initiation  and development of orthodontic treatment-induced ge. inflammatory cytokines (il-1beta and tgf-beta1) can also be considered as contributing factors.

TI  == [prevalence of helicobacter pylori detected by real-time pcr in the subgingival plaque of patients with chronic periodontitis].
AB  == background: helicobacter pylori plays a significant role in gastric disease. the  aim of the present pilot study was to evaluate the prevalence of h. pylori detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time pcr) in the sub-gingival plaque of chronic periodontitis patients and to determine periodontopathogens profile of positive sites at h. pylori. methodology: 109 subgingival samples collected from 17 subjects with chronic periodontitis were studied. the dna was extracted from the oral samples and analyzed for the presence of h. pylori by real-time pcr (lightcycler) using 16s rrna#120 primers which targeted the 16s rrna gene. dna from h. pylori dsm 4867 was used as a positive control. seven bacteria implicated in chronic periodontitis were selected to explore the presence of these periodontopathic species in the oral positive sites for h. pylori. results: 16 of 109 samples (14.7%) were positives of h. pylori. all the positives sites were also positives to fusobacterium nucleatum and eikenella corrodens, 62.5% to porphyromonas gingivalis, 31.25% to treponema denticola, 25% to prevotella intermedia, 12.5% to aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and 6.25% to tannerella forsythia. conclusions: h. pylori may be present in the subgingival plaque samples of patients with chronic periodontitis who are resident in a developing country. f. nucleatum and e. corrodens could coaggregate with h. pylori in the subgingival dental plaque.

TI  == the evaluation of bacterial flora in progress of peri-implant disease.
AB  == background: cumulative interceptive supportive therapy (cist) is currently used as a guideline for treating peri-implant diseases. the objectives of this study were to determine the detection rate and measure the number of periodontopathic bacteria in lesions of different cist levels and thereby characterize peri-implant disease from a bacteriological viewpoint. methods: this study included 105 patients who had both residual natural teeth and implants with peri-implant disease. a total of 105 implants were divided into levels a, b, c and d according to the cist classification. bacterial samples were collected from peri-implant pockets and four periodontopathic bacteria were measured by pcr and  pcr-invader assay. results: the number of periodontopathic bacteria increased in  line with cist level, and the detection rate was also associated with cist level. however, no difference was found in the bacterial detection rate of p. gingivalis and t. denticola between cist-b and cist-c. there was a higher detection rate of  all periodontopathic bacteria for cist-d. conclusions: the number of periodontopathic bacteria and detection rate increased as peri-implant disease advanced. however, there were no major differences in the detection rate between  cist-b and cist-c. on the other hand, a higher detection rate of periodontopathic bacteria was seen for cist-d.

TI  == identification of periodontal pathogens in healthy periimplant sites.
AB  == purpose: : the aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of periodontopathogens in subgingival periimplant sites in partially edentulous patients using polymerase chain reaction procedures, with regard to areas with clinical and radiographic signs of health and areas presenting periimplant disease. materials and methods: : thirty nonsmoking, partially edentulous patients, aged 30 to 76 years, were included in this study and divided in 3 groups according their clinical and radiographic characteristics. group a (n = 10) presented periimplant health, group b (n = 10) presented periimplant mucositis, and group c (n = 10) were patients with periimplantitis. periimplant tissues were clinically examined as regards the color of mucosae, presence of bacterial plaque, depth and bleeding on probing, and local suppuration. history of periodontal disease was also considered. radiographic analysis evaluated the presence of bone loss around the implant. samples of periimplant crevicular fluid were collected to analyze the presence of periodontal pathogens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia  (pi), tannerella forsythensis (tf), and treponema denticola (td). results: : the  results showed that the history of periodontal disease is associated with periimplant disease. the bacteria aa, pg, pi, td, and tf were present in periimplant sites clinically and radiographically characterized, as healthy periimplant tissues, mucositis, and periimplantitis. conclusions: : we concluded  that aa, pg, pi, td, and tf are present in healthy and diseased conditions. therefore, these periodontal pathogens are not strictly related to periimplant disease sites.

TI  == effect of periodontopathogen lipopolysaccharides and proinflammatory cytokines on cd46, cd55, and cd59 gene/protein expression by oral epithelial cells.
AB  == membrane-anchored complement regulatory proteins (crps), including cd46, cd55, and cd59, protect host cells from complement attack. in the present study, we investigated whether periodontopathogen lipopolysaccharide and proinflammatory cytokines modulate crp gene/protein expression in human oral epithelial cells. the lipopolysaccharide of treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia were the most potent for increasing the gene expression of cd55 and cd59, and to a lesser  extent cd46, after a 48-h stimulation. an lipopolysaccharide-induced upregulation of epithelial cell-surface crp was also demonstrated. the stimulation of epithelial cells with lipopolysaccharide was associated with interleukin-6 (il-6) and il-8 secretion. although these two cytokines had no effect on cd46 and cd55 gene expression in epithelial cells, il-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha induced a significant upregulation. the cell-surface expression of crp was also increased by the stimulation of epithelial cells with cytokines. the cd46, cd55,  and cd59 gene/protein expression was upregulated by periodontopathogen lipopolysaccharide and proinflammatory cytokines. it can be hypothesized that, when faced with bacterial challenges and inflammatory conditions associated with  active periodontal sites, oral epithelial cells may respond by increasing crp gene/protein expression to avoid cell lysis by the complement system, which is activated during periodontitis.

TI  == inhibition of host- and bacteria-derived proteinases by natural anthocyanins.
AB  == background and objectives: host- and bacteria-derived proteinases are considered  to play critical roles in periodontitis progression. this study investigated the  ability of a blackcurrant extract and its major anthocyanins (cyanidin-3-o-glucoside, cyanidin-3-o-rutinoside and delphinidin-3-o-rutinoside)  to inhibit the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (mmps), neutrophil elastase  and periodontopathogen (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) proteinases. material and methods: enzyme inhibition was detected using fluorometric and colorimetric assays after incubating blackcurrant extract and its major anthocyanins (at concentrations of 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50 mug/ml) with mmps, elastase or bacterial proteinases, along with their specific substrates. substrate degradation was recorded every hour for up to 4 h. results: the blackcurrant extract (50 mug/ml) inhibited all proteinases tested. mmp-1 and  mmp-9 were significantly inhibited by pure anthocyanins at concentrations ranging from 6.25 to 50 mug/ml. elastase activity was inhibited by cyanidin-3-o-glucoside and cyanidin-3-o-rutinoside in the range of 6.25-50 mug/ml and by delphinidin-3-o-rutinoside at 50 mug/ml. p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and t. denticola proteinases were also significantly inhibited by pure anthocyanins. in  all cases, enzyme inhibition was time-dependent. conclusion: our study showed that a blackcurrant extract and its major anthocyanins were able to inhibit the activity of host- and bacteria-derived proteinases. this suggests that such natural compounds may represent promising agents for use in adjunctive treatments for periodontitis.

TI  == viral-bacterial associations in acute apical abscesses.
AB  == objective: viral-bacterial and bacterial synergism have been suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of several human diseases. this study sought to investigate the possible associations between 9 candidate endodontic bacterial pathogens and 9 human viruses in samples from acute apical abscesses. study design: dna extracts from purulent exudate aspirates of 33 cases of acute apical  abscess were surveyed for the presence of 9 selected bacterial species using a 16s ribosomal rna gene-based nested polymerase chain reaction (pcr) approach. single or nested pcr assays were used for detection of the human papillomavirus (hpv) and herpesviruses types 1 to 8. results: two-thirds of the abscess samples  were positive for at least one of the target viruses. specifically, the most frequently detected viruses were hhv-8 (54.5%); hpv (9%); and varicella zoster virus (vzv), epstein-barr virus (ebv), and hhv-6 (6%). bacterial dna was present  in all cases and the most prevalent bacterial species were treponema denticola (70%), tannerella forsythia (67%), porphyromonas endodontalis (67%), dialister invisus (61%), and dialister pneumosintes (57.5%). hhv-8 was positively associated with 7 of the target bacterial species and hpv with 4, but all these associations were weak. several bacterial pairs showed a moderate positive association. viral coinfection was found in 6 abscess cases, but no significant viral association could be determined. conclusions: findings demonstrated that bacterial and viral dna occurred concomitantly in two-thirds of the samples from  endodontic abscesses. although this may suggest a role for viruses in the etiology of apical abscesses, the possibility also exists that the presence of viruses in abscess samples is merely a consequence of the bacterially induced disease process. further studies are necessary to clarify the role of these viral-bacterial interactions, if any, in the pathogenesis of acute apical abscesses.

TI  == microbial shifts during dental biofilm re-development in the absence of oral hygiene in periodontal health and disease.
AB  == aim: to monitor microbial shifts during dental biofilm re-development. materials  and methods: supra- and subgingival plaque samples were taken separately from 28  teeth in 38 healthy and 17 periodontitis subjects at baseline and immediately after tooth cleaning. samples were taken again from seven teeth in randomly selected quadrants during 1, 2, 4 and 7 days of no oral hygiene. samples were analysed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. species counts were averaged within subjects at each time point. significant differences in the counts between healthy and periodontitis subjects were determined using the mann-whitney test. results: the total supra- and subgingival counts were significantly higher in periodontitis on entry and reached or exceeded the baseline values after day 2. supragingival counts of veillonella parvula, fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii and neisseria mucosa increased from 2 to 7 days. subgingival counts were greater  for actinomyces, green and orange complex species. significant differences between groups in supragingival counts occurred for 17 of 41 species at entry, 0  at day 7; for subgingival plaque, these values were 39/41 taxa at entry, 17/41 at day 7. conclusions: supragingival plaque re-development was similar in periodontitis and health, but subgingival species recolonization was more marked  in periodontitis.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

TI  == association of red complex, a. actinomycetemcomitans and non-oral bacteria with periodontal diseases.
AB  == objective: pathogens related to systemic infections have been detected in the periodontal microbiota. the relationship amongst these pathogens, periodontal bacteria and periodontal clinical status is poorly understood. this study evaluated the association amongst red complex, a. actinomycetemcomitans (a.a) and non-oral pathogenic bacteria in subjects with good periodontal health (ph), gingivitis (g), chronic (cp) and aggressive (ap) periodontitis. methods: subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 51 ph, 42 g, 219 cp and 90 ap subjects. the presence and levels of a.a, red complex (porphyromonas gingivalis,  tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola), acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia  coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus were determined by dna probes and dna-dna hybridization technique. results: cp and ap subjects presented significantly higher prevalence and levels of a.a, red  complex and a. baumannii than g and ph individuals (p<0.01), whereas s. aureus was detected in lower frequency and counts in ap as compared to the other groups  (p<0.001). the predictor variables age, prevalence of red complex, and the presence of a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa were strongly associated with the frequency of sites with pd and cal >/=5 mm. increasing age (or 1.08), high frequency of red complex (or 6.10), and the presence of a.a with p. aeruginosa (or 1.90) were associated with periodontal disease (p<0.001). subjects harbouring a high prevalence of a.a, a. baumannii, and red complex with p. aeruginosa were more likely to have ap than cp (p<0.001). conclusion: putative periodontal pathogens and non-oral bacteria alone or in association were strongly associated  with periodontitis.

TI  == relationship between the beta-galactosidase activity in saliva and parameters associated with oral malodor.
AB  == volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) are produced by enzymes capable of transforming  s-amino acids to corresponding sulfides. protein degradation by periodontopathogens plays an important role in this process, and the proteolysis  of glycoproteins depends on the initial removal of the carbohydrate side chains.  in the present report, we tested the relationship between the beta-galactosidase  activity in saliva and parameters that influence oral malodor, including daily habits and oral conditions. the prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria was also  examined. forty-nine saliva samples were collected from halitosis patients. patients were examined for breath odor and other associated parameters. their breath odor was assessed using an organoleptic test, a portable sulfide monitor and gas chromatography. the presence of periodontopathic bacteria in the saliva was also examined. beta-galactosidase activity was measured with the chromogenic  substrates 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside and isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside. beta-galactosidase activity was positively correlated with malodor strength (organoleptic score, portable sulfide monitor score and vsc concentrations). enzyme activity was also correlated with the degree of observable tongue coating. however, it showed no relationship with  periodontal condition, saliva flow, tooth decay, unfitted restorations or the color of any tongue coating. while there was no relationship with porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola, there was a negative correlation with prevotella intermedia. these results indicate that beta-galactosidase activity plays an important role in malodor production. interestingly, the activity of this enzyme was not related to the presence of periodontopathic bacteria, which are the main malodor-producing organisms. the results obtained here may have been associated with physiologic halitosis, which is not necessarily associated with oral problems or with periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == myrsinoic acid b inhibits the production of hydrogen sulfide by periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  == recently, we reported that myrsinoic acid b purified from myrsine seguinii inhibited methyl mercaptan (ch(3)sh) production by fusobacterium nucleatum jcm8532. since hydrogen sulfide (h(2)s) is the main component of physiological halitosis, while ch(3)sh is involved in pathological oral halitosis, the objective of this study is to determine whether myrsinoic acid b inhibits h(2)s production by oral microorganisms. f. nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola were incubated with myrsinoic acid b and a substrate such as  l-cysteine or l-methionine. h(2)s or ch(3)sh concentration in the headspace air,  was determined using a gas chromatograph. the concentration of myrsinoic acid b inhibiting 50% (ic(50)) of h(2)s production by f. nucleatum was 0.142 microg ml(-1), and the ic(50) of p. gingivalis and t. denticola were 2.71 microg ml(-1)  and 28.9 microg ml(-1), respectively. the presence of pyruvate, a by-product of h(2)s production, was determined. the ic(50) values of myrsinoic acid b for pyruvate production were 22.9 microg ml(-1) for f. nucleatum, 87.7 microg ml(-1)  for p. gingivalis and 165 microg ml(-1) for t. denticola. we concluded that myrsinoic acid b inhibited the production of both h(2)s and pyruvate by periodontal pathogens.

AB  == the aim of our study was to investigate how teenage smoking affects the prevalence of periodontal bacteria and periodontal health with the hypothesis that smoking increases the prevalence of the bacteria. oral health of 264 adolescents (15- to 16-year-olds) was clinically examined, and their smoking history was recorded. the participants also filled in a structured questionnaire  recording their general health and health habits. pooled subgingival plaque samples were taken for polymerase chain reaction analysis of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and treponema denticola. the prevalence of p.  intermedia (21% vs. 4%, p = 0.01) and t. forsythia and t. denticola (23% vs. 8%,  p < 0.05, for both) was higher among female smokers than among non-smokers. t. forsythia and t. denticola were more often associated with bleeding on probing (29% vs. 12%; 25% vs. 10%, respectively) and deep pockets (25% vs. 15%; 23% vs. 10%, respectively) with smokers than non-smokers. among the girls, a significant  association was found between pack-years and the prevalence of p. nigrescens (p < 0.007). in both genders, a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were rare in  this study. to conclude, periodontal bacteria were associated with higher periodontal index scores among all teenage smokers. smoking girls harbored more frequently certain periodontal bacteria than non-smokers, but this was not seen in boys. hence, our study hypothesis was only partly confirmed.

TI  == effect of non-surgical treatment on chronic and aggressive periodontitis: clinical, immunologic, and microbiologic findings.
AB  == background: our goal was to examine differences in clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic responses to non-surgical mechanical therapy in patients with generalized chronic periodontitis (gcp) and generalized aggressive periodontitis  (gagp). methods: twenty patients with gcp and 14 patients with gagp were evaluated. clinical data, gingival crevicular fluid (gcf), and subgingival plaque samples were collected at baseline and 3 months after non-surgical periodontal treatment. levels of 40 subgingival species were measured using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. gcf interleukin (il)-1beta, -4, and -8 and interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) were analyzed using a multiplexed bead immunoassay,  and elastase activity was measured using an enzymatic assay. the significance of  changes with time was examined using the wilcoxon rank sum test. changes in clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic parameters after therapy were compared between groups using the mann-whitney u test. results: after periodontal therapy, we found significant improvements for all clinical parameters in both groups. we  also observed significant reductions in elastase activity in shallow and deep sites from the gagp group and in deep sites from the gcp group. microbiologic data showed significant reductions in proportions of orange and red complexes and an increase in proportions of actinomyces species in both clinical groups. when the clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic responses after therapy were compared between groups, only minor differences were found. conclusion: this study fails to show any significant differences between severe forms of gcp and gagp in response to non-surgical periodontal treatment.

TI  == polymicrobial infection with periodontal pathogens specifically enhances microrna mir-146a in apoe-/- mice during experimental periodontal disease.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia are periodontal pathogens associated with the etiology of adult periodontitis as polymicrobial infections. recent studies demonstrated that oral infection with p. gingivalis induces both periodontal disease and atherosclerosis in hyperlipidemic and proatherogenic apoe(-/-) mice. in this study, we explored the expression of micrornas (mirnas) in maxillas (periodontium) and spleens isolated from apoe(-/-) mice infected with p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia as a polymicrobial infection. mirna expression levels, including mirna mir-146a, and associated mrna expression levels of the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (il-1beta) were measured in the maxillas and spleens from mice infected with periodontal pathogens and compared to those in the maxillas and spleens from sham-infected controls. furthermore, in response to these periodontal pathogens (as mono- and polymicrobial heat-killed and live bacteria), human thp-1 monocytes demonstrated similar mirna expression patterns, including that of mir-146a, in vitro. strikingly, mir-146a had a negative correlation with tnf-alpha secretion in vitro, reducing levels of the adaptor kinases il-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (irak-1) and tnf receptor-associated factor 6 (traf6). thus, our studies revealed a persistent association of mir-146a expression with these periodontal pathogens, suggesting that mir-146a may directly or indirectly modulate or alter the chronic periodontal pathology induced by these microorganisms.

TI  == molecular survey of atheromatous plaques for the presence of dna from periodontal bacterial pathogens, archaea and fungi.
AB  == background and objective: chronic infections, such as periodontitis, have been associated with the development and progression of atherosclerosis. the mechanisms through which this occurs have yet to be elucidated. this study was carried out to detect periodontopathic bacteria as well as archaea and fungi in atheromatous plaques and search for factors associated with their occurrence in atheromas. material and methods: a cross-sectional study was carried out including 30 patients diagnosed with atherosclerosis in the carotid, coronary or  femoral arteries. plaques were collected during surgery and analysed using pcr to detect aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and members of the synergistetes group. samples were also surveyed with universal primers for bacterial, archaeal and fungal dna. patients responded to a questionnaire to determine factors associated with pcr results. results: all dentate individuals (66.7%) had periodontal disease, 95% of which was severe and  65% extensive. none of the targeted periodontopathic bacteria was found in the atheromas. no sample yielded positive results for fungal and archaeal dna. four samples (13%) were positive for the presence of bacterial dna. of these, three participants were dentate (two with severely chronic generalized periodontitis and one with severely chronic localized periodontitis). conclusion: this study did not confirm previous findings of periodontal pathogens in atheromas, making it impossible to establish factors associated with their presence in plaques. presence of bacterial dna in some samples indicates that periodontal or nonoral bacterial species other than the ones targeted in this study may be involved with some cases of atherosclerosis.

TI  == prognosis of periodontitis recurrence after intensive periodontal treatment using examination of serum igg antibody titer against periodontal bacteria.
AB  == chronic periodontitis is associated with systemic diseases such as atherosclerosis. in this study, we evaluated the efficacy of serum igg antibody titer to periodontal bacteria for prognosis of periodontitis recurrence during supportive periodontal therapy (spt) phase. the 139 patients during spt phase were selected and divided to two groups as follows: "stable" and "recurrence" group at spt phase for case-control study: "high igg titer" and "normal igg titer" group before transition to spt phase for cohort study. we examined whether clinical findings or serum igg antibody titers to periodontal bacteria are risk factors for the development of periodontitis recurrence. case-control study showed that there were significant differences between the stable and recurrence  groups in age and number of teeth. the serum igg antibody titer to eikenella corrodens fdc1073, porphyromonas gingivalis su63, and campylobacter rectus atcc33238 was significantly higher in the recurrence group. next, we found, that  the recurrence ratio in the high igg titer group to gram-negative obligate anaerobe, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and c. rectus was significantly higher than that of the normal igg titer group. taken together, serum igg antibody titer test is useful in the prognosis of periodontitis recurrence during the spt phase.

TI  == identification of periodontal pathogens and severity of periodontitis in patients with and without chronic kidney disease.
AB  == objective: in this study of patients with chronic periodontitis (cp), the severity of the disease and the main periodontal pathogens identified in patients with chronic kidney disease (ckd) were compared with those detected in individuals without systemic disease. design: nineteen patients with cp without evidence of systemic disease (control group), 25 patients with cp and ckd who were in the pre-dialysis stages (pre-dialysis group), and 22 patients with cp and ckd who were on renal replacement therapy (rrt group) were examined. the severity of cp was based on the investigation of probing depth (pd) and clinical attachment level (cal). the definition and stage of ckd were based on the criteria proposed by the kidney disease outcomes quality initiative of the national kidney foundation. glomerular filtration rate (gfr) was estimated using  the equation of modification of diet in renal disease and the identification of microorganisms in subgingival plaque was performed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: candida albicans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were more common in patients who were on rrt and pre-dialysis than in control subjects. cp was more severe in patients with ckd. a strong association was observed between the frequency of c. albicans (p =  0.056), p.gingivalis (p = 0.008), t. denticola (p = 0.013) and cal, when ckd patients were compared with the control group. conclusion: cp is more severe and  is associated with increased frequency of c. albicans, p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola in patients with ckd.

TI  == effect of smoking on subgingival microflora of patients with periodontitis in japan.
AB  == background: smoking is a risk factor for periodontitis. to clarify the contribution of smoking to periodontitis, it is essential to assess the relationship between smoking and the subgingival microflora. the aim of this study was to gain an insight into the influence of smoking on the microflora of japanese patients with periodontitis. methods: sixty-seven japanese patients with chronic periodontitis (19 to 83 years old, 23 women and 44 men) were enrolled in  the present study. they consisted of 30 smokers and 37 non-smokers. periodontal parameters including probing pocket depth (ppd) and bleeding on probing (bop) and oral hygiene status were recorded. detection of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum, treponema denticola  and campylobacter rectus in subgingival plaque samples was performed by polymerase chain reaction. association between the detection of periodontopathic  bacteria and smoking status was analyzed by multiple logistic regression analysis and chi-square test. results: a statistically significant association was found between having a ppd >/= 4 mm and detection of t. denticola, p. intermedia, t. forsythia, or c. rectus, with odds ratios ranging from 2.17 to 3.54. a significant association was noted between bop and the detection of c. rectus or p. intermedia, and smoking, with odds ratios ranging from 1.99 to 5.62. prevalence of c. rectus was higher in smokers than non-smokers, whereas that of a. actinomycetemcomitans was lower in smokers. conclusions: within limits, the analysis of the subgingival microbial flora in smokers and non-smokers with chronic periodontitis suggests a relevant association between smoking and colonization by the specific periodontal pathogens including c. rectus.

TI  == use of quantitative pcr to evaluate methods of bacteria sampling in periodontal patients.
AB  == periodontal disease is associated with specific periodontal pathogens and may persist as gingivitis or progress to more severe disease. the bacteria involved in disease initiation and progression have not been identified. we used quantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to compare the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola, and total bacteria detected by different sampling methods. on the basis of the results of clinical examinations, 57 patients were divided into 3 groups: healthy group (group a), gingivitis group (group b), and periodontitis group (group c). bacterial samples were collected from saliva, mouthwash, and by paper-point sampling of gingival crevicular fluid (gcf), and the samples were analyzed with quantitative pcr targeting 16s rrna. the numbers of total bacteria in samples of  gcf, saliva, and mouthwash were 10(5) to 10(6), 10(8), and 10(7), respectively, per milliliter. the number of p. gingivalis in gcf samples was lower than 10 in group a; however, in groups b and c, the values were 10(3) and 10(4), respectively, indicating that the number of p. gingivalis increased with worsening clinical status. findings were similar in the samples of saliva and mouthwash. the numbers of t. forsythia showed a pattern similar to that of p. gingivalis in all 3 samples. these results suggest that saliva and mouthwash samples are clinically useful for bacterial testing of periodontal diseases by quantitative pcr. in addition, mouthwash sampling is more feasible and straightforward than saliva sampling.

TI  == [detection of putative periodontal pathogens of periodontitis with type 2 diabetes].
AB  == objective: to detect the putative periodontal pathogens in the subgingival plaque of chronic periodontitis (cp) patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (dm) and to  discuss the role of the periodontal pathogens in the cp and type 2 dm patients. methods: the study included 154 cp patients with type 2 dm (dm graup), one hundred and twenty subjects with cp (cp group) and 40 healthy subjects. subgingival plaque samples were obtained with sterile subgingival curettes and pathogens genomic dna were extracted by phenol and chloroform from plaque. taking porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), prevotella intermedia (pi), tannerella forsythia (tf) and treponema denticola (td) as aim pathogens, polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method was used to determine the prevalence of pg, aa, fn, pi, tf and td in the subgingival plaque samples. results: pg, aa, fn, pi, tf and td were all found in the subgingival plaque of dm group. in serious periodontitis, the detection rate of pg, aa and tf in dm group [pg: 78% (72/92), aa: 27% (25/92), tf: 67% (62/92)] was significantly higher than in the cp group [pg: 58% (35/60), aa: 17%  (10/60), tf: 43% (26/60)], p < 0.05. in slight periodontitis, the detection rate  of pi in dm group was significantly lower than in the cp group. at the same time, the average gradation (avg) ratio of pcr product of aa and tf in dm group was significantly higher than in the cp group and the avg ratio of pi in dm group was significantly lower than in the cp group (p < 0.05). conclusions: compared with the pure cp, the quantity of pg, aa and tf in the subgingival plaque of the periodontitis patients with type 2 dm increased, but the pi quantity reduced.

TI  == comparison of real-time polymerase chain reaction and dna-strip technology in microbiological evaluation of periodontitis treatment.
AB  == the impact of a semiquantitative commercially available test based on dna-strip technology (microident(r), hain lifescience, nehren, germany) on diagnosis and treatment of severe chronic periodontitis of 25 periodontitis patients was evaluated in comparison with a quantitative in-house real-time pcr. subgingival plaque samples were collected at baseline as well as at 3, 6, and 12 months later. after extracting dna, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and several other periodontopathogens were determined by both methods. the results obtained by dna-strip technology were analyzed semiquantitatively and additionally quantitatively by densitometry. the results for the 4 major periodontopathogenic  bacterial species correlated significantly between the 2 methods. samples detecting a high bacterial load by one method and negative by the other were always found in less than 2% of the total samples. both technologies showed the impact of treatment on microflora. especially the semiquantitative dna-strip technology clearly analyzed the different loads of periodontopathogens after therapy and is useful in microbial diagnostics for patients in dental practices.

TI  == serum cytokine levels in periodontitis patients in relation to the bacterial load.
AB  == background: periodontitis is a local inflammatory disease that also has some systemic effects. we investigated the levels of interferon (ifn)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, and interleukin (il)-2, -4, -5, and -10 in the serum of patients with periodontitis in relation to the bacterial load in the dental plaques. methods: serum cytokine levels in patients with generalized periodontitis and healthy control groups were determined using the cytometric bead array kit. bacterial load in the dental plaque was determined semiquantitatively by real-time polymerase chain reaction. the proportions of different lymphocyte subsets were determined in the peripheral blood of patients  with periodontitis by flow cytometry. finally, relationships between the bacterial load in the subgingival plaques of patients with periodontitis and levels of cytokines and counts of lymphocyte subsets were established. results: serum levels of ifn-gamma, tnf-alpha, and il-10 were significantly increased, whereas those of il-2 were significantly decreased in patients with periodontitis compared to healthy controls. increased serum levels of ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha in patients with periodontitis were associated with the enhanced dental plaque load with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) and porphyromonas gingivalis, respectively. finally, as revealed by analysis of lymphocyte populations, the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans and trepomena denticola was associated with an increased population of cd3(-)/cd16(+) and cd3(+)/cd8(+) cells, respectively. conclusion: certain periodontal pathogens could be associated with an increased level of proinflammatory cytokines in the peripheral blood and thus increased risk of systemic diseases.

TI  == periodontal pathogens interfere with quorum-sensing-dependent virulence properties in streptococcus mutans.
AB  == background and objective: the mechanism by which periodontal pathogens dominate at disease sites is not yet understood. one possibility is that these late colonizers antagonize the quorum-sensing systems of early colonizers and render those early colonizers less resistant to environmental factors. in this study, we utilized streptococcus mutans, a well-documented oral streptococcus with many quorum-sensing-dependent properties, as an example of an earlier colonizer antagonized by periodontal pathogens. material and methods: in this study, s. mutans ng8 and s. mutans lt11 were used in experiments assessing transformation,  and s. mutans bm71 was used in experiments investigating bacteriocin production.  the effects of the periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola on these competence-stimulating peptide-dependent properties were evaluated in mixed-broth assays. results: both p. gingivalis (either live bacteria or membrane vesicles) and t. denticola antagonized transformation in s.  mutans ng8 and lt11. the production of bacteriocin by s. mutans bm71 was also inhibited by p. gingivalis and t. denticola. boiling of these late colonizers before addition to the broth cultures abolished their ability to inhibit s. mutans transformation and bacteriocin production. p. gingivalis and t. denticola  inactivated s. mutans exogenous competence-stimulating peptide, whereas the boiled bacteria did not. conclusions: this study demonstrated that periodontal pathogens antagonize s. mutans quorum-sensing properties. this may render s. mutans less virulent and less resistant to environmental antibacterial factors.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a single application of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt) on microbiological profile and cytokine pattern in dogs. periodontal disease was induced by placing 3.0 silk ligatures around the mandibular pre-molars bilaterally during 8 weeks. the dogs were randomly treated with apdt using a dye/laser system, scaling and root planning (srp), or with the association of treatments (srp + apdt). plaque samples were collected at baseline, 1, 3, and 4 weeks, and the mean counts of 40 species were  determined using dna-dna hybridization. gingival biopsies were removed and the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), receptor activator of nf-kb ligand (rankl), osteoprotegerin (opg), matrix metalloproteinase (mmp-1), interleukin (il) 6, il-10 and total bacterial load by analysis of 16 s rrna gene  were evaluated through real-time pcr. the results shows that the levels of the majority of the species were reduced 1 week post-therapy for all treatments, however, an increase in counts of prevotella intermedia (p = 0.00), prevotella. nigrescens (p = 0.00) and tannerella forsythia (p = 0.00) was observed for apdt and srp + apdt. after 4 weeks, a regrowth of porphyromonas gingivalis (p = 0.00)  and treponema denticola (p = 0.00), was observed for all treatments. also, a strikingly reduction of counts on counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was observed for the apdt (p = 0.00). for the cytokine pattern, the results were  similar for all treatments, and a reduction in the expression of cytokines and bacterial load was observed throughout the study. our results suggest that srp, apdt in a single application, and srp + apdt affects different bacterial species  and have similar effects on the expression of cytokines evaluated during the treatment of ligature-induced periodontitis.

TI  == hemagglutinin/adhesin domains of porphyromonas gingivalis play key roles in coaggregation with treponema denticola.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola are major pathogens of periodontal disease. coaggregation between microorganisms plays a key role in the colonization of the gingival crevice and the organization of periodontopathic biofilms. we investigated the involvement of surface ligands of p. gingivalis in  coaggregation. two triple mutants of p. gingivalis lacking arg-gingipain a (rgpa), lys-gingipain (kgp) and hemagglutinin a (haga) or rgpa, arg-gingipain b (rgpb) and kgp showed significantly decreased coaggregation with t. denticola, whereas coaggregation with a major fimbriae (fima)-deficient mutant was the same  as that with the p. gingivalis wild-type parent strain. rgpa, kgp and haga code for proteins that contain 44 kda hgp44 adhesin domains. the coaggregation activity of an rgpa kgp mutant was significantly higher than that of the rgpa kgp haga mutant. furthermore, anti-hgp44 immunoglobulin g reduced coaggregation between p. gingivalis wild type and t. denticola. treponema denticola sonicates adhered to recombinant rgp domains. coaggregation following co-culture of the rgpa kgp haga mutant expressing the rgpb protease with the rgpa rgpb kgp mutant expressing the unprocessed haga protein was enhanced compared with that of each triple mutant with t. denticola. these results indicate that the processed p. gingivalis surface hgp44 domains are key adhesion factors for coaggregation with  t. denticola.

AB  == periodontopathic bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, campylobacter rectus and treponema denticola play an important role in the initiation and progression of periodontitis. the aim of this investigation was to evaluate the relationship between periodontal clinical parameters and the subgingival profile of periodontopathic bacteria. twenty-six periodontitis patients (23-62 years of age; mean age, 40.2+/-13.2) with no systemic disease agreed to participate in the study. periodontal clinical parameters, including probing depth (pd) and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from deep (pd>/=4 mm) and shallow (pd</=3 mm) pockets in each patient for detection of p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, t. forsythia, c. rectus and t. denticola by polymerase chain reaction technique. the relationship between the periodontal  pathogens and clinical parameters was determined with the fisher exact test, and  a statistically significant association was found between detection of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, c. rectus and t. denticola and pd or bop. t. denticola  was the most prevalent pathogen in both shallow pd and deep pd sites. no statistically significant association was found between detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans and the clinical parameters examined. a statistically significant association was found between detection of the red complex bacteria and the clinical parameters. these results suggest that the red complex pathogens and c. rectus play an important role in the initiation and progression of periodontitis.

TI  == il6 -174 genotype associated with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in indians.
AB  == aim: genetic factors have recently been associated with presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans subgingivally in populations living in industrialized countries. the aim of this study was to analyse associations between interleukin-6 (il6) single nucleotide polymorphisms and presence and levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans and other subgingival microbes in a rural indian population. subjects and methods: a total of 251 individuals from a rural  village in india with a periodontal phenotype ranging from healthy to severe periodontitis were included. checkerboard dna-dna analysis was performed to detect 40 periodontal taxa in subgingival plaque samples. genomic dna was extracted to genotype five polymorphisms in the il6 promoter region. results: the il6-74 gg genotype was associated with high (above median) counts of a. actinomycetemcomitans (both in all subjects and in periodontally healthy only) and with presence and counts of capnocytophaga sputigena. differences in detection of several other bacteria were noted between periodontitis and healthy  subjects. conclusions: these findings support the influence of genetic factors on the subgingival microbiota.

TI  == periodontal parameters and bana test in patients with chronic renal failure undergoing hemodialysis.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to analyze the periodontal parameters of patients with chronic renal failure. material and methods: the periodontal status of 16 brazilian patients aged 29 to 53 (41.7 +/- 7.2) years with chronic renal failure (crf) and another matched group of 14 healthy controls with periodontitis was assessed clinically and microbiologically. probing pocket depth (ppd), gingival recession (gr), dental plaque index (pli), gingival index (gi), and dental calculus index (ci) were the clinical parameters recorded for the entire dentition (at least 19 teeth), while the anaerobic periodontopathogen colonization in four sites with the highest ppd was evaluated using the bana test ("perioscan"; oral b). results: the results for the crf group and control group,  respectively were: ppd: 1.77 +/- 0.32 and 2.65 +/- 0.53; gr: 0.58 +/- 0.56 and 0.51 +/- 0.36; pli: 1.64 +/- 0.56 and 1.24 +/- 0.67; gi: 0.64 +/- 0.42 and 0.93 +/- 0.50; ci: 1.17 +/- 0.54 and 0.87 +/- 0.52. comparison between groups using the "t" test revealed a significantly increased ppd (p<0.001) in the control group. comparison of the other clinicial parameters by the mann-whitney test showed differences only for pli, which was significantly higher (p<0.05) in the crf group. spearman's test applied to each group showed a positive correlation among all clinical parameters, except for gr (p<0.05). none of the groups showed  any correlation between gr and gi, while a significant negative correlation between gr and ppd was observed for the crf group. the percentage of bana-positive sites was 35.9% for the crf group and 35.7% for the control group.  the bana test correlated positively with ppd only in the control group and with gr only in the crf group. conclusions: in spite of a higher pli and dense anaerobic microbial population even in shallow ppd, patients with crf exhibited better periodontal conditions than periodontitis patients, which is an evidence of altered response to local irritants.

TI  == efficacy and safety of adjunctive local moxifloxacin delivery in the treatment of periodontitis.
AB  == background: moxifloxacin exerts excellent antibacterial activity against most putative periodontal pathogens and has been shown to kill bacteria in biofilm and host cells. methods: patients with chronic periodontitis were randomly assigned to receive a single subgingival application of a 0.125%, 0.4%, or 1.25% moxifloxacin gel or placebo gel immediately after full-mouth scaling and root planing (srp). clinical efficacy measurements were assessed in sites with baseline probing depth (pd) of >/=5.4 mm at 6 weeks and 3 months and any adverse  events were determined. in addition, putative periodontal pathogens and resistance of subgingival bacteria against moxifloxacin were assessed. results: data of 57 patients were included in the statistical analysis. in all treatment groups, the pd decreased from baseline to 3 months, with the greatest reduction seen in patients treated with moxifloxacin 0.4% (1.5 +/- 0.6 mm; p = 0.023 compared to placebo), followed by patients receiving moxifloxacin 1.25% (1.2 +/-  0.4), moxifloxacin 0.125% (1.1 +/- 1.1), and placebo (1.0 +/- 0.6). no linear trend for pd reduction with increasing moxifloxacin concentrations was found. porphyromonas gingivalis showed the greatest reduction in prevalence among the assessed pathogens, without any significant intergroup differences. no correlation or systematic relationship between adverse events, including bacterial resistance against moxifloxacin, and the investigational gels was found. conclusions: in periodontal pockets with pd of >/=5.4 mm, a single subgingival administration of a 0.4% moxifloxacin gel as an adjunct to srp may result in additional pd reduction compared to srp alone. in addition, the investigated moxifloxacin gels seem to be safe.

TI  == effect of khat chewing on periodontal pathogens in subgingival biofilm from chronic periodontitis patients.
AB  == aims: existing in vitro and in vivo data suggest that khat may have a favorable effect on periodontal microbiota. the purpose of this study was to assess the effect of khat chewing on major periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque samples from subjects with chronic periodontitis. materials and methods: 40 subgingival plaque samples were obtained from periodontitis and healthy sites of  10 khat chewers (40 y median age) and 10 khat non-chewers (37.5 y median age) with chronic periodontitis. absolute and relative counts of 6 periodontal pathogens were determined in each sample using highly sensitive and specific taqman real-time pcr assays. data were analyzed using an ordinal regression model. results: significantly more total bacteria were detected in samples from the periodontitis sites of the khat chewers (or=20). treponema denticola was present at significantly higher absolute counts at the healthy as well as periodontitis sites of the khat chewers (or=3.13 and 13, respectively). however,  the khat chewers harbored significantly lower absolute counts of porphyromonas gingivalis at the healthy sites (or=0.07). furthermore, khat chewing was significantly associated with lower relative counts of porphyromonas gingivalis,  fusobacterium ssp., prevotella ssp. and parvimonas micra-like species in subgingival plaque samples from both healthy and periodontitis sites (or=0.11-0.33). only treponema denticola was found in higher relative counts at the healthy sites of the khat chewers (or=2.98). conclusions: overall, there was  a lower burden of pathogens in the khat chewers. findings from the current study  are suggestive of a potential prebiotic effect for khat on periodontal microbiota.

TI  == relationship between oral status and prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria on the tongues of elderly individuals.
AB  == colonization of periodontopathic bacteria is associated with increased risk of systemic diseases. however, few studies have investigated the relationships between oral status factors and health-related quality of life (hr-qol) and the prevalence of such bacteria in elderly individuals. this study investigated the prevalence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia in 165 community-dwelling functionally independent 85-year-old japanese individuals (93 dentate, 72 edentulous) and the  relationship to oral status, including oral malodour and hr-qol. all four of the  studied periodontopathic bacteria were found more frequently in tongue coating samples from dentate than edentulous subjects, and the prevalence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola was significantly related to the number of teeth with a periodontal pocket depth >/=4 mm. these results suggest the existence of a stable circulation of periodontopathic bacteria between the gingival sulcus and tongue coating over time with teeth. in addition, the presence of teeth with a deep pocket and colonization of treponema denticola were positively related to the level of ch(3)sh, whilst the number of present teeth contributed positively to hr-qol, especially with regard to mental health. in conclusion, as the dentate state can  retain colonization of periodontopathic pathogens in the oral cavity, both periodontal treatment and tongue care are important for maintaining a healthy oral status in the elderly, and possibly result in avoidance of risk for tooth loss and decline in hr-qol, as well as protecting from systemic diseases.

TI  == [association between phenytoin-induced gingival hyperplasia and periodontopathic  bacteria in institutionalized patients with severe motor and intellectual disabilities].
AB  == the association between phenytoin-induced gingival hyperplasia (pigh) and five major periodontopathic bacteria was investigated by real-time pcr in 12 subjects  (30.6 +/- 7.95 years of age) with severe motor and intellectual disabilities. the subjects had not received antibiotics or periodontal therapy within three months. a healthy gingival site or a site with the lowest gingival hyperplasia score (minimum site), and a site with the maximum score of gingival hyperplasia (maximum site) on each subject were selected for investigation. the clinical parameters were measured after microbial sampling. the following results were obtained: 1. the detection rates of both treponema denticola and porphyromonas gingivalis were 75% (9/12) at the maximum sites, and that of tannerella forsythia was 33.3% (4/12). the detection rate of prevotella intermedia was 58.3% (7/12), but no significant correlation was observed between this bacterium and the other  types of bacteria in quantitative analysis. 2. the detection rate of p. gingivalis with type ii fima was 25% (1/4) at the minimum sites, and 83.3% (5/6)  at the maximum sites. 3. the samples were divided into three groups; namely, those with no detection of p. gingivalis at either the minimum sites or the maximum sites, no detection at the minimum sites but detection at the maximum sites, and detection at both sites. in conclusion, 1) the detection rates of t. denticola and p. gingivalis were the highest at the maximum sites. in particular, the detection rate of p. gingivalis with type ii fima was high in the present study, and 2) the subgingival microflora was diverse because of the diverse severity of gingival inflammation associated with pigh.

TI  == the ability of the bana test to detect different levels of p. gingivalis, t. denticola and t. forsythia.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of the bana test to detect different levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella  forsythia or their combinations in subgingival samples at the initial diagnosis and after periodontal therapy. periodontal sites with probing depths between 5-7  mm and clinical attachment level between 5-10 mm, from 53 subjects with chronic periodontitis, were sampled in four periods: initial diagnosis (t0), immediately  (t1), 45 (t2) and 60 days (t3) after scaling and root planing. bana test and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization identified red complex species in the subgingival biofilm. in all experimental periods, the highest frequencies of score 2 (checkerboard dna-dna hybridization) for p. gingivalis, t. denticola and  t. forsythia were observed when strong enzymatic activity (bana) was present (p < 0.01). the best agreement was observed at initial diagnosis. the bana test sensitivity was 95.54% (t0), 65.18% (t1), 65.22% (t2) and 50.26% (t3). the specificity values were 12.24% (t0), 57.38% (t1), 46.27% (t2) and 53.48% (t3). the bana test is more effective for the detection of red complex pathogens when the bacterial levels are high, i.e. in the initial diagnosis of chronic periodontitis.

TI  == characterization of the normal bacterial flora in peri-implant sulci of partially and completely edentulous patients.
AB  == purpose: to characterize the normal bacterial flora and evaluate the presence of  periodontopathogenic bacteria around dental implants and to correlate them with the periodontal flora or, in completely edentulous patients, the alveolar gingival flora. materials and methods: clinical and radiographic parameters were  recorded to exclude peri-implantitis in 34 partially edentulous and 19 completely edentulous patients. partially edentulous patients were subdivided into two subgroups based on the depth of the periodontal pocket: </= 4 mm (n = 19) and > 4 mm (n = 15). microbial samples were collected from peri-implant sulci, the deepest periodontal sulci, and, for completely edentulous patients, from the alveolar gingiva. predominant aerobic bacteria were determined by microbiologic culturing, and multiplex polymerase chain reaction was used to detect five periodontopathogenic bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. results: in all the examined patients, oral streptococci were the most frequent aerobic peri-implant bacteria. the frequency of four periodontopathogenic bacteria in tooth sulci (a actino?mycetemcomitans, p gingivalis, t forsythensis, t denticola) was significantly higher around natural  teeth with deeper periodontal pockets, but there was no significant difference in the frequency of the same bacteria in peri-implant sulci in the two partially edentulous subgroups. in contrast, there were no such bacteria in the peri-implant sulci or the alveolar gingiva of completely edentulous patients. conclusions: in healthy peri-implant sulci, oral streptococci constitute the predominant bacterial flora. in partially edentulous patients four periodontopathogenic bacteria were detected around implants, and none of these bacteria were found around implants in completely edentulous patients.

TI  == 16s rrna-based detection of oral pathogens in coronary atherosclerotic plaque.
AB  == background: atherosclerosis develops as a response of the vessel wall to injury.  chronic bacterial infections have been associated with an increased risk for atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. the ability of oral pathogens to colonize in coronary atheromatous plaque is well known. aim: the aim of this study was to detect the presence of treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis and campylobacter rectus in the subgingival and atherosclerotic plaques of patients with coronary artery disease. materials and methods: fifty-one patients  in the age group of 40-80 years with coronary artery disease were selected for the study. dna was extracted from the plaque samples. the specific primers for t. denticola, c. rectus and p. gingivalis were used to amplify a part of the 16s rrna gene by polymerase chain reaction. statistical analysis used: chi-square analysis, correlation coefficient and prevalence percentage of the microorganisms were carried out for the analysis. results: of the 51 patients, t. denticola, c.  rectus and p. gingivalis were detected in 49.01%, 21.51% and 45.10% of the atherosclerotic plaque samples. conclusions: our study revealed the presence of bacterial dna of the oral pathogenic microorganisms in coronary atherosclerotic plaques. the presence of the bacterial dna in the coronary atherosclerotic plaques in significant proportion may suggest the possible relationship between periodontal bacterial infection and genesis of coronary atherosclerosis.

TI  == examination of periodontal pathogens in stenotic valve specimens and in whole blood samples in patients affected by aortic valve stenosis and chronic periodontitis.
AB  == periodontitis may be a risk factor for atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. the influence of periodontal pathogens in cardiovascular diseases needs  further investigation. therefore, the aims of this clinical study are: to test the presence of periodontal bacteria dna in aortic valves and to assess the concomitant presence of the same periodontal bacteria dna in whole blood samples  in patients affected by aortic valve stenosis and chronic periodontitis. nineteen consecutive patients (12 males and 7 females, age: 49-85 years) were enrolled in  this study after having been subjected to a complete periodontal evaluation to confirm the diagnosis of chronic periodontitis. all patients were scheduled for aortic valve replacement surgery. after clinical and microbial periodontal examination, the aortic valve tissue specimens were obtained by excision during valve replacement surgery and the patients were subjected to the whole blood sampling before the surgery. the polymerase chain reaction technology was used to detect the putative periodontal pathogens tannerella forshytia, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens and treponema  denticola. neither the 19 aortic valve specimens nor the blood samples were positive for the genoma of the selected periodontal pathogens. the selected periodontal pathogens did not colonize the aortic valve of patients affected by stenosis and bacterial genoma was not present in whole blood samples. a high blood pressure at the aortic valve may prevent the adhesion and proliferation of  bacterial colonies.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola mixed microbial infection in a rat model of periodontal disease.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola are periodontal pathogens that express virulence factors associated with the pathogenesis of periodontitis. in this paper we tested the hypothesis that p. gingivalis and t. denticola are synergistic in terms of virulence; using a model of mixed microbial infection in  rats. groups of rats were orally infected with either p. gingivalis or t. denticola or mixed microbial infections for 7 and 12 weeks. p. gingivalis genomic dna was detected more frequently by pcr than t. denticola. both bacteria induced  significantly high igg, igg2b, igg1, igg2a antibody levels indicating a stimulation of th1 and th2 immune response. radiographic and morphometric measurements demonstrated that rats infected with the mixed infection exhibited significantly more alveolar bone loss than shaminfected control rats. histology revealed apical migration of junctional epithelium, rete ridge elongation, and crestal alveolar bone resorption; resembling periodontal disease lesion. these results showed that p. gingivalis and t. denticola exhibit no synergistic virulence in a rat model of periodontal disease.

TI  == periodontitis: a polymicrobial disruption of host homeostasis.
AB  == periodontitis, or gum disease, affects millions of people each year. although it  is associated with a defined microbial composition found on the surface of the tooth and tooth root, the contribution of bacteria to disease progression is poorly understood. commensal bacteria probably induce a protective response that  prevents the host from developing disease. however, several bacterial species found in plaque (the 'red-complex' bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) use various mechanisms to interfere with host  defence mechanisms. furthermore, disease may result from 'community-based' attack on the host. here, i describe the interaction of the host immune system with the  oral bacteria in healthy states and in diseased states.

TI  == roles of oral bacteria in cardiovascular diseases--from molecular mechanisms to clinical cases: implication of periodontal diseases in development of systemic diseases.
AB  == periodontal diseases, some of the most common infectious diseases seen in humans, are characterized by gingival inflammation, as well as loss of connective tissue  and bone from around the roots of the teeth, which leads to eventual tooth exfoliation. in the past decade, the association of periodontal diseases with the development of systemic diseases has received increasing attention. although a number of studies have presented evidence of close relationships between periodontal and systemic diseases, the majority of findings are limited to epidemiological studies, while the etiological details remain unclear. nevertheless, a variety of recent hypothesis driven investigations have compiled  various results showing that periodontal infection and subsequent direct oral-hematogenous spread of bacteria are implicated in the development of various systemic diseases. herein, we present current understanding in regard to the relationship between periodontal and systemic diseases, including cardiovascular  diseases, preterm delivery of low birth weight, diabetes mellitus, respiratory diseases, and osteoporosis.

TI  == mixture of periodontopathogenic bacteria influences interaction with kb cells.
AB  == introduction: the purpose of this study was to investigate the adhesion and invasion of periodontopathogenic bacteria in varied mixed infections and the release of interleukins from an epithelial cell line (kb cells). methods: kb cells were co-cultured with porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 and m5-1-2, tannerella forsythia atcc 43037, treponema denticola atcc 35405 and fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586 in single and mixed infections. the numbers of adherent and  internalized bacteria were determined up to 18 h after bacterial exposure. additionally, the mrna expression and concentrations of released interleukin (il)-6 and il-8 were measured. results: all periodontopathogenic bacteria adhered and internalized in different numbers to kb cells, but individually without any evidence of co-aggregation also to f. nucleatum. high levels of epithelial mrna of il-6 and il-8 were detectable after all bacterial challenges. after the mixed  infection of p. gingivalis atcc 33277 and f. nucleatum atcc 25586 the highest levels of released interleukins were found. no il-6 and il-8 were detectable after the mixed infection of p. gingivalis m5-1-2 and f. nucleatum atcc 25586 and the fourfold infection of p. gingivalis atcc 33277, t. denticola atcc 35405, t. forsythia atcc 43037 and f. nucleatum atcc 25586. conclusion: anaerobic periodontopathogenic bacteria promote the release of il-6 and il-8 by epithelial  cells. despite a continuous epithelial expression of il-8 mrna by all bacterial infections these effects are temporary because of the time-dependent degradation  of cytokines by bacterial proteases. mixed infections have a stronger virulence potential than single bacteria. further research is necessary to evaluate the role of mixed infections and biofilms in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

TI  == the del/del genotype of the nuclear factor-kappab -94attg polymorphism and its relation to aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: periodontitis is influenced by specific host-dependent  immune responses. periodontopathogens induce innate immune responses, amongst others, via toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2), resulting in activation of the nuclear transcription factor nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab). the aim of this case-control study was to evaluate links between genetic variants of these genes  and chronic/aggressive periodontitis in a multivariate model. material and methods: a total of 141 patients with periodontitis (63 with chronic periodontitis and 78 with aggressive periodontitis) and 81 controls without periodontitis were included in the study. polymorphisms in tlr2 (arg677trp, arg753gln) and in nf-kappab (-94ins/delattg) were determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism and fragment length analyses, respectively. subgingival bacterial colonization was evaluated using a pcr/dna probe test (micro-ident). results: although there was no association of the tlr2 polymorphism arg753gln with periodontitis, heterozygous carriers (arg/gln) were at a higher risk for colonization with bacteria of the 'red complex' (corrected p-value = 0.042). the del/del genotype of the nf-kappab polymorphism was associated with aggressive periodontitis considering age, gender, smoking and approximal plaque index as potential confounders (odds ratio = 2.81, p = 0.035, 95% confidence interval: 1.08-7.33). del/del carriers had a higher risk for subgingival colonization with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (odds ratio = 2.36, p = 0.030, 95% confidence interval: 1.09-5.1; adjusted for age, gender, smoking and pocket depth(bacteria)). conclusions: the del/del genotype of nf-kappab was shown to be associated with the occurrence of aggressive periodontitis.

TI  == do elderly edentulous patients with a history of periodontitis harbor periodontal pathogens?
AB  == objectives: the presence of periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity may impact implant survival. therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, eikenella corrodens and parvimonas micra in a specific elderly population with a history of periodontitis who have never worn dentures. material and methods: thirty dentate subjects (mean age 61.7+/-7.05 years) and 30 edentulous subjects (mean age 65.8+/-8.05 years) were included in this cross-sectional study. microbiological samples of cheek mucosa and the dorsum of  the tongue were taken from all subjects. in addition, sulcus samples were taken from the dentate group. all samples were analysed using a bacterial dna-specific  polymerase chain reaction. results: all the pathogens studied were detected in dentate and edentulous subjects. when cheek and tongue samples were combined, c.  rectus, a. actinomycetemcomitans and e. corrodens presented with a similar prevalence in both groups, whereas the other species were more prevalent specifically in the dentate group (p<0.05). in dentate subjects, p. intermedia and t. denticola were present in higher frequencies in the cheek mucosa (26.67% and 66.67%, respectively), whereas p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were more prevalent in the tongue samples (26.67% and 56.67%, respectively). conclusions: periodontal pathogens may persist in the oral cavity of edentulous subjects who have had periodontal disease, even 1 year after the extraction of all teeth and in the absence of other hard surfaces in the mouth.

TI  == supernatants from oral epithelial cells and gingival fibroblasts modulate human immunodeficiency virus type 1 promoter activation induced by periodontopathogens  in monocytes/macrophages.
AB  == bacterial and host cell products during coinfections of human immunodeficiency virus type 1-positive (hiv-1(+)) patients regulate hiv-1 recrudescence in latently infected cells (e.g. t cells, monocytes/macrophages), impacting highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart) failure and progression of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. a high frequency of oral opportunistic infections (e.g. periodontitis) in hiv-1(+) patients has been demonstrated; however, their potential to impact hiv-1 exacerbation is unclear. we sought to determine the ability of supernatants derived from oral epithelial cells (okf4) and human gingival fibroblasts (gin-4) challenged with periodontal pathogens, to modulate the hiv-1 promoter activation in monocytes/macrophages. bf24 monocytes/macrophages transfected with the hiv-1 promoter driving the expression  of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) were stimulated with porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, or treponema denticola in the presence of supernatants from okf4 or gin4 cells either unstimulated or previously pulsed with bacteria. cat levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and cytokine production was evaluated by luminex beadlyte assays. okf4 and gin4 supernatants enhanced hiv-1 promoter activation particularly related to f. nucleatum challenge. an additive effect was observed in hiv-1 promoter activation when monocytes/macrophages were simultaneously stimulated with gingival cell supernatants and bacterial extracts. okf4 cells produced higher levels of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf) and interleukins -6 and -8 in response to f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis. preincubation of okf4 supernatants with anti-gm-csf reduced the additive effect in periodontopathogen-induced hiv-1 promoter activation. these results suggest that  soluble mediators produced by gingival resident cells in response to periodontopathogens could contribute to hiv-1 promoter activation in monocytes/macrophages, albeit this effect is most notable following direct stimulation of the cells with oral gram-negative bacteria.

AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia have been strongly associated with chronic periodontitis. this disease is characterized by  an accumulation of inflammatory cells in periodontal tissue and subgingival sites. the secretion of high levels of inflammatory cytokines by those cells is believed to contribute to periodontal tissue destruction. the aim of this study was to investigate the inflammatory response of whole blood from periodontitis patients following challenges with whole cells of p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia or their lipopolysaccharides (lps), individually and in combination. whole blood collected from seven periodontitis patients was stimulated with whole cells or lps and the production of interleukin (il)-1beta,  il-6, il-8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. the mono and mixed challenges with whole bacterial cells or lps induced the secretion of high amounts of il-1beta, il-6, il-8, and tnf-alpha by the mixed leukocyte population from periodontitis patients. in addition, p. gingivalis lps, t. denticola lps, and t. forsythia lps  acted in synergy to induce high levels of il-1beta and tnf-alpha. this study suggests that p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia may contribute to the immunodestructive host response characteristic of periodontitis through synergistic effects of their lps on the inflammatory response induced by a mixed  population of leukocytes.

TI  == photodynamic therapy in periodontal therapy: microbiological observations from a  private practice.
AB  == in recent years, the combination of laser light and photosensitizer known as photodynamic therapy (pdt) has been used in periodontal therapy. however, there are not enough clinical studies to fully evaluate the effects of pdt on the periodontal tissues. this microbiological study examined the effects of pdt on the periodontal bacteria in combination with scaling and root planing (srp) in the same group of patients by randomly selecting pdt or srp for use in different  quadrants of the mouth. for the present study, pdt was compared with a diode laser (980 nm) and an nd:ya g laser (1,064 nm). microbiological samples were examined and evaluated over a period of three months. significant bacterial reduction has been observed in all cases. the diode laser with srp presented long-term positive results, while pdt showed a significant bacteria reduction during the entire observation period.

TI  == efficacy of amoxicillin and metronidazole combination for the management of generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: the aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of metronidazole-amoxicillin combination on clinical and microbiologic parameters in patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis. methods: twenty-eight patients were randomly included. the test group (n = 12) received amoxicillin-metronidazole combination and scaling and root planing; the control group (n = 16) received scaling and root planing alone. in addition to the clinical examinations, subgingival plaque samples were analyzed for total cultivable bacteria and the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella pallens, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) using polymerase chain reaction. results: all clinical parameters improved significantly compared to baseline (p <0.05) in both groups. there was a statistically significant reduction of pockets and clinical attachment gain in the combined group compared to the control group (p <0.05). total counts of bacteria also decreased significantly at 3 and 6 months in both groups (p <0.05). t. denticola and t. forsythia were the most prevalent bacteria throughout the study. t. denticola showed a continuous decrease over 6 months in the test group, whereas no change was seen in the control group beyond 3 months. p. gingivalis decreased significantly at 3 months (p <0.05), whereas t. forsythia was the only  pathogen decreased below detection limits by the combination therapy with a significant difference compared to the control group (p <0.05). conclusions: the  results from this study suggest that combined amoxicillin and metronidazole use as an adjunct to scaling and root planing leads to better clinical healing compared to mechanical treatment alone. the polypharmaceutical approach used results in a significant and substantial decrease in t. forsythia and prevents its recolonization for 6 months, suggesting that t. forsythia may determine the long-term stability of periodontal treatment outcomes.

TI  == the relationship between physiologic halitosis and periodontopathic bacteria of the tongue and gingival sulcus.
AB  == to determine the influence of oral status on halitosis, the relationship between  halitosis and periodontopathic bacteria present in plaque on the tongue and the subgingival sulcus was examined in 62 periodontally healthy adults. halitosis indicators used were the organoleptic score; gas chromatography results [total volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) = h(2)s + ch(3)sh + (ch(3))(2)s]; halimeter values; and the results of three clinical tests, plaque control record (plcr), plaque index (pli), and tongue coat status. significant correlations with organoleptic scores was observed for plcr, pli, tongue coat status, vsc amounts,  and halimeter values, indicating that halitosis in periodontally healthy subjects tended to originate from tongue plaque deposits. polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to detect six periodontopathic bacteria (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis, and treponema denticola) from the tongue and subgingival plaque. significant effects on the organoleptic scores, tongue coat status, total vsc, h(2)s and ch(3)sh amounts, and halimeter values were observed only for t. denticola and f. nucleatum and only in the tongue plaque, not in the subgingival plaque. thus, therapies developed to inhibit the growth of these bacteria may lead to future treatments of halitosis.

TI  == community periodontal index of treatment needs index: an indicator of anaerobic periodontal infection.
AB  == background: community periodontal index of treatment needs (cpitn) index is commonly used to measure periodontal disease. it's uniqueness, apart from assessing the periodontal status, also gives the treatment needs for the underlying condition. benzoyl-dl-arginine napthylamide (bana) test is a chair side diagnostic test used to detect the presence of putative periodontal pathogens. we correlated the cpitn scores of patients with bana test results to assess the validity of cpitn as an indicator of anaerobic periodontal infection.  objectives: the present study was aimed to correlate the cpitn scores with the bana activity of subgingival plaque. the objective was to assess the validity of  cpitn index as indicator of anaerobic periodontal infection. patients and methods: a total of 80 sites were selected from 20 patients with generalized chronic periodontitis. after measuring the probing depth with cpitn c probe, the  highest score from each sextant was selected according to the cpitn criteria and  subgingival plaque samples were collected using a sterile curette and the bana test was performed. results: kendall's tau-b and chi-square test were used to assess the correlation between the bana test results and cpitn scores. results indicated sensitivity (92.86%), specificity (80%) and agreement (91.25%); indicating the validity of cpitn in assessing anaerobic infection. conclusion: there was a significant correlation between bana test results and scores 3 and score 4 of cpitn index (p < 0.001) clearly indicating the presence of anaerobic periodontal infection.

TI  == periodontal bacterial load: a proposed new epidemiological method for periodontal disease assessment.
AB  == aim: the purpose of this study was to identify a periodontal clinical measure that correlates with red complex bacteria usually associated with periodontal disease. methods and materials: periodontal clinical parameters were recorded in  116 postpartum women at six sites per tooth for all teeth excluding third molars. two subgingival plaque samples per subject were collected and analyzed for 39 bacterial species using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. periodontal bacterial load (pbl) was calculated as the sum of all pocket depth measurements of 4 mm at sites with a clinical attachment level (cal) of 4 mm. the association of clinical and bacterial scores was analyzed using the spearman correlation coefficient and the kruskal-wallis test. results: the pbl was correlated with microorganisms from the red complex that included porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola, individually or grouped (p<0.05). the pbl was not associated with periodontally beneficial species from the yellow, green, purple, and blue complexes (p>0.05). the proportions and mean counts of the red complex were increased according to the quartile groups of distribution of the pbl. conclusion: pbl appears to be a reliable measure of periodontal status in postpartum women. clinical significance: pbl avoids bias in the assessment of periodontal status in studies  of periodontal disease.

TI  == subgingival plaque removal using a new air-polishing device.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, patient acceptance, and short-term microbiologic effect of a new air-polishing device in  subjects in maintenance care with residual pockets > or =5 mm. methods: this was  an examiner-masked, randomized, split-mouth clinical trial. a new disposable nozzle, allowing the subgingival application of amino acid glycine powder at a limited pressure, was compared to scaling and root planing (srp) in 50 subjects with residual pockets during the maintenance phase. after removing supragingival  deposits, the spray was applied for 4 to 5 seconds in all sites > or =5 mm in the test quadrant, whereas srp was used in the control quadrant. microbiologic samples were taken from one treated test and one control site 2 days before and 7 days after treatment. total bacterial counts and the counts of six periodontal pathogens were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: no adverse event was noted in any subject for the test or control treatment. using a visual analog scale, the patients perceived the test treatment to be significantly less painful/uncomfortable than the hand instrumentation (p <0.001). significantly less time was used by the operator for the test procedure  (p <0.001). the reduction in bleeding on probing was significant for the treated  sites in the test and control quadrants (p = 0.019 and p <0.001, respectively), but traditional srp reduced the bleeding tendency significantly more than air polishing (p = 0.045). the differences in the total bacterial load and the counts of six periodontal pathogens between the test and control sites did not reach statistical significance. the longitudinal reduction was significant in control sites for total bacteria load (p <0.001), porphyromonas gingivalis (p = 0.01), treponema denticola (p <0.001), and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (p <0.001). conclusion: subgingival air polishing with a new device was safe (no adverse events were noted), perceived to be more acceptable by the patients, and was more time-efficient than srp; however, on a microbiologic level, it was not superior to conventional srp.

TI  == microbiologic testing and outcomes of full-mouth scaling and root planing with or without amoxicillin/metronidazole in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: it has been suggested that use of systemic antibiotics should be limited to patients with specific microbiologic profiles. the main purpose of the present analysis was to study whether microbiologic testing before therapy was of value in predicting which patients would specifically benefit from adjunctive amoxicillin and metronidazole, given in the context of full-mouth scaling and root planing (srp) within 48 hours. methods: this was a 6-month, single-center, double-masked, placebo-controlled, randomized longitudinal study. fifty-one patients received full-mouth periodontal debridement, performed within 48 hours;  then, 25 subjects received metronidazole, 500 mg, and amoxicillin, 375 mg, three  times a day for 7 days, and 26 received a placebo (control group). pooled microbiologic samples were taken from the deepest pocket at baseline in each quadrant before and 6 months after treatment. six periodontal pathogens were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: forty-seven patients  were followed for 6 months. after treatment, test subjects had a substantially lower mean number of persisting sites with probing depth >4 mm and bleeding on probing than did control subjects (0.4 versus 3.0; p = 0.005; month 6). aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) could not be detected in the antibiotic group after treatment. however, in the placebo group, three of six subjects positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans continued to be positive. lower frequencies were also noted in the test group for porphyromonas gingivalis (p = 0.013) and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (p = 0.007). however, even subjects testing negative for a. actinomycetemcomitans at baseline had a significantly better primary clinical outcome if they received the active drugs. the presence of six putative periodontal pathogens (a. actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum spp., p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and t. forsythia) quantified prior to therapy was not correlated with the outcome of full-mouth srp with or without amoxicillin and metronidazole. conclusion: excellent clinical results in the antibiotics group were obtained regardless of the presence or absence of six classic periodontal periopathogens prior to treatment.

TI  == evaluating clinical periodontal measures as surrogates for bacterial exposure: the oral infections and vascular disease epidemiology study (invest).
AB  == background: epidemiologic studies of periodontal infection as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease often use clinical periodontal measures as a surrogate for the underlying bacterial exposure of interest. there are currently no methodological studies evaluating which clinical periodontal measures best reflect the levels of subgingival bacterial colonization in population-based settings. we investigated the characteristics of clinical periodontal definitions that were most representative of exposure to bacterial species that are believed  to be either markers, or themselves etiologic, of periodontal disease. methods: 706 men and women aged >or= 55 years, residing in northern manhattan were enrolled. using dna-dna checkerboard hybridization in subgingival biofilms, standardized values for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia were averaged within mouth and summed to define "bacterial burden". correlations of bacterial burden with clinical periodontal constructs defined by the severity and extent of attachment loss (al), pocket depth (pd) and bleeding on probing (bop) were assessed. results: clinical periodontal constructs demonstrating the highest correlations with bacterial burden were: i) percent of sites with bop (r = 0.62); ii) percent of sites with pd >or= 3 mm (r = 0.61); and iii) number of sites with  bop (r = 0.59). increasing pd or al severity thresholds consistently attenuated correlations, i.e., the correlation of bacterial burden with the percent of sites with pd >or= 8 mm was only r = 0.16. conclusions: clinical exposure definitions of periodontal disease should incorporate relatively shallow pockets to best reflect whole mouth exposure to bacterial burden.

TI  == association of human t lymphotropic virus 1 amplification of periodontitis severity with altered cytokine expression in response to a standard periodontopathogen infection.
AB  == background: periodontal diseases (pds) are infectious diseases in which periodontopathogens trigger chronic inflammatory and immune responses that lead to tissue destruction. recently, viruses have been implicated in the pathogenesis of pds. individuals infected with human t lymphotropic virus 1 (htlv-1) present with abnormal oral health and a marked increased prevalence of periodontal disease. methods: in this study, we investigated the patterns of periodontopathogen infection and local inflammatory immune markers in htlv-1-seropositive individuals with chronic periodontitis (cp/htlv-1 group) compared with htlv-1-seronegative individuals with chronic periodontitis (cp group) and periodontally healthy, htlv-1-seronegative individuals (control group). results: patients in the cp/htlv-1 group had significantly higher values  of bleeding on probing, mean probing depth, and attachment loss than patients in  the cp group. the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin (il)  4 was found to be similar in the cp and cp/htlv-1 groups, whereas il-12 and il-17 levels trended toward a higher expression in the cp/htlv-1 group. a significant increase was seen in the levels of il-1beta and interferon gamma in the cp/htlv-1 group compared with the cp group, whereas expression of the regulatory t cell marker foxp3 and il-10 was significantly decreased in the lesions from the cp/htlv-1 group. interestingly, similar frequency and/or load of periodontopathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) and frequency of viruses (herpes simplex virus 1, human cytomegalovirus, and epstein-barr virus) characteristically associated with pds were found in the cp/htlv and cp groups. conclusions: htlv-1 may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease through the deregulation of the local cytokine network, resulting in an exacerbated response against a standard periodontopathogen infection.

TI  == transmission of periodontopathic bacteria from natural teeth to implants.
AB  == purpose: prevention of peri-implantitis is essential for the success of implant rehabilitation. infection by periodontopathic bacteria is a major cause of peri-implantitis. the aim of the present study was to identify the source of peri-implant colonization by periodontopathic bacteria. materials and methods: twenty-one patients with implants were enrolled in the study. subgingival plaque  samples from the adjacent, occluding, and contralateral natural teeth were collected prior to second-stage surgery. samples from implant sulci were then obtained 2 weeks later. detection of periodontopathic bacteria was performed by the polymerase chain reaction. results: the detection rates for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and fusobacterium nucleatum in all subgingival samples from natural teeth were similar to that in the peri-implant sulci. multiple logistic regression analysis revealed an association between the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and f. nucleatum in the gingival crevices of adjacent teeth and that of the peri-implant sulcus, but no association for tannerella forsythia. conclusions: the present findings suggest that colonization by a. actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and f. nucleatum at the implant sulcus was affected by these microorganisms in the gingival crevice of adjacent teeth rather than those on occluding and contralateral teeth.

TI  == microbiologic changes in subgingival plaque after removal of fixed orthodontic appliances.
AB  == objective: to evaluate changes that occur in the subgingival microbiota after removal of fixed orthodontic appliances using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). materials and methods: thirty orthodontic patients (11 males and 19 females; aged 20 +/- 7.3 yr) were included in this study. subgingival plaque samplings were gathered from the disto-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper central incisors and the left lower central incisors, and from the mesio-buccal gingival  crevice of the left upper first molars and the left lower first molars, at two different times: 2 weeks before appliance removal (t1), and 3 months after appliance removal (t2). dna was extracted from the samples and the 16s rrna-based pcr detection method was used to determine the prevalence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans , tannerella forsythia , campylobacter rectus , eikenella corrodens , porphyromonas gingivalis , prevotella intermedia , prevotella nigrescens , and treponema denticola , which are considered as putative periodontopathogens. results: the frequency of positive sites at t1 and t2 was 65% and 43.3% for c. rectus , and 53.3% and 30.8% for e. corrodens , respectively. for the other bacteria, the frequency tended to be reduced between  times. conclusion: periodontopathogens during orthodontic treatment were significantly reduced within 3 months of appliance removal. however, how long it  takes to return to the preorthodontic composition of the subgingival microbiota and whether it happens at all remain to be seen.

TI  == progression of chronic periodontitis can be predicted by the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola in subgingival plaque.
AB  == introduction: chronic periodontitis is an inflammatory disease of the supporting  tissues of the teeth associated with bacteria. diagnosis is achieved retrospectively by clinical observation of attachment loss. predicting disease progression would allow for targeted preventive therapy. the aim of this study was to monitor disease progression in patients on a maintenance program and determine the levels of specific bacteria in subgingival plaque samples and then  examine the ability of the clinical parameters of disease and levels of specific  bacteria in the plaque samples to predict disease progression. methods: during a  12-month longitudinal study of 41 subjects, 25 sites in 21 subjects experienced disease progression indicated by at least 2 mm of clinical attachment loss. real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia in subgingival plaque samples. results: no clinical parameters were able to predict periodontal disease progression. in sites undergoing imminent periodontal disease progression within  the next 3 months, significant partial correlations were found between p. gingivalis and t. forsythia (r = 0.55, p < 0.001) and t. denticola and t. forsythia (r = 0.43, p = 0.04). the odds of a site undergoing imminent periodontal disease progression increased with increasing levels of p. gingivalis and t. denticola. conclusion: monitoring the proportions of p. gingivalis and t.  denticola in subgingival plaque has the potential to help identify sites at significant risk for progression of periodontitis, which would assist in the targeted treatment of disease.

AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the short-term performance of a session of single photodynamic therapy (pdt) and of a conventional ultrasonic debridement (ust) in persistent pockets of maintenance patients. in a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blind clinical study, patients with chronic periodontitis with at least two persistent pockets (>4 mm) were enrolled. they were treated either with ust (n = 29) or pdt (n = 25). clinical and microbiological examinations were performed at baseline and after 3 months. for ust, the mean probing depth was reduced from 5.3 to 4.5 mm (p = <0.001) and for pdt from 5.3 to 4.7 mm (p < 0.001) with no difference between the two treatment modalities. microbial counts were significantly reduced about 30% to 40% immediately after debridement but returned to baseline values a 3 months irrespective of treatment. pdt is not superior to conventional mechanical treatment of persistent pockets, but it may be a meaningful therapeutic alternative; the clinical effects were too minor to draw a definitive conclusion.

AB  == background: recent developments in molecular biological techniques have enabled rapid detection of periodontopathic bacterial species in clinical specimens. accumulated evidence suggests that detection of specific bacterial species enables identification of subjects at high risk for the onset of periodontitis. we investigated the distribution of 10 selected periodontopathic bacterial species in dental plaque specimens obtained from children with disabilities who were attending daycare centers. methods: a total of 187 children (136 boys, 51 girls) aged 1-6 years old and diagnosed with such disabilities as mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and autism, participated in the study. subgingival dental plaque specimens were collected from the buccal side of the maxillary left second primary molar after a clinical examination. bacterial dna was extracted from the specimens and pcr analyses were carried out to detect 10 selected periodontopathic species using specific primers for each. in addition, statistical analyses were performed to analyze the correlations among clinical parameters and the detected species. results: the most frequently detected species was capnocytophaga sputigena (28.3%), followed by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (20.9%) and campylobacter rectus (18.2%). eikenella corrodens, capnocytophaga ochracea, and prevotella nigrescence were detected in approximately 10% of the specimens, whereas treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella intermedia were rarely found, and porphyromonas gingivalis was not detected in any of the subjects. the total numbers of detected species were positively correlated with the age of the subjects. there were 10 subjects with positive reactions for t. denticola and/or t. forsythia, in whom the total number of bacterial species was significantly higher as compared to the other subjects. furthermore, subjects possessing c. rectus showed significantly greater values for periodontal pocket depth, gingival index, and total number of  species. conclusion: we found that approximately one-fourth of the present subjects with disabilities who possessed at least one of t. denticola, t. forsythia, and c. rectus were at possible risk for periodontitis. follow-up examinations as well as preventive approaches should be utilized for such individuals.

TI  == an unusual autopsy case of pyogenic liver abscess caused by periodontal bacteria.
AB  == pyogenic liver abscess (pla) formation is thought to originate from the transmission of infection via three major routes including the biliary tract, portal vein and hepatic artery. however, about 50% of pla cases are considered to be cryptogenic. here we report an unusual autopsy case of pla associated with periodontopathic bacterial infection. a 59-year-old female suddenly developed cardiopulmonary arrest and died. despite macroscopic and microscopic examinations, the infectious routes and source of infection were unidentified, and the case appeared to be cryptogenic. since this patient had suffered severe periodontitis for a long period of time, we investigated the involvement of periodontal infection in pla formation by performing immunohistochemical analyses. we identified several periodontopathic bacterial species in the pla of  this patient, including fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, prevotella  intermedia and porphyromonas gingivalis. thus, we demonstrate here that periodontal infection is a potential source of infection in the formation of pla.

TI  == one-stage full-mouth versus partial-mouth scaling and root planing during the effective half-life of systemically administered azithromycin.
AB  == background: one-stage full-mouth scaling and root planing (fm-srp) in combination with systemically administered azithromycin was shown to be clinically and bacteriologically effective in the treatment of chronic periodontitis. however, fm-srp requires 2 hours for completion. azithromycin has a long half-life. therefore, if srp of the full mouth is performed within 7 days while an effective concentration of azithromycin remains in the gingiva, the effects may be the same as fm-srp. the aim of this study was to compare the clinical and bacteriologic effects of fm-srp and partial-mouth scaling and root planing (pm-srp) in patients with chronic periodontitis, which was performed in three sessions within 7 days,  during the effective half-life of systemically administrated azithromycin. methods: thirty adult subjects with chronic periodontitis were randomly divided into three groups (fm-srp, pm-srp, and control). a clinical examination was conducted to record the probing depth, clinical attachment level gain, bleeding on probing, gingival index, and volume of gingival crevicular fluid; bacterial samples were obtained before treatment and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months thereafter.  quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed using the polymerase chain reaction-invader method. results: all clinical parameters showed better improvement in fm-srp and pm-srp groups compared to the control group, with no significant differences between the two test groups. periodontal bacteria were well controlled in the two test groups, but they tended to increase gradually 3 months after treatment in the control group. conclusion: pm- and fm-srp demonstrated comparable clinical and bacteriologic results.

AB  == the present study compared the recovery of six periodontal pathogens by paper point samples from two different aspects of periodontal lesions by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). twenty patients with untreated chronic periodontitis were randomized into two groups. before subgingival instrumentation and after 10 weeks samples in group a were taken first with a paper point half length (hp) of the probing depth, then with a paper point full length (fp) at the same site. in group b sampling sequence was reversed. analysis by real-time pcr enabled quantification of six bacteria as well as total bacterial count (tbc). statistical analysis included t test, kappa, and spearman's correlations. higher  tbc could be harvested by use of fp than by hp (mean of differences of ln-transformed counts before therapy: -0.791, ci [-1.515, -0.068], sd 0.770, p =  0.034; after therapy: -0.563, ci [-1.151, 0.024], sd 0.625, p = 0.059). the plaque composition regarding total target pathogens was similar for both samples. both, for tbc as well as for single target bacteria a strong positive correlation was found between hp and fp (kappa, spearman correlation: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans 0.807, 0.778; fusobacterium nucleatum 0.573, 0.772; porphyromonas gingivalis 0.733, 0.824; prevotella intermedia 0.480, 0.756; treponema denticola 0.807, 0.814; and tannerella forsythia 0.692, 0.695). the recovery of target pathogens was similar following sampling at various depths of  the periodontal lesion.

TI  == association between periodontitis and anti-cardiolipin antibodies in buerger disease.
AB  == aim: anti-cardiolipin (cl) antibodies can be induced in buerger disease (bd), an  inflammatory occlusive disorder affecting peripheral blood vessels, in response to bacteria bearing homology to the tlrvyk peptide of a phospholipid-binding plasma protein beta-2-glycoprotein i. tlrvyk homologies are present in porphyromonas gingivalis (tlriyt) and treponema denticola (tlalyk). this study investigated the association between periodontal infection and anti-cl antibodies in bd patients. material and methods: periodontal conditions were examined in 19  bd patients and 25 systemically healthy control subjects. all subjects were heavy smokers. serum anti-cl, anti-tlrvyk, anti-tlriyt, and anti-tlalyk antibodies were assessed using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: bd patients had a  significantly higher prevalence of periodontitis, more severe periodontal destruction and increased titres of serum anti-cl, anti-tlrvyk, anti-tlriyt, and  anti-tlalyk antibodies compared with healthy subjects. the levels of anti-cl antibodies positively correlated with those of the three anti-peptide antibodies. anti-cl antibody titres were significantly associated with the percentage of sites with clinical attachment level >or=4 mm in bd patients. conclusion: elevated anti-cl antibody levels were associated with periodontal destruction in  bd patients. periodontopathic bacteria may serve as exogenous antigens that stimulate the anti-cl antibody production through molecular mimicry between the bacterial peptides and a host plasma protein.

TI  == strong and persistent microbial and inflammatory stimuli overcome the genetic predisposition to higher matrix metalloproteinase-1 (mmp-1) expression: a mechanistic explanation for the lack of association of mmp1-1607 single-nucleotide polymorphism genotypes with mmp-1 expression in chronic periodontitis lesions.
AB  == aims: our objective was to evaluate the association between the mmp1-1607 single-nucleotide polymorphism (snp), periodontopathogens and inflammatory cytokines with matrix metalloproteinase-1 (mmp-1) mrna levels in vitro and in vivo. materials and methods: this study investigated the influence of genetic (mmp1-1607 snp), microbial (porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) and inflammatory [tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (il-1beta)] factors on the determination of mmp-1 mrna levels in periodontal tissues of non-smoker chronic periodontitis (cp, n=178) and control (c, n=190) groups. the effects of single and repeated lipopolysaccharide (lps) and inflammatory cytokine stimulation of macrophages with distinct mmp1-1607 snp genotypes were also investigated. results: in healthy tissues, the mmp1-1607 2g allele was associated with higher mmp-1 levels while in cp mmp-1 levels were associated with the presence and load of periodontopathogens, and also with tnf-alpha and il-1beta expression irrespective of the mmp1-1607 genotype. in vitro data demonstrate that in 2g macrophages low- and intermediate-dose lps and tnf-alpha+il-1beta stimulation was associated with increased mmp-1 expression, while strong and repeated stimulation resulted in higher mmp-1 levels irrespective of the mmp1-1607 genotype. conclusion: our data demonstrate a limited role for mmp1-1607 snp in periodontitis, where the extensive chronic antigenic challenge exposure overcomes the genetic control and plays a major role in the determination of mmp-1 expression.

TI  == bone microbial contamination influences autogenous grafting in sinus augmentation.
AB  == background: the oral occurrence of putative microbial pathogens in humans has been documented in health and disease. the presence of periodontopathogens in patients with a history of periodontal disease may have a negative impact on bone regeneration. this investigation was conducted to confirm the presence of periodontal pathogens in bone particles harvested intraorally for maxillary sinus augmentation and to assess the clinical and radiographic outcomes 6 to 12 months  after bone augmentation. methods: culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based identification were performed by paper-point sampling of intraorally  harvested bone particles in a group of 12 maintenance patients undergoing maxillary sinus augmentation. radiographs were taken to assess and compare bone healing and volume gain at baseline and at 6 to 12 months after augmentation. results: the presence of periodontal pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans [previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans], prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia [previously t. forsythensis], fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra [previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros], campylobacter rectus, enteric gram-negative rods, and dialister pneumosintes) was identified in 10 of 12 patients (83%) by culture, pcr, or both and was associated with greater bone volume loss at 6 months postaugmentation. the pcr-positive triad, p. gingivalis,  a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. intermedia, was associated with pronounced volume loss of the grafted sinus at 6 months. conclusions: to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to confirm osseous microbial contamination with major periodontopathogens in individuals undergoing maxillary sinus augmentation with a history of periodontitis. the effect on the grafting outcome  translated into bone volume loss in the grafted sinus 6 months postaugmentation.  specific microbial contamination may have an impact on osteogenesis in osseous regeneration.

TI  == microbiological risk for periodontitis of abutment teeth in patients with removable partial dentures.
AB  == tannerella forsythia, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola are identified as the red complex which exists in high proportions in periodontally diseased patients. the aim of this study was to assess the microbiological risk for periodontitis of abutment teeth in subjects wearing removable partial dentures (rpds) by measuring the red complex using bana-zymetm test. thirty-eight subjects (mean age: 62.2 years) with kennedy class ii partially edentulous arch participated in this study. the red complex and clinical parameters, such as plaque index, gingival index, probing depth and tooth mobility were recorded at abutment teeth in contact with the direct retainer of unilaterally designed rpds  and the corresponding non-abutment teeth on the opposite side. mean scores for the red complex, plaque index, gingival index and tooth mobility of the abutment  teeth were significantly greater than those of the non-abutment teeth (p < 0.01). no significant mean difference in pocket depth was found between the abutment and non-abutment teeth. logistic regression analysis revealed that abutment teeth, high scores of plaque index and a maintenance interval longer than 6 months were  significant predictors for positive red complex scores (p < 0.05). these results  suggest that the microbiological risk for periodontitis of abutment teeth is greater than that for non-abutment teeth in rpd wearers.

TI  == microbiological profile of untreated subjects with localized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == aim: the microbial profile of localized aggressive periodontitis (lagp) has not yet been determined. therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the subgingival microbial composition of lagp. material and methods: one hundred and  twenty subjects with lagp (n=15), generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp, n=25), chronic periodontitis (chp, n=30) or periodontal health (ph, n=50) underwent clinical and microbiological assessment. nine subgingival plaque samples were collected from each subject and analysed for their content of 38 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: red complex  and some orange complex species are the most numerous and prevalent periodontal pathogens in lagp. the proportions of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans were  elevated in shallow and intermediate pockets of lagp subjects in comparison with  those with gagp or chp, but not in deep sites. this species also showed a negative correlation with age and with the proportions of red complex pathogens.  the host-compatible actinomyces species were reduced in lagp. conclusion: a. actinomycetemcomitans seems to be associated with the onset of lagp, and porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum and prevotella intermedia play an important role in disease progression. successful treatment of lagp would involve a reduction in these pathogens and an increase in the actinomyces species.

TI  == characterizing traditionally defined periodontal disease in hiv+ adults.
AB  == background: results have varied from previous studies examining the level and extent of periodontal disease (pd) in hiv-1 infected (hiv+) adults. these studies used different methodologies to measure and define pd and examined cohorts with divergent characteristics. inconsistent methodological approaches may have resulted in the underestimation of traditionally-defined pd in hiv+ individuals.  objectives: to characterize the level, extent and predictors (i.e. immunologic, microbiologic, metabolic and behavioral) of pd in an hiv+ cohort during the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart). study design: cross-sectional study. setting: hiv+ adults receiving outpatient care at three major medical clinics in cleveland, oh. subjects were seen from may, 2005 to january, 2008. measurements: full-mouth periodontal examinations included periodontal probing depth (ppd), recession (rec) and clinical attachment level (cal). subgingival plaque was assessed for dna levels of porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola by real-time dna pcr assays developed for each pathogen. rather than using categories, we evaluated pd as three continuous variables based on the percent of teeth with >or=1 site per tooth with ppd >or= 5mm, rec > 0 mm and cal >or= 4mm. results: participants included 112 hiv+ adults. each subject had an average 38% (+/-24%) of their teeth with at least one site of pd >or= 5 mm, 55% (+/-31%) of their teeth with at least one site of rec > 0 mm, and 50% (+/-32%) of their teeth with at least one site of cal >or= 4 mm. cd4+ t-cell count <200 cells/mm(3) was significantly associated with higher levels of  rec and cal, but not ppd. greater levels of pg dna were associated with ppd, rec  and cal.by regression analysis, cd4+ t-cell count <200 cells /mm3 had approximately twice thedeleterious effect on cal as did smoking (standardized beta coefficient 0.306 versus 0.164) [corrected]. annual dental visit compliance  remained an independent predictor for lower levels of pd. conclusions: the level  and extent of pd were high in this cohort even though most patients were being treated with haart. the definition of periodontal disease used and cohort characteristics examined can influence the level of periodontal disease reported  in studies of persons with hiv. traditional periodontal pathogens are associated  with pd in this cohort. those with cd4+ t-cell counts <200 cells/mm(3) are at greater risk for pd. therefore, earlier haart initiation may decrease exposure to immunosuppression and reduce pd morbidity. continuity of dental care remains important for hiv+ patients even when they are being treated with haart.

TI  == detection and quantification of five major periodontal pathogens by single copy gene-based real-time pcr.
AB  == periodontitis is a common chronic multibacterial infection in the tooth-supporting tissues. it has been shown that periodontitis patients carry higher number of disease-associated bacteria than healthy ones. the aim of this study was to generate a novel, single copy gene-based quantitative real-time pcr  (qpcr) assay for five major periodontal pathogens - aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia. the primer/probe sets were designed for conservative lipopolysaccharide-coding gene regions. they proved to be sensitive  and able to detect strains representing different serotypes of the target bacteria. the specificity of designed primers was tested using 49 selected bacterial species and no false positive or negative results were observed. we validated the assay with a case-control population, including 165 saliva samples, and proved the diagnostic accuracy by receiver operating characteristic (roc) curves. all quantified pathogens alone were able to distinguish significantly between the subjects with and without periodontitis, and provided areas under the roc curve larger than 0.5. the total pathogen burden comprising all five species  associated with periodontitis with an area of 0.821 (95% ci, 0.758-0.885, p50.001). our prominently sensitive and specific assay may have major importance  in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of periodontitis.

TI  == proteomic analysis of endodontic infections by liquid chromatography-tandem mass  spectrometry.
AB  == introduction: endodontic infections are very prevalent and have a polymicrobial etiology characterized by complex interrelationships between endodontic microorganisms and the host defenses. proteomic analysis of endodontic infections can provide global insights into the invasion, pathogenicity mechanisms, and multifactorial interactions existing between root canal bacteria and the host in  the initiation and progression of apical periodontitis. the purpose of this study was to apply proteomic techniques such as liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (lc-ms/ms) for the identification of proteins of bacterial origin present in endodontic infections. methods: endodontic specimens were aseptically  obtained from seven patients with root canal infections. protein mixtures were subjected to tryptic in-solution digestion and analysed by reverse-phase nano-lc-ms/ms followed by a database search. results: proteins, mainly of cell wall or membrane origin, from endodontic bacteria especially enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and treponema denticola were identified from all the samples tested. identified proteins included adhesins, autolysins, proteases, virulence factors,  and antibiotic-resistance proteins. conclusions: lc-ms/ms offers a sensitive analytical platform to study the disease processes in the root canal environment. the array of proteins expressed in endodontic infections reflects the complex microbial presence and highlights the bacterial species involved in the inflammatory process.

TI  == clinical effectiveness of photodynamic therapy in the treatment of periodontitis.
AB  == aim: a randomized-controlled clinical pilot trial was designed to evaluate photodynamic therapy (pdt) for its bactericidal potential and clinical effect in  the treatment of periodontitis. material and methods: fifty-eight subjects with chronic periodontitis were included. each subject exhibited at least three active periodontal pockets 5mm or deeper, bleeding on probing and the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis. subjects were randomly assigned to a control group treated by subgingival ultrasound only or to a study group additionally treated by pdt. baseline clinical values of gingival index, bleeding on probing, probing  pocket depths and clinical attachment levels were recorded and re-evaluated 90 days later. pathogen screening for p. gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola was conducted at baseline as well as 10, 42 and 90 days after treatment. results: p. gingivalis was significantly reduced in both groups (laser group: p=0.020; control group: p=0.042). no significant reductions of t. forsythia and t. denticola were observed in either group. for the microbial parameters, no significant difference was found between the laser and the control group. all clinical parameters were significantly reduced in both groups after treatment. the mean probing pocket depths decreased from 5.79 to 4.55mm in the laser group and from 5.54 to 4.51 in the control group. the intergroup difference was not significant (p=0.82). bleeding on probing was reduced from 100% evaluated at baseline to 47% in the laser group and 59% in the control group. the intergroup difference was not significant (p=0.28). no significant differences were observed in any other parameters. conclusion: application of a single cycle  of pdt was not effective as an adjunct to ultrasonic periodontal treatment. there were no extra reductions in pocket depths and bleeding on probing. with regard to eradicating bacteria, however, there are no additional effects as compared with conventional treatment alone.

TI  == major proteins and antigens of treponema denticola.
AB  == treponema denticola is a gram-negative, motile, asaccharolytic, anaerobic spirochaete which along with porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia has been shown to form a bacterial consortium called the red complex that is strongly associated with the clinical progression of chronic periodontitis. t. denticola was grown in continuous culture in a complex medium with a mean generation time of 15.75 h. samples from two different membrane-enriched preparations and a cytoplasm-enriched preparation were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and the proteins identified by maldi-tof/tof  mass spectrometry. in total, 219 non-redundant proteins were identified including numerous virulence factors, lipoproteins, abc transporter proteins and enzymes involved in the metabolism of nine different amino acids of which glycine seems to be of particular importance. novel findings include the identification of several abundant peptide uptake systems, and the identification of three flagellar filament outer layer proteins. two-dimensional western blot analysis using sera from mice immunized with formalin-killed t. denticola cells suggested  that msp, prca, oppa, oppa10, mglb, tmpc and several flagellar filament proteins  are antigenic.

TI  == interleukin-2 -330 and 166 gene polymorphisms in relation to aggressive or chronic periodontitis and the presence of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == background and objective: as a pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-2 mediates  the activation, growth and differentiation of t and b lymphocytes and natural killer cells. promoter polymorphisms of the interleukin-2 gene have been associated with altered interleukin-2 production or identified as prognostic markers for various infectious diseases. therefore, the aim of this study was to  evaluate two polymorphisms at positions -330 t/g and 166 g/t in patients with generalized chronic periodontitis (n = 58) or generalized aggressive periodontitis (n = 73) in comparison with periodontitis-free controls (n = 69). material and methods: both interleukin-2 polymorphisms were analyzed using the polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers. distributions of single alleles, genotypes and haplotypes were calculated using the chi-square test. risk factor analyses were carried out by logistic regression with respect to established cofactors for periodontitis. the presence of subgingival bacteria in  an individual were analyzed using a molecular biological method (the micro-ident  test). results: the interleukin-2 genotype -330 tg occurred less frequently in patients with chronic periodontitis (25.9% vs. 49.3%). moreover, this genotype decreased the adjusted odds ratio for chronic periodontitis (odds ratio = 0.394), whereas the interleukin-2 genotype 166 tt and the haplotype combination interleukin-2 -330,166 tt : tt were associated with an increased adjusted odds ratio (odds ratio = 2.82 or 2.97). for the latter interleukin-2 combination, a positive association for the subgingival presence of porphyromonas gingivalis (81.3% vs. 59.5%) and bacteria of the 'red complex' (78.1% vs. 56.0%) was shown.  conclusion: the interleukin-2 genotypes -330 tg and 166 tt, as well as the combination genotype interleukin-2 tt : tt, could be putative prognostic factors  for chronic periodontitis.

TI  == the use of perioscan as a potential screening test for mothers at risk for delivery of pre-term and low birth-weight infants.
AB  == increased levels of oestrogen and progesterone during pregnancy may lead to periodontal disease. the anaerobic gram-negative bacteria classified as the "red  complex" (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) are frequently associated with periodontal disease. periodontopathogens produce toxins and enzymes that can enter the bloodstream and cross the placenta to harm  the foetus. the response of the mother's immune system to infection by these periodontopathogens brings about the release of inflammatory mediators which may  trigger preterm labour or result in low birth-weight infants. the purpose of this study was to examine the use of perioscan as a potential screening test for mothers at risk for pre-term delivery of low birth weight infants due to periodontal disease. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from pregnant women between the ages of 17 to 45 years attending an ante-natal clinic in the western  cape in south africa. plaque samples were analyzed by the enzymatic perioscan test for detection of the red complex in 372 sites from 66 women. results were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) detection of the three species of the red complex. seventeen (25.75%) of the population group tested positive with  perioscan but only 27 (7.25%) of the 372 sites were positive. of the 66 mothers examined, we managed to retrieve 29 records post-delivery. in all the mothers examined, perioscan results showed an association with the indices used to diagnose periodontal disease, and could also be associated with preterm delivery  of low birth-weight infants in two of the 29 maternal records recovered.

TI  == role of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in glutathione catabolism.
AB  == introduction: our previous studies demonstrated that three enzymes, gamma-glutamyltransferase (ggt), cysteinylglycinase (cgase) and cystalysin, are required for the catabolism of glutathione to produce hydrogen sulfide (h(2)s) in treponema denticola. in this study, we examined glutathione catabolism in aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. methods: the ggt and cgase of a. actinomycetemcomitans were determined by biological methods and ggt was characterized using a molecular biological approach. results: a. actinomycetemcomitans showed ggt and cgase activity, but could not produce h(2)s  from glutathione. the addition of recombinant t. denticola cystalysin, an l-cysteine desulfhydrase, to whole cells of a. actinomycetemcomitans resulted in  the production of h(2)s from glutathione. subsequently, we cloned a. actinomycetemcomitans ggt gene (ggt) and overexpressed the 63 kda ggt protein. the recombinant a. actinomycetemcomitans ggt was purified and identified. the k(cat)/k(m) of the recombinant ggt from n-gamma-l-glutamyl-4-nitroaniline as substrate was 31/microm/min. the activity of ggt was optimum at ph 6.9-7.1 and enhanced by thiol-containing compounds. conclusion: the results demonstrated that a. actinomycetemcomitans had ggt and cgase activities and that the ggt was characterized. the possible role of a. actinomycetemcomitans in glutathione metabolism and h(2)s production from oral bacteria was discussed.

AB  == introduction: knowledge of the early oral colonization patterns could provide a better understanding of oral biofilm development and disease initiation that in turn could be the basis for early preventive programmes. methods: microbial samples were collected from five different oral habitats from a total of 93 children (age 3-12 years), attending the dental school of the university of athens, who were split into three age groups. a total of 38 microbial species were sought out by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: all of the test species, except parvimonas micra and porphyromonas gingivalis, differed significantly among sample locations providing quite distinct microbial  profiles for the different oral surfaces. supragingival and subgingival plaque had similar profiles and exhibited higher proportions of actinomyces species and  green complex while soft tissue samples were dominated by streptococci of the yellow complex. the profiles of the tongue dorsum and saliva were also similar. many of the species were in similar proportions in all three age groups for a given location. periodontal pathogens showed increases in proportions with increasing age. specifically, the red complex species (tannerella forsythia, p. gingivalis, treponema denticola) showed a significant increase in proportion with age (p < 0.05) in all sample locations. conclusions: the results showed a pattern of colonization in children similar to that previously found in adults. differences in the profile between age groups suggest a gradual maturation of the oral microbiota, with it being made up of an increasing number of orange and red  complex species.

TI  == are putative periodontal pathogens reliable diagnostic markers?
AB  == periodontitis is one of the most common chronic inflammatory diseases. a number of putative bacterial pathogens have been associated with the disease and are used as diagnostic markers. in the present study, we compared the prevalence of oral bacterial species in the subgingival biofilm of generalized aggressive periodontitis (gap) (n = 44) and chronic periodontitis (cp) (n = 46) patients with that of a periodontitis-resistant control group (pr) (n = 21). the control group consisted of subjects at least 65 years of age with only minimal or no periodontitis and no history of periodontal treatment. a total of 555 samples from 111 subjects were included in this study. the samples were analyzed by pcr of 16s rrna gene fragments and subsequent dot blot hybridization using oligonucleotide probes specific for aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, a treponema denticola-like phylogroup (treponema phylogroup ii), treponema lecithinolyticum, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium spp., and fusobacterium nucleatum, as well as capnocytophaga ochracea. our data confirm a high prevalence of the putative periodontal pathogens p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and t. forsythia in the periodontitis groups. however, these species  were also frequently detected in the pr group. for most of the species tested, the prevalence was more associated with increased probing depth than with the subject group. t. lecithinolyticum was the only periodontopathogenic species showing significant differences both between gap and cp patients and between gap  patients and pr subjects. c. ochracea was associated with the pr subjects, regardless of the probing depth. these results indicate that t. lecithinolyticum  may be a diagnostic marker for gap and c. ochracea for periodontal health. they also suggest that current presumptions of the association of specific bacteria with periodontal health and disease require further evaluation.

TI  == red bacterial complex is associated with the severity of chronic periodontitis in a thai population.
AB  == background: the distribution of periodontal pathogens differs in various geographic locations and racial/ethnic groups. this study investigated the microbiological features of chronic periodontitis (cp) patients in thailand. methods: subgingival plaque samples from 20 non-periodontitis subjects, 20 patients with mild cp, and 20 patients with moderate to severe cp were examined using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to identify porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. results: in the moderate to severe cp patients, there was  high prevalence of p. gingivalis (95%), t. forsythia (95%), t. denticola (80%), as well as the red complex (coexistence of all three species at the same lesion)  (75%). a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in only 35% of the patients in this  study group. p. gingivalis was detected in as high as 45% of the non-periodontitis controls. cp and disease severity were significantly related to the presence of t. forsythia together with t. denticola and the red complex. the  red complex was not found in any non-periodontitis site. conclusion: red complex  bacteria were predominant periodontal pathogens of the moderate to severe form of cp in this thai population. the presence of t. forsythia together with t. denticola, and the red complex species at the same site were significantly associated with the disease severity.

TI  == serum antibodies to periodontal bacteria as diagnostic markers of periodontitis.
AB  == background: assessment of periodontal conditions in epidemiologic studies usually requires a clinical examination, which is resource-intensive. we investigated the ability of serum immunoglobulin g (igg) antibodies to periodontal bacteria to reflect clinical periodontal status. methods: we used checkerboard immunoblotting to assess serum igg levels to 19 species, including established/putative periodontal pathogens and non-pathogenic bacteria, in 5,747 dentate adults aged > or = 40 years who participated in the third national health and nutrition examination survey between 1988 and 1994. three earlier described alternative definitions of periodontitis were used, based on specific combinations of probing depth and attachment level values. optimized elevated titer thresholds and corresponding sensitivities and specificities were calculated for each definition. titers significantly associated with periodontitis were identified in univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. parsimonious models were subsequently developed using age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, smoking, and diagnosed diabetes. results: in unadjusted models, high titers to porphyromonas gingivalis were most strongly associated with periodontitis across  all definitions (odds ratio, 2.07 to 2.74; p <0.05). in parsimonious models including demographic data, smoking, and diagnosed diabetes, high p. gingivalis titers were consistently associated with periodontitis, whereas high eubacterium  nodatum titers were associated with periodontal health in two of three definitions. receiver operating characteristic curves for the parsimonious multivariable models showed that the area under the curve ranged between 0.72 and 0.78. conclusions: serum igg titers to selected periodontal species, combined with demographic and behavioral characteristics, resulted in a moderately accurate classification of periodontal status in epidemiologic studies. the external validity of these findings must be examined further.

TI  == a review of dental implants and infection.
AB  == dental implants have become increasingly common for the management of tooth loss. despite their placement in a contaminated surgical field, success rates are relatively high. this article reviews dental implants and highlights factors leading to infection and potential implant failure. a literature search identified studies analysing the microbial composition of peri-implant infections. the microflora of dental peri-implantitis resembles that found in chronic periodontitis, featuring predominantly anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, in particular porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia, anaerobic gram-negative cocci such as veillonella spp. and spirochaetes including treponema denticola. the role of staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci that are typically encountered in orthopaedic infections is debatable, although they undoubtedly play a role when isolated from clinically infected sites. likewise, the aetiological involvement of coliforms and candida spp. requires further longitudinal studies. currently, there are neither standardised antibiotic prophylactic regimens for dental implant placement nor universally accepted treatment for peri-implantitis. the treatment of infected implants is difficult and usually requires removal. in the uk there is no systematic post-surgical implant surveillance programme. therefore, the development of such  a project would be advisable and provide valuable epidemiological data.

TI  == identification of pathogen and host-response markers correlated with periodontal  disease.
AB  == background: periodontitis is the major cause of tooth loss in adults and is linked to systemic illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease and stroke. the development of rapid point-of-care (poc) chairside diagnostics has the potential  for the early detection of periodontal infection and progression to identify incipient disease and reduce health care costs. however, validation of effective  diagnostics requires the identification and verification of biomarkers correlated with disease progression. this clinical study sought to determine the ability of  putative host- and microbially derived biomarkers to identify periodontal disease status from whole saliva and plaque biofilm. methods: one hundred human subjects  were equally recruited into a healthy/gingivitis group or a periodontitis population. whole saliva was collected from all subjects and analyzed using antibody arrays to measure the levels of multiple proinflammatory cytokines and bone resorptive/turnover markers. results: salivary biomarker data were correlated to comprehensive clinical, radiographic, and microbial plaque biofilm  levels measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) for the generation of models for periodontal disease identification. significantly elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinase (mmp)-8 and -9 were found in subjects with advanced periodontitis with random forest importance scores of 7.1 and 5.1,  respectively. the generation of receiver operating characteristic curves demonstrated that permutations of salivary biomarkers and pathogen biofilm values augmented the prediction of disease category. multiple combinations of salivary biomarkers (especially mmp-8 and -9 and osteoprotegerin) combined with red-complex anaerobic periodontal pathogens (such as porphyromonas gingivalis or  treponema denticola) provided highly accurate predictions of periodontal disease  category. elevated salivary mmp-8 and t. denticola biofilm levels displayed robust combinatorial characteristics in predicting periodontal disease severity (area under the curve = 0.88; odds ratio = 24.6; 95% confidence interval: 5.2 to  116.5). conclusions: using qpcr and sensitive immunoassays, we identified host- and bacterially derived biomarkers correlated with periodontal disease. this approach offers significant potential for the discovery of biomarker signatures useful in the development of rapid poc chairside diagnostics for oral and systemic diseases. studies are ongoing to apply this approach to the longitudinal predictions of disease activity.

TI  == bacterial profiles of oral streptococcal and periodontal bacterial species in saliva specimens from japanese subjects.
AB  == objective: recent developments in molecular biological techniques have increased  understanding of the distribution of oral bacterial species in clinical specimens, though few investigations have been conducted to simultaneously detect oral streptococcal and periodontal species in the same specimens. the purpose of  the present study was to investigate the distribution and correlation of 6 oral streptococcal and 6 periodontal species in saliva specimens taken from children and their mothers. design: seventy-four pairs of children and their mothers were  approved to participate in this study. saliva specimens were collected and bacterial dna extracted, which was subjected to pcr analyses using species-specific sets of primers. the combinations of species able to be detected simultaneously were determined by statistical analyses. results: streptococcus sobrinus and porphyromonas gingivalis were detected more often in the mothers than the children. streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis, and streptococcus oralis were detected simultaneously in a significant number of specimens, while the presence of campylobacter rectus was correlated with the presence of at least one of the red complex species (p. gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythensis). on the other hand, no correlation was shown between the rates of detection of oral streptococcal and periodontal species. conclusions: our results indicate that among streptococcal and periodontal species, several are able to coexist in saliva, while the presence of both does not have an influence on each other.

TI  == does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  == background: we investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. methods: bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4  to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6  weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (bop) was recorded at sites sampled at  the four time points. results: the mean bop at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. the corresponding mean bop at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (p  <0.01). increased bacterial counts over time were found for neisseria mucosa (p <0.001). lower counts (p <0.001) were found for capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, leptotrichia buccalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. no changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola did not change. counts of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (p <0.001). conclusions: subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia counts were associated with bop at week 12. a decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. only counts of n. mucosa increased.

TI  == tannerella forsythia and the hla-dqb1 allele are associated with susceptibility to periodontal disease in japanese adolescents.
AB  == periodontal disease is a multiple factor disease caused by genetic factors, environmental factors, and periodontal bacteria (periodontal pathogens). the present study aimed to elucidate the risk factors for periodontal disease in japanese adolescents. subjects (11-16 years old) were classified into three groups: localized aggressive periodontitis (lap), periodontal attachment loss (pal), and periodontally healthy (ph) groups. genomic dna isolated from the buccal mucosa was used for single-nucleotide polymorphism analyses of the candidate genes (interleukin-1alpha-889; interleukin-1alpha +4845; interleukin-1beta +3954; an immunoglobulin g fc gamma receptor, fcgammariia-r/h131; and a human leukocyte antigen class ii allele, hla-dqb1) of aggressive periodontitis. subgingival plaque samples obtained from the same subjects were used for 16s rrnabased polymerase chain reaction analysis of five important periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia). tannerella forsythia was detected in the deepest periodontal pockets in all subjects in the lap and pal groups. the prevalence of  an atypical bamhi restriction site in hla-dqb1 of the lap group was significantly higher than that in the ph and pal groups. furthermore, all subjects who had the  atypical bamhi restriction site in hla-dqb1 had t. forsythia infection. these results suggested that t. forsythia is associated with periodontal disease in japanese adolescents and also suggested that hla-dqb1 is related to lap and is associated with t. forsythia infection.

TI  == salivary detection of periodontopathic bacteria and periodontal health status in  dental students.
AB  == objective: saliva may become a potential source of contamination through vertical and horizontal transmissions as well as cross-infections. this study aims to use  saliva as a screening tool to detect putative periodontal pathogens in a young population with fairly good oral hygiene. materials and methods: stimulated saliva samples were obtained from 134 dental students (20.5+/-1 years, range 18-22 years). among those, 77 subjects also completed a periodontal examination including attachment loss, modified dental, gingival and plaque indices (al, mdi, gi and pi). the test bacteria were identified using a 16s rrna-based pcr detection method. results: one or more of the test bacteria was found in 67% of the subjects. prevotella nigrescens was detected as single bacterium in 16% of the subjects followed by treponema denticola (4%), porphyromonas gingivalis (2%), aggregatibacter (formerly actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans (1%) and tannerella forsythia (1%). two or more pathogens were detected in 42% of the subjects. clinical examination revealed health with no attachment loss (al) in 84% of the students. in no al group, 38% of the students were pathogen free while this was 25% for students in localized al group (p>0.05). there was a statistically significant association between the detection of salivary periodontal pathogen in general and higher pi (p=0.018) and gi (p=0.043). conclusion: within the limits of this study, it is possible to detect all six periodontal pathogens in the saliva of dental students. although a correlation can be observed between the presence of salivary periodontal pathogen and clinical signs of inflammation such as plaque accumulation and gingival bleeding, detection of specific bacteria in saliva is not related to the presence of localized al based on the presented study population.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis with either tannerella forsythia or treponema denticola  induces synergistic il-6 production by murine macrophage-like j774.1 cells.
AB  == background: chronic periodontitis is caused by mixed bacterial infection. porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola are frequently detected in deep periodontal pockets. we demonstrate that these bacteria induce proinflammatory cytokine production by the mouse macrophage-like  cell line j774.1. materials and methods: j774.1 cells were incubated with and without bacteria for 24h in 96-well flat-bottomed plates. the culture supernatants were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for secreted mouse interleukin (il)-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, il-23, il-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. the cytokine concentrations were determined using a standard curve prepared for each assay. results: mixed infection with p.  gingivalis and either t. forsythia or t. denticola at 10(5)cfu/ml acted synergistically to increase il-6 production, but not monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, il-23, il-1 beta or tumor necrosis factor-alpha production. gingipain  inhibitors kyt-1 and kyt-36 inhibited il-6 production by j774.1 cells incubated with 10(5)cfu/ml of mixed bacteria. conclusion: these results suggest that p. gingivalis with either t. forsythia or t. denticola directly induces synergistic  il-6 protein production and that gingipains play a role in this synergistic effect.

TI  == periodontal pathogen levels in adolescents before, during, and after fixed orthodontic appliance therapy.
AB  == introduction: this purpose of this study was to document and investigate changes  in periodontal pathogen levels before, during, and after orthodontic treatment in adolescents. methods: dna gene probe analysis was used to quantify the levels of  8 periodontal pathogens before, during, and after treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances in 190 concurrently treated adolescent orthodontic patients. the 8 pathogens examined were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), tannerella forsythia (tf), eikenella corrodens (ec), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), treponema denticola (td), and campylobacter rectus (cr). chi-square tests were used to determine whether the percentages of subjects with high counts significantly changed over time. logistic regression analyses were also performed to derive the relative risk of higher counts of pathogenic bacteria with fixed appliances at the various time intervals studied. results: for 6 (pi, tf, ec, fn, td, cr) of the 8 pathogens, the percentages of subjects with high pathogen counts increased  significantly after 6 months of fixed appliance treatment, but these returned to  pretreatment levels by 12 months of orthodontic treatment. no pathogen level was  significantly higher after 12 months of orthodontic treatment, and orthodontic treatment was found to be significantly protective for half of the pathogens (ec, fn, td, cr) posttreatment. conclusions: orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances does not increase the risk of high levels of these periodontal pathogens.

TI  == detection of oral bacteria in cardiovascular specimens.
AB  == background/aims: oral bacteria, including cariogenic and periodontal pathogens, are thought to be etiological factors in the development of cardiovascular diseases. to define this relationship, we analyzed the distribution of oral bacterial species in cardiovascular specimens. method: following acceptance into  the study, 203 consecutive patients were analyzed, from whom 82 aortic valve specimens, 35 mitral valve specimens, and 86 aortic aneurysmal wall specimens, of which 16 contained aneurysmal thrombus tissues, were obtained. in addition, a total of 58 dental plaque specimens were collected from the same group of patients who underwent heart valve replacement or removal of aortic aneurysms. bacterial dna was extracted from both cardiovascular tissues and dental plaque in those cases and then species-specific polymerase chain reaction assays were used  to analyze the occurrences of six oral streptococcal and six periodontal bacterial species. results: streptococcus mutans was the most frequently detected species in the cardiovascular specimens, followed by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. as for dental plaque specimens from patients who underwent cardiovascular operations, most of the tested periodontitis-related species as well as oral streptococci were detected at high frequencies. furthermore, the positive rate of s. mutans in cardiovascular specimens from patients whose dental plaque specimens were also positive for s. mutans was 78%, which was significantly higher than any other tested species when the same analysis was performed. conclusion: our results suggest that specific oral bacterial species,  such as s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans, are related to bacteremia and may be etiologic factors for the development of cardiovascular diseases.

TI  == toll-like receptors 2 and 5 in human gingival epithelial cells co-operate with t-cell cytokine interleukin-17.
AB  == background/aim: periodontitis begins as the result of perturbation of the gingival epithelial cells caused by subgingival bacteria interacting with the epithelial cells via pattern recognition receptors. toll-like receptors (tlrs) have been shown to play an important role in the recognition of periodontal pathogens so we have studied the interaction of tlr ligands with tlr2 and tlr5 for cytokine production in the cultures of gingival epithelial cells. methods: immunohistochemistry was used for the localization of tlr2 and tlr5 in tissue specimens. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed to detect the levels of interleukin-1beta (il-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha), released from gingival epithelial cell cultures following stimulation with tlr ligand alone or in combination with il-17. results: both tlr2 and tlr5 were increased in periodontitis (2128 +/- 159 vs. 449 +/- 59 and 2456 +/- 297 vs. 679  +/- 103, respectively, p < 0.001) including gingival epithelial cells that stained strongly. cultured gingival epithelial cells stimulated with their respective ligands (hklm, a tlr2 ligand that is also found in porphyromonas gingivalis, and flagellin, a tlr5 ligand that is also found in treponema denticola) produced both il-1beta and tnf-alpha. to mimic t-cell help, il-17 was  added. this further greatly enhanced tlr ligand-induced il-1beta (p < 0.001) and  tnf-alpha (p < 0.01) production. conclusions: these findings show how pathogen-associated molecular patterns, shared by many different periodontopathogenic bacteria, stimulate the resident gingival epithelial cells to inflammatory responses in a tlr-dependent manner. this stimulation may be particularly strong in periodontitis and when t helper type 17 cells provide t-cell help in intercellular cooperation.

TI  == tumor necrosis factor-alpha -308g/a single nucleotide polymorphism and red-complex periodontopathogens are independently associated with increased levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in diseased periodontal tissues.
AB  == background and objective: inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha are involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. a high between-subject variation in the level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha mrna has been verified, which may be a result of genetic polymorphisms and/or the presence of periodontopathogens such as porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola (called the red complex) and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. in this study, we investigated the effect of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnfa) -308g/a gene polymorphism and of periodontopathogens on the tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels in the periodontal tissues of nonsmoking patients with chronic periodontitis (n = 127) and in control subjects  (n = 177). material and methods: the tnfa -308g/a single nucleotide polymorphism  was investigated using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, whereas the tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels and the periodontopathogen load were determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: no statistically significant differences were found in the frequency of the tnfa -308 single nucleotide polymorphism in control and chronic  periodontitis groups, in spite of the higher frequency of the a allele in the chronic periodontitis group. the concomitant analyses of genotypes and periodontopathogens demonstrated that tnfa -308 ga/aa genotypes and the red-complex periodontopathogens were independently associated with increased levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in periodontal tissues, and no additive effect was seen when both factors were present. p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and t. denticola counts were positively correlated with the level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha. tnfa -308 genotypes were not associated with the periodontopathogen detection odds or with the bacterial load. conclusion: our results demonstrate that the tnfa -308 a allele and red-complex periodontopathogens are independently associated with increased levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in diseased tissues of nonsmoking chronic periodontitis patients and consequently are potentially involved in determining the disease outcome.

TI  == [identification of periodontopathogen microorganisms by pcr technique].
AB  == introduction: periodontitis is an inflammatory disease of the supporting tissues  of teeth and is a major cause of tooth loss in adults. the onset and progression  of periodontal disease is attributed to the presence of elevated levels of a consortium of pathogenic bacteria. gram negative bacteria, mainly strict anaerobes, play the major role. objective: the present study aimed to assess the  presence of the main types of microorganisms involved in the aetiopathogenesis of periodontal disease: porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, treponema denticola, tanerella forsythia and prevotella intermedia in different samples collected from the oral  cavity of 90 patients diagnosed with periodontitis. method: bacterial dna detection was performed in diverse biological materials, namely in dental plaque, gingival tissue and saliva, by means of multiplex pcr, a technique that allows simultaneous identification of two different bacterial genomes. results: in the dental plaque of the periodontitis patients, treponema denticola dominated. in the gingival tissue, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were the microbiota most frequently detected, whilst in saliva treponema denticola and eikenella corrodens were found with the highest percentage. conclusion: the identification of microorganisms by multiplex pcr is specific and sensitive. rapid and precise assessment of different types of periodontopathogens is extremely important for early detection of the infection and consequently for the prevention and treatment of periodontal disease. in everyday clinical practice, for routine bacterial evaluation in patients with periodontal disease, the dental plaque is the most suitable biological material, because it is the richest in periodontal bacteria.

AB  == purpose: the goal of this study was to characterize the microbiological profile in samples of subgingival plaque taken from periodontal patients with different ethnic origin. methods: 178 patients (n=90 from south korea and n=88 from germany; age: 45.4 +/- 10.4 years) were diagnosed with severe generalized periodontitis. in all patients the deepest pocket of each quadrant was sampled for subgingival plaque. the four samples per patient were pooled and subsequently analysed with a 16s-rna-gene probe test. results: prevalence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was significantly higher in german patients (47.7%) compared to korean patients (26.7%) (p < 0.01, chi(2)-test). for tannerella forsythia and porphyromonas gingivalis, differences between germans and koreans were not as pronounced. a statistically significant difference could also be found for treponema denticola (germans: 95.5%, koreans: 81.1%, p < 0.01, chi(2)-test). after logarithmic transformation, bacterial counts differed for all microorganisms under investigation between germans and koreans, even after using  a general linear model/analysis of covariance (glm/ancova) to adjust for gender,  age, smoking status, pocket probing depths (ppd) of sampled teeth, and gingival bleeding index (gbi). conclusion: depending on their ethnic origin, the microbiological profile of pooled subgingival plaque sample seems to differ significantly between patients of caucasian and asian ethnic origin.

TI  == coaggregation of treponema denticola with porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum is mediated by the major outer sheath protein of treponema denticola.
AB  == coagreggation of treponema denticola with either porphyromonas gingivalis or fusobacterium nucleatum was characterized and the role of the major outer sheath  protein (msp) in the coaggregation process of these bacteria was evaluated. the msp of t. denticola was found to be able to bind to p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum cells and this binding could be inhibited by msp in a concentration-dependent manner. while sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and periodic acid-schiff (pas) staining of msp revealed that it is a glycoprotein, monosaccharide analysis showed that msp contains: glc (44.4),  gal (20.4%) glcn (1.3%), galn (31.6%) and fuc (9.2%). peptide n-glycosidase f deglycosylation of msp was found to inhibit its binding to f. nucleatum but not to p. gingivalis cells. sugar-binding studies showed that the requirements for the binding of both t. denticola and msp to f. nucleatum cells are similar to those of the f. nucleatum galactose-binding lectin. these data suggest that msp acts as an adhesin during the coaggregation process of t. denticola with p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum through its protein and carbohydrate moieties, respectively.

TI  == persistence of extracrevicular bacterial reservoirs after treatment of aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that periodontal pathogens associated with aggressive periodontitis persist in extracrevicular locations following scaling and root planing, systemic antibiotics, and antimicrobial rinses. methods: eighteen patients with aggressive periodontitis received a clinical examination during which samples of subgingival plaque and buccal epithelial cells were obtained. treatment consisted of full-mouth root planing, systemic antibiotics, and chlorhexidine rinses. clinical measurements and sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. quantitative polymerase chain reaction determined the number of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola in the plaque. fluorescence in situ hybridization and confocal microscopy determined the extent of intracellular invasion in epithelial cells. results: clinical measurements improved significantly following treatment. all bacterial species except p. gingivalis were significantly reduced in plaque between baseline and 3 months. however, all species showed a trend to repopulate  between 3 and 6 months. this increase was statistically significant for log t. denticola counts. all species were detected intracellularly. the percentage of cells infected intracellularly was not affected by therapy. conclusions: the 6-month increasing trend in the levels of plaque bacteria suggests that subgingival recolonization was occurring. because the presence of these species within epithelial cells was not altered after treatment, it is plausible that recolonization may occur from the oral mucosa. systemic antibiotics and topical chlorhexidine did not reduce the percentage of invaded epithelial cells. these data support the hypothesis that extracrevicular reservoirs of bacteria exist, which might contribute to recurrent or refractory disease in some patients.

TI  == [relationship of putative periodontopathogenic bacteria and drug-induced gingival overgrowth].
AB  == objective: to investigate the effect of putative periodontopathogenic bacteria on the development of drug-induced gingival overgrowth (go) in renal transplant recipients. methods: a total of 57 patients undergoing cyclosporine treatment were divided into two groups according to go index: with gingival overgrowth (group a) and without gingival overgrowth (group b). demographic, pharmacologic and periodontal data were analyzed. the real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method was used to detect and quantify five putative periodontopathogenic bacteria, including porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), prevotella intermedia (pi), treponema denticola (td)  and tannerella forsythia (tf) in subgingival samples. moreover, the relationship  between the bacterial amount and the severity of go was analyzed. results: group  a presented a significantly higher plaque index, sulcus bleeding index and probing depth than group b (p < 0.01). the occurrences of pg, td, and tf in the group a (96%, 82% and 89%) were significantly increased compared with those in the group b (69%, 55% and 66%, p < 0. 05), respectively. the prevalence of pg, td, and tf in the group a (79%) was markedly higher than that in the group b (38%, p < 0.01). the bacterial amount of pg, td, tf and pi were enhanced along with the severity of go. however, the bacterial amount of aa had no difference between two groups. conclusions: pg, td, and tf may have a significant relationship with the development of go.

TI  == detection of helicobacter pylori dna in the saliva of patients complaining of halitosis.
AB  == helicobacter pylori infection, which causes peptic ulcers and gastric cancer, is  considered a possible cause of halitosis. recently, the oral cavity was identified as a possible h. pylori reservoir, particularly in the presence of periodontal disease, which is a cause of halitosis. the purpose of this study was to evaluate by pcr the prevalence of oral h. pylori in the saliva of subjects complaining of halitosis. samples were obtained from 326 non-dyspeptic subjects,  comprising 251 subjects with actual malodour and 75 subjects without halitosis. dna was extracted from the samples, and the presence of h. pylori and periodontopathic bacteria including porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and prevotella intermedia was examined by pcr. h. pylori was detected in 21 (6.4  %) of 326 samples. the methyl mercaptan concentration and periodontal parameters  including tooth mobility, periodontal pocket depth (ppd) and occult blood in the  saliva were significantly greater in the h. pylori-positive subjects. each of the periodontopathic bacteria was also detected at a significantly higher frequency in the h. pylori-positive subjects. among those patients with a ppd of > or =5 mm and a tongue coating score of < or =2, no difference was observed in oral malodour levels between the h. pylori-positive and -negative subjects. however, the presence of occult blood in the saliva and the prevalence of prevotella intermedia were significantly greater in the h. pylori-positive subjects. h. pylori was detected in 16 (15.7 %) of 102 subjects with periodontitis, suggesting that progression of periodontal pocket and inflammation may favour colonization by this species and that h. pylori infection may be indirectly associated with oral pathological halitosis following periodontitis.

TI  == free soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappab ligand in gingival crevicular fluid correlates with distinct pathogens in periodontitis patients.
AB  == aim: the aim of the experiment was to investigate the levels of free soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor-kb ligand (srankl) in periodontal health and disease and their correlations to clinical parameters and important periodontal pathogens. material and methods: chronic periodontitis (n=35) and periodontally healthy (n=38) subjects participated in the present study. pocket depth, recession and bleeding index were recorded at a total of 221 sites. subgingival plaque samples from these sites were analysed for the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola. gingival crevicular fluid samples were analysed with elisa for levels of free srankl. comparisons between groups were performed by applying  non-parametric tests (mann-whitney) and correlations among parameters were sought for with spearman's r coefficient. results: mean levels of free srankl were higher in periodontitis subjects and correlated significantly with mean counts of t. denticola on the subject level and p. gingivalis, t. denticola on the site level (spearman's r coefficient, p<0.05), but not with clinical parameters. no correlations were found between the levels of free srankl and investigated parameters in periodontally healthy individuals. no effect of smoking was found on investigated parameters and correlations (univariate analysis of variance and  pairwise comparisons). conclusions: findings from the present study suggest a correlation of levels of srankl with important pathogens in periodontitis patients.

TI  == granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (gcp-2/cxcl6) complements interleukin-8 in periodontal disease.
AB  == background and objective: mucosal inflammatory responses are orchestrated largely by pro-inflammatory chemokines. the chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (cxcl6) is involved in neutrophil recruitment and migration. previous studies have shown that granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 is up-regulated during mucosal  inflammation (e.g. in inflammatory bowel disease), similarly to the functionally  and structurally related chemokine interleukin-8. nevertheless, unlike interleukin-8, a role of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in gingival inflammation has not been yet demonstrated. in this study we aimed to evaluate the expression of the chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in clinically healthy vs. diseased gingival tissues and to explore possible correlations with clinical and microbiological markers of periodontitis. material and methods: gene expression in 184 'diseased' and 63 'healthy' gingival tissue specimens from 90 patients with periodontitis was analyzed using affymetrix u133plus2.0 arrays. the expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 was further confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while the localization of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in gingival tissues was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. plaque samples from the adjacent periodontal pockets were collected and evaluated for 11 species of periodontal bacteria using checkerboard dna-dna hybridizations. results: among all known chemokines, gcp-2 expression was the most up-regulated (3.8-fold, p < 1.1 x 10(-16)), in 'diseased' vs. 'healthy' tissue as compared to  a 2.6-fold increased expression of interleukin-8 mrna (p < 1.2 x 10(-15)). increased expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 correlated with higher  levels of 'red' and 'orange' complex pathogens and with increased probing depth,  but not with attachment loss. immunohistochemistry showed that granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 was expressed in gingival vascular endothelium. conclusion: the level of expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 correlates with the  severity of periodontitis and appears to act as a hitherto unrecognized functional adjunct to interleukin-8 in diseased gingival tissues.

TI  == moxifloxacin as an adjunctive antibiotic in the treatment of severe chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: the impact of moxifloxacin (mox) was analyzed in the treatment of severe chronic periodontitis. methods: in a randomized, prospective, clinical multicenter trial, 92 subjects with severe chronic periodontitis were treated with scaling and root planing (srp) alone (control group; n = 21), srp plus adjunctive doxycycline (dox group; n = 36), or srp plus adjunctive mox (mox group; n = 35). probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months after non-surgical periodontal treatment. the load of periodontopathogens, the level of interleukin-8, and the activities of granulocyte elastase and myeloperoxidase were also measured. results: all three procedures led to significant reductions in pd, cal, and bop. pd reduction was significantly greater (p <0.05) in the mox  group (2.46 +/- 1.17 mm at 6 months and 2.84 +/- 1.53 mm at 12 months) compared to the dox group (1.85 +/- 1.24 mm and 2.19 +/- 1.13 mm at 6 and 12 months, respectively) and the controls (1.77 +/- 0.57 mm and 1.86 +/- 0.56 mm at 6 and 12 months, respectively). only in the mox group was the load of all investigated bacteria and all inflammatory parameters reduced at each appointment compared to  baseline. conclusions: the adjunctive application of antibiotics improved the treatment outcome in subjects with severe chronic periodontitis. mox seemed to be more effective than dox and might be an alternative drug in the treatment of periodontal diseases.

TI  == periodontal bacterial profiles in pregnant women: response to treatment and associations with birth outcomes in the obstetrics and periodontal therapy (opt)  study.
AB  == background: a recent clinical trial (obstetrics and periodontal therapy [opt] study) demonstrated that periodontal therapy during pregnancy improved periodontal outcomes but failed to impact preterm birth. the present study evaluated seven target bacteria, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, and fusobacterium nucleatum, in subgingival dental plaque of pregnant women in the opt study and their association with birth outcomes. methods: pregnant women were randomly assigned to receive periodontal treatment before 21 weeks' gestation or after delivery. subgingival plaque was sampled at baseline (13 to 16 weeks; 6 days of gestation)  and at 29 to 32 weeks. we analyzed subgingival plaque samples from women who experienced fetal loss, delivered a live preterm infant (preterm women), or delivered a full-term infant (full-term women). samples were analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. associations between preterm birth and bacterial counts and percentages were tested using multiple linear regression. results: no significant differences were observed at baseline between preterm and full-term women for any measured bacterial species or group of species, after accounting for multiple comparisons. changes in bacterial counts and proportions  during pregnancy also were not associated with birth outcomes. in full-term and preterm women, periodontal therapy significantly reduced (p <0.01) counts of all  target species except for a. actinomycetemcomitans. conclusions: in pregnant women with periodontitis, non-surgical periodontal therapy significantly reduced  levels of periodontal pathogens. baseline levels of selected periodontal pathogens or changes in these bacteria resulting from therapy were not associated with preterm birth.

TI  == composition of supra- and subgingival biofilm of subjects with healthy and diseased implants.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of this study was to compare the microbial composition of supra- and subgingival biofilm in subjects with and without peri-implantitis. material and methods: forty-four subjects (mean age 48.9 +/- 13.51 years) with at least one implant restored and functional for at least 2 years were assigned to two groups: a peri-implantitis group (n=22), consisting of subjects presenting peri-implant sites with radiographic defects >3 mm, bleeding on probing and/or suppuration; and a control group (n=22), consisting of subjects with healthy implants. the clinical parameters evaluated were plaque index, gingival bleeding, bleeding on probing, suppuration, probing depth and clinical attachment level. supra- and subgingival biofilm samples were taken from the deepest sites of each  implant and analyzed for the presence of 36 microorganisms by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: higher mean counts of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia were observed in the peri-implantitis group, both supra- and subgingivally (p<0.05). the proportions of the pathogens from the red complex were elevated, while host-compatible beneficial microbial complexes were reduced in diseased compared with healthy implants. the microbiological profiles of supra- and subgingival environments did not differ substantially within each group. conclusion: marked differences were observed in the composition of supra- and subgingival biofilm between healthy and diseased implants. the microbiota associated with peri-implantitis was comprised  of more periodontal pathogenic bacterial species, including the supragingival biofilm.

TI  == photodynamic therapy as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment: a randomized, controlled clinical trial.
AB  == background: recent preclinical and clinical data have suggested a potential benefit of photodynamic therapy (pdt) in the treatment of periodontitis. however, there are very limited data from controlled clinical trials evaluating the effect of pdt in the treatment of periodontitis. the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiologic effects of the adjunctive use of pdt to non-surgical periodontal treatment. methods: twenty-four subjects with chronic periodontitis were randomly treated with scaling and root planing followed by a single episode of pdt (test) or scaling and root planing alone (control). full-mouth plaque score (fmps), full-mouth bleeding score (fmbs), probing depth (pd), gingival recession, and clinical attachment level (cal) were measured at baseline and 3 and 6 months after therapy. primary outcome variables were changes in pd and cal. microbiologic evaluation of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans  (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), treponema denticola, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eubacterium nodatum, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga spp. was performed at baseline and 3 and 6 months following therapy by using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test. results: at 3 and 6 months after treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups with regard to cal, pd,  fmps, or microbiologic changes. at 3 and 6 months, a statistically significantly  greater improvement in fmbs was found in the test group. conclusion: the additional application of a single episode of pdt to scaling and root planing failed to result in an additional improvement in terms of pd reduction and cal gain, but it resulted in a significantly higher reduction in bleeding scores compared to scaling and root planing alone.

AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to assess the effects of dental flossing on the microbial composition of interproximal plaque samples in matched  twins. methods: the study was a two-treatment, examiner-masked, randomized, parallel-group, controlled study. fifty-one twin pairs between 12 and 21 years of age were randomized to a 2-week supervised and unsupervised treatment regimen consisting of tongue brushing and toothbrushing or tongue brushing and toothbrushing plus flossing. the reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay was used to assess levels (abundance) of 26 microbial species in interproximal plaque samples collected from six sites per subject. an integrative computational predictive model estimated average changes in microbial abundance patterns of selected bacterial species from baseline to 2 weeks by comparing treatment groups. results: after the 2-week study period, putative periodontal pathogens and cariogenic bacteria were overabundant in the group that did not floss compared to the group that performed flossing. those included treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and streptococcus mutans. microbial species that are not consistent with the development of periodontal disease or dental caries were overabundant in the group that did floss compared to the non-flossing group. conclusion: in a well-matched twin cohort, tooth and tongue brushing plus flossing significantly decreased the abundance of microbial  species associated with periodontal disease and dental caries after a 2-week program.

AB  == purpose: to assess the impact of mechanical debridement (scaling and root planing), without adjunctive therapy, on reducing the numbers of periodontal pathogens detected in pregnant subjects with and without visible third molars. patients and methods: sixty-seven subjects in the second trimester of pregnancy were enrolled in an institutional review board-approved study. full mouth periodontal exams of all teeth were conducted at baseline and postpartum. presence or absence of third molars was noted. subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from the mesiobuccal of all first molars at enrollment and postpartum. subjects' total counts for periodontal pathogens in biofilm samples were determined by dna-dna checkerboard hybridization. we analyzed data from a subsample of 26 subjects. all subjects in the study were treated at enrollment by mechanical debridement of all teeth, including third molars. differences between  subjects' baseline and postpartum demographic and clinical characteristics were analyzed by chi(2) and t tests by presence or absence of third molars. statistical significance for differences in pathogen levels was determined by rank analysis of covariance. significance was set at 0.05 without correction for  multiple comparisons. results: most of the 26 subjects were african american (61%), on medicaid (92%), and did not smoke during pregnancy (88%). the 15 subjects with visible third molars were significantly older (28.0 years [sd 6.4]  vs 23.7 years [sd 3.9]). in the 11 subjects with no third molars noted, all pathogen counts were reduced postpartum. in the 15 subjects with visible third molars, total counts for each pathogen analyzed were higher postpartum as compared with subjects with no visible third molars, and their bacterial counts were increased for 5 of the 8 pathogens, including all "red cluster" pathogens. differences between study groups were observed by the presence or absence of third molars for t. forsythia and p. nigrescens (p = .04), and for p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, total "orange cluster" bacteria, and total pathogens (p < .06). conclusion: the efficacy of mechanical debridement to lower periodontal pathogen  counts during pregnancy was limited by the presence of visible third molars and should be analyzed further in larger scale trials.

TI  == periodontal status of patients with dentin dysplasia type i: report of three cases within a family.
AB  == background: dentin dysplasia type i (ddi) is a rare hereditary disturbance of dentin formation. it is characterized by clinically normal-appearing crowns; obliteration of pulp chambers; and short, blunted and malformed roots that are commonly associated with periodontal attachment loss (pal). in this context, we report three cases within a family with similar clinical and radiographic features of ddi but with differing microbiologic and periodontal conditions. methods: a 42-year-old white female and her two daughters (25 and 10 years of age) presented with a diagnosis of ddi. probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), visible plaque, and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded. subgingival biofilm samples were randomly collected and analyzed by checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization. results: the mother presented 34.9% of sites with pd > or  =4 mm, 41.3% of sites with cal > or =4 mm, and 57% of sites with bop; both daughters presented no sites with pd or cal >3 mm and <10% of sites with bop. microbiologic analysis detected gemella morbillorum, neisseria mucosa, and staphylococcus aureus in > or =50% of the mother's samples. the daughters showed  high levels (>10(4) bacterial cells) of some periodontopathic bacteria, including members of the red (porphyromonas gingivalis) and orange (fusobacterium periodonticum and f. nucleatum polymorphum) complexes and beneficial species of the yellow (streptococcus gordonii) and purple (veillonella parvula) complexes. the mother presented high mean levels only for four tested species (n. mucosa, prevotella melaninogenica, treponema denticola, and v. parvula). conclusion: a combination of radiographs, microbiologic analysis, and preventive professional monitoring care is important to avoid pal and to provide oral health in patients  with ddi.

TI  == relationship of porphyromonas gingivalis with glycemic level in patients with type 2 diabetes following periodontal treatment.
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to assess the relationship between serum  glycemic levels and subgingival microbial profile alteration following periodontal treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. methods: we studied 30 periodontitis patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who received full-mouth subgingival debridement by analyzing their subgingival microbial profiles using a polymerase chain reaction method at baseline and various time-points for 12 months following treatment. concurrently, probing pocket depth, bleeding on probing, and metabolic parameters, including glycated hemoglobin a1c (hba1c), blood sugar level, c-reactive proteins, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and high-density and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, were recorded. results: periodontal conditions were significantly improved after treatment, and the occurrence rates of periodontal bacterial species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia, were also reduced. interestingly, p. gingivalis was detected more frequently in subjects with increased hba1c values after periodontal treatment than in those patients with decreased hba1c values. furthermore, p. gingivalis with type ii fimbriae was detected only in hba1c-increased subjects, while improvements in hba1c values were observed only in subjects without type ii clones. conclusions: these results suggest that glycemic level in diabetes is affected by the persistence of p. gingivalis, especially clones with type ii fimbriae, in periodontal pockets.

TI  == analysis of neutrophil-derived antimicrobial peptides in gingival crevicular fluid suggests importance of cathelicidin ll-37 in the innate immune response against periodontogenic bacteria.
AB  == introduction: during periodontitis, an innate immune response to bacterial challenge is primarily mediated by neutrophils. we compared neutrophilic content  and the level of neutrophil-derived antimicrobial peptides in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) in two clinical forms of severe periodontitis. methods: gcf was collected from 14 patients with aggressive periodontitis, 17 patients with chronic periodontitis, and nine healthy subjects. samples were analyzed for periodontopathogen load using real-time polymerase chain reactions. the amounts of myeloperoxidase and alpha-defensins (hnp1-3) were determined by enzyme-linked  immunosorbent assay, and the level of cathelicidin (hcap18/ll-37) was assayed by  western blot. results: myeloperoxidase concentration was not correlated with levels of ll-37 and hnp1-3 in samples from patients, compared to controls. the amount of hnp1-3 was twofold and fourfold higher in patients with aggressive and  chronic periodontitis, respectively. those with chronic disease had significantly elevated amounts of mature ll-37. the increased concentration of both peptides in chronic periodontitis correlated with the load of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. conclusion: the lack of a correlation between ll-37, hnp1-3, and myeloperoxidase content suggests that neutrophils are not the sole source of these bactericidal peptides in the gcf of  patients with periodontitis; and that other cells contribute to their local production. the bacterial proteases of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola might degrade hcap18/ll-37, because the 11-kda cathelicidin-derived fragment was present in gcf collected from pockets infected with these bacteria.  collectively, it appears that a local deficiency in ll-37 can be considered as a  supporting factor in the pathogenesis of severe cases of periodontitis.

TI  == distribution of 10 periodontal bacterial species in children and adolescents over a 7-year period.
AB  == objective: there is scant information available regarding the distribution of periodontal bacterial species in children and adolescents over an extended period. the purpose of this study was to compare bacterial profiles in the same individuals over a period of 7 years. subject and methods: twenty-six children and adolescents from whom dental plaque and saliva specimens were obtained during both the first (1999-2000) and second (2006-2007) periods, were analyzed. bacterial dna was extracted from each specimen and the presence of 10 periodontal bacterial species was determined using a pcr method, with a focus on the red complex species of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella  forsythia. results: subjects with red complex species in saliva specimens obtained during the second collection possessed a significantly higher number of  total bacterial species than those without. the detection rate of the red complex species in the second collection period samples was significantly greater in subjects who had two or more species detected in samples taken during the first collection compared with the other subjects. conclusion: subjects possessing red  complex species may be at possible risk for infection with a high number of periodontal bacterial species during adolescent and younger adult years.

TI  == differential gender effects of a reduced-calorie diet on systemic inflammatory and immune parameters in nonhuman primates.
AB  == background and objective: dietary manipulation, including caloric restriction, has been shown to impact host response capabilities significantly, particularly in association with aging. this investigation compared systemic inflammatory and  immune-response molecules in rhesus monkeys (macaca mulatta). material and methods: monkeys on continuous long-term calorie-restricted diets and a matched group of animals on a control ad libitum diet, were examined for systemic response profiles including the effects of both gender and aging. results: the results demonstrated that haptoglobin and alpha1-antiglycoprotein levels were elevated in the serum of male monkeys. serum igg responses to campylobacter rectus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were significantly elevated in female monkeys. while only the antibody to fusobacterium nucleatum was significantly affected by the calorie-restricted diet in female monkeys, antibody levels to prevotella intermedia, c. rectus and treponema denticola demonstrated a similar trend. conclusion: in this investigation, only certain serum antibody levels were influenced by the age of male animals, which was seemingly related to increasing clinical disease in this  gender. more generally, analytes were modulated by gender and/or diet in this oral model system of mucosal microbial challenge.

AB  == loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) was applied to develop a rapid and  simple detection system for eight periodontal pathogens: aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia. primers were designed from the 16s ribosomal rna gene for each pathogen, and the lamp amplified the targets specifically and efficiently under isothermal condition at 64 degrees c.  to simplify the manipulation of lamp examination, boiled cells and intact cells suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) were tested as templates besides extracted dna template. the detection limits were 1-10 cells per tube using extracted dna template. however, lamp methods using boiled cells and intact cells required 10-100 and 100-1000 cells per tube, respectively. lamps for a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and p. intermedia were then applied to clinical plaque samples, and the method demonstrated equal or higher sensitivity  compared with the conventional real-time pcr method. these findings suggest the usefulness of the lamp method for the rapid and simple microbiological diagnosis  of periodontitis, and the possibility of lamp examination without the dna extraction step.

TI  == [relationship between herpesviruses and periodontal pathogenic bacteria in subgingival plaque].
AB  == objective: to evaluate the prevalence rates of human cytomegalovirus(hcmv) and epstein-barr virus-1(ebv-1) in subgingival plaque and analyze the relationship between herpesviruses, periodontal pathogenic bacteria and periodontal clinical parameters in chinese patients with aggressive periodontitis(agp). methods: a total of one hundred and twenty subgingival plaque samples were collected from 89 agp patients and 31 healthy subjects. hcmv and ebv-1 were detected using nested polymerase chain reaction(pcr).contemporaneously, 8 periodontal pathogenic bacteria including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans(aa), porphyromonas gingivalis(pg), tannerella forsythensis(tf), prevotella intermedia(pi), campylobacter rectus(cr),fusobacterium nucleatum(fn), treponema denticola(td), prevotella nigrescens(pn) were detected by 16s rrna based pcr. results: hcmv was  more frequently detected in agp patients (43.8%) than in healthy controls (12.9%, p<0.01). the prevalence rates of hcmv and ebv-1 in agp patients with 6-8 kinds of bacteria detected were 54.4% and 17.4%, respectively, significantly higher than those with 3-5 kinds of bacteria detected (p<0.05). conclusion: the prevalence rates of hcmv and ebv was higher in agp patients than in healthy controls. herpesviruses and periodontal pathogenic bacteria may cooperate synergistically in the development of agp, which could be considered as a pathogenetic consortium in future investigation of periodontaltitis.

TI  == pcr-based identification of selected pathogens associated with endodontic infections in deciduous and permanent teeth.
AB  == objective: the aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence of the selected pathogens in samples from deciduous and permanent tooth root canals by using pcr method and to determine the association of these organisms with clinical symptoms. study design: a total of 145 children, 5 to 13 years old, were involved in this study. the presence of selected pathogens (actinomyces israelii, candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, streptococcus intermedius, treponema denticola, parvimonas micra, tannerella forsythensis, enterococcus faecium, prevotella melaninogenica) in infected root canals was studied using pcr. results: t. denticola (p = .012, .02) and e. faecalis (p = .012, .04) were highly associated with periapical radiolucency and previous pain, while p. gingivalis was associated with tenderness to percussion in both deciduous and permanent teeth (p = .01, .015). conclusion: the results of the present study confirm that certain species of microorganisms are associated with  clinical signs and symptoms of endodontic disease in both deciduous and permanent teeth.

TI  == an interleukin-1beta (il-1beta) single-nucleotide polymorphism at position 3954 and red complex periodontopathogens independently and additively modulate the levels of il-1beta in diseased periodontal tissues.
AB  == inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1beta (il-1beta) are involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. a high individual variation in the levels of il-1beta mrna has been verified, which is possibly determined by genetic polymorphisms and/or by the presence of periodontopathogens such as porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. in this study, we investigated the role of an il-1beta promoter single-nucleotide polymorphism at position 3954 [il-1beta(3954) snp] and the presence of the periodontopathogens in the determination of the il-1beta levels in the periodontal tissues of nonsmoking chronic periodontitis (cp) patients (n = 117) and control (c) subjects (n = 175) and the possible correlations with the clinical parameters of the disease. il-1beta(3954) snp was  investigated by restriction fragment length polymorphism, while the il-1beta levels and the presence of the periodontopathogens were determined by real-time pcr. similar frequencies of il-1beta(3954) snp were found in the c and cp groups, in spite of a trend toward a higher incidence of t alleles in the cp group. the il-1beta(3954) snp ct and tt genotypes, as well as p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola, were associated with higher il-1beta levels and with higher values of the clinical parameters of disease severity. concomitant analyses demonstrate that il-1beta(3954) and the red complex periodontopathogens were found to independently and additively modulate the levels of il-1beta in periodontal tissues. similarly, the concurrent presence of both factors was associated with increased scores of disease severity. il-1beta(3954) genotypes and red complex periodontopathogens, individually and additively, modulate the levels of il-1beta in the diseased tissues of nonsmoking cp patients and, consequently, are potentially involved in the determination of the disease outcome.

TI  == an update on periodontal aetiopathogenesis and clinical implications.
AB  == periodontal disease is the most commonly occurring yet unusual infection in humans. it is initiated by pathogenic plaque biofilm and characterized by bacteria-induced inflammatory destruction of tooth-supporting structures and alveolar bone. periodontitis remains the most common cause of tooth loss in adults. currently, periodontal diseases are also recognized as serious infections with profound effects on general health. in recent years, new concepts and discoveries have been made in further understanding of the nature of periodontal  disease and its aetiopathogenesis. these can be well reflected in recognition of  dental plaque as a biofilm; identification and characterization of periodontopathogens and their virulence factors; recognition of the importance of host-microbe symbiosis in periodontal health; identification of novel innate host defence molecules in periodontal tissues; further understanding of the molecular  mechanisms involved in tissue destruction and alveolar bone resorption; appreciation of the crucial role of host susceptibility in periodontal pathogenesis; and identification of risk factors and incorporation of risk assessment in clinical practice. committed oral health care professionals should  therefore keep abreast of these changing concepts in periodontology and updated strategies for appropriate evidence-based practice. these views are fundamentally important for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of periodontal diseases and peri-implant infections, as well as for long-term maintenance of periodontal health and implant stability. this paper updates the advances in aetiopathogenesis of periodontal disease and highlights the relevant clinical implications and future perspectives.

TI  == photodynamic therapy as adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment in patients on periodontal maintenance: a randomized controlled clinical trial.
AB  == recent preclinical and clinical data have suggested the potential benefit of photodynamic therapy (pdt) in the treatment of periodontitis. however, currently, there are very limited data from controlled clinical trials evaluating the effect of pdt in the treatment of periodontitis. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects of the adjunctive use of pdt in non-surgical periodontal treatment in patients receiving supportive periodontal therapy. twenty-four patients receiving regularly supportive periodontal therapy  were randomly treated with either subgingival scaling and root planing followed by a single episode of pdt (test) or subgingival scaling and root planing alone (control). the following parameters were evaluated at baseline and at 3 months and 6 months after therapy: full mouth plaque score (fmps), full mouth bleeding score (fmbs), bleeding on probing (bop) at experimental sites, probing pocket depth (ppd), gingival recession (rec), and clinical attachment level (cal). primary outcome variables were changes in ppd and cal. microbiological evaluation of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.), prevotella intermedia (p.i.), tannerella forsythensis (t.f.), treponema denticola (t.d.), peptostreptococcus micros (p.m.), fusobacterium nucleatum (f.n.), campylobacter rectus (c.r.), eubacterium nodatum (e.n.), eikenella corrodens (e.c.), and capnocytophaga species (c.s.) was also performed at baseline and at 3 months and 6 months after therapy, using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test. no differences in any of the investigated parameters were observed at baseline between the two groups. at 3 months and 6 months after treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups in terms of ppd, cal and fmps. at 3 months and 6 months, a statistically significantly higher improvement of bop was found in the test group. at 3 months  after therapy, the microbiological analysis showed a statistically significant reduction of f.n. and e.n. in the test group. at 6 months, statistically significantly higher numbers of e.c. and c.s. were detected in the test group. the additional application of a single episode of pdt to scaling and root planing failed to result in an additional improvement in terms of ppd reduction and cal gain, but it resulted in significantly higher reduction of bleeding scores than following scaling and root planing alone.

TI  == comparative analysis of putative periodontopathic bacteria by multiplex polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == background and objective: the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) has been applied for the rapid and specific detection of periodontopathic bacteria in subgingival  plaque and is potentially of clinical benefit in the diagnosis and treatment of periodontitis subjects. however, several technical points need to be modified before the conventional pcr detection system can be used by clinicians. material  and methods: to develop a pcr-based technique more applicable for clinical use than conventional pcr, we established a multiplex pcr for five putative periodontopathic (treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter  actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia and tannerella forsythia) and two nonperiodontopathic (streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus salivarius) species of bacteria using whole-plaque suspension as templates, and detected bacteria in subgingival plaque taken from 85 subjects at the supportive periodontal therapy stage after active periodontal treatments. results: among putative periodontopathic bacteria, the detection frequency of t. denticola and p. gingivalis was elevated in parallel with higher probing pocket depth and clinical attachment loss, and had 4.2-14.1 times increasing odds of the clinical  parameters tested. detection of any of the five species of putative periodontopathic bacteria markedly increased the odds ratio of a higher probing pocket depth, clinical attachment loss and bleeding on probing. conclusion: the multiplex pcr system developed in this study enabled the detection of all the bacteria under investigation in one reaction tube in a less time- and labor-intensive manner than conventional pcr. these results support the potential clinical use of multiplex pcr for detecting periodontopathic bacteria and for evaluating therapeutic strategies and predicting the prognosis for each subject.

TI  == the prevalence of periodontopathogenic bacteria in saliva is linked to periodontal health status and oral malodour.
AB  == this study investigated whether an improvement in periodontal health resulted in  changes in the prevalence of periodontopathogenic bacteria in saliva and tongue coatings and a reduction in volatile sulfur compounds (vscs: h(2)s and ch(3)sh) linked to oral malodour. the subjects were 35 patients who visited the breath odour clinic of kyushu dental college, japan. their mean age was 51.2+/-18.3 years (mean+/-sd). a clinical examination performed at baseline and 2 months after periodontal treatment assessed vscs in mouth air using gas chromatography,  periodontal probing depth and bleeding on probing (bop) in all subjects; saliva and tongue coatings were also collected. genomic dna was isolated from the samples, and the proportions of five periodontopathogenic bacteria (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens) were investigated using quantitative real-time pcr. the subjects were classified into four groups based on the presence of a periodontal pocket of more than 4 mm (pd) and vscs above the organoleptic threshold level (vsct) as follows: -pd/-vsct group, subjects without pd or vsct;  -pd/+vsct group, those without pd but with vsct; +pd/-vsct group, those with pd but without vsct; and +pd/+vsct group, those with pd and vsct. although the mean  pd values in the +pd/-vsct and +pd/+vsct groups, bop in the +pd/+vsct group, and  h(2)s and ch(3)sh concentrations in the -pd/+vsct and +pd/+vsct groups were greater than in the other groups at baseline, we found no significant difference  among the four groups after periodontal treatment. the proportion of periodontopathogenic bacteria in saliva was higher in the +pd/-vsct and +pd/+vsct groups than in the -pd/-vsct and -pd/+vsct groups at baseline and after treatment, but the proportions of bacteria in saliva after treatment were reduced compared to the baseline. furthermore, the differences in the proportions of the  five target bacteria in the tongue coating were not as apparent as those in saliva at baseline or after treatment. the prevalence of periodontopathogenic bacteria in saliva may reflect periodontal health status and influence vsc levels in mouth air.

TI  == microbial analysis of canals of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions using polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == the objective of the present study was to investigate the presence of nine bacterial species in root-filled teeth associated with periapical lesions using a polymerase chain reaction analysis and to correlate these species with clinical features of the cases. dna was extracted from 45 canal samples of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions. a pcr assay using species-specific primers of 16s  rdna and the downstream intergenic spacer region was used for microbial detection. enterococcus faecalis was the most prevalent species, detected in 77.8% of the study teeth, followed by peptostreptococcus micros, detected in 51.1%. porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens were detected in 35.6%, 22.2%, 11.1%, and 11.1% of the sampled teeth, respectively. moreover, pcr detected filifactor alocis in 26.7%, treponema denticola in 24.4%, and tannerella forsythia in 4.4% of the samples. t. denticola and p. micros were statistically associated with tenderness to percussion (p < 0.05). p. nigrescens was associated with the presence of spontaneous pain and abscess (p < 0.05). p. endodontalis and p. nigrescens were associated with purulent exudates (p < 0.05). synergistic relationship was also observed between some species. the results of this study indicated that e. faecalis was the most frequently identified test species by pcr in teeth with failing endodontic treatment.

AB  == background: evidence is accumulating that oral bacteria are associated with myocardial infarctions (mi). we were interested in studying the differences in the association between single bacteria or bacteria in combination and the relation to c-reactive protein (crp). material and methods: we examined the levels of antibodies against four major periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), tannerella forsythia (tf) and treponema denticola (td) and crp in 548 men with a self-reported history of mi to 625 controls who took part in the oslo ii study in 2000. results: the mean levels of bacterial antibodies were higher for the cases than the controls,  but not significant as standard deviations were large. the level of crp was higher in the cases than the controls (p=0.010). logistic regression analyses comparing the upper quartile value with the lower value of one of either four antibodies (anti-aa, anti-tf, anti-td and anti-pg) were significantly associated  (p=0.032) with mi. equivalent analyses of either three bacteria showed significant associations for anti-aa, anti-td and anti-pg (p=0.036) and anti-aa,  anti-pg and anti-tf (p=0.040). crp showed an increased relative risk with increasing quartile value; trend, p=0.016, but not in multivariate analysis including the oral antigens. conclusions: no single bacterium but rather combinations were related to increasing relative risk for mi independent of known cardiovascular risk factors.

TI  == bleeding on probing differentially relates to bacterial profiles: the oral infections and vascular disease epidemiology study.
AB  == aim: various bacterial species are differentially prevalent in periodontal health, gingivitis or periodontitis. we tested the independent associations between three bacterial groupings and gingival inflammation in an epidemiological study. material and methods: in 706 oral infections and vascular disease epidemiology study (invest) participants > or =55 years, bleeding on probing (bop), pocket depth (pd) and subgingival plaque samples (n=4866) were assessed in eight sites per mouth. eleven bacterial species were quantitatively assayed and grouped as follows: (i) aetiologic burden (eb, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella  forsythia); (ii) putative burden (pb, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens,  fusobacterium nucleatum, micromonas micros, prevotella intermedia); (iii) health-associated burden (hab, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula). results: after mutual adjustment for eb, pb and hab, the bop prevalence increased by 45% ( p<0.0001) across increasing quartiles of eb while bop decreased by 13% ( p<0.0001) across increasing quartiles of hab. mean pd increased 0.8 mm and decreased 0.3 mm from the first to fourth quartiles of eb (p<0.0001) and hab ( p<0.0001), respectively. among 1214 plaque samples with fourth quartile eb, 60% were collected from sites with pd < or =3 mm. conclusion: bacterial species believed to be aetiologically related to periodontitis were associated with bop in sites with minimal pd and/or attachment level (al). species presumed to be associated with periodontal health demonstrated inverse associations with bop.

TI  == the reproducibility of curet sampling of subgingival biofilms.
AB  == background: because few studies have examined the critical issue of sampling reproducibility, the purpose of the present study was to examine the reproducibility of curet sampling of subgingival biofilms. methods: seven subgingival biofilm samples were taken successively, using a curet, from each of  80 sites and individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. one healthy site was sampled in each of 20 periodontally healthy subjects, and one sulcus/pocket of < or =3, 4 to 5, and  > or =6 mm was sampled in each of 20 subjects with chronic periodontitis. the significance of differences in counts and proportions of individual species at the seven successive samplings for each probing depth (pd) category was determined using the kruskal-wallis test. the reproducibility of species proportions at each pd category was measured using the coefficient of variation (cv), and the consistency of microbial profiles across samples was examined using the minimum similarity coefficient. results: there was no significant difference  in the mean proportions of the 40 test species in the seven successive samples in each of the four pd categories. the median cv for individual species in the same  site was 0.79 (95% confidence interval [ci]: 0.76 to 0.82) compared to 1.76 (95%  ci: 1.69 to 1.82) in samples from different sites. the within-site mean minimum similarity coefficient (+/- sem) was 51.2% +/- 2.2%, and it was 27.9% +/- 0.3% between sites. conclusion: the proportions of species remained consistent in successive curet samples, indicating that the use of curets provided a reliable and reproducible method to obtain subgingival samples.

TI  == site-specific development of periodontal disease is associated with increased levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia in subgingival plaque.
AB  == background: porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), which are regarded as the principal periodontopathogenic bacteria, exist as a consortium in subgingival biofilms. we  aimed to examine quantitative relationships between p. gingivalis, t. denticola,  and t. forsythia in subgingival biofilms and the relationship between the quantity and prevalence of these three bacteria and site-specific periodontal health. methods: this study was cross-sectional. the study population consisted of 35 adult subjects who visited the kyushu dental college hospital. plaque samples were collected from 105 periodontal pocket sites. quantitative analyses of each of the three periodontopathogenic bacteria were performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction with species-specific primers and hybridization probes. results: the plaque samples were divided into four groups based on the presence or absence of a periodontal pocket (probing depth [pd] > or =4 mm) and bleeding on probing (bop), regardless of attachment loss. the proportions of all three target bacteria detected in samples from sites of periodontal disease (with pd and bop) were markedly higher than those in the other sample groups. cell numbers of p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia in the subgingival plaque of each sampling site were significantly mutually correlated and were increased in the plaque of sites of periodontal disease with pd > or =4 mm and bop. conclusion: the symbiotic effects of p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia, which coaggregate and exist concomitantly in subgingival biofilms, may be associated with the local development of periodontitis.

AB  == background: the microbiology of periodontitis in type 1 diabetes has been reported, but less is known about type 2 diabetes. moreover, these data have not  linked microbial colonization, host response, and clinical presentation in type 1 or type 2 diabetes. the objectives of this study were to relate periodontal status, periodontal microorganisms, and host-response characteristics in hispanic americans with type 2 diabetes. methods: plaque and serum samples were obtained from 63 hispanic american subjects with and without type 2 diabetes. the microbiology of subgingival plaque samples was evaluated using dna checkerboard hybridization, and serum antibody to a battery of oral microorganisms was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: in general, similar pathogens were present in periodontitis sites from subjects with and without type 2 diabetes, although the periodontitis sites in diabetes showed a higher frequency of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and campylobacter spp. serum antibody to campylobacter rectus was elevated in type 2  diabetes, whereas antibody to p. gingivalis and c. rectus were elevated in subjects with periodontitis, irrespective of diabetes status. stratification of the population based upon antibody to p. gingivalis or c. rectus suggested a linkage between elevated antibody to p. gingivalis, increased frequency of diabetes, and significantly worse periodontitis. conclusion: the increased severity of periodontal disease with type 2 diabetes may reflect an alteration of the pathogenic potential of periodontal bacteria and/or a modification of the characteristics of the host's inflammatory response that may contribute to a breakdown in the homeostasis of the periodontium.

AB  == introduction: this study aimed to measure the levels of interleukin-18 (il-18) in inflamed shallow sites and inflamed deep sites in patients with periodontitis and to compare the data with results from inflamed shallow sites in patients with gingivitis. a secondary aim was to examine the composition of the subgingival microbiota in the sampled sites. methods: gingival crevicular fluid was collected from five gingivitis sites and five periodontitis sites from 18 patients with chronic periodontitis, and from five gingivitis sites from 15 patients with gingivitis. samples from each site category were pooled and il-18 levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the subgingival microbiota was analyzed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: all clinical parameters and gingival crevicular fluid volumes were higher in periodontitis sites compared with gingivitis sites from patients with periodontitis and gingivitis. the total amount of il-18 was higher in periodontitis sites than gingivitis sites in both periodontitis (p = 0.018) and gingivitis (p = 0.002) patients and was higher in gingivitis sites from periodontitis patients than in those from gingivitis patients (p = 0.015). there were higher levels of tannerella forsythia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola (red complex species) in periodontitis sites compared with gingivitis sites in both the periodontitis and gingivitis patients (p < 0.001). conclusion: levels of il-18 were higher in patients with chronic periodontitis compared with patients with gingivitis, even at sites with similar pocket depths. the presence of similar levels of red complex species in gingivitis sites from periodontitis patients and from gingivitis patients suggested that the higher levels of il-18 were not associated with a different microbial challenge.

TI  == high incidence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans infection in acute coronary syndrome.
AB  == recent epidemiological studies suggest that periodontitis is an important risk factor for coronary heart disease (chd). the aim of this study was to evaluate the association between periodontitis and chd, particularly acute coronary syndrome (acs), focusing on microbiological and immunological features. twenty-eight chd patients, 15 with acs and 13 with chronic chd, were included in  this study. coronary angiography, periodontal examination, and dental radiography were performed in all patients. subgingival plaque, saliva, and blood samples were analyzed for the periodontopathogens actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia using polymerase chain reaction. specific serum antibody titers to the 5 periodontal pathogens were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. it was found that 33% of the acs patients (5/15) harbored a. actinomycetemcomitans in oral samples, whereas no a. actinomycetemcomitans (0/13) was found in the chronic chd patients (p < 0.05). furthermore, acs patients showed significantly higher serum igg titers to a. actinomycetemcomitans (p < 0.05) compared with chronic chd. more tooth loss and alveolar bone loss were noted in acs patients than in chronic chd patients, although the differences were not statistically significant. periodontal pathogens, particularly a. actinomycetemcomitans, may play a role in the development of acs.

TI  == identification of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola and porphyromonas gingivalis within human dental calculus: a pilot investigation.
AB  == objective: dental calculus is considered to be simply a "plaque-retentive factor", and therefore only a secondary aetiological factor in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. recent studies have suggested a more active role for calculus.  our objective was to demonstrate the presence of periodontal pathogens in the non-mineralised areas of supra- and subgingival dental calculus. methods: subjects for the study were derived from patients with substantial amounts of supragingival calculus in the lower anterior region who had moderate periodontal  disease, having been referred to the periodontal department at the eastman dental hospital for periodontal care. calculus was removed in as large pieces as possible by the use of a sickle or a push scaler placed underneath the apical or  facial border of the calculus and fracturing it from the tooth surface in a single stroke. the orientation and absence of dental plaque was confirmed using light microscopy for each sample prior to inclusion in this study. samples were prepared for transmission electron microscopic (tem) observation after immunogold staining with polyclonal antibodies for the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a. a.), porphyromonas gingivalis (p. g.) and treponema denticola (t. d.). results: most of the samples contained at least one of the bacterial species examined, either in the lacunae or in the covering dental plaque. t. d. was the most frequently identified species and was found in nearly  all of the subgingival samples, whilsta. a. was rarely observed. conclusions: in  this limited study, supra- and subgingival dental calculus appears to be capable  of maintaining periodontal pathogens within the deep recesses of its structural lacunae and channels. therefore, calculus could possibly play a relevant role in  the aetiology and pathogenesis of periodontitis. the presence of t. d. in the majority of specimens requires further investigation as its pathogenic potential  may be underestimated in current published microbiological research, and further  work is required to determine its role in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. however, further work by way of a large-scale definitive study is necessary to confirm the results of this investigation.

AB  == objectives: the aim of this case control study was to evaluate whether periodontitis was associated with peripheral arterial disease (pad). subjects and methods: twenty-five patients diagnosed with aorto-iliac and/or femoro-popliteal  occlusive disease and thirty-two generally healthy control subjects were enrolled in this study. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used to identify porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, cytomegalovirus (cmv), chlamydia pneumoniae, and helicobacter pylori  in tissue specimens taken from the anastomotic site of distal bypasses. periodontal status was evaluated; serum igg titres against the four listed bacteria were measured. results: periodontopathic bacteria were detected in 13/25 (52%) atherosclerotic specimens. cmv or c. pneumoniae was detected in 1/25 (4%) specimens; h. pylori was not detected from any of these specimens. fontaine grade iii or iv patients showed higher detection frequency of p. gingivalis than fontaine grade ii patients (57.1% vs 22.2%, p=0.09). after adjusting for age, gender, diabetes and smoking, periodontitis increased 5-fold the risk of having pad (or 5.45). there were preliminary indications that periodontitis was associated with increased serum il-6 and tnf-alpha concentrations. conclusions: this study suggests that periodontitis may be associated with an increased risk of pad. this association could result from the increased concentration of serum inflammatory cytokines in those with periodontitis.

TI  == innate immune responses of gingival epithelial cells to nonperiodontopathic and periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == background and objective: we have previously reported different susceptibilities  of periodontopathic and nonperiodontopathic bacteria to antimicrobial peptides and phagocytosis by neutrophils. differences between the two groups of bacteria may exist also in their ability to induce immune responses from the host. therefore, we evaluated the effects of various oral bacteria on innate immune responses by gingival epithelial cells. material and methods: hok-16b cells were  cocultured with live or lysed nonperiodontopathic (n = 3) and periodontopathic (n = 5) bacterial species. the levels of human beta defensin-1, -2 and -3, and of the cathelicidin, ll-37, were examined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and the accumulated interleukin-8 and interleukin-1 alpha were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results:  nonperiodontopathic bacteria up-regulated some antimicrobial peptides without affecting the levels of cytokines. in the periodontopathic group, the orange-complex bacteria induced antimicrobial peptides and interleukin-8 efficiently, but the red-complex bacteria often demonstrated suppressive effects. in contrast to live bacteria, bacterial lysates had no suppressive effects. in addition, some bacterial lysates demonstrated a reduced ability to induce antimicrobial peptides compared with live bacteria. conclusion: the nonperiodontopathic, the orange-complex, and the red-complex bacteria had different effects on the innate immune responses from gingival epithelial cells,  which may affect the outcome of their host-microbial interaction in gingival sulcus.

TI  == improved accuracy in terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism phylogenetic analysis using a novel internal size standard definition.
AB  == background: terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis is commonly used to analyze microbial communities, including oral microflora. however, accurate identification of terminal restriction fragment (t-rf) origins  is prevented by unpredictable errors in sizing, thus necessitating the clone library analysis. to minimize sizing errors, we proposed optimizing the size definition of internal standards. methods: genescan-1000 rox was regenerated as an internal standard by redefining the fragment sizes in terms of molecular weight (mw) based on their mobility relative to 6-carboxyfluorescein (fam) -labeled restriction fragments derived from the 16s recombinant rna gene of porphyromonas gingivalis. using the new size definition, the average sizing error among eight oral bacteria from six phyla was estimated and compared with that of  the conventional method. microbial communities isolated from saliva were analyzed using the new mw size definition. bacterial species were assigned to peaks using  trfma, a web-based tool for t-rflp analysis, and compared with those identified in a clone library analysis. results: using the new size definition, the average  sizing error for 40 t-rfs was drastically reduced from 2.42 to 0.62 bases, and large sizing errors (more than two bases) were eliminated. more than 90% of the total bacterial clones detected by the clone library analysis were assigned by t-rflp. conclusion: the size definition of the newly constructed internal standards reduced fragment sizing errors and allowed for accurate assignment of bacteria to peaks by the t-rflp analysis. this provided a more effective means for studying microbial communities, including the oral microflora.

TI  == polymerase chain reaction of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia in primary endodontic infections.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between endodontic clinical signs and symptoms and the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia or their association by nested polymerase chain reaction assay. microbial samples were taken from 50 cases with  necrotic pulp tissues in primary infections. dna was extracted from the samples,  which were analyzed for the presence of three endodontic pathogens by using species-specific primers. p gingivalis, t denticola, and t forsythia were detected in 46%, 38%, and 22% of the symptomatic cases, respectively. the bacterial complex composed by t forsythia, p gingivalis, and t denticola was found in 14% of the cases with spontaneous pain, tenderness to percussion, swelling, and pain on palpation. the high prevalence of p gingivalis, t denticola, and t forsythia in the samples examined suggests that these bacteria are related to the etiology of symptomatic periradicular diseases.

TI  == effect of adjunctive systemic azithromycin with periodontal surgery in the treatment of chronic periodontitis in smokers: a pilot study.
AB  == background: along with conventional surgical therapy, systemic antibiotics may provide more effective treatment in smokers by targeting tissue-invasive bacteria. the aim of this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked clinical  trial was to evaluate the adjunctive effects of systemic azithromycin (azm) in combination with periodontal pocket reduction surgery in the treatment of chronic periodontitis in smokers. methods: thirty patients with a greater than one pack/day smoking habit and generalized moderate to severe chronic periodontitis were randomized to the test (surgery plus 3 days of azm, 500 mg) or control group (surgery plus 3 days of placebo). full-mouth probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), bleeding on probing (bop), gingival index (gi), plaque index, and wound healing indices (whi) were assessed at baseline and at 2 weeks and 1, 3, and 6 months following surgical intervention. plaque and gingival crevicular fluid were collected for trypsin-like enzyme activity (benzoyl-dl-arginine naphthylamine) and bone biomarker (crosslinked telopeptide of type i collagen [ictp]) analyses, respectively, at baseline, 2 weeks, and 1, 3, and 6 months. results: surgical treatment of moderate (pd = 4 to 6 mm) and deep (pd > 6 mm) pockets significantly improved clinical parameters of treated and untreated teeth (cal gain, pd reduction, and reduction of bop). the additional use of azm did not enhance this improvement nor did it promote reduction of ictp levels. compared to the control group, the test group had significantly better whi scores at 1 month, significantly less gi at 2 weeks, and sustained reductions of red-complex bacteria with trypsin-like enzyme activity at 3 months. for non-surgery teeth, only the test group showed significant gains in  overall cal compared to baseline. conclusions: the findings of this pilot study demonstrated that in heavy smokers, adjunctive systemic azm in combination with pocket reduction surgery did not significantly enhance pd reduction or cal gain.  however, the clinical value of adjunctive azm may be appreciated by more rapid wound healing, less short-term gingival inflammation, and sustained reductions of periopathogenic bacteria. more expanded studies are recommended to better determine the clinical effects of adjunctive azm in patients who smoke.

TI  == implant surface analysis and microbiologic evaluation of failed implants retrieved from smokers.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the microbiota and surface of failed titanium dental implants from 4 manufacturers. twelve mobile dental implants were retrieved from 10 smokers after 3 to 10 years of functional loading. before implant removal, microbial samples were taken and evaluated using polymerase chain reaction. after implant removal, analyses of the failed implant surfaces were performed using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectrometer x-ray. periodontal pathogens such as aggregactibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were detected in all implants in different proportions. surface analysis showed varying degrees of surface roughness between the samples  and the presence of proteinaceous material, appearing mainly as dark stains. foreign carbon, oxygen, sodium, calcium, aluminum, and silicon elements were also found. although no material-related causes of implant failure were detected, several periodontal pathogens were identified independently of the surface topography or manufacturer.

TI  == benefits of additional courses of systemic azithromycin in periodontal disease case report.
AB  == the strong association of subgingival anaerobic bacteria, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia, with destructive periodontal disease has been well documented in the literature. several double-blind studies have also shown the beneficial use of systemic antimicrobials that are active against these microorganisms in conjunction with conventional periodontal treatment, especially when periodontal abscesses and/or  suppuration upon probing are present. four cases with periodontal abscesses were  treated with scaling/root planing in conjunction with systemic azithromycin. partial improvement led to retreatment with two additional courses of azithromycin. bone formation was noted on periapical radiographs after the patients took additional courses of azithromycin. in view of the benefits of using additional courses of azithromycin in the treatment of destructive periodontal disease, we conclude that the single course of systemic antimicrobials currently used in periodontal therapy may be insufficient to reach necessary therapeutic levels in infected sites.

TI  == salivary detection of periodontopathic bacteria in periodontally healthy children.
AB  == background: salivary occurrence of periodontopathic bacteria is of interest especially in children as a risk indicator for the transmission, development and  control of periodontal disease. we assessed the prevalence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola as microbial complexes  in the saliva of children with mixed dentition and healthy gingiva. materials and methods: paraffin-stimulated saliva samples were collected from 41 children (22 boys and 19 girls), aged 6-13 years old. gingival health was determined during the initial screening exam. the test bacteria were identified using a 16s rrna-based pcr analysis. results: p. nigrescens was the most frequent species (80%), followed by t. denticola (32%), a. actinomycetemcomitans (24%) and p. gingivalis (12%). p. intermedia and t. forsythia were not detected. p. nigrescens was also common species in combinations. paired and triple bacterial combinations were found in 24% and 20% of all children, respectively. there was no positive association between bacterial combinations in colonization and subject's gender (p>0.05, fisher exact test). conclusion: the salivary presence of p. nigrescens,  t. denticola, a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis but not p. intermedia and t. forsythia can occur in childhood without clinical signs of gingival disease. thus, the possible risk of bacterial transmissions through saliva and, the need to screen for periodontal pathogens should be considered before mixed dentition.

TI  == mechanical therapy with adjunctive minocycline microspheres reduces red-complex bacteria in smokers.
AB  == background: smoking increases the risk for periodontal disease and reduces the healing response. we examined the antimicrobial and clinical effects of scaling and root planing (srp) with and without minocycline hcl 1 mg microspheres (mm) relative to smoking status in subjects with periodontitis. methods: a total of 127 subjects (46 never smokers, 44 former smokers, and 37 current smokers) with moderate to advanced periodontitis were randomized to receive mm + srp (n = 62) or srp alone (n = 65). subgingival plaque samples collected at baseline and day 30 were examined for the presence of 40 periodontal bacteria by dna probe analysis. results: mm + srp reduced red-complex bacteria (rcb) numbers and proportions to a greater extent than srp alone, irrespective of smoking status. rcb numbers were not reduced by srp in current smokers. the difference in the reduction in numbers of rcb by srp relative to mm + srp in current smokers was statistically significant (p <0.05). numbers and proportions of orange complex bacteria (ocb) were reduced in all groups treated with mm + srp. proportions of ocb increased in current smokers treated with srp alone. in current smokers, mm + srp significantly reduced probing depth (pd), increased clinical attachment level (cal), and reduced bleeding on probing (bop) to a greater extent than srp alone (p <0.05). conclusions: srp alone was ineffective at reducing numbers or proportions of rcb or ocb in current smokers, whereas mm + srp significantly reduced both. mm + srp also improved pd, bop, and cal to a greater extent than srp alone independent of smoking status.

TI  == microbiologic analysis of periodontal pockets and carotid atheromatous plaques in advanced chronic periodontitis patients.
AB  == background: in recent years, many researchers have focused their attention on the ability of periodontal pathogens to colonize atheromatous plaques. nevertheless,  a clear correlation between the detection rates of periodontopathic bacterial dna in atheromas and in subgingival plaque samples has not been established. the aim  of our study was to assess the presence of five periodontal pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia [formerly tannerella forsythensis]) in periodontal pockets and in carotid atheromas recovered from the same patients. methods: thirty-three patients with advanced chronic periodontitis scheduled for endarterectomy were enrolled in the study. dna was extracted from subgingival plaque samples and carotid atheromas. universal bacteria primers for  general detection of bacteria and species-specific primers for detection of periodontal pathogens were used to amplify part of the 16s rrna gene by polymerase chain reaction. results: all subgingival plaque samples were positive  for at least one target microorganism. the prevalence of t. forsythia, p. gingivalis, t. denticola, p. intermedia, and a. actinomycetemcomitans were 69.7%, 63.6%, 54.5%, 45.4%, and 33.3%, respectively. bacterial dna was detected in 31 out of 33 endarterectomy specimens. however, none of the samples tested positive  for dna from periodontal pathogens. conclusion: the presence of periodontal bacteria in atheromatous plaques was not confirmed by this investigation; thus, no correlation could be drawn between periodontitis bacteria and microorganisms involved in the atherosclerotic lesions.

AB  == background: the objective of this trial was to measure the antimicrobial effects  of a minocycline hcl microsphere (mm) local drug-delivery system when used as an  adjunct to scaling and root planing (srp). dna probe analysis for 40 bacteria was used to evaluate the oral bacteria of 127 subjects with moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis. methods: subjects were randomly assigned to either srp alone (n = 65) or mm + srp (n = 62). the primary endpoints of this study were changes in numbers and proportions of the red-complex bacteria (rcb) and the sum  of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (formally t. forsythensis), and treponema denticola relative to 40 oral bacteria at each test site from baseline  to day 30. numbers of rcb from the five test sites were averaged to provide a value for each subject. results: mm + srp reduced the proportion of rcb by 6.49%  and the numbers by 9.4 x 10(5). the reduction in rcb proportions and numbers by srp alone (5.03% and 5.1 x 10(5), respectively) was significantly less. in addition, mm + srp reduced probing depth by 1.38 mm (compared to 1.01 mm by srp alone), bleeding on probing was reduced by 25.2% (compared to 13.8% by srp alone), and a clinical attachment level gain of 1.16 mm (compared to 0.80 mm by srp alone) was achieved. conclusion: these observations support the hypothesis that rcbs are responsible for periodontal disease and that local antimicrobial therapy using mm + srp effectively reduces numbers of rcbs and their proportions  to a greater extent than srp alone.

AB  == our 10-year study of early-onset periodontitis (eop) patients includes repeated clinical observations, microbiological characteristics and analysis of genetic polymorphism of il-1a and il-1b genes. twenty patients (age 15-26 years) were divided according to the clinical status in the 4th year into a group with mean number of teeth with bleeding on probing (bp) 9.8 and mean number of teeth with periodontal pocket (pp) 2.23, and a group with mean number of teeth with bp 5.37  and no pp. significantly higher values of mean bp and pp were found among the groups during the study but a strong progression of disease was found only in 3 patients. the risk il-1a allele-2 and il-1b allele-2 genotype and bacterial presence were analyzed by dna hybridization methods. no significant differences of bacteria composition (treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) were found between the groups. a higher prevalence of composite il-1 genotype was detected in the group of eop patients with progressive disease. early finding of the disease followed by conservative therapy could positively influence the disease progression. eop treated in early  stages may, but need not, develop into the aggressive form in the presence of risk genotype il-1.

TI  == population-based study of salivary carriage of periodontal pathogens in adults.
AB  == large, general population-based data on carriage rates of periodontal pathogens hardly exist in the current literature. the objectives of the present study were  to examine the salivary detection of aggregatibacter (formerly actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis, and treponema denticola in a representative  sample of the adult population living in southern finland and to clarify which determinants are associated with the presence of these pathogens in saliva. 16s rrna-based pcr methods with species-specific primers were employed to determine the presence of the six target bacteria in stimulated saliva samples, which were  available from 1,294 subjects aged > or =30 years. the age group, gender, level of education, marital status, smoking history, number of teeth, and number of teeth with deepened pockets were included in the statistical analysis. in general, the carriage of periodontal pathogens was common, since at least one of  the examined pathogens was found in 88.2% of the subjects. in descending order, the total detection rates were 56.9%, 38.2%, 35.4%, 31.3%, 20.0%, and 13.9% for t. forsythensis, t. denticola, p. gingivalis, c. rectus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. intermedia, respectively. age per se was strongly associated with the carriage of p. gingivalis (p = 0.000), and the level of education with that of t. denticola (p = 0.000). there was an association between the number of teeth with deepened pockets and carriage of p. gingivalis (p = 0.000), p. intermedia (p = 0.000), t. denticola (p = 0.000), and a. actinomycetemcomitans (p = 0.004). the data suggest that distinct species have a  different carriage profile, depending on variables such as age, educational level, and periodontal status.

AB  == aim: to evaluate and compare the microbiological effects of hand instruments, er:yag-laser, sonic, and ultrasonic scalers in patients with chronic periodontitis. patient perception of each treatment was documented. material and  methods: from 72 patients, bacterial samples were collected from the deepest pocket in each quadrant (total: 288 sites). a polymerase chain reaction kit estimated the amount of aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), tannerella forsythensis (tf), and treponema denticola (td) at baseline as well as 3 and 6 months after therapy. one quadrant in each patient was randomly assigned to curettes (h-group), er:yag laser (l-group), sonic device (s-group), or ultrasonic device (u-group). results: three months post-operatively, the amounts of pg, pi,  tf, and td were significantly reduced in all groups. laser and sonic instrumentation failed to reduce aa. six months after therapy, significant differences were still detected for pg (l- and u-group), for pi and tf (s-group), and for td (l-, s- and u-group). patients rated ultrasonic treatment as more preferable than hand and laser instrumentation. conclusion: the various treatment methods resulted in a comparable reduction of the evaluated periodontal pathogens, and bacterial increase was only partially different 6 months post-operatively. ultrasonic instrumentation caused less discomfort.

TI  == herpesviral-bacterial synergy in the pathogenesis of human periodontitis.
AB  == purpose of review: periodontitis is an infectious disease, but the specific mechanisms by which tooth-supportive tissues are lost remain obscure. this article proposes an infectious disease model for periodontitis in which herpesviral-bacterial interactions assume a major etiopathogenic role. recent findings: epstein-barr virus type 1, cytomegalovirus and other herpesviruses occur at a high frequency in aggressive periodontitis lesions. also, herpesvirus-infected periodontitis lesions tend to harbor elevated levels of classic periodontopathic bacteria, including porphyromonas gingivalis, dialister  pneumosintes, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, treponema denticola and actinobacillus (aggregatibacter) actinomycetemcomitans. summary: conceivably, a herpesvirus active infection in the periodontium impairs  local defenses, thereby permitting overgrowth and increased aggressiveness of periodontopathic bacteria. in turn, periodontal pathogenic bacteria may augment the virulence of periodontal herpesviruses. it is suggested that interactions among herpesviruses and specific bacterial species constitute an important pathogenetic feature of periodontitis and maybe also of various non-oral infections.

AB  == background: the outcome of microbiological diagnostics may depend on the sampling technique. it was the aim of the present study to compare two widely used sampling techniques for subgingival bacteria using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. methods: twenty patients with chronic periodontitis were randomized into two groups. in group a, samples were taken first with a paper point and then with a curet at the same site (single-rooted teeth with probing depth >5 mm) before scaling and root planing and after 10 weeks. the sampling sequence was reversed in group b. the analysis enabled the quantification of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum,  porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythensis and total bacterial counts (tbcs). statistical analysis included t test, kappa, and spearman correlation. results: higher tbc was harvested with curets than by paper points (p = 0.008). the plaque composition with regard to total target pathogens was similar for both sampling techniques. a strong positive correlation was found between curet and paper point samples for tbc and single target bacteria. conclusions: overall, there was a relatively good agreement for the results of paper point and curet sampling. thus, both techniques seem to be suitable for microbiological diagnostics.

AB  == background: the aim of this in vivo prospective study was to detect the presence  of periopathogenic bacteria in persistent periapical lesions and to compare the reliability of two different methods: anaerobic culture and the dna hybridization technique. methods: samples were obtained from 24 patients with persistent periapical lesions referred for surgical endodontic treatment. a sterile paper point was inserted into the periapical lesion for 10 seconds. the point was stored in sterile transfer tubes and analyzed by dna hybridization. tissue samples were transported in transfer medium and analyzed further using anaerobic  culture. results: at least one periodontal pathogenic bacterium was found in seven of 24 cases. bacterial species present were treponema denticola (three cases), porphyromonas gingivalis (three cases), tannerella forsythensis (four cases), prevotella intermedia (one case), and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (three cases). no particular signs or symptoms were associated with the presence of these bacterial species. anaerobic culture failed to identify any of the periopathogenic bacteria. conclusions: periodontal pathogenic bacterial dna can be detected in persistent periapical lesions. anaerobic cultures failed to detect the periodontal pathogenic bacteria in positive hybridization assays, suggesting that standard culture methods lack sensitivity or that hybridization assays are flawed with low specificity. the clinical significance of the presence of bacterial dna in persistent periapical lesions remains to be determined.

TI  == periodontitis as a risk factor of coronary heart diseases?
AB  == background: unstable atherosclerotic plaque is a dangerous clinical state, possibly leading to acute coronary deficiency resulting in cardiac infarction. inflammatory factor's role in creating pathological lesions in the endothelium of coronary vessels is frequently raised. this state may be caused by bacteria able  to initiate clot formation in blood vessel and destabilizing atherosclerotic plaque already present. source of these pathogens are chronic inflammatory processes occurring in organism, among them periodontal disease as one of more frequent. aim of the work was to evaluate incidence of selected anaerobic bacteria in subgingival plaque and in atherosclerotic plaque in patients treated  surgically because of coronary vessels' obliteration. methods: study was performed on 20 individuals with chronic periodontitis. subgingival plaque was collected from periodontal pockets deeper than 5 mm dna test was used for marking eight pathogens responsible for periodontal tissues destruction. in the same patients, as well as in 10 edentulous individuals material from atherosclerotic plaque was collected during by-pass implantation procedure, and identical dna testing occurred. results: in 13 of 20 patients pathogens most frequent in severe chronic periodontitis were found in coronary vessels. in 10 cases those bacteria  were also present in atherosclerotic plaque. pathogens linked with periodontal disease were also found in 7 of 10 edentulous individuals. most frequently marked bacteria were: porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. conclusions: it  seems that advancement of periodontal disease does not have influence on bacteria permeability to coronary vessels. important is the presence of active inflammatory process expressed by significantly higher bleeding index in patients with marked bacteria in atherosclerotic plaque.

AB  == aim: in the last years the relationship between periodontitis and cardiovascular  diseases has been a subject of increasing research. the identification of periodontopathic bacteria in atheromas can contribute to our knowledge of such an association. the aim of our study was to assess the concomitant presence of 5 periodontal pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia) in periodontal pockets and in carotid atheromas recovered from the same individuals. methods: twenty-one patients with chronic periodontitis scheduled for endarterectomy for carotid stenosis were enrolled in the study. subgingival plaque samples and carotid atheromas were examined using the polymerase chain reaction and reverse hybridization techniques by means of specific probes for periodontal bacteria. human beta-globin amplification was used as internal polymerase chain reaction efficiency control. results: three patients were excluded because the endarterectomy specimens were negative to dna  amplification. all subgingival plaque samples were positive for at least one target micro-organism. the prevalence of tannerella forsythia, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was 72.22%, 61.11%, 55.56%, 50%, and 33.33%, respectively.  no periodontal bacteria dna was detected in any endarterectomy specimen. conclusions: the presence of periodontal bacteria in atheromatous plaques was not confirmed by this investigation and, thus, no correlation between periodontitis bacteria and micro-organisms involved in the atherosclerotic lesions could be drawn.

AB  == background and objective: interactions between oral bacteria and gingival epithelial cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. this study used in situ hybridization with 16 rrna probes and confocal  microscopy to detect the periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola within epithelial cells from periodontal pockets, gingival crevice, and buccal mucosa collected from subjects with chronic periodontitis (n = 14) and good periodontal health (n = 8). material and methods: each green fluorescent species-specific and universal probe was hybridized with all 58 epithelial samples from the 22 patients. the samples were observed by confocal microscopy to confirm the intracellular localization of oral species of bacteria. the mean frequency of detection and number of intracellular bacteria per epithelial cell were computed for each sample. results: the frequency of cells with internalized  bacteria was higher in samples from the gingival crevice than in samples from the oral mucosa. epithelial cells from all subjects harbored intracellular bacteria;  however, patients with periodontitis presented significantly higher counts of bacteria per cell than periodontally healthy individuals (p < 0.05). periodontal  pathogens showed a trend to be detected in higher numbers in epithelial cells from periodontitis patients. in particular, t. forsythia and t. denticola were significantly more prevalent in periodontal pocket cells than healthy sulci and buccal cell samples in the periodontitis group (p < 0.05). conclusion: those findings indicate that crevicular and buccal cells present internalized bacteria, regardless of periodontal status. however, higher bacterial loads are detected in cells from subjects with periodontitis.

TI  == aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans as indicator for aggressive periodontitis by two analysing strategies.
AB  == objective: to compare the subgingival microbiota of aggressive and chronic periodontitis (chp) using single-site and pooled plaque samples. methods: in 60 patients with aggressive or chp, subgingival plaque was sampled from the four deepest pockets using two sterile paper points simultaneously. one paper point from each pocket was put in a separate transport vial, the second was pooled with the three other paper points of a respective patient. the content of each vial was analysed for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis,  porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola. results: pooled plaque samples detected higher numbers for all tested pathogens than single-site samples. detection frequencies were similar for both strategies. using single-site samples, a. actinomycetemcomitans detection rate was statistically significantly  a higher in aggressive than in chp (p=0.01). a. actinomycetemcomitans was found in higher numbers, the other pathogens in lower numbers in aggressive than in chp. neither presence nor absence of one of the tested bacteria had sufficient positive or negative predictive value for aggressive periodontitis. conclusion: a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in higher numbers and frequency in aggressive than in chp. its detection may confirm the clinical diagnosis and influence therapy. as a diagnostic test, its sensitivity and predictive value was low.

TI  == prevalence of four putative periodontopathic bacteria in saliva of a group of brazilian children with mixed dentition: 1-year longitudinal study.
AB  == aim: this study aimed at evaluating the prevalence of putative periodontal pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, treponema denticola) in saliva of children with mixed dentition at two different time points, correlating these findings with a clinical parameter of gingival health. design: polymerase chain reaction (pcr) detection was used to determine the prevalence of these bacteria in saliva of 64  children in 2003 and 60 children in 2004. gingival health was assessed by gingival index. result: sixty-two (96.9%) and 50 (83.3%) children presented low gingival inflammation, whereas 2 (3.1%) and 10 (16.7%) had moderate scores in 2003 and 2004, respectively. majority of the children (81.3% in 2003 and 73.3% in 2004) had detectable levels of at least one of the bacteria. the prevalence found was of 4.7% and 1.7% for a. actinomycetemcomitans, 6.3% and 8.3% for p. gingivalis, 23.4% and 48.3% for p. nigrescens (p < 0.05), and 71.9% and 50% for t. denticola (p < 0.05) in 2003 and 2004, respectively. no significant relationship between gingival index and presence of these bacteria and combination of different species was found. conclusion: a high percentage of children harboured at least one of the putative periodontal pathogens in saliva,  but presented periodontally healthy conditions.

TI  == evidence of periopathogenic microorganisms in placentas of women with preeclampsia.
AB  == background: periodontal disease is a chronic inflammatory infectious disease that may act as a focus of infection. preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific hypertensive disorder that often leads to maternal morbidity and mortality. acute atherosis, the placental lesion of preeclampsia, shares many histopathological features with atherosclerosis. recently, chronic infection was linked to the initiation of atherosclerosis. oral pathogens have been detected in atherosclerotic plaques, where they may play a role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. the purpose of the present study was to explore the possibility that periopathogenic bacteria may translocate into the placental  tissues of women with preeclampsia. methods: samples were taken from 16 placentas obtained from cesarean sections of women with preeclampsia and from 14 age-matched healthy pregnant women. polymerase chain reaction was used to detect  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp., porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis, and treponema denticola. results: eight of the 16 (50%) placenta specimens were positive for one or more periopathogenic bacteria in the preeclampsia group, compared to only  two of the 14 samples (14.3%) from controls. bacterial counts were statistically  significantly higher in the preeclampsia group for all of the periopathogenic bacteria examined (p <or=0.0055). although all of the target periopathogenic bacteria were found in the preeclampsia group, only three (p. gingivalis, t. forsythensis, and t. denticola) were found in the control group. conclusion: the  significant presence of periopathogenic microorganisms or their products in human placentas of women with preeclampsia may suggest a possible contribution of periopathogenic bacteria to the pathogenesis of this syndrome.

TI  == the detection of eight putative periodontal pathogens in adult and rapidly progressive periodontitis patients: an institutional study.
AB  == purpose: periodontal disease is a commonly prevalent problem faced alike by both  the developed and third world countries but showing wide variations in prevalence and severity across different geographical areas. the purpose was to identify actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), ekinella corrodens (ec), campylobacter rectus (cr), bacteroides forsythus (bf), treponema denticola (td) and fusobacterium nucleatum  (fn) in indian adult periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis patients. materials and methods: paper points were used to collect the sample from 28 sites in both adult periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis (8 healthy/20 diseased sites) patients and dna analysis done. the categorical data was analysed by fishers exact test and difference in the clinical parameters was tested by mann-whitney test. results: in healthy sites of adult and rapidly progressive periodontitis patients, aa, ec, bf and aa, pg, pi, td, fn were detected respectively. however, when diseased and healthy sites were compared in  both adult periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis patients respectively, only pg( p =0.004), cr( p =0.04), fn( p =0.014) and pg( p =0.002),  cr( p =0.02), fn( p =0.008) were statistically significant. conclusion: the prevalence of the microorganisms correlate with the clinical parameters like probing depth and bleeding on probing as seen in the japanese and western periodontitis patients' population.

TI  == subgingival chlorhexidine varnish administration as an adjunct to same-day full-mouth root planing. ii. microbiological observations.
AB  == background: recently, the clinical additive value of a highly concentrated chlorhexidine (chx) varnish, when applied subgingivally as an adjunct to scaling  and root planing, was described. the objective of the present study was to investigate the microbiological impact of a treatment strategy for chronic periodontitis based on a combination of same-day full-mouth root planing and subgingival chx varnish administration. methods: a randomized, controlled, single-blind, parallel trial was conducted on 33 non-smoking chronic periodontitis patients. the control group received oral hygiene instructions and  same-day full-mouth root planing. the test group received the same instructions and treatment; however, all pockets also were disinfected using a supersaturated  chx varnish. subgingival plaque samples were collected from the deepest site per  quadrant in each patient at baseline and after 1, 3, and 6 months. pooled sample  analysis was performed using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based method for the identification of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythensis (tf), treponema denticola  (td), and prevotella intermedia (pi). results: in terms of detection frequency and bacterial levels, significant, mainly temporary, reductions from baseline were found in both groups. when a comparison was made between the control and the test group, significant differences in the detection frequency of tf (p = 0.024)  and td (p = 0.024), which favored the test group, were found at 1 month. a similar phenomenon was seen for td (p = 0.031) based on bacterial levels. an important trend toward lower tf levels in the test group also was found at 1 month (p = 0.052). compared to baseline levels, microbiological benefits in the test group seemed to be maintained, at least in part, over a 6-month period. in contrast, all microbial levels had relapsed in the control group at study termination. conclusion: the microbiological results of the present study promote the subgingival administration of a highly concentrated chx varnish as an adjunct to same-day full-mouth root planing.

TI  == a comparison of implant-supported, bar- or ball-retained mandibular overdentures: a retrospective clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic study of 10 edentulous patients attending a recall visit.
AB  == purpose: clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic comparisons of the peri-implant health in edentulous volunteers wearing long-standing implant-supported ball- or  dolder bar-retained mandibular overdentures were performed. materials and methods: ten age- and gender-matched individuals (mean age, 71 years) with either ball- or bar-retained complete mandibular overdentures, scheduled for an annual implant recall examination, were investigated an average of 7 years after implant placement. plaque and gingival crevicular fluid samples were obtained from the peri-implant sulcus. the groups were compared with regard to peri-implant probing depth; plaque and bleeding on probing scores; sulcular fluid flow rates; implant  stability measurements (periotest device); relative concentrations of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, and treponema denticola assessed by polymerase chain reaction analysis; and sulcular concentrations of interleukin-1beta and prostaglandin e2, assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: no statistically significant differences were found for any of the examined parameters between both study groups. conclusion: within the limitations of this study, both ball attachments and dolder bars can be recommended for overdenture retention, with either one showing satisfying clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic findings in the peri-implant tissues after several years of service in healthy recall patients with good oral hygiene habits.

TI  == subgingival plaque microbiota in hiv positive patients.
AB  == aim: to describe and compare the predominant bacterial and fungal species associated with gingivitis, periodontitis, and linear gingival erythema (lge), in hiv positive subjects with different immune status. methods: viral loads and cd4  levels determined hiv disease status. from pooled subgingival plaque, 16s and 18s rdna were cloned and sequenced to determine species identity. results: one hundred and nine bacterial species were identified from 14 subjects. nearly half  of the species were not cultivable. notably, the classical putative periodontal pathogens, treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia were below the limit of detection and were not detected. species of gemella, dialister, streptococcus and veillonella were predominant. in one hiv positive subject with periodontitis and low viral load, gemella morbillorum, a known opportunistic pathogen, constituted 84% of the clones. saccharomyces cerevisiae was the only fungal species detected in an lge subject and in periodontitis subjects with high viral loads. in periodontitis patients with low viral loads, candida albicans was predominant, while s. cerevisiae was only a minor component. conclusion: these case studies suggest that other bacterial species, rather than  the classical periodontal pathogens, may be involved in periodontal diseases of subjects with hiv. these data are indicative of opportunistic infections in a highly susceptible immunocompromised host.

AB  == objectives: to study the short-term microbiological changes following full-mouth  compared with quadrant wise scaling and root planing (fmrp and qrp) as well as long-term effects. method: twenty patients with chronic periodontitis were randomized into a test group treated in two sessions with subgingival scaling and root planing within 24 h (fmrp) and a control group treated quadrant by quadrant  in four sessions at intervals of one week (qrp). microbiological samples were taken in the two deepest pockets of the maxillary right quadrant immediately before treatment and after 1 day, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks. the samples were  evaluated by real-time pcr for quantification of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp., porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia as well as for total bacterial counts (tbc). results: treatment resulted in a tbc median log reduction of 0.75 (fmrp) and 0.72 (qrp). there were no differences between groups either for the short term (1 day-4 weeks) (analysis of variance: p=0.3150) or for long term (4-24 weeks) (analysis of variance: p=0.9671). likewise, no differences were detected for selected target bacteria. conclusion: the results of the present study showed similar microbiological outcomes following both treatment modalities.

TI  == evaluation of the incidence of periodontitis-associated bacteria in the atherosclerotic plaque of coronary blood vessels.
AB  == background: unstable atherosclerotic plaque is a dangerous clinical condition, possibly leading to acute coronary deficiency resulting in cardiac infarction. questions about the role of inflammatory factors in the formation of pathological lesions in the endothelium of coronary vessels have often been raised. this condition may be caused by bacteria that are able to initiate clot formation in a blood vessel, destabilizing an atherosclerotic plaque that is already present. the sources of these pathogens are chronic inflammatory processes occurring in the host, including periodontal disease, which is one of the most frequent conditions. the aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of selected anaerobic bacteria in subgingival and atherosclerotic plaque in patients treated  surgically because of coronary vessel obliteration. methods: the study was performed on 20 individuals with chronic periodontitis. subgingival plaque was collected from periodontal pockets >5 mm. dna testing was used to identify eight  pathogens responsible for periodontal tissue destruction. material from atherosclerotic plaques was collected from the same patients during bypass surgery, and dna testing by the same method was performed. results: in 13 of 20 patients, the pathogens most frequently found in severe chronic periodontitis were also found in coronary vessels. in 10 cases, those species of bacteria were  also present in atherosclerotic plaque. the most frequently identified bacteria were porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. conclusions: in patients with the severe form of chronic periodontitis, it seems that clinical attachment  loss is not associated with bacterial permeability into coronary vessels. what is important is the presence of an active inflammatory process expressed by a significantly higher bleeding index in those patients in whom the examined bacterial species were found in atherosclerotic plaque.

TI  == identification of the microorganisms responsible for periodontopathy by multiplex rt-pcr.
AB  == the aim of our research was to identify by bacterial genomic dna analysis the prevalence of five different species of periodontopathogenic bacteria present in  the subgingival biofilm, specifically: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), bacterioides forsytus  (bf), treponema denticola (td). for the analysis we used the systematic multiplex-pcr-microdent kit with species-specific primers. we studied a group of  48 subjects, 18 males and 30 females, from 18 to 78 years of age. the initial clinical screening enabled us to select, among the group analysed, 24 subjects with signs of active periodontopathy (group a) and 24 patients without identifiable clinical evidence of the disease used as the control group (group b). within the two experimental groups (a and b), the test was found to be positive in 75% of subjects from group a, whereas the test was found to be negative in all the subjects from group b. our research shows that the multiplex-pcr system is reliable. furthermore, the sensitivity and simplicity of  this technique, as well as the decrease in working times and the possibility of identifying non-culturable bacteria, since the presence of viable organisms is not essential, make this technique indicated for the simultaneous identification  of periodontopathogenic bacteria and might, in perspective, provide a more effective clinical alternative to the techniques of bacterial typing of the subgingival plaque.

TI  == rat model of polymicrobial infection, immunity, and alveolar bone resorption in periodontal disease.
AB  == one of the predominant polymicrobial infections of humans is expressed clinically as periodontal disease. porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia have been strongly implicated as members of a pathogenic consortium in the etiology of adult periodontitis. in this study we hypothesized  that p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia are synergistic in terms of virulence potential and induce chronic periodontal inflammation that leads to alveolar bone resorption in a polymicrobial infection in rats. groups of rats were infected with either p. gingivalis, t. denticola, or t. forsythia in monomicrobial infections or with all three species in polymicrobial oral infections with or without fusobacterium nucleatum. pcr analyses of oral microbial samples demonstrated that rats infected with one bacterium were orally  colonized by each of the bacteria during the study interval, and increased serum  immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody levels substantiated the interaction of the host  with the infecting bacteria. pcr analyses of the rats with polymicrobial infections demonstrated that most rats were infected with p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia as a consortium. furthermore, all rats exhibited a significant increase in the level of igg antibody to the polymicrobial consortium. radiographic measurement of alveolar bone resorption showed that rats infected with the polymicrobial consortium with or without f. nucleatum exhibited significantly increased alveolar bone resorption compared to the resorption in uninfected control rats, as well as the resorption in rats infected with one of the microbes. these results documented that p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia not only exist as a consortium that is associated with chronic periodontitis but also exhibit synergistic virulence resulting in the immunoinflammatory bone resorption characteristic of periodontitis.

AB  == background: periodontal pathogens were frequently detected in the occluded arteries of buerger disease patients, hence we hypothesized that the infection from periodontal pathogens may be associated with buerger disease. methods: we investigated periodontal status using various clinical parameters and serum igg antibody levels against t. denticola, p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. intermedia in nineteen buerger disease patients and fifteen control subjects.  the results were statistically analyzed. results: the prevalence of periodontitis and the percentages of probing sites with pd> or =4 mm and cal> or =4 mm were significantly higher in the patient group (p<0.001, p=0.016, and p<0.001, respectively). patients had significantly higher serum igg titers against t. denticola, p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans (p=0.002, p=0.039, and p=0.011, respectively). conclusions: this study provides evidence for possible implications of periodontitis in buerger disease.

TI  == two subgingival plaque-sampling strategies used with rna probes.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to compare the results of microbiological rna-probe analysis after subgingival plaque sampling applying two different strategies. methods: in 220 patients, clinical examinations were obtained prior to commencement of therapy for aggressive or generalized severe chronic periodontitis (n = 113), after combined mechanical and antibiotic anti-infective periodontal therapy (n = 43), or because of periodontal pockets despite adequate therapy (n = 64). subgingival plaque samples were obtained from  the three pockets with the deepest probing depths. two sterile paper points were  inserted simultaneously into the periodontal pockets. one paper point from each pocket was put into a separate transport vial; the second paper point was pooled  (multiple site test [mt3]) with paper points from each of the two other sampling  sites from the respective patient into a transport vial. the content of each vial was analyzed separately for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola (td) with a commercially available rna-probe test. results: for all tested pathogens, log-transformed numbers of bacteria were higher in pooled samples compared to the mean values for the separate samples (p < or =0.01). however, for td only, statistically significant differences in frequency were seen between the separate samples and mt3. these findings were observed over all samples as well as after evaluation of subgroups separately. conclusions: pooling of plaque samples increased the bacterial counts per analysis compared to separate samples and thus may increase the probability of detecting existing pathogens. however, this observation only was statistically significant for the frequency of td.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal species in symptomatic and asymptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  == phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal 16s rrna was used to examine polymicrobial communities within infected root canals of 20 symptomatic and 14 asymptomatic patients. nucleotide sequences from approximately 750 clones amplified from each patient group with universal bacterial primers were matched to the ribosomal database project ii database. phylotypes from 37 genera representing actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, firmicutes, fusobacteria and proteobacteria were identified. results were compared to those obtained with species-specific primers designed to detect prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas  gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus sp., streptococcus sp., fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythensis and treponema denticola. since members of the domain archaea have been implicated in  the severity of periodontal disease, and a recent report confirms that archaea are present in endodontic infections, 16s archaeal primers were also used to detect which patients carried these prokaryotes, to determine if their presence correlated with severity of the clinical symptoms. a methanobrevibacter oralis-like species was detected in one asymptomatic and one symptomatic patient. dna from root canals of these two patients was further analysed using species-specific primers to determine bacterial cohabitants. trep. denticola was  detected in the asymptomatic but not the symptomatic patient. conversely, porph.  endodontalis was found in the symptomatic but not the asymptomatic patient. all other species except enterococci were detected with the species-specific primers  in both patients. these results confirm the presence of archaea in root canals and provide additional insights into the polymicrobial communities in endodontic  infections associated with clinical symptoms.

TI  == antibodies to periodontal organisms are associated with decreased kidney function. the dental atherosclerosis risk in communities study.
AB  == background/aims: increasing evidence suggests that clinical signs of periodontal  disease are independently associated with renal impairment. however, no studies have examined the possible linkage of kidney disease with serum antibody to oral  pathogens. methods: the periodontal disease status was assessed in an older community-dwelling population (dental atherosclerosis risk in communities) to include: clinical measurements; oral biofilm microbial composition by dna checkerboard, and serum antibody immunoglobulin-gamma (igg) titers to specific bacteria by immunocheckerboard. baseline characteristics were used to compute estimated glomerular filtration rate defining egfr <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) as impaired renal function in 103 of 5,032 subjects. levels of serum igg to specific oral bacteria were categorized by quartiles (comparing upper vs. lower three) as  high titer and gfr <60 as the dependent variable in logistic regression models, adjusting for multiple comparisons (hotelling t(2)) and traditional risk factors  including age, race, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, body mass, waist-to-hip ratio, serum triglycerides, hdl, and ldl cholesterol. results: high levels of serum igg to selected periodontal pathogens including porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and aggregobacter actinomycetemcomitans were associated with  an increased odds for gfr <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), adjusted odds ratio ranging from  1.6 to 1.8 and p < 0.05. conclusions: elevated igg to periodontal pathogens is significantly associated with impaired kidney function, independent of traditional risk factors. prospective studies are necessary to confirm these findings.

TI  == carpegen real-time polymerase chain reaction vs. anaerobic culture for periodontal pathogen identification.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to compare two methods of microbiological diagnosis, anaerobic bacterial culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr), for the detection of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and treponema denticola. methods: seventy-two samples were collected from 18 patients who were suffering from aggressive periodontitis. the data obtained were compared for the two methods. results: the results obtained with real-time pcr were different from those obtained with bacterial culture. the detection differences were 3% for a. actinomycetemcomitans, 8.33% for p. intermedia, and 12.5% for f. nucleatum. however, the differences for p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were 51.39% and 36.11%, respectively. no comparison was possible for t. denticola because it cannot be identified in culture. the variations found were the result of the better detection level (10(2) pathogens)  of the pcr probe. unlike bacterial culture, pcr allows the detection of t. denticola, which does not forming colonies and is oxygen sensitive. for f. nucleatum, t. forsythia and p. gingivalis, the real-time pcr technique was more sensitive than culture. conclusion: good results were obtained with the real-time pcr technique for the six periopathogens targeted. this method seems to be indicated for its simplicity, rapidity and reproducibility but it cannot analyze  data for an antibiotic susceptibility test. the periodontist must therefore choose one of these two methods according to his specific clinical objective: to  obtain rapid, specific detection even with weak initial concentrations (but for targeted periopathogens only) or to be non-specific and analyze the pathological  activity with an antibiogram.

TI  == [pathogenic potential of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia, the red bacterial complex associated with periodontitis].
AB  == periodontitis are mixed bacterial infections leading to destruction of tooth-supporting tissues, including periodontal ligament and alveolar bone. among over 500 bacterial species living in the oral cavity, a bacterial complex named "red complex" and made of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia has been strongly related to advanced periodontal lesions. while periodontopathogenic bacteria are the primary etiologic factor of periodontitis, tissue destruction essentially results from the host immune response to the bacterial challenge. members of the red complex are gram negative anaerobic bacteria expressing numerous virulence factors allowing bacteria to colonize the subgingival sites, to disturb the host defense system, to invade and destroy periodontal tissue as well as to promote the immunodestructive host response. this article reviews current knowledge of the pathogenic mechanisms of  bacteria of the red complex leading to tissue and alveolar bone destruction observed during periodontitis.

TI  == denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis as a diagnostic tool in periodontal microbiology.
AB  == bacteria play an important role in the initiation and progression of periodontal  diseases and are part of a biofilm, which can contain over 100 different species. the aim of the present study was to show the potential of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) as a tool for the detection of clinically relevant species and to compare the results of detection by dgge with those by pcr and culturing.  hybridization of the bands from the dgge profiles with species-specific probes was developed to confirm the band positions in the marker obtained with reference strains. the sensitivities of dgge compared to those of cultivation for the detection of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and tannerella forsythensis were 100, 100, 88, and 100%, respectively; and the sensitivities of dgge compared to those of pcr were 100, 90, 88, and 96%, respectively. dgge as a diagnostic tool could easily be extended to other species, as shown for treponema denticola, which could be detected in 48% of the samples. three different groups of a. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes  could be distinguished by dgge (i.e., a group comprising serotypes a, d, e, and f; a group comprising serotype b; and a group comprising serotype c). amplicons from p. gingivalis and t. denticola migrated to the same position in the gel, and p. intermedia produced multiple bands. in the present study we show that the dgge profiles represent clinically relevant species which can be detected by hybridization with species-specific probes. with dgge, large numbers of samples can be analyzed for different species simultaneously, and dgge may be a good alternative in periodontal microbial diagnostics.

TI  == periodontal infections and cardiovascular disease: the heart of the matter.
AB  == background: oral infection models have emerged as useful tools to study the hypothesis that infection is a cardiovascular disease (cvd) risk factor. periodontal infections are a leading culprit, with studies reporting associations between periodontal disease and cvd. the results, however, have varied, and it often is unclear what conclusions can be drawn from these data. summary: an association exists between periodontal disease and cvd. it is unknown, however, whether this relationship is causal or coincidental. early studies predominantly  used nonspecific clinical and radiographic definitions of periodontal disease as  surrogates for infectious exposure. while most studies demonstrated positive associations between periodontal disease and cvd, not all studies were positive,  and substantial variations in results were evident. more recent studies have enhanced the specificity of infectious exposure definitions by measuring systemic antibodies to selected periodontal pathogens or by directly measuring and quantifying oral microbiota from subgingival dental plaque. results from these studies have shown positive associations between periodontal disease and cvd. conclusions: evidence continues to support an association among periodontal infections, atherosclerosis and vascular disease. ongoing observational and focused pilot intervention studies may inform the design of large-scale clinical  intervention studies. recommending periodontal treatment for the prevention of atherosclerotic cvd is not warranted based on scientific evidence. periodontal treatment must be recommended on the basis of the value of its benefits for the oral health of patients, recognizing that patients are not healthy without good oral health. however, the emergence of periodontal infections as a potential risk factor for cvd is leading to a convergence in oral and medical care that can only benefit the patients and public health.

TI  == levels of matrix metalloproteinases-8 and -9 with simultaneous presence of periodontal pathogens in gingival crevicular fluid as well as matrix metalloproteinase-9 and cholesterol in blood.
AB  == background and objectives: to investigate the levels of matrix metalloproteinase  (mmp) -8 and -9 with the simultaneous presence of periodontal pathogens in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) as well as mmp-9 and cholesterol in blood. although bacterial pathogens are required to initiate the periodontal disease process, in some individuals the reaction to bacteria may lead to an excessive host response, resulting in a general inflammatory response. methods: mmp-9 and lipids were analyzed from the blood samples of 33 subjects with a 16-year history and oral health records of periodontal disease as well as from 31 periodontally healthy controls. information was obtained on education, body mass index, and family history of atherosclerosis. gcf was taken to determine mmp-8 and mmp-9 levels, and bacterial samples were simultaneously collected for polymerase chain  reaction assessment of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. analysis of variance, chi-squared test, and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the results. results: demographic data showed significant differences between patients and controls in  smoking (p < 0.01), body mass index (p < 0.05), family history of atherosclerotic disease (p < 0.01), and education (p < 0.01). significant differences were also observed in oral health data, in the detection of p. gingivalis (p < 0.001), p. intermedia (p < 0.01), p. nigrescens (p < 0.001), and t. forsythia (p < 0.001) and in the levels of mmp-8 and mmp-9 in gcf between patients and controls. t. forsythia[odds ratio(or) 10.1; p = 0.001] and age (or 5.54; p = 0.008) appeared to be the main independent predictors for high mmp-8 in gcf. patients had significantly higher total cholesterol (p < 0.01), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 0.05), and triglycerides (p < = 0.01) than controls. plasma levels of mmp-9 were significantly higher in patients than in controls (p = 0.001). conclusions: specific periodontal microorganisms appeared to induce host  response, with increased release of mmp-8 and mmp-9 in gingival pockets as well as of mmp-9 in plasma, possibly triggering its up-regulation in blood.

TI  == antibacterial effect of electrolyzed water on oral bacteria.
AB  == this study investigated the antibacterial effect of electrolyzed water on oral bacteria both in vitro and in vivo. tap water was electrolyzed in a water vessel  using platinum cell technology. the electrolyzed tap water (called puri-water) was put in contact with five major periodontopathogens or toothbrushes contaminated with these bacteria for 30 sec. in addition, puri-water was used as  a mouthwash for 30 sec in 16 subjects and the antibacterial effect on salivary bacteria was evaluated. puri-water significantly reduced the growth of all periodontopathogens in culture and on toothbrushes, and that of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in saliva, when compared to the effect of tap water. it also significantly reduced mutans streptococci growing on mitis salivarius-bacitracin  agar. our results demonstrate that the electrolyzed tap water is effective as a mouthwash and for toothbrush disinfection.

TI  == microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue after plaque accumulation: an experimental study in humans.
AB  == background: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect  of the absence of tongue hygiene on the microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue. methods: ten volunteers (aged 19 to 22 years) entered the study at baseline and were instructed to abstain from tongue cleaning for 7 days, followed by a period  of 3 days without any kind of oral hygiene. subsequently, a period of 21 days of  washout was employed, and this protocol was repeated three times. microbiological samples were obtained from the dorsum of the tongue at baseline and at the end of the period of coating accumulation and analyzed using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: the species found in highest mean counts at baseline and day 10 were prevotella melaninogenica and veillonella parvula. the mean bacterial total counts enhanced significantly during the study (from 17.1x10(6) to 33.7x10(6)). proportions of red and blue complexes and levels of 18 species also increased after the period of coating accumulation, including several periodontal pathogens, such as prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus constellatus, tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and p. melaninogenica. conclusion: the tongue surface could be an important reservoir for periodontal pathogens and may play a  role in the recolonization of tooth surfaces and in the etiology of oral halitosis.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis vesicles enhance attachment, and the leucine-rich repeat bspa protein is required for invasion of epithelial cells by "tannerella forsythia".
AB  == the human oral cavity harbors more than 500 species of bacteria. periodontitis, a bacterially induced inflammatory disease that leads to tooth loss, is believed to result from infection by a select group of gram-negative periodontopathogens that includes porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and "tannerella forsythia" (opinion on name change from tannerella forsythensis pending; formerly bacteroides forsythus). epithelial cell invasion by periodontopathogens is considered to be an important virulence mechanism for evasion of the host defense responses. further, the epithelial cells with invading bacteria also serve as reservoirs important in recurrent infections. the present study was therefore undertaken to address the epithelial cell adherence and invasion properties of t. forsythia and the role of the cell surface-associated protein bspa in these processes. further, we were interested in determining if p. gingivalis, one of the pathogens frequently found associated in disease, or its outer membrane vesicles (omvs) could modulate the epithelial cell adherence and invasion abilities of t. forsythia. here we show that epithelial cell attachment and invasion by t. forsythia are dependent on the bspa protein. in addition, p. gingivalis or its omvs enhance the attachment and invasion of t. forsythia to epithelial cells. thus, interactions between these two bacteria may play important roles in virulence by promoting host cell attachment and invasion.

TI  == association of eubacterium nodatum and treponema denticola with human periodontitis lesions.
AB  == background: the purpose of the present investigation was to compare the levels, proportions and percentage of sites colonized by 40 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples from periodontally healthy subjects and patients with  chronic periodontitis to seek possible pathogens other than the consensus pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. method: subgingival  plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 635 subjects with chronic periodontitis and 189 periodontally healthy subjects. the samples were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (total samples = 21,832). mean counts, % dna probe counts and percentage of sites colonized at >10(5) were determined for each species in each subject and then averaged in each clinical group. significance of difference between groups was determined using the mann-whitney test. association between combinations of species and periodontal status was examined by stepwise logistic regression analysis. analyses were repeated using a subset of subjects from both clinical groups who had proportions of p. gingivalis plus t. forsythia  less than the median (4.42%) found in periodontally healthy subjects. all analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: for the 824 subjects the consensus pathogens p. gingivalis and t. forsythia as well as eubacterium nodatum and treponema denticola had significantly higher mean counts, proportions and percentage of sites colonized in samples from subjects with periodontitis than from periodontally healthy subjects. there were significantly more capnocytophaga gingivalis, streptococcus gordonii and veillonella parvula in periodontally healthy subjects. e. nodatum, t. denticola, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus intermedius, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii all had higher  counts and proportions in diseased than healthy subjects who had low proportions  of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia. logistic regression analysis indicated that the same species groups were associated with disease status after adjusting for the proportions of the other species. conclusions: this investigation confirmed the strong association of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia with chronic periodontitis and emphasized a strong association of e. nodatum and t. denticola  with periodontitis whether in the presence or absence of high levels of the consensus pathogens. other species, including s. oralis, eikenella corrodens, s.  intermedius and f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, were associated with disease when p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were present in low proportions.

TI  == antimicrobial therapy using a local drug delivery system (arestin) in the treatment of peri-implantitis. i: microbiological outcomes.
AB  == objectives: to assess the microbiological outcome of local administration of minocycline hydrochloride microspheres 1 mg (arestin) in cases with peri-implantitis and with a follow-up period of 12 months. material and methods:  after debridement, and local administration of chlorhexidine gel, peri-implantitis cases were treated with local administration of minocycline microspheres (arestin). the dna-dna checkerboard hybridization method was used to detect bacterial presence during the first 360 days of therapy. results: at day 10, lower bacterial loads for 6/40 individual bacteria including actinomyces gerensceriae (p<0.1), actinomyces israelii (p<0.01), actinomyces naeslundi type 1 (p<0.01) and type 2 (p<0.03), actinomyces odontolyticus (p<0.01), porphyromonas gingivalis (p<0.01) and treponema socranskii (p<0.01) were found. at day 360 only the levels of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were lower than at baseline (mean difference: 1x10(5); se difference: 0.34x10(5), 95% ci: 0.2x10(5) to 1.2x10(5); p<0.03). six implants were lost between days 90 and 270. the microbiota was successfully controlled in 48%, and with definitive failures (implant loss and major increase in bacterial levels) in 32% of subjects. conclusions: at study endpoint, the impact of arestin on a. actinomycetemcomitans was greater than the impact on other pathogens. up to day 180 reductions in levels of tannerella forsythia, p. gingivalis, and treponema denticola were also  found. failures in treatment could not be associated with the presence of specific pathogens or by the total bacterial load at baseline. statistical power  analysis suggested that a case control study would require approximately 200 subjects.

TI  == efficiency of the vector -system compared with conventional subgingival debridement in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == objective: to assess the efficacy of the novel ultrasonic vector -system system for subgingival debridement and to compare the results with conventional periodontal instrumentation in vitro and in vivo. material and methods: forty extracted human teeth were treated in vitro: vector -system with polishing (vp) and abrasive fluid (va), conventional ultrasonic system (u) and hand instrument (h). at intervals of 40 s, calculus removal was assessed using a 3d laser scanning device. eight single-rooted teeth were treated in vivo with the vector -system or hand instruments. subgingival plaque samples were obtained for microbiological evaluation. after extraction, residual calculus was assessed by means of digitized planimetry. results: in vitro efficiency of hand instruments was statistically higher compared with the conventional ultrasonic system (p < 0.05) and the vector -system with no difference between u and va (p > 0.05) and va and vp (p > 0.05). residual calculus following in vivo instrumentation was not different in the vector and the hand instrument group (p > 0.05) but treatment time with the vector -system was statistically higher (p < 0.05). a similar reduction of periopathogenic bacteria could be observed in both groups. conclusion: using the vector -system, root surfaces can be debrided as thoroughly as with conventional instruments. however, treatment is more time consuming than  conventional debridement.

TI  == periodontal healing after non-surgical therapy with a modified sonic scaler: a controlled clinical trial.
AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to compare the clinical and microbiological healing outcomes following non-surgical periodontal therapy using a modified sonic scaler system versus scaling and root planing (s/rp) with hand instruments. material and methods: the study comprised 20 chronic periodontitis patients. using a split-mouth design, both treatment modalities were randomly applied to one quadrant of the upper and lower jaws. clinical and microbiological parameters were assessed at baseline, 4 weeks, and 6 months after treatment. furthermore, post-operative hypersensitivity was investigated. the wilcoxon signed-rank test (alpha = 0.05) was used for statistical analysis. results: with both therapy methods, periodontal conditions showed statistically significant clinical and microbiological improvements after 4 weeks and 6 months. hypersensitive teeth were found only 4 weeks after s/rp. besides a significantly better bleeding on probing reduction in deep s/rp sites and less time required for root instrumentation by the sonic scaler, no other clinical and microbiological parameters revealed significant differences between sites treated with the sonic  scaler or s/rp. conclusion: the sonic scaler system and s/rp seem to provide similarly favourable periodontal healing results, although in deep pockets s/rp appeared to achieve a better resolution of inflammation.

TI  == treponema denticola in disseminating endodontic infections.
AB  == treponema denticola is a consensus periodontal pathogen that has recently been associated with endodontic pathology. in this study, the effect of mono-infection of the dental pulp with t. denticola and with polymicrobial "red-complex" organisms (rc) (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and t. denticola) in inducing disseminating infections in wild-type (wt) and severe-combined-immunodeficiency (scid) mice was analyzed. after 21 days, a high  incidence (5/10) of orofacial abscesses was observed in scid mice mono-infected with t. denticola, whereas abscesses were rare in scid mice infected with the red-complex organisms or in wild-type mice. splenomegaly was present in all groups, but only mono-infected scid mice had weight loss. t. denticola dna was detected in the spleen, heart, and brain of mono-infected scid mice and in the spleen from mono-infected wild-type mice, which also had more periapical bone resorption. the results indicate that t. denticola has high pathogenicity, including dissemination to distant organs, further substantiating its potential importance in oral and linked systemic conditions.

TI  == antibody response after single-visit full-mouth ultrasonic debridement versus quadrant-wise therapy.
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to compare serum antibody responses to periodontal pathogens after single-visit full-mouth ultrasonic debridement and quadrant-wise therapy. material and methods: thirty-six subjects with chronic periodontitis were randomized into three groups: quadrant-wise debridement in four visits, one-visit full-mouth debridement with water and with povidone iodine. blood samples were collected before and immediately after treatment and 1, 3 and 6 months post-therapy. serum antibody titres and avidity to porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) and thiocyanate elisa, respectively. results: igg titres to p. gingivalis significantly decreased at 1, 3 and 6 months in full-mouth debridement with water group, while significant reductions were seen only at 3 and 6 months after quadrant-wise debridement. both full-mouth groups showed significant reduction in igg titres to a. actinomycetemcomitans at 3 and 6 months. significant increases in antibody avidity to p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans were noted 3 months following full-mouth debridement with povidone. conclusion: both full-mouth and quadrant treatments generally resulted  in a decrease in antibody titres and increase in antibody avidity. full-mouth debridement induced an earlier reduction of igg titre to p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans, than quadrant-wise therapy.

TI  == bacterial profile and burden of periodontal infection in subjects with a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome.
AB  == background: periodontitis has been identified as a potential risk factor in cardiovascular diseases. it is possible that the stimulation of host responses to oral infections may result in vascular damage and the inducement of blood clotting. the aim of this study was to assess the role of periodontal infection and bacterial burden as an explanatory variable to the activation of the inflammatory process leading to acute coronary syndrome (acs). methods: a total of 161 consecutive surviving cases admitted with a diagnosis of acs and 161 control subjects, matched with cases according to their gender, socioeconomic level, and smoking status, were studied. serum white blood cell (wbc) counts, high- and low-density lipoprotein (hdl/ldl) levels, high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hsc-rp) levels, and clinical periodontal routine parameters were studied. the subgingival pathogens were assayed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. results: total oral bacterial load was higher in the subjects with acs (mean difference: 17.4x10(5); sd: 10.8; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 4.2 to 17.4; p<0.001), and significant for 26 of 40 species including porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, and treponema denticola. serum wbc counts, hsc-rp levels, streptococcus intermedius, and streptococcus sanguis,  were explanatory factors to acute coronary syndrome status (nagelkerke r2=0.49).  conclusion: the oral bacterial load of s. intermedius, s. sanguis, streptococcus  anginosus, t. forsythensis, t. denticola, and p. gingivalis may be concomitant risk factors in the development of acs.

TI  == inhibitory effects of macrocarpals on the biological activity of porphyromonas gingivalis and other periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == background/aims: macrocarpals, which are phloroglucinol derivatives contained in  eucalyptus leaves, exhibit antimicrobial activity against a variety of bacteria including oral bacteria. this study examined effects of macrocarpals a, b, and c  on periodontopathic bacteria, especially porphyromonas gingivalis. methods: macrocarpals a, b, and c were purified from a 60% ethanol-extract of eucalyptus globules leaves. to investigate antibacterial activity, representative periodontopathic bacteria were cultured in media with or without various amounts  of macrocarpals; subsequently, the optical density at 660 nm was measured. macrocarpal inhibition of p. gingivalis arg- and lys-specific proteinases was assessed by spectrofluorophotometric assay and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. the effect of macrocarpals on p. gingivalis binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads was examined with  (3)h-labeled p. gingivalis. results: growth of p. gingivalis was inhibited more strongly than growth of prevotella intermedia or prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola by macrocarpals, however, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum were much more resistant. macrocarpals inhibited p. gingivalis arg- and lys-specific proteinases in a dose-dependent manner. the enzyme-inhibitory effect of macrocarpals was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis in which hemoglobin degradation by p. gingivalis proteinase was inhibited by macrocarpals. p. gingivalis binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads was also strongly attenuated by macrocarpals. conclusions: macrocarpals a, b and c demonstrated antibacterial activity against periodontopathic bacteria. among tested bacteria,  p. gingivalis displayed the greatest sensitivity to macrocarpals; additionally, its trypsin-like proteinase activity and binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite  beads were inhibited by macrocarpals. these results indicate that eucalyptus leaf extracts may be useful as a potent preventative of periodontal disease.

TI  == identification of oral bacteria associated with crevicular epithelial cells from  chronic periodontitis lesions.
AB  == bacterial invasion of host epithelial cells plays an important role in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases; however, the interactions between subgingival species and the gingival crevice cells are not fully understood. this study determined the prevalence of a group of oral bacterial species on or in epithelial cells derived from periodontal pockets and the gingival crevice of subjects with periodontitis. samples of epithelial cells were obtained from 120 sites with periodontal pockets > or =4 mm and 92 periodontally healthy sites from 49 patients (mean age 46.3+/-1.4 years; 43% males) with chronic periodontitis. bacteria in or on epithelial cells were separated from unattached bacteria by percoll density-gradient centrifugation. the presence and levels of 33 oral species were determined in epithelial cell samples by whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard method. the most frequently detected species were porphyromonas gingivalis (42%), treponema denticola (38%), prevotella intermedia  (37%), streptococcus intermedius (36%), campylobacter rectus (35%), streptococcus sanguinis (35%) and streptococcus oralis (34%). species of actinomyces were found in low prevalence and levels. the data indicated that there were more micro-organisms on or in epithelial cells obtained from periodontal pockets than  from healthy sulci; however, no significant differences regarding the percentage  and level of any specific species were found between these sites. veillonella parvula, s. oralis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mitis tended to be more prevalent in sites without disease. these findings demonstrated that a wide  range of oral species may be detected on or in crevicular epithelial cells from sites with periodontitis and from periodontally healthy sulci.

TI  == langerhans' cell histiocytosis in a 5-year-old girl: evidence of periodontal pathogens.
AB  == background: langerhans' cell histiocytosis (lch) is a rare disorder characterized by langerhans' cell proliferation in various organs or tissues. when periodontal  tissue is involved, clinical manifestations can vary from gingival recession and  pocket formation to severe alveolar bone loss. this case report describes periodontal pathogens found in the pockets of involved primary teeth. methods: a  5-year-old girl with lch presented with loose teeth. intraoral examination and radiographs revealed deep pockets and severe bone loss around all primary molars. bacterial samples were obtained from saliva and subgingival plaque and analyzed for the presence of five periodontopathic bacteria using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. due to severe periodontal destruction, all primary molars  were extracted, and a gingival biopsy was taken from tooth t to confirm the diagnosis of lch. results: the biopsy specimen revealed the histologic features of lch. the patient was diagnosed as having periodontitis as a manifestation of lch. pcr results of subgingival plaque from lch-affected molars indicated the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia. however, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was absent from these teeth. no tested bacteria were found  in the non-affected anterior teeth. conclusions: the bacteria commonly associated with periodontal disease were detected in subgingival plaque samples from this lch patient. more microbiological data are required to understand the role of these bacteria in lch-associated periodontal destruction.

TI  == local oxygen therapy for treating acute necrotizing periodontal disease in smokers.
AB  == background: the main aim of treatment for acute necrotizing periodontal disease is fast and effective reduction of anaerobic destructive microorganisms to avoid  periodontal damage. the effect of adjunctive local oxygen therapy in the treatment of necrotizing periodontal disease was examined in this study. methods: thirty patients with acute necrotizing periodontal disease were treated with the  systemic antibiotics amoxicillin, clavulanic acid, and metronidazole. in 15 out of 30 patients, adjunctive local oxygen therapy was administered. the patients were followed from the first to 10th day of treatment with clinical and bacteriological examinations. the clinical examination registered gingival bleeding, periodontal probing depth, and attachment loss; to follow up microbiological colonization of the periodontal sulcus, five representative bacteria were registered by a semiquantitative dna polymerase chain reaction test. results: in both groups of patients, colonization with prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis, and treponema denticola was initially positive. none of these three microorganisms were completely eradicated in any of the patients in the group without oxygen therapy within the first 10 days of treatment. in the group with adjunctive oxygen therapy, all patients either showed a reduction in or complete eradication of the microorganisms, resulting in more rapid clinical restitution with less periodontal destruction. conclusions: adjunctive oxygen therapy results in early eradication of pathogenic anaerobic microorganisms in cases of acute necrotizing periodontal disease. the damage to periodontal tissue is reduced.

TI  == relationship of serum advanced glycation end products with deterioration of periodontitis in type 2 diabetes patients.
AB  == background: a close relationship between diabetes and chronic periodontitis has been demonstrated. we previously found that porphyromonas gingivalis with the type ii fima gene is an infectious factor closely associated with the deterioration seen in diabetic periodontitis patients. in the present study, we examined whether other biomarkers are related to the development and deterioration of periodontitis often seen in type 2 diabetic individuals. methods: a total of 97 type 2 diabetes patients with and without periodontitis were recruited, and their periodontal and diabetic conditions were analyzed. the  ratio (%) of teeth with an attachment loss >5 mm among all teeth in each subject  was used as an index of periodontal deterioration. peripheral blood was tested for levels of glycated hemoglobin (hba1c), advanced glycation end products (ages), c-reactive protein (crp), and cytokines (tumor necrosis factor [tnf]-alpha and interleukin [il]-1beta). subgingival plaque samples were also examined for the occurrences of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella  forsythensis, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia. results: serum ages were significantly associated with deterioration of periodontitis, whereas no other serum biochemical marker or bacterial occurrence showed a clear relationship with that condition. conclusion: ages may be factors associated with diabetic periodontitis and may be useful as biomarkers that reflect such deterioration.

TI  == clinical and microbiological effects of different antimicrobials on generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == aim: to evaluate and compare the effects of adjunctive metronidazole plus amoxicillin, doxycycline and metronidazole on clinical and microbiological parameters in patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis. material and methods: forty-three patients participated in this randomized clinical trial divided into four groups. six weeks after scaling and root planning (srp), groups 1-3 received adjunctive metronidazole, plus amoxicillin, doxycycline and metronidazole respectively, and group 4 acted as controls. clinical recordings concerning probing depth, probing attachment level and bleeding on probing were performed at baseline, 6 weeks after srp and 6 months from baseline. subgingival  samples were analysed using the 'checkerboard' dna-dna hybridization for porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola. results: all treatments resulted in improvement of clinical parameters (anova p > 0.05). systemic administration of metronidazole plus amoxicillin or metronidazole resulted in statistically significant greater reduction of the proportion of sites > 6 mm than srp (z-test, p < 0.05). these antimicrobials yielded a significant effect on levels of important periodontal pathogens for 6 months. conclusion: adjunctive metronidazole plus amoxicillin or metronidazole alone (when a.actinomycetemcomitans is not involved) is effective in deep pockets of aggressive periodontitis patients.

TI  == periodontal infections and coronary heart disease: role of periodontal bacteria and importance of total pathogen burden in the coronary event and periodontal disease (corodont) study.
AB  == background: chronic inflammation from any source is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. periodontitis is a possible trigger of chronic inflammation. we investigated the possible association between periodontitis and coronary heart disease (chd), focusing on microbiological aspects. methods: a total of 789 subjects (263 patients with angiographically confirmed, stable chd and 526 population-based, age- and sex-matched controls without a history of chd) were included in the coronary event and periodontal disease (corodont) study. subgingival biofilm samples were analyzed for periodontal pathogens actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and treponema denticola using dna-dna hybridization. the need for periodontal treatment in each subject was assessed using the community periodontal index of treatment needs (cpitn). the main outcome measures included total periodontal pathogen burden, number of the various periodontal pathogens in the subgingival biofilm, and periodontal treatment needs (according to the cpitn). results: in multivariable analyses, we  found a statistically significant association between the periodontal pathogen burden (log10 of the sum of all pathogens) (odds ratio [or], 1.92; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.34-2.74; p<.001) or the number of a actinomycetemcomitans in periodontal pockets (log10) (or, 2.70; 95% ci, 1.79-4.07; p<.001) and the presence of chd. in addition, a statistically significant association between an  increase in mean cpitn score by 1 and the presence of chd (or, 1.67; 95% ci, 1.08-2.58; p = .02) was observed. conclusions: our findings suggest an association between periodontitis and presence of chd. periodontal pathogen burden, and particularly infection with a actinomycetemcomitans, may be of special importance.

TI  == detection of bacterial dna in atheromatous plaques by quantitative pcr.
AB  == this is the first study to analyze atheromatous plaques for the presence of bacterial dna from ten species, including periodontal species and chlamydia pneumoniae. we examined 129 samples of dna extracted from atheromas from 29 individuals for the presence of bacterial 16s rdna sequences from ten different species: porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), tannerella forsythensis, eikenella corrodens, prevotella intermedia, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans, treponema denticola and c. pneumoniae. all determinations were made using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) methods employing sybr green. species from the bacteroides family were found in about 17% of the young but approximately 80% in elderly patients. almost half of the samples contained dna from a. a. and c. pneumoniae, although the proportion of the latter was minimal. s. aureus and s. epidermidis were found with the lowest frequency, 5 and 10%, respectively. s. mutans was found in approximately 20% of the samples. the proportions of each bacterial species were calculated relative to the total amount of prokaryotic dna. the data support our previous findings of an association between periodontal organisms and vascular inflammation. we conclude  that dna from oral infectious agents is commonly found in atheromas from young but especially from elderly subjects, and that the contribution of c. pneumoniae  to the inflammation may be minimal.

TI  == description of the subgingival microbiota of periodontally untreated mexican subjects: chronic periodontitis and periodontal health.
AB  == background: recent studies have suggested that changes in the prevalence and/or proportion of distinct microorganisms characterize the subgingival microbial profiles of populations around the world. at present, no information is available on the subgingival microbiota of mexican subjects. the purpose of the present study was to determine the microbial composition of subgingival plaque in mexican subjects with untreated chronic periodontitis. methods: a total of 44 chronic periodontitis and 20 periodontally healthy subjects (who were currently non-smokers) were selected. clinical measurements including plaque accumulation,  gingival erythema, bleeding on probing, suppuration, probing depth, and attachment level were recorded at six sites of every tooth. up to 28 subgingival  plaque samples were obtained from each subject and individually analyzed to determine the levels, proportion, and prevalence of 40 microbial species using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythensis were the only species that presented higher mean levels in periodontitis subjects. the proportions of p. gingivalis (p<0.001), t. forsythensis (p<0.01), and red complex species (p. gingivalis, t. forsythensis, and t. denticola; p<0.001) as a group were also significantly higher in periodontitis subjects. periodontally healthy subjects harbored a significantly larger proportion of actinomyces species (p<0.05). no significant differences were detected in the percentage of carriers  of any of the species tested. conclusions: our results revealed that the subgingival microbiota of untreated chronic periodontitis mexican subjects was characterized by increases in the level, prevalence, and proportion of classic periodontal pathogens. however, the prevalence and proportion of specific microbial species varied significantly from the results of other reports on subjects from different geographical locations.

TI  == anti-inflammatory activity of a high-molecular-weight cranberry fraction on macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathogens.
AB  == periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting oral tissues. the continuous, high production of cytokines by host cells triggered by periodontopathogens is thought to be responsible for the destruction of tooth-supporting tissues. macrophages play a critical role in this host inflammatory response to periodontopathogens. the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of non-dialyzable material prepared from cranberry juice concentrate on the pro-inflammatory cytokine response of macrophages induced by lipopolysaccharides (lps) from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and escherichia coli. interleukin-1 beta (il-1beta), il-6, il-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), and regulated on activation normal t-cell expressed and secreted (rantes) production by macrophages treated with the cranberry fraction prior to stimulation by lps was evaluated by elisa. our results clearly indicate that the cranberry fraction was  a potent inhibitor of the pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses induced by lps. this suggests that cranberry constituents may offer perspectives  for the development of a new therapeutic approach to the prevention and treatment of periodontitis.

TI  == inhibitory effect of weissella cibaria isolates on the production of volatile sulphur compounds.
AB  == aims: the objective of this study was to characterize the inhibitory effects of weissella cibaria isolates on volatile sulphur compounds (vsc) production both in vitro and in vivo. material and methods: we isolated and identified three hydrogen peroxide-generating lactobacilli from children's saliva, and assessed their inhibitory effects on vsc production and fusobacterium nucleatum proliferation. clinical studies were conducted with 46 subjects in order to measure the vsc of their mouth air. results: these lactobacilli were identified as w. cibaria. these isolates inhibited the production of vsc by f. nucleatum (p<0.05). the concentration of f. nucleatum was decreased by 5-log cycles as a result of exposure to the w. cibaria strains (p<0.05), whereas the catalase-treated w. cibaria cultures exerted no evident inhibitory effects on f.  nucleatum replication. in the clinical studies, gargling with one isolate resulted in a significant reduction in the levels of h2s and ch3sh by approximately 48.2% (p<0.01) and 59.4% (p<0.05), respectively. conclusions: these results indicate that w. cibaria isolates possess the ability to inhibit vsc production under both in vitro and in vivo conditions, demonstrating that they bear the potential for development into novel probiotics for use in the oral cavity.

TI  == effect of a stannous fluoride dentifrice on the sulcular microbiota: a prospective cohort study in subjects with various levels of periodontal inflammation.
AB  == objectives: to assess the effects of an experimental 0.454% stannous fluoride (snf2) dentifrice on the oral sulcular microbiota in patients with various stages of oral diseases using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. material and methods:  in the present one-month, single center, single product, prospective cohort trial, 37 adults (mean age 37.6) were assigned to one of four oral health condition cohorts with seven to 10 subjects each: 1. mild gingivitis, 2. marked generalized gingivitis to moderate periodontitis, 3. caries-prone and 4. treated  moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis in supportive periodontal care. all four groups were asked to use the test dentifrice and a power toothbrush twice a  day for one minute during a four-week test period. before and after the trial period, plaque indices (pii, silness and loe, 1964) and gingival indices (gi, loe and silness, 1963) were recorded. subgingival plaque samples were collected from  all patients at baseline, as well as after two and four weeks. these samples were analyzed for content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: as a result of the only one minute brushing with the stannous fluoride dentifrice, the mean pii at baseline was significantly lower (p < 0.05) from the mean pii at four weeks. no statistically significant differences were found between premolar and molar mean values. moreover, no statistically significant differences were found between the mean gi at baseline and at four weeks. the microbiological analysis showed that at baseline subjects in groups 2  and 4 had significantly higher bacterial loads of bacteria than groups 1, and 3 (i.e. a. actinomyctemcomitans p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola. over the study period, the total bacterial load did not change in groups 2, 3 and 4. in groups 1 and 3, however, an increase in the loads of streptococci spp. were noticed (p < 0.05) including s. mitis, s. intermedius, and s. sanguis (p < 0.01)  suggesting an increase in the presence of early colonizing and health associated  bacteria. conclusion: one minute brushing with a 0.454% stannous fluoride dentifrice did--after four weeks--not affect the subgingival microbial profiles in patients with moderate periodontitis and treated moderate to advanced periodontitis. however, the sulcular microbial profiles of mild gingivitis and caries-prone patients were affected, indicating a shift towards a gingival health associated microbiota in the sulcular region of patients not affected by attachment loss. running head: effect of stannous fluoride on sulcular microbiota.

TI  == inhibition of periodontopathogen-derived proteolytic enzymes by a high-molecular-weight fraction isolated from cranberry.
AB  == background: porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola are three major aetiological agents of chronic periodontitis. the strong proteolytic activities of these bacteria are critical to their survival since their energy source is obtained from peptides and amino acids derived from  proteins. in addition, proteases are important factors contributing to periodontal tissue destruction by a variety of mechanisms, including direct tissue degradation and modulation of host inflammatory responses. objectives: the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of non-dialysable material (ndm)  prepared from cranberry juice concentrate on the proteolytic activities of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and t. denticola. methods: the effect of ndm on gingipain and dipeptidyl peptidase iv (dpp iv) activities of p. gingivalis, trypsin-like activity of t. forsythia and chymotrypsin-like activity of t. denticola was evaluated using synthetic chromogenic peptides. in addition, the capacity of p. gingivalis to degrade fluorescein-labelled type i collagen and fluorescein-labelled transferrin in the presence of ndm was evaluated by fluorometry. results: ndm dose-dependently inhibited the proteinases of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and t. denticola as well as type i collagen and transferrin degradation by p. gingivalis. conclusions: these results suggest that ndm has the potential to reduce either the proliferation of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and t. denticola in periodontal pockets or their proteinase-mediated destructive process occurring in periodontitis.

TI  == early colonization of non-submerged dental implants in patients with a history of advanced aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == the aim of the study was to evaluate the early colonization of non-submerged implants over a 6-month period in partially edentulous patients treated for advanced aggressive periodontal disease. in 22 patients treated for advanced aggressive periodontitis and in a supportive maintenance program for a period between 12 and 240 months at implant surgery, a total of 68 non-submerged dental  implants were installed. patients had a plaque score below 20%, and less than 20% of the pockets around the teeth were bleeding on probing (bop). using dna-probes  (micro-ident), the presence and concentration of five periodontal pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), tannerella forsythensis (tf) and treponema denticola  (td)) were determined in the five deepest pockets of the rest dentition pre-operatively and after 6 months as well as five places around each implant 10  days, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after surgery. in each patient, a test to determine the genotype interleukin-1 (il-1) was performed (pst - micro-ident). after 6 months, no difference in microbial composition as compared with baseline  was found around the teeth in five patients, in 12 minute differences and in five patients important differences were observed. ten days after surgery, three patients had a complete similar bacterial composition between teeth and implants. in 14 patients, the composition was fairly similar, while large differences in composition and concentration occurred in five patients. this microbiota around the implants remained almost unchanged over a 6-month period and did not hamper the clinical and radiographic osseointegration and did not lead to peri-implantitis, mucositis or initiation of bone destruction.

TI  == comparison of bacterial plaque samples from titanium implant and tooth surfaces by different methods.
AB  == studies have shown similarities in the microflora between titanium implants or tooth sites when samples are taken by gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) sampling methods. the purpose of the present study was to study the microflora from curette and gcf samples using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method to assess the microflora of patients who had at least one oral osseo-integrated implant and who were otherwise dentate. plaque samples were taken from tooth/implant surfaces and from sulcular gingival surfaces with curettes, and from gingival fluid using filter papers. a total of 28 subjects (11 females) were enrolled in the study. the mean age of the subjects was 64.1 years (sd+/-4.7). on average, the implants studied had been in function for 3.7 years (sd+/-2.9). the  proportion of streptococcus oralis (p<0.02) and fusobacterium periodonticum (p<0.02) was significantly higher at tooth sites (curette samples). the gcf samples yielded higher proportions for 28/40 species studies (p-values varying between 0.05 and 0.001). the proportions of tannerella forsythia (t. forsythensis), and treponema denticola were both higher in gcf samples (p<0.02 and p<0.05, respectively) than in curette samples (implant sites). the microbial  composition in gingival fluid from samples taken at implant sites differed partly from that of curette samples taken from implant surfaces or from sulcular soft tissues, providing higher counts for most bacteria studied at implant surfaces, but with the exception of porphyromonas gingivalis. a combination of gcf and curette sampling methods might be the most representative sample method.

TI  == the transmission of anaerobic periodontopathic organisms.
AB  == the oral microbial flora is unique, and available evidence indicates that it is passed vertically from parents to children. in this investigation, we used a chairside assay for the n-benzoyl-dl-arginine-2-naphthylamide (bana)-sensitive enzyme found in porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythensis, to determine the prevalence of these bana-positive species in young children and their caregivers. we predicted that if the bana enzyme was found in  plaque samples of children, it would also be present in the plaque samples of the caregivers. forty-four percent of 150 children had at least one plaque sample positive for the bana enzyme. if the caregiver was bana-positive, the odds of the child also being bana-positive was 35 times more than for a child with a bana-negative caregiver, after adjustment for the child's age and papillary bleeding score (pbs). other significant predictors were the pbs of children (p <  0.001), a history of periodontal disease, and the ages of the caregivers (p < 0.001).

TI  == resolution of furcation bone loss after non-surgical root canal treatment: application of a peptidase-detection kit for treatment of type i endoperiodontal  lesion.
AB  == here, we report the management of a type i endoperiodontal lesion with furcation  bone loss. a 59-year-old female attended our hospital with the chief complaint of mobility of tooth 46 and recurrent gingival swelling around the tooth. she previously received dental treatment from two dentists, but her condition did not improve. the tooth manifested the symptoms of typical periodontitis, such as gingival swelling, tooth mobility, pus discharge from the periodontal pocket and  furcation bone loss. the tooth had no caries and the pulp reacted to an electric  pulp test. careful examination of the gingiva revealed traces of dental fistula.  x-ray examination via a gutta percha inserted into the fistula revealed that furcation bone loss was associated with the periapical lesion. we diagnosed a type i endoperiodontal lesion, and applied periocheck, a detection kit for peptidase-producing bacteria, to check for decreases in bacteria in the furcation and root canals. soon after non-surgical root canal treatment, the condition of tooth 46 improved without periodontal treatment. after confirming a negative score with periocheck, the root canal was filled. after 3 months, the furcation bone loss was on the way to recovery. these results indicate that proper diagnosis and confirmation of a decrease in root canal bacteria are important for treating endoperiodontal lesions.

TI  == streptococci dominate the diverse flora within buccal cells.
AB  == previously, we reported that intracellular actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythensis were present within buccal  epithelial cells from human subjects, as lesser components of a polymicrobial flora. in this study, we further characterized that intracellular flora by using  the same double-labeling techniques to identify fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, oral campylobacter species, eikenella corrodens, treponema denticola, gemella haemolysans, granulicatella adiacens, and total streptococci within buccal epithelial cells. all those species were found within buccal cells. in every case, species recognized by green-labeled species-specific probes were accompanied by other bacteria recognized only by a red-labeled universal probe. streptococci appeared to be a major component of the polymicrobial intracellular  flora, being present at a level from one to two logs greater than the next most common species (g. adiacens). this is similar to what is observed in oral biofilms, where diverse species interact in complex communities that often are dominated by streptococci.

TI  == involvement of periodontopathic anaerobes in aspiration pneumonia.
AB  == increasing evidence has linked the anaerobic bacteria forming periodontopathic biofilms with aspiration pneumonia in elderly persons. in experiments designed to eliminate the potent respiratory pathogens forming biofilms in the oral cavity, we have shown that the mechanical and chemical oral cleansing using povidone-iodine effectively reduced the detection rates and numbers of methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus species, streptococcus pneumoniae, and haemophilus influenzae in patients scheduled to undergo oral surgery requiring endotracheal intubation. we confirmed the pathogenicity of periodontopathic anaerobic bacteria for aspiration pneumonia in an experimental mouse model. based upon the finding of the coexistence of porphyromonas gingivalis with treponema denticola in chronic periodontitis lesions, we innoculated a mixed culture of p.  gingivalis and t. denticola into the mouse trachea; the resulting infection induced inflammatory cytokine production and caused pneumonia. in another series  of investigations, professional oral health care (pohc), mainly cleansing administered by dental hygienists once a week for 24 months to elderly persons requiring daily care, resulted in the reduction of the number of total anaerobes, candida albicans, and staphylococcus species and in the number of cases of fatal  aspiration pneumonia. we also found that the pohc treatment of elderly persons for 6 months in the winter season reduced the salivary levels of protease, trypsin-like activity, and neuraminidase and also decreased the frequency of influenza cases.

TI  == biofilm formation by the periodontopathic bacteria treponema denticola and porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == background: periodontitis develops as a result of the interaction of the host with subgingival plaque bacteria. both porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola are frequently associated together in these oral biofilms. methods: the molecular basis for in vitro biofilm formation was investigated for p. gingivalis 381, t. denticola 35405, and mixtures of the two organisms using microtiter plate assays. in addition, the biofilms were examined following confocal laser scanning microscopy. results: p. gingivalis 381, but not t. denticola strains, formed biofilms in vitro. this property was dependent, in part, on the strain 381 fima,  ppk, and usp genes. microarray and northern blot analyses suggested that the expression of the ppk gene was required for maximal expression of the uspa gene.  p. gingivalis 381 formed synergistic biofilms when incubated with t. denticola strains. this process was dependent upon the strain 381 rgpb and fima genes as well as the t. denticola flge and cfpa genes. conclusions: p. gingivalis 381 formed synergistic biofilms with t. denticola 35405. these results may be relevant to the previous observations that the two organisms are frequently observed together in subgingival plaque with the spirochetes localized to the exterior of the oral biofilms. it is suggested that other such synergistic effects may also occur between other plaque bacteria.

TI  == distribution of 10 periodontal bacteria in saliva samples from japanese children  and their mothers.
AB  == objective: we analyzed the distribution of 10 periodontal bacteria species (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, and treponema denticola) in children, and then compared their distribution in those children and their mothers, with special attention given to three of the species  known as the red complex (p. gingivalis, t. forsythensis, and t. denticola) whose presence has been shown to be associated with conditions related to periodontal diseases. methods: one hundred thirteen pairs of children and their mothers were  randomly selected from patients treated at the pedodontic clinic of osaka university dental hospital. saliva samples were taken at the second visit prior to receiving professional tooth brushing instruction. genomic dna was extracted from each saliva sample, followed by a polymerase chain reaction assay with species-specific sets of primers. results: a. actinomycetemcomitans was the most  frequently detected species in the mothers, followed by c. sputigena, p. gingivalis, and t. forsythensis, while c. sputigena had the highest detection rate, followed by a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. denticola in the children. the  detection rate of the red complex species in children whose mothers possessed the same species was significantly higher than in those whose mothers did not possess them. conclusions: our results indicate a correlation between the presence of periodontal bacteria in children and their mothers, while the presence of red complex bacteria in children was highly associated with that in their mothers.

TI  == inflammatory responses of a macrophage/epithelial cell co-culture model to mono and mixed infections with porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia.
AB  == accumulated evidence points to porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia as three major etiologic agents of chronic periodontitis. epithelial cells and macrophages play a major role in the host response to periodontopathogens, and the secretion of inflammatory mediators and matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) by these host cells is believed to contribute to periodontal tissue destruction. the aim of this study was to investigate the inflammatory response of a macrophage/epithelial cell co-culture model following  mono or mixed infections with the above three periodontopathogens. an in vitro co-culture model composed of epithelial-like transformed cells (hela cell line) and macrophage-like cells (phorbol myristic acid-differentiated u937 monocytic cell line) was challenged with whole cells or lipopolysaccharides (lps) of p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia, individually and in combination. following stimulation, the production of interleukin-1 beta (il-1beta), il-6, il-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), regulated on activation normal t cell expressed and secreted (rantes), prostaglandin e2 (pge2), and mmp-9 were quantified by enzyme-linked immunoassays. we observed that mono or mixed infections of the co-culture model induced the secretion of il-1beta, il-6, il-8, pge2, and mmp-9. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia induced an increase in rantes secretion, whereas t. denticola alone or in combination resulted in a significant decrease in rantes levels. all lps challenges induced an increase in chemokine, mmp-9, and pge2 production. no synergistic effect on the production of cytokines, chemokines, pge2, and mmp-9 was observed for any of the bacterial or lps mixtures tested. this study supports the view that p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia may induce high levels of pro-inflammatory mediators and mmp-9 in periodontal lesions, thus contributing to the progression of periodontitis.

TI  == analytical epidemiology of periodontitis.
AB  == aims: to review the literature related to the analytical epidemiology of periodontitis generated over the past decade. this review does not deal with descriptive epidemiologic studies of the prevalence, extent and severity of periodontitis with respect to global geography, but focuses exclusively on analytical epidemiology issues, including the challenges posed by the use of different case definitions across studies, current theories and models of disease progression, and risk factors associated with the onset and progression of periodontitis. methods: relevant publications in the english language were identified after medline and pubmed database searches. findings and conclusions:  there is a conspicuous lack of uniformity in the definition of periodontitis used in epidemiologic studies, and findings from different research groups are not readily interpretable. there is a lack of studies that specifically address the distinction between factors responsible for the onset of periodontitis versus those affecting its progression. colonization by specific bacteria at high levels, smoking, and poorly controlled diabetes have been established as risk factors for periodontitis, while a number of putative factors, including specific gene polymorphisms, have been identified in association studies. there is a clear need for longitudinal prospective studies that address hypotheses emerging from the cross-sectional data and include established risk factors as covariates along with new exposures of interest. intervention studies, fulfilling the "targeting"  step of the risk assessment process, are particularly warranted. obvious candidates in this context are studies of the efficacy of elimination of specific bacterial species and of smoking cessation interventions as an alternative to the traditional broad anti-plaque approach in the prevention and control of periodontitis. ideally, such studies should have a randomized-controlled trial design.

TI  == impact of smoking on the clinical, microbiological and immunological parameters of adult patients with periodontitis.
AB  == objectives: the aim of the current study was to assess the impact of smoking on the clinical indices, the humoral immune response and the detection frequency of  putative periodontal pathogens in patients with periodontitis cross-sectionally and following therapy. material and methods: clinical measurements, subgingival plaque samples, gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) and sera were collected from 40 untreated patients with moderate-to-advanced chronic periodontitis before and after treatment over a period of 6 months. the treatment consisted of the initial therapy of scaling and root planing. smoking status was self-reported and was confirmed by cotinine enzyme inhibition assay (ceia). whole-mouth clinical measurements were recorded with a manual periodontal probe at baseline (bas) and  at 6 months (ras). selected-site analyses were performed on the deepest site in each quadrant before and after therapy and clinical indices were recorded with an electronic pressure-sensitive probe. gcf sample volume was quantified using the periotron 6000. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was utilized to determine the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and tanerella forsythensis in subgingival plaque. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay examined the systemic antibody titres to these bacteria, and thiocyanate disassociation determined the  antibody avidity to these organisms. results: at baseline, smokers showed significantly less gingival inflammation and lower gcf volume compared with non-smokers. after treatment, a compromised clinical outcome was noted for smokers in terms of pocket depth reduction and gain in attachment levels. no significant differences in the detection of putative periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque existed between smokers and non-smokers. a consistent trend was noted in that smokers had lower sera immunoglobulin g antibody titres to these organisms before and after treatment (statistically significant for a. actinomycetemcomitans). this pattern was less clear when antibody avidities were  considered, revealing only small differences, if any, between the two groups of patients. conclusion: current data indicate that smokers with periodontal disease have a suppressed inflammatory response, a significantly less favourable clinical outcome and seem to have an altered host antibody response to antigenic challenge than non-smokers. in contrast, the subgingival microflora of smokers appears similar to that of non-smokers.

TI  == detection of bacteria in endodontic samples by polymerase chain reaction assays and association with defined clinical signs in italian patients.
AB  == background/aims: the presence of selected bacteria (enterococcus faecalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola) in infected root canals was studied using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays, and the association of bacteria with clinical signs of endodontic disease was assessed. the null hypothesis, that no difference could be observed between clinical signs of apical periodontitis and a specific bacterial  strain, was tested. methods: microbial samples were obtained from 62 teeth in 54  patients with endodontic disease. for each tooth, clinical data including patient symptoms were collected. teeth were categorized by diagnosis as having acute apical periodontitis (aap, teeth with clinical symptoms but no periapical radiolucency, n=22), chronic apical periodontitis (cap, teeth with radiolucency but no clinical symptoms, n=15) or exacerbated apical periodontitis (eap, teeth with symptoms and radiolucency, n=25). seventy-one percent of cases were primary  endodontic infections, and 29% were recurrent ('secondary') endodontic infections (failing cases). pcr assays were used to detect the presence of the selected bacteria. results: t. denticola and e. faecalis were each detected in 15 of 62 samples (24%), p. gingivalis in 8 samples (13%), p. intermedia in 5 samples (8%), and t. forsythensis in 4 samples (7%). t. denticola was detected in 56% of teeth  with eap. e. faecalis was found in 60% of teeth with cap and in 72% of teeth with secondary infection. statistical analysis demonstrated an association of cap and  secondary endodontic infection with the presence of e. faecalis. (p<0.01). eap was associated with the presence of t. denticola (p<0.01). conclusion: t. denticola was associated with symptomatic endodontic disease in the presence of apical bone resorption. e. faecalis was associated with treatment failures. we suggest that these species may play critical roles in endodontic pathology.

TI  == synergistic biofilm formation by treponema denticola and porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == biofilm formation is an important step in the etiology of periodontal diseases. in this study, in vitro biofilm formation by treponema denticola and porphyromonas gingivalis 381 displayed synergistic effects. confocal microscopy demonstrated that p. gingivalis attaches to the substratum first as a primary colonizer followed by coaggregation with t. denticola to form a mixed biofilm. the t. denticola flagella mutant as well as the cytoplasmic filament mutant were  shown to be essential for biofilm formation as well as coaggregation with p. gingivalis. the major fimbriae and arg-gingipain b of p. gingivalis also play important roles in biofilm formation with t. denticola.

TI  == oral bacteria in the occluded arteries of patients with buerger disease.
AB  == objective: recent studies have suggested that infectious organisms play a role in vascular diseases. in this study, to explore a possible link between oral infection and buerger disease, we investigated whether oral (periodontal) bacteria were present in occluded arteries removed from patients with characteristic buerger disease. methods: fourteen male patients with a smoking history who had developed characteristics of buerger disease before the age of 50 years were included in this study. occluded arteries, including superficial femoral (n = 4), popliteal (n = 2), anterior tibial (n = 4), and posterior tibial (n = 4) arteries, were removed and studied. a periodontist performed a periodontal examination on each patient and collected dental plaque and saliva samples from them at the same time. the polymerase chain reaction method was applied to detect whether seven species of periodontal bacteria--porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, campylobacter rectus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia , and prevotella nigrescens--were present in the occluded arteries and oral samples. in addition,  arterial specimens from seven control patients were examined by polymerase chain  reaction analysis. results: dna of oral bacteria was detected in 13 of 14 arterial samples and all oral samples of patients with buerger disease. treponema denticola was found in 12 arterial and all oral samples. campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis, and prevotella nigrescens were found in 14% to 43% of the arterial samples and 71% to 100% of the oral samples. a pathologic examination revealed that arterial specimens showed the characteristics of an intermediate-chronic-stage or chronic-stage lesion of buerger disease. all 14 patients with buerger disease had moderate to severe periodontitis. none of the control arterial samples was positive for periodontal bacteria. conclusions: this is the first study to identify oral microorganisms in the lesions of buerger disease. our findings suggest a possible etiologic link between buerger disease and chronic infections  such as oral bacterial infections.

TI  == prevalence of putative periodontopathogens in subgingival dental plaques from gingivitis lesions in korean orthodontic patients.
AB  == the objective of this study was to detect and compare the presence of periodontopathogens in the subgingival plaques of gingivitis lesions in adults who wore fixed orthodontic appliances, as opposed to adults who did not wear any  orthodontic appliances. thirty-six individuals participated in this study. nineteen of these subjects did not wear any orthodontic appliances, and these subjects comprised the control group. the other 17 individuals had been wearing fixed orthodontic appliances for at least 3 months each. after a periodontal examination, we collected subgingival plaque samples from the gingivitis lesions  of each patient. using pcr based on 16s rdna, we detected the presence of 6 putative periodontopathogenic species, treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (formerly bacteroides forsythus), prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. with regard to the presence of individual periodontopathogens, we found that t. forsythia, t. denticola, and p. nigrescens were significantly more common in the  samples obtained from the orthodontic patients than in the samples obtained from  the non-orthodontic patient controls. our results indicate that the local changes associated with the wearing of fixed orthodontic appliances may affect the prevalence of periodontopathogens in subgingival dental plaques.

TI  == association between coinfection of porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and treponema denticola and periodontal tissue destruction  in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: the association between the infection of porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and treponema denticola in chronic periodontitis (cp) and the severity of periodontal disease remains to be elucidated. the aim of this study was to investigate the subgingival infection frequencies of three periodontopathic bacteria in chinese cp patients and to evaluate the correlations between infection by these bacteria and periodontal destruction. methods: a multiple pcr assay using primers derived from 16srdna genes of p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. denticola was established to measure simultaneously the presence of the three microbes in 162 subgingival samples from 81 chinese cp patients. results: the positive rates of p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. denticola in the subgingival samples  were 84.6%, 83.3% and 88.3%, respectively. of the subgingival samples, 68% revealed the coinfection of all the three microbes. the infection rates with p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans or t. denticola alone was 5.9% (1/17), 17.6% (3/17) and 76.5% (13/17), respectively. a close association was present between the a. actinomycetemcomitans infection and gingival index (gi) (p < 0.01), but not between p. gingivalis or t. denticola infection and gi (p > 0.05). p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans were more frequently detectable in middle and deep pockets than in shallow ones (p < 0.01), while t. denticola was found remarkably often in deep pockets (p < 0.05). the coinfection rate of the three microbes was significantly higher in sites with severe periodontitis than in those with mild periodontitis (p < 0.01). conclusions: the multiple pcr established in this study can be used as a sensitive and specific method to simultaneously detect all three microbes in subgingival samples. a. actinomycetemcomitans infection may be associated with cp and play an important role in the periodontal tissue destruction. the coinfection of p. gingivalis, a.  actinomycetemcomitans and t. denticola can cause more serious periodontal destruction than infection of any one or two of the three microbes.

TI  == predictive value of clinical and microbiological parameters for the treatment outcome of scaling and root planing.
AB  == objectives: to compare the clinical and microbiological outcome of non-surgical periodontal therapy after 6 months with data obtained after hygienic phase or 6 weeks after completion of non-surgical therapy, in order to evaluate the value of clinical and microbiological parameters to predict treatment success. material and methods: clinical and microbiological data were available from 271 sites in 10 systemically healthy non-smokers with moderate-to-advanced chronic periodontal disease (24-32 sites per individual). subgingival plaque samples were tested for  the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis and treponema denticola using rna probes. results: stepwise multiple linear regression analysis revealed a significant impact of the number of sites with visible plaque index >1 after hygienic phase on the bleeding tendency of a subject at month 6 (p<0.01). furthermore, an association could be demonstrated between the number of residual pockets (pd>3 mm) 6 months after therapy and the number of bleeding sites and suppurating sites after hygienic phase (p=0.016). six weeks after therapy, the mean total bacterial loads had a significant impact on the bleeding tendency of a subject at month 6 (p<0.01). although the average numbers of sites with persisting p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, t. forsythensis and t. denticola seemed to be very similar 6 weeks and 6 months after therapy, large variations were noted between subjects, and therefore the microbiological status of a subject at week 6 could not predict the status at month 6. conclusions: the present study showed a limited potential  of microbiological tests, performed after hygienic phase or shortly after non-surgical periodontal therapy, to predict the clinical outcome 6 months later, but confirmed the importance of an establishment of perfect oral hygiene before non-surgical therapy.

TI  == [critical assessment of microbiological diagnostics in periodontal diseases with  special focus on porphyromonas gingivalis].
AB  == periodontitis is caused by an opportunistic infection with pathogenic microorganisms of the oral biofilm. in this paper, we discuss the usefulness of microbial diagnostics with respect to the differential diagnosis or the treatment approaches of periodontal diseases. several diagnostic techniques, based on morphological, enzymatic, cultural, genetic or antigenetic properties have been established to analyze the microbial flora. among the bacterial species some virulent genotypes of p. gingivalis play an important role in the etiology of periodontitis. expression of fimbriae or different proteases have been identified as potential virulence factors of this gram negative anaerobic rod. to date a characterization of virulence of specific strains or a correlation between expression of different virulence factors and distinct periodontal conditions, however, is missing. therefore, the importance of a routine identification of p.  gingivalis still needs further evaluation.

TI  == microarrays complement culture methods for identification of bacteria in endodontic infections.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the microbial composition of necrotic root canals using culture methods and microarray technology. twenty uniradicular  teeth with radiographic evidence of periapical bone loss and with no previous endodontic treatment were selected for this study. for molecular diagnosis a dna  chip with 20 different species-specific, 16s-rdna-directed catcher probes was used. the microorganisms most frequently detected by the dna chip were: micromonas micros, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp., tannerella forsythia, treponema  denticola, veillonella parvula, eubacterium nodatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces odontolyticus, and streptococcus constellatus. as expected, additional important bacterial taxa were found by culture analysis, but microorganisms such as t. forsythia and t. denticola could not be identified. in  conclusion, microarrays may provide significant additional information regarding  the endodontic microbiota by detecting bacterial species that are otherwise difficult or impossible to culture.

TI  == [study on the detection of p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. denticola and the correlation between coinfections of the microbes and levels of  chronic periodontitis lesion].
AB  == objective: to establish a 16s rdna multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) for  simultaneously detecting p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. denticola in clinical specimens of chronic periodontitis and to study the correlation between different modes of infection and severity of the disease. methods: periodontal pocket specimens from 152 patients with mild, moderate or advanced chronic periodontitis and gingival sulcus specimens from 30 periodontally healthy individuals were collected and placed in 200 microl lysis buffer. the specimens were incubated in 100 degrees c for 10 min and 10 microl of the supernatant was directly used as pcr template. dnas from p. gingivalis strain atcc33277, a. actinomycetemcomitans strain y4, t. denticola strain fm and e. coli strain dh5alpha were used as positive and negative controls in pcr with all of which were prepared by routing phenol-chloroform method. a multiplex pcr assay, using three sets of primers specific to 16s rdna genes of the three anaerobes, was developed to detect the specimens. the target amplification fragments from 3 cases of pcr products positive for all the three anaerobes were sequenced after t-a cloning. chi-square test was applied to analyze the correlation between different coinfection of the three anaerobes and severity of the disease. results: the established 16s rdna multiplex pcr assay was able to detect p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. denticola at a minimum of 10, 20 and  20 cells, respectively. in comparison with the reported corresponding sequences,  similarities of the nucleotide sequences from the three anaerobes 16s rdna amplification fragments were as high as 99.45%, 97.08% and 96.59%, respectively.  of the 30 periodontally healthy gingival sulcus specimens, only one (3.3%) positive for p. gingivalis and two (6.7%) for a. actinomycetemcomitans could be identified but all of the rest were negative. in the 152 cp periodontal pocket specimens, 147 cases (96.7%) were positive for p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and/or t. denticola, respectively, and 5 cases (3.3%) were  negative for all the three anaerobes. the positive rate of p. gingivalis detection (91.5%, 139/152) was significantly higher than those of a. actinomycetemcomitans (72.4%, 110/152) and t. denticola (80.9%, 123/152) (chi(2)  = 7.07, 18.67; p < 0.01). 89.8% of the specimens from patients showed coinfections with two (26.5%) or three anaerobes (63.3%), and the coinfection rates in the specimens from moderate and advanced cp were remarkably higher than  that from mild cp (chi(2) = 10.43, p < 0.01). conclusion: the 16s rdna multiplex  pcr established in this study showed high sensitivity and specificity, which could be used to detect p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. denticola  in clinical specimens. cp was an disease caused by multiple pathogenic microbes while the synergistic pathopoiesis of the three microbes was closely related to the severity of the disease.

TI  == debridement and local application of tetracycline in the management of persistent periodontitis. clinical and microbiological results after 12 months.
AB  == aim: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological efficacy of local delivery of tetracycline in persistent periodontal lesions after topical therapy. methods: a total of 44 bilateral pockets 4-5 mm deep and bleeding on probing were selected in 11 non-smokers patients, 22 treated by scaling and root planing plus tetracycline fibres (test sites) and 22 with scaling and root planing alone (control sites) in a split-mouth design. bleeding  on probing, probing depth and clinical attachment level were recorded at baseline, 6 and 12 months postoperatively. the prevalence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus and treponema denticola was monitored by pcr at baseline, fibres removal, 6 and 12 months following treatment. results: the improvements in clinical parameters were greater in the tetracycline than in the control group. the reduction of bleeding on probing scores was 86.4% and 40.9%, the decrease of  probing depth was 2.25 mm and 1.19 mm and the gain of clinical attachment level was 2.04 mm and 0.64 mm for test and control groups, respectively, over the 12-month period. the adjunctive use of tetracycline consistently resulted in a lower percentages of sites with detectable levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia and p. gingivalis, while no differences were detected between treatments in the prevalence of t. denticola and b. forsythus. the pathogens could be eliminated from 3 periodontal pockets by debridement alone and from 12 sites by tetracycline at 12 months. conclusions: tetracycline local delivery gave the greatest advantage in the long-term treatment of periodontal persistent lesions.

TI  == prostaglandin e(2) is a main mediator in receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappab ligand-dependent osteoclastogenesis induced by porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and treponema socranskii.
AB  == background: periodontitis is an inflammatory disease that often leads to destruction of alveolar bone; a number of bacteria in subgingival plaque are associated with bone destruction in periodontitis. to understand the mechanism of how periodontopathogens induce osteoclastogenesis, we determined which mediators  are involved in the osteoclastogenesis. methods: we investigated effects of sonicates from three periodontopathic bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and treponema socranskii, on osteoclast formation in a co-culture system of mouse calvaria-derived osteoblasts and bone marrow cells. the osteoclast formation was determined by tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (trap) staining. the expression of the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa b ligand (rankl), prostaglandin e(2) (pge(2)) and osteoprotegerin (opg) in mouse  calvaria-derived osteoblasts was determined by immunoassay. results: each bacterial sonicate induced the osteoclast formation in the co-culture system. these bacterial sonicates increased the expression of rankl and pge(2), and decreased the expression of opg in osteoblasts. the addition of opg, an inhibitor of rankl, in the co-culture completely suppressed the osteoclastogenesis that was stimulated by each bacterial sonicate. indomethacin, which is an inhibitor of pge(2) synthesis, reduced more than 88% of the osteoclast formation induced by each bacterial sonicate. indomethacin inhibited more than 80% of rankl expression in osteoblasts induced by t. denticola and t. socranskii, and 59% by p. gingivalis. indomethacin completely recovered the depression of opg expression in osteoblasts by t. denticola and t. socranskii to the level of the untreated osteoblasts. indomethacin recovered the reduction of opg expression by p. gingivalis to 67%. conclusion: these findings suggest that the osteoclastogenesis by p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. socranskii is mediated by a rankl-dependent pathway and that pge(2) is a main factor in the pathway by the enhancing of rankl expression and the depression of osteoprotegerin, a rankl inhibitor.

TI  == clinical and microbiological evaluation of the effectiveness of the nd:yap laser  for the initial treatment of adult periodontitis. a randomized controlled study.
AB  == background: enhancement of the results obtained by scaling and planing is most often sought by using antimicrobial therapies. laser beams have been shown to be  bactericidal and could possibly target pathogens more effectively and with fewer  compliance problems than antiseptic solutions. methods: thirty subjects 20-60 years old presenting periodontal pockets at least 5 mm deep in each quadrant received initial periodontal treatment. the study had a split-mouth design. the control side (srp) only received scaling and planing, and the test side (srp+laser) was treated by both srp and nd:yap (yttrium aluminum perovskite doped with neodym) laser. clinical conditions were evaluated at day 0 and day 90 using  the plaque index, gingival index, bleeding on probing, pocket probing depth, and  clinical attachment level. microbial sampling was also performed on days 0 and 90, and the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis, and treponema denticola was analysed by polymerase chain reaction in a commercial laboratory. post-operative pain or discomfort was measured by the patient using a linear visual scale. pearson's chi-squared test was used to compare bacterial presence.  results: there was no statistically significant difference concerning clinical data between test and control groups at baseline. both treatments enhanced the clinical situation compared to baseline; however, results were not significantly  different between the two groups. t. forsythensis was the organism most numerous  in both groups. though initial treatment diminished the numbers of all the pathogens it did not do so statistically significantly. differences between test  and control groups were very small and bore no significance. evaluation of the post-operative pain did not reveal any differences between the groups. conclusions: scaling and root planing was effective in reducing levels of plaque, inflammation, and bleeding upon probing. no additional advantage was achieved by  using the nd:yap laser.

TI  == proportional distribution of the red complex and its individual pathogens after sample storage using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique.
AB  == background: information on the impact of sample storage prior to analysis by dna  methods is limited. aims: to investigate the effect of microbial sample storage on bacterial detection and proportional distribution of the red complex and its individual pathogens. material and methods: subgingival plaque samples were analysed by (1) immediate processing, (2) after storage at +4 degrees c for 6 weeks, (3) after storage at -20 degrees c for 6 months or (4) after storage at -20 degrees c for 12 months using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: proportional distribution of the red complex did not differ between the  first three protocols. however, the total bacterial dna for pathogens studied decreased significantly in protocols 3 and 4. relative amounts of tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola remained stable in the second protocols and changed in an unpredictable way if stored for 6 or 12 months. conclusions: results from samples stored for maximum 6 months at -20 degrees c with high proportional amounts of the red complex and t. denticola may  be used as an indicator of persistence. all bacterial samples for dna extraction  should be processed following a standardized storage protocol (i.e. samples stored at +4 degrees c for maximum 6 weeks) in order to get comparable qualitative and quantitative results for total dna, bacterial complexes and individual pathogens. most representative results are yielded if processing and hybridization could be performed immediately after sampling.

AB  == loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp), a novel nucleic acid amplification method, was developed for the rapid detection of the major periodontal pathogens  porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. the lamp method amplifies dna with high specificity, efficiency, and rapidity under isothermal conditions using a set of four specially designed primers and a dna polymerase with strand displacement activity. in this study, we initially designed the primers for lamp assays to detect these bacteria and evaluated the specificity and sensitivity of these assays. the specificities of the primers for these bacteria were examined using various oral bacteria and various reaction times. the lower detection limits of the 60-min lamp reaction without loop primers were 1 microg/tube for p. gingivalis, 10 fg/tube for t. forsythia, and 1  ng/tube for t. denticola. addition of the loop primers for each bacterium improved the detection specificities and sensitivities by several magnitudes. furthermore, lamp assays were applied to the rapid detection of these periodontal pathogens in clinical specimens, and the results were compared with those of conventional pcr detection. the results of the lamp assays corresponded to those  of conventional pcr assays. these results indicate that the lamp assay is an extremely rapid, highly sensitive, specific method. this method is very useful for the rapid detection of periodontopathic bacteria and the diagnosis of periodontal disease.

TI  == detection of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans but not bacteria of the red complex in aortic aneurysms by multiplex polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == background: aortic aneurysms affect an increasing number of elderly patients and  cause considerable morbidity and mortality. the understanding of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of aortic aneurysms is unclear and little is known about the role of microorganisms in the development of the condition. the aim of  the present study was to examine aortic aneurysm samples for the presence of four putative periodontal pathogens: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythensis, and porphyromonas gingivalis. methods: fifty-six samples from the aneurysm wall were obtained from patients undergoing aneurysm repair. dna was extracted from tissue by conventional methods. universal eubacterial primers for general detection of bacteria and species specific primers for detection of the periodontal pathogens were used to amplify part of the 16s rrna gene by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: bacterial dna was  detected in 50 of the 56 aneurysm samples (89.2%). a. actinomycetemcomitans was found in four samples (7.1%). none of the samples was positive for t. denticola,  t. forsythensis, or p. gingivalis. conclusion: bacteria are commonly present in aortic aneurysms and may play a role in the development of the condition. periodontal pathogens are also present.

TI  == molecular analysis of human oral microbiota.
AB  == objectives: the application of molecular, mainly 16s ribosomal rna (rrna)-based approaches enables researchers to bypass the cultivation step and has proven its  usefulness in studying the microbial composition in a variety of ecosystems, including the human oral cavity. in this mini-review, we describe the impact of these culture-independent approaches on our knowledge of the ecology of the human oral cavity and provide directions for future studies that should emphasize the role of specific strains, species and groups of microbes in periodontal disease.  materials and methods: recent findings are summarized to elucidate the relationship between periodontal disease and human oral microbiota, including as-yet-to-be-cultured organisms. results: the real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method was developed to detect and quantify periodontopathic bacteria, such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis (formerly bacteroides forsythus) and treponema denticola. the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique allowed enumeration of large numbers of species in very large numbers of samples. 16s rrna gene clone library analysis revealed the diversity of human oral microbiota  and the existence of as-yet-to-be-cultured organisms that are presumed periodontal pathogens. in addition, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis was applied for assessment of diversity of human oral microbiota. conclusion: culture-independent approaches are useful for studying the microbial ecology in the human oral cavity and should be useful in the future to elucidate the etiology of periodontal disease.

TI  == high production of methyl mercaptan by l-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane lyase from treponema denticola.
AB  == methyl mercaptan is derived from l-methionine by the action of l-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane lyase (metase) and is a major component of oral malodor. this compound is highly toxic and is thought to play an important role in periodontal disease. we found that treponema denticola, a member of the subgingival biofilm at periodontal disease sites, produced a large  amount of methyl mercaptan even at low concentration of l-methionine. metase activity in a cell-free extract from t. denticola was detected by two-dimensional electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions, and the protein spot that exhibited high metase activity was identified using a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer. the identified gene produced a metase with a k(m) value for l-methionine (0.55mm) that is much lower  than those of metases previously identified in the other organisms. this result suggests that t. denticola is an important producer of methyl mercaptan in the subgingival biofilm.

TI  == dna probe identification of bacteria colonizing internal surfaces of the implant-abutment interface: a preliminary study.
AB  == background: currently, there is limited knowledge concerning the specific genus and species of bacteria that may colonize internal surfaces of the implant-abutment interface (iai) of two-stage dental implants. the purpose of this study was to use dna probe analysis to identify those periodontopathic bacteria that may inhabit the internal surfaces and healing abutment screw-threads of the iai of dental implants in situ. methods: following osseointegration, bacterial samples for dna probe analysis were obtained from 54  two-stage hydroxyapatite plasma spray-coated implants in 32 patients. using sterile paper points, samples were obtained from the iai of 43 implants and the screw-threads of healing abutments in the other 11 implants. dna probes were available to detect the following microbes: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and treponema denticola. results: all samples taken from healing abutment screw-threads were negative for all target microbes. the aggregate percentage of positive results for each target microbe for samples from internal surfaces of the iai were: 41.9%, a. actinomycetemcomitans, 60.5%, t. forsythensis; 44.2%, c rectus; 60.5%,  e. corrodens; 48.8%, f. nucleatum; 46.5%, p. gingivalis; 55.8%, p. intermedia; and 51.2%, t. denticola. in addition, no significant differences were noted between colonization of individual microbial species when comparing anterior to posterior and maxillary to mandibular implant sites. conclusions: moderate to high levels of eight different periodontopathic microbes inhabiting the internal  surfaces of the iai of 43 two-stage implants in partially edentulous patients were identified by dna probe analysis. the microbes colonized these surfaces within 25 days following the second stage surgery and placement of the healing abutment. in contrast, all samples obtained from screw-threads of 11 healing abutments were dna probe negative. these findings appear to support those of other investigations demonstrating the translocation of bacteria from residual dentition to implants.

AB  == objective: the current investigation evaluated changes in levels and proportions  of 39 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples after scaling and root planing (srp) alone or in combination with systemic metronidazole and/or professional cleaning in subjects with chronic periodontitis. methods: forty-four adult subjects (mean age 45+/-6 years) with periodontitis were randomly assigned  in four treatment groups, a control (c, n=10) that received srp and placebo and three test groups treated as follows: t1 (n=12): srp and metronidazole (m, 400 mg tid) for 10 days; t2 (n=12): srp, weekly professional supragingival plaque removal for 3 months (pc) and placebo; and t3 (n=10): srp, m and pc. subgingival  plaque samples were taken from seven sites per subject at baseline and 90 days post-therapy. counts of 39 subgingival species were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significance of differences over time was determined using the wilcoxon signed ranks test and among groups using ancova. results: the mean counts of the majority of the species were reduced post-therapy in the 4 treatment groups. counts (x 10(5)+/-sem) of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella  forsythensis and treponema denticola were significantly reduced in groups t2 and  t3. levels of beneficial species, such as some actinomyces species, veillonella parvula, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus gordonii were minimally affected in levels when the combined therapy was applied (t3). mean proportions of red complex species decreased from 18.4% at baseline to 3% at 90 days post-therapy in group t3 (p<0.01), from 25.8% to 2.3% in group t2 (p<0.01), from 17.7% to 5.6% in group t1 (p<0.05) and from 19.4% to 8.8% in group c (ns). proportions of the suspected periodontal pathogens from the orange complex were also markedly reduced in groups t2 and t3. conclusions: all treatments reduced counts and proportions of red complex species. adjunctive therapy appeared to have a greater effect and also affected members of the orange complex.

TI  == pro- versus anti-inflammatory cytokine profile in african children with acute oro-facial noma (cancrum oris, noma).
AB  == fresh noma is a severe orofacial necrosis with an astonishingly rapid development. it is seen mainly in malnourished children less than 4 years old from developing countries. cytokines play a central role in oral mucosal inflammation. we therefore studied the relevance of circulating cytokines to noma, and the key microorganisms associated with the lesion. nigerian village children with acute noma (n=68) and their neighborhood village (n=63) as well as  urban (n=45) counterparts of comparable age and free of overt infections were evaluated for serum cytokine levels by elisa. oral bacteria were studied by polymerase chain reaction. evaluation of random cases of the village and noma children showed marked depletion (p<0.05 or 0.001) of the plasma antioxidant micronutrients (retinol, ascorbic acid, zinc) as well as albumin and blood hemoglobin in the latter, relative to the former group. concentrations of the circulating, pro-inflammatory cytokines (il-18, il-6, il-12, il-8, ifn-gamma) and the soluble inhibitors (tnfr-p55, tnfr-p75 and il-1ra) were significantly higher  (p<0.01 or 0.001) in noma children than in the healthy urban children, but less so when compared to their neighborhood village counterparts. the increase in levels of the anti-inflammatory/regulatory cytokines (il-4, il-10 and tgf-beta) was less marked relative to the pro-inflammatory cytokines. bacteria observed at  the highest frequencies in noma lesions were p. intermedia (83%), t. forsythensis (83%), p. gingivalis (50%), c. rectus (50%) and t. denticola (50%). we conclude that noma is an immunopathological response to potent bacterial factors resulting in uncontrolled production of cytokines and possibly other, still unknown, inflammatory mediators.

TI  == mechanisms of porphyromonas gingivalis-induced monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 expression in endothelial cells.
AB  == monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (mcp-1) is expressed in vascular endothelial cells of inflamed gingival tissues and plays an important role in periodontal pathogenesis. endothelial cells produce high levels of mcp-1 in response to porphyromonas gingivalis, an important periodontal pathogen. the present study investigated the mechanisms involved in mcp-1 production by human umbilical vein  endothelial cells (huvec) following infection with p. gingivalis. in contrast to  p. gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus only weakly stimulated mcp-1 production while treponema denticola could not induce mcp-1 in huvec. the mcp-1 production was independent of endogenous interleukin (il)-1alpha as il-1 receptor antagonist treatment did not reduce mcp-1 production by p. gingivalis. meanwhile, antioxidant treatment and inhibition of nad(p)h oxidase significantly reduced mcp-1 production. pharmacological inhibition of p38 mitogen-associated protein (map) kinase, c-jun n-terminal kinase (jnk), nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab) or activator protein-1 (ap-1) also substantially attenuated p. gingivalis-induced mcp-1 expression by huvec. indeed, activation of nf-kappab and ap-1 was observed  in p. gingivalis-infected huvec. these results suggest that mcp-1 expression is upregulated in p. gingivalis-infected endothelial cells via reactive oxygen species, p38 map kinase, jnk, nf-kappab, and ap-1.

TI  == quantitative detection of volatile sulfur compound- producing microorganisms in oral specimens using real-time pcr.
AB  == objective: it is well-known that some periodontopathic bacteria, especially porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia (formerly bacteroides forsythus or tan. forsythensis), and treponema denticola, actively produce volatile sulfur compounds (vscs), such as h2s and ch3sh. we previously reported a qualitative relationship between periodontopathic bacteria and vscs; however, a quantitative analysis of periodontopathic bacteria in oral specimens is required for further characterization of the relationship between oral bacteria and vscs. in this study, we report a real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method for the quantitative analysis of vsc-producing bacteria in oral specimens. subjects and methods: specimens were collected from 22 patients who visited the preventive dentistry and breath odor clinic of kyushu dental college. a real-time pcr assay using the taqman system, based on the 5'-3' exonuclease activity of taq polymerase, was employed for the quantitative analysis of periodontopathic bacteria that produce vscs. results: using real-time pcr, we performed a quantitative analysis of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, tan. forsythia, and t. denticola in the saliva, on the tongue coat, and in the subgingival plaque of patients with oral malodor. conclusion: real-time pcr using the taqman system  can be used for the quantitative analysis of vsc-producing oral bacteria.

TI  == clinical and microbiological effect of scaling and root planing in smoker and non-smoker chronic and aggressive periodontitis patients.
AB  == objectives: to compare the effects of scaling and root planing (srp) on clinical  and microbiological parameters at selected sites in smoker and non-smoker chronic and generalized aggressive periodontitis patients. materials and methods: clinical parameters including probing depth (pd), relative attachment level (ral), and bleeding upon probing (bop), and subgingival plaque samples were taken from four sites in 28 chronic periodontitis (cp) and 17 generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp) patients before and after srp. polymerase chain reaction assays were used to determine the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola. results: both cp and gagp non-smokers had significantly greater reduction in pocket depth (1.0+/-1.3 mm in cp smokers versus 1.7+/-1.4 mm in non-smokers, p=0.007 and 1.3+/-1.0 in gagp smokers versus 2.4+/-1.2 mm in gagp non-smokers, p<0.001) than respective non-smokers, with a significant decrease in tannerella forsythensis in cp sites (smokers 25% increase and non-smokers 36.3% decrease, p<0.001) and prevotella intermedia at gagp sites (smokers 25% reduction versus 46.9% in non-smokers, p=0.028). conclusion: srp was effective in reducing  clinical parameters in both groups. the inferior improvement in pd following therapy for smokers may reflect the systemic effects of smoking on the host response and the healing process. the lesser reduction in microflora and greater  post-therapy prevalence of organisms may reflect the deeper pockets seen in smokers and poorer clearance of the organisms. these detrimental consequences for smokers appear consistent in both aggressive and cp.

TI  == detection of dna from periodontal pathogenic bacteria in biofilm obtained from waterlines in dental units.
AB  == direct person-to-person transmission of periodontal bacteria through saliva has recently been widely reported and dental units have been demonstrated to retract  saliva from patients under treatment and to release it into the mouths of subjects undergoing the next operation. in this study the presence of a group of  periodontal pathogenic bacteria inside waterlines in dental units was investigated using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) based methods. briefly, 18 dental units of three different manufacturers were studied. dental units were divided into two groups according to their prevalent use in routine practice. the first group consisted of nine dental units characterized by the frequent use of high-speed dental hand-pieces directly inside the mouth and in contact with patients' saliva. the second group, as a control, consisted of nine dental units  where high-speed dental hand-pieces were not in use. a one cm section of the waterline tubing connected to the high-speed hand-piece was removed from each dental unit to evaluate the presence of dna of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola. two specimens were positive for prevotella intermedia dna. all the positive results were from samples obtained from dental units categorised in the first group. these findings clearly suggest  that dental units have the potential to transmit periodontal pathogens. manufacturers should be invited to design dental units that incorporate automated devices to disinfect duwls between patients with minimal effort by dental staff.

TI  == clinical effects of scaling and root planing on untreated teeth.
AB  == objective: the aim of this report is to examine whether scaling and root planing  (srp) in one area of the mouth may affect periodontal improvement in untreated areas in the same patient, possibly through systemic effects of treatment. material and methods: twenty patients diagnosed with generalized aggressive periodontitis were randomized into treatment (n=11) and no treatment (n=9) groups. within the treatment group, three quadrants were treated by srp at week 0, 3, 12, and 24, while a single experimental quadrant remained untreated throughout the study. the outcome for all teeth was assessed using clinical parameters, subtraction radiography, and pathogenic bacteria levels in the subgingival flora over the 24-week study period. results: compared with sites in  no treatment patients, the treated sites in the treated patients showed a 1 mm decrease in probing depth (pd) (p<0.01) and a 0.5 mm increase in bone height (p<0.01) by 24 weeks. in untreated sites within treated subjects, however, pds tended to improve (p=0.09) but at a reduced rate compared with treated sites. the levels of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythensis (bacteroides forsythus) remained unchanged in untreated sites while levels of prevetolla intermedia and treponema denticola tended to decrease as compared with controls but did not reach significance. conclusions: this study indicates that untreated sites in treated periodontitis patients show  a trend towards clinical improvement and exhibit reductions in some but not all periodontopathic bacterial species tested.

TI  == periodontal diseases: microbiological considerations.
AB  == the location of plaque-associated gingivitis at the gingival portion of the tooth plays an essential role in its genesis. however, at times local and other host response modifying factors also have an influence. the pathogeny of periodontitis is more complex. the microorganisms that comprise subgingival plaque are capable  of acting directly on periodontal tissues or of modifying the host response, whereas the participation of the plaque per se (normal, decreased, or increased)  is as decisive as the action of the bacteria themselves in the emergence of the disease. different types of periodontitis are associated with specific microorganisms. the most periodontopathogenic are a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and t. forsythensis. periodontitis as a whole, represent the source of complications such as root caries, endoperiodontal processes and periodontal abscesses. they are associated with various illnesses such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, and respiratory infections, amongst others, as well as pathological oral halitosis. the different modalities of pcr are particularly important in the microbiological diagnosis of periodontitis, although on the negative side of things, it must be pointed out that in vitro sensitivity studies cannot be performed using this technique. first line antibiotic treatment of periodontitis  includes amoxicillin/ clavulanic acid, metronidazole (associated or not with amoxicillin) and clindamycin.

TI  == herpesviruses, the missing link between gingivitis and periodontitis?
AB  == herpesviruses appear to assume a major etiopathogenic role in various types of destructive periodontal disease. human cytomegalovirus (hcmv), epstein-barr virus (ebv) and hcmv-ebv co-infection are closely associated with disease-active periodontitis in juveniles and adults, with acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis in children, and with periodontal abscesses. in particular, hcmv reactivation in periodontitis lesions seems to be linked to advancing disease. hcmv infects periodontal monocytes/macrophages and t-lymphocytes, and ebv infects periodontal b-lymphocytes. herpesvirus-infected inflammatory cells generate a great variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines and may possess diminished ability to defend against bacterial challenge. herpesvirus-associated periodontal sites tend to harbor elevated levels of periodontopathic bacteria, including dialister pneumosintes, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, treponema denticola, campylobacter rectus and  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. in summary, the available data suggest that periodontitis occurs more frequently and progresses more rapidly in herpesvirus-infected than in non-infected periodontal sites. an infectious disease model based on herpesvirus-bacteria-host immune response interactions is  presented to explain how a gingivitis lesion or a stable periodontal site with increased probing depth may convert into a tissue-destroying periodontitis lesion.

TI  == identification of early microbial colonizers in human dental biofilm.
AB  == aims: to elucidate the first colonizers within in vivo dental biofilm and to establish potential population shifts that occur during the early phases of biofilm formation. methods and results: a 'checkerboard' dna-dna hybridization assay was employed to identify 40 different bacterial strains. dental biofilm samples were collected from 15 healthy subjects, 0, 2, 4 and 6 h after tooth cleaning and the composition of these samples was compared with that of whole saliva collected from the same individuals. the bacterial distribution in biofilm samples was distinct from that in saliva, confirming the selectivity of the adhesion process. in the very early stages, the predominant tooth colonizers were found to be actinomyces species. the relative proportion of streptococci, in particular streptococcus mitis and s. oralis, increased at the expense of actinomyces species between 2 and 6 h while the absolute level of actinomyces remained unaltered. periodontal pathogens such as tannerella forsythensis(bacteroides forsythus), porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola as well as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were present in extremely low levels at all the examined time intervals in this healthy group of  subjects. conclusion: the data provide a detailed insight into the bacterial population shifts occurring within the first few hours of biofilm formation and show that the early colonizers of the tooth surface predominantly consist of beneficial micro-organisms. significance and impact of the study: the early colonizers of dental plaque are of great importance in the succession stages of biofilm formation and its overall effect on the oral health of the host.

TI  == the microbiological case for adjunctive therapy for periodontitis.
AB  == that chronic periodontitis is an infectious disease is now firmly established, and the primary role of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis and treponema denticola is generally accepted. treatment by mechanical means such as  scaling and root planing or surgery generally results in significant clinical improvement but may not arrest the progress or recurrence of disease. several studies have shown that the probability of achieving lasting stability as measured by the arrest of progressive attachment loss and bone loss by primary mechanical therapy is a function, in major part, of whether pathogenic microorganisms are still present at local subgingival sites at the completion of  active therapy. the infecting bacterial species are susceptible to killing by several antibiotics including, among others, tetracycline-class drugs, amoxicillin and metronidazole as well as by local exposure to chlorhexidine. randomized clinical trials have shown that use of systemically administered antibiotics as an adjunct to mechanical therapies significantly enhances clinical outcomes and stability. several slow-release devices that deliver anti-microbial  drugs directly into periodontal pockets have been developed and are now on the market. use of these devices permits local delivery of long-lasting, high concentrations of doxycycline (atridox) minocycline (arestin), and chlorhexidine  (periochip) directly into periodontal pockets. although these devices differ with regard to ease of use, concentration of drug delivered and length of time high drug concentrations can be maintained, randomized clinical trials have shown that their use as an adjunctive treatment to scaling and root planing results in a significantly greater reduction of periodontal pocket depth and an average increase in clinical periodontal attachment level of about 0.8 mm. gain in clinical attachment is greater in deeper pockets than in shallower pockets. locally delivered adjunctive anti-microbial therapy is an effective means to enhance therapeutic outcomes.

AB  == it is of great importance to understand the distribution of periodontopathogens within family members when considering the risk of periodontitis in children. the purpose of this study was to investigate the distribution of periodontopathogens  among family members. we used the polymerase chain reaction method to test 4,8, and 7 probands with healthy gingiva, gingivitis, and periodontitis, respectively, and their 60 immediate family members. plaque samples were collected from all erupted teeth sites using a sterile toothbrush. in 161 of the 165 positive cases, if a child harbored one of the periodontopathogens then at least one of the parents was also positive for the same bacterium. the prevalence of parent-child  co-infection was 42.9% for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 21.4% for porphyromonas gingivalis, 29.2% for treponema denticola, 59.5% for tannerella forsythensis (bacteroides forsythus) and 16.7% for prevotella intermedia. our results indicate that parents could be an important source of periodontopathogens for the colonization that occurs in their children.

TI  == detection frequency of periodontitis-associated bacteria by polymerase chain reaction in subgingival and supragingival plaque of periodontitis and healthy subjects.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the detection frequencies of 25 bacterial species in subgingival and supragingival plaque of 18 untreated periodontitis subjects and 12 periodontally healthy subjects. genomic dna was extracted from subgingival and supragingival plaque samples, and bacterial detection was performed by polymerase chain reaction of the 16s rrna genes. fourteen bacteria showed no relationship with periodontitis, and 11 of these 14 species were frequently detected (> or =50%) in subgingival plaque in both periodontitis and healthy subjects. nine bacteria such as eubacterium saphenum, prevotella intermedia, and treponema denticola seemed to be related to periodontitis; their  detection frequencies in subgingival plaque samples were higher in periodontitis  than in healthy subjects, but these differences were not statistically significant by multiple comparisons (0.002< or =p<0.05). two species (mogibacterium timidum and porphyromonas gingivalis) were detected significantly  more frequently in subgingival plaque of periodontitis subjects than of healthy subjects (p<0.002), with p. gingivalis being detected only in periodontitis subjects, suggesting that these two species are closely related to periodontitis. there were no significant differences in the detection frequencies of the 25 bacteria between subgingival and supragingival plaque, suggesting that the bacterial flora of supragingival plaque reflects that of subgingival plaque.

TI  == the distribution of periodontopathic bacteria among japanese children and their parents.
AB  == objective and background: it is not well known how periodontopathic bacteria colonize in the oral cavity during childhood. the purpose of this study was to investigate the distribution of periodontopathic bacteria in oral cavities of children and their parents and the relationship between the bacterial findings and clinical parameters. methods: fifty-six children (mean age: 8.3 +/- 3.5, range: 1-15 years), including 15 with deciduous dentition, 26 with mixed dentition and 15 with permanent dentition, and their parents participated in this study. whole saliva and dental plaque of the children and whole saliva of their parents were collected for detection of seven species of periodontopathic bacteria (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis (bacteroides forsythus), campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola) using the polymerase chain reaction method. clinical parameters including simplified oral hygiene index and papillary-marginal-attachment index were recorded for the children and their accompanied parents. results: the detection frequencies of t.  forsythensis, c. rectus, p. nigrescens, t. denticola, a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis in the oral cavities of children were 42.9%, 94.6%, 42.9%, 48.2%, 1.8% and 8.9%, respectively. t. forsythensis, p. gingivalis and t. denticola were detected more frequently in the saliva of parents (54.8%, 54.8%, 88.1%, respectively) than in the saliva of children (25.5%, 7.3%, 41.8%, respectively). different detection frequencies of p. nigrescens were found among  the oral cavities of children with deciduous, mixed and permanent dentitions. in  mixed dentition, females harbored t. forsythensis more frequently than males did. children who harbored t. forsythensis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens and t. denticola showed high scores for oral debris measurement by simplified oral hygiene index. t. forsythensis, p. intermedia and p. nigrescens were detected more frequently in children whose parents were positive for these pathogens than  in children whose parents were negative. conclusions: high plaque retention seems to promote the colonization of periodontal pathogens in the oral cavities of children. t. forsythensis, p. intermedia and p. nigrescens were detected more frequently in the oral cavities of children whose parents already harbored these  bacteria. familial transmission of these bacteria is suggested.

TI  == subgingival microbiota of chronic periodontitis subjects from different geographic locations.
AB  == background: most clinical studies assume that the subgingival microbiota is similar from one geographic location to another. the purpose of the present investigation was to examine the composition of the subgingival microbiota in chronic periodontitis subjects from four countries. method: subjects with chronic periodontitis (n, sweden=101; usa=115; brazil=58; chile=26) were recruited. subjects were measured at baseline for plaque, gingivitis, bleeding on probing (bop), suppuration, pocket depth (pd) and attachment level (al) at six sites per  tooth. subgingival plaque samples taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth at baseline were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (total samples=6036). % dna probe counts comprised by each species was determined for each site and averaged across sites  in each subject. significance of differences in proportions of each species among countries was determined using ancova adjusting for age, mean pocket depth, gender and smoking status. p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: on average, all species were detected in samples from subjects in the four countries. thirteen species differed significantly in adjusted mean proportions among countries even after adjusting for multiple comparisons. porphyromonas gingivalis, one species that differed in proportions among countries, comprised adjusted means of 7.5, 11.9, 1.6 and 6.6% of the microbiota  in subjects from brazil, chile, sweden and usa (p<0.001), while mean proportions  of treponema denticola were 6.7, 4.2, 0.8 and 2.3, respectively (p<0.001). in contrast, a key periodontal pathogen, tannerella forsythensis, exhibited mean proportions ranging from 6.2-8.5% and did not differ significantly among countries. besides these species, prominent species in brazil were actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1 and 2 (8.4%, 7.2%) and prevotella intermedia (6.5%); in  chile, prevotella melaninogenica (6.4%) and neisseria mucosa (5.3%); in sweden a. naeslundii genospecies 2 (8.4%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (7.1%) and peptostreptococcus micros (5.0%); in usa a. naeslundii genospecies 2 (7.5%), p. intermedia (6.8%) and c. gingivalis (6.1%). conclusions: the microbial profiles of subgingival plaque samples from chronic periodontitis subjects in four countries showed surprisingly marked differences. these differences persisted after adjusting for age, mean pocket depth, gender and smoking status.

TI  == clinical and microbiological effects of topical subgingival application of hyaluronic acid gel adjunctive to scaling and root planing in the treatment of chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: hyaluronic acid (ha) has shown anti-inflammatory effects in gingivitis therapy. the potential benefits of local subgingival application of ha adjunctive to scaling and root planing (srp) were evaluated in this study. methods: twenty patients with chronic periodontitis were included in this split-mouth study. sulcus fluid flow rate (sffr) and sulcus bleeding index were monitored at baseline and after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 12 weeks; probing depth and clinical attachment level were monitored at baseline and 6 and 12 weeks. subgingival plaque samples were also taken at these same three appointments to determine the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis, and treponema denticola. all patients were treated with full-mouth scaling and root planing (srp); in addition, an ha gel was administered subgingivally in the test sites every week for 6 weeks. results: an improvement of all clinical variables was observed (p < 0.05) in both groups. clinically, no difference between test and control sites could be found. no difference between test and control sites was seen in the tested microorganisms. conclusions: no clinical or microbiological improvement was achieved by the adjunctive use of ha gel compared to srp alone. only sffr was affected by the use of ha in terms of a more rapid reduction of sffr in the test sites.

TI  == contribution of periodontal pathogens on tongue dorsa analyzed with real-time pcr to oral malodor.
AB  == oral malodor is considered to originate primarily from tongue microbiota populations. however, the relationship between oral malodor and tongue microbiota remains unclear. in this study, tongue periodontal pathogens were analyzed via real-time pcr, and the association between oral malodor and tongue periodontal pathogens, including porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola, was examined. the subject population consisted of 29 individuals with and 10 healthy persons without oral malodor. oral malodor was assessed by organoleptic test and volatile sulfur compound (vsc) levels as measured by gas chromatography. real-time pcr was conducted for anaerobes in tongue biofilm samples employing a lightcycler system; furthermore, bacterial proportion served as a quantitative parameter. among the five anaerobes, only t. forsythia displayed higher proportions in malodor subjects than corresponding values in healthy controls. proportions of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens correlated strongly with hydrogen sulfide concentration. proportions of p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens also exhibited strong correlation with methyl mercaptan concentration. the correlation coefficient between the proportion of the total of the five anaerobes and total vsc level (r = 0.88) was greater than that between bacterial proportion and organoleptic score (r = 0.29). when a linear regression analysis was performed utilizing the proportion of each of the five periodontal pathogens as an independent variable, the explanatory power of these independent variables revealed 81% for total vsc level and 16% for organoleptic score. these results suggest that these five periodontal pathogens on tongue dorsa may contribute greatly to vsc production.

TI  == selected endodontic pathogens in the apical third of infected root canals: a molecular investigation.
AB  == bacteria located at the apical portion of the root canals are conceivably in a strategic position to induce damage to the periradicular tissues and resulting inflammatory diseases. this study sought to investigate the prevalence of 11 selected putative endodontic pathogens in the apical third of infected root canals associated with periradicular lesions. the apical root portion of 23 extracted teeth with carious pulpal exposures and attached periradicular lesions  was sectioned, and the root canals were sampled for microbiological investigation. dna was extracted from the samples and analyzed for the presence of 11 bacterial species using a nested polymerase chain reaction assay. the results showed that pseuramibacter alactolyticus occurred in 10 cases (44%), treponema denticola in 6 (26%), fusobacterium nucleatum in 6 (26%), porphyromonas endodontalis in 4 (17%), filifactor alocis in 2 (9%), dialister pneumosintes in 1 (4%), porphyromonas gingivalis in 1 (4%), and tannerella forsythensis in 1 (4%).  no sample yielded prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, or campylobacter  rectus. of the samples examined, 17 were positive for at least 1 of the target species. occurrence of these bacterial species in the apical third of infected root canals suggests that they can be involved in causation of periradicular lesions.

TI  == microbiological shifts in intra- and extraoral habitats following mechanical periodontal therapy.
AB  == objectives: the aim of the present study was to analyze the intra- and extraoral  colonization dynamics of periodontal pathogens following supra- and subgingival debridement. material and methods: thirty five patients with chronic periodontitis were enrolled in the study. supra- and subgingival plaque samples,  saliva, and swab samples from mucosa and extraoral sites were taken at baseline and 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after mechanical periodontal therapy. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), eikenella corrodens (ec), tannerella forsythensis (tf), prevotella intermedia (pi), prevotella nigrescens (pn), and treponema denticola (td) were identified by pcr. results: supra- and subgingival debridement decreased the number of subgingival sites infected with the analyzed pathogens only transiently, if at all. however, the detection frequencies of tf, td, ec, pi, and pn in the supragingival region, of pg, td, and pn at the oral mucosa sites (mostly the tongue), and of all pathogens except aa in saliva increased over the 6-month observation period. td was the only pathogen recorded in notable quantities in the extraoral habitat (external ear canal). conclusion: the results indicate that supra- and subgingival debridement results in a dissemination of periodontal pathogens within the oral cavity.

TI  == implant therapy following liver transplantation: clinical and microbiological results after 10 years.
AB  == background: the number of immunocompromised patients is increasing as a consequence of successful organ transplantation. placing dental implants in these patients has been questioned because of their increased risk for infections. the  10-year follow-up data of a 71-year-old liver transplant recipient with long-term immunosuppressive therapy is reported. six months after liver transplantation, two interforaminal implants were inserted in the edentulous mandible, and an overdenture using non-rigid telescopic attachments was fabricated 3 months later. methods: oral clinical parameters included the modified plaque index, sulcus fluid flow rate, modified bleeding index, probing depth, distance implant mucosa, attachment level, width of the keratinized mucosa and mobility values. the distance implant bone (dib) was determined on digital panoramic radiographs. the  levels of eight periodontal marker organisms were established using dna probe technology. additionally, swabs of the edentulous oral mucosa were taken for microbiological culture and antimicrobial resistance testing. results: the peri-implant parameters were within normal ranges indicating a stable osseointegration with moderate vertical bone loss. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis, campylobacter rectus, and treponema denticola were not detected. low levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and eikenella corrodens were found. prevotella intermedia was the only bacterium with a level higher than 10(4). the mucosal swabs indicated the presence of an abundant normal oral flora, including escherichia coli and candida albicans. the antibiogram revealed multiple resistance to antibiotics. conclusion: this case report suggests that immunocompromised patients can be successfully rehabilitated with dental implants.

TI  == genetic analysis of treponema denticola atcc 35405 biofilm formation.
AB  == treponema denticola is a major aetiological organism implicated in periodontal disease. the interaction of t. denticola with other oral bacteria, in particular  porphyromonas gingivalis, in biofilm formation is thought to be an important step in the onset of periodontal disease. the interaction between t. denticola and p.  gingivalis has been examined using a panel of t. denticola mutants and their effects on mixed biofilm formation tested in a static biofilm model. t. denticola atcc 35405 did not form detectable biofilms on various inert surfaces. however, the spirochaete was demonstrated to form a biofilm with preattached p. gingivalis 381. t. denticola cfpa, which lacks the cytoplasmic filament, was unable to produce a mixed biofilm with p. gingivalis. a t. denticola flge mutant which lacks the flagella hook protein and is therefore non-motile displayed a reduced,  but readily detectable, ability to form a mixed biofilm as did the t. denticola mutant which does not possess the major outer sheath protein (msp). the t. denticola lrra mutant was only moderately defective in forming mixed biofilms with p. gingivalis. however, the t. denticola methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein (dmca) did not appear to play a major role in mixed biofilm formation. in contrast, t. denticola lacking the prtp protein for prolyl-phenylalanine-specific protease, showed an increased ability to form mixed biofilms and a prolonged viability in the biofilm.

TI  == subgingival microbiota of chilean patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: an association between race/ethnicity and the composition of the subgingival microbiota has been found in chronic periodontitis. a study was undertaken to determine the characteristics of the subgingival microbiota of chronic periodontitis in chileans residing in santiago. methods: twenty-six subjects (mean age 45 +/- 7 years) with chronic periodontitis, mean probing depth (pd) 2.63 +/- 0.5 mm, mean attachment level (al) 3.70 +/- 0.77 mm, and without a  history of periodontal therapy were selected. measurements of pd, al, bleeding on probing, and plaque accumulation were recorded at six sites per tooth. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of every tooth and evaluated for the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the microbial data of the chileans were compared with data from 115 chronic periodontitis patients from boston, massachusetts. since several clinical and demographic parameters differed between the two populations, significance of differences for  each species was determined using analysis of covariance, adjusting for age, plaque level, mean pd, gender, and smoking status. results: each of the individual test species was present in at least 25 of the 26 subjects, and 12 subjects (46.1%) harbored all 40 test species. with the exception of prevotella intermedia, all test species colonized more than 75% of sites, and 25 species colonized > or = 90% of sites including the co-colonizing species of advanced periodontal lesions, termed the red complex, composed of the three species porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis (formerly bacteroides forsythus), and treponema denticola as well as fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, campylobacter rectus, peptostreptococcus micros, and treponerma socranskii. sixteen of the 40 species differed significantly between chilean and  u.s. subjects. red, yellow, and other complexes were significantly higher in the  chileans, while the actinomyces were higher in the u.s. subjects. conclusions: the composition of the subgingival plaque differs among different subject populations. thus, care should be taken when extrapolating the findings of one study to different ethnic groups.

TI  == changes in oral microbial profiles after periodontal treatment as determined by molecular analysis of 16s rrna genes.
AB  == terminal rflp (t-rflp) analysis was used to investigate changes in the oral microbiota in saliva and subgingival plaque samples from one patient with aggressive periodontitis (subject a) and two patients with chronic periodontitis  (subjects b and c) before and 3 months after periodontal treatment. substantial changes in the t-rflp patterns of subgingival plaque samples of subjects b and c  were noted after 3 months of improved oral hygiene and full-mouth supra- and subgingival scaling and root planing. however, there was little change in the subgingival microbiota of subject a. although the proportions of terminal restriction fragments (t-rfs) larger than 1000 bp were notable in the t-rflp patterns generated after digestion with hhai of the samples from two subjects before treatment (subject b, 35.5 %; subject c, 29.6 %), the proportions of these t-rfs were significantly reduced or not detected after treatment (subject b, none; subject c, 4.1 %). real-time pcr showed a significant change in the proportions of target bacteria in subgingival plaque samples of subject b. after  3 months, the porphyromonas gingivalis population was markedly reduced (3.1 x 10(-3) %), whereas the proportion of porphyromonas gingivalis before treatment was 7.6 %. the proportions of tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola and treponema socranskii were also markedly diminished after treatment. similarly, the proportion of the t-rf presumed to represent porphyromonas gingivalis was 5.9 % and became undetectable after 3 months. analysis of 16s rrna gene clone libraries from subgingival plaque samples of subject b before and after treatment showed a notable change in the subgingival microbiota. these results were in agreement with the t-rflp analysis data and showed that the t-rfs larger than 1000 bp represent peptostreptococcus species. our results indicate that t-rflp analysis is useful for evaluation of the effects of medical treatment of periodontitis.

AB  == quantitative analysis, with identification of periodontopathic bacteria, is important for the diagnosis, therapeutic evaluation and risk assessment of periodontal disease. we developed a highly sensitive and specific method using real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to detect and quantify six periodontal  bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens. species-specific taqman probe/primer sets were designed according to  16s ribosomal rna gene sequences. plaque and tongue debris specimens were collected from 10 patients with advanced periodontitis and 10 periodontal healthy individuals and analyzed. all species, except for p. nigrescens, were detected in samples from diseased sites in significantly greater numbers than in those from healthy sites, whereas greater numbers of p. nigrescens were found in the controls. these results suggest that the present real-time pcr method with the designed probe/primer sets enabled sensitive detection of the six periodontal bacteria, and may also assist future microbial studies of periodontal diseases.

TI  == quadrant root planing versus same-day full-mouth root planing. ii. microbiological findings.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that over a period of 6 months, same-day full-mouth scaling and root planing (fm-srp) resulted in greater reductions in the detection frequency of five putative periodontal pathogens compared with quadrant scaling and root planing (q-srp) in chronic periodontitis patients. materials and methods: forty patients were recruited into this study. subjects were randomised into two groups. the fm-srp group received full-mouth scaling and root planing completed within the same day, while the q-srp group received quadrant root planing at 2-weekly intervals over four consecutive sessions. selected-site analyses were performed on the deepest site in each quadrant before and after therapy, at approximately 3 and 6 months from baseline (r1 and r2) and clinical indices were recorded with an electronic pressure-sensitive probe. in addition, subgingival plaque samples were collected  from these sites at baseline (bas), at reassessment 1 (r1), approximately 6 weeks after the completion of therapy and at reassessment 2 (r2), 6 months from baseline. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used to determine the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in plaque. results: both therapies resulted in significant improvements in all clinical indices both  at r1 and r2. a marked reduction in the presence of all candidate periodontal pathogens was noted after both treatment modalities, reaching statistical significance for the majority of the test organisms. these improvements were maintained over a period of 6 months. when the two treatment groups were compared, a significantly higher percentage of q-srp patients was positive for p. intermedia at r1 compared with fm-srp patients (p<0.05). in addition, a greater reduction in the patient prevalence for t. denticola was found for the fm-srp group than the q-srp group at r1 and r2 from baseline (p<0.005), but the significance of this is questionable given the skewed detection frequency of this organism at baseline between the two treatments (p<0.01). conclusion: this study  failed to confirm that same-day fm-srp resulted in greater microbiological improvements compared with q-srp at 2-weekly intervals over a 6-month period, as  determined by pcr.

TI  == quadrant root planing versus same-day full-mouth root planing.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to determine whether same-day full-mouth scaling and root planing (fm-srp) and quadrant scaling and root planing (q-srp) resulted in variations in the systemic humoral immune response dynamics (antibody titres and avidity) during active treatment and 3 and 6 months post-therapy. materials and methods: forty patients with chronic periodontitis were recruited into this study. subjects were randomised into two groups and received either scaling and root planing quadrant by quadrant at 2-weekly intervals (q-srp group) or same-day full-mouth scaling and root planing (fm-srp group). clinical measurements and serum samples were obtained at baseline and approximately 6 weeks after the last clinical intervention (r1) and 6 months after the initiation of therapy (r2). furthermore, serum samples were obtained from each patient undergoing therapy (q-srp and fm-srp) at 3 bi-weekly instances so as to determine the short-term effects of each session of scaling and root planing on the dynamics of the humoral immune response. serum antibody titre was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) and antibody avidity was measured by thiocyanate dissociation against five putative periodontal pathogens: porphyromonas gingivalis; actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; prevotella intermedia; treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus. results: both therapies resulted in similar antibody titre reductions against the majority of the organisms tested and although there was a distinct trend for antibody avidity to increase following therapy, this was not found to be statistically significant, reflecting marked inter-individual variation. in addition, no evidence emerged from this study to support increased antibody titres following the active phases of both treatment approaches due to an inoculation effect. nevertheless, significant short-term increases in antibody avidity to most test bacteria were noted for both treatment strategies. conclusion: both therapies were associated with a reduction in antibody titres and an increase in the binding ability or avidity of antibodies, but there was a marked inter-subject variability and statistical significance was reached for only some of the test bacteria. no significant differences in the humoral antibody dynamics were found  between the two treatment approaches.

TI  == effects of a mixed infection with porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola on abscess formation and immune responses in mice.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola have been found together in lesions of human periodontitis. we examined the ability of a mixed infection by both bacteria to synergistically form abscesses and disturb immune responses in mice. absorbance of an invasive p. gingivalis 16-1 strain grown in tryptic soy broth and t. denticola atcc 33520 strain grown in tygvs medium were adjusted. balb/c mice were injected with 200 microliters of the cell suspension at a site on the lateral dorsal area. the sizes of the subsequent subcutaneous abscesses were measured with a caliper gauge, and the area was expressed in square mm. mixed infections by p. gingivalis and t.denticola produced larger abscesses than  those formed after mono-infections by either p. gingivalis or t.denticola. the abscesses caused by mixed infection reached their maxima on the 6th day and maintained that size for the subsequent 5 days. the delayed type hypersensitivities against extracted antigens of p.gingivalis in mixed infection  mice were significantly lower than those in the mono-infected mice. however, the  igg response to sonicated antigen of p.gingivalis did not differ between the two  groups. the sizes of the abscesses caused by mixed infections in mice immunized with whole cells of p.gingivalis 16-1 were compared to those caused in sham-immunized mice. the average size of the abscess caused by mixed infection in immunized mice did not differ from that in sham-immunized mice, but many of the abscesses in immunized mice ruptured on the 4th or 5th day, followed by recovery  in two weeks. these results suggest that mixed infection with p.gingivalis and t.denticola attenuates protective immune responses.

TI  == mixed infections with porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola cause excessive inflammatory responses in a mouse pneumonia model compared with monoinfections.
AB  == periodontopathic anaerobes such as porphyromonas gingivalis are frequently found  in aspiration pneumonia and lung abscesses. however, defense mechanisms and responses to these bacterial infections in the lung in vivo remain poorly understood. the coexistence of p. gingivalis with treponema denticola has been found at higher levels and proportions in periodontally diseased sites. we hypothesized that mixed infections with p. gingivalis and t. denticola can cause  severe respiratory disease. in the present study, inflammatory responses to mono- and mixed inoculations with p. gingivalis and t. denticola in the bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) fluid were investigated. acute pneumonia and lung abscesses in mice  with the mixed infection resulted in a 40% mortality rate within 72 h, compared with only 10% mortality for the respective monoinfections. pulmonary clearance of p. gingivalis was delayed in the mice with mixed infections with p. gingivalis and t. denticola. tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnfalpha) interleukin-1beta (il-1beta) and interleukin-6 (il-6) levels from bal fluid of mice with mixed infections at 24 h after inoculation were significantly higher than those after p. gingivalis monoinfection (tnfalpha: p < 0.05, il-1beta: p < 0.001, il-6: p < 0.05). the chemokine kc level from bal fluid of mice at 48 h (p < 0.05) and 72 h  after mixed infection was also significantly increased when compared with that after p. gingivalis monoinfection (p < 0.001). the present study demonstrates that a mixed infection of p. gingivalis with t. denticola in mouse causes a marked bronchopneumonia and lung abscess in the mouse model.

AB  == background: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is considered a major etiologic  agent of aggressive periodontitis. other periodontopathic bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis are also suspected of participating in aggressive periodontitis, although the evidence is controversial. the aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria and to clarify the microbiological features of aggressive periodontitis in japanese patients. methods: subgingival plaque was collected from 50 aggressive periodontitis (agp) patients (localized 10, generalized 40). samples from 35 generalized chronic periodontitis (cp) patients and 18 healthy subjects were examined as controls. plaque samples were examined using culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. results: the prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans  was relatively low in the localized (20%) and generalized (17.5%) agp patients, with no significant difference observed in detection frequencies between agp and  the control groups (cp 8.6%, healthy 0%). on the other hand, tannerella forsythensis (formerly bacteroides forsythus), campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, and treponema denticola were frequently detected in localized as well as generalized aggressive periodontitis patients. the prevalence and proportion of p. gingivalis correlated with severity of clinical attachment loss in both localized and generalized aggressive periodontitis. conclusions: t. forsythensis, c. rectus, p. gingivalis, and t. denticola were the predominant periodontopathic  bacteria of aggressive periodontitis patients in japan. although a. actinomycetem- comitans was also detected in agp patients, the prevalence of this bacterium was much lower than that of p. gingivalis.

TI  == the effects of extracts from periodontopathic bacteria on human periodontal fibroblasts stimulated with mineralization supplements.
AB  == bacterial effects on in vitro mineralization of human periodontal fibroblasts (hpf) have not yet been examined in great detail. in our study, we investigated the effects of soluble extracts of the periodontopathic bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus and, treponema denticola on cell proliferation, mineralization, as well as on osteoblastic markers present in hpf cultured in vitro, such as alkaline phosphatase (alp) activity and collagen content. periodontal fibroblasts stimulated by b-glycerophosphate, ascorbic acid and dexamethasone (bad) or by dexamethasone and ascorbic acid (da) were compared to unstimulated cells. during the cultivation period, the stimulation of hpf by combined dexamethasone and ascorbic acid (da) had a strong inductive effect on proliferation, alp activity and collagen formation. the extracts obtained from the periodontal pathogens had a suppressing effect on the proliferation rate of hpf. the extracts from p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and t. denticola caused a decrease in alp activity within 24 h of application. while extracts obtained from p. gingivalis and b. forsythus induced a reduction in collagen content in bad- and da-stimulated hpf cells, t. denticola extracts led to an increase in collagen. our data suggest that specific periodontopathic bacteria may suppress tissue regeneration in vivo not only by activating host defense mechanisms but also directly via a suppression of growth and differentiation of hpf and a reduction in the extracellular collagen matrix. for the process of pocket formation, not even the direct influence of viable bacteria seems to be necessary. additionally, long-distance effects of bacteria harboured in periodontal pockets or in root canals may be of importance.

TI  == clinical and microbiological evaluation of the periodontal status of children with unilateral complete cleft lip and palate.
AB  == objective: to compare periodontal conditions in children with and without cleft.  design: clinical examinations and microbiological analysis of 57 selected children, including 30 with unilateral complete cleft lip and palate (experimental group) and 27 without clefts (control group). setting: hospital of  rehabilitation of craniofacial anomalies (hrca) in bauru, sao paulo, brazil. patients, participants: all children examined were healthy and between the ages of 5 and 6 years. results: the mean plaque index (pi) in the experimental group was higher (1.82 +/- 0.3) than in the control group (1.63 +/- 0.38), although this difference was not statistically significant. the mean gingival index (gi) in the experimental group (1.82 +/- 0.38) was found to be significantly higher (p <.05) than that of the control group (0.79 +/- 0.33). the cleft area in the experimental group, with a mean pi of 2.04 +/- 0.58 and mean gi of 1.11 +/- 0.26, compared with the posterior area, with a mean pi of 1.74 +/- 0.37 and mean gi of  1.04 +/- 0.26, showed a statistically significant difference only in the pi. most of the children in both experimental and control groups presented a moderate pi degree (73.33% and 81.48%, respectively) and a high prevalence of mild gingivitis (53.33% and 70.37%, respectively). analysis of the organisms showed that prevotella nigrescens was detected in 16.67% of the experimental group and 11.11% of the control, whereas porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola were not detected. conclusion: children with clefts showed greater gingival inflammation,  despite the same amount of plaque and prevalence of microorganisms.

TI  == binding of porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae to treponema denticola dentilisin.
AB  == treponema denticola has been reported to coaggregate with porphyromonas gingivalis and localize closely together in matured subgingival plaque. in this study of the interaction of t. denticola with p. gingivalis, the p. gingivalis fimbria-binding protein of t. denticola was identified by two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by a ligand overlay assay with p. gingivalis fimbriae, and was determined to be dentilisin, a chymotrypsin-like proteinase of t. denticola. the binding was further demonstrated with a ligand overlay assay using an isolated gst fusion dentilisin construct. our results suggest that p. gingivalis fimbriae and t. denticola dentilisin are implicated in the coaggregation of these bacteria.

TI  == positive and negative bacterial associations involving dialister pneumosintes in  primary endodontic infections.
AB  == dialister pneumosintes is an anaerobic gram-negative rod that has been recently implicated as a candidate endodontic pathogen. in this study, samples taken from  abscessed teeth and infected root canals associated with asymptomatic or symptomatic periradicular lesions were examined for the occurrence of bacterial associations involving d. pneumosintes. dna was extracted from the samples, and the presence of d. pneumosintes and 16 other bacterial species was determined by  means of species-specific nested polymerase chain reaction. positive and negative associations involving d. pneumosintes were investigated by computing the odds ratio of d. pneumosintes being found in a sample from endodontic infection in co-infection with one of the other target species. the association between the pairs containing d. pneumosintes and the occurrence of pain also was evaluated. d. pneumosintes was always detected in mixed infections with at least two of the  other target species. d. pneumosintes was positively associated with treponema denticola, porphyromonas endodontalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, t. pectinovorum, and t. vincentii. negative associations were observed with bacteroides forsythus, p. gingivalis, and actinomyces israelii. no pair containing d. pneumosintes was found to be significantly associated with symptomatic cases (p > 0.01). the findings of this study lend considerable support to the notion of d. pneumosintes being an important endodontic pathogen,  usually in a mixed infection. positive associations of this species with other highly prevalent species, such as t. denticola and p. endodontalis, suggest that  bacterial synergism can occur and thereby play an important role in the pathogenesis of different forms of periradicular lesions.

TI  == the benzoyl-dl arginine-naphthylamide (bana) test and polymerase chain reaction measurement of pathogenic bacteria can assess the severity of periodontal disease.
AB  == the benzoyl-dl arginine-naphthylamide (bana) test for detecting digesting peptidase and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) measurement of pathogenic bacteria  were performed in 15 patients with periodontal disease. the number of porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus and treponema denticola, which are the most potent accelerators of alveolar bone resorption, were determined. attachment loss and the bana test showed significant close correlations with the  number of pathogenic bacteria as well as with the tooth mobility and pocket depth. in conclusion, the bana test and pcr measurement of bacteria are useful methods for detecting pathogenic bacteria that promote alveolar tissue destruction.

TI  == pcr methodology as a valuable tool for identification of endodontic pathogens.
AB  == objectives: this paper reviews the principles of polymerase chain reaction (pcr)  methodology, its application in identification of endodontic pathogens and the perspectives regarding the knowledge to be reached with the use of this highly sensitive, specific and accurate methodology as a microbial identification test.  data sources: studies published in the medical, dental and biological literature. study selection: evaluation of published epidemiological studies examining the endodontic microbiota through pcr methodology. conclusions: pcr technology has enabled the detection of bacterial species that are difficult or even impossible  to culture as well as cultivable bacterial strains showing a phenotypically divergent or convergent behaviour. moreover, pcr is more rapid, much more sensitive, and more accurate when compared with culture. its use in endodontics to investigate the microbiota associated with infected root canals has expanded the knowledge on the bacteria involved in the pathogenesis of periradicular diseases. for instance, tannerella forsythensis (formerly bacteroides forsythus), treponema denticola, other treponema species, dialister pneumosintes, and prevotella tannerae were detected in infected root canals for the first time and  in high prevalence when using pcr analysis. the diversity of endodontic microbiota has been demonstrated by studies using pcr amplification, cloning and  sequencing of the pcr products. moreover, other fastidious bacterial species, such as porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis and some eubacterium spp., have been reported in endodontic infections at a higher prevalence than those reported by culture procedures.

TI  == five-year maintenance follow-up of early-onset periodontitis patients.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological status of patients with early-onset or aggressive periodontitis (eop) who had received supportive periodontal care (spc) every 3-6 months for a period of 5 years, following active periodontal treatment. material and methods:  the study population consisted of 25 individuals with early-onset periodontitis.  clinical examination and recordings of probing pocket depth (ppd) and clinical attachment level (cal) were performed at baseline prior to treatment (t0), 3 months following the termination of active periodontal treatment (t1) and annually at the spc appointments (t2,t3,t4,t5). microbiological samples were obtained at the 5-year spc (t5). subgingival plaque samples for each individual were collected from one deep pocket (>5 mm), based on pretreatment measurements,  randomly selected in each quadrant. the levels of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola were determined using oligonucleotide probe hybridization. results: during the 5-year period, the mean of spc/patient was 12.7 sessions. a significant improvement was observed in ppd, cal, gingival bleeding index and suppuration following treatment. however, between t1 and t5, 134 sites in 20 patients deteriorated with a cal loss of> or =2 mm. out of these 134 sites showing disease progression, microbial samples were randomly obtained in 13 sites (9.7%) from 8 patients. among other factors, smoking and stress were found to have significant predictive value on the future attachment loss. p. gingivalis, t. denticola and total bacterial load were statistically significantly higher in  patients who experienced disease progression during the 5-year maintenance period. conclusions: for most eop patients, regular spc was effective in maintaining clinical and microbiological improvements attained after active periodontal therapy. however, a small percentage of sites was identified as progressive in 20 patients. variables found to be related to periodontal progression were the presence of as well as the high bacterial counts of p. gingivalis, t. denticola and total bacterial load, number of acute episodes, number of teeth lost, smoking and stress.

TI  == subgingival microbiota levels and their associations with periodontal status at the sampled sites in an adult sudanese population using miswak or toothbrush regularly.
AB  == little information is available on the effect of miswak use on gingival microbiota. we assessed levels of 28 oral bacteria in subgingival plaque of adult sudanese miswak (n = 38) and toothbrush users (n = 36) age range 20-53 years (mean 34.6 years) to study associations between these bacteria, oral hygiene method, and periodontal status at the sampled sites. a pooled subgingival plaque  sample from 6 probing sites of 1 selected tooth in each jaw was obtained from each subject. whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization were used in assessing 74 pooled samples. using 10(5) bacterial cells threshold,  between 2.6% and 47.4% of miswak users and between 2.8% and 36.1% of toothbrush users harbored the investigated species. the percentages of subjects with the investigated species at 10(6) bacterial cells varied between 2.6% and 39.5% in miswak and between 2.8% and 36.1% in toothbrush users. miswak users harbored significantly higher streptococcus intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, veillonella parvula, actinomyces israelii, and capnocytophaga gingivalis, and significantly lower selenomonas sputigena, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, and streptococcus oralis than did toothbrush users. probing pocket depth > or = 6 mm showed significantly (p <  0.05) higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and v. parvula than those 4-5 mm. our results indicate that the type of oral hygiene had a significant effect on levels of 11 out of 28 bacterial species, and that the type of effect was also dependent on type of bacteria and probing pocket depth.

TI  == enzymatic degradation of collagen-guided tissue regeneration membranes by periodontal bacteria.
AB  == bacterial infection in the vicinity of guided tissue regeneration barrier membranes was shown to have a negative effect on the clinical outcomes of this increasingly used technique. several oral and specifically periodontal bacteria were shown to adhere to such membranes in vivo and in vitro with a higher affinity to membranes constructed from collagen. the present study examined the role of periodontal bacteria and their enzymes in the degradation of commercially used collagen membranes. degradation of two collagen membranes [biomend (calcitek, colla-tec inc., plainsboro, nj) and bio-gide (geistlich biomaterials,  wolhousen, switzerland)] labeled by fluorescein isothiocyanate was examined by measuring soluble fluorescence. porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and their enzymes were evaluated. collagenase from clostridium hystolyticum was used as a positive control. while whole cells of p. gingivalis were able to degrade both types of membranes, t. denticola could degrade bio-gide membranes only and a. actinomycetemcomitans whole cells could degrade none of the membranes. fractionation of p. gingivalis cells revealed that cell membrane associated proteases were responsible for the degradation of the two collagen membranes. in t. denticola, the purified major phenylalanine protease was found to be responsible for the degradation of bio-gide membranes. these results suggest that proteolytic bacterial enzymes may  take part in the degradation of collagen barrier membranes used for guided tissue regeneration.

TI  == periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque of hiv-positive subjects with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == many putative periodontal pathogens associated with periodontal disease in human  immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-infected patients also occur in non-hiv-infected individuals. this study examined the prevalence of eight periodontal pathogens in hiv-positive and hiv-negative patients with chronic periodontitis using the 16s rna polymerase chain reaction technique. the results showed a significant prevalence of porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola among hiv-negative patients compared to hiv-positive patients. sixty percent of the patients in both groups were colonized by five to six species. odds ratio analysis revealed a statistically significant positive association between three of the 28 possible combinations in the hiv-positive group. they included prevotella nigrescens/campylobacter rectus, p. nigrescens/p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens/t. denticola. although the prevalence of periodontal pathogens is similar in both the groups, the combination of certain periodontal pathogens may be responsible for chronic periodontitis seen in hiv-infected adults.

TI  == inhibitory effect of procyanidin oligomer from elm cortex on the matrix metalloproteinases and proteases of periodontopathogens.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of this study was to evaluate a partially purified extract (elm extract) from the ulmi cortex (ulmi macrocarpa hance) and its active ingredient, a mix of procyanidin oligomers (3 to 12 flavan-3-ol monomers, an average molecular weight of 1,518 with an average polymerization degree of 5.3) for a possible inhibitory effect against proteases. background: host-derived matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) and bacterial proteases play important roles in  the gingival tissue destruction that is a characteristic of periodontitis. the inhibitors of these proteases may be developed into therapeutic agents against periodontitis. methods: the inhibitory effects were assessed by gelatin zymography. the mmps tested were originated from the gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) of adult periodontitis patients and from the conditioned media of cultured  periodontal ligament (pdl) cells, which provided the prommp-2 and activated mmp-2 when treated with a periodontopathogen, treponema lecithinolyticum. bacterial enzymes tested were secreted forms from two major periodontopathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. in addition, the inhibitory effects on trypsin-like enzymes from these two periodontopathogens were assayed by the n-benzoyl-dl-arginine-naphthylamide (bana) test. results: the elm extract  and the procyanidin oligomer (100-1,000 microg/ml) exhibited potent inhibitory effects on the mmps in gcf (chiefly mmp-8 and mmp-9), the pro and active forms of mmp-2, and secreted and trypsin-like enzymes from t. denticola and p. gingivalis. conclusions: these results suggest that elm cortex should be considered as a potential agent against periodontal diseases, due to its inhibitory action on mmps and the proteases of periodontopathogens.

TI  == accidentally induced periodontitis in primary dentition: longitudinal examinations of periodontal bacteria and clinical conditions.
AB  == periodontitis is very rare in the primary dentition although it can be accidentally induced in young children. the purpose of this study was to describe a case of periodontitis in a 4-year-old child, which was accidentally induced by  insertion of small plastic tubes into the dental cervix of the primary incisors during play, and to discuss the clinical, radiographic, and microbiological findings. removal of the plastic tubes resulted in resolution of the periodontal  condition. prevotella nigrescens and campylobacter rectus were detected in subgingival plaque samples from the affected teeth at every examination, whereas  porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, and bacteroides forsythus were never found during the two-year observation period. the clinical and microbiological results suggest that the type of periodontitis caused by such an incidence is not progressive, unlike other periodontal diseases such as prepubertal and juvenile periodontitis.

TI  == genetic relatedness and phenotypic characteristics of treponema associated with human periodontal tissues and ruminant foot disease.
AB  == treponema have been implicated recently in the pathogenesis of digital dermatitis (dd) and contagious ovine digital dermatitis (codd) that are infectious diseases  of bovine and ovine foot tissues, respectively. previous analyses of treponemal 16s rdna sequences, pcr-amplified directly from dd or codd lesions, have suggested relatedness of animal treponema to some human oral treponema species isolated from periodontal tissues. in this study a range of adhesion and virulence-related properties of three animal treponema isolates have been compared with representative human oral strains of treponema denticola and treponema vincentii. in adhesion assays using biotinylated treponemal cells, t. denticola cells bound in consistently higher numbers to fibronectin, laminin, collagen type i, gelatin, keratin and lactoferrin than did t. vincentii or animal treponema isolates. however, animal dd strains adhered to fibrinogen at equivalent or greater levels than t. denticola. all treponema strains bound to the amino-terminal heparin i/fibrin i domain of fibronectin. 16s rdna sequence analyses placed ovine strain ub1090 and bovine strain ub1467 within a cluster that was phylogenetically related to t. vincentii, while ovine strain ub1466 appeared more closely related to t. denticola. these observations correlated with phenotypic properties. thus, t. denticola atcc 35405, gm-1, and treponema ub1466  had similar outer-membrane protein profiles, produced chymotrypsin-like protease  (ctlp), trypsin-like protease and high levels of proline iminopeptidase, and co-aggregated with human oral bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus crista. conversely, t. vincentii atcc 35580, d2a-2, and animal strains ub1090 and ub1467 did not express ctlp or trypsin-like protease and did not co-aggregate with p. gingivalis or s. crista. taken collectively, these results suggest that human oral-related treponema have broad host specificity and that similar control or preventive strategies might be developed for human and animal treponema-associated infections.

TI  == herpesviral-bacterial interactions in aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: human cytomegalovirus, epstein-barr virus and herpesvirus co-infections occur with significantly higher frequency in actively progressing than in stable periodontitis sites of adolescents and young adults. also, periodontal presence of cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr virus is associated with increased occurrence of subgingival porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, dialister pneumosintes, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens,  treponema denticola and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. aim: this article reviews the evidence linking herpesviruses to the development of aggressive periodontitis and suggests a potential mechanism for herpesviral acceleration of  the periodontal disease process. conclusions: it seems to be a reasonable supposition that the etiopathogenesis of various types of aggressive periodontitis includes the combined action of herpesviruses and specific bacterial species. new vaccines and vaccination technologies that are being developed against herpesviruses warrant testing for their ability to induce a protective immune response against destructive periodontal disease. clearly, the  importance of combined herpesviral-bacterial infections and associated host responses in the development of periodontitis needs to be studied further.

AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to investigate the presence of antigens with immunological cross-reactivity in periodontopathogenic bacteria and helicobacter  pylori, the pathogen associated with gastritis and peptic ulcers in human. materials and methods/results: among the putative periodontopathogens tested (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola), cross-reactive bands were only detected in c. rectus by sds-page/western immunoblotting analysis using a polyclonal antibody directed to  h. pylori cells. one of these cross-reactive antigens, a 64-kda band antigen, also reacted with a monoclonal antibody directed to the human heat shock protein  (hsp) 60. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of this c. rectus protein revealed a high degree of homology with corresponding regions of other hsps belonging to the hsp60 family, indicating that the 64-kda antigen was a groel protein. the nucleotide sequence of the c. rectus groel protein coded for a 547 amino acid protein with a predicted size of 57.8 kda. comparison of the alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence of the groel protein of c. rectus with that of h. pylori showed a high degree of similarity throughout its length (76.8%). groel protein from c. rectus possessed the ability to stimulate production of il-6 by a confluent monolayer of human gingival epithelial cells and was cytotoxic when used at a high concentration. conclusions: this study reveals an immunological relationship between h. pylori and c. rectus, and clearly indicates that one of the shared antigens is a groel protein possessing a biological activity that might play a role in the initiation and progression of periodontal disease.

TI  == periodontopathogens in the saliva and subgingival dental plaque of a group of mothers.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the periodontal condition and the presence of putative periodontal pathogens in 30 brazilian mothers, aging 21-40 years (28.4 4.49 years), and in their children, aging 5-6 years, since mothers can be a source of pathogens and, thus, influence their children's bacteriological and clinical condition. besides assessing the plaque index (pi), gingival index (gi)  and pocket probing depth (pd), the survey analyzed four subgingival dental plaque samples from mothers and children, as well as a sample of stimulated saliva from  mothers. those samples were analyzed by means of the slot immunoblot (sib) technique, in order to determine the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), prevotella nigrescens (pn), porphyromonas gingivalis  (pg) and treponema denticola (td). the mean values and standard deviations of the evaluated clinical variables for mothers and children were, respectively: 1.86 0.67 and 1.64 0.68 for pi, and 1.24 0.67 and 0.82 0.37, for gi. only for mothers, the total pd was 1.81 0.69 mm, and the pd of four sites was 4.03 1.40 mm. the wilcoxon test revealed significant difference (p < 0.05) between mothers and their children only as to gi. the most prevalent bacteria in mothers were, in decreasing order: aa, pn, pg and td. the children presented patterns of oral hygiene and bacterial profiles similar to those of their mothers, in spite of the fact that most of them did not present enough subgingival plaque for testing. the comparison between mothers' subgingival dental plaque and saliva samples revealed statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) for all bacteria, with greater positivity and scores in the saliva, which demonstrates that it is an indicator of oral colonization and can work as a vehicle for the transmission of periodontopathogens from mothers to their children.

TI  == role for recombinant gamma-glutamyltransferase from treponema denticola in glutathione metabolism.
AB  == volatile sulfur compounds, including hydrogen sulfide (h(2)s), have been implicated in the development of periodontal disease. glutathione is an important thiol source for h(2)s production in periodontal pockets. our recent studies have delineated a pathway of glutathione metabolism in treponema denticola that releases h(2)s. in this pathway, gamma-glutamyltransferase (ggt) has been proposed to catalyze the first step of glutathione degradation. we have cloned the gene of ggt from t. denticola, which contains an open reading frame of 726 bp encoding a protein of 241 amino acids. transformation of this gene into escherichia coli led to the expression of a recombinant protein. after purification by chromatography, the recombinant protein showed enzymatic activity typical of ggt, catalyzing the degradation of na-gamma-glutamyl-4-nitroaniline (gna) and the hydrolysis of glutathione, releasing glutamic acid or glutamine and cysteinylglycine. l-cysteine is not a substrate of ggt. importantly, gna, when added to t. denticola, was able to compete with glutathione and inhibit the production of h(2)s, ammonia, and pyruvate. this was accompanied by the suppression of hemoxidative and hemolytic activities of the bacteria. purified ggt was inactivated by tlck (nalpha-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone) and proteinase k treatment. however, higher enzymatic activity was demonstrated in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol. our further experiments showed that the addition of recombinant ggt to porphyromonas gingivalis, a bacterium without significant glutathione-metabolizing capacity, drastically increased the utilization of glutathione by the bacterium, producing h(2)s, ammonia, and pyruvate. this was again accompanied by enhanced bacterial hemoxidative and hemolytic activities. together, the results suggest an important role for ggt in glutathione metabolism in oral bacteria.

TI  == correlations between bacterial levels in autologous subgingival plaque and saliva of adult sudanese.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess levels of oral bacteria and their correlations in paired samples of saliva and subgingival plaque in a population of adult sudanese. whole saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples from six probing sites of one tooth in each jaw were obtained from 56 sudanese adults (mean age 35.2+/-8.9 years). levels of 24 oral bacteria in the autologous saliva  and pooled plaque sample of each subject were assessed by dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. there were significantly ( p< or =0.01) higher percentages of subjects with > or =10(5) bacterial cells of prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, veillonella parvula, streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus salivarius, and leptotrichia buccalis and significantly ( p< or =0.01) lower percentages with treponema denticola in saliva than in subgingival plaque. the detection frequencies at > or =10(6) bacterial cells were significantly higher for selenomonas sputigena, s. anginosus, streptococcus sanguis, and s. salivarius and significantly lower for porphyromonas gingivalis in saliva than in subgingival plaque ( p< or =0.01). porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, s. sputigena, s. sanguis, and streptococcus mitis demonstrated significant ( p< or =0.05) positive correlations between their levels in plaque and saliva. this study indicates that the levels of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, s.  sanguis, and s. mitis correlate significantly in saliva and subgingival plaque and that higher accuracy of detection and assessment of the levels of these bacteria in the oral cavity may be achieved by concurrent sampling of saliva and  subgingival plaque.

AB  == background: halitosis has been correlated with the concentration of volatile sulfur compounds (vsc) produced in the oral cavity by metabolic activity of bacteria colonizing the periodontal area and the dorsum of the tongue. the aim of this study was to determine whether there is some relationship between the presence of n-benzoyl-dl-arginine-2-napthylamide (bana)-positive species treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, and bacteroides forsythus and clinical and oral malodor parameters. methods: twenty-one subjects (21 to 59 years old) with probing depths (pd) > 3.0 mm and 20 subjects (21 to 63 years old) with pd < or = 3.0 mm (controls) participated. the quality of the mouth air was assessed organoleptically, and a portable sulfide monitor was used to measure the concentration of vsc. clinical parameters, plaque index (pi) and gingival index (gi), were obtained from 6 teeth. samples for bana test were taken from the dorsal surface of the tongue, saliva, and the 6 reference teeth. results: the scores of pi, gi, subgingival samples that tested positive for bana hydrolyzing species, organoleptic ratings, and vsc values were significantly higher in the subjects with pd > 3.0 mm (p < 0.01, mann-whitney u test). there was a correlation between bana hydrolysis by subgingival plaque bacteria and vsc values (r = 0.55, p < 0.01), and between gi and vsc values (r = 0.48, p < 0.05) in patients with pd > 3.0 mm. there was no significant correlation between these parameters in the control group. conclusion: these results confirm that the bana  hydrolyzing bacteria in the subgingival plaque are an important source of malodor production in the oral cavity.

TI  == comparison of 16s rdna-based pcr and checkerboard dna-dna hybridisation for detection of selected endodontic pathogens.
AB  == molecular methods have been used recently to investigate the bacteria encountered in human endodontic infections. the aim of the present study was to compare the ability of a 16s rdna-based pcr assay and checkerboard dna-dna hybridisation in detecting actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, peptostreptococcus micros, porphyromonas endodontalis, por. gingivalis and treponema denticola directly from clinical samples. specimens were obtained from  50 cases of endodontic infections and the presence of the target species was investigated by whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridisation or taxon-specific oligonucleotides with pcr assay. prevalence of the target species was based on data obtained by each method. the sensitivity and specificity of each molecular method was compared with the data generated by the  other method as the reference--a value of 1.0 representing total agreement with the chosen standard. the methods were also compared with regard to the prevalence values for each target species. regardless of the detection method used, t. denticola, por. gingivalis, por. endodontalis and b. forsythus were the most prevalent species. if the checkerboard data for these four species were used as the reference, pcr detection sensitivities ranged from 0.53 to 1.0, and specificities from 0.5 to 0.88, depending on the target bacterial species. when pcr data for the same species were used as the reference, the detection sensitivities for the checkerboard method ranged from 0.17 to 0.73, and specificities from 0.75 to 1.0. accuracy values ranged from 0.6 to 0.74. on the whole, matching results between the two molecular methods ranged from 60% to 97.5%, depending on the target species. the major discrepancies between the methods comprised a number of pcr-positive but checkerboard-negative results. significantly higher prevalence figures for por. endodontalis and t. denticola were observed after pcr assessment. there was no further significant difference between the methods with regard to detection of the other target species.

TI  == transmission of periodontal disease-associated bacteria from teeth to osseointegrated implant regions.
AB  == purpose: the presence of periodontopathic bacteria is a risk factor for peri-implantitis. the present study examined colonization by periodontopathic bacteria and their transmission from periodontal pockets to osseointegrated implant sulcus. materials and methods: plaque samples were collected from 105 sites in the 15 patients who participated in the study. colonization by these bacteria was examined by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and culture. the transmission of periodontopathic bacteria from periodontal sites of natural teeth to the implant sulcus was analyzed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge). results: the pcr detection rates of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, and treponema denticola were 80.0%, 53.3%, 46.7%, 60.0% and 40.0%, respectively. colonizations by p gingivalis and a actinomycetemcomitans were statistically correlated with periodontal pockets and implant sulcus regions (p < .01). the pfge patterns of the p gingivalis strains isolated from each patient were identical, but differed from those from other patients. the pfge patterns of p intermedia strains were identical in 2 out of 3 patients. discussion: these analyses indicated that there appeared to be transmission of p gingivalis and p intermedia from the periodontal pocket to the peri-implant region. conclusion: elimination of these periodontal pathogens from the patient's oral cavity before  administering dental implant treatment may inhibit colonization by these pathogens and reduce the risk of peri-implantitis.

TI  == comparison of microbial cultivation and a commercial pcr based method for detection of periodontopathogenic species in subgingival plaque samples.
AB  == objectives: microbiological laboratory procedures are involved in diagnosis and therapy control of progressive and refractory forms of periodontitis. in recent years techniques have been developed based on the detection of nucleic acids. the purpose of this study was to validate the commercially available micro-dent(r) test which employs probes for a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, b. forsythus and t. denticola. methods: 122 plaque samples obtained from periodontal pockets with various depths from 33 early onset periodontitis (eop) patients and 15 periodontally healthy subjects were analysed by cultivation and the microdent(r) kit. results: both cultivation and the nucleic acid based assay showed a positive correlation of pocket depth with the frequency and quantity of periodontopathogenic species. t. denticola was found only in pockets  > 4 mm in eop patients. comparison of the two methods revealed that the microdent(r) kit identified both p. gingivalis and b. forsythus more often than did the cultivation method. conclusions: nucleic acid techniques should replace cultivation methods as gold standard in microbiological diagnosis of progressive  periodontitis. the micro-dent(r) kit can be recommended for microbiological laboratories analysing subgingival plaque samples.

TI  == relationship of changes in interleukin-8 levels and granulocyte elastase activity in gingival crevicular fluid to subgingival periodontopathogens following non-surgical periodontal therapy in subjects with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == objectives: to determine the effect of scaling and root planing (srp) on the interrelations of subgingival periodontopathogens and both interleukin-8 (il-8) and granulocyte elastase activity in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf), and to assess their relations to the short-term treatment response in management of chronic periodontitis. material and methods: gcf and subgingival plaque were collected from 16 subjects with untreated chronic periodontitis at baseline and 4 weeks after srp. il-8 levels were determined by elisa. granulocyte elastase activity was analyzed with a specific substrate, pgluproval-pna, and the maximal  rate of elastase activity (mr-ea) was calculated. 5 dna-probes were used to detect the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans (a. a.), b. forsythus (b.f.), p.  gingivalis (p.g.), p. intermedia (p.i.), and t. denticola (t.d.), with a sensitivity = 103 cells/paper point. results: il-8 and mr-ea levels in gcf decreased significantly after srp (p < 0.001) with a corresponding reduction of total count of the species. of the sites with probing depth (pd) >/= 5.0 mm and co-infection by b.f., p.g., p.i. & t.d. at baseline, the sites without persistent co-infection of these species after srp exhibited a significant reduction of il-8 levels (p < 0.02), mr-ea levels (p < 0.02) and pd (p < 0.01). no such change was  found in the sites where such a co-infection persisted. moreover, reduction of il-8 levels in those pocket sites was accompanied by a concomitant reduction of mr-ea (p < 0.02) and pd (p < 0.01), while no significant change in mr-ea levels and pd was noted in those pocket sites that exhibited an increase of il-8 levels  after srp. at baseline, the former group of sites showed significantly higher il-8 levels than the latter group of sites (p < 0.02). conclusions: il-8-related  granulocyte elastase activity was related to the change in infection patterns of  the target periodontopathogens following scaling and root planing. varying initial il-8 levels in gcf and a corresponding shifting change of granulocyte elastase activity in gcf may characterize the different short-term treatment responses.

TI  == clinical and microbiological analysis of periodontally diseased sites after renal transplant.
AB  == this study compared the clinical and microbiological status of periodontally diseased sites in 42 patients who had a renal transplant and were undergoing immunosuppressive therapy (21 taking azathioprin and corticosteroids [az-c] and 21 taking cyclosporin-a [cy-a] with those of 21 systemically healthy matched controls. probing pocket depth (ppd), bleeding on probing (bop) and gingival hyperplasia (gh) were measured at 339 sites. subgingival plaque samples were analyzed for the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and/or bacteroides forsythus using the bana test. our findings suggest that immunosuppressed patients showed significantly less inflammation and fewer putative anaerobic pathogens using the bana test, and that patients undergoing therapy with cyclosporin-a have a higher frequency of sites with gingival hyperplasia when compared with patients medicated with azathioprin or corticosteroids.

TI  == microbiological, immunological and genetic factors in family members with periodontitis as a manifestation of systemic disease, associated with hematological disorders.
AB  == the microflora, immunological profiles of host defence functions, and human leukocyte antigen (hla) findings are reported for a mother, son and daughter who  were diagnosed as having 'periodontitis as a manifestation of systemic diseases,  associated with hematological disorders'. examinations were made of the bacterial flora from the periodontal pocket, neutrophil chemotaxis, neutrophil phagocytosis, and the genotypes (dqb1) and serotypes (dr locus) of hla class ii antigens. phenotypic analyses of the peripheral lymphocytes were also conducted.  the subgingival microflora from the mother was dominated by gram-negative rods, especially porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum. subgingival microflora samples from the son and daughter were dominated by gram-positive cocci and gram-positive rods. through the use of polymerase chain reaction, campylobacter rectus and capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in all subjects, whereas porphyromonas gingivalis, p. intermedia, and treponema denticola were not detected in any subjects. all three subjects showed a remarkable level of depressed neutrophil chemotaxis to n-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, although their phagocyte function levels were normal, in comparison to healthy control subjects. each subject had the same genotype, hla-dqb1*0601, while the mother had hla-dr2 and hla-dr8, and the son and daughter had hla-dr2 only. in summary, the members of this family showed a similar predisposition to periodontitis with regard to certain host defence functions. it is suggested that the depressed neutrophil chemotaxis that was identified here could be a significant risk factor for periodontitis in this family.

TI  == microbiological findings and host response in patients with peri-implantitis.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to characterise microbiota and inflammatory host response around implants and teeth in patients with peri-implantitis. we included 17 partly edentulous patients with a total of 98 implants, of which 45 showed marginal bone loss of more than three fixture threads after the first year of loading. nineteen subjects with stable marginal tissue conditions served as controls. oral hygiene, gingival inflammation, and probing pocket depth were evaluated clinically at teeth and implants. microbiological and crevicular fluid  samples were collected from five categories of sites: 1) implants with peri-implantitis (pi), 2) stable implants (si) in patients with both stable and peri-implantitis implants, 3) control implants (ci) in patients with stable implants alone, 4) teeth in patients (tp) and 5) controls (tc). crevicular fluid  from teeth and implants was analysed for elastase activity, lactoferrin and il-1  beta concentrations. elastase activity was higher at pi than at ci in controls. lactoferrin concentration was higher at pi than at si in patients with peri-implantitis. higher levels of both lactoferrin and elastase activity were found at pi than at teeth in patients. the concentrations of il-1 beta were about the same in the various sites. microbiological dna-probe analysis revealed a putative periodontal microflora at teeth and implants in patients and controls. patients with peri-implantitis harboured high levels of periodontal pathogens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus and treponema denticola. these findings indicate a site-specific inflammation rather than a patient-associated specific host response.

TI  == clinical, genetic and microbiological findings in a brazilian family with aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background/aim: aggressive periodontitis comprises a group of rapidly progressive forms of periodontitis. besides bacteria, a high level of subject susceptibility  must be involved in the expression of disease. in the present study, we report the clinical, microbiological and genetic profile of a 14-individual family with  aggressive periodontitis. method: pcr was utilized to detect pathogenic bacteria  of affected sites. dna was obtained from epithelial cells through a mouthwash with 3% glucose and scrapping of the oral mucosa. rflp-pcr was used to analyze cytokine genetic polymorphisms. results: localized aggressive periodontitis was diagnosed for an 18-year-old systemically healthy non-smoking proband, with siblings displaying aggressive periodontitis. bacteroides forsythus and treponema denticola were the most frequent pathogens. the proband presented actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans and detectable levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus and treponema denticola. allele 2 of il-1alpha (-889) polymorphism was found in all individuals as well as allele 1 of the il-1beta (+3953) gene. alleles 1 and 2 (50 % each) of il-1beta (-511), allele 1 of tnf-alpha (-308) and allele 2 (in homo or heterozygosity) of il-rn (intron 2) gene were present. conclusion: the results show that the present microbiological  and genetic parameters were not relevant for the prediction of periodontitis susceptibility in this family.

TI  == clinical and microbiological studies of periodontal disease in sjogren syndrome patients.
AB  == background: little is known about the periodontal status of patients with sjogren's syndrome (ss), a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized  by xerophthalmia and xerostomia. the aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the periodontal status of ss patients, in terms of clinical and microbiological parameters, differs from systemically healthy age- and gender-matched controls. methods: 8 primary ss and 10 secondary ss patients were  examined in comparison with 11 control subjects. all patients were diagnosed by the european community criteria. control subjects were systemically healthy and not undergoing periodontal treatment. the comparison of clinical status was made  in terms of mean periodontal parameters (plaque index, gingival index, gingival recession, probing pocket depth, probing attachment level and bleeding on probing) as well as the frequency distribution of probing pocket depth and probing attachment level measurements. microbiological assays of the subgingival  dental plaque samples were carried out by both a chairside enzyme test (periocheck) for the detection of peptidase activity (pa) and a polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) analysis for 9 selected periodontal micro-organisms (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, streptococcus oralis). results: the  occurrence, severity and extent of periodontal lesions were not significantly different between the 3 patient groups for all periodontal parameters examined. no significant differences in the sub-gingival plaque samples from control, primary or secondary ss patients for the pa test, frequency or type of periodontal micro-organisms observed. conclusion: no significant differences could be detected in either clinical or microbiological parameters of primary or  secondary ss patients compared with that of control subjects. the results of the  present study thus support the notion that the periodontal status of patients with ss do not differ from systemically healthy age- and gender-matched controls.

TI  == maternal periodontitis and prematurity. part ii: maternal infection and fetal exposure.
AB  == clinical data from the first 812 deliveries from a cohort study of pregnant mothers entitled oral conditions and pregnancy (ocap) demonstrate that both antepartum maternal periodontal disease and incidence/progression of periodontal  disease are associated with preterm birth and growth restriction after adjusting  for traditional obstetric risk factors. in the current study we present measures  of maternal periodontal infection using whole chromosomal dna probes to identify  15 periodontal organisms within maternal periodontal plaque sampled at delivery.  in addition, maternal postpartum igg antibody and fetal exposure, as indexed by fetal cord blood igm level to these 15 maternal oral pathogens, was measured by whole bacterial immunoblots. the potential role of maternal infection with specific organisms within 2 bacterial complexes most often associated with periodontitis, conventionally termed "orange" (campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella nigrescens, and prevotella intermedia) and "red" (porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, and treponema denticola) complexes, respectively, to prematurity was investigated by relating the presence of oral infection, maternal igg, and fetal  cord igm, comparing full-term to preterm (gestational age < 37 weeks). the prevalence of 8 periodontal pathogens was similar among term and preterm mothers  at postpartum. there was a 2.9-fold higher prevalence of igm seropositivity for one or more organisms of the orange or red complex among preterm babies, as compared to term babies (19.9% versus 6.9%, respectively, p = 0.0015, chi square). specifically, the prevalence of positive fetal igm to c. rectus was significantly higher for preterm as compared to full-term neonates (20.0% versus  6.3%, p = 0.0002, as well as p. intermedia (8.8% versus 1.1%, p = 0.0003). a lack of maternal igg antibody to organisms of the red complex was associated with an increased rate of prematurity with an odds ratio (or) = 2.2; confidence interval  (ci) 1.48 to 3.79), consistent with the concept that maternal antibody protects the fetus from exposure and resultant prematurity. the highest rate of prematurity (66.7%) was observed among those mothers without a protective red complex igg response coupled with a fetal igm response to orange complex microbes (combined or 10.3; p < 0.0001). these data support the concept that maternal periodontal infection in the absence of a protective maternal antibody response is associated with systemic dissemination of oral organisms that translocate to the fetus resulting in prematurity. the high prevalence of elevated fetal igm to  c. rectus among premature infants raises the possibility that this specific maternal oral pathogen may serve as a primary fetal infectious agent eliciting prematurity.

TI  == inhibition of proteolytic, serpinolytic, and progelatinase-b activation activities of periodontopathogens by doxycycline and the non-antimicrobial chemically modified tetracycline derivatives.
AB  == background: tetracyclines, particularly doxycycline (doxy), and their non-antimicrobial chemically-modified derivatives (cmts) inhibit the activities of human matrix metalloproteinases (mmps), and reduce the severity and progression of periodontal disease in animal models and humans. in this study, the effects of doxy and cmt-1, -3, and -5 on proteolytic, serpinolytic, and progelatinase-b activation activities of potent periodontopathogens were studied. methods: the effect of doxy and cmts (0.5 to 50 microm) on proteolytic activities were investigated by incubating bacteria with chromogenic substrates or human serum albumin. a collagenolytic fraction of porphyromonas gingivalis was used to  evaluate the effect of these substances on collagenolytic (type i collagen) and serpinolytic (alpha1-proteinase inhibitor) activities. lastly, the effect of doxy on progelatinase-b (pro-mmp-9) activation by purified proteinases from p. gingivalis and treponema denticola was investigated by sds-page/western immunoblotting. results: doxy and cmts, except cmt-5 which lacks the structural elements required for cation chelation, inhibited arg- and lys-gingipain activities as well as collagenolytic activity of p. gingivalis. doxy and cmts did not markedly affect the chymotrypsin-like activity of t. denticola but inhibited  its trypsin-like activity. in addition, degradation of human serum albumin by cells of p. gingivalis and t. denticola was strongly inhibited by doxy and cmt-1. doxy and cmt-1 also inhibited the inactivation of alpha1-proteinase inhibitor (serpinolytic activity) by a collagenolytic fraction of p. gingivalis. lastly, doxy prevented the latent to active conversion of human neutrophil progelatinase-b (pro-mmp-9) by arg-gingipains a/b of p. gingivalis but not by the chymotrypsin-like proteinase of t. denticola. conclusions: data from this study suggest that doxy and cmts have the potential to inhibit the periodontopathogenic bacterial proteinases, which contribute to tissue destruction cascades during periodontitis directly and indirectly by triggering the host response.

TI  == periodontopathic bacterial infection in childhood.
AB  == background: little information is available on periodontopathic bacterial infection in childhood. we assessed the prevalence by age of 10 putative periodontopathic microorganisms in periodontally healthy children using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay. methods: plaque samples were collected from the buccal-mesial sulcus of the first molar or second primary molar in the right upper quadrant of 144 children (2 to 13 years old, 12 subjects from each year of age) who showed negligible periodontal inflammation. using species-specific primers of porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, and treponema denticola, pcr amplification was performed with bacterial genomic dna from plaque samples. results: the results indicated that c. rectus, e. corrodens, a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. ochracea, and c. sputigena were found in about 50% of the plaque samples from all age groups, while b. forsythus and p. intermedia were detected less frequently, and p. gingivalis and t. denticola were not found. in contrast, the percentage of p.  nigrescens-positive subjects increased with age in primary dentition, and reached about 50% at 7 years of age and older. subject-based analyses suggested that the  number of bacterial species in the plaque samples increased gradually with age until 5 years old, and then reached a plateau after the mixed dentition period. conclusions: the colonization of many putative periodontopathic microorganisms can occur quite early in childhood without clinical signs of periodontal disease. however, colonization by p. gingivalis and t. denticola was not detected in periodontally healthy children.

TI  == sulfate-reducing bacteria in relation with other potential periodontal pathogens.
AB  == background, aims: oral sulfate-reducing bacteria are involved in several clinical categories of periodontitis. the aim of this cross-sectional study was to compare the presence of sulfate-reducing bacteria (srb) with other putative pathogens including spirochetes, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola in periodontal lesions. method: periodontal srb were detected by enrichment culture and compared with a microscopic spirochete count (n=168). species-specific oligonucleotide probes directed against the 16s rrna were employed to determine the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, and t. denticola (n=55). results: a significant positive correlation was observed between the presence of  srb and the proportions of spirochetes in subgingival plaque, although the 2 bacterial groups also occurred separately. srb tended to be negatively correlated with the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans. in contrast, all pockets with srb  harbored either t. denticola, or both t. denticola and b. forsythus (12/14) before therapy. interestingly, the combination of srb with p. gingivalis occurred in 32% of the periodontal pockets before treatment. after initial periodontal therapy, the prevalence of this combination was reduced to 2% of the sites, and to 25% of the sites in recall patients. conclusion: the presence of srb was positively correlated with t. denticola, b. forsythus, and p. gingivalis in periodontal lesions. these suspected pathogens form a complex strongly associated with destructive periodontitis.

AB  == background: the aim of the present study was to identify treponema socranskii in  addition to treponema denticola and porphyromonas gingivalis by polymerase chain  reaction (pcr), and to clarify the relationship between the presence of these microorganisms and the severity of clinical periodontal parameters. methods: saliva and subgingival plaque collected from 123 subjects (38 aggressive periodontitis patients, 65 chronic periodontitis patients, 20 healthy patients) were subjected to pcr to detect the aforementioned 3 microorganisms. results: detection frequencies of t. socranskii, t. denticola, and p. gingivalis in plaque samples from aggressive periodontitis patients (71.1%, 73.7%, 84.2%, respectively) and chronic periodontitis patients (89.2%, 93.8%, 95.3%) were much  higher than those from healthy subjects (30%, 5.0%, 10.0%). in aggressive and chronic periodontitis patients, these 3 species of bacteria were detected frequently at sites that showed deep periodontal pockets and severe attachment loss. the percentage of these bacteria-positive sites increased as the gingival index score of chronic periodontitis patients increased. t. socranskii was frequently detected together with t. denticola or p. gingivalis at the same sites, and coexistence of these microorganisms was frequently observed in deep periodontal pockets of aggressive periodontitis patients. conclusions: t. socranskii, t. denticola, and p. gingivalis were frequently detected in periodontitis patients by pcr. the prevalence of these 3 microorganisms was correlated with various clinical parameters. taken together, our findings suggest that t. socranskii, t. denticola, and p. gingivalis are associated with the severity of periodontal tissue destruction.

AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

AB  == periodontal disease is perhaps the most common chronic infection in adults. evidence has been accumulating for the past 30 years which indicates that almost  all forms of periodontal disease are chronic but specific bacterial infections due to the overgrowth in the dental plaque of a finite number of mostly anaerobic species such as porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, and treponema denticola. the success of traditional debridement procedures and/or antimicrobial agents in improving periodontal health can be associated with the reduction in levels of these anaerobes in the dental plaque. these findings suggest that patients and clinicians have a choice in the treatment of this overgrowth, either a debridement and surgery approach or a debridement and antimicrobial treatment approach. however, the antimicrobial approach, while supported by a wealth of scientific evidence, goes contrary to centuries of dental teaching that states that periodontal disease results from a "dirty mouth." if periodontal disease is  demonstrated to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and stroke, it will be a modifiable risk factor since periodontal disease can be prevented and treated. since the antimicrobial approach may be as effective as a surgical approach in the restoration and maintenance of a periodontally healthy dentition, this would give a cardiac or stroke patient and his or her physician a choice in  the implementation of treatment seeking to improve the patient's periodontal condition so as to reduce and/or delay future cardiovascular events.

TI  == the opdb locus encodes the trypsin-like peptidase activity of treponema denticola.
AB  == high levels of treponema denticola in subgingival dental plaque are associated with severe periodontal disease. t. denticola, along with porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides forsythus, are the only cultivatable oral microorganisms that produce significant amounts of "trypsin-like" peptidase activity. the ability of subgingival plaque to hydrolyze n-alpha-benzoyl-dl-arginine-2-naphthylamide (bana) is associated with high levels of one or more of these organisms. the purpose of this study was to identify the  gene encoding trypsin-like activity in t. denticola and thus facilitate molecular-level studies of its potential role in disease. using published peptide sequences of a t. denticola surface-associated oligopeptidase with bana-hydrolyzing activity, we identified the gene, designated opdb, in an apparently noncoding region of the t. denticola genome unannotated contigs (11/2000; http://www.tigr.org). the opdb gene begins with a ttg start codon and encodes a 685-residue peptide with high homology to the oligopeptidase b family in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. an isogenic t. denticola opdb mutant was constructed by allelic replacement mutagenesis using an ermf/am gene cassette. the mutant lacked bana-hydrolyzing activity and had a slightly slower growth rate than the parent strain. this mutant will be used in future studies of interactions of t. denticola with host cells and tissue.

TI  == identification of oral spirochetes at the species level and their association with other bacteria in endodontic infections.
AB  == objectives: recent molecular approaches have revealed that fastidious organisms such as bacteroides forsythus and oral treponemes were frequently found in root canals with apical periodontitis. the purpose of this study was to identify the isolates of oral spirochetes at the species level in endodontic infections and to determine their association with b forsythus and porphyromonas gingivalis. study  design: seventy-nine teeth with apical periodontitis were selected for this study. after sampling from the root canals aseptically, polymerase chain reaction amplification for the 16s rrna gene was performed with eubacterial universal primers. subsequently, dot-blot hybridization was performed with 8 species-specific oligonucleotide probes. the microbial associations were analyzed by using the odds ratio. results: the most frequently found species was p gingivalis (27.4%), followed by treponema maltophilum (26%), b forsythus (16.4%), and treponema socranskii (2.7%). other treponemes, including treponema denticola, were not detected in our samples. significant microbial associations were identified between t maltophilum, b forsythus, and p gingivalis by performing analysis with the odds ratio. conclusion: our results indicate that t maltophilum should be included in etiologic studies of endodontic diseases.

TI  == sodium ion cycle in bacterial pathogens: evidence from cross-genome comparisons.
AB  == analysis of the bacterial genome sequences shows that many human and animal pathogens encode primary membrane na+ pumps, na+-transporting dicarboxylate decarboxylases or na+ translocating nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, and a number  of na+ -dependent permeases. this indicates that these bacteria can utilize na+ as a coupling ion instead of or in addition to the h+ cycle. this capability to use a na+ cycle might be an important virulence factor for such pathogens as vibrio cholerae, neisseria meningitidis, salmonella enterica serovar typhi, and yersinia pestis. in treponema pallidum, chlamydia trachomatis, and chlamydia pneumoniae, the na+ gradient may well be the only energy source for secondary transport. a survey of preliminary genome sequences of porphyromonas gingivalis,  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and treponema denticola indicates that these oral pathogens also rely on the na+ cycle for at least part of their energy metabolism. the possible roles of the na+ cycling in the energy metabolism and pathogenicity of these organisms are reviewed. the recent discovery of an effective natural antibiotic, korormicin, targeted against the na+ -translocating nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, suggests a potential use of na+ pumps as drug targets and/or vaccine candidates. the antimicrobial potential of other inhibitors of the na+ cycle, such as monensin, li+ and ag+ ions, and amiloride derivatives, is discussed.

TI  == humoral immune response in early-onset periodontitis: influence of smoking.
AB  == sixty-five patients with generalised early-onset periodontitis (g-eop) (age range 16-42 years, 32 smokers and 33 non-smokers) were assessed for antibody titres and avidity to a panel of five suspected periodontal pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus). thirty-four of these patients were untreated (17 smokers and 17 non-smokers), and thirty-one were in the maintenance phase of periodontal therapy (15 smokers and 16 non-smokers). previous studies have investigated the effect of smoking on igg levels in periodontitis patients in the context of the more extensive periodontal destruction seen in smokers. based on this literature our hypothesis was that smokers would have depressed serum igg levels directed against recognised periodontal pathogens compared with non-smokers. antibody titres were measured by elisa deploying fixed whole cells as coating. the igg response was detected with  biotin-anti-human igg and avidin-peroxidase; avidity was determined by elution with ammonium thiocyanate. median titres to a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia and t. denticola were significantly lower in maintenance patient smokers (p= 0.02, 0.02 and 0.002 respectively) but not in untreated patients. avidity to p. gingivalis was also lower in smoking maintenance patients (p = 0.003) but not in untreated patients. these findings may imply some interruption  of immune maturation in smokers following periodontal treatment.

TI  == clinical periodontal findings and microflora profiles in children with chronic neutropenia under supervised oral hygiene.
AB  == background: this is the first known case report that used a polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based method to help identify the oral microflora in patients with chronic neutropenia. in this study, we report clinical periodontal findings and microflora profiles of 2 children, 1 with severe congenital neutropenia (scn, kostmann type) and 1 with cyclic neutropenia (cn). methods: the scn patient had severe gingivitis, whereas the patient with cn had mild gingivitis in the gingival margins. monthly oral cleaning instruction and review were performed without subsequent periodontal therapy. oral hygiene conditions remained satisfactory and visible plaque was scarce, despite the persistence of mild gingivitis. under supervised oral hygiene, we examined the presence of periodontal pathogens from patient plaque samples. results: by a pcr-based method, prevotella nigrescens, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, and capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in the scn patient and p. intermedia, c.  rectus, c. gingivalis, and c. sputigena in the cn patient, suggesting the existence of periodontal pathogens. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and c. ochracea were not found in  either patient. conclusions: use of 1% povidone iodine solution and local antibiotic application under supervised oral hygiene were helpful to improve gingival conditions in patients with chronic neutropenia.

TI  == detection of putative oral pathogens in acute periradicular abscesses by 16s rdna-directed polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == a 16s rdna-directed polymerase chain reaction method was used to assess the occurrence of four black-pigmented anaerobic rods, treponema denticola, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in acute periradicular abscesses. pus was collected by aspiration from 10 cases diagnosed as acute abscesses of endodontic  origin. dna was extracted from the samples and analyzed using a polymerase chain  reaction-based identification assay. the method allowed detecting black-pigmented anaerobes in 80% of the examined abscesses. porphyromonas endodontalis was found  in 70%, t. denticola in 50%, porphyromonas gingivalis in 40%, and prevotella intermedia in 10% of the cases. p. gingivalis was always found associated with p. endodontalis. prevotella nigrescens and a. actinomycetemcomitans were not found in any pus sample. the high prevalence of p. endodontalis, t. denticola, and p. gingivalis suggests that they can play an important role in the etiology of acute periradicular abscesses.

TI  == change in subgingival microbial profiles in adult periodontitis subjects receiving either systemically-administered amoxicillin or metronidazole.
AB  == aim: the current investigation evaluated changes in levels and proportions of 40  bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples during, immediately after and up  to 1 year after metronidazole or amoxicillin therapy combined with srp. method: after baseline clinical and microbiological monitoring, 17 adult periodontitis subjects received full mouth srp and 14 days systemic administration of either metronidazole (250 mg, tid, n=8) or amoxicillin (500 mg, tid, n=9). clinical measurements including % of sites with plaque, gingival redness, bleeding on probing and suppuration, pocket depth (pd) and attachment level (al) were made at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of all teeth in each subject at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days and from 2 randomly selected posterior teeth at 3, 7, and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. counts of 40 subgingival species were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significance of differences over time was determined using the quade test and between groups using ancova. results: mean pd was reduced from 3.22+/-0.12 at baseline to 2.81+/-0.16 (p<0.01) at 360 days and  from 3.38+/-0.23 mm to 2.80+/-0.14 mm (p<0.01) in the amoxicillin and metronidazole treated subjects respectively. corresponding values for mean al were 3.21+/-0.30 to 2.76+/-0.32 (p<0.05) and 3.23+/-0.28 mm to 2.94+/-0.23 mm (p<0.01). levels and proportions of bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola were markedly reduced during antibiotic administration and were lower than baseline levels at 360 days. counts (x10(5), +/-sem) of b. forsythus fell from baseline levels of 0.66+/-0.16 to 0.04+/-0.02,  0.13+/-0.04, 0.10+/-0.03 and 0.42+/-0.19 in the amoxicillin group at 14, 90, 180  and 360 days respectively (p<0.001). corresponding values for metronidazole treated subjects were: 1.69+/-0.28 to 0.02+/-0.01, 0.20+/-0.08, 0.22+/-0.06 and 0.22+/-0.08 (p<0.001). counts of campylobacter species, eubacterium nodatum, fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, f. periodonticum and prevotella nigrescens were also detected at lower mean levels during and immediately after therapy, but gradually increased after withdrawal of the antibiotics. members of the genera actinomyces, streptococcus and capnocytophaga were minimally affected by metronidazole. however, amoxicillin decreased the counts and proportions of actinomyces species during and after therapy. conclusions: the data suggest that  metronidazole and amoxicillin are useful in rapidly lowering counts of putative periodontal pathogens, but must be accompanied by other procedures to bring about periodontal stability.

TI  == bacterial diversity in human subgingival plaque.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the bacterial diversity in the human subgingival plaque by using culture-independent molecular methods as part of an ongoing effort to obtain full 16s rrna sequences for all cultivable and not-yet-cultivated species of human oral bacteria. subgingival plaque was analyzed from healthy subjects and subjects with refractory periodontitis, adult  periodontitis, human immunodeficiency virus periodontitis, and acute necrotizing  ulcerative gingivitis. 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) bacterial genes from dna isolated from subgingival plaque samples were pcr amplified with all-bacterial or selective primers and cloned into escherichia coli. the sequences of cloned 16s rdna inserts were used to determine species identity or closest relatives by comparison with sequences of known species. a total of 2,522 clones were analyzed. nearly complete sequences of approximately 1,500 bases were obtained for putative new species. about 60% of the clones fell into 132 known species, 70 of which were identified from multiple subjects. about 40% of the clones were novel phylotypes. of the 215 novel phylotypes, 75 were identified from multiple subjects. known putative periodontal pathogens such as porphyromonas gingivalis,  bacteroides forsythus, and treponema denticola were identified from multiple subjects, but typically as a minor component of the plaque as seen in cultivable  studies. several phylotypes fell into two recently described phyla previously associated with extreme natural environments, for which there are no cultivable species. a number of species or phylotypes were found only in subjects with disease, and a few were found only in healthy subjects. the organisms identified  only from diseased sites deserve further study as potential pathogens. based on the sequence data in this study, the predominant subgingival microbial community  consisted of 347 species or phylotypes that fall into 9 bacterial phyla. based on the 347 species seen in our sample of 2,522 clones, we estimate that there are 68 additional unseen species, for a total estimate of 415 species in the subgingival plaque. when organisms found on other oral surfaces such as the cheek, tongue, and teeth are added to this number, the best estimate of the total species diversity in the oral cavity is approximately 500 species, as previously proposed.

TI  == relationship of cigarette smoking to the subgingival microbiota.
AB  == background: the relationship of cigarette smoking to the composition of the subgingival microbiota is not clear. some studies indicated higher levels of certain species in smokers, while other studies failed to detect differences in the microbiota between subjects with different smoking histories. thus, the purpose of the present investigation was to examine the prevalence, proportions and levels of the subgingival species in adult subjects who were current, past or never smokers. method: 272 adult subjects ranging in age from 20-86 years with at least 20 teeth were recruited for study. smoking history was obtained using a questionnaire. clinical measures were taken at 6 sites per tooth at all teeth excluding third molars at a baseline visit. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of all teeth excluding third molars in each subject at baseline and assayed individually for counts of 29 subgingival species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. subjects were subset according to smoking history into never (n=124), past (n=98) and current smokers (n=50). uni-variate and multi-variate analyses were used to seek associations between smoking category and the counts, proportions and prevalence of subgingival species. results: greater differences were observed for the prevalence (% of sites colonized) of the test species in the 3 smoking groups than were observed for counts or proportions of total counts. members of the orange and red complexes including e. nodatum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii, p. intermedia, p. micros, p. nigrescens, b. forsythus, p. gingivalis and t. denticola were significantly more  prevalent in current smokers than in the other 2 groups. the difference in prevalence between smokers and non-smokers was due to greater colonization at sites with pocket depth <4 mm. stepwise multiple linear regression analysis indicated that combinations of the prevalence of 5 microbial species and pack years accounted for 44% of the variance for mean pocket depth (p<0.000001), while the prevalence of 3 microbial taxa along with age, pack years, current smoking and gender accounted for 31% of the variance in mean attachment level (p<0.000001). the difference in prevalence between current and never smokers of all members of the red complex and 8 of 12 members of the orange complex was significantly greater in the maxilla than in the mandible. conclusions: the major difference between the subgingival microbiota in subjects with different smoking  history was in the prevalence of species rather than counts or proportions. the greater extent of colonization in smokers appeared to be due to greater colonization at pocket depths <4 mm. differences in colonization patterns between current and never smokers were greater in the maxilla than in the mandible.

TI  == heterogeneity of host immunological risk factors in patients with aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: the pathogenesis of early-onset periodontitis (eop) can be explained  by various host risk factors. previous studies have focused on a single (among many possible) immunological risk factor and the association among the factors has not been assessed. we comprehensively investigated the associations among multiple host immunological risk factors in eop patients to further elucidate their role in the pathogenesis of eop. methods: sixty-eight eop patients (50 generalized eop, 18 localized eop), 51 eop-suspected patients (s-eop), 43 adult periodontitis (ap) patients, and 36 periodontally healthy subjects (hs) participated in this cross-sectional study. we examined peripheral neutrophil functions, phenotypic and functional characterization of peripheral lymphocytes (lymphocyte subsets, t-cell proliferative activity), cytokine productivity (interleukin [il]-1, il-2, tumor necrosis factor [tnf]-alpha, interferon [ifn]-gamma, il-4 and il-6), serum immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody titers against 12 periodontal bacteria, and hla class ii genotypes. results: g-eop, s-eop, and ap patient groups showed significantly lower percentages of pan t cells and cd8-positive cells (p < 0.02) compared with the hs group. l-eop patients showed depressed il-4 and tnf-alpha productivity compared with the hs group (p < 0.02).  the eop group showed significantly elevated antibody levels against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and fusobacterium nucleatum compared with the hs group (p < 0.05). the frequency with dqb1*0503 was significantly higher in the eop patient group than the hs group (p = 0.045) due to the higher frequency in l-eop patients than the hs group (p = 0.035). there were wide interindividual variations in each of the tests among patient and hs groups; however, eop patients showed wider intradiagnostic group variations in certain host defensive cell functions than the other groups. there were some eop patients who showed extremely low or high values in some tests; the eop patients could be further divided into subgroups according to their host defensive and immunological profiles. however, there was  heterogeneity in some of the other host immunological tests even in the subgroups. conclusions: the association of host immunological risk factors in eop patients is widely varied and more complex than previously thought. these results indicate the difficulty of explaining the pathogenesis of eop based on a single host risk factor and also emphasize the importance of critical assessment of not  only eop patient groups, but also individual patients.

TI  == relationship of periodontopathic bacteria with early-onset periodontitis in down's syndrome.
AB  == background: down's syndrome (ds) patients often develop severe early-onset marginal periodontitis in early adulthood; however, there is little information available on the microbiology of ds periodontitis. methods: subgingival plaque specimens were taken from 67 ds young adults and 41 age-matched systemically healthy individuals with mental disabilities (md). the prevalence of 10 possible  periodontopathic bacterial species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola, prevotella  intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens, were investigated in their subgingival plaque samples using a polymerase chain reaction method. the detection of p. gingivalis fima genotypes was also performed in p. gingivalis-positive samples. results: although ds subjects generally develop an earlier and more extensive periodontal breakdown than those with md, no significant differences were observed in the bacterial profiles. the profiles of  subjects with periodontitis were significant in ds, but not in md. the prevalence of p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, and p. intermedia were significant in the ds periodontitis group, compared to ds gingivitis group. moreover, the occurrence of p. gingivalis with the type ii fima gene was significantly related to periodontitis in both ds and md, with odds ratios of 6.32 and 12.03, respectively. conclusions: these results suggest that early-onset periodontitis in ds is mainly due to the more susceptible host for the causative microbial agents including p. gingivalis with type ii fima.

AB  == objective: the "red complex," composed of bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola, is implicated in severe forms of periodontal diseases. the purpose of this study was to assess the occurrence of the red complex in root canal infections through the use of a sensitive technique-the 16s rdna-directed polymerase chain reaction (pcr). study design: samples were obtained from 50 necrotic pulps with periradicular pathosis. ten cases were diagnosed as acute periradicular abscesses. dna was extracted from the samples and analyzed with a pcr-based identification assay. results: at least 1 member of the red complex was found in 33 of 50 cases. t denticola, p gingivalis, and b forsythus were detected in 44%, 30%, and 26% of the cases, respectively. the red  complex was found in 4 of 50 cases. no particular signs or symptoms were associated with the presence of these bacterial species. conclusions: despite what is indicated in reports with respect to marginal periodontitis, red complex  bacteria-either singularly or collectively-was not associated with any particular pattern of clinical symptoms. however, because the bacterial species from the red complex are recognized oral pathogens, their occurrence in root canal infections  suggests that they may play a role in the pathogenesis of periradicular diseases.

TI  == role of bacterial proteinases in matrix destruction and modulation of host responses.
AB  == recently accumulated large bodies of evidence have strongly implicated proteolytic enzymes released by subgingival plaque bacteria in the pathogenicity  of periodontal disease. with regard to proteolytic power, however, the contribution from different microbial species considered as periodontal pathogens is not equal. two of these bacteria, p. gingivalis and t. denticola, have developed an elaborate proteolytic systems composed of several surface-located or secreted enzymes, which apparently serve a role to provide bacteria with nutrients in the form of small peptides and amino acids. of these two species, proteinases of p. gingivalis are the most intensively studied, and during the last decade an impressive array of information has been accumulated with respect  to the biochemical characterization of purified proteinases and structure of the  genes encoding them, the regulation of expression and the effects of these enzymes on host systems. in addition, studies on proteinase-deficient isogenic mutants has shed light on both their housekeeping functions and potential role(s) in the pathogenicity of periodontitis. among several proteinases produced by p. gingivalis, the cysteine proteinases, referred to as gingipains, are clearly in the spotlight. they are the subject of several recent reviews and generally considered as the major virulence factors of this periodontal pathogen (59, 105,  139, 182, 183, 186, 281, 284, 286, 289). gingipains seem to be key players in subverting host defense systems with, significantly, the complement and neutrophils being the main target. in addition, through uncontrolled activation of kallikrein/kinin pathway and coagulation cascade they contribute to local generation of bradykinin and thrombin, two synergistically working pro-inflammatory reagents with a strongly, although indirectly, stimulatory effect on bone resorption. furthermore, the ability to interact with the cytokine networking systems has the potential to dysregulate the local inflammatory reaction. finally, gingipains have a strong effect on mechanisms controlling host matrix metalloproteinase activity at the level of gene expression and zymogen activation (fig. 10). collectively, at the periodontal lesion site, the non-restrained action of gingipains, supported by other proteinases locally produced by subgingival plaque bacteria, would dysregulate most mechanisms controlling inflammatory reaction. although successful in limiting infection to the periodontium, the ultimate effect of uncontrolled inflammatory processes would be the destruction of periodontal connective tissue, certainly the hallmark of periodontitis.

TI  == rapid detection and quantification of five periodontopathic bacteria by real-time pcr.
AB  == the quantity of periodontopathic bacteria in plaque samples is an important determinant for understanding the etiologic role of bacteria. the real-time pcr method was used to detect and quantify periodontopathic bacteria, such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and treponema socranskii, in saliva and subgingival plaque samples. there was good agreement between the results of conventional pcr and real-time pcr methods. using the lightcycler system we were  able to determine the amount of periodontopathic bacteria within an hour. the real-time pcr method was linear for samples containing from 10(3) to more than 10(8) cells (r2 = 0.999). the application of the real-time pcr method should be useful in the rapid detection and quantification of periodontopathic bacteria in  clinical samples.

TI  == detection of putative periodontal pathogens in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and non-diabetes mellitus by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == it has been assumed that there is a relationship between periodontal diseases and diabetes mellitus, however the putative periodontal microorganisms in non-diabetes mellitus (non-dm) individuals and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (niddm) patients have not been well studied. in this study, the detection rates of 5 putative periodontal pathogens: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, treponema denticola, and candida albicans by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) between niddm  and non-dm adults were compared. a total of 246 adults were randomly recruited and periodontal parameters including: plaque index (p1i), gingival index (gi), probing depth (pd) and attachment level (al) were recorded. subgingival plaque samples were collected by sterile curettes from the most diseased and healthy sites based on pd and al. the differences in periodontal parameters and microbiological data in healthy and diseased sites between non-dm and niddm patients were compared by chi-square analysis. the results showed no significant  differences in age, gender, gi, p1i, pd, and prevalence of the 5 microorganisms between the niddm and the non-diabetic groups. however, except for a. actinomycetemcomitans, the prevalence of the periodontal microorganisms tested was significantly higher (p <0.001) in diseased sites than in the healthy sites in both groups. the p1i, gi, pd and al were significantly higher in t. denticola  positive sites than in negative sites. the results suggested that p. gingivalis,  t. denticola, e. corrodens and c. albicans may play important roles in the periodontitis of both niddm and non-dm individuals, however the etiology of periodontitis in both groups may not be different from each other.

AB  == the relationship between the detection of porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus and treponema denticola in subgingival plaque samples of periodontal pockets and periodontal status was evaluated using the polymerase chain reaction  (pcr). a total of 165 sites in 60 periodontitis patients were examined, and the relationships between the detection of each of the three bacterial species and the pocket depth and bleeding on probing (bop) were analyzed. the detection ratios of p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, and t. denticola in samples from adult periodontitis lesions were 75.5%, 69.8%, and 72.6%, respectively. it was found that all sites where all three microorganisms were detected were bop positive and had greater pocket depths than those where only one or two species were found. the detection rate of b. forsythus and t. denticola decreased with age in the sites in which pd was less than 4 mm. the present study indicates that detection  of a mixed infection by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, and t. denticola strongly correlated with adult periodontitis.

AB  == a random sample of sixty-two 11-15-year-old adolescents from 17 different locations in guatemala were selected for this study. pocket depth, plaque index,  and bleeding upon probing were recorded from 6 randomly selected sites in each subject (a total of 372 sites). subgingival plaque samples were subsequently collected from these sites and processed by several assays. for cost reasons, in  each pair of sites different assays were performed as follows: sites #1, #2--bana test for t. denticola, p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and screening of plaque samples with polyclonal antibodies (elisa system) for a. actinomycetemcomitans; sites #3, #4--detection of yeasts by sab agar; sites #5, #6--detection of entamoeba gingivalis by the heidenhain iron hematoxylin modified technique. a total of 66% of the children had at least one site that bled upon probing, 42% exhibited at least one site with pocket depth > 3 mm, and 79% exhibited a high plaque index, with the percent of sites affected being 30%, 12% and 41%, respectively. in sites #1, #2 (n = 124), the bana test assay and a. actinomycetemcomitans tested positive in 77% and 47% of the children accounting for 59% and 31% of the sites, respectively. in sites #3, #4 (n = 124), yeasts were detected in 43% of the children and 29% of the sites. in sites #5, #6 (n = 124), entamoeba gingivalis was detected in 21% of the children and in 11% of the  sites. the risk for severe gingival inflammation and/or increased probing depth was 1.5 and 5.2 times higher if a positive bana test or a. actinomycetemcomitans  test was found in a particular site. no associations could be found for yeasts and entamoeba gingivalis.

TI  == the relationship between place bana reactivity and clinical parameters in subjects with mental disabilities.
AB  == the purpose of the present investigation was to determine whether subjects institutionalized with mental retardation have a relationship between periodontal clinical parameters and the presence of the bana-positive periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalls, treponema denticola, and bacteroides forsythus in their subgingival plaques. fifty institutionalized subjects (25 patients with down syndrome and 25 subjects with mental retardation) were matched with respect to age and sex. periodontal clinical parameters (bleeding on probing, bop; papillary bleeding score, pbs; and probing depth, pd) were obtained from 6 reference teeth  (3, 8, 14, 19, 24, 30). in addition, subgingival plaque samples taken from the same 6 teeth were analyzed for the presence of the bana-positive species, by means of the chairside bana test. in both the patients with down syndrome and the group with mental retardation, the presence of bana-positive plaques was significantly associated with bleeding on probing (p < 0.05) and increased probing depth (p < 0.01, chi-square). analysis of these data indicated that the bana test could be used in combination with clinical criteria to diagnose a periodontopathy anaerobic infection in institutionalized subjects.

TI  == comparison of profiles of key periodontal pathogens in periodontium and endodontium.
AB  == despite the established anatomical relationship between the periodontal and pulpal tissues, bacterial migration between endodontium and periodontium is still under discussion. the objective of this study was an investigation of profiles of periodontal pathogens in pulpal and periodontal diseases affecting the same tooth by means of 16s rrna gene directed polymerase chain reaction (pcr). 31 intact teeth with both pulp and marginal infections were investigated. the diagnosis was based on clinical and radiological examination. samples were taken from the gingival sulcus or periodontal pocket, respectively, with sterile paper points before trepanation of the teeth. after trepanation sterile paper points and hedstroem files were used for taking samples from the root canal. specific pcr methods were used to detect the presence of the following pathogens: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola. in addition, quantitative competitive pcr was used to determine the total bacterial count of the samples. the investigated pathogens were proven to be present in the endondontium in all disease categories. particularly in endodontic samples of "chronic apical periodontitis" and "chronic adult periodontitis" profiles of the periodontal pathogens were found. the results confirmed that periodontal pathogens often accompany endodontic infections and supported the idea that the periodontic-endodontic interrelationships should be considered as critical pathways which might contribute to refractory courses of endodontic or periodontal diseases.

TI  == assessment of periradicular microbiota by dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == in the present study the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technique was used  to identify bacteria in periapical endodontic lesions of asymptomatic teeth. thirty-four patients with root-filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. in group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. the gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. bacterial dna was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. the mean number (+/- sd) of species detected was 33.7 +/- 3.3 in group 1 and 21.3 +/- 6.3 in group 2 (p < 0.001). the majority of the probe-detected bacteria were present in more lesions from group 1 than from group 2. the differences were most notable for campylobacter gracilis, porphyromonas endodontalis, propionibacterium acnes, capnocytophaga gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, streptococcus constellatus and actinomyces naeslundii i. bacterial species such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. also, p. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. the data supported the idea that  following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon-released bacteremia. the study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. the detection of much more bacteria with the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.

TI  == anaerobic periodontal infections as risk factors for medical diseases.
AB  == advanced forms of periodontal disease are associated with the overgrowth of a limited number of gram-negative anaerobic species in plaques found in periodontal pockets. double-blind clinical trials of metronidazole and doxycycline, combined  with debriding of the tooth surfaces, have significantly reduced the need for periodontal surgery. epidemiologic studies have indicated that untreated periodontal disease could be a risk factor for preterm delivery of low birth weight infants, coronary heart disease, and cerebral vascular accidents. this is  because gram-negative anaerobic species implicated in periodontal disease, eg, bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola, could introduce lipopolysaccharides, heat-shock proteins, and proinflammatory cytokines into the blood stream. if periodontal disease is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, then it is a modifiable risk factor, as periodontal disease is treatable.

TI  == measurement of proteases in human subgingival dental plaque by fluorescence polarization.
AB  == fluorescence polarization (fp) was examined as a rapid quantitative method to assay the proteases in subgingival plaque. protease activity was measured by a decrease in fp at 0.5-min intervals over 5 min, using bodipy-alpha-casein, a protein substrate. to quantitate activity, the least absolute deviation (lad) slope for each assay was determined. protease activity increased with the quantity of plaque (r=0.416, p<0.001). of the 208 subgingival plaque samples, 87  contained detectable protease activity, with a mean of about 4 microg trypsin equivalents above a general background of 1 microg per site. the mean plaque protease activity of 89 paired samples from 15 individuals had decreased by 1.1 microg trypsin equivalents per site when measured at 8 months after tooth scaling and root planing (p<0.01). most isolates of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, prevotella nigrescens, and prevotella intermedia implicated in the pathogenesis of adult periodontitis exhibited high activity in the fp assay. the  assay is rapid, quantitative and requires only one-tenth of the plaque sampled using a single pass with a gracey curette at a single tooth site.

TI  == microbiological parameters associated with il-1 gene polymorphisms in periodontitis patients.
AB  == background, aims: polymorphisms in the cluster of il-1 genes have been significantly associated with the severity of adult periodontitis. the purpose of this study was to compare microbiological parameters in il-1 genotype negative and positive adult subjects with a range of periodontitis severities. method: the study included 108 subjects in good general health. clinical parameters were recorded at 6 sites/tooth excluding 3rd molars and included: plaque accumulation, gingival erythema, bleeding on probing, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment  level. subgingival plaque samples were collected from the mesiobuccal surface of  up to 28 teeth in each subject (mean 25.3) providing a total of 2736 samples. the levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in each sample using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. fingerstick blood samples were collected for il-1a (+4845) and il-1b (+3954) genotyping using pcr-based methods. results: the proportion of  il-1 genotype positive subjects that exhibited mean counts of specific subgingival species above selected thresholds was significantly higher than the proportion of genotype negative subjects. prominent among species that were detected at higher levels in genotype positive subjects were members of the "red" and "orange" complexes and included: bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola,  the fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, fusobacterium periodonticum, campylobacter gracilis, campylobacter showae and streptococcus constellatus. streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus gordonii and 3 capnocytophaga species were also detected more frequently at high numbers in genotype positive subjects. significantly higher mean counts of b. forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, t. denticola, the f. nucleatum subspecies, f. periodonticum, campylobacter rectus, c. showae, eubacterium nodatum, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, and s. intermedius  were detected at periodontal pockets >6 mm in subjects who were genotype positive when compared with genotype negative subjects. the increase was due to increased  numbers of cells of these species rather than a major shift in proportion. conclusion: the data suggest that genotype positive subjects more frequently had  higher levels of "red" and "orange" complex species that are known to be strongly associated with measures of periodontal inflammation.

TI  == prevalence of periodontal pathogens in localized and generalized forms of early-onset periodontitis.
AB  == the primary objectives of this study were to investigate the prevalence of 8 putative periodontal pathogens in subjects with early-onset periodontitis (eop) and to evaluate the microbial differences between localized and generalized forms of this periodontal disease condition. thirty-one females and 11 males with a mean age of 30.3 (s.d. 4.0) years were examined. seventeen subjects had generalized (geop) and 25 had localized early-onset periodontitis (leop). subgingival plaque samples were assayed using pcr which provided subject prevalence data for the pathogens; bacteroides forsythus 78.6%, treponema denticola 88.1%, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans 19.0%, porphyromonas gingivalis 16.7%, prevotella intermedia 40.4%, prevotella nigrescens 61.9%, eikenella corrodens 42.3% and campylobacter rectus 92.8%. only 3 healthy sites harbored one or more of these periodontal pathogens. seven of the 8 subjects positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans had leop. p. intermedia was present in 58.8% of geop compared with 28% of leop subjects (p=0.046). at 82.4% of geop sites p. nigrescens was present while this bacteria was detected at 52% of leop (p=0.044). p. gingivalis was isolated from 22.6% of females but no male subjects  (p=0.084). c. rectus was recovered from all female subjects compared to 72.7% of  males (p=0.014). a. actinomycetemcomitans (37.5%) and c. rectus (86.5%) were more frequently identified in non-smokers compared to 7.6% and 68.8% of smokers, respectively (p <0.05). microbial associations coincided with the clinical division of the cases into leop and geop in 83% of the subjects.

TI  == comparison of the microbiota of supra- and subgingival plaque in health and periodontitis.
AB  == background, aims: the purpose of the present investigation was to compare the microbial composition of supra and subgingival plaque in 22 periodontally healthy (mean age 32+/-16 years) and 23 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 51+/-14 years). methods: a total of 2358 supra and separately subgingival plaque samples  were collected from the mesial aspect of all teeth excluding 3rd molars in each subject. samples were examined for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level, were made at 6 sites per tooth. mean counts (x10(5), % dna probe count and % sites colonized for each species were determined separately for supra and subgingival samples in each subject and then averaged across subjects in the 2 clinical groups. significance of differences between healthy and periodontitis subjects was determined using the mann-whitney test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: mean total dna probe counts (x10(5),  +/-sem) for healthy and periodontitis subjects in supragingival plaque were 72.1+/-11 and 132+/-17.5, respectively (p<0.01), and in subgingival plaque 22.1+/-6.6 and 100.3+/-18.4, (p<0.001). porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus and treponema denticola could be detected in supragingival plaque samples of both healthy and periodontitis subjects. actinomyces species were the  dominant taxa in both supra- and subgingival plaque from healthy and periodontitis subjects. 4 actinomyces species accounted for 63.2%, of supragingival and 47.2% of subgingival plaque in healthy subjects and 48.% and 37.8% in periodontitis subjects respectively. increased proportions of p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, and species of prevotella, fusobacterium, campylobacter and treponema were detected subgingivally in the periodontitis subjects. p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and t. denticola were significantly more prevalent in both supra- and subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis subjects. conclusions: the main differences between supra and subgingival plaque as well as between health and disease were in the proportions and to some extent levels of actinomyces, "orange" and "red" complex species.

TI  == the effect of repeated professional supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the supra- and subgingival microbiota.
AB  == background, aims: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of weekly professionally administered supragingival plaque removal on the  composition of the supra and subgingival microbiota. methods: 18 adult subjects with periodontitis who had been treated and were in a maintenance phase of therapy were clinically and microbiologically monitored at baseline, 3, 6 and 12  months. after the baseline visit, the subjects received scaling and root planing  followed by professional supragingival plaque removal every week for 3 months. clinical measures of plaque accumulation, bleeding on probing (bop), gingival redness, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment level were made at 6 sites per  tooth at each visit. separate supra (n = 1804) and subgingival (n = 1804) plaque  samples were taken from the mesial aspect of all teeth excluding third molars in  each subject at each time point and evaluated for their content of 40 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significance of changes in mean counts, prevalence and proportions of bacterial species over time in both supra and subgingival samples were determined using the quade test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: mean % of sites exhibiting plaque, gingival redness and bop were significantly reduced during the course of the study. significant decreases in mean counts were observed in both supra and subgingival  samples. mean total dna probe counts (x10(5), +/-sem) at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months were: 133+/-19, 95+/-25, 66+/-6, 41+/-6 (p<0.001) for supragingival samples and 105+/-22, 40+/-10, 19+/-4, 13+/-3 (p<0.001) for subgingival samples.  mean counts of 22 of 40 and 34 of 40 species tested were significantly reduced in the supra and subgingival samples respectively over the monitoring period. for example, mean counts of porphyromonas gingivalis x10(5) at baseline, 3, 6 and 12  months in the subgingival plaque samples were 2.0+/-0.4, 0.5+/-0.2, 0.6+/-0.3, 0.3+/-0.1 (p<0.001); bacteroides forsythus 2.0+/-0.6, 0.4+/-0.1, 0.4+/-0.2, 0.1+/-0.2 (p<0.001); treponema denticola 3.4+/-1.1, 0.8+/-0.3, 0.4+/-0.2, 0.3+/-0.3 (p<0.01). similar reductions were seen in supragingival plaque samples. while counts were markedly reduced by professional plaque removal, the proportion and prevalence of the 40 test species were marginally affected. conclusions: weekly professional supragingival plaque removal profoundly diminished counts of  both supra- and subgingival species creating a microbial profile comparable to that observed in periodontal health. this profile was maintained at the final monitoring visit, 9 months after completion of therapy.

TI  == identification of periodontal disease-associated bacteria in the "plaque-free zone".
AB  == background: subgingival plaque bacteria live within a biofilm covered with glycocalyx, and little is known of the bacterial species associated with biofilm  formation at the bottom of human periodontal pockets, the so-called "plaque-free  zone"(pfz). methods: seventy-seven extracted teeth from 56 patients with severe advanced adult periodontitis were examined. porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, prevotella nigrescens, and actinomyces viscosus were examined by scanning immunoelectron microscopic techniques, using both secondary and back-scattered imaging, with rabbit antibodies specific for each bacteria. results: secondary electron images showed  that rods, filaments, and spirochete-shaped bacteria formed small aggregates in the pfz. some of the bacteria were covered with an amorphous film-like structure. by back-scattered electron imaging, positive reactions with anti-p. gingivalis were found in 8 of 13 samples examined, and film-like structures coated several cells of 6 positive samples examined. labeled cells with anti-c. rectus, anti-t.  denticola and anti-p. nigrescens were detected in 3 of 11, 5 of 10, and 1 of 8 samples examined. a. viscosus were found in 6 of 11 of the samples. a. viscosus tended to overlay the amorphous capsula and aggregate. f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans were not detected in any samples examined. conclusions: these findings indicated that p. gingivalis, c. rectus, t. denticola, p. nigrescens, and a. viscosus were present in the pfz, and that some specified bacteria were possibly related to plaque-biofilm formation of subgingival plaque.

TI  == interleukin-8 and granulocyte elastase in gingival crevicular fluid in relation to periodontopathogens in untreated adult periodontitis.
AB  == background: this study aimed to determine the relationships among interleukin (il)-8 and granulocyte elastase levels in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) and the concomitant presence of periodontopathogens in untreated adult periodontitis. methods: gcf and subgingival plaque samples were collected from 16 patients with  untreated adult periodontitis and 10 healthy control subjects. il-8 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). granulocyte elastase was analyzed with a neutrophilic granulocyte-specific, low molecular weight and chromogenic substrate, l-pyroglutamyl-l-prolyl-l-valine-p-nitroanilide, and the maximal rate of elastase activity (mr-ea) was calculated. five dna probes were used to detect the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), b. forsythus (b.f.), p. gingivalis (p.g.), p. intermedia (p.i.), and t. denticola (t.d.). results: lower il-8 concentrations and higher granulocyte elastase activities were found in patients than in healthy controls as well as in diseased conditions co-infected with b.f., p.g., p.i., and t.d. as compared to healthy conditions without the target species (p <0.05). il-8 concentrations were positively correlated with mr-ea levels in the periodontitis conditions co-infected with b.f., p.g., p.i., and t.d. (p <0.05). a wide range of il-8 concentrations was found among 15 patients when the periodontitis condition was characterized by co-infection with b.f., p.g., p.i., and t.d. mr-ea levels in the high il-8 group  of subjects were significantly higher than those in the low il-8 group of subjects (p <0.01). conclusions: the present study shows that the local host-bacteria interactions in untreated periodontitis are diverse in terms of the intensity of inflammatory responses measured by il-8-related granulocyte elastase activity in gcf. this might reflect different phases of the inflammatory response due to shifts in host-bacteria interactions and therefore be indicative of a range of periodontal disease activity levels.

TI  == "checkerboard" assessments of periodontal microbiota and serum antibody responses: a case-control study.
AB  == background: we explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum igg responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. methods: one hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients  aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject;  2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic dna probes. serum igg antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. results: cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, eubacterium nodatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of eikenella corrodens, veillonella  parvula, and actinomyces naeslundii in controls. cases displayed higher igg levels against p. gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against f. nucleatum, t. denticola, e. nodatum,  and capnocytophaga ochracea. positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. in cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species  out of which only one was positive (v. parvula). both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. a logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. conclusion: a combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.

TI  == microbial comparison of smoker and non-smoker adult and early-onset periodontitis patients by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == a number of bacterial species are involved in the aetiology of periodontitis and  include actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus and treponema denticola. several studies have shown differences in the microflora between the various forms of periodontal disease. it is recognised that smoking is a risk factor for periodontal disease, but there are conflicting reports on whether or not smoking  has an effect on the periodontal microflora. we utilised the polymerase chain reaction to determine the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, b. forsythus and t. denticola in subgingival plaque samples in 33 adult periodontitis (ap) patients and 24 generalized early-onset periodontitis (geop) patients prior to treatment. when geop and ap patients were compared there were significant differences in the number of positive patients and sites for both a. actinomycetemcomitans and b. forsythus (p=0.0023 and 0.00001, respectively). no statistically significant differences in the prevalence of these organisms were found between smoker and non-smoker groups. these results confirm that ap and geop sites harbour varied microflora, but show that b. forsythus and a. actinomycetemcomitans were detected to a significantly greater extent in this group of geop than in the ap patients investigated. our findings do not support the hypothesis that smokers have significant differences in the prevalence of periodontal pathogens from non-smokers.

AB  == objective: the purpose of this investigation was to examine the microbiota of infected root canals by using a molecular genetic method. study design: the presence and levels of 42 bacterial species were determined in 28 root canal samples by using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. to confirm the presence of bacterial dna in clinical samples, a polymerase chain  reaction with an ubiquitous bacterial primer was undertaken. results: the results of the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization analysis showed that 22 of the 42 dna probes tested were reactive with 1 or more samples. the number of bacterial species in the root canal samples ranged from 1 to 17 (mean, 4.7). seventeen of the 28 root canal samples were positive for at least 1 dna probe. the most prevalent species found were as follows: bacteroides forsythus (39. 3% of the cases); haemophilus aphrophilus (25%); corynebacterium matruchotii (21.4%); porphyromonas gingivalis (17.9%); and treponema denticola (17.9%). conclusions: the microbiologic data of the present investigation indicated that molecular genetic methods can provide significant additional knowledge regarding the endodontic microbiota by detecting bacterial species that are difficult or impossible to culture. in addition, our findings support the current concept that endodontic infections are mixed infections of polymicrobial etiology.

TI  == periodontopathic bacteria in english hiv-seropositive persons.
AB  == selected periodontopathic bacteria were sought in 20 hiv-infected english patients and eight noninfected control subjects with similar periodontal status,  using highly specific dna probes. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a. a), porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum were more frequently detected and were found at higher levels in hiv-infected individuals than in controls. significantly increased levels of treponema denticola but, in contrast, lower levels of eikenella corrodens were found in nonbleeding sites of hiv-infected patients compared with  controls. the results of the present investigation on english patients suggest a  periodontopathogenic role for a. a, p. gingivalis and c. rectus, and possibly p.  intermedia and are in general accord with most previously reported data from the  united states. longitudinal studies are now required to determine more precisely  the association between periodontopathic microflora, immune competence and periodontal health and disease in hiv-infected persons.

TI  == the prevalence of pathogenic periodontal microflora in healthy young adult smokers.
AB  == background: smoking is a major risk factor in periodontitis, although the mechanisms of its effects are not well understood. the overall goal of this clinical study was to determine if smoking enhances the colonization of the oral  cavity by pathogenic bacteria in a periodontitis-free population. the prevalence  of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, bacteroides forsythus, and treponema denticola was investigated in 25 smokers and 25 non-smokers by using dna probes. methods: the subjects were 21 to 35 years of  age with a healthy periodontium or slight gingivitis and were systemically healthy. the test group included subjects who had a minimum of a 1.5 pack-year history of smoking, while the control subjects never smoked. subgingival plaque samples were taken by paper point following the assessment of multiple clinical parameters. results: this investigation showed: 1) no statistically significant differences were noted in any clinical parameter measured between the groups; 2)  of the 8 subjects who were infected by at least 1 tested pathogen, seven were smokers (p= 0.02); 3) infected smokers had a 15.7+/-3.5 pack-year history and smoked a mean of 27+/-5 cigarettes/day versus 4.4+/-0.8 pack years and 15+/-1 cigarettes/day for the non-infected smokers (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.004); and 4) smokers were 18 times more likely to exhibit the presence of pathogens than non-smokers. conclusions: these data indicate that the prevalence of colonization of the sulcus by pathogenic bacterial species in periodontitis-free individuals is related to the quantity and duration of cigarette smoking.

TI  == herpesviruses in human periodontal disease.
AB  == recent studies have identified various herpesviruses in human periodontal disease. epstein-barr virus type 1 (ebv-1) infects periodontal b-lymphocytes and  human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) infects periodontal monocytes/ macrophages and t-lymphocytes. ebv-1, hcmv and other herpesviruses are present more frequently in periodontitis lesions and acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis-lesions than in gingivitis or periodontally healthy sites. reactivation of hcmv in periodontitis  lesions tends to be associated with progressing periodontal disease. herpesvirus-associated periodontitis lesions harbor elevated levels of periodontopathic bacteria, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteriodes forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola. it may be that active periodontal  herpesvirus infection impairs periodontal defenses, thereby permitting subgingival overgrowth of periodontopathic bacteria. alteration between latent and active herpesvirus infection in the periodontium might lead to transient local immunosuppression and explain in part the episodic progressive nature of human periodontitis. tissue tropism of herpesvirus infections might help explain  the localized pattern of tissue destruction in periodontitis. absence of herpesvirus infection or viral reactivation might explain why some individuals carry periodontopathic bacteria while still maintaining periodontal health. further studies are warranted to delineate whether the proposed herpesvirus-periodontopathic bacteria model might account for some of the pathogenic features of human periodontal disease.

AB  == guided tissue regeneration (gtr) techniques are increasingly used for the treatment of periodontal defects, or in conjunction with dental implant procedures. as adhesion of bacteria to barrier membranes used in these techniques may lead to failure, a prerequisite for treatment success is an infection-free healing process. the present study examined the adhesion of 3 periodontal pathogenic bacteria: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola and porphyromonas gingivalis, to 3 barrier membranes: collagen, (biomend) ptfe, (tefgen-fd) and e-ptfe, (gore-tex). the membranes were incubated with 3[h]-thymidine labeled bacteria, and the number of adherent bacteria was calculated using a scintillation counter. the effect of albumin coating on bacterial adherence to the membranes was also studied. bacterial adherence to the membranes was further examined by scanning electron microscopy (sem). the results show that the adherence of all bacterial strains to collagen membranes was significantly higher than to the other membranes tested. precoating of the membranes with albumin did not change the bacterial adherence significantly. these findings are of importance in evaluating the ability of periodontal bacteria to colonize and infect different types of barrier membranes.

TI  == periodontopathic bacteria in children with down syndrome.
AB  == background: it is widely known that individuals with down syndrome (ds) often develop severe early-onset periodontal diseases. in this study, we examined the prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in ds children to determine if specific pathogens are acquired in their childhood. methods: the subjects were 60 ds children (2 to 13 years old, 5 in each age bracket) and 60 age-matched controls.  ten pathogens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, p nigrescens,  capnocytophaga ochracea, c. sputigena, campyrobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens were surveyed in subgingival plaque samples using a polymerase chain reaction. periodontal status was evaluated by probing depth, bleeding on probing, and gingival index. results: no significant difference in periodontal status was  observed between the ds and control groups, however, all of the pathogens were detected with greater frequency in the ds children. b. forsythus, t. denticola, p. nigrescens, and c. rectus were significantly prevalent throughout all age brackets of the ds children (p <0.01 or 0.05). the occurrence of p. gingivalis was also significant in the ds subjects over 5 years old. a cluster analysis of the microbial profiles of the ds subjects showed that gingivitis severity was associated with increased varieties of the harboring pathogens and the distribution of p. gingivalis. conclusions: these results suggest that various periodontopathogens can colonize in the very early childhood of ds patients and maturation of subgingival components, including p. gingivalis, plays an important role in the initiation of gingival inflammation.

TI  == epithelial cell response to challenge of bacterial lipoteichoic acids and lipopolysaccharides in vitro.
AB  == accumulating dental plaque at the gingival margin contains lipoteichoic acids (ltas) from the cell walls of gram-positive bacteria. in subgingival plaque associated with periodontal disease the amount of lipopolysaccharides (lpss) from gram-negative bacteria increases. as the gingival junctional epithelium (je) is an important structural and functional tissue, participating in the first line defence against apical advancement of dental plaque, this study examined the direct effects of ltas (from streptococcus mutans and s. sanguis) and lpss (from  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and escherichia coli) on two epithelial cell lines (hacat and erm) and  a culture model for human je. the cells were exposed to the ltas or lpss (10-50 microg/ml) for variable periods of time. none of the bacterial surface components had any effect on primary adhesion or on the epithelial attachment of the je cultures. however, cell growth and mitotic activity were consistently reduced in  all cultures treated with ltas. in contrast, lpss showed only slight or no effects on cell growth and mitotic activity depending on the epithelial cells used. this suggests that lpss, despite their established role as modulators of inflammation, do not have direct harmful effects - at the concentrations found in dental plaque and gingival crevicular fluid - which would explain the mechanism of epithelial degeneration and detachment from the tooth surface. however, the ltas appear to inhibit the renewal of epithelium and may thus contribute to degeneration of coronal je and subgingival colonisation by periodontal pathogens.

TI  == the effect of scaling and root planing on the clinical and microbiological parameters of periodontal diseases: 12-month results.
AB  == background/aims: previously, we reported that srp resulted in a decrease in mean  pocket depth and attachment level and reduced prevalence and levels of bacteroidesforsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola at 3 and  6 months post-srp in 57 subjects with adult periodontitis. 32 of the 57 subjects  were monitored at 9 and 12 months. thus, the purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate the microbial and clinical effects of srp in 32 (mean age 48+/-11) subjects over a 12-month period. method: clinical assessments of plaque, gingival redness, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth and attachment level were made prior to srp and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-therapy. subgingival plaque samples were taken at each visit and analyzed using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique for the presence and levels of 40 subgingival species. each subject also received maintenance scaling at each of the subsequent monitoring visits. differences in clinical parameters and prevalence and levels of bacterial species were analyzed pre- and post-therapy using the wilcoxon signed ranks test. the quade test for related samples was used for analysis of multiple visits. results: mean pocket depth (mm+/-sem) decreased  from 3.2+/-0.3 at baseline to 2.9+/-0.3 at 12 months (p<0.01). mean attachment level showed significant reduction at 6 months, but did not diminish further. bleeding on probing and plaque were significantly reduced at 12 months (p<0.001,  p<0.05, respectively). p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and t. denticola decreased in  prevalence and levels up to the 6-month visit and remained at these lower levels  at 9 and 12 months. significant increases in levels and prevalence were noted at  12 months for actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium nucleatum ss polymorphum, streptococcus mitis, capnocytophaga sp, and veillonella parvula. conclusions: the data suggest that the maintenance phase of therapy may be essential in consolidating clinical and microbiological improvements achieved as a result of initial therapy.

TI  == perturbation and exploitation of host cell cytoskeleton by periodontal pathogens.
AB  == some periodontal pathogens disrupt epithelial barriers and cellular adhesion to the extracellular matrix, which affects the cytoskeleton. porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans exploit the cytoskeleton during their uptake by epithelial cells. treponema denticola perturbs actin and actin-regulating pathways in host cells. cytoskeletal dysfunction due to pathogenic bacteria may impair physiologic remodeling and wound repair in the periodontium.

TI  == the prevalence of bana-hydrolyzing periodontopathic bacteria in smokers.
AB  == smoking has been identified as a risk factor for development of periodontal disease and a strong indicator for treatment failure in periodontal patients. this study examined 172 patients categorized as current smokers (n=55), previous  smokers (n=38) or individuals that had never smoked (n=79). a total of 670 interproximal plaques collected with a wooden toothpick were analyzed for hydrolysis of the synthetic trypsin substrate benzoyl-dl-arginine naphthylamide (bana). about 95% of the bana hydrolysis by plaque is due to the presence of one  or more of the periodontopathogens, p. gingivalis, t. denticola or b. forsythus.  gingival health was measured using the papillary bleeding score (pbs). current smokers had less gingival bleeding than previous smokers or those who had never smoked (20% versus 41% and 25%, respectively). plaque removed from non-bleeding sites in current smokers were 11x more likely to have a positive bana reaction when compared to plaque removed from non-bleeding sites in individuals who never  smoked. a significant positive relationship exists between smoking and colonization by the bana periodontopathogens. smoking may select for these periodontopathic species in the plaque and may be one reason why smoking is a risk factor in periodontal disease development.

TI  == granulocyte elastase activity and pge2 levels in gingival crevicular fluid in relation to the presence of subgingival periodontopathogens in subjects with untreated adult periodontitis.
AB  == this study aimed to determine the association between the levels of granulocyte elastase and prostaglandin e2 (pge2) in gce and the concomitant presence of periodontopathogens in untreated adult periodontitis (ap). gcf and subgingival plaque were sampled by paper strips and paper points respectively, from various periodontal sites in 16 ap subjects. granulocyte elastase activity in gcf was analyzed with a low molecular weight substrate specific for granulocyte elastase, pgluproval-pna, and the maximal rate of elastase activity (mr-ea, mabs/min/site)  was calculated. pge2 levels in gcf were determined by radioimmunoassay. 5 species-specific dna probes were used to detect the presence of a. actinomyceterncomitans (a.a., atcc 43718), b. forsythus (b.f, atcc 43037), p. gingivalis (p.g., atcc 33277), p. intermedia (p.i., atcc 33563), and t. denticola (t.d., atcc 35405), with a sensitivity of 10(3) cells/paper point. no a.a. was detectable from all sites sampled. the predominant combination of species detected was b.f., p.g., p.i. & t.d. and it was significantly higher at periodontitis sites (68%) than at healthy (7%) or gingivitis sites (29%) (p<0.05). overall, mr-ea values were strongly correlated with pge2 levels (r=0.655, p<0.001), especially at these periodontitis sites co-infected by b.f.,  p.g., p.i. & t.d. (r=0.722, p<0.001). the periodontitis sites co-infected by the  4 species were observable from 15 subjects. these sites were sub-grouped into 8 subjects with a high mr-ea and 7 subjects with a low mr-ea. the pge2 levels in the high mr-ea group were significantly higher than in the low mr-ea group (p<0.05). no significant differences in clinical or bacterial data were found between the two groups. while within the high mr-ea group, similar results were found between the paired periodontitis sites in each subject with highest and lowest mr-ea values. this study shows that the local host response to bacterial challenge in untreated periodontal pockets is diverse in terms of the intensity of inflammatory response measured by granulocyte elastase and pge2 levels in gce  a more thorough evaluation of the risk for active periodontal disease may involve the combined approaches to the test of the dynamic bacteria-host relations.

TI  == inability of intact cells of treponema denticola to degrade human serum proteins  iga, igg and albumin.
AB  == treponema denticola has been shown to be associated with periodontitis in man and animals. the organism ferments amino acids and thrives on the proteins in the periodontal pocket. accordingly, t. denticola possesses various proteolytic enzymes, including a chymotrypsin-like protease, capable of hydrolyzing a whole range of proteins, including immunoglobulins. yet, it is not clear whether the intact cells of t. denticola can degrade immunoglobulins and albumin. the purpose of this study was to clarify this point. three strains of t. denticola were cultured in liquid medium, and cells were harvested by centrifugation. protein degradation in cell suspensions was assayed by capillary electrophoresis and immunonephelometry. none of the t. denticola strains appeared to be able to degrade iga, igg, or albumin, while a strain of p. gingivalis completely hydrolyzed these proteins. the findings suggest that, in the periodontal pocket,  t. denticola depends on proteinases from other bacteria for utilization of the available serum proteins. this is in accordance with clinical data showing a close relationship between t. denticola and strongly proteolytic bacteria, such as porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides forsythus.

TI  == relationship between herpesviruses and adult periodontitis and periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == background: various mammalian viruses and specific bacteria seem to play important roles in the pathogenesis of human periodontitis. this study examined the relationship between subgingival herpesviruses and periodontal disease and potential periodontopathic bacteria in 140 adults exhibiting either periodontitis or gingivitis. methods: a nested-polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method determined the presence of epstein-barr virus type 1 and type 2 (ebv-1, ebv-2), human cytomegalovirus (hcmv), and herpes simplex virus (hsv) and a 16s rrna pcr detection method identified actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens,  and treponema denticola. results: using a logistic analysis, ebv-1 showed significant positive association with p. gingivalis (odds ratio [or] 3.37), and with coinfections of p. gingivalis and p. intermedia (or 4.03); p. gingivalis and b. forsythus (or 3.84); p. gingivalis and t. denticola (or 4.17); p. gingivalis,  b. forsythus, and t. denticola (or 4.06); and p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens, and t. denticola (or 3.29). ebv-1 also showed positive association with severe periodontitis (or 5.09), with increasing age (or 1.03), and with periodontal probing depth at the sample sites (or 1.77). hcmv was positively associated with  coinfections of p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens (or 3.23); p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, and p. nigrescens (or 3.23); and p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens, and t.  denticola (or 2.59); with severe periodontitis (or 4.65); and with age (or 1.03). patients with mixed viral infections revealed significant associations with p. gingivalis (or 2.27), and with coinfections of p. gingivalis and b. forsythus (or 2.06); p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens (or 2.91); p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, and p. nigrescens (or 2.91); and p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens, and t. denticola (or 2.70) with the clinical diagnosis of slight (or 3.73), moderate (or 3.82), or severe periodontitis (or 4.36), and with probing depth at the sample sites (or 1.39). hsv and ebv-2 showed no significant associations with any of the variables tested. conclusions: the results indicate that subgingival ebv-1, hcmv, and viral coinfections are associated with the subgingival presence of some periodontal pathogens and periodontitis. herpesviruses may exert periodontopathic potential by decreasing the host resistance against subgingival colonization and multiplication of periodontal pathogens.

TI  == virulence of a polymicrobic complex, treponema denticola and porphyromonas gingivalis, in a murine model.
AB  == the effect of a polymicrobic infection employing treponema denticola and porphyromonas gingivalis in the murine lesion model was used to determine the synergistic virulence of these two periodontopathic bacteria. at high doses of p. gingivalis w50, addition of t. denticola in the infection mixture had no effect on the formation and size of the spreading lesion caused by this microorganism. however, at low p. gingivalis challenge doses, t. denticola significantly enhanced the virulence of p. gingivalis compared with monoinfection of this microorganism. a potential role of the trypsin-like protease enzyme activity of p. gingivalis in this synergistic virulence was tested using p. gingivalis mutants deficient (i.e., bei) or devoid (i.e., ng4b19) of this protease activity. these findings demonstrated that t. denticola-p. gingivalis complexes exhibit enhanced virulence in this model and that even using a polymicrobic challenge infection, the trypsin-like protease activity was important to p. gingivalis virulence expression.

TI  == local metronidazole application in maintenance patients. clinical and microbiological evaluation.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effect of local antibiotic therapy in comparison with subgingival scaling and root planing in a randomized semi-masked study. forty-six recall patients who completed systematic periodontal therapy 6 to 24 months prior to the study were enrolled. the inclusion requirements were at least one site with probing depth > or = 5 mm in each quadrant, no scaling, and no antibiotic therapy during the last 6 months. after randomization each patient received 2 different treatments: in 2 quadrants metronidazole 25% dental gel was applied subgingivally to the pockets at day 0 and day 7; scaling and root planing was carried out in the 2 other quadrants, one at day 0 and in the remaining quadrant at day 7. subgingival microbiological samples were taken from each patient before treatment and on days 21, 91, and 175 after the treatment. the analyses were carried out by indirect immunofluorescence assay. at all treated sites probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded on days 0, 21, 91, and 175. both treatments resulted in pd reduction and cal gain. pd reduction was statistically significant (p < 0.01) for both treatment modalities after 6 months. the cal gain was not significant for either treatment. there was no statistical significance between scaling and antibiotic therapy. treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia were significantly reduced after therapy; however, there were no statistically significant differences between treatments. if actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was present before therapy, it was also present after treatment in both groups. the conclusion is that, in recall patients, local application of metronidazole and scaling and root planing showed similar clinical and microbiological effects without statistically significant differences.

TI  == risk indicators for harboring periodontal pathogens.
AB  == the risk for harboring 6 putative periodontal pathogens in 4 selected periodontal pockets, in whole saliva, or in either site (i.e., orally) was determined in 52 caucasians, 49 african-americans, 48 asian-americans, and 50 hispanics living in  los angeles. 16s rrna pcr analysis assessed the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and treponema denticola. step-wise  regression analysis determined the relationship between the occurrence of each organism and various explanatory variables (risk indicators). periodontal probing depth or disease severity was positively associated with all 6 study organisms. african-americans carried an increased risk for harboring p. gingivalis in saliva (odds ratio [or] 2.95) and orally (or 2.66), and a reduced risk for harboring t.  denticola orally (or 0.34). asian-americans showed an increased risk for harboring a. actinomycetemcomitans in periodontal pockets (or 6.63) and p. gingivalis in periodontal pockets (or 5.39), in saliva (or 5.74), and orally (or  5.81). hispanics demonstrated an increased risk for harboring a. actinomycetemcomitans in periodontal pockets (or 12.27) and p. gingivalis in periodontal pockets (or 6.07), in saliva (or 8.72), and orally (or 7.98). age was positively associated with the prevalence of p. gingivalis in saliva (or 1.20) and orally (or 1.20), and of a. actinomycetemcomitans orally (or 1.18). the male  gender was a risk factor for harboring p. intermedia in periodontal pockets (or 2.40), in saliva (or 3.31), and orally (or 4.25), and for harboring p. nigrescens in saliva (or 2.85). the longer the subjects resided in the united states, the less likely a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected orally (or 0.82). former smokers demonstrated a decreased risk for harboring a. actinomycetemcomitans in saliva (or 0.23). current smokers displayed an increased risk for harboring t. denticola in periodontal pockets (or 4.61). the number of dental visits in the past 10 years was inversely related to the prevalence of p. intermedia orally (or 0.96). the prevalence of p. intermedia in saliva was positively associated with the length of time from the last dental visit (or 1.01). this study suggests that genetic and/or environmental factors predispose subjects to oral colonization by  putative periodontal pathogens.

TI  == early-onset periodontitis associated with down's syndrome--clinical interventional study.
AB  == individuals with down's syndrome (ds) have an increased prevalence of periodontal disease compared with otherwise normal, age-matched control groups and other mentally handicapped patients of similar age distribution. the exaggerated immune-inflammatory response of the tissues cannot be explained by poor oral hygiene alone and might be the result of an impaired cell-mediated and humoral immunity and a deficient phagocytic system. as far as the progression and severity of destruction, the oral manifestations of ds patients are consistent with the juvenile periodontitis (jp) disease pattern. the purpose of the present  study was 1) to assess the periodontal clinical and microbiological status of 10  ds patients aged 20 to 31 years (mean: 26.3 years) relative to that of 11 patients with cerebral palsy (cp) aged 23 to 53 years (mean: 36 years) without defective immunological functions, and 2) to determine the effect of supragingival plaque control and oral hygiene instruction in these patient groups. subsequent to the initial examination and a professional tooth cleaning program, clinical and microbiological parameters were monitored over a period of  12 weeks. the clinical examination included the recording of plaque index (p1), gingival index (gi), probing depth (pd), and clinical attachment level (cal). subgingival plaque samples were always obtained from the same pocket with the highest disease activity (deepest bleeding site at baseline examination) in each  subject for a morphotype analysis by dark field microscopy and for identification and quantitation of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, eikenella corrodens, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, and campylobacter rectus by dna probes. the results of the baseline examinations demonstrated that ds patients and patients with cerebral palsy had inflamed gingiva associated with a high amount of plaque. the mean probing depth and percentage of sites with probing depth> 4 mm corresponded to age and poor oral hygiene in cp patients. deep pockets in ds patients demonstrated a high prevalence of periodontal disease compared with age-matched children with mental retardation and non-handicapped patients. regarding the young age of onset, the severe destruction of periodontal tissues and pathogenesis of periodontitis in ds patients are consistent with the  juvenile periodontitis disease pattern. the missing clinical benefit and alteration of the subgingival flora following supragingival plaque control in ds  patients underlined the alteration in the immunological response.

TI  == potential pathogenic mechanisms of periodontitis associated pregnancy complications.
AB  == during normal pregnancy, maternal hormones and locally acting cytokines play a key role in regulating the onset of labor, cervical ripening, uterine contraction, and delivery. maternal infections during pregnancy have been demonstrated to perturb this normal cytokine and hormone-regulated gestation, sometimes resulting in preterm labor, preterm premature rupture of membranes, and preterm low birth weight (plbw), i.e., < 2,500 g and < 37 weeks of gestation. our research focus has been to determine whether periodontal infections can provide sufficient challenge to the mother to trigger plbw. new experiments from 48 case-control subjects have measured gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) levels of pge(2) and il-1-beta to determine whether mediator levels were related to current pregnancy outcome. in addition, the levels of 4 periodontal pathogens were measured by using microbe-specific dna probes. results indicate that gcf-pge(2) levels are significantly higher in plbw mothers, as compared with normal birth weight (nbw) controls (131.4 +/- 21.8 vs. 62.6 +/- 10.3 [mean +/- se ng/ml], respectively, at p = 0.02). furthermore, within primiparous plbw mothers, there was a significant inverse association between birth weight (as well as gestational age) and gcf-pge(2) levels at p = 0.023. these data suggest a dose-response relationship for increasing gcf-pge(2) as a marker of current periodontal disease activity and decreasing birth weight. microbial data indicate that 4 organisms associated with mature plaque and progressing periodontitis--bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and treponema denticola--were detected at higher levels in plbw mothers, as compared to nbw controls. these data suggest that biochemical measures of maternal periodontal status and oral microbial burden are associated  with current plbw.

TI  == crevicular fluid level of beta-glucuronidase in relation to clinical periodontal  parameters and putative periodontal pathogens in early-onset periodontitis.
AB  == analysis of beta-glucuronidase (betag) in the gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) provides an indication of neutrophil influx into the crevicular environment. the  aim of this study was to test the hypotheses that: (1) betag is significantly elevated in individuals with early-onset periodontitis (eop) and that betag activity correlates with disease severity; and (2) betag level may reflect the local bacterial challenge in the gingival crevice. the study subjects consisted of a sub-sample of individuals examined in the national survey of oral health of  united states children, which was undertaken during the 1986/87 school year. a total of 249 individuals were selected based on presence or absence of clinical attachment loss at baseline. the individuals were examined a second time 6 years  later and the clinical attachment loss was assessed, and subgingival plaque and gcf were collected. the subjects were classified into 3 types of eop and a control group. betag activity in the gcf and the levels of 7 putative micro-organisms in the pocket were assessed. the generalized eop group had the highest betag activity, followed by the localized and incidental eop groups, and  the controls, respectively. there was a significant increase in betag activity with the increase in probing depth. also, sites with bleeding on probing had a significantly higher betag activity than sites without bleeding. however, the effect of gingival inflammation on betag activity was more evident in the generalized and localized eop groups. sites harboring high levels of one or more  of the micro-organisms tended to have high betag activity. there were moderate differences between the organisms with respect to their effect on betag activity, but sites with high numbers of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, or treponema denticola also had the highest betag activity. the present findings  suggest that betag activity in gcf from patients with eop can be of value in the  early identification of individuals at higher risk of developing eop the findings also suggest that host mechanisms leading to higher betag activity in eop represent systemic responses and are only partly related to the presence of local factors at the site-level.

TI  == the utility of whole saliva to detect the oral presence of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == this study compared the presence of 6 periodontopathic bacteria in whole saliva and subgingival plaque of 202 subjects. the test bacteria were identified using a 16s rrna-based pcr detection method. each study subject contributed a whole saliva sample and a paper point sample pooled from the deepest periodontal pocket in each quadrant of the dentition. the kappa test revealed a fair agreement between the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and treponema denticola in whole saliva and periodontal pocket samples (kappa > 0.4). the mcnemar test showed that the differences between sample types were due to a more frequent detection of the 3 organisms in whole saliva than in periodontal pocket samples (p < 0.01). prevotella nigrescens also was detected more frequently in whole saliva than in periodontal pocket samples (p < 0.01; mcnemar  test). although little agreement between samples was found for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus (kappa < or = 0.4), neither whole saliva nor pocket samples showed better detection for these 2 species (p < 0.01,  mcnemar test). the results indicate that whole saliva is superior to pooled periodontal pocket samples to detect p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, and t. denticola in the oral cavity. the detection of oral a. actinomycetemcomitans and b. forsythus with reasonably good accuracy may require  both whole saliva and periodontal pocket samples.

TI  == dentilisin activity affects the organization of the outer sheath of treponema denticola.
AB  == prolyl-phenylalanine-specific serine protease (dentilisin) is a major extracellular protease produced by treponema denticola. the gene, prtp, coding for the protease was recently cloned and sequenced (k. ishihara, t. miura, h. k.  kuramitsu, and k. okuda, infect. immun. 64:5178-5186, 1996). in order to determine the role of this protease in the physiology and virulence of t. denticola, a dentilisin-deficient mutant, k1, was constructed following electroporation with a prtp-inactivated dna fragment. no chymotrypsin-like protease activity was detected in the dentilisin-deficient mutant. in addition, the high-molecular-mass oligomeric protein characteristic of the outer sheath of  the organism decreased in the mutant. furthermore, the hydrophobicity of the mutant was decreased, and coaggregation of the mutant with fusobacterium nucleatum was enhanced compared to that of the wild-type organism. the results obtained with a mouse abscess model system indicated that the virulence of the mutant was attenuated relative to that of the wild-type organism. these results suggest that dentilisin activity plays a major role in the structural organization of the outer sheath of t. denticola. the loss of dentilsin activity  and the structural change in the outer sheath affect the pathogenicity of t. denticola.

AB  == this investigation compared the site prevalence of 40 subgingival species in 30 periodontally healthy (mean age 36+/-9 years), 35 elders with a well-maintained periodontium (mean age 77+/-5) and 138 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 46+/-11). subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth (up to 28 samples) in the 203 subjects at baseline. the presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 5003 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level, were made at 6 sites per tooth. the % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject. differences in prevalence and levels among groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis test. commonly detected species, such as actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus oralis did not differ significantly among subject groups. after adjusting for multiple comparisons, 4 species were significantly elevated and at greater prevalence in the periodontitis group. mean % of sites (+/-sem) colonized by bacteroides forsythus was 10+/-3, 12+/-2 and 40+/-2 (p<0.001) for healthy, elder and periodontitis groups respectively. the odds ratio was 14.4:1 that a subject had periodontitis when b. forsythus was detected at > or = 5% of sampled sites. mean prevalence for porphyromonas gingivalis in healthy, elder and periodontitis subjects was 4+/-2, 5+/-2 and 23+/-2 respectively (p<0.001); for treponema denticola 12+/-4, 10+/-3 and 30+/-2  (p<0.001) and for selenomonas noxia 6+/-2, 7+/-2 and 19+/-2 (p<0.01). similar differences among subject groups were observed when only sites with pd 0-4 mm were analyzed. the data suggest an etiologic role for b. forsythus, p. gingivalis, t. denticola and s. noxia in adult periodontitis.

TI  == association of oral spirochetes from periodontally healthy sites with development of gingivitis.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to determine whether the presence of selected disease-associated bacteria in health-associated plaque correlated with  future gingivitis. sites of periodontal health were identified in 65 adults. six  months later (recall 1) plaque was collected from sites that remained in periodontal health, and 5 species of specific bacteria and pathogen-related oral  spirochetes were detected using monoclonal antibodies in a microscopic assay. members of the spirochete morphogroup were also identified by phase contrast microscopy. the relationship between site-specific detection of bacteria at recall 1 and development of gingivitis at recall 2 or 3 was evaluated by means of logistic regression using generalized estimating equations, from which odds ratios (or) were estimated. significance was conservatively defined as or > 2.0 and p < 0.05. we found that 488 of 1,424 healthy sites developed gingivitis over  the 12-month interval between recall 1 and 3. only the spirochete morphogroup (or =2.04; p=0.002) was significantly associated with the transition from health to gingivitis. the association of treponema socranskii with future gingivitis was higher than expected (or=2.27), but the relationship was not statistically significant (p=0.163). campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, and pathogen-related oral spirochetes did not correlate well with gingivitis (or < 2.0). health-associated plaque from 5 sites contained treponema  denticola, and all 5 sites progressed to gingivitis. an or could not be calculated because t. denticola was not detected in health-associated plaque from stable healthy sites. these findings indicated that the presence of t. denticola  and unidentified spirochetes in health-associated plaque was associated with increased susceptibility to gingival inflammation. future studies assessing a larger panel of dental plaque microorganisms, with shorter intervals between baseline and follow-up assessment, are necessary to more fully evaluate the association between detection of specific organisms at healthy sites and risk for gingivitis.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

TI  == clinical and microbiological features of refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the clinical parameters and the  site prevalence and levels of 40 subgingival species in successfully treated and  refractory periodontitis subjects. 94 subjects received scaling and root planing  and if needed, periodontal surgery and systemically administered tetracycline. 28 refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or > 3 sites showing attachment loss > 2.5 mm within 1 year post-therapy. 66 successfully treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss > 2.5 mm. baseline subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the mean levels and % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject and differences between groups sought using the mann-whitney test. most of the 40 species tested, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus, were equally or less prevalent in the refractory group. prevotella nigrescens was significantly more prevalent in successfully treated subjects, while refractory subjects harbored a larger proportion of streptococcus species, particularly streptococcus constellatus. the odds of a subject being refractory was 8.6 (p < 0.001) if s. constellatus constituted > or = 3.5% of the  total dna probe count. since few microbiological differences existed between treatment outcome groups using dna probes to known species, the predominant cultivable microbiota of 33 subgingival samples from 14 refractory subjects was examined. 85% of the 1649 isolates were identified using probes to 69 recognized  subgingival species. the remaining unidentified strains were classified by analyzing 16s rrna gene sequences. many sequenced isolates were of taxa not considered a common part of the oral microbiota such as acinetobacter baumanni, gemella haemolysans, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus warneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa and novel species in the genera bartonella, ralstonia, neisseria, eubacterium, rothia, gordona, gemella, corynebacterium, leptotrichia, and actinomyces. refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based on their subgingival microbiota. as a group, they did not harbor more of the "classic" periodontopathogens, although elevated proportions of s. constellatus were found.

TI  == association of oral spirochetes from sites of periodontal health with development of periodontitis.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to determine whether the presence of disease-associated bacteria in health-associated plaque correlated with susceptibility to periodontitis over time. sites of periodontal health were identified in 65 adults. six months later (recall 1), plaque was collected from sites that remained in periodontal health, and specific bacteria were detected using monoclonal antibodies in a microscopic assay. the spirochete morphogroup was identified by phase contrast microscopy. the relationship between detection at recall 1 and development of periodontitis over two successive 6-month intervals (recalls 2 and 3) was evaluated by means of logistic regression using generalized estimating equations (gee), from which odds ratios (or) were estimated and tested for significance. significant relationships were defined as  those having ors with p < 0.05. ninety-three of 1,032 sites developed signs of early periodontitis over the 12-month interval between recall 1 and recall 3. the spirochete morphogroup (or = 3.13, p < 0.001) and pathogen-related oral spirochetes (pros) (or = 3.68, p < 0.001) were significantly associated with healthy sites that developed periodontitis. the association of treponema socranskii was not significant (or = 3.62, p = 0.0918). odds ratios for campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, and porphyromonas gingivalis were less than 2.0 and not significant. treponema denticola was not detected in health-associated plaque from stable health sites and was detected in only three  sites that progressed to periodontitis. these findings indicate that the presence of pros and some unidentified spirochetes in health-associated plaque is associated with increased susceptibility to periodontitis.

TI  == oral food consumption and subgingival microorganisms: subgingival microbiota of gastrostomy tube-fed children and healthy controls.
AB  == this study examined the effect of oral food consumption on the prevalence and levels of subgingival bacteria and yeasts in 20 gastrostomy tube-fed children and 24 healthy controls. microbial identification was carried out using anaerobic culture and 16s rrna-based pcr identification methods. streptococcal and actinomyces species were recovered from 100% and 76% of all subjects and averaged 66% and 11% of total cultivable organisms, respectively. in decreasing order of prevalence, fusobacterium, enteric rods, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga, propionibacterium, yeasts, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, and porphyromonas gingivalis were detected in 48% to 2% of the study subjects. the cultivable levels of these species varied widely among subjects. pcr detection showed c. rectus and eikenella corrodens both to occur in 93% of the study subjects and to be the most prevalent putative periodontal pathogens examined. in decreasing order of prevalence, pcr identified treponema denticola, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. nigrescens, p. intermedia, b. forsythus,  and p. gingivalis in 38% to 21% of the subjects studied. tube-fed children and healthy controls exhibited similar subgingival microbial compositions. it appears from this study that oral food consumption is not a major determinant for the establishment of subgingival microbiota in children.

TI  == putative periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque of young adults with and without early-onset periodontitis.
AB  == this study assessed the associations between putative periodontal pathogens and early-onset periodontitis (eop) in a population of 248 subjects, 13 to 19 years of age at baseline, derived from a representative sample of u.s. young adults. the subjects were selected based on the presence or absence of attachment loss at baseline. the attachment level was assessed clinically at baseline and at a 6-year follow-up examination, and the presence of 7 bacterial species was assessed at follow-up using dna probes. the individuals were classified into generalized, localized, incidental eop, and no-periodontitis groups based on the  extent and severity of attachment loss; and classified as having rapid, moderate, slow, and no progression based on the rate of periodontal progression during the  6 preceding years. in the eop groups there were significantly higher percentages  of individuals with detectable levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, and treponema denticola. in addition, the eop group had significantly higher levels of these 5  microorganisms compared to the no-periodontitis group. there were also higher percentages of individuals with these species and higher levels of bacteria in the group showing disease progression than the group without progression. in a descending order of importance, p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and p. intermedia were the microorganisms significantly associated with the generalized and/or rapidly progressing disease. f. nucleatum and c. rectus were also associated with eop, but to a lesser degree. in the present population actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was not significantly associated with eop, though it was recovered more often from subjects with localized eop. eikenella corrodens was present equally in subjects with and without disease. the results show that several bacterial species are associated with eop, and that p. gingivalis and t.  denticola are of particular importance and may play a significant role in the more severe and progressive forms of eop.

TI  == clinical and microbiological features of subjects with adult periodontitis who responded poorly to scaling and root planing.
AB  == in a previous report, it was shown that scaling and root planing (srp) decreased  mean pocket depth and attachment level in subjects with adult periodontitis, as well as the levels and prevalence of bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. however, a subset of subjects in that study exhibited mean loss of attachment following srp. the purpose of the present investigation was to seek clinical and microbiological differences between subjects who responded well or poorly to srp. 57 subjects with adult periodontitis were treated by full-mouth srp under local anaesthetic. clinical assessments of plaque, redness, suppuration, bop, pocket depth and attachment level were made at 6 sites per tooth prior to and 3 months post-srp. attachment level measurements were repeated at each visit and differences in means between visits used to assess change. 18 subjects showed mean attachment loss 3 months post-srp (poor response group), while 39 showed mean attachment level gain (good  response group). the prevalence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa in subgingival  plaque samples from the mesiobuccal site of each tooth (maximum 28 sites) in each subject prior to and 3 months post-srp were assessed using checker-board dna-dna  hybridization. the prevalence of each species was computed for each subject and averaged across subjects in the 2 treatment-response groups at each visit. differences between groups were sought using the mann-whitney test. there were no statistically significant differences between the 2 response groups in any clinical parameter prior to therapy. subjects in the good response group showed more attachment level gain at sites with baseline pocket depths of < 4 mm, 4-6 and > 6 mm than poor response subjects. of 40 species evaluated, a. naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus), t. denticola, c. gracilis and c. rectus were significantly higher and more prevalent pre-therapy in the good response subjects. mean attachment level change post srp could be predicted using multiple linear regression with a. naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) and t. denticola as the predictor variables (r2 = 0.373, p < 0.00001). sites that gained > or = 2  mm of attachment post therapy showed a significant decrease in the counts of p. gingivalis (7.5 +/- 3.5 to 0.2 +/- 0.2 x 10(5)), t. denticola (8.2 +/- 3.5 to 1.8 +/- 1.1 x 10(5)) and b. forsythus (11.1 +/- 5.7 to 0.3 +/- 0.2 x 10(5)). the data of the present investigation indicate that srp is most effective in subjects and  sites with high levels of the subgingival species that this therapy affects.

TI  == the optimization of the bana test as a screening instrument for gingivitis among  subjects seeking dental treatment.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus have been implicated in periodontal disease and each possesses an enzyme capable of hydrolyzing the synthetic trypsin substrate, bana. we have used a chairside test  for bana hydrolysis to diagnose an anaerobic periodontal infection in patients with advanced forms of clinical disease using a 15-min/55 degrees c incubation protocol. however, the bana test performance is dependent upon the length and temperature of incubation. in the present study, we have evaluated a 5-min/35 degrees c, a 5-min/55 degrees c and a 15-min/55 degrees c incubation protocol to  determine whether the performance of the bana test could be optimized using plaque samples obtained from subjects seeking dental treatment. logistic regression models were tested with age, smoking status, and gingivitis scores as  covariates. the best fitting model obtained with the 5-min/35 degrees c protocol  had a sensitivity of 71%, a specificity of 68%, a false-positive proportion of 9%, a false-negative proportion of 65%, and an overall accuracy of 80%. when maximum likelihood estimates were obtained in this model, plaques from individuals who reported that they currently smoked were 9.57x, and those who quit smoking were 4.73x more likely to have a positive bana score than someone who never smoked. plaques were 4.55x more likely to be bana-positive if they were removed from sites with gingivitis. these findings indicate that the performance  of the bana test is best using the 5-min/35 degrees c incubation protocol.

TI  == characterization of protease activities in capnocytophaga spp., porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema denticola and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == protease activities in cell sonicates of defined bacterial strains were examined  using peptide substrates and class-specific inhibitors. capnocytophaga spp. all produced serine dipeptidyl peptidase activity and arginine/lysine, elastase- and  chymotrypsin-like enzymes with some metalloprotease characteristics. the elastase-like activity was strongest in capnocytophaga sputigena, but the others  were greatest in capnocytophaga gingivalis. the latter also had a separate arginine-specific enzyme which appeared not to be present in the other two species. porphyromonas gingivalis showed serine dipeptidyl peptidase activity and very strong arginine and lysine cysteine protease activities. prevotella spp. had inhibitor-resistant dipeptidyl peptidase activity and arginine cysteine protease  activity that was much weaker but biochemically similar to p. gingivalis. treponema denticola possessed a strong trypsin-like serine protease activity as well as very weak dipeptidyl peptidase and chymotrypsin-like activities that were sensitive to some cysteine protease reagents. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans showed a novel alanine- and lysine-specific activity, but its nature was unclear.

TI  == assessment of pretreatment orthodontic patients using the bana test. n-benzoyl-dl-arginine-naphthylamide.
AB  == ninety-two subjects were tested before orthodontic mechanotherapy for the presence of three putative periodontopathogens-porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and bacteroides forsythus-with the bana test (perioscan oral-b). the sample ranged from 9 to 16 years, with a mean age of 13.1 years, and consisted of 51% girls and 49% boys; 48% african american, 46% white, 4% asian, and 2% hispanic. unlike other bana studies that examined children and adolescents with a 15-minute incubation time, this research used a 5-minute incubation time to increase the specificity and to reduce the false positives obtained from the perioscan cards. no statistically significant difference was found between the age, gender, or race of the patients and the levels of the three putative periodontopathogens. a friedman two-way analysis of variance assessed the bana levels for three groups of teeth: molars, incisors, and premolars. the central incisors and first molars had a significantly higher percentage of positive bana  readings than the first premolars at p < or = 0.05. the clinical importance of this finding has yet to be determined, however, because the central incisor and first molar are the first permanent teeth to erupt, a possible association between dental emergence time and the rate of infection with various organisms may be postulated. in a pilot study, 10 patients from a statistically comparable  pretreatment group were assessed longitudinally at two separate collection times  separated by 4 months. the wilcoxon signed rank test indicated no significant changes in these patients over the 4-month period.

TI  == subgingival microbiota in adult chinese: prevalence and relation to periodontal disease progression.
AB  == the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technology was used to study the epidemiology of 18 microbial species associated with various states of periodontal health and disease, in a sample of 148 chinese subjects never exposed to systematic dental therapeutic intervention, aged 30 to 39 and 50 to 59 years.  our aims were to: 1) describe the prevalence of these microorganisms; 2) correlate the microbiological and clinical profiles of the subjects; and 3) examine the association between the microbiological variables and the longitudinal changes of periodontal status that occurred over a preceding 10-year period. a maximum of 14 subgingival samples were obtained from each subject-1,864 in all. the frequency of occurrence of the 18 species examined was high in this chinese population, on both the subject and the tooth site level. however, all species were not found equally capable of reaching high numbers in the subgingival samples and, as a rule, colonized heavily only limited proportions of tooth sites within each mouth. there was a profound increase of certain species such as porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and bacteroides forsythus  in deep pockets or progressing sites. multivariate techniques using the subgingival profile could effectively discriminate between deep/shallow pockets and progressing/ stable tooth sites. the microbiological variables showed an enhanced discriminating potential when classifications were performed on the individual subject level. colonization by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, campylobacter rectus, and t. denticola at levels exceeding certain thresholds entailed a significantly increased probability (odds ratios > 4) for an individual subject to harbor deep pockets or progressing tooth sites.

TI  == the relationship between gingivitis and the serum antibodies to the microbiota associated with periodontal disease in children with down's syndrome.
AB  == gingival inflammation in down's syndrome children (ds) develops earlier and is more rapid and extensive than in non-ds children. abnormalities in host response  to the oral flora have been proposed as etiological factors of this gingival inflammation. however, the relationship between gingivitis and the host response  to oral microorganisms in ds by age has not been determined. the objective of this study was to clarify this relationship. sera were obtained from 75 ds subjects (aged 2 to 18 years) and their gingival health assessed using a modified pma index (m-pma). antibody titers to porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), treponema denticola (td), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), selenomonas sputigena (sel), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), and streptococcus mitis (mi) were determined using the micro-elisa. ds subjects under 4 years old were found to have significantly more gingival inflammation than did  normal children the same age. a significant positive correlation (r = 0.548, p <  0.0001) existed in the relationship between m-pma score and plaque score for subjects in the g1 age group (deciduous dentition). at g1, the average antibody titers to aa, mi, and fn exceeded those of the normal adult reference serum pool. in addition, igg antibody titers to pg, aa, fn, sel, and mi correlated significantly with the m-pma scores in the g1 age group. there was a correlation  between age (2 to 18 years) and these antibody titers. igg antibody titers to pg, aa, sel, and mi increased significantly with increasing m-pma score. furthermore, the igg antibody titers to pg were higher (p < 0.05) in the most extensive disease group compared to the ds no-disease group. the igg antibody titers to pg  at g3 (early puberty) were significantly higher when compared to g1 (preschool children). the igm antibody titers to aa at g3 were higher (p < 0.05) when compared to g1. this study suggests that colonization by aa and fn are closely associated with the onset of gingival inflammation in ds patients under 5 years old. colonization by pg, aa, sel, and mi in ds appears to be associated with gingivitis at puberty.

TI  == the effect of srp on the clinical and microbiological parameters of periodontal diseases.
AB  == the purpose of the present investigation was to examine the effect of srp on clinical and microbiological parameters in 57 subjects with adult periodontitis (mean age 47 +/- 11 years). subjects were monitored clinically and microbiologically prior to and 3, 6 and 9 months after full-mouth srp under local anaesthesia. clinical assessments of plaque, redness, suppuration, bop, pocket depth and attachment level were made at 6 sites per tooth. the means of duplicate attachment level measurements taken at each visit were used to assess change between visits. clinical data were averaged within each subject and then averaged across subjects for each visit. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the mean levels and % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject at each visit. differences in clinical and microbiological parameters before and after srp were sought using the wilcoxon signed ranks test or the quade test for more than 2 visits. overall, there was a mean gain in attachment level of 0.11 +/- 0.23 mm (range -0.53 to 0.64 mm) 3 months post-therapy. there was a significant decrease in the % of sites exhibiting gingival redness (68 to 57%) and bop (58 to 52%) as well as a mean (+/-sem) pocket depth (3.3 +/- 0.06 to 3.1 +/- 0.05 mm). sites with pre-therapy pocket depths of < 4 mm showed a non-significant increase in pocket depth and attachment level, 4.6 mm pockets showed a significant decrease in pocket depth and a non-significant gain in attachment post-therapy, while > 6 mm  pockets showed a significant decrease in pocket depth and attachment level measurements post-therapy. significant clinical improvements were seen in subjects who had never smoked or were past smokers but not in current smokers. mean prevalences and levels of p. gingivalis, t. denticola and b. forsythus were  significantly reduced after srp, while a. viscosus showed a significant increase  in mean levels. the mean decrease in prevalence of p. gingivalis was similar at all pocket depth categories, while b. forsythus decreased more at shallow and intermediate pockets and a. viscosus increased most at deep sites. p. gingivalis. b. forsythus and t. denticola were equally prevalent among current, past and never smokers pre-therapy, decreased significantly post-srp in never and past smokers but increased in current smokers. clinical improvement post-srp was accompanied by a modest change in the subgingival microbiota, primarily a reduction in p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and t. denticola, suggesting potential targets for therapy and indicating that radical alterations in the subgingival microbiota may not be necessary or desirable in many patients.

TI  == in vitro models that support adhesion specificity in biofilms of oral bacteria.
AB  == adhesion to adsorbed pellicles and interspecies co-adhesion to form plaque biofilms involve selective interactions of bacterial adhesins with specific receptors. our laboratory has devised in vitro assays for co-adhesion between actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus oralis or porphyromonas gingivalis on saliva-coated mineral and hexadecane droplet substrata. p. gingivalis structures  significant for co-adhesion with a. naeslundii include surface vesicles and fimbriae. a family of arginine-specific cysteine proteinases in vesicles may be involved in adherence to bacteria, to host cells, and to matrix proteins. new research from several laboratories has found that such proteinases are processed  from genes encoding polyproteins containing both proteinase and hemagglutinin domains. in addition to enzyme-substrate recognition, bacterial adhesion is often determined by specific protein-peptide and lectincarbohydrate recognition. a. naeslundii--salivary prolinerich protein, s. gordonii--salivary alpha-amylase, and treponema denticola--matrix protein recognition are examples of the former. co-adhesion of a. naeslundii and s. oralis is an example of the latter. lactose can selectively desorb a. naeslundii cells from mixed biofilms with s. oralis, a  demonstration of the significance of specificity. although non-specific forces are probably secondary to stereochemical fit in determining the selective range of surfaces that bacteria have evolved to recognize and bind, they probably help  stabilize non-covalent bonds within aligned, complementary domains.

TI  == release and activation of human neutrophil matrix metallo- and serine proteinases during phagocytosis of fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola.
AB  == the phagocytic ingestion of reference strains and clinical isolates of fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns) and the concomitant release of pmn granule proteinases were studied by specific functional and immunological assays. pmns were incubated with the microorganisms anaerobically at 37 degrees c for indicated time periods. the suspensions and pellets were used for phagocytic ingestion assay and electron microscopic study, respectively. the supernatants were used for the measurements of the amounts and activities of the released pmn  enzymes including pmn gelatinase (mmp-9), collagenase (mmp-8), serine proteases (elastase and cathepsin g), and lactate dehydrogenase (ldh). both fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy showed that f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and t. denticola were ingested by the pmns in comparable numbers. however, measurements of the enzymes released from the triggered pmns revealed major differences among the three species. high amount of elastase was released from the pmns triggered by f. nucleatum, but not by p. gingivalis or t. denticola. the treatment of pmns with p. gingivalis whole cells resulted in the release of gelatinase partly in the 82 kd active form, suggesting proteolytic activation of the degranulated 92 kd prommp-9. the 82 kd active form of gelatinase was not detected upon triggering the pmns with f. nucleatum and t. denticola. the pmn-bacteria interaction did not result in release of ldh from triggered pmns indicating the proteinase release was not due to the pmn cell death. the results show that the susceptibilities of the 3 potentially periodontopathogenic microorganisms, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and t. denticola to phagocytic ingestion are not directly related to the amounts and activities of pmn enzymes released during the bacteria-pmn interactions. as pmn degranulation is considered as one of the major pathogenic mechanisms in periodontitis, the observed differences among the microorganisms may be important virulence characteristics of these species.

AB  == microbial colonization of barrier materials used in guided tissue regeneration (gtr) is known to adversely affect treatment outcomes. the purpose of this study  was to compare the rate at which 11 commonly-occurring oral bacteria species colonize three different barrier materials (collagen, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, and polylactic acid). the study group consisted of 10 systemically healthy individuals with no history of periodontal disease and absence of antimicrobial therapy within the previous 3 months. in each patient, 4 teeth per quadrant (p1, p2, m1, m2) were selected and 3 teeth were randomly assigned as test teeth while the remaining tooth acted as a control site (i.e., natural colonization of the tooth surface). these teeth were then randomly assigned to receive one of the three barrier types (i.e., each patient received 4 barriers of each type, 1 per quadrant). a 2 x 5 mm piece of barrier material was  positioned over the oral surface of the buccal marginal gingiva and secured with  an external sling suture. with oral hygiene procedures suspended, one barrier of  each type was collected at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. slot immunoblot assay demonstrated that all species types (a. actinomycetemcomitans, a. viscosus, b. melaninogenicus, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, s. mutans, s. sanguis, selenomonas sputigena, t. denticola, and t. vincentii) were present. semi-quantitative scoring (scale 0 to 3) of slot blot results and analysis by chi-square ratio and pearson correlation test indicated that while total bacteria adherence increased over time (p < 0.05), the 3 barrier types and the control sites did not differ in numbers or species of colonizing bacteria detected per time point. these results suggest that under these experimental conditions the barrier materials tested do not differ in bacteria adherence or antimicrobial properties.

TI  == similarities of periodontal clinical and microbiological parameters in mother-child pairs.
AB  == the aim of this study was to verify the association between children and their mothers (n = 28) for periodontal clinical and microbiological measures. periodontal clinical parameters (probing depth and bleeding on probing) were obtained from six reference teeth from each mother-child pair. in addition, subgingival plaque samples taken from the same reference teeth were collected and placed on the perioscan test for the detection of treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides forsythus. there were statistically significant differences between children and mothers regarding probing depth; there was an overall tendency for mothers to exhibit average probing depths greater than their children. in contrast, if a child had a bleeding site, the respective site on the mother usually also bled on probing, implying that there was an association in terms of bleeding between the mother-child pairs. similar findings were observed for the perioscan test. it is concluded that the occurrence of bleeding and periodontal anaerobic infections (as determined by the perioscan test) were similar in reference teeth of mother-child pairs. these data suggest that parents with periodontal disease may serve as a reservoir of periodontopathic organisms for their children.

TI  == occurrence of porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, and treponema denticola in periodontally healthy and diseased subjects as determined by an elisa technique.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess by means of an elisa technique, the occurrence of 3 putative periodontopathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, and treponema denticola, in 3 clinically-defined adult periodontal conditions. thirty systemically-healthy subjects were selected and grouped into 3 categories according to their periodontal health: 1) 10 periodontitis subjects (ps), having moderate adult chronic periodontitis; 2) 10 untreated gingivitis subjects (ugs), exhibiting no signs of periodontal destruction but presenting with clinical signs of mild gingivitis; and, 3) 10 treated gingivitis subjects (tgs), having the same clinical status as ugs, but who received a thorough prophylaxis treatment within the past 7 to 14 days prior  to the baseline examination. a total of 60 samples were collected subgingivally from the six ramfjord teeth per subject in each group and elisa analysis was carried out to give a semiquantitative estimate of p. gingivalis. b. forsythus, and t. denticola. the immunologic detection method suggested the presence of antigens of p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, and t. denticola in subjects from each of the 3 groups. when a global analysis for the 3 disease groups was performed at one time, statistically significant differences were found among the elisa scores of the 3 bacterial species. for example, comparisons of the elisa scores showed that the concentrations of p. gingivalis differed significantly when comparing tgs to ugs and ps, but not when examining ugs/ps. the elisa scores for b. forsythus were significantly different between tgs and ps. mean concentrations of t. denticola were significantly different when comparing ps to tgs or ugs, whereas no difference was found between the latter categories. within the limited scope of this study, the concentration of antigens detectable from putative periodontopathogens like p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, and t. denticola differed among the 3 diseased groups, with periodontitis subjects often showing the greatest level of antigens. thus, it is reasonable to expect that, when using sensitive immunological detection methods, antigens of suspected periodontal pathogens can be found irrespective of the individual's clinical status. however, while detectable in the periodontal sites, the concentrations of these microorganisms are most likely to be above the threshold necessary to induce clinically-significant disease. studies with larger sample size and standardized  antigens are necessary to determine if the groups we found not to differ, were, in fact, different.

TI  == bodipy-alpha-casein, a ph-independent protein substrate for protease assays using fluorescence polarization.
AB  == bodipy-alpha-casein is a new fluorescent protein substrate designed for fluorescence polarization studies to measure proteolytic activity at any ph over  the range from ph 2 to 11. kinetic protease assays in real-time were performed in 1 to 5 min using an fpm-1 fluorescence polarization instrument. a purified enzyme or bacterial culture was mixed with the bodipy-alpha-casein in a buffer of an appropriate ph and the decrease in fluorescence polarization was automatically recorded at 0.5-min intervals. the initial decrease in fluorescence polarization  with time was dependent on protease concentration. in 3-min assays at 37 degrees  c, the sensitivity of detection was 8 mu for pepsin at ph 2.0, 1 mu for papain at ph 6.0, 0.6 mu for proteinase k at ph 7.4, and 2 mu for streptomyces griseus alkaline protease at ph 11. only 1-10 microliters of a growing culture was necessary to assay the protease activity of porphyromonas gingivalis or treponema denticola, oral bacteria that possess certain proteases on their surfaces. these  assays have clinical applications, since certain pathogens use proteolytic activity as a virulence mechanism and differ from their nonpathogenic counterparts in this characteristic. fluorescence polarization assays are simple, rapid, and reproducible.

TI  == relationship between peptidase activity from treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, and bacteroides forsythus and attachment loss.
AB  == as a diagnostic test, "periocheck" can detect the n-carbobenzoxyglycyl-glycy-arginyl peptidase that is produced by treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, and bacteroides forsythus. the aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between peptidase activity and attachment loss. after phase 1 and surgical therapy, a total of 111 sites from 47 adult periodontitis patients were divided into four groups according to peptidase activity (trypsin unit, tu): a, < 0.1 tu; b, 0.1-0.2 tu; c and d > or = 0.2 tu. all sites in groups a, b, and c were untreated, whereas both subgingival 3% hydrogen peroxide irrigation and 2% minocycline application were undertaken every 45 days throughout the experiment in group d. all subjects were recalled at 3-month intervals. peptidase activity and clinical assessments were measured for  the 18-month period. significant attachment loss associated with high values of the peptidase activity was found through the experimental period in groups b and  c. in contrast, no obvious change of attachment loss was found in groups a and d  following low peptidase activity at 6, 12, and 18 months. the mean attachment loss throughout the 18-month period was 0.22 mm in group a, 1.04 mm in group b, 1.53 mm in group c, and -0.35 mm in group d. probing depth and percentages of bleeding on probing significantly increased in group c, whereas they decreased in group d. this peptidase test displayed a 77.8% sensitivity and 68.6% specificity  regarding the detection of > or = 1 mm attachment loss with a cut-off value of 0.1 tu. multiple linear regression analysis showed a close relationship between peptidase activity and predictable attachment loss within a 12-month period. these findings suggest that this peptidase test is useful in identifying the risk sites for predictable attachment loss.

TI  == selling biotechnology in the dental medicine marketplace: the omnigene diagnostics dna probe tests for periodontal pathogens.
AB  == omnigene diagnostics, inc. has applied the principles of genetic engineering to develop species-specific dna probe tests for eight periodontal pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetem-comitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, and treponema denticola). the test requires minimal effort on the part of the clinician: subgingival plaque samples  are collected from the patient and sent through the mail for analysis by omnigene diagnostics' fully licensed clinical reference laboratory. results are transmitted to the practitioner by phone, fax, or mail. the use of diagnostic tests for periodontal pathogens is a relatively new concept in dentistry and acceptance of the omnigene diagnostics tests by the dental marketplace has been slower than anticipated. omnigene diagnostics' challenge for the future is to persuade the dental community that monitoring periodontal pathogen levels, as well as other clinical indicators of disease, is essential to providing optimal care to the periodontitis patient.

TI  == polymerase chain reaction detection of 8 putative periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque of gingivitis and advanced periodontitis lesions.
AB  == a 16s rrna-based polymerase chain reaction (pcr) detection method was used to determine the prevalence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia. prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola in subgingival specimens of 50 advanced periodontitis, 50 adult gingivitis and 50 pediatric gingivitis subjects. the optimal pcr conditions were determined for each study species. agarose gel electrophoresis of pcr products from each study species revealed a single band of the predicted size. restriction enzyme digestion of amplicons confirmed the specificity of the amplification. pcr detection limits were in the range of 25-100 cells. no cross-reactivity with other oral micro-organisms or nonspecific amplification was observed. the prevalence by pcr in advanced periodontitis, adult gingivitis and pediatric gingivitis subjects was 30%, 14% and 14% for a. actinomycetemcomitans, 86%, 18% and 8% for b. forsythus, 74%, 52% and 78% for c. rectus, 80%, 70% and 66% for e.  corrodens, 70%, 10% and 14% for p. gingivalis, 58%, 12% and 18% for p. intermedia, 52%, 20% and 22% for p. nigrescens, and 54%, 16% and 16% for t. denticola, respectively. the prevalence was higher in the advanced periodontitis  group than in both adult gingivitis and pediatric gingivitis for a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. forsythus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens  and t. denticola at p < 0.01, and for e. corrodens at p < 0.05. the prevalence of c. rectus was significantly higher in the advanced periodontitis group than in the adult gingivitis group at p < 0.01. matching results between pcr and culture  occurred in 28% (b. forsythus) to 71% (a. actinomycetemcomitans) of the samples;  the major discrepancy occurred in the pcr-positive/culture-negative category. matching results between pcr and dna probe methods were found in 84% of the subjects (b. forsythus) and 70% (p. gingivalis). odds ratio analysis revealed statistically significant positive associations between 17 of the 28 possible combinations (p < 0.01). this study demonstrated the utility of a 16s rrna-based  pcr detection method for identifying important subgingival microorganisms. the results indicated a strong association between the study species and periodontitis. several previously unreported symbiotic relationships were found between the 8 species tested.

TI  == evaluation of the long-term efficacy and safety of locally-applied minocycline in adult periodontitis patients.
AB  == the objectives of the present study were to establish in a long-term investigation the safety as well as the clinical and microbiological efficacy of  scaling and rootplaning combined with local application of 2% minocycline hydrochloride-gel versus placebo-gel in patients with moderate to severe chronic  adult periodontitis. this was an 18 months, randomized, double-blind, parallel, comparative study, in which 20 healthy patients with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis participated. at baseline, all patients received professional oral  hygiene-instruction and supra- and subgingival scaling and root planing. the minocycline-gel was applied subgingivally baseline, 2 weeks, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. microbiological evaluation was carried out using dmdx to identify the following bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum and treponema denticola. in addition standard microbiological techniques were used for the detection of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. micros, a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, f. nucleatum, c. albicans and enterobacteriaceae. results showed a statistically significant improvement for all clinical parameters irrespective of the treatment modality. no differences were observed between test and control with regard to probing depth and attachment level. the dmdx data showed a significant reduction in both the numbers and the prevalence over the 15 months period, but no significant difference between groups. culture data showed that at baseline two-third were positive for p. gingivalis and p. intermedia. analysis over the 18 month period showed no significant difference between the two treatment modalities. c. albicans and enterobacteriaceae were detected only in small proportions at each time interval in a limited number of patients. no adverse reactions were observed during the trial period. the present patient group responded favourably to scaling and rootplaning, but did not benefit from an effect of local of minocycline. subgingival debridement in combination with oral hygiene instruction by itself has been shown to be effective. it remains to be studied whether local  application of minocycline can be effective as an adjunct to mechanical therapy in sites that respond poorly to conventional treatment.

TI  == the effects of a pulsed nd:yag laser on subgingival bacterial flora and on cementum: an in vivo study.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to compare the effects of scaling and nd:yag laser  treatments with that of scaling alone on cementum and levels of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola. study samples consisted of 14 patients, age 30 to 75 years,  8 females and 6 males, with a total of 150 periodontally involved sites with probing depth > or = 5 mm. group a consisted of 100 pockets that were subdivided  into 4 equal groups that were treated with conventional scaling and pulsed nd:yag laser using an optic fiber of 300 microns and 4 different power levels as follows: group 1: p = 0.8 w, f = 10 hz, e = 100 mj/pulse; group 2: p = 1.0 w, f = 1.0 hz, e = 100 mj/pulse; group 3: p = 1.2 w, f = 12 hz, e = 100 mj/purse; and group 4: p = 1.5 w, f = 15 hz, e = 100 mj/pulse. the time of each treatment was 60 sec per pocket in all 4 groups. group b consisted of 50 pockets that were treated by conventional scaling alone and served as a control group. microbiological samples from group a were collected before scaling; after scaling = before laser, just after laser, 2 weeks later, 6 weeks later, and 10 weeks later. microbiological samples from group b were collected before scaling, after  scaling, 6 weeks later, and 10 weeks later. microbiological analysis of all samples was done by the institute fur angewandte immunologie (iai) method. the effects of laser on root surfaces were assessed by sem examination and the sample consisted of 13 teeth from 5 different patients. four sets of 3 teeth each were treated with nd:yag laser using 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, and 1.5 w, respectively. one tooth was just scaled and not treated with laser to serve as a control. microbiological analysis of group a samples indicated posttreatment reduction in levels of all 4  bacterial types tested compared to pretreatment levels and group b controls. sem  examination of the specimens treated with nd:yag laser at different levels exhibited different features of root surface alterations.

TI  == associations between porphyromonas gingivalis and oral treponemes in subgingival  plaque.
AB  == colonization and/or proliferation of treponema denticola may depend on the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis. the aims of this study were to confirm this synergistic relationship, to determine whether other oral bacteria were similarly associated with p. gingivalis and to relate coinfection to the periodontal status of plaque donors. subgingival plaque was collected from every tooth except third  molars in 106 subjects who were grouped by their worst periodontal condition. in  addition to p. gingivalis, monoclonal antibodies were used to identify campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, t. denticola, treponema socranskii and pathogen-related oral spirochetes. associations of these bacteria with coinfection by p. gingivalis were assessed by estimated odds ratios. the results  indicate that coinfection with p. gingivalis is linked to all tested bacteria, but each pair was associated with distinct periodontal conditions. the distribution of coinfected sites suggests biased colonization of facial surfaces  over lingual surfaces.

TI  == a comparison of cysteine and serine proteinases in human gingival crevicular fluid with tissue, saliva and bacterial enzymes by analytical isoelectric focusing.
AB  == gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) contains several different proteinase activities  and the study sought to clarify their sources. gingival tissue and gcf were collected from chronic periodontitis patients. gel-filtration chromatography of crude tissue extracts yielded cathepsin b and tryptase fractions sensitive to cysteine and serine proteinase inhibitors, respectively. cell sonicates of suspected periodontal pathogens were prepared from broth cultures of reference strains. of these, porphyromonas gingivalis showed much the strongest activity and this had an effector response consistent with the metal-dependent cysteine proteinase described by others. banding patterns in gcf, tissue and bacterial samples were compared on substrate-impregnated overlay membranes applied to isoelectric focusing gels. on z-val-lys-lys-arg-afc overlays, gcf had bands corresponding to tissue cathepsin b and the enzyme from p. gingivalis, though a contribution from treponema denticola could not be ruled out. use of d-val-leu-arg-afc overlays showed gcf activity similar to tissue tryptase. in gcf there were additional bands that did not correspond to any tissue or bacterial samples and on z-ala-ala-lys-afc overlays these closely resembled activity in parotid saliva. the results confirmed that gcf contains tissue cathepsin b and tryptase, while the apparent presence of enzymes from p. gingivalis and possibly  t. denticola is consistent with previous reports linking activity to these organisms. the saliva bands demonstrated that contamination of gcf may occur despite rigorous collection procedures.

TI  == antagonistic effect of oral bacteria towards treponema denticola.
AB  == this study was designed to isolate oral bacteria exhibiting antagonism towards treponema denticola and to characterize the inhibitory activity. eleven bacterial isolates obtained from subgingival sites and identified as either staphylococcus  aureus or streptococcus mutans were found to inhibit the growth of t. denticola.  when the activity spectra of these isolates were analyzed, two additional periodontopathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia) were found to be affected, whereas most gram-positive bacteria were not. strains of s. aureus produce a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (heat stable and protease  sensitive), whereas the inhibitory effect of s. mutans appears to be related to the production of lactic acid. the negative interactions reported in this paper may govern population shifts observed in subgingival sites.

TI  == proteolytic artifacts in sds-page analysis of selected periodontal pathogens.
AB  == the aim of the study was to examine whether proteolytic artifacts, which result in a loss and poor resolution of protein bands, occur during sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of cellular proteins from selected proteolytic (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola) and non-proteolytic (fusobacterium nucleatum) bacteria. conditions to limit or prevent proteolysis were also investigated. bacterial cells were incubated in solubilizing buffer (sds+ beta mercaptoethanol) at room temperature for various periods of time before boiling. a control assay consisted of trichloroacetic acid-treated bacterial cells. cellular proteins were separated by electrophoresis and stained with coomassie blue. proteolysis occurred very rapidly in the case of p. gingivalis (< 30 s), whereas a longer incubation time (> 1 h) was required to observe similar effects in p. nigrescens and t. denticola. no proteolysis was observed for f. nucleatum. in all cases, heat (100  degrees c) and low ph (< 4) treatments of bacterial cells could avoid production  of proteolytic artifacts. incorporation of specific protease inhibitors before solubilization of bacteria could also prevent proteolysis. more particularly, n-alpha-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (tlck), iodoacetamide and diisopropylfluorophosphate (50 mm) were highly efficient for p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens and t. denticola, respectively. when outer membranes of p. gingivalis  were prepared in the presence of tlck, numerous additional protein brands, not seen in the absence of tlck, were detected. the present study suggests that specific protease inhibitors, effective in preventing proteolysis, should be identified and added during cell fractionation and protein purification procedures.

TI  == degradation of host protease inhibitors and activation of plasminogen by proteolytic enzymes from porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola.
AB  == bacterial proteases may participate in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases through their action on host proteins. in the present study, the ability of selected periodontopathogens, as well as two proteases isolated from porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola, to degrade host protease inhibitors was evaluated. the activation of human plasminogen by the two bacterial proteases was also investigated. proteolytic breakdown of host protease inhibitors (alpha-1-antitrypsin, antichymotrypsin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, antithrombin iii, antiplasmin and cystatin c) was evaluated by sds-page. the 80 kda trypsin-like protease of p. gingivalis completely digested the six protease inhibitors under investigation, whereas the 95 kda chymotrypsin-like protease of  t. denticola was slightly less active, more particularly on alpha 2-macroglobulin and cystatin c. when whole cells from a number of oral bacterial species were tested, the most significant degradation was obtained with p. gingivalis, t. denticola, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and capnocytophaga spp. peptostreptococcus micros and propionibacterium acnes had only some degradative activity on selected inhibitors, whereas three bacterial species, actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus and fusobacterium nucleatum, had no  effect on the protease inhibitors. the 80 kda protease of p. gingivalis demonstrated strong plasminogen activation, whereas no such activity was associated with the 95 kda protease of t. denticola. this study indicates the high potential of some periodontal pathogens to destroy protease inhibitors and activate plasminogen. this may result in an uncontrolled degradation of periodontal tissues and a rapid progression of the disease.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and treponema denticola detection in oral plaque samples using the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == detection of putative pathogens is critical for delineating the etiology and progression of periodontitis. in the present study, we have used a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay utilizing primers specific for the lkt a gene of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, the fimbrial gene of porphyromonas gingivalis, and tdp a gene of treponema denticola in order to determine the presence of these pathogens in subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis sites. these gene specific primers were also used to assess the detection of different strains of bacteria in the pcr assays. primers for p. gingivalis detected p. gingivalis strain 33277, but no product was detected when primers were used with extracts from 4 species of capnocytophaga, 3 species of prevotella, 2 species of porphyromonas other than p. gingivalis, bacteroides levii, escherichia coli, 3 strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans and 3 strains of t. denticola. pcr analysis using primers for the lkt a gene of a. actinomycetemcomitans also did not result in a product with any of these bacteria with the exception of a positive result with 3 different strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans. primers selected from the tdp a gene of t. denticola did not identify any of the bacteria strains tested except t. denticola serovars a, b, and c. thus, these primers were shown to amplify gene segments that are specific to either p. gingivalis (33277), a. actinomycetemcomitans (33384, 43717  and 43718) or t. denticola (35405, 33521 and 35404). the pcr assay may be used to rapidly detect the presence of periodontal pathogens in the future.

TI  == periodontal status and detection frequency of bacteria at sites of periodontal health and gingivitis.
AB  == it is generally recognized that bacteria in dental plaque at sites of periodontal diseases are not commonly found at sites of periodontal health. one hypothesis to explain the etiology of periodontitis is that pathogenic bacteria from diseased sites infect healthy sites. it has been suggested that gingival inflammation may  predispose sites to colonization by bacteria associated with periodontal diseases. the purpose of this cross-sectional study was to determine whether the  detection frequency of selected bacteria at sites of periodontal health or gingivitis differed between subjects who were in good periodontal health, subjects who had gingivitis, or subjects with periodontitis. the clinical status  of every tooth (except third molars) from 106 subjects was characterized by means of clinical attachment level, probing depth and by signs of inflammation. subgingival plaque was collected from mesio-facial and disto-lingual surfaces. specific monoclonal antibodies were used in an immunocytochemical assay to identify campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, pathogen-related oral spirochetes (pros, using treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum monoclonal antibodies), t. denticola (serotypes a-d), t. socranskii subspecies buccale and t. socranskii subspecies socranskii. differences in detection of bacteria between groups of subjects were measured using odds ratios  (or). results of this study indicate that pros was the only identified bacterium  at sites of both health and gingivitis that demonstrated a significant positive relationship with the presence of periodontitis. these findings do not prove that bacteria spread from periodontitis sites, nor do they imply that disease necessarily results from infection. however, these data do suggest that some bacteria associated with periodontitis are more likely than others to tolerate conditions at healthy sites and that the presence of periodontitis increases risk of infection at healthy sites.

TI  == interbacterial binding among strains of pathogenic and commensal oral bacterial species.
AB  == strong interspecies adherence was demonstrated among the periodontal pathogens treponema denticola, bacteroides forsythus and porphyromonas gingivalis, and between these pathogens and the commensal plaque organism streptococcus crista. adherence showed specificity and demonstrated saturation binding kinetics. binding between b. forsythus and p. gingivalis appeared to be a unimodal protein-protein interaction. binding between the other organisms was at least bimodal involving interactions between combinations of proteins and carbohydrates with a variety of sugar specificities. salivary molecules prevented adherence between t. denticola and s. crista, and serum eliminated b. forsythus binding to  p. gingivalis. all other interactions occurred to some degree in the presence of  serum and saliva. such interbacterial binding interactions may be important in the establishment of periodontopathic plaque.

AB  == objective(s): this report compares the virulence of selected strains of p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, f. nucleatum and t. denticola in a murine model as a measure of pathogenic potential of these oral microorganisms. the characteristics of the tissue destruction associated with these monoinfections were then related to a potential model for bacterial synergism in  progressing periodontitis. design and methods: all bacterial strains were grown to mid-logarithmic to early stationary growth phase, harvested and used at various doses to challenge balb/c normal and balb/c dexamethasone (dex) treated mice to mimic a neutrophil dysfunction. the characteristics of tissue destruction, and overt tissue destructive capacity of these species were examined as a function of challenge dose and time. outcome measures: the mice were examined for an interval of approximately 15 days post-challenge and the presence/absence of lesions, localized or generalized nature of the lesion (including size in mm2), and lethality of the infection were assessed. results: comparison of the virulence of the various p. gingivalis strains related to lethality and lesion size associated with destruction of the connective tissue, indicated a virulence capacity of p. gingivalis strains 53977>w50 = t22>3079>33277>381. c. rectus elicited localized necrotic lesions which were limited to the epithelial layers of the skin. the size of the lesions also indicated a graded difference in virulence, such that c. rectus strains 234>576>>33238. a. actinomycetemcomitans caused the formation of classic localized abscesses with a pmn infiltrate and inflammatory exudates. although each of the a. actinomycetemcomitans strains exhibited a similar virulence pattern in this murine model, a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b representative  strains were potentially more pathogenic with a virulence capacity of 3113d-n = 3975a>jp2 > or = y4>29523>33384. both c. rectus and a. actinomycetemcomitans strains showed clear evidence that recent clinical isolates were more virulent than laboratory strains. challenge with f. nucleatum resulted in tissue destructive responses which were different from those observed with the other strains used in this study. a rapid onset of dose-dependent lesion development, related to the formation of either closed abscesses or open lesions, was observed with f. nucleatum. tissue involvement was also greater at lower f. nucleatum doses when compared to the other bacteria. f. nucleatum challenge of dex-treated  mice resulted in a shift to open lesions. t. denticola appeared to be more tissue invasive than the other species examined in this study. challenge of mice with t. denticola resulted in involvement of multiple tissues, including epithelial and connective tissues, as well as appearing to invade muscle layers and deeper tissues. in addition to invading deeper tissues, the resulting lesions took considerably longer to resolve. in the dex-treated mice (neutrophil depleted), p. gingivalis, c. rectus, and a. actinomycetemcomitans were significantly more virulent. in contrast, while dex treatment altered the characteristics of lesions caused by f. nucleatum, the extent of lesions produced by f. nucleatum and t. denticola was not substantially enhanced. conclusions: the results obtained from  this study suggest that different microorganisms have the ability to provide individual pathologies which may act in an additive/synergistic fashion contributing to the tissue destruction noted in periodontitis.

AB  == dental plaque is the major aetiological factor in periodontal diseases and contains several proteolytic enzymes. the origin of these proteinases is, however, poorly studied. this study was undertaken to characterize collagenase present in dental plaque of adult periodontitis patients. vertebrate-type rather  than bacterial-derived collagenase activity was detected in extracts of both supra- and subgingival dental plaque extracts of adult periodontitis patients. dental plaque collagenase was found to exist predominantly in autoactive form. dental plaque collagenase from periodontally healthy individuals existed in latent from. latent dental plaque collagenase from periodontitis lesions could be activated by a 95 kd chymotrypsin-like proteinase from treponema denticola and human leukocyte cathepsin g but not by human plasmin. incubation of purified latent leukocyte collagenase with whole cells of fusobacterium nucleatum, eubacterium saburreum, prevotella buccae and porphyromonas gingivalis, however, did not result to the activation of the enzyme. doxycycline in vitro inhibited dental plaque collagenase with an ic50-value of 20 microm. dental plaque collagenase degraded more efficiently type i and ii collagens than type iii collagen. western-blot analysis with specific anti-human neutrophil collagenase-antibody revealed that both in supra- and subgingival dental plaque extracts dental plaque collagenase had undergone proteolytic conversion from an 80 kd proform to a 58 kd active form which is associated with catalytic autoactivity as measured by functional collagenase assay. this reflects proteolytic activation of leukocyte collagenase in dental plaque probably by other proteases derived from potent periodontopathogenic bacteria such as t. denticola or other pmn proteases such as cathepsin g.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == distribution of porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola in human subgingival plaque at different periodontal pocket depths examined by immunohistochemical methods.
AB  == localization of porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola in different areas of subgingival plaque from advanced adult periodontitis patients was studied immunohistochemically using sensitive immunogold-silver staining and immunoelectron microscopy. fourteen periodontally diseased teeth were extracted without damaging the subgingival plaque, fixed, and embedded. the subgingival plaque samples were sectioned according to four different pocket depths (0-2 mm,  2-4 mm, 4-6 mm and > or = 6 mm). serial thin sections were stained using specific antisera to p. gingivalis or t. denticola and then with secondary antibody labelled with colloidal-gold. cells of both p. gingivalis and t. denticola were predominantly found in subgingival plaque located at depths of more than 4 mm in  periodontal pockets. t. denticola cells were found in the surface layers of subgingival plaque, and p. gingivalis were predominant beneath them. however, in  the deeper subgingival plaque, the coexistence of p. gingivalis and t. denticola  was observed. the present findings suggest that p. gingivalis and t. denticola play important roles in the pathogenicity of periodontal disease and provide the  useful information for elucidating the pattern of colonization of microorganisms  in the periodontal pocket.

TI  == comparison of host tissue and bacterial dipeptidyl peptidases in human gingival crevicular fluid by analytical isoelectric focusing.
AB  == earlier work has shown that gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) contains dipeptidyl peptidase (dpp) activities that resemble those in host tissue. here, further comparisons were made with enzymes from suspected periodontal pathogens. gingival tissue and gcf were collected from patients with chronic periodontitis. dpp ii and dpp iv fractions with acid and alkaline ph optima, respectively, were separated from crude tissue extracts by gel-filtration chromatography. bacterial  cell sonicates were prepared from broth cultures of reference strains. there was  moderate to strong dpp activity with capnocytophaga spp., porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella spp., very weak activity with treponema denticola and no detectable activity with actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or fusobacterium nucleatum. banding patterns in gcf, tissue and bacterial samples were compared on substrate-impregnated overlay membranes applied to isoelectric focusing gels. in  gels washed with acid buffer, gcf had bands corresponding to tissue dpp ii. use of an alkaline washing buffer showed gcf activity which closely matched tissue dpp iv that had been pretreated with neuraminidase, an enzyme found by others in  the gingival crevice. p. gingivalis gave multiple bands and several of these had  counterparts in gcf. the apparent presence in gcf of the dpp from p. gingivalis is consistent with the association of this organism with destructive periodontitis.

TI  == detection of putative periodontal pathogens in subgingival specimens by 16s ribosomal dna amplification with the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == the utility of the 16s ribosomal rna-based polymerase chain reaction (pcr) for detection of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and treponema denticola was examined and compared with that of anaerobic culture. primer pairs consisting of 20-27 nucleotides amplified 404- to 688-bp regions of 16s ribosomal rna genes of these organisms. this method had a lower detection limit of 50 target cells in a background of 10(7) cells. its specificity for b. forsythus, p. gingivalis, and t. denticola seemed high. the primers for a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, and p. intermedia cross-reacted  with some closely related species but did not reveal amplification products in tests with more distantly related organisms. the primers for e. corrodens did not seem to cross-react with oral organisms. this pcr technique was sensitive, reproducible, and easy to perform. pcr-based amplification may prove valuable for the detection of some periodontal pathogens in crude subgingival specimens.

TI  == oligonucleotide probes to the 16s ribosomal rna: implications of sequence homology and secondary structure with particular reference to the oral species prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == eight oligonucleotides based upon regions of the small subunit 16s ribosomal rna  gene sequences were analysed against a background of their position within the molecule and their two-dimensional structure to rationalise their use in recognising prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens. the 41 clinical isolates from both oral and respiratory sites and two reference strains were subjected to dna-dna hybridisation and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis to confirm their identity. alignment of oligonucleotide probes designated i bi-2 to  i bi-6 (for p. intermedia) and 2bi-2 (for p. nigrescens) with the 16s rrna suggested that these probes lacked specificity or were constructed from hypervariable regions. a 52-mer oligonucleotide (designated bi) reliably detected both species. because of the high degree of concordance between the 16s rrnas of  both species, it was necessary to vary the stringency of hybridisation conditions for detection of both species. thus probe i bi-i recognised p. intermedia while i bi-i detected both p. intermedia and p. nigrescens at low stringency. however, under conditions of high stringency only p. nigrescens was recognised by probe 2bi-i. these probes were highly specific and did not hybridise with dna from the  closely related p. corporis, nor other periodontal pathogens such as fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola and several pigmented species such as prevotella melaninogenica, p. denticola, p. loescheii, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, py. endodontalis, py. gingivalis, py. levii, and py. macacae.

TI  == purification and general properties of an oligopeptidase from treponema denticola atcc 35405--a human oral spirochete.
AB  == an endo-acting oligopeptidase (opase) was purified to homogeneity from the cells  of treponema denticola atcc 35405--a human oral spirochete--by a procedure that comprised a mild triton x-100 extraction (which disintegrates the outer membrane  but leaves the cells morphologically intact) and four successive fast protein liquid chromatographic steps of the extract. the activity of this oligopeptidase  (formerly named "trypsin-like" enzyme and "bana-peptidase") together with the proteinase activities of t. denticola and porphyromonas gingivalis is utilized in a diagnostic test for human periodontal infections, but the enzyme's chemical nature has not been studied. the enzyme is a cell-associated 78-kda protein with  an isoelectric point of 6.1, and its estimated minimum peptide length was 688 amino acid residues. the opase does not hydrolyze proteins, but hydrolyzes -x-arg-p-nitroaniline peptides between arginine and the chromogen, the optimum ph of hydrolysis covering a broad ph range (7 to 9). the opase is not a metalloenzyme, although 1.0 mmol/liter ca(ii) increases the rate of the hydrolysis of all substrates. ca(ii) did not affect the values of the michaelis constant. the opase activity is not dependent on reactive sh-groups, but is suggested to depend on the catalytic triad cooh. . .his. . .ser. the n-terminal sequence for the first 29 amino acid residues is mkqsdfekppiaeiketrfekfgktridn. the purified enzyme is very sensitive to chlorhexidine acetate (mixed inhibition; ki = 0.85 microm) and somewhat less sensitive to bacitracin (ki(app) = 27.5 microm). the present opase is considered to belong to the serine peptidases, functionally resembling trypsin except that the opase does not hydrolyze proteins. the opase may be regarded as an oligopeptidase, the substrate specificity profile of which resembles to a certain extent that of some members of the coagulation cascade.

TI  == detection of peptidase activity from treponema denticola, porphyromonas forsythus, and bacteroides forsythus as a means of periodontal therapy evaluation.
AB  == we have previously reported that the periocheck test offers a rapid, simple periodontal diagnostic tool by detecting peptidase activity specifically attributed to treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, and bacteroides forsythus. relationships between the peptidase activity detected by the periocheck test and clinical measures were investigated. fifty-seven periocheck-positive sites selected from 27 patients with adult periodontitis were subjected to scaling and root planing. two weeks later, a periocheck test was undertaken in the test sites. two groups were then determined, one composed of 40 periocheck-positive sits, and the other consisting of 17 periocheck-negative sites. all sites were re-examined at 6, 10, 14 and 18 weeks using both the periocheck test and clinical measures. on week 18, the negative group displayed a significant decrease in probing pocket depth (pd) and a significant attachment level (al) gain (2.1 and 1.2 mm, respectively), while the positive group showed a slight decrease in pd and al gain (0.9 and 0.3 mm, respectively). the differences between negative and positive groups in pd and al became statistically significant by the tenth week. improvement of gingival index (gi) and bleeding on probing (bop) was more apparent in the negative group. the detection of intrapocket microbiological status by the periocheck test preceded the changes in pd, al, gi, and bop after periodontal therapy. in conclusion, the periocheck test may provide a promising chairside monitoring tool for effectively evaluating therapies associated with scaling and root planing.

TI  == effect of initial therapy on dynamics of immunogloblin g levels to some periodontopathic bacteria in serum and gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the igg antibody levels to specific gram-negative periodontopathic bacteria in serum of 21 adult periodontitis patients and the gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) from 42 sites with destructive lesions and 21 healthy sites were evaluated before and after initial preparation. porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, treponema denticola and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in subgingival plaque samples from the patients were examined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. subgingival plaque, gcf, and serum samples were taken at baseline and three weeks after initial preparation. for 14 patients, changes in clinical parameters due to the initial preparation were correlated with reduction of periodontopathogens and to  igg antibody levels in gcf and serum against them. p. gingivalis, t. denticola and c. rectus were found to be predominant in destructive sites. no significant differences were found in gcf igg antibody levels between destructive and healthy sites. in destructive sites, the prevalence of p. gingivalis and c. rectus was significantly correlated with elevated igg antibody against these microorganisms  in gcf. the initial preparation resulted in significant reduction of serum igg antibody levels against all microorganisms tested. no decrease in gcf igg antibody was observed, but levels to p. gingivalis and c. rectus were significantly increased (p<0.05). the assessment of gcf igg antibodies to specific periodontopathic bacteria may be of considerable value in reflecting the conditions of periodontitis.

TI  == coaggregation between porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola.
AB  == to elucidate an ecological profile of several periodontopathogens, the authors examined the coaggregation between cells of porphyromonas gingivalis and oral bacterial strains including treponema denticola in vitro. coaggregation between cells of plaque bacteria was examined by visual assay and phase-contrast microscope. p. gingivalis cells coaggregated with strains of t. denticola and treponema socranskii subspecies socranskii, but did not coaggregate with t. socranskii subspecies buccale, t. socranskii subspecies paredis, treponema vincentii, or treponema pectinovorum. the extracted hemagglutinin from p. gingivalis was active agglutinating t. denticola cells. addition of serum and saliva somewhat affected the coaggregation, but no effects of tested sugars or amino acids were found. heat treatment of t. denticola cells did not reduce the coagregation: heat treatment of p. gingivalis cells eliminated it. growth inhibitory activity among these bacterial species was examined by the stab culture method. strains of t. denticola atcc 35404 and 35405 and t. vincentii inhibited the growth of some p. gingivalis strains, but not others. no strain of  treponema was inhibited by black-pigmented anaerobic rods. the coaggregation observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola indicates the potential importance of their simultaneous existence in human periodontal pockets and development of the disease.

TI  == presence of treponema denticola and porphyromonas gingivalis in children correlated with periodontal disease of their parents.
AB  == considerable evidence exists suggesting that periodontal disease is due to the overgrowth of a finite number of specific bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, bacteroides forsythus, and prevotella intermedia, among others. three of these organisms-p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and b. forsythus-can be easily detected in plaque samples by the hydrolysis of the synthetic trypsin substrate benzoyl-dl-arginine-naphthylamide (bana). the aim of the present study was to determine if a relationship could be found between the presence of either these organisms of periodontitis in the parent and the presence of bana-positive species in the child. thirty-four mothers or fathers and 34 children were examined for plaque scores, papillary bleeding scores, and the presence of p. gingivalis and t. denticola in four subgingival or marginal gingival plaque samples as assayed by the bana test or specific polyclonal antibodies using an elisa. children whose parents were colonized by bana-positive bacteria were 9.8 times more likely to be colonized by these bana-positive species. children whose  parents had clinical evidence of periodontitis were 12 times more likely to be colonized by these bana-positive species. these data are compatible with the hypothesis that children may acquire the bana-positive species from their parents, especially if the parent has periodontitis.

TI  == trypsin-like activity levels of treponema denticola and porphyromonas gingivalis  in adults with periodontitis.
AB  == treponema denticola (td) and porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) are associated with human moderate and severe adult periodontal diseases. this study quantifies these two anaerobes and their trypsin-like (tl) activities in subgingival plaque collected from both clinically healthy and periodontally diseased sites of human  periodontitis patients. antigen levels of the microorganisms were determined by monoclonal antibodies and tl activities were measured by the fluorescent substrate z-gly-gly-arg-afc in a disc format. significant positive correlations were observed between the antigen levels and the tl activities when the data were subjected to statistical analyses both on a site-specific and on a patient basis. anaerobe synergism was found between td and pg in a continental us population, and positive correlations were found between anaerobe levels (individually and total) and clinical indicators of adult periodontitis.

TI  == bacteriological diagnosis of periodontal disease.
AB  == dental plaque bacteria cause virtually all the forms of inflammatory periodontal  disease. periodontitis is caused by the specific periodontopathic bacteria, which induce destruction of connective tissue attachment and adjacent alveolar bone. examinations to identify the infections by porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens and treponema denticola have recently become essential in diagnosis of periodontal disease. bacterial examination permits (1) identification of the causative bacteria, (2) assessment of disease activity and (3) monitoring of the effective  of periodontal treatments. the author describes details of accurate and rapid methods for detecting periodontopathogens. transmission of periodontopathic bacteria as clarified by bacterial examination is also discussed in this review.  the pathogenic potential of specific bacteria varies among patients and periodontally healthy individuals and can be controlled by host defense mechanisms such as immune responses. the roles of immune responses against periodontopathic bacteria in balance shifts of periodontal disease processes are  therefore also discussed in this review.

TI  == effect of proteolytic enzymes on the lysis and growth of oral bacteria.
AB  == previous studies have shown increased levels of proteolytic enzymes in affected periodontal sites. the aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the effect of proteolytic environments on the lysis and growth of selected oral bacteria associated with either healthy or diseased periodontal sites. the effect of trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase k on cell lysis was determined following  incubation with bacteria, whereas the effect of the same proteolytic enzymes on bacterial growth was tested using a disc-plate technique. overall, gram-positive  bacteria appeared to be more resistant to lysis than gram-negative bacteria. the  most susceptible bacteria were actinomyces spp., eubacterium saburreum, prevotella intermedia, capnocytophaga ochracea, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loescheii, treponema denticola and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the disc-plate procedure indicated that the growth of actinomyces spp., e. saburreum, c. ochracea, p. intermedia, p. loescheii, porphyromonas gingivalis and t. denticola were the most affected, more particularly by chymotrypsin and proteinase k. interestingly, the growth of f. nucleatum was rather stimulated by proteolytic enzymes. the observations reported in this investigation indicate that specific and general proteolytic activities have the ability to lyse some oral bacterial species and to interfere with their  growth. it is suggested that such effects could represent new mechanisms by which the bacterial ecology of subgingival sites may be affected.

TI  == comparison of dna probe and elisa microbial analysis methods and their association with adult periodontitis.
AB  == the purposes of this study were two-fold: to compare the dna probe and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) microbial identification tests and correlate the levels of microorganisms with adult periodontitis. a single plaque sample were taken from each of 2 sites in 52 patients. twelve of these patients were also sampled during and after treatment. the experimental site had clinical indicators of disease (bleeding on probing, probing and attachment loss of > or = 6 mm) and the contralateral site (control) was clinically healthy. a total of 176 plaque samples were collected, divided, processed, and sent for both types of quantitative microbial analyses. all of these samples were used to compare the dna probe and elisa methods while only the initial 104 pretreatment sites were used to correlate microorganisms/method with clinical indicators of adult periodontitis. dna probes were used to assay for a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, t. denticola, and c. rectus. an elisa utilizing monoclonal antibodies was used to assay for p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, t. denticola, and c. rectus. comparison of the two methods revealed that the elisa test identified p. gingivalis and c. rectus significantly more often than the dna probe method and that t. denticola was detected more frequently with the dna probe. the sensitivities and specificities  varied widely among organisms and by test. p. gingivalis, as identified by elisa, had the highest degree of sensitivity and specificity (0.90 and 0.82 respectively) to clinical indicators of adult periodontitis.

TI  == detection of porphyromonas gingivalis in gingival exudate by a dipeptide-enhanced trypsin-like activity.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis in subgingival plaque is an important risk factor for future periodontal attachment loss in susceptible adults. the elimination of p. gingivalis is usually concomitant with a healing process. therefore, it should be valuable to have an easy chairside method to follow the effect of periodontal treatment on p. gingivalis detection as well as on its eventual reappearance during the maintenance period. we have previously reported the stimulation of amidolytic activity of p. gingivalis by the addition of glycyl-glycine to the assay buffer. in this study we determined the proportions of p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga spp, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens by cultivation technique and the amidolytic activity, using n-benzoyl-l-arginine-p-nitroanilide (bapna) as substrate, in gingival exudate before and during a 3-year treatment and maintenance period. p. gingivalis was the only species yielding a high and persistent correlation to stimulated amidolytic activity (p values < or = 0.0001) on both site (r = 0.5) and subject (r = 0.8) level. testing pure cultures of suggested periodontal pathogens for effect of glycyl-glycine on amidolytic activity, we found that of p. gingivalis to be 5.9-fold increased. the amidolytic activity of treponema denticola was only slightly stimulated (ratio with/without glycyl-glycine = 1.2) and that of capnocytophaga slightly inhibited (ratio with/without glycyl-glycine = 0.8). the  outcome of this study has the potential to be used for the development of a simple, rapid, and inexpensive assay for a qualitative and quantitative determination of p. gingivalis in gingival crevicular fluid.

TI  == relationship between volatile sulfur compounds, bana-hydrolyzing bacteria and gingival health in patients with and without complaints of oral malodor.
AB  == the aim of this study was to obtain measurements of oral malodor, as measured by  volatile sulfur compounds (vsc), in periodontally healthy individuals without any complaints of bad breath, and to compare the results with data obtained from patients with complaints of oral malodor. the quality of the mouth air was assessed organoleptically and a portable sulfide monitor was used to measure the  concentration of vsc in mouth air. the gingival health of 35 individuals (21 m, 14 f; ages 18-57 years) without any malodor complaints was evaluated according to the papillary bleeding score (pbs). pocket depths and bleeding upon probing (bop) were also recorded in 20 patients (11 females and 9 males ranging in age from 14  to 71 years) who complained of oral malodor. scrapings of the dorsal surface of the tongue and each of 6 plaque samples per patient were evaluated for the presence of bana-positive species, such as t. denticola, p. gingivalis, and b. forsythus. the organoleptic ratings and vsc values were significantly higher in the complaint group (p < 0.05). subjects in the complaint group had a significantly higher percentage of bleeding sites (p < 0.005) and had significantly more plaques that tested positive for the presence of bana-hydrolyzing species (p < 0.05). tongue scrapings of subjects with a high organoleptic score consistently yielded a positive bana reaction suggesting that  the dorsal surface of the tongue is an important niche for bana-positive, vsc-producing bacteria. this study suggests that the primary sources of vsc production are bana-hydrolyzing bacteria in the plaque and on the dorsal surface  of the tongue.

TI  == configural frequency analysis for exploring bacterial sets in periodontal health  and disease.
AB  == periodontal research has been concerned with identifying bacterial sets in oral health and disease. configural frequency analysis (cfa) is a taxonomical method used to test the statistical significance of patterns of elementary cell frequencies in cross-tabulated data, and may therefore be used to evaluate interactions among occurrences and non-occurrences of periodontal microorganisms. cfa patterns may exist as configural types or anti-types depending on whether observed cell frequencies are greater or less than expected frequencies, respectively, based on table marginals. cfa was applied to two published data sets. in the first, the occurrence of bacteroides (porphyromonas) gingivalis (bg) and treponema denticola (td) was studied in military subjects. analysis of individual cells of the resultant two-by-two contingency table revealed the existence of a single anti-type (td in the absence of bg) suggesting a sequential phenomenon. the second, more complex, data set was based on reported occurrence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), bg, and bacteroides (prevotella) intermedius (bi) in sites with and without progressive periodontitis. cfa based on all data identified three statistically significant configural types and two anti-types. however, a somewhat different configurational picture emerged when disease progression status was considered a stratification variable for separate  analysis. all these analyses, which were undertaken for expository purposes, assumed independence of observations. methodological procedures are suggested for cfa when observations are not independent.

TI  == the effects of incubation length and temperature on the specificity and sensitivity of the bana (n-benzoyl-dl-arginine-naphthylamide) test.
AB  == a previous multi-center study examining patients diagnosed as having at least four periodontally diseased teeth showed that when bana (n-benzoyl-dl-arginine-naphthylamide) hydrolysis by periodontal pathogens such as treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, and bacteroides forsythus was evaluated versus clinical parameters such as clinical judgment of disease, bleeding on probing, and pocket depth, the sensitivity of the test was 84%, 82%,  and 87%, respectively, while the specificity was only 42%, 41%, and 32%, respectively. the purpose of the present investigation was to improve the specificity of the test while retaining a high level of sensitivity in both gingivally healthy and periodontally diseased groups. one hundred forty-nine patients participated in this study providing 3,497 interproximal plaque samples. gingival health was measured using the papillary bleeding score and this was compared with the presence or absence of detectable trypsin-like activity, as determined by the bana hydrolysis of interproximal plaque samples, using a commercially-available test. sensitivity and specificity were measured by varying the incubation time and temperature of the enzymatic assay. using the correlated  binomial model to analyze site-specific data within a patient, the specificity was highest at 35 degrees c and 5 minutes incubation (94%), and lowest at 45 degrees c and 15 minutes incubation (33%). sensitivity was highest at 45 degrees  c or 55 degrees c and 15 minutes incubation (90%) and lowest at 35 degrees c and  5 minutes incubation (47%).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the growth response of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and treponema denticola to peptides (supplied as trypticase) and amino acids (supplied as casamino acids) was measured over 24 hours by monitoring changes in  alternating-current conductivity at 37 degrees c. all species utilized peptides preferentially over amino acids. these results are consistent with those obtained previously with conventional growth-response experiments. the duration of the linear growth response to trypticase of p. gingivalis was 9.7 hours, whereas that of both f. nucleatum and t. denticola was > 24 hours. by contrast, there was more uniformity in the utilization of amino acids from the casamino acid mixture, which previously has been shown to be a poor growth substrate. furthermore, subtle differences in growth patterns, such as the ability of f. nucleatum to metabolize its storage glycopolymers before utilizing amino acids, were clearly evident. the present method provides an excellent means of studying bacterial growth kinetics and delineating bacterial/substrate specificities of both synthetic and natural substrates.

AB  == cell-free culture filtrates of porphyromonas gingivalis grown in wilkins-chalgren broth stimulated the growth of six strains of treponema denticola in 1186 broth when compared with the effect of uninoculated wc. the ph of the 1186 broth was not altered by the addition of either culture filtrate or wc, and all media were  fully reduced prior to inoculation with t. denticola. growth was also stimulated  by factors precipitated from the culture filtrate with 90% (nh4)2so4, 50% cold ethanol, or 50% cold acetone, and by factors retained after dialysis of the culture filtrate through a membrane with a molecular weight cut-off of 50 kda. growth factor activity was eliminated by heating of the culture filtrate at 55 degrees c for 4 h. an ether extract of the culture filtrate containing acetic, butyric, isobutyric, isovaleric, propionic, and phenylacetic acids did not stimulate growth. since subgingival plaque from periodontal pockets colonized with t. denticola also contains p. gingivalis, certain extracellular proteins with molecular weights greater than 50 kda produced by p. gingivalis may act as growth factors for t. denticola in the microenvironment of the periodontal pocket.

TI  == bacterial mediators in periodontal disease.
AB  == periodontal disease is the general description given to the inflammatory response of the gingiva and underlying connective tissue to bacterial accumulations (dental plaque) on the teeth. a limited number of cultivable species are usually  associated with periodontal disease. the majority of putative periodontal pathogens are gram-negative anaerobic rods. some of the characteristics of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola will be discussed, given their prominence in the literature. these organisms share the ability to penetrate the gingival epithelium, such that their endotoxins, immunologically active compounds, and cytotoxic enzymes and molecules are presented directly to the host's inflammatory cells. this ability may be what distinguishes these gram-negative species from the plethora of other gram-negative species that inhabit the subgingival plaque. in addition, these organisms tend to be selected for in disease-associated plaques, suggesting that  their nutritional needs are met when the gingival crevicular fluid contains a variety of inflammatory mediators and products of tissue breakdown. a. actinomycetemcomitans produces a leukotoxin, and the immunologic response of the  host to this antigen may explain the unique pattern of tooth involvement in localized juvenile periodontitis. both p. gingivalis and t. denticola have a trypsin-like enzyme that could be a virulence factor, primarily because this enzyme(s) may allow these organisms to grow in the presence of the inflammatory response of the host.

TI  == aspartame as a source of essential phenylalanine for the growth of oral anaerobes.
AB  == phenylalanine and aspartic acid requirements were determined for 13 species of oral bacteria using the chemically defined medium omiz-w1. none of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, eikenella corrodens, selenomonas sputigena, treponema pectinovorum, t. socranskii, or wolinella recta required either of these amino acid constituents of aspartame (l-aspartyl-l-phenylalanine  methylester). phenylalanine was essential for the growth of capnocytophaga gingivalis, eubacterium timidum, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. vincentii, while aspartic acid was not required. with the exception of e. timidum, all phenylalanine-dependent strains could grow  when the free amino acid was replaced by aspartame at concentrations at least 10-fold lower than those used for aspartame as an artificial sweetener.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of acacia gum was assessed using fresh isolates and reference strains of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga spp., porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola. a fine aqueous suspension of gum was produced by sonication and then a soluble fraction  isolated by centrifugation and membrane filtration. these preparations were incorporated into columbia agar at doubling concentrations. growth of p. gingivalis and p. intermedia cultures on the agar was inhibited by whole gum sonicate at concentrations of 0.5-1.0% w/v. both species showed reduced susceptibility when horse blood was present in the agar. the gum soluble fraction did not inhibit growth of any bacterial culture. the effect of acacia on bacterial proteases was examined with cell sonicates from log phase broth cultures. enzyme activities were determined by fluorimetric assay with various synthetic peptide substrates. most protease activities reduced in the presence of 0.5% w/v gum sonicate, with the trypsin-like activities of p. gingivalis and p. intermedia proving most sensitive. the gum soluble fraction was nearly always less inhibitory than the sonicate. the action of acacia gum against suspected periodontal pathogens and their enzymes suggests that it may be of clinical value.

TI  == the effect of incubation temperature on the specificity of the bana (n-benzoyl-dl-arginine-naphthylamide) test.
AB  == the hydrolysis of bana by subgingival plaque samples is associated with the presence of either treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, and/or bacteroides forsythus. a protocol in which pure cultures were incubated for 15 min at 55 degrees c detected about 5 x 10(5) cfu of p. gingivalis and 1 x 10(6) cfu of t. denticola. clinical studies indicated that the bana test in this configuration will detect about 10(4) organisms in vivo as compared with the 10(5) to 10(6) organisms found with in vitro grown cells. the bana test can be made less sensitive by decreasing the time and/or temperature of incubation, which could improve the specificity of the test. in the present study we determined the incubation parameters that would give optimal specificity when the plaque samples were removed from sites of gingival health. twenty-six approximal  plaque samples were taken from each of 90 clinically healthy subjects and incubated with the bana substrate on perioscan cards (oral-b laboratories) for 5  and 15 min at 35 degrees, 45 degrees, and 55 degrees c. subjects were randomly assigned to the various temperatures. wooden toothpicks were inserted interproximally in all sites anterior to distal of the first molars and then each side of the toothpick was wiped onto the perioscan card. the specificity of the bana test relative to clinical health was 96% when the cards were incubated for 5 min at 35 degrees c, but decreased to 50-70% when the cards were incubated for 15 min at 35 degrees c or for 5 and 15 min at 45 degrees c and 55 degrees c.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the use of a rapid enzymatic assay in the field for the detection of infections associated with adult periodontitis.
AB  == there are few objective assays for studies of the epidemiology of periodontal diseases. the perioscan is an assay capable of detecting three periodontal pathogens, namely t. denticola, p. gingivalis, and b. forsythus, which have been  associated with adult periodontitis. the perioscan was tested in a sample of 301  brazilians. clinical indices--bleeding, probing depth, gingival index, and periodontal index--were recorded from four sites in each subject. subgingival plaque samples were collected from those sites and placed on the perioscan card.  color results were scored in the field after 15 minutes. the plaque samples were  screened with polyclonal antibodies for the three species by an elisa system. the perioscan, when compared with the elisa system, yields a sensitivity of 91 percent, specificity of 89 percent, and an accuracy of 90 percent. when the perioscan was compared to clinical indices, there was a high sensitivity (at least 93%) and a low specificity (no less than 47%), with an accuracy of at least 61 percent.

TI  == phosphorylated nutrient uptake by treponema denticola and other potential periodontopathogens.
AB  == nutrient uptake may contribute to the survival of certain potential periodontopathogens in the competitive environment of the gingival sulcus. this study was conducted to assess the uptake of commercially available, key radiolabelled phosphorylated compounds by treponema denticola. there was a linear relationship in the uptake of atp and g-1-p with cell concentrations of 0.1-2.5 mg of cell dry weight. this uptake reached a steady state within 15 min, and at temperatures of 25-37 degrees c the uptake ranged between 13-21%. at 50 degrees c, or above 50 degrees c the assay cells took up 0-1% of the assay nutrients. the maximum uptake of atp was 47.5, 38 and 47.6 pmoles for serovars a, b and c. g-1-p yielded maximum uptake values of 306, 304, and 306 pmoles respectively. significant uptake of atp, or g-1-p occurred at ph 4.8 for serovars a, or c, while serovar b showed a broad ph range for the uptake of g-1-p. stannous fluoride at a concentration of 0.17 mm enhanced the uptake of atp while chlorhexidine digluconate inhibited the uptake of atp. at concentrations usually  employed (0.05-0.5 mm) the metabolic poisons 2,4-dinitrophenol, sodium azide, sodium arsenite and the atpase inhibitor n,n1-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide did not alter significantly the uptake of atp. the uptake of atp, by actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and t. denticola at ph 4.8 was 13.4, 1.5, 6.9, and 18-20.4%, respectively. at ph 6.5 the uptake for the microorganisms indicated above was 22, 1.3, 6.6 and 6.2%, respectively. g-1-p showed the same trend in its uptake by a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum and t. denticola. this study provides for the first time specific examples of phosphorylated nutrient uptake by potential periodontopathogens, and that the uptake of phosphorylated nutrients can be suppressed by oral hygienic compounds.

TI  == nutritional interactions between two suspected periodontopathogens, treponema denticola and porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == a mutual symbiotic enhancement of growth of porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola is described in this report. brain heart infusion broth supplemented with vitamin k did not support the individual growth of p. gingivalis or t. denticola. however, when inoculated as a mixture, both bacterial species did grow significantly. the growth-stimulating factors produced by p. gingivalis and t. denticola were dialyzable and heat stable and were further identified as isobutyric acid and succinic acid, respectively. since some forms of periodontal disease are associated with the presence, in affected sites, of high numbers of p. gingivalis and spirochetes, it is suggested that the bacterial interaction described in this report might be of utmost importance in the initiation and progression of the disease.

AB  == activation of latent human fibroblast-type and neutrophil interstitial procollagenases as well as degradation of native type i collagen by supra- and subgingival dental plaque extracts, an 80-kda trypsinlike protease from porphyromas gingivalis (atcc 33277), a 95-kda chymotrypsinlike protease from treponema denticola (atcc 29522), and selected bacterial species commonly isolated in periodontitis was studied. the bacteria included were prevotella intermedia (atcc 25261), prevotella buccae (es 57), prevotella oris (atcc 33573), porphyromonas endodontalis (es 54b), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (atcc 295222), fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc 10953), mitsuokella dentalis (dsm 3688), and streptococcus mitis (atcc 15909). none of the bacteria activated latent procollagenases; however, both sub- and supragingival dental plaque extracts (neutral salt extraction) and proteases isolated from cell extracts from potentially periodontopathogenic bacteria p. gingivalis and t. denticola were found to activate latent human fibroblast-type and neutrophil interstitial procollagenases. the fibroblast-type interstitial collagenase was more efficiently activated by bacterial proteases than the neutrophil counterpart, which instead preferred nonproteolytic activation by the oxidative agent hypochlorous acid. the proteases were not able to convert collagenase tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (timp-1) complexes into active form or to change the ability of timp-1 to inhibit interstitial collagenase. none of the studied bacteria, proteases from p. gingivalis and t. denticola, or extracts of supra- and subgingival dental plaque showed any significant collagenolytic activity. however, the proteases degraded native and denatured collagen fragments after cleavage by interstitial collagenase and gelatinase. our results indicate that proteases from periodontopathogenic bacteria can act as direct proteolytic activators of human procollagenases and degrade collagen fragments. thus, in concert with host enzymes the bacterial proteases may participate in periodontal  tissue destruction.

TI  == demonstration of a bimodal coaggregation reaction between porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola.
AB  == this study demonstrates a strong coaggregation reaction between 2 suspected periodontopathogens: porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. other black-pigmented oral bacterial species tested did not coaggregate with t. denticola. this specific interbacterial aggregation was bimodal, since heating of both cell types was required to completely eliminate the reaction. the coaggregation reaction occurred between ph 4 and 9. under some conditions, arginine and d-galactosamine were effective in preventing the coaggregation. the  heat-sensitive receptor on p. gingivalis was found to be loosely bound and could  be released by a light ultrasonic treatment of the cells. it is suggested that the bacterial interaction described may participate in the establishment of a potentially pathogenic subgingival plaque.

TI  == growth of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, t. pectinovorum, t. socranskii, and t. vincentii in a chemically defined medium.
AB  == a chemically defined medium, omiz (oral microbiology and immunology, zurich)-w1 was developed. medium omiz-w1 supports the long-term proliferation of a wide range of oral anaerobes, including representative strains of four treponema species and porphyromonas gingivalis. high concentrations of ascorbic acid and ammonium ions proved to be important for the growth of these organisms. t. denticola cd-1 grew in the absence of polyamines and long-chain fatty acids, t. pectinovorum and t. socranskii required polyamines, whereas t. vincentii depended on both polyamines and lecithin for growth. specific requirements for purines and/or pyrimidines were detected, and these requirements could be used to distinguish haemophilus-actinobacillus group organisms. some strains of p. gingivalis grew without vitamin k, while others were not satisfied by menadione but required its precursor 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid. protoporphyrin ix or hemin equally satisfied the porphyrin requirements of p. gingivalis and bacteroides forsythus, whereas ferrous sulfate was more efficiently used as a source of iron than was hemin. the cellular cohesiveness of p. gingivalis increased with high concentrations of hemin in the growth medium. prevotella intermedia, b. forsythus, and several strains of p. gingivalis were more fastidious and required a protein or serum supplement to grow in medium omiz-w1.

AB  == aqueous extracts from 5 plants used widely in kenya as chewing sticks (mswaki) for the control of oral hygiene were tested for their ability to inhibit extracellular peptidase and glycosidase enzyme activities produced by the periodontopathic bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly bacteroides gingivalis), bacteroides intermedius and treponema denticola. the plants studied  were rhus natalensis, cupressus hisitanica, sida cordifolia, olea africana and euclea divinorum. protease activities, including glycylprolyl dipeptidase and trypsin-like activities of p. gingivalis, chymotrypsin-like and glycylprolyl dipeptidase activities of b. intermedius and the trypsin-like activity of t. denticola, were particularly affected by extracts from rhus natalensis and euclea divinorum. glycosidase activities were generally less affected with the notable exceptions of the inhibition of beta-mannosidase activity of p. gingivalis by all extracts and the inhibition of neuraminidase activity of t. denticola by rhus natalensis and euclea divinorum. generally, these same proteolytic and glycosidic activities were inhibited by tannic acid and to lesser extents by gallic acid and gallic acid methyl ester. an inhibitory component, present in all extracts, exhibited physical and chemical properties identical to those of tannic acid. the inhibition of these enzyme activities is likely to reduce the virulence of these  periodontophathic bacteria and to reduce the rate of dental plaque formation.

TI  == a sensitive enzymatic method (sk-013) for detection and quantification of specific periodontopathogens.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, and treponema denticola have been found to predominate in periodontal pockets of patients with adult periodontitis. these microorganisms hydrolyze the synthetic peptide n-benzoyl-dl-arginine-2-naphthylamide (bana). in this study, we developed an enzymatic method, designated sk-013, to detect the existence of these microorganisms in subgingival plaque bacteria. this enzymatic method was based on the observation of the hydrolysis of n-carbobenzoxy-glycyl-glycyl-arginyl-3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxyaniline (n-cbz-gly-gly-arg-dbha) and made more sensitive by adding an enhancing system. the sk-013 was specifically positive for p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, t. denticola, and some strains of capnocytophaga species, but was not specific for any of the other bacterial strains tested. this sk-013 system may be valuable for detection and quantification of periodontal disease-associated bacteria in subgingival plaque and thus for diagnosis of periodontal infections.

TI  == comparison of various detection methods for periodontopathic bacteria: can culture be considered the primary reference standard?
AB  == the development of diagnostic tests for a periodontal infection raises the issue  as to what the appropriate reference standard, or "gold standard," should be for  the evaluation of a new test. the present research was initiated to compare the ability of several detection methods, i.e., a serial dilution anaerobic culture and/or microscopic procedure, a dna probe procedure, and immunological reagents using both an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and an indirect immunofluorescence assay to detect treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in subgingival plaque samples taken from 204 periodontally diseased tooth sites. the prevalence  of the four monitored species varied as a function of both the species and the detection method. spirochetes were present in 99% of the plaques, whereas a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected at the lowest frequency. the culture method yielded the lowest prevalence values for the three cultivable species. this raised the question as to which results, those obtained by culture or those obtained by the dna probes and the immunological reagents, were the most reliable. this issue was addressed by looking at the prevalence profile of the monitored organisms, as determined by all the detection methods. if the species was detected by three or four of the detection methods, then it was considered present, whereas if it was absent by three or four of the detection methods, then it was considered absent. this approach showed the dna probes and immunological reagents to be significantly superior (p less than 0.05) to the culture approach  for the detection of p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and b. forsythus and to be comparable to the microscopic approach in the detection of t. denticola.

TI  == comparison of the benzoyl-dl-arginine-naphthylamide (bana) test, dna probes, and  immunological reagents for ability to detect anaerobic periodontal infections due to porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and bacteroides forsythus.
AB  == most forms of periodontal disease are associated with the presence or overgrowth  of anaerobic species that could include treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, and bacteroides forsythus among others. these three organisms are among the few cultivable plaque species that can hydrolyze the synthetic trypsin  substrate benzoyl-dl-arginine-naphthylamide (bana). in turn, bana hydrolysis by the plaque can be associated with periodontal morbidity and with the presence of  these three bana-positive organisms in the plaque. in this investigation, the results of the bana test, which simultaneously detects one or more of these organisms, were compared with the detection of these organisms by (i) highly specific antibodies to p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and b. forsythus; (ii) whole  genomic dna probes to p. gingivalis and t. denticola; and (iii) culturing or microscopic procedures. the bana test, the dna probes, and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or an indirect immunofluorescence assay procedure exhibited high sensitivities, i.e., 90 ot 96%, and high accuracies, i.e., 83 to 92%, in their ability to detect combinations of these organisms in over 200 subgingival plaque samples taken from the most periodontally diseased sites in 67 patients. this indicated that if p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and b. forsythus are appropriate marker organisms for an anaerobic periodontal infection, then the three detection methods are equally accurate in their ability to diagnose this infection. the same statement could not be made for the culturing approach, where accuracies of 50 to 62% were observed.

AB  == the mouths of young children become colonized by a variety of bacteria, but there have been only a few studies that have sought the presence of periodontopathic species in this population. almost all of these studies used culturing techniques rather than the newer detection methodologies for various periodontopathogens. studies in adults have shown that treponema denticola and porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis can be detected in dental plaque by use of the bana and  elisa diagnostic tests. in the present study, plaque samples from four subgingival sites in each of 157 children (aged from two to 18 years) were tested for bana hydrolysis with a bana reagent card, and for t. denticola and p. gingivalis with an elisa assay. anaerobic periodontopathogens hydrolyzing the bana substrate were found to be present in at least one of four plaque samples in 88 children (56%). t. denticola and/or p. gingivalis were detected by elisa in at least one plaque sample in each of 135 children (86%). this study shows that children are widely colonized by these micro-organisms. a higher proportion of black children than caucasian children was colonized by these bana-positive organisms. also, children having a parent with a documented history of periodontal disease were more likely to be bana-positive than were children of parents with unknown periodontal status.

TI  == effects of chlorhexidine on proteolytic and glycosidic enzyme activities of dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == chlorhexidine was tested for its ability to inhibit a wide range of glycosidic and proteolytic enzyme activities produced by treponema denticola, porphyromonas  gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga orchracea, capnocytophaga sp., actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mitior, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sanguis. the enzymes produced by capnocytophaga spp. were the most resistant to inhibition by chlorhexidine while  the hydrolysis of proteolytic substrates by all the other species was markedly susceptible to inhibition with less than 0.125 mm chlorhexidine inhibiting enzyme activities by greater than or equal to 50%. glycosidase activities, of all species, were generally more resistant to inhibition, especially neuraminidase activity. chlorhexidine at less than 0.032 mm inhibited the degradation of bovine serum albumin by suspensions of dental plaque bacteria. these observations support an hypothesis that chlorhexidine exerts a bacteristatic effect in vivo, in part, by reducing the ability of dental plaque bacteria to degrade host-derived proteins and glycoproteins which normally provide essential nutrients for growth.

TI  == [first results with a microbiological quick diagnostic procedure in periodontitis].
AB  == we tested a new diagnostic procedure for the characterization of subgingival plaque in 119 subjects suffering from adult periodontitis. the method can be characterized as a hydrolysis of bana (n-benzoyl-dl-arginine-beta-naphthylamide)  by peptidases of porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus and treponema denticola. the result of a positive will be a more or less blue coloured test paper representing the amount of these three peridontal pathogens into the subgingival plaque. after the periodontal initial therapy the frequency of the positive colour reaction was significantly reduced. a correlation between the colour reaction and the clinical signs of periodontitis as well as the morphological characterization of subgingival plaque by darkfield microscopy could not been found. the new method for the characterization subgingival plaque  seems to be useful for the judgement of a successful periodontal therapy at single sites.

TI  == the utility of the bana test for monitoring anaerobic infections due to spirochetes (treponema denticola) in periodontal disease.
AB  == treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, and bacteroides forsythus each possesses an enzyme(s) that hydrolyzes the synthetic substrate benzoyl-dl-arginine-naphthylamide (bana). the presence of these organisms in a subgingival plaque sample can be determined by the ability of the plaque to hydrolyze bana. in the present study, we describe the usefulness of the bana test at various stages of a clinical trial of the efficacy of metronidazole in the treatment of periodontal disease. a bana-positive test was significantly associated with high levels and proportions of spirochetes in the plaque, so that it provided information comparable with that which could be obtained by a microscopic examination of the plaque. patients with such anaerobic spirochetal infections were randomly assigned to a group receiving either metronidazole or placebo (250 mg, three times a day) for one week and whose teeth were scaled and  root-planed. the advantages of the decision that metronidazole be used were apparent from the comparison with the results obtained in the patients who received only the scaling and root planing. the initially bana-positive teeth in  the patients treated with metronidazole, scaling, and root planing gained attachment and exhibited a significant reduction in the need for periodontal surgery, when compared with the bana-positive teeth in the patients who received  only placebo, scaling, and root planing. after the conclusion of this therapy, those teeth with persistent bana-positive plaques had significantly higher proportions and levels of spirochetes than did the teeth with bana-negative plaques.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == treponema denticola, porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis, and bacteroides forsythus are among the anaerobic species frequently associated with adult forms  of periodontal disease. these organisms hydrolyze the synthetic peptide benzoyl-dl-arginine-naphthylamide (bana), and such enzyme activity can be detected in the plaque and related to clinical disease and the presence of spirochetes. in this investigation, the liquid bana assay was compared with a commercially developed bana assay which employed a paper format and which could be read after a 15-min incubation. in the paper format, strips of a whatman filter paper were impregnated with bana and strips of nitrocellulose paper were impregnated with fast black k salt. both strips were applied lengthwise across a  paper card (3 by 5 in. [7.6 by 12.7 cm]). the bana strip at the bottom was inoculated with the test sample (pure culture, plaque), folded back so that it contacted the fast black strip, and then incubated for 15 min at 55 degrees c. t. denticola, p. gingivalis, and b. forsythus always gave a positive reaction, whereas 51 other plaque species were always negative. six bacteroides and capnocytophaga species on occasion had weak reactions. the proportional agreement between bana positiveness and clinical disease was similar for both the liquid and the paper assays. the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy relative to the  clinical standard of the liquid assay were 74, 76, and 77%, respectively, while those of the paper assay were 81, 78, and 80%, respectively. the paper assay was  significantly associated with the presence of either t. denticola or p. gingivalis or both in the plaque samples, with a sensitivity of 85%, a specificity of 53%, and an accuracy of 79%. these findings indicate that a rapid  paper assay for bana hydrolysis gives data comparable to those obtained with the  liquid bana assay.
