TI  == presence of erythromycin and tetracycline resistance genes in lactic acid bacteria from fermented foods of indian origin.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) resistant to erythromycin were isolated from different food samples on selective media. the isolates were identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus lactis, enterococcus casseliflavus, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc mesenteroides. of the total 60 isolates, 88 % harbored the ermb gene. the efflux gene msra was identified in e. faecium, e. durans, e. lactis, e. casseliflavus, p. pentosaceus  and l. fermentum. further analysis of the msra gene by sequencing suggested its homology to msrc. resistance to tetracycline due to the genes tetm, tetw, teto, tetk and tetl, alone or in combination, were identified in lactobacillus species. the tetracycline efflux genes tetk and tetl occurred in p. pentosaceus and enterococcus species. since it appeared that lab had acquired these genes, fermented foods may be a source of antibiotic resistance.

TI  == genotypic diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from african traditional alkaline-fermented foods.
AB  == aim: to identify and compare lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from alkaline fermentations of cassava (manihot esculenta crantz) leaves, roselle (hibiscus sabdariffa) and african locust bean (parkia biglobosa) seeds for production of, respectively, ntoba mbodi, bikalga and soumbala. methods and results: a total of  121 lab were isolated, identified and compared by phenotyping and genotyping using pcr amplification of 16s-23s rdna intergenic transcribed spacer (its-pcr),  repetitive sequence-based pcr (rep-pcr) and dna sequencing. the results revealed  a diversity of genera, species and subspecies of lab in african alkaline fermentations. the isolates were characterized as nonmotile (in most cases) gram-positive rods, cocci or coccobacilli, catalase and oxidase negative. its-pcr allowed typing mainly at species level, with differentiation of a few bacteria at subspecies level. rep-pcr permitted typing at subspecies level and revealed significant genotypic differences between the same species of bacteria from different raw materials. dna sequencing combined with use of api 50chl and api 20strep systems allowed identification of bacteria as weissella confusa, weissella cibaria, lactobacillus plantarum, pediococcus pentosaceus, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus avium and enterococcus hirae from ntoba mbodi; ent. faecium, ent. hirae and pediococcus acidilactici from bikalga and soumbala. conclusion: lab found in african alkaline-fermented foods belong to a range of genera, species and subspecies of bacteria and vary considerably according to raw material. significance and impact of the study: our study confirms that lab survive in alkaline fermentations, a first crucial stage in determining their significance and possible value as probiotic bacteria.

TI  == microbiological study of lactic acid fermentation of caper berries by molecular and culture-dependent methods.
AB  == fermentation of capers (the fruits of capparis sp.) was studied by molecular and  culture-independent methods. a lactic acid fermentation occurred following immersion of caper berries in water, resulting in fast acidification and development of the organoleptic properties typical of this fermented food. a collection of 133 isolates obtained at different times of fermentation was reduced to 75 after randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis. isolates were identified by pcr or 16s rrna gene sequencing as lactobacillus plantarum (37 isolates), lactobacillus paraplantarum (1 isolate), lactobacillus pentosus (5 isolates), lactobacillus brevis (9 isolates), lactobacillus fermentum (6 isolates), pediococcus pentosaceus (14 isolates), pediococcus acidilactici (1  isolate), and enterococcus faecium (2 isolates). cluster analysis of rapd-pcr patterns revealed a high degree of diversity among lactobacilli (with four major  groups and five subgroups), while pediococci clustered in two closely related groups. a culture-independent analysis of fermentation samples by temporal temperature gradient electrophoresis (ttge) also indicated that l. plantarum is the predominant species in this fermentation, in agreement with culture-dependent results. the distribution of l. brevis and l. fermentum in samples was also determined by ttge, but identification of pediococcus at the species level was not possible. ttge also allowed a more precise estimation of the distribution of  e. faecium, and the detection of enterococcus casseliflavus (which was not revealed by the culture-dependent analysis). results from this study indicate that complementary data from molecular and culture-dependent analysis provide a more accurate determination of the microbial community dynamics during caper fermentation.

TI  == recovery of vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci from pediatric liver transplant recipients.
AB  == between november 1988 and october 1989, 49 first-time pediatric liver transplant  recipients at the children's hospital of pittsburgh were prospectively monitored  for the presence of stool colonization and the development of disease caused by vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci (vrgpc). quantitative stool culturing was done on a weekly basis, and cultures were planted onto a selective medium for vrgpc. isolates for which the mic was greater than or equal to 8 were considered  resistant to vancomycin. patients were monitored clinically for the development of infection, and their charts were systematically reviewed for the use of antibiotics. eighty-six isolates were recovered from 36 of the 49 patients. enterococcal species were isolated from 31 patients and included enterococcus gallinarum (n = 28), e. casseliflavus (n = 14), e. faecium (n = 9), e. faecalis (n = 2), e. mundtii (n = 2), and e. durans (n = 1). stool colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci was noted to increase steadily during the first  month after transplantation. only 9 of 31 patients demonstrated clearance of these organisms in serial repeat cultures. additional isolates of vrgpc included  lactobacillus confusus (n = 13), lactobacillus spp. (n = 12), and pediococcus pentosaceus (n = 4). infection due to vrgpc developed in three patients: a urinary tract infection in two and peritonitis in one. e. faecium was the pathogen in each of these cases. the ranges of mics of vancomycin were 8 to 32 micrograms/ml for all enterococcal isolates and greater than 128 micrograms/ml for lactobacillus and pediococcus isolates. all lactobacillus and pediococcus isolates were resistant to teicoplanin, although they were susceptible to daptomycin. all other isolates were susceptible to both teicoplanin and daptomycin. this study demonstrates that stool colonization with vrgpc may be a common and early finding among pediatric liver transplant recipients. however, infection appears to be uncommon.
