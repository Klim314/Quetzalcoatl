TI  - The expression of propionicin PLG-1 gene (plg-1) by lactic starters.
AB  - Propionicin PLG-1 is a bacteriocin produced by Propionibacterium thoenii P127. Such bacteriocin inhibits wide range of food-borne pathogens such as pathogenic Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Yersinia enterocolitica and a strain of Corynebacterium sp. In the present study, plg-1 gene expressing propionicin PLG-1 was isolated, sequenced for the first time and the resulting sequence was analysed using several web-based bioinformatics programs. The PCR product containing plg-1 gene was transferred to different lactic acid bacterial (LAB) strains using pLEB590 as a cloning vector to give the modified vector pLEBPLG-1. LAB transformants showed an antimicrobial activity against Esch. coli DH5alpha (most affected strain), Listeria monocytogenes 18116, and Salmonella enterica 25566 as model pathogenic strains. Such LAB transformants can be used in dairy industry to control the food-borne pathogens that are largely distributed worldwide and to feed schoolchildren in the poor countries where dangerous epidemic diseases and diarrhoea prevail.
TI  - Expanding the results of a high throughput screen against an isochorismate-pyruvate lyase to enzymes of a similar scaffold or mechanism.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance is a growing health concern, and new avenues of antimicrobial drug design are being actively sought. One suggested pathway to be targeted for inhibitor design is that of iron scavenging through siderophores. Here we present a high throughput screen to the isochorismate-pyruvate lyase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an enzyme required for the production of the siderophore pyochelin. Compounds identified in the screen are high nanomolar to low micromolar inhibitors of the enzyme and produce growth inhibition in PAO1 P. aeruginosa in the millimolar range under iron-limiting conditions. The identified compounds were also tested for enzymatic inhibition of Escherichia coli chorismate mutase, a protein of similar fold and similar chemistry, and of Yersinia enterocolitica salicylate synthase, a protein of differing fold but catalyzing the same lyase reaction. In both cases, subsets of the inhibitors from the screen were found to be inhibitory to enzymatic activity (mutase or synthase) in the micromolar range and capable of growth inhibition in their respective organisms (E. coli or Y. enterocolitica).
TI  - Development of 23 individual TaqMan(R) real-time PCR assays for identifying common foodborne pathogens using a single set of amplification conditions.
AB  - Most of the acute intestinal diseases are caused by foodborne pathogens with infants and elderly people being at major risk. The aim of this study was to develop a procedure to simultaneously detect 20 foodborne pathogens in complex alimentary matrices such as milk, cheese and meat. The list of targets include, among the others, Listeria spp., Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Escherichia coli spp., Campylobacter spp., Clostridium spp. and Staphylococcus aureus. The accuracy of detection was determined by using ATCC strains as positive and negative controls. The achieved sensitivity of each of assays was 1 pg of genomic DNA, which was equivalent to approximately 1 cfu. The working ranges of the TaqMan((R)) Real-time PCR assays, when used quantitatively on cheese and meat samples inoculated with serial dilution of Listeria spp., Listeria monocytogenes, S. aureus, Salmonella enterica, Shigella boydii, E. coli O157:H7, Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Enterobacter sakazakii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 10(8) cfu/g to 10(4) cfu/g. No matrix interferences were observed.
TI  - Green conversion of agroindustrial wastes into chitin and chitosan by Rhizopus arrhizus and Cunninghamella elegans strains.
AB  - This article sets out a method for producing chitin and chitosan by Cunninghamella elegans and Rhizopus arrhizus strains using a green metabolic conversion of agroindustrial wastes (corn steep liquor and molasses). The physicochemical characteristics of the biopolymers and antimicrobial activity are described. Chitin and chitosan were extracted by alkali-acid treatment, and characterized by infrared spectroscopy, viscosity and X-ray diffraction. The effectiveness of chitosan from C. elegans and R. arrhizus in inhibiting the growth of Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli and Yersinia enterocolitica were evaluated by determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC). The highest production of biomass (24.60 g/L), chitin (83.20 mg/g) and chitosan (49.31 mg/g) was obtained by R. arrhizus. Chitin and chitosan from both fungi showed a similar degree of deacetylation, respectively of 25% and 82%, crystallinity indices of 33.80% and 32.80% for chitin, and 20.30% and 17.80% for chitosan. Both chitin and chitosan presented similar viscosimetry of 3.79-3.40 cP and low molecular weight of 5.08x10(3) and 4.68x10(3) g/mol. They both showed identical MIC and MBC for all bacteria assayed. These results suggest that: agricultural wastes can be produced in an environmentally friendly way; chitin and chitosan can be produced economically; and that chitosan has antimicrobial potential against pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Lysine221 is the general base residue of the isochorismate synthase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PchA) in a reaction that is diffusion limited.
AB  - The isochorismate synthase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PchA) catalyzes the conversion of chorismate to isochorismate, which is subsequently converted by a second enzyme (PchB) to salicylate for incorporation into the salicylate-capped siderophore pyochelin. PchA is a member of the MST family of enzymes, which includes the structurally homologous isochorismate synthases from Escherichia coli (EntC and MenF) and salicylate synthases from Yersinia enterocolitica (Irp9) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MbtI). The latter enzymes generate isochorismate as an intermediate before generating salicylate and pyruvate. General acid-general base catalysis has been proposed for isochorismate synthesis in all five enzymes, but the residues required for the isomerization are a matter of debate, with both lysine221 and glutamate313 proposed as the general base (PchA numbering). This work includes a classical characterization of PchA with steady state kinetic analysis, solvent kinetic isotope effect analysis and by measuring the effect of viscosogens on catalysis. The results suggest that isochorismate production from chorismate by the MST enzymes is the result of general acid-general base catalysis with a lysine as the base and a glutamic acid as the acid, in reverse protonation states. Chemistry is determined to not be rate limiting, favoring the hypothesis of a conformational or binding step as the slow step.
TI  - Biosynthesis of UDP-GlcNAc, UndPP-GlcNAc and UDP-GlcNAcA involves three easily distinguished 4-epimerase enzymes, Gne, Gnu and GnaB.
AB  - We have undertaken an extensive survey of a group of epimerases originally named  Gne, that were thought to be responsible for inter-conversion of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) and UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine (UDP-GalNAc). The analysis builds on recent work clarifying the specificity of some of these epimerases. We find three well defined clades responsible for inter-conversion of the gluco- and galacto-configuration at C4 of different N-acetylhexosamines. Their major biological roles are the formation of UDP-GalNAc, UDP-N-acetylgalactosaminuronic acid (UDP-GalNAcA) and undecaprenyl pyrophosphate-N-acetylgalactosamine (UndPP-GalNAc) from the corresponding glucose forms. We propose that the clade of UDP-GlcNAcA epimerase genes be named gnaB and the clade of UndPP-GlcNAc epimerase genes be named gnu, while the UDP-GlcNAc epimerase genes retain the name gne. The Gne epimerases, as now defined after exclusion of those to be named GnaB or Gnu, are in the same clade as the GalE 4-epimerases for inter-conversion of UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) and UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal). This work brings clarity to an area that had become quite confusing. The identification of distinct enzymes for epimerisation of UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-GlcNAcA and UndPP-GlcNAc will greatly facilitate allocation of gene function in polysaccharide gene clusters, including those found in bacterial genome sequences. A table of the accession numbers for the 295 proteins used in the analysis is provided to enable the major tree to be regenerated with the inclusion of additional proteins of interest. This and other suggestions for annotation of 4-epimerase genes will facilitate annotation.
TI  - Synergistic effect between colistin and bacteriocins in controlling Gram-negative pathogens and their potential to reduce antibiotic toxicity in mammalian epithelial cells.
AB  - Pathogens resistant to most conventional antibiotics are a harbinger of the need  to discover novel antimicrobials and anti-infective agents and develop innovative strategies to combat them. The aim of this study was to assess the in vitro activity of colistin alone or in combination with two bacteriocins, nisin A and pediocin PA-1/AcH, against Salmonella choleraesuis ATCC 14028, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Yersinia enterocolitica ATCC 9610, and Escherichia coli ATCC 35150 (O157:H7). The strain most sensitive to colistin was enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7, which was inhibited at a concentration of about 0.12 mug/ml. When nisin A (1.70 mug/ml) or pediocin PA-1/AcH (1.56 mug/ml) was combined with colistin, the concentrations required to inhibit E. coli O157:H7 were 0.01 and 0.03 mug/ml, respectively. The in vitro antigenotoxic effect of colistin was determined by using the comet assay method to measure the level of DNA damage in freshly isolated human peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) incubated with colistin for 1 h at 37 degrees C. Changes in the tail extents of PBLs of about 69.29 +/- 0.08 mum were observed at a final colistin concentration of about 550 ng/ml. Besides the synergistic effect, the combination of colistin (1 mg/ml) and nisin (2 mg/ml) permitted us to re-evaluate the toxic effect of colistin on Vero (monkey kidney epithelial) cells.
TI  - Rapid detection and respirometric profiling of aerobic bacteria on panels of selective media.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate high-throughput optical oxygen microrespirometry for selective  detection and predictive identification of aerobic bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using GreenLight probe, standard 384-well plates and time-resolved fluorescence reader, a representative panel of 16 partially selective media and 9 aerobic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes, Salmonella typhimurium and Listeria innocua) were analysed. For each medium, bacterial strain and dilution, growth profiles were recorded, from which calibrations, doubling/generation times and growth patterns in different media were determined. Analytical performance, selectivity and general usability of the method were assessed, and mixed bacterial cultures were analysed. CONCLUSION: The microrespirometry platform facilitates simple, real-time detection and predictive identification of aerobic bacteria by looking at the patterns of their growth and respiration in several media and determining their growth and doubling times. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The new screening method can be used for routine microbiological analysis and testing of aerobic bacterial cultures as well as complex food, environmental and clinical samples.
TI  - Two structures of a thiazolinyl imine reductase from Yersinia enterocolitica provide insight into catalysis and binding to the nonribosomal peptide synthetase module of HMWP1.
AB  - The thiazolinyl imine reductase from Yersinia enterocolitica (Irp3) catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of a thiazoline ring in an intermediate for the formation of the siderophore yersiniabactin. Two structures of Irp3 were determined in the apo (1.85 A) and NADP(+)-bound (2.31 A) forms. Irp3 is structurally homologous to sugar oxidoreductases such as glucose-fructose oxidoreductase and 1,5-anhydro-d-fructose reductase, as well as to biliverdin reductase. A homology model of the thiazolinyl imine reductase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PchG) was generated. Extensive loop insertions are observed in the C-terminal domain that are unique to Irp3 and PchG and not found in the structural homologues that recognize small molecular substrates. These loops are hypothesized to be important for binding of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase modules (found in HMWP1 and PchF, respectively) to which the substrate of the reductase is covalently attached. A catalytic mechanism for the donation of a proton from a general acid (either histidine 101 or tyrosine 128) and the donation of a hydride from C4 of nicotinamide of the NADPH cofactor is proposed for reduction of the carbon-nitrogen double bond of the thiazoline.
TI  - Emergence and stability of high-pressure resistance in different food-borne pathogens.
AB  - High hydrostatic pressure (HHP) processing is becoming a valuable nonthermal food pasteurization technique, although there is reasonable concern that bacterial HHP resistance could compromise the safety and stability of HHP-processed foods. While the degree of natural HHP resistance has already been shown to vary greatly among and within bacterial species, a still unresolved question remains as to what extent different food-borne pathogens can actually develop HHP resistance. In this study, we therefore examined and compared the intrinsic potentials for HHP resistance development among strains of Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella enterica serovars Typhimurium and Enteritidis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Listeria innocua using a selective enrichment approach. Interestingly, of all strains examined, the acquisition of extreme HHP resistance could be detected in only some of the E. coli strains, indicating that a specific genetic predisposition might be required for resistance development. Furthermore, once acquired, HHP resistance proved to be a very stable trait that was maintained for >80 generations in the absence of HHP exposure. Finally, at the mechanistic level, HHP resistance was not necessarily linked to derepression of the heat shock genes and was not related to the phenomenon of persistence.
TI  - Label-free detection of a bacterial pathogen using an immobilized siderophore, deferoxamine.
AB  - Pathogenic bacteria obtain the iron necessary for survival by releasing an iron chelator, termed a siderophore, and retrieving the iron-siderophore complex via a cell surface siderophore receptor. We have exploited the high affinity of Yersinia enterocolitica for its siderophore, deferoxamine, to develop a rapid method for capture and identification of Yersinia. In this methodology, a deferoxamine-bovine serum albumin conjugate is printed onto a gold-plated chip in a parallel line pattern. After flowing a suspension of Yersinia across the siderophore-derivatized chip, any Yersinia that binds to the chip is detected by dark-field microscopy analysis of the scattered light, followed by Fourier transform analysis of the scattering pattern. Since peak intensities are found to correlate with pathogen concentration, pathogen titers as low as 10(3) cfu/ml can be readily detected. Moreover, immobilized deferoxamine can distinguish Y. enterocolitica, which binds ferrioxamine (deferoxamine-Fe), from Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium smegmatis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which don't. Because human pathogens cannot easily mutate their iron retrieval systems without loss of viability, we suggest that few if any mutant Yersinia will emerge that can avoid detection. Together with previous results demonstrating selective capture of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by its immobilized siderophore (pyoverdin), these data suggest that pathogen-specific siderophores may constitute effective and immutable capture ligands for rapid detection and identification of their cognate pathogens.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 produced by Enterococcus faecium strain LWP760].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 (enterocin) produced by Enterococcusfaecium strain LWP760 was studied. Bacteriocin S760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kDa and pl of 9.8. Enterocin S760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. MICs of the bacteriocin S760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for Escherichia coli 0157:H117, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Corynebacterium diphteriae. It is also active against antibioticresistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter baumannii (with MICs of 0.05-3 mg/l), Klebsiella pneumoniae (with MICs of 6 mg/l), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of Candida albicans, Candida krusei and Aspergillus niger (with MICs of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). Enterocin S760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.
TI  - Antioxidant, electrochemical, thermal, antimicrobial and alkane oxidation properties of tridentate Schiff base ligands and their metal complexes.
AB  - In this study, two Schiff base ligands (HL(1) and HL(2)) and their Cu(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Pd(II) and Ru(III) metal complexes were synthesized and characterized by the analytical and spectroscopic methods. Alkane oxidation activities of the metal complexes were studied on cyclohexane as substrate. The ligands and their metal complexes were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against Corynebacterium xerosis, Bacillus brevis, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus cereus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Enterococcus faecalis (as gram-positive bacteria) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Klebsiella fragilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Candida albicans (as gram-negative bacteria). The antioxidant properties of the Schiff base ligands were evaluated in a series of in vitro tests: 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging and reducing power activity of superoxide anion radical generated non-enzymatic systems. Electrochemical and thermal properties of the compounds were investigated.
TI  - Modulation of connexin signaling by bacterial pathogens and their toxins.
AB  - Inherent to their pivotal tasks in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, gap junctions, connexin hemichannels, and pannexin hemichannels are frequently involved in the dysregulation of this critical balance. The present paper specifically focuses on their roles in bacterial infection and disease. In particular, the reported biological outcome of clinically important bacteria including Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Yersinia enterocolitica, Helicobacter pylori, Bordetella pertussis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter rodentium, Clostridium species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus and their toxic products on connexin- and pannexin-related signaling in host cells is reviewed. Particular attention is paid to the underlying molecular mechanisms of these effects as well as to the actual biological relevance of these findings.
TI  - Growth of Salmonella enteritidis and Salmonella typhimurium in the presence of quorum sensing signalling compounds produced by spoilage and pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The effect of acylated homoserine lactones (AHLs) and autoinducer-2 (AI-2) signalling compounds present in the cell-free culture supernatants (CFS), of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia enterocolitica-like GTE 112, Serratia proteamaculans 00612, Y. enterocolitica CITY650 and Y. enterocolitica CITY844, on the growth of two Salmonella Enteritidis and two S. Typhimurium strains was assessed though monitoring of changes in conductance of the medium. Detection times (T(det)), area and slope of conductance curves were recorded. Except for P. aeruginosa 108928, which was not found to produce AI-2, all other strains produced both AHLs and AI-2. Thereafter, aliquots (20% in the final volume) of these CFS were transferred into NZ Amine broth inoculated with ca. 10(3) CFU/ml of stationary phase cultures of each Salmonella strain. While the CFS of P. aeruginosa induced a shorter detection time, i.e. acceleration of the metabolic activity, the CFS of the other microorganisms increased the detection time of Salmonella strains compared to control samples (i.e. without CFS). Results indicate that the growth of Salmonella may be affected by the presence of Quorum sensing (QS) signalling compounds and/or other novel signals existing in CFS, produced by other bacterial species and confirm the complexity of bacterial communication.
TI  - Volatile compounds and bioactivity of Eremurus spectabilis (Ciris), a Turkish wild edible vegetable.
AB  - Eremurus spectabilis grows in the spring as a wild vegetable and for many years has been used both as a food or food additive and for therapeutic purposes. This study investigated the total phenolic content and the antimicrobial, antioxidant, and antiradical activities of methanol, ethanol, and aqueous extracts of E. spectabilis (obtained from the Antalya region of Turkey). In addition, volatile compounds of E. spectabilis were characterized by using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Major components of E. spectabilis volatile compounds were carvone (44.64%), carvacrol (14.45%), pentane, 2-methyl- (7.34%), (E)-caryophyllene (5.57%), valencene (5.11%), cis-calamenene (2.01%), cadalene (1.10%), and acetic acid (1.12%). The highest total phenolic content was seen with methanol extract (mean+/-standard deviation, 31.92 +/- 0.48 mg gallic acid equivalents/g dry extract). The ethanol extract showed the highest antiradical activity, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 35.14 mug/L in the 1,1-diphenyl-2- picrylhydrazyl assay. The strongest antioxidant activity was detected in methanol extract (81.72 +/- 0.62 mg ascorbic acid equivalents/g). Twelve bacteria species were used to analyze the antimicrobial activity of extracts. The 1% concentrations of all extracts showed no inhibitive effect on any bacterium. The most resistant bacterium was Yersinia enterocolitica, and the most sensitive bacterium was Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A positive correlation was seen between concentrations and inhibition zones, and some differences occurred between antimicrobial activity of other concentrations.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the enniatin B, produced by Fusarium tricinctum in liquid culture, and cytotoxic effects on Caco-2 cells.
AB  - The enniatins (ENs) are bioactive compounds of hexadepsipeptidic structure produced by several strains of Fusarium sp. The EN B was purified from extracts of Fusarium tricinctum growth on liquid culture of potato dextrose broth (PDB), using a semipreparative liquid chromatography (LC) followed by an analytical LC. The purity and the structure of the isolated compound were confirmed by the determination of the extinction coefficient and with electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) study. The pure fraction of EN B was utilized to determine the antibiotic effects on several bacterial strains that are considered normally pathogens of the intestinal tract: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Salmonella enterica, Shigella dysenteriae, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus, and to study the cytotoxic effects on Caco-2 differentiated and undifferentiated cells. The results obtained demonstrated that in several antibiograms, EN B induced the inhibition of the grown microorganisms tested and no significant differences over control were detected when Caco-2 cells were exposed to EN B, at any of the concentrations used.
TI  - Development of a DNA microarray for detection and identification of Legionella pneumophila and ten other pathogens in drinking water.
AB  - The safety and accessibility of drinking water are major concerns throughout the  world. Consumption of water contaminated with infectious agents, toxic chemicals or radiological hazards represents a significant health risk and is strongly associated with mortality. Therefore, we have developed an oligonucleotide-based microarray using the sequences of 16S-23S rDNA internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS) and the gyrase subunit B gene (gyrB) found in the most prevalent and devastating waterborne pathogenic agents. This new diagnostic contains 26 specific probes and can simultaneously detect Aeromonas hydrophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio choleraeo, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Yersinia enterocolitica and Leptospira interrogans. Testing was carried out against a total of 218 bacterial strains, including 53 representative strains, 103 clinical isolates and 62 strains of other bacterial species belonging to 10 genera and 48 species. The results were specific and reproducible, with a detection sensitivity of 0.1 ng DNA or 10(4)CFU/ml achieved for pure cultures of each target organism. The diluted cultures and real drinking water samples were tested by the microarray with 100% accuracy. This novel diagnostic method is superior in time- and labor-efficiency to conventional bacterial culture and antiserum agglutination, and can be readily applied to epidemiological surveillance and other food safety applications.
TI  - Effect of neem extract against the bacteria isolated from marine fish.
AB  - Marine ornamental fishes are exceedingly valuable due to their high demand in domestic and international markets. There is a growing global interest to rear the fishes in captivity. But problem due to bacteria and fungi are the major hitch in captive condition. Since, the use of antibiotics is banned, an attempt was made to ascertain in vitro assay of the neem leaves extract against the bacterial pathogens isolated from infected fishes. Bacterial strains isolated from infected regions of the clown fishes Amphiprion sebae and A. ocellaris were identified as Aeromonas hydrophila, Enterobacter sp., E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus sp., Streptococcus sp., Vibrio cholerae, V. alginolyticus, V. parahaemolyticus and Yersinia enterocolitica. Ethanol and methanol extracts were highly inhibitory to the bacterial isolates when compared to other solvents. Ethanol extracts exhibited low minimum inhibitory concentration (75-250 microg ml(-1)) as compared to other extracts. The present finding revealed that the neem leaf extract significantly reduces the bacterial pathogens and their infection in marine ornamental fishes.
TI  - Structure of the metal-dependent deacetylase LpxC from Yersinia enterocolitica complexed with the potent inhibitor CHIR-090 .
AB  - The first committed step of lipid A biosynthesis is catalyzed by UDP-(3-O-((R)-3-hydroxymyristoyl))-N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase, a metal-dependent deacetylase also known as LpxC. Because lipid A is essential for bacterial viability, the inhibition of LpxC is an appealing therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Gram-negative bacterial infections. Here we report the 1.79 A resolution X-ray crystal structure of LpxC from Yersinia enterocolitica (YeLpxC) complexed with the potent hydroxamate inhibitor CHIR-090. This enzyme is a nearly identical orthologue of LpxC from Yersinia pestis (99.7% sequence identity), the pathogen that causes bubonic plague. Similar to the inhibition of LpxC from Escherichia coli, CHIR-090 inhibits YeLpxC via a two-step slow, tight-binding mechanism with an apparent K(i) of 0.54 +/- 0.14 nM followed by conversion of the E.I to E.I* species with a rate constant of 0.11 +/- 0.01 min(-1). The structure of the LpxC complex with CHIR-090 shows that the inhibitor hydroxamate group chelates the active site zinc ion, and the "tail" of the inhibitor binds in the hydrophobic tunnel in the active site. This hydrophobic tunnel is framed by a betaalphabeta subdomain that exhibits significant conformational flexibility as it accommodates inhibitor binding. CHIR-090 displays a 27 mm zone of inhibition against Y. enterocolitica in a Kirby-Bauer antibiotic assay, which is comparable to its reported activity against other Gram-negative species including E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This study demonstrates that the inhibition of LpxC should be explored as a potential therapeutic and/or prophylatic response to infection by weaponized Yersinia species.
TI  - The post-antibiotic effect of manuka honey on gastrointestinal pathogens.
AB  
TI  - Sanitizing effect of salts on experimentally inoculated organisms on pork carcasses.
AB  - Pork forequarters procured from freshly slaughtered animals were decontaminated with hot water and inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica, Listeria monocytogenes, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteusvulgaris. The forequarters were individually spray washed with 5% potassium sorbate and a combination of 5% sodium chloride and 2.5% each of sodium acetate, sodium citrate, sodium lactate and potassium sorbate solutions. The total viable count (TVC) of the treated meat samples was reduced by 0.96 and 1.31 log units by spraying with salt and salt combination respectively with marginal changes in colour and odour scores. Inoculated organisms were found to be highly sensitive to salt combination treatment as compared to potassium sorbate alone. Shelf-life of salt and salt combination treated samples was increased to 8 and 11days as against 4days in untreated samples. Carcass washing with salt and salt combination was found to be suitable for extension of shelf-life and improvement in the sensory and microbiological quality of meat.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of the bioactive compound beauvericin produced by Fusarium proliferatum on solid medium of wheat.
AB  - To obtain the bioactive compound beauvericin (BEA), Fusarium proliferatum CECT 20569 was grown on a solid medium of wheat, utilizing the technique of the solid state fermentation (SSF), being this mycotoxin purified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a reverse phase semi-preparative column using as the mobile phase acetonitrile/water in gradient condition. The purity of the BEA was verified by analytical HPLC and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS). The pure fractions of BEA were utilized to determinate the antibiotic effects on several bacterial strains that are considered normally pathogens of the intestinal tract as: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Salmonella enterica, Shigella dysenteriae, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Artemisia nilagirica leaf extracts against clinical and phytopathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The six organic solvent extracts of Artemisia nilagirica were screened for the potential antimicrobial activity against phytopathogens and clinically important standard reference bacterial strains. METHODS: The agar disk diffusion method was used to study the antibacterial activity of A. nilagirica extracts against 15 bacterial strains. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the plant extracts were tested using two fold agar dilution method at concentrations ranging from 32 to 512 microg/ml. The phytochemical screening of extracts was carried out for major phytochemical derivatives in A. nilagirica. RESULTS: All the extracts showed inhibitory activity for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria except for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. The hexane extract was found to be effective against all phytopathogens with low MIC of 32 microg/ml and the methanol extract exhibited a higher inhibition activity against Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella typhi, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (32 microg/ml), Bacillus subtilis (64 microg/ml) and Shigella flaxneri (128 microg/ml). The phytochemical screening of extracts answered for the major derivative of alkaloids, amino acids, flavonoids, phenol, quinines, tannins and terpenoids. CONCLUSION: All the extracts showed antibacterial activity against the tested strains. Of all, methanol and hexane extracts showed high inhibition against clinical and phytopathogens, respectively. The results also indicate the presence of major phytochemical derivatives in the A. nilagirica extracts. Hence, the isolation and purification of therapeutic potential compounds from A. nilagirica could be used as an effective source against bacterial diseases in human and plants.
TI  - Bacterial toxins induce sustained mRNA expression of the silencing transcription  factor klf2 via inactivation of RhoA and Rhophilin 1.
AB  - Yersiniae bearing the Yersinia virulence plasmid pYV impact the transcriptome of  J774A.1 macrophage-like cells in two distinct ways: (i) by suppressing, in a Yersinia outer protein P (YopP)-dependent manner, the induction of inflammatory response genes and (ii) by mRNA induction of the silencing transcription factor klf2. Here we show that klf2 induction by Yersinia enterocolitica occurs in several cell lines of macrophage and squamous and upper gastrointestinal epithelial origin as well as in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. Several strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are equally effective as Y. enterocolitica in inducing klf2 expression. Screening of mutant strains or incubation with recombinant toxins identified the rho-inactivating toxins YopT from Yersinia spp., ExoS from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, EDIN-B from Staphylococcus aureus, and C3bot from Clostridium botulinum as bacterial inducers of klf2 mRNA. klf2 mRNA induction by these toxins does not require de novo protein synthesis. Serum response factor or actin depolymerization does not seem to be involved in regulating klf2 expression in response to bacterial infection. Instead, short hairpin RNA-mediated inactivation of RhoA and its effector rhophilin 1 is sufficient to induce long-term klf2 expression. Thus, bacteria exploit the RhoA-rhophilin signaling cascade to mediate sustained expression of the immunosuppressive transcription factor klf2.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of blood and blood components in three major blood transfusion centers, Accra, Ghana.
AB  - Reports from studies conducted in several countries indicate a high incidence of  bacterial contamination of donor blood. The prevalence of bacterial contamination of blood and its products in Ghana is not known. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of bacterial contamination of blood and its products at the three major blood transfusion centers in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana. Stored whole blood and its products were cultured on different media, and isolates were identified using standard biochemical and bacteriological methods. The susceptibility of the isolates to selected antimicrobial agents was also determined by the disc diffusion method. The overall prevalence rate was 9% (28/303; whole blood, 13% [24/192]; plasma, 3% [2/79]; platelet, 9% [2/22]). The Gram-positive bacteria isolated were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, S. aureus, and Bacillus spp., and the Gram-negative organisms were Yersinia enterocolitica, Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The Gram-positive bacteria were sensitive to cloxacillin, erythromycin, tetracycline, and gentamicin but resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, cefuroxime, and cotrimoxazole, while the Gram-negative bacteria were sensitive to amikacin and gentamicin but resistant to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime (except Y. enterocolitica), and cotrimoxazole. Our results suggest that bacterial contamination of blood and its products is prevalent in Ghana.
TI  - Cationic compounds with activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria: interest of a new compound compared with two older antiseptics, hexamidine and chlorhexidine.
AB  - Use of antiseptics and disinfectants is essential in infection control practices  in hospital and other healthcare settings. In this study, the in vitro activity of a new promising compound, para-guanidinoethylcalix[4]arene (Cx1), has been evaluated in comparison with hexamidine (HX) and chlorhexidine (CHX), two older cationic antiseptics. The MICs for 69 clinical isolates comprising methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (with or without mecA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci, Enterobacteriaceae producing various beta-lactamases and non-fermenting bacilli (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumanii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) were determined. Cx1 showed similar activity against S. aureus, CoNS and Enterococcus spp., irrespective of the presence of mecA or van genes, or associated resistance genes, with very good activity against CoNS (MIC <1 mg/L). Variable activities were observed against Enterobacteriaceae; the MICs determined seemed to be dependent both on the genus (MICs of 2, 8 and 64 mg/L for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Yersinia enterocolitica, respectively) and on the resistance phenotype production of [Extended Spectrum beta-Lactase (ESBLs) or other beta-lactamases; overproduction of AmpC]. Poor activity was found against non-fermenting bacilli, irrespective of the resistance phenotype. CHX appeared to be the most active compound against all strains, with broad-spectrum and conserved activity against multidrug-resistant strains. HX showed a lower activity, essentially against Gram-positive strains. Consequently, the differences observed with respect to Cx1 suggest that they are certainly not the consequence of antibiotic resistance phenotypes, but rather the result of membrane composition modifications (e.g. of lipopolysaccharide), or of the presence of (activated) efflux-pumps. These results raise the possibility that Cx1 may be a potent new antibacterial agent of somewhat lower activity but significantly lower toxicity than CHX.
TI  - Pleiotropic effect of tatC mutation on metabolism of pathogen Yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the impact of depletion of the twin arginine translocation  (TAT) system on virulence and physiology of Yersinia enterocolitica for a better understanding of its pathogenicity. METHODS: We constructed a DeltatatC::SpR mutant of Yersinia enterocolitica by P1 phage mediated transduction using Escherichia coli K-12 DeltatatC::SpR strain as a donor. RESULTS: A P1-mediated genetic material transfer was found between the two species of enterobacteria, indicating a great potential of acquisition of antibiotic resistance in emergency of a new threatening pathogen by genetic material exchanges. Periplasmic trimethylamine N-oxidase reductase activity was detected in the wild type Y. enterocolitica strain and translocation of this enzyme was completely abolished by the DeltatatC::SpR mutation. In addition, the DeltatatC::SpR mutation showed a pleiotropic effect on the metabolism of Y. enterocolitica. However, the tat mutation did not seem to affect the mobility and virulence of Y. enterocolitica under the conditions used. CONCLUSION: Unlike other pathogenic bacteria studied, the TAT system of Y. enterocolitica might play an important role in the pathogenic process, which is distinct from other pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7.
TI  - Presence of quorum-sensing systems associated with multidrug resistance and biofilm formation in Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - Bacteroides fragilis constitutes 1-2% of the natural microbiota of the human digestive tract and is the predominant anaerobic opportunistic pathogen in gastrointestinal infections. Most bacteria use quorum sensing (QS) to monitor cell density in relation to other cells and their environment. In Gram-negative bacteria, the LuxRI system is common. The luxR gene encodes a transcriptional activator inducible by type I acyl-homoserine lactone autoinducers (e.g., N-[3-oxohexanoyl] homoserine lactone and hexanoyl homoserine lactone [C6-HSL]). This study investigated the presence of QS system(s) in B. fragilis. The genome of American-type culture collection strain no. ATCC25285 was searched for QS genes. The strain was grown to late exponential phase in the presence or absence of synthetic C6-HSL and C8-HSL or natural homoserine lactones from cell-free supernatants from spent growth cultures of other bacteria. Growth, susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, efflux pump gene (bmeB) expression, and biofilm formation were measured. Nine luxR and no luxI orthologues were found. C6-HSL and supernatants from Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio cholerae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa caused a significant (1) reduction in cellular density and (2) increases in expression of four putative luxR genes, bmeB3, bmeB6, bmeB7, and bmeB10, resistance to various antibiotics, which was reduced by carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP, an uncoupler that dissipates the transmembrane proton gradient, which is also the driving force of resistance nodulation division efflux pumps) and (3) increase in biofilm formation. Susceptibility of ATCC25285 to C6-HSL was also reduced by CCCP. These data suggest that (1) B. fragilis contains putative luxR orthologues, which could respond to exogenous homoserine lactones and modulate biofilm formation, bmeB efflux pump expression, and susceptibility to antibiotics, and (2) BmeB efflux pumps could transport homoserine lactones.
TI  - Isolation and purification of enterocin E-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Strain NRRL B-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecium, or Enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as antagonistic to Campylobacter jejuni. The isolate produced a 5,362-Da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, S. enterica serovar Choleraesuis, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, S. enterica serovar Gallinarum, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Yersinia enterocolitica, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, and 20 other Campylobacter species isolates. The enterocin, E-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. The proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin E-760 was demonstrated upon treatment with various proteolytic enzymes. Specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase K, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. The enterocin demonstrated thermostability by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees C and was stable at pH values between 5.0 and 8.7. However, activity was lost below pH 3.0 and above pH 9.5. Administration of enterocin E-760-treated feed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized with two strains of C. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) CFU. Enterocin E-760 also significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired Campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of extracts of the lichen Parmelia sulcata and its salazinic acid constituent.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of the acetone, chloroform, diethyl ether, methanol, and petroleum ether extracts of the lichen Parmelia sulcata and its salazinic acid constituent have been screened against twenty eight food-borne bacteria and fungi. All of the extracts with the exception of the petroleum ether extract showed antimicrobial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Yersinia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Penicillium notatum. Salazinic acid did not show antimicrobial activity against L. monocytogenes, P. vulgaris, Y. enterocolitica, and S. faecalis but showed activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium as well. The MIC values of the extracts and the acid for the bacteria and fungi have also been determined.
TI  - Development of flexible antimicrobial films using essential oils as active agents.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity in the vapor-phase of laboratory-made flexible films of polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene/ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (PE/EVOH) incorporating essential oil of cinnamon ( Cinnamomum zeylanicum), oregano ( Origanum vulgare), clove ( Syzygium aromaticum), or cinnamon fortified with cinnamaldehyde was evaluated against a wide range of microorganisms: the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella choleraesuis; the Gram-positive bacteria Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecalis; the molds Penicillium islandicum, Penicillium roqueforti, Penicillium nalgiovense, Eurotium repens, and A spergillus flavus and the yeasts Candida albicans, Debaryomyces hansenii, and Zigosaccharomyces rouxii. Films with a nominal concentration of 4% (w/w) of fortified cinnamon or oregano essential oil completely inhibited the growth of the fungi; higher concentrations were required to inhibit the Gram-positive bacteria (8 and 10%, respectively), and higher concentrations still were necessary to inhibit the Gram-negative bacteria. PP films were more effective than PE/EVOH films. The atmospheres generated by the antimicrobial films inside Petri dishes were quantitatively analyzed using headspace-single drop microextraction (HS-SDME) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The analyses showed that the oregano-fortified PP films released higher levels of carvacrol and thymol, and the cinnamon-fortified PP films released higher levels of cinnamaldehyde, during the first 3-6 h of incubation, than the corresponding PE/EVOH films. Shelf-life tests were also performed, demonstrating that the antifungal activities of the films persisted for more than two months after their manufacture. In addition, migration tests (overall and specific) were performed, using both aqueous and fatty simulants, to ensure that the films meet EU regulations regarding food contact materials. Following contact with the tested films, the substances that had migrated into the aqueous simulants were recovered by direct immersion-single drop extraction (DI-SDME) and then analyzed by GC-MS. The fatty stimulant (isooctane) was directly injected into the chromatographic system.
TI  - Bacteria induce CTGF and CYR61 expression in epithelial cells in a lysophosphatidic acid receptor-dependent manner.
AB  - Cysteine-rich protein 61 (Cyr61/CCN1) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) are members of the CCN (CYR61, CTGF, nephroblastoma overexpressed gene) family and exert pleiotropic functions such as regulation of adhesion, migration, extracellular matrix deposition, or cell differentiation, and play an important role in wound healing. This study focused on the nature of the so far unknown CTGF and CYR61 mRNA expression of epithelial cells after infection with bacteria. We demonstrate that infection of epithelial cells with attenuated Yersinia enterocolitica lacking the virulence plasmid pYV leads to the expression of CYR61 and CTGF. Virulent Y. enterocolitica bearing the pYV virulence plasmid suppressed the mRNA expression of these genes. Yersinia-mediated inhibition of CTGF and CYR61 mRNA expression is partially mediated by the cysteine protease YopT. Further characterization of the Yersinia factors, which trigger CTGF and CYR61 mRNA expression, demonstrated that these factors were secreted and could be enriched in lipid extracts. Beside Yersinia, several other bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, or Staphylococcus aureus, as well as supernatants of these bacteria induced CTGF and CYR61 expression. Blocking experiments with the lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor-specific inhibitor Ki16425 suggest a general involvement of LPA receptors in bacteria-triggered CTGF and CYR61 expression. These data suggest that LPA receptor-dependent expression of CTGF and CYR61 represents a common host response after interaction with bacteria.
TI  - Function and molecular architecture of the Yersinia injectisome tip complex.
AB  - By quantitative immunoblot analyses and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), we determined that the needle of the Yersinia enterocolitica E40 injectisome consists of 139 +/- 19 YscF subunits and that the tip complex is formed by three to five LcrV monomers. A pentamer represented the best fit for an atomic model of this complex. The N-terminal globular domain of LcrV forms the base of the tip complex, while the central globular domain forms the head. Hybrids between LcrV and its orthologues PcrV (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) or AcrV (Aeromonas salmonicida) were engineered and recombinant Y. enterocolitica expressing the different hybrids were tested for their capacity to form the translocation pore by a haemolysis assay. There was a good correlation between haemolysis, insertion of YopB into erythrocyte membranes and interaction between YopB and the N-terminal globular domain of the tip complex subunit. Hence, the base of the tip complex appears to be critical for the functional insertion of YopB into the host cell membrane.
TI  - Nucleoside analogues are activated by bacterial deoxyribonucleoside kinases in a  species-specific manner.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the bactericidal activity of antiviral and anticancer  nucleoside analogues against a variety of pathogenic bacteria and characterize the activating enzymes, deoxyribonucleoside kinases (dNKs). METHODS: Several FDA-approved nucleoside analogue drugs were screened for their potential bactericidal activity against several clinical bacterial isolates and type strains. We identified and subcloned the genes coding for putative deoxyribonucleoside kinases in Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Salmonella enterica, Yersinia enterocolitica, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Listeria monocytogenes. These genes were tested for their ability to increase the susceptibility of a dNK-deficient E. coli strain to various analogues. We overexpressed, purified and characterized the substrate specificity and kinetic properties of the recombinant enzymes from S. enterica and B. cereus. RESULTS: The tested Gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) in the concentration range 0.032-31.6 microM except for a single E. coli isolate and two Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates which were resistant to the tested AZT concentrations. Purified recombinant S. enterica thymidine kinase phosphorylated AZT efficiently with a Km of 73.3 microM and k(cat)/Km of 6.6 x 10(4) s(-1) M(-1) and is the activator of this drug in vivo. 2',2'-Difluoro-2'-deoxycytidine (gemcitabine) was a potent antibiotic against Gram-positive bacteria in the concentration range between 0.001 and 1.0 microM. The B. cereus deoxyadenosine kinase had a Km for gemcitabine of 33.5 microM and k(cat)/Km of 5.1 x 10(3) s(-1) M(-1) and activates gemcitabine in vivo. S. enterica and B. cereus are now amongst the first bacteria with a completely characterized set of dNK enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial dNKs efficiently activate nucleoside analogues in a species-specific manner. Therefore, nucleoside analogues have a potential to be employed as antibiotics in the fight against emerging multiresistant bacteria.
TI  - Effect of a simple chlorine dioxide method for controlling five foodborne pathogens, yeasts and molds on blueberries.
AB  - The effect of aqueous chlorine dioxide (ClO(2)) on controlling foodborne pathogens, yeasts, and molds on blueberries was studied. Five pathogens were spot-inoculated on the skin of blueberries. A sachet containing necessary chemicals for generation of ClO(2) was used to provide 320 ppm of ClO(2) in 7.5 l of water. The efficacy of different concentrations (1, 3, 5, 10, and 15 ppm) of ClO(2) and various contact times (10s; 1, 5, 10, 20, 30 min; and 1h and 2h) were studied. ClO(2) was most effective in reducing Listeria monocytogenes (4.88 log cfu/g) as compared to the other pathogens. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was reduced by 2.16 log cfu/g after 5 min when treated with 15 ppm of ClO(2). Relatively short treatment time was more effective in reducing Salmonella Typhimurium than longer treatment time for most concentrations. The highest reduction (4.56 log cfu/g) of Staphylococcus aureus was achieved with 15 ppm of ClO(2) for 30 min. When treated for 2h with 5 ppm of ClO(2), Yersinia enterocolitica was reduced by 3.49 log cfu/g. Fifteen ppm of ClO(2) reduced natural yeasts and molds by 2.82 log cfu/g after 1h. Concentrations of ClO(2) decreased over time. When exposed to blueberries, ClO(2) concentrations were further reduced, showing significant degradation.
TI  - Vapor-phase activities of cinnamon, thyme, and oregano essential oils and key constituents against foodborne microorganisms.
AB  - The aim of the study presented here was to gain knowledge about the vapor-phase antimicrobial activity of selected essential oils and their major putatively active constituents against a range of foodborne bacterial and fungal strains. In a first step, the vapor-phase antimicrobial activities of three commercially available essential oils (EOs)-cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum), thyme (Thymus vulgaris), and oregano (Origanum vulgare)-were evaluated against a wide range of microorganisms, including Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella choleraesuis), Gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecalis), molds (Penicillium islandicum and Aspergillus flavus), and a yeast (Candida albicans). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were generally lower for oregano EO than for the thyme and cinnamon EOs, especially against the relatively resistant Gram-negative. The persistence of the EOs' antimicrobial activities over time was assessed, and changes in the composition of the atmosphere they generated over time were determined using single-drop microextraction (SDME) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and subsequent analysis of the data by principal component analysis (PCA). More relevant chemicals were selected. In addition, the vapor-phase activities of putatively key constituents of the oils were screened against representative Gram-positive (L. monocytogenes) and Gram-negative (S. choleraesuis) bacteria, a mold (A. flavus), and a yeast (C. albicans). Of the tested compounds, cinnamaldehyde, thymol, and carvacrol showed the strongest antimicrobial effectiveness, so their MICs, defined as the minimum vapor concentrations that completely inhibited detectable growth of the microorganisms, were calculated. To check for possible interactions between components present in the EOs, cinnamon EO was fortified with cinnamaldehyde and thyme EO with thymol, and then the antimicrobial activities of the fortified oils were compared to those of the respective unfortified EOs using fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices and by plotting inhibition curves as functions of the vapor-phase concentrations. Synergistic effects were detected for cinnamaldehyde on A. flavus and for thymol on L. monocytogenes, S. choleraesuis, and A. flavus. In all other cases the fortification had additive effects, except for cinnamaldehyde's activity against S. choleraesuis, for which the effect was antagonistic. Finally, various microorganisms were found to cause slight changes over time to the atmospheres generated by all of the EOs (fortified and unfortified) except the fortified cinnamon EO.
TI  - Occurrence of N-acyl-L-homoserine lactones in extracts of some Gram-negative bacteria evaluated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
AB  - Acylated homoserine lactones (AHLs) are self-generated signal molecules that mediate population density-dependent gene expression (quorum sensing) in a variety of Gram-negative bacteria. These signal molecules diffuse from bacterial cells and accumulate in the medium as a function of cell growth. In selected foods AHLs contribute to product spoilage. As different bacterial species produce AHL analogs that differ in length of the N-acyl chain, ranging from 4 to 14 carbons and in the substitution at the C-3 position of the side chain (i.e., oxo or hydroxyl group), the suitability and applicability of a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry direct method for characterizing trace amounts of AHLs was evaluated using N-heptanoyl-homoserine lactone as internal standard. Crude cell-free supernatants of bacterial cultures of Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas salmonicida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Serratia liquefaciens were screened for AHL production in selected ion monitoring mode, using the prominent fragment at m/z 143. The observed profiles of distinguishable N-acyl-homoserine lactones occurring in bacterial extracts were compared and discussed. The presence of a labile 3-oxo-hexanoylhomoserine lactone was evidenced but serious difficulties arose in estimating its concentration as thermal degradation occurs during the gas chromatographic separation. Its electron impact mass spectra was, however, given and interpreted.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of extracts of chemical races of the lichen Pseudevernia furfuracea and their physodic acid, chloroatranorin, atranorin, and olivetoric acid constituents.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity and the MIC values of the ethanol, chloroform, diethyl ether, and acetone extracts of the chemical races of Pseudevernia furfuracea (var. furfuracea and var. ceratea) and their physodic acid, chloroatranorin, atranorin, and olivetoric acid constituents have been investigated against some microorganisms. Nearly all extracts of both chemical races showed antimicrobial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Alternaria alternata, Ascochyta rabiei, Aspergillus niger, Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium moniliforme, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium solani, and Penicillium notatum. There was no antimicrobial activity of the extracts against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas syringae, Salmonella typhimurium, Alternaria citri, Alternaria tenuissima, and Gaeumannomyces graminis. Chloroatranorin and olivetoric acid were active against the same microorganisms with few exceptions. Physodic acid was active against about the same bacteria and yeasts and inactive against all of the filamentous fungi tested. Also no activity of atranorin against the filamentous fungi was observed.
TI  - The structure of MbtI from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the first enzyme in the biosynthesis of the siderophore mycobactin, reveals it to be a salicylate synthase.
AB  - The ability to acquire iron from the extracellular environment is a key determinant of pathogenicity in mycobacteria. Mycobacterium tuberculosis acquires iron exclusively via the siderophore mycobactin T, the biosynthesis of which depends on the production of salicylate from chorismate. Salicylate production in other bacteria is either a two-step process involving an isochorismate synthase (chorismate isomerase) and a pyruvate lyase, as observed for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or a single-step conversion catalyzed by a salicylate synthase, as with Yersinia enterocolitica. Here we present the structure of the enzyme MbtI (Rv2386c) from M. tuberculosis, solved by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction at a resolution of 1.8 A, and biochemical evidence that it is the salicylate synthase necessary for mycobactin biosynthesis. The enzyme is critically dependent on Mg2+ for activity and produces salicylate via an isochorismate intermediate. MbtI is structurally similar to salicylate synthase (Irp9) from Y. enterocolitica and the large subunit of anthranilate synthase (TrpE) and shares the overall architecture of other chorismate-utilizing enzymes, such as the related aminodeoxychorismate synthase PabB. Like Irp9, but unlike TrpE or PabB, MbtI is neither regulated by nor structurally stabilized by bound tryptophan. The structure of MbtI is the starting point for the design of inhibitors of siderophore biosynthesis, which may make useful lead compounds for the production of new antituberculosis drugs, given the strong dependence of pathogenesis on iron acquisition in M. tuberculosis.
TI  - Differential sensitivities of pathogens in red cell concentrates to Tri-P(4)-photoinactivation.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Photodynamic treatment (PDT) with the cationic porphyrin, mono-phenyl-tri-(N-methyl-4-pyridyl)-porphyrin chloride [Tri-P(4)], has previously been shown to be effective at inactivating vesicle stomatitis virus (VSV) in red cell concentrates (RCC) with limited damage to red blood cells (RBC). The aim of this study was to determine the pathogen-inactivating capacity of PDT with Tri-P(4) for a broader range of pathogens and to establish the associated effect on in vitro RBC quality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A series of viruses and bacteria was spiked into 60% RCC. Pathogen inactivation was determined after PDT with 25 microm Tri-P(4) and red light up to 360 kJ/m2. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected cells were evaluated for cell death induction, and RCC were analysed for the induction of haemolysis and ATP content. RESULTS: For the lipid-enveloped viruses bovine viral diarrhoea virus, HIV and pseudorabies virus, and for the Gram positive bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus, and the Gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Yersinia enterolitica, inactivation of > or = 5 log10 was measured after 60 min of PDT with Tri-P(4). The required treatment time to achieve this level of inactivation was four times longer than required for VSV. For cell-associated HIV, only 1.7 log10 of inactivation was found, despite clear induction of cell death of HIV-infected cells. The non-enveloped virus, canine parvovirus, was completely resistant to the treatment. PDT of RCC with Tri-P(4) for 60 min, and subsequent storage in AS-3, resulted in 4% haemolysis after 35 days of storage. The ATP content of untreated and treated RBC declined with similar kinetics during storage. CONCLUSION: PDT of RCC with Tri-P(4) for 60 min inactivates a wide range of pathogens, but not cell-associated HIV and a non-enveloped virus, and compromises RBC quality. This reduces the suitability of PDT with Tri-P(4) for red cell sterilization. Therefore, further improvements in the treatment procedures to potentiate pathogen inactivation and to preserve RBC integrity will be required to generate an effective treatment for sterilizing RCC.
TI  - Antimicrobial and toxicological profile of the new biocide Akacid plus.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Akacid plus is a new member of the polymeric guanidine family of disinfectants. It was especially developed to enhance the antimicrobial activity of this class with significantly less toxicity. The in vitro activity of Akacid plus compared with chlorhexidine digluconate and mupirocin was tested against a total of 369 recent clinical isolates. METHODS: The organisms tested by CLSI reference methods included the following: Staphylococcus aureus (98), Staphylococcus epidermidis (9), Bacillus spp. (2), Enterococcus faecalis (32), Klebsiella spp. (45), Enterobacter spp. (20), Escherichia coli (65), Salmonella spp. (6), Shigella spp. (2), Yersinia enterocolitica (1), Acinetobacter spp. (4), Proteus spp. (7), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (59), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4), Candida spp. (10) and Aspergillus spp. (7). In vitro selection of resistance to Akacid plus was carried out on 24 strains. Toxicological analyses were also performed. RESULTS: All tested agents were more effective against Staphylococcus spp. and Bacillus spp. than against E. faecalis and Gram-negative bacteria. The MIC90s of chlorhexidine and mupirocin showed a 4-fold and 32-fold increase for methicillin-resistant S. aureus in comparison with methicillin-susceptible strains, while MIC values of Akacid plus were similar for antibiotic-susceptible and multiresistant strains. Bactericidal action of Akacid plus was observed at 1-2x MIC. The in vitro selection of resistance test showed no increase in MIC values of Akacid plus for any isolate after 30 passages. In addition, Akacid plus showed low oral and dermal toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results demonstrate the broad antimicrobial properties of Akacid plus, which makes it a promising tool for topical application in the prophylaxis and treatment of bacterial and fungal infections.
TI  - Elimination and multiplication of bacteria during preparation and storage of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of bacterial contamination of random-donor platelet concentrates (PCs) is considerably lower than that of blood donations. Which key steps of the preparation procedure contribute to the elimination of bacteria was investigated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Ten bacteria species were used. Blood donations were spiked with bacteria and stored at 22 degrees C for 8 hours. The buffy coats were kept for 6 hours. PCs were prepared from pools of 4 buffy coats. At each preparation step and during PC storage, bacteria contents were measured. In additional experiments, the titers of spiked blood and buffy coats were determined after storage at 20, 22, or 24 degrees C for 8 and up to 24 hours, respectively. RESULTS: Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, and Yersinia enterocolitica were completely inactivated during storage in blood or buffy coats. Titer reduction was between 3.32 and 4.62 log. Bacillus cereus, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis did not multiply. Compared with their values in spiked blood the titers in the PCs were reduced by 1.7 to 2.8 log. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the only species that grew in blood. With the exception of P. acnes, those species that were not removed by the preparation process multiplied in the PCs. Remarkable donor-to-donor variations of the bactericidal activities of buffy coats were detected when the storage time was prolonged to 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria are significantly eliminated by the preparation procedure for random donor PCs. Also, blood and buffy coats are bactericidal for most species. When buffy-coat storage is prolonged, it cannot, however, be predicted whether specific strains vanish or multiply.
TI  - Long- and short-chain plant-produced bacterial N-acyl-homoserine lactones become  components of phyllosphere, rhizosphere, and soil.
AB  - Two N-acyl-homoserine lactone (acyl-HSL) synthase genes, lasI from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and yenI from Yersinia enterocolitica, were introduced into tobacco, individually and in combination. Liquid chromatograph-tandem mass spectrometry and thin-layer chromatography confirmed products of lasI and yenI activity in single and cotransformants. Cotransformants expressing plastid-localized LasI and YenI synthases produced the major acyl-HSLs for each synthase in all tissues tested. Total acyl-HSL signals accumulated in leaf tissue up to 3 pmol/mg of fresh weight, half as much in stem tissue, and approximately 10-fold less in root tissues. Acyl-HSLs were present in aqueous leaf washes from greenhouse-grown transgenic plants. Transgenic lines grown for 14 days under axenic conditions produced detectable levels of acyl-HSLs in root exudates. Ethyl acetate extractions of rhizosphere and nonrhizosphere soil from transgenically grown plants contained active acyl-HSLs, whereas plant-free soil or rhizosphere and nonrhizosphere soil from wild-type plants lacked detectable amounts of acyl-HSLs. This work shows that bioactive acyl-HSLs are exuded from leaves and roots and accumulate in the phytosphere of plants engineered to produce acyl-HSLs. These data further suggest that plants that are bioengineered to synthesize acyl-HSLs can foster beneficial plant-bacteria communications or deter deleterious interactions. Therefore, it is feasible to use bioengineered plants to supplement soils with specific acyl-HSLs to modulate bacterial phenotypes and plant-associated bacterial community structures.
TI  - Comparison of bactericidal activity of six lysozymes at atmospheric pressure and  under high hydrostatic pressure.
AB  - The antibacterial working range of six lysozymes was tested under ambient and high pressure, on a panel of five gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus lysodeikticus) and five gram-negative bacteria (Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella flexneri, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium). The lysozymes included two that are commercially available (hen egg white lysozyme or HEWL, and mutanolysin from Streptomyces globisporus or M1L), and four that were chromatographically purified (bacteriophage lambda lysozyme or LaL, bacteriophage T4 lysozyme or T4L, goose egg white lysozyme or GEWL, and cauliflower lysozyme or CFL). T4L, LaL and GEWL were highly pure as evaluated by silver staining of SDS-PAGE gels and zymogram analysis while CFL was only partially pure. At ambient pressure each gram-positive test organism displayed a specific pattern of sensitivity to the six lysozymes, but none of the gram-negative bacteria was sensitive to any of the lysozymes. High pressure treatment (130-300 MPa, 25 degrees C, 15 min) sensitised several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria for one or more lysozymes. M. lysodeikticus and P. aeruginosa became sensitive to all lysozymes under high pressure, S. typhimurium remained completely insensitive to all lysozymes, and the other bacteria showed sensitisation to some of the lysozymes. The possible applications of the different lysozymes as biopreservatives, and the possible reasons for the observed differences in bactericidal specificity are discussed.
TI  - Basics of flow cytometry-based sterility testing of platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Flow cytometry (FACS) is a common technique in blood banking. It is used, for example, for the enumeration of residual white blood cells in plasma and in cellular blood products. It was investigated whether it can also be applied for sterility testing of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates (PCs). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma-reduced PCs were spiked with bacteria and stored at 20 to 24 or 37 degrees C for various times. The following 10 species were used: Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Bacterial DNA was stained with thiazole orange. After the platelets were lysed, bacteria were enumerated by FACS. RESULTS: All bacteria species used were detectable by FACS. The lower detection limit was approximately 100 bacteria per microL, that is, 10(5) per mL. In general, the titers measured were 1.2- to 3-fold higher than those determined by colony forming assay. In one case (K. pneumoniae) in which the dot plot of the bacteria cloud overlapped with that of bacteria debris, they were consistently lower. When PC samples were inoculated with approximately 1 colony-forming unit per mL of bacteria and kept at 37 degrees C, most species were detected within 21 hours or less. Exceptions were E. cloacae and P. acnes, which were detected after 24 to 40 and 64 hours, respectively. At 20 to 24 degrees C, the detection times were strongly prolonged. CONCLUSION: Sterility testing of PCs by FACS is a feasible approach. The present data suggest incubating PC samples for 20 to 24 hours at 37 degrees C before testing. For slow-growing bacteria, the incubation period must be prolonged by 1 to 2 days.
TI  - Functional analysis of the post-transcriptional regulator RsmA reveals a novel RNA-binding site.
AB  - The RsmA family of RNA-binding proteins are global post-transcriptional regulators that mediate extensive changes in gene expression in bacteria. They bind to, and affect the translation rate of target mRNAs, a function that is further modulated by one or more, small, untranslated competitive regulatory RNAs. To gain new insights into the nature of this protein/RNA interaction, we used X-ray crystallography to solve the structure of the Yersinia enterocolitica RsmA homologue. RsmA consists of a dimeric beta barrel from which two alpha helices are projected. From structure-based alignments of the RsmA protein family from diverse bacteria, we identified key amino acid residues likely to be involved in RNA-binding. Site-specific mutagenesis revealed that arginine at position 44, located at the N terminus of the alpha helix is essential for biological activity in vivo and RNA-binding in vitro. Mutation of this site affects swarming motility, exoenzyme and secondary metabolite production in the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, carbon metabolism in Escherichia coli, and hydrogen cyanide production in the plant beneficial strain Pseudomonas fluorescens CHA0. R44A mutants are also unable to interact with the small untranslated RNA, RsmZ. Thus, although possessing a motif similar to the KH domain of some eukaryotic RNA-binding proteins, RsmA differs substantially and incorporates a novel class of RNA-binding site.
TI  - PscF is a major component of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa type III secretion needle.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen, translocates exoenzymes (Exo) directly into the eukaryotic cell cytoplasm. This is accomplished by a type III secretion/translocation machinery. Here, we show that the P. aeruginosa type III secretory needle structure is composed essentially of PscF, a protein required for secretion and P. aeruginosa cytotoxicity. Partially purified needles, detached from the bacterial surface, are 60-80 nm in length and 7 nm in width, resembling needles from Yersinia spp.. YscF of Yersinia enterocolitica was able to functionally complement the pscF deletion, but required 11 P. aeruginosa-specific amino acids at the N-terminus for its function.
TI  - A study on inhibitory effects of Sigla tree (Liquidambar orientalis Mill. var. orientalis) storax against several bacteria.
AB  - In this study, Sigla (Liquidambar orientalis Mill.) storax (styrax) was investigated for antibacterial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, B. brevis, B. cereus, B. megaterium, B. subtilis, Corynebacterium xerosis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, Staphylococcus aureus and Yersinia enterocolitica. The storax was dissolved in absolute ethanol and was tested at concentrations of 10.0%, 1.0%, 0.4%, 0.2% and 0.1%. Pure ethanol was used for the control. The antibacterial activity of the Sigla storax was determined by using the agar diffusion method. The growths of A. hydrophila, B. amyloliquefaciens, B. megaterium, E. coli, E. coli O157:H7, L. monocytogenes and Y. enterocolitica were not inhibited by any of the concentrations of Sigla storax. The results showed that Sigla storax has antibacterial activity against many bacteria at concentrations of 10.0% and against some bacteria at concentrations of 1.0%, 0.4% and 0.2%.
TI  - Solid- and vapor-phase antimicrobial activities of six essential oils: susceptibility of selected foodborne bacterial and fungal strains.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of essential oils (EOs) of cinnamon (Cinnamon zeylanicum), clove (Syzygium aromaticum), basil (Ocimum basillicum), rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), dill (Anethum graveolens), and ginger (Zingiber officinalis) was evaluated over a range of concentrations in two types of contact tests (solid and vapor diffusion). The EOs were tested against an array of four Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Listeria monocytogenes), four Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella choleraesuis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and three fungi (a yeast, Candida albicans, and two molds, Penicillium islandicum and Aspergillus flavus). The rationale for this work was to test the possibility of creating a protective atmosphere by using natural compounds that could extend the shelf life of packaged foodstuffs while minimizing organoleptic alterations. In the solid diffusion tests, cinnamon and clove gave the strongest (and very similar) inhibition, followed by basil and rosemary, with dill and ginger giving the weakest inhibition. The fungi were the most sensitive microorganisms, followed by the Gram-positive bacterial strains. The Gram-negative strain P. aeruginosa was the least inhibited. The composition of the atmosphere generated by the EOs, and their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), were determined using a disk volatilization method, in which no inhibition from rosemary or basil was observed. Cinnamon and clove, once again, gave similar results for every microorganism. As a general rule, MIC (fungi) << MIC (bacteria) with no clear differences between Gram-positive or -negative strains except for P. aeruginosa, which was not inhibited by any of the EOs in the vapor phase. The atmosphere generated from the EOs was analyzed by means of solid-phase microextraction combined with gas chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry. Differences among the volatiles in the EOs, which may be responsible for the differences in their antimicrobial performances, were found.
TI  - Protective anti-V antibodies inhibit Pseudomonas and Yersinia translocon assembly within host membranes.
AB  - Pathogenic Yersinia species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa share a similar type III secretion/translocation system. The translocation system consists of 3 secreted proteins, YopB/PopB, YopD/PopD, and LcrV/PcrV; the latter is known to be a protective antigen. In an in vitro assay, the translocation system causes the lysis of erythrocytes infected with wild-type (wt) P. aeruginosa. wt Y. enterocolitica is not hemolytic, but a multiknockout mutant deprived of all the effectors and of YopN ( Delta HOPEMN) is hemolytic. In the presence of antibodies against PcrV and Y. pestis LcrV, the hemolytic activity of P. aeruginosa was inhibited. Similarly, the hemolytic activity of Delta HOPEMN was inhibited in the presence of anti-LcrV antibodies. The assembly of the translocon, composed of PopB/D and YopB/D proteins, was disturbed in immunoprotected erythrocyte membranes, mimicking the phenotypes of V knockout mutants. Thus, protective antibodies against the V antigens of Yersinia species and P. aeruginosa act at the level of the formation of the translocon pore in membranes of infected host cells by blocking the function of LcrV/PcrV. The hemolysis assay could be adapted for high-throughput screening of anti-infectious compounds that specifically target the type III translocon.
TI  - Occurrence of sublethal injury after pulsed electric fields depending on the micro-organism, the treatment medium ph and the intensity of the treatment investigated.
AB  - AIMS: The objective was to investigate the occurrence of sublethal injury after pulsed electric field (PEF) depending on the treatment time, the electric field strength and the pH of the treatment media in two Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis ssp. niger, Listeria monocytogenes) and six Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella serotype Senftenberg 775W, Salmonella serotype Typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica) bacterial strains. METHODS AND RESULTS: A characteristic behaviour was observed for the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria studied. Whereas Gram-positive bacteria showed a higher PEF resistance at pH 7.0, the Gram-negative were more resistant at pH 4.0. In these conditions, in which bacteria showed their maximum resistance, a large proportion of sublethally injured cells were detected. In most cases, the longer the treatment time and the higher the electric field applied, the greater the proportion of sublethally injured cells that were detected. No sublethal injury was detected when Gram-positive bacteria were treated at pH 4.0 and Gram-negative at pH 7.0. CONCLUSIONS: Sublethal injury was detected after PEF so, bacterial inactivation by PEF is not an 'all or nothing' event. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This work could be useful for improving food preservation by PEF.
TI  - Characterization of a Type III secretion substrate specificity switch (T3S4) domain in YscP from Yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  - The length of the needle ending the Yersinia Ysc injectisome is determined by YscP, a protein acting as a molecular ruler. In addition, YscP is required for Yop secretion. In the present paper, by a systematic deletion analysis, we localized accurately the region required for Yop secretion between residues 405 and 500. As this C-terminal region of YscP has also been shown to control needle length it probably represents the substrate specificity switch of the machinery. By a bioinformatics analysis, we show that this region has a globular structure, an original alpha/beta fold, a P-x-L-G signature and presumably no catalytic activity. In spite of very limited sequence similarities, this structure is conserved among the proteins that are presumed to control the needle length in many different injectisomes and also among members of the FliK family, which control the flagellar hook length. This region thus represents a new protein domain that we called T3S4 for Type III secretion substrate specificity switch. The T3S4 domain of YscP can be replaced by the T3S4 domain of AscP (Aeromonas salmonicida) or PscP (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) but not by the one from FliK, indicating that in spite of a common global structure, these domains need to fit their partner proteins in the secretion apparatus.
TI  - Photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen HCl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (7 species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol, Baxter Healthcare) or saline. After PCT with 150 micro mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) UVA, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. RESULTS: The level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. Log reduction of Gram-positive bacteria for Staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for Staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for Streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for Listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for Corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for Bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for Lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for Propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for Clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. Log reduction of Gram-negative bacteria for Escherichia coli was > 6.4; for Serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for Klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for Salmonella choleraesuis, > 6.2; for Yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for Enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. Log reduction of spirochetes for Treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for Borrelia burgdorferi, > 6.9. CONCLUSION: PCT inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. The inactivation of bacteria in PLT concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent PLT-transfusion-associated bacteremia.
TI  - Inhibition of foodborne bacteria by the lactoperoxidase system in a beef cube system.
AB  - Biopreservatives are being developed to inhibit the growth of foodborne pathogens and thus improve food safety. The lactoperoxidase system (LPS) is a naturally occurring system that has potential for use as an antimicrobial agent in foods. Growth of single strains of the pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and beef microflora were assessed on LPS-treated meat surfaces in an experimental system. Beef cubes inoculated with approximately 10(4) cfu cm(-2) of bacteria were treated with the LPS and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h, 12 degrees C for 7 days or in a chilling regime: 12 to -1 degrees C over 1 week and held at -1 degrees C for 4 weeks. Treatment with LPS was more effective at storage temperatures non-permissive for rapid bacterial growth with strong inhibition of growth achieved on LPS-treated cubes at 12 degrees C and reduction in pathogen viable counts at chilling temperatures. At chilling temperatures, the LPS inhibited the growth of native pseudomonads but did not prevent the development of native lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Reduced virulence of a hfq mutant of Pseudomonas aeruginosa O1.
AB  - The Sm-like protein Hfq has been implicated in the regulation of sigmaS-dependent and sigmaS-independent genes in E. coli and in the regulation of virulence factors in both, Yersinia enterocolitica and Brucella abortus. Here, we have studied the effect of Hfq on virulence and stress response of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO1). We have constructed a PAO1hfq- mutant and a PAO1hfq-rpoS- double mutant to permit distinction between direct and indirect effects of Hfq. When compared to the wild-type and the rpoS- strains, the hfq knock out strain showed a reduced growth rate and was unable to utilize glucose as a sole carbon source. Elastase activity was 80% reduced in the hfq- mutant when compared to the wild-type or the rpoS- strain, whereas alginate production seemed to be solely affected by sigmaS. The production of catalase and pyocyanin was shown to be affected in an additive manner by both, Hfq and sigmaS. Moreover, twitching and swarming mediated by typeIV pili was shown to be impaired in the hfq- mutant. When compared to PAO1 wild-type and the rpoS- mutant, the hfq- mutant decreased virulence in Galleria mellonella by a factor of 1 x 10(4) and 5 x 10(3), respectively. Likewise, when compared to wild-type, the PAO1hfq- mutant was significantly attenuated in virulence when administered intraperitoneally in mice. These results strongly suggest that Hfq is a global regulator of PAO1 virulence and stress response which is not exclusively due to its role in stimulating the synthesis of sigmaS.
TI  - Severe bacterial infection in transfusion-dependent patients with thalassemia major.
AB  - The incidence and clinical spectrum of severe bacterial infection were studied in 89 patients with thalassemia major that was diagnosed between January 1971 and March 2002. There were 20 patients with 24 episodes of severe bacterial infection, resulting in an incidence of 1.6 infections per 100 patient-years. The clinical spectrum included liver abscess (6 cases), septicemia (6 cases), soft-tissue infection (2 cases), osteomyelitis (2 cases), corneal ulcer (1 case), enteritis (1 case), and abscesses of the lung, kidney, intra-abdominal region, retropharynx, gums, and buttocks (1 case each). The leading causal microorganisms were gram-negative bacilli, especially Klebsiella pneumoniae (10 of 20 isolates). Other responsible pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2/20), Vibrio vulnificus (2/20), Acinetobacter baumanii (1/20), Streptococcus intermidius (1/20), Yersinia enterocolitica (1/20), Staphylococcus aureus (1/20), Escherichia coli (1/20), and Salmonella species (1/20). Splenectomy and delays in the start of iron-chelating therapy were 2 independent risk factors.
TI  - Emerging water-borne pathogens.
AB  - Emerging water-borne pathogens constitute a major health hazard in both developed and developing nations. A new dimension to the global epidemiology of cholera-an ancient scourge-was provided by the emergence of Vibrio cholerae O139. Also, water-borne enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli ( E. coli O157:H7), although regarded as a problem of the industrialized west, has recently caused outbreaks in Africa. Outbreaks of chlorine-resistant Cryptosporidium have motivated water authorities to reassess the adequacy of current water-quality regulations. Of late, a host of other organisms, such as hepatitis viruses (including hepatitis E virus), Campylobacter jejuni, microsporidia, cyclospora, Yersinia enterocolitica, calciviruses and environmental bacteria like Mycobacterium spp, aeromonads, Legionella pneumophila and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been associated with water-borne illnesses. This review critically examines the potential of these as emerging water-borne pathogens. It also examines the possible reasons, such as an increase in the number of immunocompromised individuals, urbanization and horizontal gene transfer, that may underlie their emergence. Further, measures required to face the challenge posed by these pathogens are also discussed.
TI  - Reactivity of secretory IgA antibodies in breast milk from 107 Japanese mothers to 20 environmental antigens.
AB  - The secretory IgA (sIgA) antibody response to 20 environmental antigens, including microorganisms, toxins, food, and inhaled allergens, was evaluated in the breast milk from 107 Japanese mothers 1-10 days after delivery. Specific sIgA antibody responses were detected in most milk samples against almost all of the antigens tested, although there was a wide variation in the specific sIgA antibody profiles of each individual's milk. With regard to twelve bacterial antigens, highly specific sIgA antibody responses were detected against Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With regard to eight nonbacterial antigens, highly specific sIgA antibody responses were detected against rotavirus, cholera, and pertussis toxins. Similar sIgA antibody profiles were obtained when the 107 milk specimens were divided into colostrum (milk 1-5 days after delivery, n = 36) and transitional milk (milk 6-10 days after delivery, n = 71). This study provides information on the possible protective role of human milk sIgA antibodies and will serve as a baseline for future studies.
TI  - Single-tube, nested PCR for the diagnosis of human brucellosis in Kuwait.
AB  - The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) offers a sensitive and specific way of detecting microbial DNA in clinical samples. The aims of the present study were to develop an assay, based on a single-tube, nested PCR, for identifying Brucella in samples of human blood and then to explore the use of this test in diagnosis. The primers chosen were derived from IS711, the insertion sequence gene found in all species of Brucella. The assay amplified a 52-bp final product which was detected colorimetrically. The PCR was sensitive and specific, giving positive reactions with 14 strains of Brucella from five species. The lower limit of detection in vitro was 30 organisms. There were no false-positive reactions either with a range of bacteria known to evoke serological cross-reactions with Brucella (Vibrio cholerae, Yersinia enterocolitica, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli K12) or with organisms producing similar clinical syndromes (Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Salmonella typhi). The results of a preliminary field trial of the assay in Kuwait indicate that the assay may be a valuable technique in the diagnosis of human brucellosis, meriting further study with larger numbers of cases. All 28 subjects with brucellosis (diagnosed on the basis of typical clinical features and confirmed by positive serology and, in three cases, by positive blood cultures) were PCR-positive whereas 28 healthy controls and 28 patients with febrile illness attributable to infections other than brucellosis were PCR-negative.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of citrate and acetate.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We evaluated citrate salt, acetate salt, and their combinations for antibacterial activity against a sample of common pathogens. METHODS: Bacterial suspensions were added to serial microdilutions of the salts in broth, with final cell concentrations of 10(4-5) colony-forming units per milliliter. After overnight incubation at 35 degrees C, the minimum inhibitory concentration was recorded. Bactericidal activity was screened by quantitative subcultures from the minimum inhibitory concentration dilution. RESULTS: Citrate salt was active against gram-positive species and Candida albicans but showed little activity against gram-negative species; acetate salt showed the opposite results. Their combination did not show synergism or antagonism. CONCLUSION: It may be feasible to take advantage of the different antibacterial spectra of these two agents and combine them for possible application such as food or medical preservative agents.
TI  - Bacterial population of a two-phase anaerobic digestion process treating effluent of cassava starch factory.
AB  - Different groups of microorganisms in a two-phase anaerobic system were enumerated to evaluate the prevalence of specific groups and species. Total and fecal coliforms showed similar values both in acidogenic and methanogenic reactors. The fecal streptococci were 4-fold higher in the acidogenic reactor, when compared with those of the methanogenic reactor. As expected, no methane forming or sulfate reducing bacteria were found in the acidogenic reactor. The populations of methanogenic bacteria were dominated by a mixed population of straight to curved rods and multicellular filaments which strongly resembled members of the genus Methanosaeta. Seven prevalent species of facultative anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were identified as Previdencia alcalifacienciens, Providencia rettgeri, Enterobacter cloaceae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus pennri and Yersinia enterocolitica. The species Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stentophomonas maltophila and Acinotobacter iwoffi, were the most frequently isolated glucose non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli. Among these species, only P. aeruginosa was present in high number in each sample.
TI  - Reduction of iron by extracellular iron reductases: implications for microbial iron acquisition.
AB  - The extracellular enzymatic reduction of iron by microorganisms has not been appropriately considered. In this study the reduction and release of iron from ferrioxamine were examined using extracellular microbial iron reductases and compared to iron mobilization by chemical reductants, and to chelation by EDTA and desferrioxamine. A flavin semiquinone was formed during the enzymatic reduction of ferrioxamine, which was consistent with the 1 e(-) reduction of iron by an enzyme. The rates for the enzymatic reactions were substantially faster than both the 2 e(-) chemical reductions and the chelation reactions. The rapid rates of the enzymatic reduction reactions demonstrated that these enzymes are capable of accomplishing the extracellular mobilization of iron required by microorganisms. The data suggest that mechanistically there are two phases for the mobilization and transport of iron by those microorganisms that produce both extracellular iron reductases and siderophores, with reduction being the principle pathway.
TI  - Representational difference analysis uncovers a novel IS10-like insertion element unique to pathogenic strains of Yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  - The method of suppressive subtractive hybridization was employed to map out genomic differences between the highly pathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica (Ye) biogroup 1B, serotype O:8 strain (WA-314) and the closely related apathogenic Y. enterocolitica biogroup 1A, serotype O:5 strain (NF-O). A novel IS10-like element, IS1330, uncovered by this technique was found to be uniquely present in high copy numbers among the highly pathogenic Y. enterocolitica 1B strains, while a single copy of the element was found in the low pathogenic Ye biogroup 4 serotype O:3 strain. The 1321-bp repetitive element has 19-bp imperfect inverted terminal repeats and is bracketed by a 10-bp duplication of the target sequence. The predicted transposase shares high homology with the IS10 open reading frame of the large virulence plasmid pWR501, of Shigella flexneri, with IS10 transposase of Salmonella typhi, and with IS1999 (tnpA) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The IS1330 tnp gene is transcribed in vitro and in vivo in HeLa cells. At least one copy of IS1330 flanks the recently described chromosomal type III secretion cluster in Y. enterocolitica WA-314, O:8, and future studies should shed light on whether this novel transposase mediates transposition events in highly pathogenic Y. enterocolitica strains, thus enhancing the genetic plasticity of this species.
TI  - Yersinia enterocolitica evasion of the host innate immune response by V antigen-induced IL-10 production of macrophages is abrogated in IL-10-deficient mice.
AB  - The virulence-associated V Ag (LcrV) of pathogenic Yersinia species is part of the translocation apparatus, required to deliver antihost effector proteins (Yersinia outer proteins) into host cells. An orthologous protein (denoted as PcrV) has also been identified in the ExoS regulon of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Additionally, it is known that LcrV is released by yersiniae into the environment and that LcrV causes an immunosuppressive effect when injected into mice. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that rLcrV, but not PcrV, is capable of suppressing TNF-alpha production in zymosan A-stimulated mouse macrophages and the human monocytic Mono-Mac-6 cell line. The underlying mechanism of TNF-alpha suppression could be assigned to LcrV-mediated IL (IL)-10 production, because 1) LcrV induces IL-10 release in macrophages, 2) anti-IL-10 Ab treatment completely abrogated TNF-alpha suppression, and 3) TNF-alpha suppression was absent in LcrV-treated macrophages of IL-10-deficient (IL-10-/-) mice. The relevance of LcrV-mediated immunosuppression for the pathogenicity of yersiniae became evident by experimental infection of mice; in contrast to wild-type mice, IL-10-/- mice were highly resistant against Yersinia infection, as shown by lower bacterial load in spleen and liver, absent abscess formation in these organs, and survival.
TI  - Molecular mechanisms of bacteria induced apoptosis.
AB  - Interaction of mammalian cells with pathogenic bacteria results in a whole variety of responses in the infected cells including internalization or phagocytosis of the bacterium, release of cytokines, secretion of defensins or production of oxygen radicals. However, recent studies pointed out that many bacteria are able to trigger apoptosis in the host cell. The induction of apoptosis upon infection results from a complex interaction of bacterial proteins with cellular proteins finally mediating apoptosis. Thus, bacteria are able to activate several pro-apoptotic proteins, e.g. caspases, to inactivate anti-apoptotic proteins, e.g. NF(kappa)B or MAP-kinases, or to upregulate endogenous receptor/ligand systems, that induce apoptosis, on the surface of the infected cell. Host cell apoptosis very often serves the bacteria to attack the host and to gain access to the tissue. However, in some infections, apoptosis of mammalian cells significantly contributes to the host defense against the bacteria further indicating the role of apoptosis in host-pathogen interactions.
TI  - Conserved DegP protease in gram-positive bacteria is essential for thermal and oxidative tolerance and full virulence in Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - The DegP protease, a multifunctional chaperone and protease, has been shown to be essential for virulence in gram-negative pathogens such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Brucella abortus, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The function of DegP in pathogenesis appears to be the degradation of damaged proteins that accumulate as a result of the initial host response to infection, which includes the release of reactive oxygen intermediates. Additionally, the DegP protease plays a major role in monitoring and maintaining the Escherichia coli periplasm and influences E. coli pilus biogenesis. We report here the identification of highly homologous enzymes in Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. Moreover, the phenotype of an insertionally inactivated degP allele in S. pyogenes is similar to that reported for E. coli, with temperature sensitivity for growth and enhanced sensitivity to reactive oxygen intermediates. Virulence studies in a mouse model of streptococcal infection indicate that a functional DegP protease is required for full virulence. These results suggest DegP as an attractive broad-spectrum target for future anti-infective drug development.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oils from plants against selected pathogenic  and saprophytic microorganisms.
AB  - The beneficial health effects of extracts from many types of plants that are used as seasoning agents in foods and beverages have been claimed for centuries. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of selected herb and spice essential oils for control of growth and survival of microorganisms. Inhibition of growth was tested by the paper disc agar diffusion method. Antibiotic susceptibility discs were used as control. Minimum lethal concentration (MLC) was determined by the tube dilution method. Essential oils from anise, angelica, basil, carrot, celery, cardamom, coriander, dill weed, fennel, oregano, parsley, and rosemary were evaluated. Inhibition ranged from complete with oregano to no inhibition with carrot oil for each of the test strains that included: Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O:157:H7, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Lactobacillus plantarum, Aspergillus niger, Geotrichum, and Rhodotorula. Oregano essential oil showed the greatest inhibition (zone, > or = 70 to 80 mm) (MLC, approximately 8 ppm). Coriander and basil were also highly inhibitory (MLC, approximately 25 to 50 ppm) to E. coli O:157:H7 and to the other bacteria and fungi tested. Anise oil was not particularly inhibitory to bacteria (inhibition zone, approximately 25 mm); however, anise oil was highly inhibitory to molds. Because some of the herbal and spice essential oils are highly inhibitory to selected pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms, they may provide alternatives and supplements to conventional antimicrobial additives in foods.
TI  - [Diagnostic value of a novel nutrient medium for isolation and cultivation of pathogens causing enteric yersiniosis and pseudotuberculosis].
AB  - A new nutrient medium for isolation and cultivation of the causative agents of enteric yersiniosis and pseudotuberculosis was found to have advantages over Endo medium in its differentiating and inhibiting properties. This medium permitted the easy differentiation of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis from Y. enterocolitica, as well as from Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. rhinoscleromatis, Hafnia, Enterobacter and Citrobacter by color; from Proteus inconstans by swarming. In addition, weakly swarming of P. vulgaris differed by their light bluish color and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, by the brilliance and size of colonies. Endo medium could be used only for differentiation of E. coli from lactose-negative Yersinia colonies, Klebsiella (by mucous growth) and, to a certain extent, all Proteus species (by swarming). The medium under test and the control medium inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus. In contrast to Endo medium, the medium under test partially inhibited the growth of K. rhinoscleromatis and the swarming of P. inconstans. The new medium is now introduced into practice.
TI  - Essential PchG-dependent reduction in pyochelin biosynthesis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The biosynthetic genes pchDCBA and pchEF, which are known to be required for the  formation of the siderophore pyochelin and its precursors salicylate and dihydroaeruginoate (Dha), are clustered with the pchR regulatory gene on the chromosome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The 4.6-kb region located downstream of the pchEF genes was found to contain three additional, contiguous genes, pchG, pchH, and pchI, probably forming a pchEFGHI operon. The deduced amino acid sequences of PchH and PchI are similar to those of ATP binding cassette transport proteins with an export function. PchG is a homolog of the Yersinia pestis and Y. enterocolitica proteins YbtU and Irp3, which are involved in the biosynthesis of yersiniabactin. A null mutation in pchG abolished pyochelin formation, whereas mutations in pchH and pchI did not affect the amounts of salicylate, Dha, and pyochelin produced. The pyochelin biosynthetic genes were expressed from a vector promoter, uncoupling them from Fur-mediated repression by iron and PchR-dependent induction by pyochelin. In a P. aeruginosa mutant lacking the entire pyochelin biosynthetic gene cluster, the expressed pchDCBA and pchEFG genes were sufficient for salicylate, Dha, and pyochelin production. Pyochelin formation was also obtained in the heterologous host Escherichia coli expressing pchDCBA and pchEFG together with the E. coli entD gene, which provides a phosphopantetheinyl transferase necessary for PchE and PchF activation. The PchG protein was purified and used in combination with PchD and phosphopantetheinylated PchE and PchF in vitro to produce pyochelin from salicylate, L-cysteine, ATP, NADPH, and S-adenosylmethionine. Based on this assay, a reductase function was attributed to PchG. In summary, this study completes the identification of the biosynthetic genes required for pyochelin formation from chorismate in P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Gatifloxacin: a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - Gatifloxacin is a new 8-methoxy-fluoroquinoline antimicrobial agent. It has enhanced activity against Gram-positive and atypical agents, while retaining broad-spectrum antiGram-negative activity. For example, the MIC(90) values for respiratory tract pathogens are < or = 0.5 microg/ml for organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (regardless of penicillin susceptibility), Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive or negative), Moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive or negative), Legionella species, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic Streptococci (macrolide sensitive or resistant), Neisseria species, most Enterobacteriaceae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, Pasteurella species, Vibrio species and Yersinia enterocolitica. For methicillin-resistant S. aureus, ciprofloxacin-resistant S. aureus, Citrobacter freundii, Providencia species, Serratia species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli, the MIC(90) are elevated. Gatifloxacin is bactericidal and exhibits a post-antibiotic effect against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. The standard dose is 400 mg once daily and is available in both oral and iv. formulation. Gatifloxacin appears to have a low propensity for the selection of resistant mutants. Clinical trial data supports the use of gatifloxacin for treatment of patients with respiratory tract, urinary tract, skin and soft tissue infections. The side effect profile for gatifloxacin is similar to that with other agents.
TI  - YscP, a Yersinia protein required for Yop secretion that is surface exposed, and  released in low Ca2+.
AB  - The Yersinia Ysc apparatus is made of more than 20 proteins, 11 of which have homologues in many type III systems. Here, we characterize YscP from Yersinia enterocolitica. This 515-residue protein has a high proline content, a large tandem repetition and a slow migration in SDS-PAGE. Unlike the products of neighbouring genes, it has a counterpart only in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and it varies even between Yersinia Ysc machineries. An yscPDelta97-465 mutant was unable to secrete any Yop, even under conditions overcoming feedback inhibition of Yop synthesis. Interestingly, a cloned yscPDelta57-324 from Yersinia pestis introduced in the yscPDelta97-465 mutant can sustain a significant Yop secretion and thus partially complemented the mutation. This explains the leaky phenotype observed with the yscP mutant of Y. pestis. In accordance with this secretion deficiency, YscP is required for the delivery of Yop effectors into macrophages. Mechanical shearing, immunolabelling and electron microscopy experiments showed that YscP is exposed at the bacterial surface when bacteria are incubated at 37 degrees C in the presence of Ca2+ and thus do not secrete Yops. At 37 degrees C, when Ca2+ ions are chelated, YscP is released like a Yop protein. We conclude that YscP is a part of the Ysc injectisome which is localized at the bacterial surface and is destabilized by Ca2+ chelation.
TI  - Pseudomonas syringae Hrp type III secretion system and effector proteins.
AB  - Pseudomonas syringae is a member of an important group of Gram-negative bacterial pathogens of plants and animals that depend on a type III secretion system to inject virulence effector proteins into host cells. In P. syringae, hrp/hrc genes encode the Hrp (type III secretion) system, and avirulence (avr) and Hrp-dependent outer protein (hop) genes encode effector proteins. The hrp/hrc genes of P. syringae pv syringae 61, P. syringae pv syringae B728a, and P. syringae pv tomato DC3000 are flanked by an exchangeable effector locus and a conserved effector locus in a tripartite mosaic Hrp pathogenicity island (Pai) that is linked to a tRNA(Leu) gene found also in Pseudomonas aeruginosa but without linkage to Hrp system genes. Cosmid pHIR11 carries a portion of the strain 61 Hrp pathogenicity island that is sufficient to direct Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas fluorescens to inject HopPsyA into tobacco cells, thereby eliciting a hypersensitive response normally triggered only by plant pathogens. Large deletions in strain DC3000 revealed that the conserved effector locus is essential for pathogenicity but the exchangeable effector locus has only a minor role in growth in tomato. P. syringae secretes HopPsyA and AvrPto in culture in a Hrp-dependent manner at pH and temperature conditions associated with pathogenesis. AvrPto is also secreted by Yersinia enterocolitica. The secretion of AvrPto depends on the first 15 codons, which are also sufficient to direct the secretion of an Npt reporter from Y. enterocolitica, indicating that a universal targeting signal is recognized by the type III secretion systems of both plant and animal pathogens.
TI  - [Analysis of bacteriocinogenic properties of Yersinia enterocolitica strains].
AB  - The aim of the study was the investigation of bacteriocinogenic properties of 102 Yersinia enterocolitica strains. The influence of selected factors on the production of bacteriocins by Y. enterocolitica and properties of jersiniacin 44JPSBKOH were also investigated. Bacteriocinogenic properties of Y. enterocolitica strains were tested by using the delayed cross-streaking method. It was found that the production of bacteriocins by Y. enterocolitica depended on the type of media on which the producer and indicator strains were grown. It turned out that some strains of Y. enterocolitica showed bacteriocinogenic properties at 25 degrees C, 30 degrees C and 37 degrees C irrespective of the presence of manganese ions in medium. In the presence of iron ions these strains showed bacteriocinogenic properties only at 25 degrees C. Y. enterocolitica strains which required Mn2+ or Mn7+ ions for bacteriocins production showed this activity only at 25 degrees C but in presence of Fe3+ ions they had no bacteriocinogenic properties. The partially purified jersiniacin 44JPSBKOH is a protein, its molecular weight was estimated to be 40 kDa. Yersiniacin 44JPSBKOH was active in the pH range of 3 to 9. Its bactericidal activity was rapidly lost when heated to 100 degrees C and treated with proteolytic enzymes. Yersiniacin 44JPSBKOH showed bactericidal activity against other Y. enterocolitica strains and some strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from humans.
TI  - Norepinephrine stimulates in vitro growth but does not increase pathogenicity of  Salmonella choleraesuis in an in vivo model.
AB  - Norepinephrine stimulates growth of Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in serum-supplemented media, and in vivo increases in norepinephrine may be important in the pathogenesis of sepsis by gram-negative bacteria. Because salmonellosis often is associated with stress, the effects of norepinephrine on in vitro growth, and in vivo pathogenicity of the swine pathogen Salmonella choleraesuis were investigated. When RPMI 1640 with and without pig serum was inoculated with fewer than 100 S. choleraesuis/ml and incubated overnight, bacterial numbers were 10(4) to 10(6) lower in RPMI containing serum. Norepinephrine restored bacterial growth in RPMI with serum to normal levels, but it did not increase growth in serum-free RPMI. Similar results were obtained with SAPI, a nutrient-poor medium previously used to study the effect of norepinephrine on growth of gram-negative bacteria. Conditioned media were produced by growing S. choleraesuis in RPMI containing serum with and without norepinephrine and filter sterilizing. Conditioned medium produced with norepinephrine stimulated growth of S. choleraesuis but not E. coli, whereas conditioned medium produced without norepinephrine stimulated growth of both bacteria. To determine the in vivo effects of norepinephrine, rats were implanted with tablets that secrete norepinephrine for 20 to 24 hours or with identical tablets without norepinephrine and infected intraperitoneally with graded doses of S. choleraesuis. The LD-50 of S. choleraesuis was the same in both groups, and norepinephrine did not affect the carrier rate at 30 days after infection. We concluded that although norepinephrine stimulates in vitro growth of S. choleraesuis in serum-based media, the increase in norepinephrine levels in the present in vivo system was probably not sufficient to influence the pathogenesis of S. choleraesuis infection.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of L4-mediated autogenous control of the S10 ribosomal protein operon.
AB  - We investigated the regulation of the S10 ribosomal protein (r-protein) operon among members of the gamma subdivision of the proteobacteria, which includes Escherichia coli. In E. coli, this 11-gene operon is autogenously controlled by r-protein L4. This regulation requires specific determinants within the untranslated leader of the mRNA. Secondary structure analysis of the S10 leaders of five enterobacteria (Salmonella typhimurium, Citrobacter freundii, Yersinia enterocolitica, Serratia marcescens, and Morganella morganii) and two nonenteric members of the gamma subdivision (Haemophilus influenzae and Vibrio cholerae) shows that these foreign leaders share significant structural homology with the E. coli leader, particularly in the region which is critical for L4-mediated autogenous control in E. coli. Moreover, these heterologous leaders produce a regulatory response to L4 oversynthesis in E. coli. Our results suggest that an E. coli-like L4-mediated regulatory mechanism may operate in all of these species. However, the mechanism is not universally conserved among the gamma subdivision members, since at least one, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, does not contain the required S10 leader features, and its leader cannot provide the signals for regulation by L4 in E. coli. We speculate that L4-mediated autogenous control developed during the evolution of the gamma branch of proteobacteria.
TI  - Induction of cytokine synthesis by flagella from gram-negative bacteria may be dependent on the activation or differentiation state of human monocytes.
AB  - We have previously demonstrated that salmonellae, but not Escherichia coli or Yersinia enterocolitica, stimulates tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) production in the human promonocytic cell line U38. Subsequent analysis revealed that the TNFalpha-inducing activity of salmonellae was associated with flagellin, a major component of flagella from gram-negative bacteria. In the present study, we have explored the basis for the apparent specificity of action of Salmonella flagella on TNFalpha expression in U38 cells and have extended this analysis to normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Flagella from the enteropathogenic E. coli strain E2348/69, Y. enterocolitica JB580, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, which did not induce significant levels of TNFalpha production in U38 cells, were as potent as Salmonella flagella in terms of TNFalpha and interleukin 1beta activation in PBMC. However, TNFalpha production in U38 cells was greatly enhanced when these cells were stimulated with flagella from E. coli, Y. enterocolitica, and P. aeruginosa in the presence of a costimulant, phorbol 13-myristate acetate. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the activation or differentiation state of a monocyte may have a substantial effect on the cell's responsiveness to flagellum stimulation of cytokine synthesis. Furthermore, these results indicate that cytokine induction in monocytes may be a general property of flagella from gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - A complex composed of SycN and YscB functions as a specific chaperone for YopN in Yersinia pestis.
AB  - Human pathogenic Yersinia resist host defences, in part through the expression and delivery of a set of plasmid-encoded virulence proteins termed Yops. A number of these Yops are exported from the bacteria directly into the cytoplasm of their eukaryotic host's cells upon contact with these cells. The secreted YopN protein (also known as LcrE) is required to block Yop secretion in the presence of calcium in vitro or before contact with a eukaryotic cell in vivo. In this study, we characterize the role of the tyeA, sycN and yscB gene products in the regulation of Yop secretion in Yersinia pestis. Mutants specifically defective in the expression of TyeA, SycN or YscB were no longer able to block Yop secretion in the presence of calcium. In addition, the secretion of YopN was specifically reduced in both the sycN and the yscB deletion mutants. Protein cross-linking and immunoprecipitation studies in conjunction with yeast two-hybrid analyses showed that SycN and YscB interact with one another to form a SycN/YscB complex. Yeast three-hybrid analyses demonstrated that the SycN/YscB complex, but not SycN or YscB alone, specifically associates with YopN. SycN and YscB share amino acid sequence similarity and structural similarities with the specific Yop chaperones SycE and SycH. Together, these results indicate that a complex composed of SycN and YscB functions as a specific chaperone for YopN in Y. pestis.
TI  - [Electron microscopic study of pathogenic bacteria on environmental objects].
AB  - The morphological picture of different bacteria (Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus  vulgaris, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia enterocolitica O3, Y.pseudotuberculosis 1, Y.frederiksenii, Y.intermedia, Y.kristensenii) on environmental objects was studied with the use of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Bacteria adhered to the surface of pieces of fodder, egg shell, cabbage leaves and form microcolonies, whose morphology was similar to colonies, grown on nutrient media. The cells produced extracellular substances, seen in SEM as integuments. These integuments were gourd to protect the population from the action of unfavorable factors.
TI  - The regulated outer membrane protein Omp21 from Comamonas acidovorans is identified as a member of a new family of eight-stranded beta-sheet proteins by its sequence and properties.
AB  - Omp21, a minor outer membrane protein of the soil bacterium Comamonas acidovorans, was purified from a spontaneous mutant lacking a surface layer and long-chain lipopolysaccharide. Omp21 synthesis is enhanced by oxygen depletion, and the protein has a variable electrophoretic mobility in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis due to its heat-modifiable behavior. The structural gene omp21 encodes a precursor of 204 amino acids with a putative signal peptide of 21 amino acids. Mature Omp21 is a typical outer membrane protein with a high content of beta structure as determined by infrared spectroscopy. Sequence comparisons show that it belongs to a new outer membrane protein family, characterized by eight amphipathic beta strands, which includes virulence proteins, such as the neisserial opacity proteins, Salmonella typhimurium Rck, and Yersinia enterocolitica Ail, as well as the major outer membrane proteins OmpA from Escherichia coli and OprF from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance of bacterial litter isolates.
AB  - Use of antibiotics in subtherapeutic doses as growth-promoting feed additives for animal production is widespread in the U.S. and throughout the world. Previous studies by our research group concluded that size fractionation of poultry (broiler) litter followed by storage facilitated reutilization of litter as a soil amendment or bedding supplement. However, litter microbial contamination, including antibiotic-resistant populations, and accumulation of metals and other elements may limit litter reutilization. Litter from four broiler houses was separated into a fine fraction for use as a soil amendment, and a coarse fraction for reutilization as a bedding supplement in growing subsequent flocks of broilers. Fractions and whole litter were stored in indoor piles simulating farm storage conditions for 4 mo with periodic analysis for metals, other elements, and culturable bacteria (including total and fecal coliform, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Campylobacter jejuni). Representative bacterial isolates were tested for their sensitivity to 12 common antibiotics (ampicillin, bacitracin, cephalothin, erythromycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, neomycin, penicillin, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline) using the Kirby-Bauer technique. Pathogens and indicator bacteria tested were found to be resistant to multiple antibiotics. Data suggest that microbial contamination of litter should be reduced or eliminated prior to reutilization to minimize environmental health risks related to transfer of antibiotic-resistant bacteria to humans or other animals.
TI  - RfaH and the ops element, components of a novel system controlling bacterial transcription elongation.
AB  - The RfaH protein controls the transcription of a specialized group of Escherichia coli and Salmonella operons that direct the synthesis, assembly and export of the lipopolysaccharide core, exopolysaccharide, F conjugation pilus and haemolysin toxin. RfaH is a specific regulator of transcript elongation; its loss increases transcription polarity in these operons without affecting initiation from the operon promoters. The operons of the RfaH-dependent regulon contain a short conserved 5' sequence, the ops element, deletion of which increases operon polarity to an extent similar to that caused by loss of RfaH. The ops element is also present upstream of polysaccharide gene clusters of Shigella flexneri, Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio cholerae and Klebsiella pneumoniae and the RP4 fertility operon of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, suggesting that this is a widely spread control system. The mechanistic coupling of RfaH and the ops element has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo, and we suggest that the ops element recruits RfaH and potentially other factors to the RNA polymerase complex, modifying the complex to increase its processivity and allowing transcription to proceed over long distances.
TI  - Production and characterisation of monoclonal antibodies to heat-shock protein 60 of Helicobacter pylori.
AB  - Two monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), designated as H9 (IgG2a) and H20 (IgM), directed against heat-shock protein 60 (HSP60) of Helicobacter pylori strain TK1029 were established. Affinity-purified antigens cross-reacted in immunoblots with MAb H9 and MAb H20 respectively. These antigens also reacted with the 3C8 MAb previously established in this laboratory, which recognised Yersinia enterocolitica HSP60. By amino-acid sequence analysis, the N-terminal amino-acid sequence of the protein recognised by both H9 and H20 MAbs was confirmed as the amino-acid sequence of H. pylori HSP60 reported previously. Both MAbs reacted with nine strains of H. pylori in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblot analysis. In addition, MAb H9 reacted with extracts of other bacteria including H. mustelae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vibrio cholerae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Shigella sonnei. In contrast, MAb H20 reacted only with strains H. pylori. These results suggest that both the species-specific epitope recognised by MAb H20 and the common epitope recognised by MAb H9 exist on HSP60 of the bacterial cell. Both MAbs also reacted with the 60-kDa protein in the lysate of human gastric carcinoma (MKN45) cells. It was shown by immunohistochemical staining that gastric epithelial cells of four out of six biopsy specimens examined stained positively with MAb H20. These results suggest that there is a common epitope in H. pylori HSP60 and human gastric epithelial cells.
TI  - Characterization of two plasmid-borne lps beta loci of Rhizobium etli required for lipopolysaccharide synthesis and for optimal interaction with plants.
AB  - In Rhizobium etli CFN42, both the symbiotic plasmid (pd) and plasmid b (pb) are required for effective bean nodulation. This is due to the presence on pb of a region (lps beta) involved in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis. We report here the genetic array and functional features of this plasmid-borne region. The sequence analysis of a 3,595-bp fragment revealed the presence of a transcriptional unit integrated by two open reading frames (lps beta 1 and lps beta 2) essential for LPS biosynthesis and symblosis. The lps beta 1 encodes a putative 193 amino acid polypeptide that shows strong homology with glucosyl-1P and galactosyl-1P transferases. The deduced amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by lps beta 2 was very similar to that of proteins involved in surface polysaccharide biosynthesis, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa WpbM, Bordetella pertussis BpIL, and Yersinia enterocolitica TrsG. DNA sequences homologous to lps beta 1 and lps beta 2 of R. etli CFN42 were consistently found in functionally equivalent plasmids of R. etli, R. leguminosarum bv. viciae, and R. leguminosarum hv. trifolii strains, but not in R. meliloti, R. loti, R. tropici, R. fredii, Bradyrhizobium, Azorhizobium, and Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Even though Rhizobium and Agrobacterium do not share lps beta sequences, their presence is required for crown-gall tumor induction by R. etli transconjugants carrying the Ti plasmid.
TI  - Occurrence of gram-negative bacteria in drinking water undergoing softening treatment.
AB  - A study was carried out on the presence of Gram-negative bacteria in the municipal waters of Bologna (Italy) undergoing softening using domestic ion exchangers with an automatic disinfection mechanism. The softening process was seen to cause a 15 fold increase in 22 degrees C and 36 degrees C heterotrophic plate counts. There was a 30 fold increase in Gram-negative bacteria and their number correlated directly with temperature and inversely with active residual chlorine. Organic matter had no effect on bacterial growth. The most commonly found bacteria were various species of Pseudomonas (87.6%) (Ps. acidovorans, Ps. denitrificans, Ps. fluorescens and Ps. testosteroni) followed by Aeromonas hydrophila (5.6%) and Stenotrophomonas (Xantomonas) maltophilia (3.8% in outgoing water). Pseudomonas aeruginosa (present in 5.6% of incoming water samples and 0.4% of outgoing water) and Yersinia enterocolitica (present in 4.3% of incoming water samples and 1.1% of outgoing water) did not find favorable conditions for growth on the ion exchange resins.
TI  - Comparative sensitivity of 13 species of pathogenic bacteria to seven chemical germicides.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relative resistance of diverse human bacterial pathogens to commonly used germicidal agents has not been established. METHODS: We measured by titration the survival of thirteen different bacteria after exposure to glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, cupric ascorbate, sodium hypochlorite, or phenol. RESULTS: Our comparative experiments allowed classification of the organisms' survival into four groups: (a) Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus showed the most resistance, (b) Clostridium perfringens, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 showed intermediate resistance, (c) Listeria monocytogenes, Shigella sonnei, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus survived some treatments with chemical agents only in the presence of protecting protein (serum albumin), and (d) Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio vulnificus, Bacillus cereus, and Yersinia enterocolitica did not survive any of the treatments applied. CONCLUSION: We found species that more frequently survived exposure to germicidal agents were also those most commonly reported in association with hospital infections. Our findings suggest that resistance to disinfectants may be more important than pathogenicity in determining the relative prominence of an organism as an agent responsible for nosocomial infections.
TI  - A bifunctional urease enhances survival of pathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica and Morganella morganii at low pH.
AB  - To infect a susceptible host, the gastrointestinal pathogen Yersinia enterocolitica must survive passage through the acid environment of the stomach. In this study, we showed that Y. enterocolitica serotype O8 survives buffered acidic conditions as low as pH 1.5 for long periods of time provided urea is available. Acid tolerance required an unusual cytoplasmically located urease that was activated 780-fold by low-pH conditions. Acid tolerance of Helicobacter species has also been attributed to urease activity, but in that case urease was not specifically activated by low-pH conditions. A ure mutant strain of Y. enterocolitica was constructed which was hypersensitive to acidic conditions when urea was available and, unlike the parental strain, was unable to grow when urea was the sole nitrogen source. Examination of other urease-producing gram-negative bacteria indicated that Morganella morganii survives in acidic conditions but Escherichia coli 1021, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa do not. Consistent with these results, biochemical evidence demonstrated that Y. enterocolitica and M. morganii ureases were activated in vitro by low pH with an unusually low activity optimum of pH 5.5. In whole cells activation occurred as medium values decreased below pH 3.0 for Y. enterocolitica and pH 5.5 for M. morganii, suggesting that in vivo activation occurs as a result of cytoplasmic acidification. DNA sequence analysis of portions of the M. morganii ure locus showed that the predicted primary structure of the enzyme structural subunits is most similar to those of Y. enterocolitica urease. One region of similarity between these two ureases located near the active site is distinct from most other ureases but is present in the urease of Lactobacillus fermentum. This region of similarity may be responsible for the unique properties of the Y. enterocolitica and M. morganii ureases since the L. fermentum urease also has been shown to have a low pH optimum for activity.
TI  - A simple gel electrophoretic method for analyzing the muropeptide composition of  bacterial peptidoglycan.
AB  - The muropeptide composition of bacterial peptidoglycan is currently most efficiently determined by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Though sensitive, the HPLC procedure is technically demanding and has been applied to a relatively small number of bacterial strains and species. We have found that fluorescence-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE) is a simple, rapid method by which reducing muropeptides from multiple peptidoglycan samples can be visualized. Individual reducing muropeptides were covalently labeled with the fluorescent molecule 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid, after which they were separated by electrophoresis through a 35% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by exposure to UV light. FACE detected the appropriate numbers of reducing muropeptides in the proper proportions for four bacteria: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, and Yersinia enterocolitica. As little as 2 to 5 pmol per muropeptide was detected when the intensity of the fluorescent signal was measured with a charge-coupled device camera, at a level of sensitivity between 50 and 250 times higher than that of the classic HPLC technique. Thus, FACE may be used to identify interesting peptidoglycan samples prior to more-extensive analysis by HPLC, or FACE may eventually replace HPLC for some applications.
TI  - Physical and structural characterization of yersiniophore, a siderophore produced by clinical isolates of Yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  - Clinical isolates of Yersinia enterocolitca, which belong to mouse-lethal serotypes, produce the siderophore yersiniophore. Siderophore production was shown to be iron regulated and to reach maximum production in late log phase. Yersiniophore is a fluorescent siderophore with maximum excitation at 270 nm and a major emission peak at 428 nm. Absorption maxima were seen at 210 and 250 nm with a low broad peak from 280 to 320 nm. Purification of unchelated yersiniophore for structural analysis was made difficult by low yields (1-2 mg mg-1), and susceptibility to acid hydrolysis, oxidation and possibly polymerization. Yersinophore was therefore purified as an Al3+ chelate, which was found to be stable in solution for several weeks. To purify Al(3+)-yersinophore, unchelated yersiniophore was first extracted from culture supernatants with dichloromethane, concentrated by rotary evaporation and adsorbed to a DEAE-sephacel column. Al(3+)-yersiniophore was eluted with 0.01 M AlCl3 and further purified by HPLC. The structure was established by a combination of elemental analysis, high resolution mass spectrometry and two-dimensional NMR experiments. Yersiniophore is a phenolate-thiazole siderophore with the formula C21H24N3O4S3Al and a molecular weight of 505.07404 when chelated to Al3+. The structure of yersiniophore was determined to be closely related to the structures of pyochelin, produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and anguibactin, produced by Vibrio anguillarum.
TI  - [Water disinfection: comparative activities of ozone and chlorine on a wide spectrum of bacteria].
AB  - Ozone and chlorine are agents that disinfect by destroying, neutralizing or inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microorganisms. The treatment of drinking water with ozone has shown to be more efficient against spores of Bacillus subtilis. It was observed that the ozone already in dose of 0.35 mg/l produced the reduction of at least 5 log in populations of approximately 1 x 10(6) cells/ml of Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella typhi, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophila, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. With a dose of 0.50 mg/l of chlorine, the reduction was much smaller for the tested microorganisms (except Vibrio cholerae), while the effect of 2 mg/l of chlorine was similar to the ozone treatment. For spores of Bacillus subtilis, the reduction observed with ozone concentrations of 0.35 and 0.70 mg/l was of almost 3 log, while no considerable effect was obtained with chlorine in the tested conditions. Our results have shown that both disinfectans were consumed during the treatment period, probably because of the own water demand and the added bacterial mass.
TI  - A comparative study of the BBL crystal enteric/nonfermenter identification system and the biomerieux API20E and API20NE identification systems after overnight incubation.
AB  - The BBL Crystal Enteric/Nonfermenter (Crystal, Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems) is a new multi-test identification system for Gram negative rods requiring no oil overlay or addition of reagents. One hundred and three selected Gram negative rod isolates from routine clinical specimens were tested in parallel using the appropriate API20E or API20NE (BioMerieux) reading after overnight incubation. The isolates included in the study, and the number tested, were as follows: Acinetobacter sp, 8; Aeromonas hydrophila, 1; Citrobacter diversus, 1; Citrobacter freundii, 1; Escherichia coli, 13; Enterobacter aerogenes, 10; Enterobacter agglomerans, 2; Enterobacter cloacae, 6; Klebsiella oxytoca, 6; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 12; Morganella morganii, 2; Proteus mirabilis, 6; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21; Salmonella sp, 2; Salmonella typhi, 1; Serratia marcescens, 1; Shigella sonnei, 2; Shigella sp, 2; Vibrio metschnikovii, 1; Xanthomonas maltophilia, 3; and, Yersinia enterocolitica, 2. The API20E and API20NE systems combined identified 74.8% (77/103) and the Crystal 97.1% (100/103) of isolates. Twenty six isolates required repeat and/or additional tests for correct identification with the API systems compared to 3 with the Crystal. Crystal is more convenient than API for routine clinical use because it requires fewer repeat and/or extra tests, and is easier and less time consuming to use.
TI  - Efficacy of ozonated water against various food-related microorganisms.
AB  - The antimicrobial effects of ozonated water in a recirculating concurrent reactor were evaluated against four gram-positive and four gram-negative bacteria, two yeasts, and spores of Aspergillus niger. More than 5 log units each of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli cells were killed instantaneously in ozonated water with or without addition of 20 ppm of soluble starch (SS). In ozonated water, death rates among the gram-negative bacteria--S. typhimurium, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Yersinia enterocolitica--were not significantly different (P > 0.05). Among gram-positive bacteria, Listeria monocytogenes was significantly P < 0.05) more sensitive than either Staphylococcus aureus or Enterococcus faecalis. In the presence of organic material, death rates of S. aureus compared with L. monocytogenes and E. coli compared with S. typhimurium in ozonated water were not significantly (P > 0.05) affected by SS addition but were significantly reduced (P < 0.05) by addition of 20 ppm of bovine serum albumin (BSA). More than 4.5 log units each of Candida albicans and Zygosaccharomyces bailii cells were killed instantaneously in ozonated water, whereas less than 1 log unit of Aspergillus niger spores was killed after a 5-min exposure. The average ozone output levels in the deionized water (0.188 mg/ml) or water with SS (0.198 mg/ml) did not differ significantly (P < 0.05) but were significantly lower in water containing BSA (0.149 mg/ml).
TI  - Analyses of the DNA-binding and transcriptional activation properties of ExsA, the transcriptional activator of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa exoenzyme S regulon.
AB  - ExsA has been implicated as a central regulator of exoenzyme S production by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this study, the DNA-binding and transcriptional activation properties of ExsA were investigated. ExsA was produced and purified as a fusion protein, MALA3A2, which was shown to bind specifically to promoter regions that regulated transcription of the exoenzyme S trans-regulatory locus (pC) and a locus located directly downstream of exsA (pD). Previously, MALA3A2 was shown to bind the exoS 5' PstI-NsiI region, which contained two independent but coordinately regulated (ExsA-mediated) promoters, pS' (now termed pORF1) and pS. DNase I footprint analysis of the promoter regions bound by ExsA revealed a common protected consensus sequence of TXAAAAXA. The consensus sequence was located -51 to -52 bp upstream of the transcriptional start sites for pD, pS, and pORF1. Promoter fusion, DNA-binding, and mutagenesis analysis indicated that the consensus sequence was important for transcriptional activation. Each ExsA-controlled promoter region contained at least two consensus sites in close proximity, similar to the arrangement of half-sites seen in AraC-controlled (Escherichia coli) or VirF-controlled (Yersinia enterocolitica) promoters. However, the results of this study suggested that only one consensus site was required in the exoenzyme S (pS) or ORF1 promoter (pORF1) to initiate transcription. These data suggest that members of the exoenzyme S regulon can be defined as possessing an ExsA consensus element which maps at bp -51 or -52 relative to the transcriptional start site.
TI  - VirG, a Yersinia enterocolitica lipoprotein involved in Ca2+ dependency, is related to exsB of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Pathogenic yersiniae require Ca2+ for growth at 37 degrees C. They harbor closely related plasmids of about 70 kb that are essential for virulence. At 37 degrees C and in the absence of Ca2+ ions, these plasmids cause a decrease in growth rate and the release of large amounts of proteins called Yops. Here we describe the virG gene of Yersinia enterocolitica; virG is located just upstream of the virF gene, which encodes the transcriptional activator of some plasmid virulence factors. Analysis of the VirG amino acid sequence suggested that virG encodes a lipoprotein, which was confirmed by [3H]palmitate labeling of VirG-PhoA fusion proteins. A nonpolar virG mutant was constructed and found to be Ca2+ independent for growth at 37 degrees C but to still secrete Yops. This phenotype was complemented by the introduction of a plasmid harboring an intact virG gene. VirG was found to be homologous to ExsB, a protein encoded by a Pseudomonas aeruginosa gene located in the locus controlling exoenzyme S synthesis. Interestingly, the exsA gene, located just downstream of exsB, is also homologous to virF.
TI  - The bacterial 'enigma': cracking the code of cell-cell communication.
AB  - In recent years it has become clear that the production of N-acyl homoserine lactones (N-AHLs) is widespread in Gram-negative bacteria. These molecules act as diffusible chemical communication signals (bacterial pheromones) which regulate diverse physiological processes including bioluminescence, antibiotic production, plasmid conjugal transfer and synthesis of exoenzyme virulence factors in plant and animal pathogens. The paradigm for N-AHL production is in the bioluminescence (lux) phenotype of Photobacterium fischeri (formerly classified as Vibrio fischeri) where the signalling molecule N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (OHHL) is synthesized by the action of the LuxI protein. OHHL is thought to bind to the LuxR protein, allowing it to act as a positive transcriptional activator in an autoinduction process that physiologically couples cell density (and growth phase) to the expression of the bioluminescence genes. Based on the growing information on LuxI and LuxR homologues in other N-AHL-producing bacterial species such as Erwinia carotovora, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia enterocolitica, Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Rhizobium leguminosarum, it seems that analogues of the P. fischeri lux autoinducer sensing system are widely distributed in bacteria. The general physiological function of these simple chemical signalling systems appears to be the modulation of discrete and diverse metabolic processes in concert with cell density. In an evolutionary sense, the elaboration and action of these bacterial pheromones can be viewed as an example of multicellularity in prokaryotic populations.
TI  - Characterization of an LysR family protein, SmeR from Serratia marcescens S6, its effect on expression of the carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase Sme-1, and comparison of this regulator with other beta-lactamase regulators.
AB  - Serratia marcescens S6 produces a chromosomally encoded carbapenem-hydrolyzing class A beta-lactamase, Sme-1 (T. Naas, L. Vandel, W. Sougakoff, D. M. Livermore, and P. Nordmann, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 38:1262-1270, 1994). Upstream from smeA we identified a second open reading frame (EMBL accession number Z30237). This encodes a 33.1-kDa protein, SmeR, which has a high degree of homology with NmcR, the LysR regulatory protein of the only other sequenced carbapenem-hydrolyzing class A beta-lactamase, NmcA from Enterobacter cloacae NOR-1. It is weakly related to AmpR of the chromosomal cephalosporinase regulatory systems described in E. cloacae, Yersinia enterocolitica, Citrobacter freundii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and is very weakly related to other LysR-type regulators of class A beta-lactamases. SmeR is a weakly positive regulator for Sme-1 expression in the absence of or in the presence of beta-lactam inducers. The -35 and -10 regions of smeR are in the opposite orientations and are face-to-face relative to the smeA promoter. SmeR acts similarly to NmcR and not as the AmpR regulators described for class C beta-lactamase systems. SmeR is a weak inducer in the absence or presence of beta-lactams. As was found for the AmpC-AmpR and NmcA-NmcR systems, a putative SmeR-binding site was present upstream from the beta-lactamase gene promoter regions. beta-Galactosidase activity from a smeR-lacZ translational fusion was expressed constitutively and decreased in the presence of SmeR from a coresident plasmid, suggesting that SmeR is autogeneously controlled. Finally, beta-lactams did not affect the expression of SmeR, which is the second regulator of a class A carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase to be identified.
TI  - The fate of potentially pathogenic bacteria in Swiss hard and semihard cheeses made from raw milk.
AB  - This study examined the ability of potentially pathogenic bacteria to grow and to survive during the manufacture and ripening of Swiss hard and semihard cheese varieties made from raw milk. The results show that hard cheeses are hygienically safe; 1 wk after fabrication, the inoculated pathogens (Aeromonas hydrophila. Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Yersinia enterocolitica) could no longer be detected. At the age of commercial ripeness, the semihard cheeses were free from the inoculated pathogens and their toxic metabolites, except for L. monocytogenes, which survived the manufacturing and ripening process.
TI  - Variability of peptidoglycan structural parameters in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Muropeptide composition of peptidoglycan from the Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas sp., Acinetobacter acetoaceticus, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Vibrio parahaemolyticus Yersinia enterocolitica and Escherichia coli, was analyzed by HPLC. In all instances peptidoglycan was built up from the same subunits. A wide disparity in the relative abundance of muropeptides and all structural parameters was observed. The contribution of LD-A2pm-A2pm cross-linked muropeptides was extremely variable; from 1 to 45% of cross-linked muropeptides. Muropeptides with the dipeptides Lys-Lys or Arg-Lys, indicative of murein-bound (lipo)proteins, were detected in all instances although abundance was very variable.
TI  - Evaluation of different antimicrobial agents used as selective supplements for isolation and recovery of Yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  - Seventeen antimicrobial agents were evaluated separately or in combination for their efficiency as selective supplements in a broth medium against six different serotypes of Yersinia enterocolitica and 20 selected strains of different Gram-negative bacteria. Irgasan (DP300, 5-chloro-2-(2,4- dichlorophenoxy) phenol) at a concentration of 4 micrograms ml-1 inhibited the growth of most Gram-negative bacteria with the exceptions of Aeromonas hydrophila, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia liquefaciens. Other antimicrobial agents incorporated in the growth medium, separately or in combination with Irgasan, either inhibited some strains of Y. enterocolitica or did not inhibit the growth of Irgasan-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Photochemical inactivation of pathogenic bacteria in human platelet concentrates.
AB  - Platelet concentrates (PC) may be infrequently contaminated with low levels of bacteria that can cause septicemia and death in patients receiving transfusion therapy. We evaluated the efficacy of a photochemical decontamination (PCD) technique using 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) and long wavelength UV light (UVA) to inactivate bacteria in standard therapeutic PC. Twelve phylogenetically distinct pathogenic bacteria, 5 gram-positive and 7 gram-negative organisms, were seeded into PC to a final challenge dose ranging from 10(5) to 10(7) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. Contaminated PC were treated with 8-MOP (5 micrograms/mL) and 5 J/cm2 of UVA, a PCD treatment regimen found to adequately preserve in vitro platelet function. Greater than 10(5) CFU/mL of all 5 gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium minutissimum) and 2 of the gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Yersinia enterocolitica) organisms were inactivated. The remaining 5 gram-negative organisms were more resistant, with less than 10(1) to 10(3.7) CFU/mL inactivated under these conditions. The inactivation efficiency for this resistant group of gram-negative organisms was improved when PC were resuspended in a synthetic storage medium with reduced plasma protein concentration (15%) and an increased 8-MOP concentration (23.4 micrograms/mL). Illumination with 3 J/cm2 of UVA in this system inactivated greater than 10(5) CFU/mL of 4 resistant gram-negative organisms (Salmonella choleraesuis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and 10(4.1) CFU/mL of the most resistant gram-negative organism (Pseudomonas aeruginosa). This level of PCD treatment did not adversely affect in vitro platelet function. These results demonstrate that PCD using 8-MOP (5 to 23.4 micrograms/mL) effectively inactivated high levels of pathogenic bacteria in PC with adequate preservation of in vitro platelet properties.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of biapenem, a new carbapenem antibiotic.
AB  - Biapenem is a new carbapenem antibiotic with high stability to human renal dehydropeptidase I. Its in vitro activity was compared with that of imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, piperacillin and gentamicin against a total of 650 recent clinical isolates. MICs were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and all isolates were tested at two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu). Biapenem inhibited 90% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia stuartii, Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella typhi, Shigella sonnei and Yersinia enterocolitica at < or = 2 mg/l and was as active as or two- to four-fold more active than imipenem against all these species, with the exception of Serratia marcescens, against which imipenem was two-fold more active. Biapenem was two-fold more active than imipenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 4 mg/l) and had activity similar to that of imipenem against the Bacteroides fragilis group (MIC90 0.5 mg/l) but was two-fold less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90 0.06 mg/l) and was, like imipenem, inactive against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Microbiological status of rabbit carcases in Egypt.
AB  - A total of 40 New Zealand white rabbits, 20 freshly slaughtered rabbits from an experimental farm and 20 processed rabbit carcases from grocery stores in Beni-Suef city, were examined bacteriologically. The mean values of aerobic plate counts at 37 degrees C and 1 degrees C, Enterobacteriaceae counts, Pseudomonas counts and Staphylococcus counts of freshly slaughtered rabbits were 10(4) +/- 2 x 10(3), 8 x 10(2) +/- 10(2), 6 x 10(2) +/- 10(2), 3 x 10(2) +/- 10(2), and 10(2) +/- 60 organisms per gram respectively, whereas the equivalent values were 8 x 10(5) +/- 3 x 10(4), 2 x 10(5) +/- 10(4), 4 x 10(4) +/- 8 x 10(3), 2 x 10(4) +/- 6 x 10(3), and 4 x 10(3) +/- 4 x 10(2) organisms per gram of processed rabbit carcases from grocery stores, respectively. The freshly slaughtered rabbits showed a low bacterial load compared with processed rabbit carcases from grocery stores. Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes could be isolated from the rabbit carcases examined in addition to Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus from processed rabbit carcases. Yersinia enterocolitica could not be isolated from any sample examined. Suggested measures to reduce the microbial load in rabbit carcases are discussed.
TI  - Antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin B, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the N-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  - A physiologically diverse range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin B, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. The list of susceptible organisms includes Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens. Concentrations of lactoferricin B required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and the culture medium used. The peptide showed activity against E. coli O111 over the range of pH 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. Its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of Na+, K+, Mg2+ or Ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. Lactoferricin B was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterococcus faecalis and Bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.
TI  - MHC-unrestricted recognition of bacteria-infected target cells by human CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes.
AB  - A CD8+ alpha beta TCR+ T cell clone (A35) was isolated from the synovial fluid of a patient with post-enteric reactive arthritis caused by Yersinia enterocolitica. This clone efficiently killed autologous and allogeneic target cells that had been preincubated with live but not with heat-killed bacteria. There was no restriction by polymorphic parts of HLA-A, -B, or -C molecules and a HLA class II-deficient mutant cell line was lysed as efficiently as its normal counterpart, whereas infected HLA class I-deficient cells (Daudi cells) were not. The clone showed crossreaction between Yersinia enterocolitica, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pyogenes, but did not lyse target cells preincubated with Staphylococcus epidermidis. MAb to CD2, CD3, and CD8 efficiently blocked A35, whereas the addition of mAb to HLA class II or to HLA class I did not. This clone apparently represents a novel effector mechanism against bacteria-infected or -modified cells that could be involved in the immunopathology of reactive arthritis.
TI  - Cross-reactive proteins of Borrelia burgdorferi.
AB  - The specificity of serological tests for Lyme borreliosis is impaired by cross-reacting antibodies. In order to select antigens for more specific tests, specific and cross-reactive proteins of Borrelia burgdorferi must be identified. Therefore, to analyze cross reactions of Borrelia burgdorferi with other bacteria, rabbit immune sera against heterologous bacteria (Borrelia hermsii, Treponema pallidum, Treponema phagedenis, Leptospira interrogans (serogroup grippotyphosa), Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Yersinia enterocolitica (serotypes O3 and O9), Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes O1, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri and Legionella micdadei) were examined by Western blot using Borrelia burgdorferi as antigen. Broad cross reactivity was shown for Borrelia proteins of the 60-75 kDa range. Other broadly cross-reacting proteins were at the level of p40, p33 and two proteins in the range of 20 kDa. Some of the cross reactions were eliminated by absorption of the sera with Treponema phagedenis. The absorbed antibodies were directed mainly against bands at the level of p33 and bands of the 60 to 75 kDa range. Showing the lowest potential for cross reactivity, p100, p41, OspA and pC seem to be the most suitable antigens for serodiagnosis. In contrast to p100 and OspA, however, p41 and pC showed cross reactivity with immune sera against bacteria not belonging to the genus Borrelia.
TI  - Catecholamine induced growth of gram negative bacteria.
AB  - The addition of various catecholamines to cultures of gram negative bacteria resulted in dramatic increases in growth. The ability of norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine and dopa to enhance the growth of Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was observed to be dependent on the bacterium employed with each strain showing marked preference for one or more of the catecholamines. Catecholamine induced increases in growth were confirmed by one or more of the following methods: uptake of tritiated thymidine into newly synthesized DNA, changes in optical density or pour plate analysis. None of the catecholamine metabolites resulting from either oxidative deamination or catechol-O-methylation were able to effect similar increases in bacterial growth as compared to either norepinephrine, epinephrine or dopamine. Norepinephrine was consistently observed to effect the greatest increase in bacterial growth for all strains tested.
TI  - Cloning and sequence analysis of a trans-regulatory locus required for exoenzyme  S synthesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Exoenzyme S is an ADP-ribosyltransferase enzyme distinct from exotoxin A that is  synthesized and secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Yields of exoenzyme S are variable and depend on strain and growth conditions. Since certain medium additives are required for exoenzyme S production, its regulation may be influenced by environmental stimuli. In this study, we have cloned a region that complements the exoenzyme S-deficient phenotype of strain 388 exs1::Tn1, a chromosomal Tn1 insertional mutation. A large clone (28 kb) was shown to restore both synthesis and secretory functions to the mutant strain. Subcloning and Tn501 mutagenesis experiments localized the region required for exoenzyme S synthesis to a 3.2-kb fragment. Nucleotide sequence analysis demonstrated several open reading frames. Comparison of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of purified exoenzyme S with predicted amino acid sequences of all open reading frames indicated that the structural gene was not encoded within the sequenced region. Homology studies suggested that the region encoded three regulatory genes, exsC, exsB, and exsA. ExsA was homologous to the AraC family of transcriptional activator proteins, with extensive homology being found with one member of this family, VirF of Yersinia enterocolitica. VirF and ExsA both contain carboxy-terminal domains with the helix-turn-helix motif of DNA-binding proteins. The ExsA gene product appeared to be required for induction of exoenzyme S synthesis above a low basal level. Expression of ExsA was demonstrated by cloning the region under the control of the T7 promoter. Gene replacement experiments suggested that the expression of ExsC affects the final yield of exoenzyme S.
TI  - Effects of high hydrostatic pressure on characteristics of pork slurries and inactivation of microorganisms associated with meat and meat products.
AB  - Pork slurries inoculated with various test microorganisms were prepared and subjected to high hydrostatic pressure at 1000 to 6000 atm for 10 min at 25 degrees C to examine for the pressure effects on characteristics of the slurries and the inactivation of the microorganisms associated with meat and meat products. Pressure treatment at higher than 3000 atm caused coagulation and discoloration of the pork slurries. Harder and more white coagulants were obtained by increasing the pressure. Pressure treatment at 3000 to 6000 atm killed all the microorganisms tested by more than 6-log colony-forming units (cfu)/g except Bacillus cereus spores. Gram-negative microorganisms were more labile to pressure than Gram-positive ones. Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium and Yersinia enterocolitica were inactivated at pressures higher than 3000 atm; Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida utilis at pressures higher than 4000 atm; Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis at 6000 atm. Only less than one-log cfu/g of B. cereus spores were inactivated at 6000 atm. Ultraviolet absorption spectra and acridine orange staining suggested that E. coli became permeable and leaked cytoplasmic RNA at lower pressure than S. aureus. From the present findings, the authors propose high hydrostatic pressure treatment as a promising means of preparing wholesome meat and meat products.
TI  - In vitro activity and stability against novel beta-lactamases of investigational  beta-lactams (cefepime, cefpirome, flomoxef, SCE2787 and piperacillin plus tazobactam) in comparison with established compounds (cefotaxime, latamoxef and piperacillin).
AB  - The therapeutic perspectives of flomoxef, SCE 2787, cefpirome, cefepime, latamoxef, cefotaxime and of piperacillin plus tazobactam were comparatively evaluated by their in vitro activity against 1119 clinical isolates of 83 bacterial species. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. Enterobacter sakazakii, Proteus spp. and Shigella spp. were about equally susceptible to the cephalosporins (MIC90: 0.06 to 0.5 mg/l), while the MIC90 for piperacillin plus tazobactam was between 2 and 16 mg/l. Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes and Serratia spp. were most susceptible to SCE 2787, cefpirome and cefepime (MIC90: 0.06 to 2 mg/l) followed by latamoxef, cefotaxime, flomoxef and piperacillin plus tazobactam. For Citrobacter spp., Providencia spp. and Yersinia enterocolitica MIC90 were between 0.06 and 0.5 mg/l. Flomoxef was between 2 to 4 log2 less active against these species but more active than piperacillin plus tazobactam (MIC90: 2 and 8 mg/l). Morganella morganii and Hafnia alvei were most susceptible to cefepime, cefpirome and latamoxef (MIC90: 0.13 to 0.5 mg/l) while cefotaxime (MIC90: 8 mg/l) and piperacillin plus tazobactam (MIC90: 8 and greater than 64 mg/l) were the least active compounds. SCE 2787, cefepime and cefpirome were the most potent beta-lactams against the majority of the 13 species of non-fermentative bacilli (NFB) investigated (MIC90: 0.5 to 16 mg/l). The oxacephems were the least active compounds against NFB. Cefepime was the most active of the compounds included against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90: 16 mg/l). Haemophilus spp., Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Bordetella pertussis were most susceptible to cefotaxime (MIC90: 0.03 to 0.06 mg/l). Latamoxef had the lowest activity of all compounds against gram-positive cocci. Flomoxef was the most active compound against penicillinase producing Staphylococcus aureus and about equally active as the other betalactams against methicillin susceptible staphylococci of other staphylococcal species.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Effects of room-temperature exposure on bacterial growth in stored red cells.
AB  - Experiments were performed to determine the effect of room-temperature (RT) exposure on the growth rates of selected bacteria by deliberate contamination of AS-1 packed red cell (RBC) units contained in PL146 plastic bags. Isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter agglomerans, and Yersinia enterocolitica were inoculated into 3- to 5-day-old packed RBC units. The units were refrigerated at 4 to 6 degrees C for 14 days. On two occasions during this period, one-half of the units were removed from the refrigerator and held at 25 to 26 degrees C for 2 hours. Timed samples taken during the periods at RT revealed stable or decreasing bacterial counts in the majority of exposed units, and in no instance was a marked increase in bacterial growth observed. Samples taken after subsequent prolonged rerefrigeration showed no significant increase in bacterial counts as compared with those in control units that were refrigerated constantly. These results indicate that RT exposure of contaminated RBC units does not result in accelerated bacterial proliferation over a period of 2 hours and that it may, in fact, have a detrimental effect on bacterial growth.
TI  - In-vitro activity of meropenem against clinical isolates obtained in Canada.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was compared with that of imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, gentamicin and, where appropriate, other antibiotics against recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. MICs were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. Meropenem inhibited 90% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens and Providencia stuartii at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l and was four- to 16-fold more active than imipenem against these species. Against the enteric pathogens Salmonella typhi, Shigella sonnei, Yersinia enterocolitica and Campylobacter jejuni, meropenem was four- to eight-fold more active than imipenem, inhibiting all isolates at less than or equal to 0.03 mg/l. Meropenem was also more active than imipenem against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 0.06 mg/l) but had similar activity against the Bacteroides fragilis group (MIC90 0.25 mg/l), against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 2 mg/l) and against streptococci. Imipenem was four-fold more active than meropenem against Acinetobacter spp. and two- to eight-fold more active against all species of staphylococci tested. Both meropenem and imipenem were inactive against Ps. (Xanthomonas) maltophilia.
TI  - [Antibacterial and bactericidal activities of Japanese green tea].
AB  - We found that extracts of Japanese green tea leaves inhibited the growth of various bacteria causing diarrheal diseases. All tea samples tested showed antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Vibrio cholerae O1, V. cholerae non O1. V. parahaemolyticus, V. mimicus, Campylobacter jejuni and Plesiomonas shigelloides. None of the tea samples had any effect on the growth of V. fluvialis, Aeromonas sobria, A. hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, enteroinvasive Escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli, enteropathogenic E. coli, enterotoxigenic E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae or Yersinia enterocolitica. Salmonella and Shigella showed susceptibilities different depending on the kind of Japanese green tea. Japanese green tea showed also bactericidal activity over S. aureus, V. parahaemolyticus and even enteropathogenic E. coli which was not sensitive when tested by cup method. The bactericidal activity was shown even at the drinking concentration in daily life.
TI  - Rapid enumeration of viable bacteria by image analysis.
AB  - A direct viable counting method for enumerating viable bacteria was modified and  made compatible with image analysis. A comparison was made between viable cell counts determined by the spread plate method and direct viable counts obtained using epifluorescence microscopy either manually or by automatic image analysis. Cultures of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Vibrio cholerae, Yersinia enterocolitica and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were incubated at 35 degrees C in a dilute nutrient medium containing nalidixic acid. Filtered samples were stained for epifluorescence microscopy and analysed manually as well as by image analysis. Cells enlarged after incubation were considered viable. The viable cell counts determined using image analysis were higher than those obtained by either the direct manual count of viable cells or spread plate methods. The volume of sample filtered or the number of cells in the original sample did not influence the efficiency of the method. However, the optimal concentration of nalidixic acid (2.5-20 micrograms ml-1) and length of incubation (4-8 h) varied with the culture tested. The results of this study showed that under optimal conditions, the modification of the direct viable count method in combination with image analysis microscopy provided an efficient and quantitative technique for counting viable bacteria in a short time.
TI  - Purification of cross-reacting protein antigen shared by Yersinia enterocolitica  and other gram-negative bacteria with monoclonal antibody.
AB  - A monoclonal antibody against the Yersinia enterocolitica 60-kilodalton (kDa) antigen, designated cross-reacting protein antigen (CRPA), was obtained by cell fusion. The CRPA common to gram-negative bacteria was purified from Y. enterocolitica by the affinity chromatography with the monoclonal antibody (IgG1) thus obtained. The purified CRPA showed a single band of 60 kDa in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and reacted with rabbit antisera against Y. enterocolitica, Vibrio cholerae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Shigella sonnei in Western blot analysis. The monoclonal antibody, however, reacted with a 60 kDa peptide from Y. enterocolitica, but not with the antigens from other gram-negative bacteria such as V. cholerae, E. coli, S. sonnei, Salmonella enteritidis, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa. The results suggested that both species-specific and cross-reactive epitopes were present on a CRPA molecule.
TI  - Associative growth of Yersinia enterocolitica 0:3 with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus in a diffusion apparatus. (Ecologen).
AB  - To evaluate associative growth of psychorotrophic P. aeruginosa and S. aureus with Y. enterocolitica 0:3, microorganisms were grown in trypticase soy broth in a diffusion apparatus (Ecologen) and incubated for 9 days at 4 degrees C. The effects of culture interactions were determined by growth curves, lag times, generation times, pH changes and acid production. The observed growth curves for Y. enterocolitica 0:3, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, shows the stimulating effects of Y. enterocolitica 0:3 on growth of psychotrophic microorganisms in associative culture at 4 degrees C, although it was later inhibited by these organisms as they reached the stationary phase, thus proving itself to be a poor competitor with common spoilage microorganism.
TI  - Inactivation of bacteria by Purogene.
AB  - The bacteriocidal efficacy of Purogene, a stabilized aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) was examined using bacteria of concern to public health. The organisms tested were: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia enterocolitica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes Group A, Salmonella typhimurium and Bacillus subtilis. The test organisms responded differently to inactivation by Purogene. At least a 4 log reduction in bacterial counts was noted when Purogene was applied at a concentration of 0.75 mg/l. Since Purogene is a stabilized complex, it was necessary to provide a chemical environment suitable for the release of ClO2 in this solution. This was done by varying the pH of Purogene from 3.5 to 8.6 (pH of Purogene is 8.6) while keeping the pH of the experimental medium constant (pH 7.0). The results showed that Purogene was most efficacious at the lowest pH tested (pH 3.5). This indicates that as chlorine dioxide solutions were reduced to chlorite (which predominates at pH 8.6), their bacteriocidal efficacy was reduced, suggesting free chlorine dioxide as the active disinfecting species.
TI  - Crossed immuno-electrophoretic analysis of Yersinia enterocolitica serotype 0:3 antigens.
AB  - By means of quantitative immuno-electrophoretic methods, 81 different antigens were demonstrated in sonicated preparations of Yersinia enterocolitica, serogroup 0:3, using corresponding rabbit antiserum. Only chromosomally-encoded antigens were demonstrated in this system. Thirteen antigens were located on the bacterial surface, as demonstrated after absorption of rabbit antiserum with whole, killed bacteria. Five antigens resisted boiling. Antigen No. 71 was identified as an important part of the lipopolysaccharide, and antigen No. 6 as the "common antigen" of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Binding activities to concanavalin A (indicating the presence of carbohydrates), to Limulus amoebocyte lysate and to polymyxin B (indicating the presence of possible endotoxin activity) were demonstrated for five, nine, and seven antigens, respectively. These observations, together with the presence of corresponding antibodies in pre-immune rabbit sera, as well as cross-reactivity with other Gram-negative bacteria, indicate the biological importance of several of these antigens.
TI  - Tigemonam, an oral monobactam.
AB  - Tigemonam is an orally administered monobactam. At less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml it inhibited the majority of strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus spp., Providencia spp., Aeromonas hydrophila, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Serratia marcescens, and Yersinia enterocolitica. At less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml it inhibited Haemophilus spp., Neisseria spp., and Branhamella catarrhalis. It did not inhibit Pseudomonas spp. or Acinetobacter spp. Tigemonam was more active than cephalexin and amoxicillin-clavulanate and inhibited many members of the family Enterobacteriaceae resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and gentamicin. Some Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii strains resistant to aminothiazole iminomethoxy cephalosporins and aztreonam were resistant to tigemonam. The MIC for 90% of hemolytic streptococci of groups A, B, and C and for Streptococcus pneumoniae was 16 micrograms/ml, but the MIC for 90% of enterococci, Listeria spp., Bacteroides spp., and viridans group streptococci was greater than 64 micrograms/ml. Tigemonam was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases such as TEM-1 and SHV-1 or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Enterobacter, Morganella, Pseudomonas, and Bacteroides spp. Tigemonam inhibited beta-lactamases of E. cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa but did not induce beta-lactamases. The growth medium had a minimal effect on the in vitro activity of tigemonam, and there was a close agreement between the MICs and MBCs.
TI  - The effect of synthetic iron chelators on bacterial growth in human serum.
AB  - The effect of synthetic iron chelators of the 1-alkyl-3-hydroxy-2-methylpyrid-4-one class (the L1 series) and 1-hydroxypyrid-2-one (L4) on bacterial growth in human serum was compared with those of the plant iron chelators mimosine and maltol and of the microbial siderophore desferrioxamine. None of the synthetic chelators enhanced growth of 3 Gram-negative organisms (Yersinia enterocolitica, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa); in some cases they were even inhibitory. L4 strongly stimulated growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis, but the L1 series had only a marginal effect. Maltol was mildly inhibitory to all 4 bacterial species, while mimosine enhanced the growth of S. epidermidis and Y. enterocolitica but had little effect on E. coli or P. aeruginosa. Desferrioxamine enhanced the growth of all except E. coli. These results suggest that the chelators of synthetic or plant origin may carry less risk of increasing susceptibility to bacterial infection in patients undergoing chelation therapy for iron overload than does desferrioxamine, the drug currently in clinical use.
TI  - Two-hour miniaturized system for detection of enteropathogenic bacteria in stool  cultures.
AB  - A miniaturized 2-h system for detection of lactose-negative potentially enteropathogenic bacteria on the basis of nine enzymatic tests was evaluated. The system was challenged with 210 strains of lactose-negative and lactose-positive species grown on MacConkey agar. Specific and constant patterns were found for Salmonella, Shigella A-C, Yersinia enterocolitica, Aeromonas spp. and Vibrio cholerae. Shigella sonnei and Hafnia alvei had an identical pattern, likewise Plesiomonas shigelloides, halophilic vibrios and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new monobactam, B0-1165.
AB  - B0-1165 is a 1-carboxy-1-cyclopropoxyamino,4-fluoromethyl monobactam. It inhibited the majority of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Aeromonas hydrophila, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Yersinia enterocolitica, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Salmonella and Shigella species at less than or equal to 0.125 microgram/ml. Overall, its in vitro activity was similar to that of aztreonam, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime, with minor differences in the MICs for individual isolates. Enterobacter species and Citrobacter freundii which were derepressed for beta-lactamase production and had higher MICs of aztreonam and ceftazidime had MICs that ranged from 4 to 32 micrograms/ml. B0-1165 had activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa similar to that of aztreonam but lower than that of ceftazidime and carumonam. Pseudomonas maltophilia and other Pseudomonas species were resistant or had MICs of 32 micrograms/ml, as did Acinetobacter species. B0-1165 did not inhibit streptococcal, staphylococcal, or anaerobic species, such as Clostridium and Bacteroides species. B0-1165 was not hydrolyzed to any appreciable extent by common plasmid- and chromosomally Richmond-Sykes type 1a-, 1c-, and 1d-mediated beta-lactamases. It inhibited the Enterobacter cloacae P99 and inducible Pseudomonas aeruginosa beta-lactamases. B0-1165 was a poor inducer of beta-lactamase, but exposing E. cloacae and C. freundii to B0-1165 selected for resistant isolates. Overall, B0-1165 had in vitro properties similar to those of other monobactams currently available or under investigation.
TI  - Early-onset Pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis and Yersinia enterocolitica neonatal infection: a unique combination in a preterm infant.
AB  - The purpose of this communication is to report the occurrence of early-onset Pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis and Yersinia enterocolitica neonatal infection. This case serves as a reminder of the changing spectrum of neonatal septicaemia.
TI  - [Measuring chemiluminescence in phagocytic granulocytes--simultaneously a parameter of their killing function?].
AB  - The results of the chemiluminescence activity determined in whole blood samples very often were used to compare the unspecific defense mechanism of polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMN) against causative organisms to preoperative capable risk parameters in surgery. Our investigations try to compare the results of a bacteria-induced chemiluminescence with those we received from a standardized agar killing plate-test. It could be shown that there is no correlation between the used two test systems. Therefore it is not possible to conclude from the chemiluminescence results especially made out of whole blood samples to the potency of the defense mechanism of PMN granulocytes.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 23-6240, a new fluorinated 4-quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Ro 23-6240 (AM833), 6,8-difluoro-1-(2-fluoroethyl)-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7(4-methyl-1-piper azinyl) quinolone-3-carboxylic acid, was compared with those of norfloxacin, enoxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. Ro 23-6240 inhibited the majority of Enterobacteriaceae isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml. It was especially active against Shigella sp., Salmonella sp., Escherichia coli, and Yersinia enterocolitica, with an MIC for 90% of the strains of less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml. The MIC for 90% of the strains was 1 microgram/ml for Serratia marcescens and 8 micrograms/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Staphylococcus aureus isolates, including methicillin-resistant strains, were inhibited by less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. Streptococcal and anaerobic species were inhibited by 8 to 16 micrograms/ml. Ro 23-6240 inhibited beta-lactamase-producing bacteria resistant to broad-spectrum cephalosporins. The overall activity of Ro 23-6240 was similar to those of enoxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin, but less than that of ciprofloxacin. The frequency of spontaneous resistance was low, although resistant bacteria could be isolated by repeated subculture. The activity of Ro 23-6240 was decreased in the presence of magnesium at concentrations similar to those present in urine.
TI  - Lipopolysaccharide structures in Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and  Vibrio cholerae are immunologically related to Campylobacter spp.
AB  - To determine whether lipopolysaccharide (LPS) structures of Campylobacter species are immunologically related to those of 11 other gram-negative organisms, we immunoblotted from polyacrylamide gels the LPS of these strains with immune rabbit serum raised against six Campylobacter jejuni strains and two Campylobacter fetus strains. The LPS studied were from Salmonella minnesota wild type and Ra to Re mutants, Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio cholerae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. None of the 11 LPS preparations was recognized by the eight antisera, but antisera to each of the Campylobacter strains recognized core determinants of some LPS preparations. Antiserum directed against the most serum-sensitive C. jejuni strain, 79-193, was the only antiserum sample that recognized core regions of the rough Salmonella mutants. In converse experiments, when LPS preparations from five Campylobacter strains were blotted with antiserum to Salmonella lipid A, recognition of core structures of each was shown; data from an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay confirmed this result. In contrast, antiserum to Salmonella typhimurium Re LPS showed no reactivity. We conclude that LPS of Campylobacter strains share lipid A antigenic determinants with the core region of LPS of several other gram-negative organisms.
TI  - In-vitro activity of ofloxacin, a quinolone carboxylic acid compared to other quinolones and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Ofloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound. Its activity against 900 bacterial isolates was determined. It inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Aeromonas hydrophila, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Yersinia enterocolitica at less than or equal to 0.8 mg/l. Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus sp., Neisseria sp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas species were inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 mg/l. Although most staphylococcal species, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci were inhibited by 3.1 mg/l, many streptococcal species had higher MIC values, and most Bacteroides species were inhibited at less than or equal to 6.3 mg/l. The overall activity of ofloxacin was similar to enoxacin and norfloxacin. Ofloxacin inhibited organisms resistant to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, cephalexin, piperacillin, and gentamicin including Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime. The activity of ofloxacin was lower at an acid pH and in urine, but serum had no effect on MICs or MBCs. Increase in ofloxacin MICs for various bacteria could be achieved by repeated subculture in the presence of ofloxacin.
TI  - [Demonstration of a species specific determinant of Bacteroides fragilis lipopolysaccharides using monoclonal antibodies].
AB  - The reactivity of two monoclonal antibodies to Bacteroides fragilis was tested (ELISA) with 37 strains of B. fragilis, 1 strain each of B. thetaiotaomicron, B. ovatus, B. vulgatus and B. eggerthii, 1 strain of Fusobacterium, as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6 strains), E coli (8 strains), Klebsiella (2 strains), Yersinia enterocolitica (1 strain) and LPS from Salmonella minnesota. Both monoclonal antibodies proved to be specific for B. fragilis. The determinants recognized by these antibodies are localized in the LPS of this gram-negative anaerobe.
TI  - Evaluation of a two-hour method for screening pathogens from stool specimens.
AB  - The 2-h stool-screening test (SST) (API System S.A., Montalieu-Vercieu, France) was used to screen 231 organisms yielding suspicious colonies on stool differential agars for potential pathogens. All 54 salmonellae yielded correct screens. Of 14 shigellas, 9 keyed as possible Shigella spp.-Yersinia enterocolitica-rare Salmonella spp. (SYS), and 5 (all Shigella sonnei) keyed as possible S. sonnei-Y. enterocolitica-Arizona spp. (SYA). Three Arizona strains were identified as probable Salmonella spp., two were identified as SYA, and one was identified as SYS. Seven Y. enterocolitica strains keyed as SYS, and two keyed as SYA; one strain was screened out as a nonpathogen. The two Aeromonas hydrophila strains keyed as SYA, and the two Plesiomonas shigelloides strains keyed as SYS. All 63 Proteus, Morganella, Providencia, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were screened out as nonpathogens. Among 80 coliforms, 37 were screened as SYA, 32 were screened as SYS, and 11 were screened as nonpathogens. On the basis of the SST, 69/80 coliforms would have been tested further. However, only 1/88 potential pathogens would have been missed, and all Proteus, Morganella, Providencia, and P. aeruginosa strains would have been excluded. The capability of the SST (when combined with a rapid identification method) of providing same-day identification of potential stool pathogens must be weighed against its inability to effectively screen out coliforms. The cost of this method is equivalent to that of a three-tube conventional screening method. The suitability of the SST for individual laboratories must be predicated on the incidence of stool pathogens and commensals in the specific setting as well as on factors related to work flow, technologist acceptability, and turnaround time.
TI  - HLA-B27 and the immune response to enterobacterial antigens in ankylosing spondylitis.
AB  - Total serum immunoglobulins and class specific serum antibodies to Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were measured in 107 patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and 110 healthy tissue typed controls by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The specificity of this technique was confirmed by the use of specific bacterial murine antisera and by cross-absorption of human sera by specific bacteria. Total serum IgA in AS patients correlated with both erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (P less than 0.001) and C-reactive protein (P less than 0.05) and was significantly elevated compared to healthy individuals (P less than 0.001). A significant elevation of IgA antibodies to K. pneumoniae was detected in the serum of AS patients with active disease when compared to healthy controls (P less than 0.01). These studies support the involvement of an enterobacterial micro-organism in the pathogenesis of AS and further relate to the role of HLA-B27 in this disease.
TI  - [In vitro bacteriostatic activity of cefmenoxime (SCE 1365), cefotaxime and moxalactam].
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (SCE 1365), a new cephalosporin derivate was compared with two other "third generation" cephalosporins: cefotaxime and moxalactam. Cefmenoxime as cefotaxime and moxalactam were very active against 305 cephalosporinase-producing and cephalosporinase-non-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Cefmenoxime was the most active against Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Morganella morganii, Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia enterocolitica with a mean MIC at least twice lower. Several strains of the species Hafnia alvei, Providencia stuartii and Proteus vulgaris were more resistant. Against Haemophilus influenzae, the activity of the three cephalosporins was higher with a mean MIC between 0,030 and 0,040 microgram/ml. Against carbenicillin-sensible or carpenicillin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, the three cephalosporins were not performant. Against Staphylococcus aureus, cefmenoxime and cefotaxime had an identical activity with a mean MIC of 1,5 microgram/ml against methicillin-sensible strains and a mean MIC of 5,5 micrograms/ml against methicillin-resistant strains.
TI  - Comparative activity of cefotaxime and selected beta-lactam antibiotics against Haemophilus influenzae and aerobic gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - The activity of cefotaxime was compared with that of ampicillin, moxalactam, and  cefoperozone against 50 isolates of Haemophilus influenzae and with that of ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefamandole, cefazolin, and several other established and investigational beta-lactam antibiotics against several hundred isolates of gram-negative aerobic enteric bacilli. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of the drugs were determined by the agar plate dilution technique for H. influenzae and by the microtiter broth dilution technique for the other pathogens. Cefotaxime was the most active agent against H. influenzae; it was 20 times more active than ampicillin. It was also the most active agent against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, nontyphoid Salmonella species, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Cefotaxime was among the most active agents against Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter species, Shigella species, Proteus mirabilis, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. None of the new cephalosporins or penicillin inhibited greater than 90% of the isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at concentrations of less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml; these drugs were, however, more active than carbenicillin.
TI  - Rapid isolation of Yersinia spp. from feces.
AB  - Direct plating or cold enrichment or both have been used to isolate Yersinia spp. from feces. Freeze-shock double enrichment and KOH treatment have been recommended for recovery of Yersinia enterocolitica from surface waters and food, respectively. These techniques were evaluated as alternatives for rapid recovery of Yersinia spp. from feces. Stool samples were homogenized in buffered saline and autoclaved. Escherichia coli. Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were each added to the suspension at a final concentration of 1.5 x 10(6) colony-forming units per ml. Yersinia cells were then added to a final concentration of 1.5 x 10(3), 1.5 x 10(4), 1.5 x 10(5), or 1.5 x 10(6) colony-forming units per ml. A total of 21 strains of Y. enterocolitica, 2 of Yersinia kristensenii, and 1 each of Yersinia intermedia and Yersinia fredriksenii were tested. For freeze-shock double enrichment, seeded stool samples were frozen overnight (-70 degrees C), transferred successively to m-tetrathionate broth (6 h. 37 degrees C) and selenite broth (2 h 37 degrees C), and plated on MacConkey, salmonella-shigella, and cellobiose-arginine-lysine agars for quantitation. For KOH treatment, seeded stool samples were mixed with 0.5% KOH at a ratio of 1:2 for 2 min and plated as described above. E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa were virtually eliminated after either method was used. All Yersinia strains were recovered after KOH treatment even at the lowest initial concentration (1.5 x 10(3) colony-forming units per ml). However, after freeze-shock double enrichment, not all strains were retrievable, and those isolates which were recovered were grown only from samples containing the highest number of Yersinia strains (1.5 x 10(6) colony-forming units per ml). KOH treatment of stool samples seems to be a viable substitute for more protracted methods of recovering Yersinia spp.
TI  - Synthesis of a selective agar medium for Yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  - A new agar medium for isolation of Yersinia enterocolitica was formulated based on growth studies which defined an optimum basal, and the evaluation of selective chemical agents, dyes, and antibiotics. The final formulation, designated cefsulodin-irgasan-novobiocin(CIN) agar, provided quantitative recovery of 40 different strains of Y. enterocolitica in 24 h using incubation at 32 degrees C or with 48 h of incubation at 22 degrees C. The medium was highly selective, especially against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. Colony morphology coupled with a differential reaction resulting from mannitol fermentation permitted discrimination of Y. enterocolitica from most of those Gram-negative bacteria that were able to grow on the medium. Recovery and selective characteristics of CIN agar were stable during storage at room temperature for 9 days. CIN agar gave a higher recovery of Y. enterocolitica from feces both direct and with cold enrichment (0.4/1.5%) than Salmonella-Shigella (0.0/0.7%) and MacConkey (0.0/0.9%) agars while significantly reducing the level of background organisms.
TI  - Effect of dyes on the quantitative recovery of Yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  - A total of 69 dyes were incorporated separately at different concentrations into  an agar medium for evaluation of their effects on the quantitative recovery of five serotypes of Yersinia enterocolitica. One strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and one strain of Bacillus cereus were included for comparative purposes. Certain dyes were evaluated further for their selective properties with five additional serotypes of Y. enterocolitica, three strains of P. aeruginosa, and two of Engerobacter spp. Metanil yellow was the only dye which was tolerated bettr by Y. enterocolitica than by P. aeruginosa. Dye sensitivity was variable amond strains of the same serotype of Y. enterocolitica. In general, Y. enterocolitica showed a tolerance to dyes greater than that of gram-positive bacteria and similar to that of other gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Relative importance of enterotoxigenic and invasive enteropathogenic bacteria in  infantile diarrhoea.
AB  - Swedish children and adults (648 patients) with acute diarrhoea were investigated for enterotoxigenic strains in stool cultures. A total number 74 strains were isolated from 28 patients and assayed in the rabbit intestinal loop test and the adrenal cell test. Only three of the enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) isolates belonged to classical enteropathogenic serotypes of E. coli (EPEC). Two enterotoxigenic strains of Proteus morganii, two of Enterobacter hafniae and one of Citrobacter freundii were isolated. None of 67 EPEC strains were found to produce a heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) in either of the two test systems. A number of Yersinia enterocolitica and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains from stool cultures often produced toxic effects in the cell test but no enterotoxin activity was detected for any of the strains investigated either in the adrenal cell test for heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) or the suckling mouse test for heat-stable enterotoxin (ST). All EPEC isolates were also tested for ST and for invasive properties in the Sereny test; each isolate was negative in both test systems. It is concluded that production of LT and ST enterotoxin were common in stool isolates from Ethiopian children but a rare phenomenon among Swedish children with acute infantile diarrhoea. Isolation of aerobic stool bacteria with invasive properties seems to be uncommon both in Ethiopian and Swedish children. However, since both LT and ST as well as invasive properties seem to be very unstable genetic properties in many of these stool isolates improved sensitive methods for the last two properties will probably change this picture in the future.
TI  - Absolute configuration of 3-hydroxy fatty acids present in lipopolysaccharides from various bacterial groups.
AB  - The absolute configuration of 3-hydroxy fatty acids has been studied, which are present in the lipopolysaccharides of the following bacteria: Phodopseudomonas gelatinosa, Rh. viridis, Rhodospirillum tenue, Chromobacterium violaceum, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bordetella pertussis, Vibrio metchnikovii, Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis, Yersinia enterocolitica and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The 3-hydroxy acids were liberated by strong alkaline hydrolysis, converted to 3-methoxy acid L-phenylethylamides and analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. With the aid of authentic D-3-hydroxy fatty acids it was shown for all lipopolysaccharides that the 3-hydroxy acids, regardless of chain lengths, branching, 3-O-substitution or type of linkage, possess the D-configuration. 2-Hydroxydodecanoic acid, which is present in some lipopolysaccharides, was analyzed in an analogous way and shown to possess the L-configuration.
TI  - Common enterobacterial antigen in Yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  - Production of the common enterobacterial antigen (CA) by strains of Yersinia enterocolitica (Y.e.) serotypes 3 and 9 (Winblad), by strains of 5 different Y.e. serogroups (Wauters) and various other bacteria was examined. Antibody against CA was raised by immunization of rabbits with E. coli O 14. Extract prepared from S. typhimurium was used for the sensitization of sheep erythrocytes with CA. Absorption and haemagglutination inhibition experiments showed that CA could be detected in heat extracts from all Y.e. strains examined, and in that from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. CA was not detected in extracts from Pasteurella multocida, Francisella tularensis, Brucella abortus, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Anti-CA antibodies could not be demonstrated in serum from rabbits immunized with Y.e. bacteria, but were demonstrated in serum from rabbits immunized with a CA-containing fraction of the Y.e. extract. The possibility of participation of anti-CA antibody in indirect haemagglutination tests for detection of antibody to Y.e. O antigens is emphasized.
TI  - Properties of R factors from Bordetella bronchiseptica.
AB  - Genetic properties and host ranges of R factors derived from Bordetella bronchiseptica of pig origin were examined. All of 61 R factors tested could confer resistance to streptomycin, sulfonamide, and aminobenzyl penicillin on their host bacteria. All of them were identified as fi(-) (no fertility inhibition) type and were found to exhibit no restriction of phages lambda, phi80, P1, P2, T1, T3, T6, T7, W31, and BF-23. They could confer macarbomysin susceptibility on their host cells when infected. An Rte16, a representative R factor, was incompatible with both RP4 and R40a, which are classified as compatibility groups P and C, respectively. An Rte16 was conjugally transmissible to B. bronchiseptica, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Salmonella typhimurium, and Yersinia enterocolitica, but not to Shigella flexneri, S. sonnei, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, P. rettgeri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
