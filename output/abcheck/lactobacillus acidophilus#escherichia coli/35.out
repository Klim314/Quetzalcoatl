evaluation of bean and soy tempeh influence on intestinal bacteria and estimation of antibacterial properties of bean tempeh.
in this study the effect of bean tempeh on the growth of bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus paracasei bacteria was investigated.
antibacterial activity was observed only in relation to the bacteria bacillus subtilis.
the effect of tempeh products on human intestinal microflora was also assessed.
bean and soy tempeh were culinarily processed and next digested in conditions simulating the human digestive tract (one of the digestive tracts was equipped with a mechanism simulating absorption).
soy tempeh stimulated most the growth of bacteria of the genus bifidobacterium, while bean tempeh that of escherichia coli.
using simulation of absorption for the digestion of fried soy tempeh resulted in a higher rise in the bacteria count of the genus lactobacillus, while after digestion of fried bean tempeh the highest increase was recorded for bifidobacterium and e. coli.
