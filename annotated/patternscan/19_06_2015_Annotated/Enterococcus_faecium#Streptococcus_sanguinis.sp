TI  == in vitro activity of linezolid as assessed through the 2013 leader surveillance program.
AB  == the 2013 leader surveillance program monitored the in vitro activity of linezolid and comparator agents against gram-positive bacteria at 60 medical centers in the united states. a total of 7183 pathogens were contributed from 6 predetermined pathogen groups. the groups were staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans group streptococci. the mic90 value for each of the 6  pathogen groups was 1 mug/ml. susceptibility of "all organisms" to linezolid was  99.83%. only 12 isolates (2 s. aureus, 3 staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 streptococcus sanguinis, 5 enterococcus faecium, and 1 enterococcus faecalis) were nonsusceptible to linezolid (0.17%). three of these (2 s. aureus and 1 e. faecium) harbored the cfr resistance mechanism. the findings indicate that linezolid activity remains stable, although there are examples of clonal dissemination within several monitored institutions.

TI  == microbial diversity in persistent root canal infections investigated by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == introduction: the aim of the present study was to investigate the composition of  the root canal microbiota in endodontic failures in order to identify and quantify these microorganisms. methods: microbiological samples were taken from 36 root canals with persistent endodontic infection. the presence, levels, and proportions of 79 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the pearson correlation coefficient was used to investigate the relations between bacterial counts and clinical conditions (p </= .05). results:  enterococcus faecium (36%), streptococcus epidermidis (36%), eubacterium saburreum (28%), parvimonas micra (28%), streptococcus sanguis (28%), capnocytophaga sputigena (28%), leptotrichia buccalis (28%), enterococcus faecalis (28%), and staphylococcus warneri (28%) were the most prevalent species; and there was a low prevalence of treponema socranskii (3%), fusobacterium periodonticum (3%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (3%), and spiroplasma ixodetis (3%). the highest mean levels were found for the following species: e. faecium, dialister pneumosintes, staphylococcus epidermidis and helicobacter pylori. there was a statistically significant difference between the levels of gram-negative species and gram-positive species (13.5 x 10(5) vs 6.5 x 10(5), respectively). a  positive correlation was found between the area of the periapical lesion and the  levels of gram-negative and rod species (p < .05). conclusions: the microbiota from teeth with persistent apical periodontitis presents a mixed and complex profile, hosting e. faecium and s. epidermidis as the most highly prevalent species. no correlation was found between any of the species tested and clinical  findings; however, periapical lesions with the largest areas presented higher counts of gram-negative and rod species.

TI  == evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  versatrek blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere, northbrook, il) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. a total of 148 versatrek redox 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating gram-positive bacteria were tested. results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identifications. we obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (24), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (14), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (17), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus parasanguinis (2), streptococcus sanguinis (1), streptococcus cristatus (1), the streptococcus bovis group (5), streptococcus agalactiae (9), the streptococcus anginosus group (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre fcm) (16), vancomycin-susceptible  enterococcus faecalis (3), aerococcus viridans (2), bacillus (6), corynebacterium (8), lactobacillus (2), micrococcus (2), neisseria mucosa (1), escherichia coli (3), candida tropicalis (1), propionibacterium (1), and rothia (1). overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. a total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. we tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. a chart review of 31 patients with mrsa, mssa, or vre demonstrated that the nanosphere bc-gp assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with mrsa or vre. the bc-gp assay may have a positive impact on patient  care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.

TI  == streptococcus
AB  == the genus streptococcus , a heterogeneous group of gram-positive bacteria, has broad significance in medicine and industry. various streptococci are important ecologically as part of the normal microbial flora of animals and humans; some can also cause diseases that range from subacute to acute or even chronic. among  the significant human diseases attributable to streptococci are scarlet fever, rheumatic heart disease, glomerulonephritis, and pneumococcal pneumonia. streptococci are essential in industrial and dairy processes and as indicators of pollution. the nomenclature for streptococci, especially the nomenclature in medical use, has been based largely on serogroup identification of cell wall components rather than on species names. for several decades, interest has focused on two major species that cause severe infections: s pyogenes (group a streptococci) and s pneumoniae (pneumococci). in 1984, two members were assigned  a new genus - the group d enterococcal species (which account for 98% of human enterococcal infections) became enterococcus faecalis (the majority of human clinical isolates) and e faecium (associated with a remarkable capacity for antibiotic resistance). in recent years, increasing attention has been given to other streptococcal species, partly because innovations in serogrouping methods have led to advances in understanding the pathogenetic and epidemiologic significance of these species. a variety of cell-associated and extracellular products are produced by streptococci, but their cause-effect relationship with pathogenesis has not been defined. some of the other medically important streptococci are s agalactiae (group b), an etiologic agent of neonatal disease;  e faecalis (group d), a major cause of endocarditis, and the viridans streptococci. particularly for the viridans streptococci, taxonomy and nomenclature are not yet fully reliable or consistent. important members of the viridans streptococci, normal commensals, include s mutans and s sanguis (involved in dental caries), s mitis (associated with bacteremia, meningitis, periodontal disease and pneumonia), and "s milleri" (associated with suppurative  infections in children and adults). there remains persistent taxonomic confusion  regarding "s milleri." these and other streptococci of medical importance are listed intable 13-1by serogroup designation, normal ecologic niche, and associated disease.

TI  == inhibiting effects of enterococcus faecium non-biofilm strain on streptococcus mutans biofilm formation.
AB  == background and purpose: enterococcus faecium is a normal bowel commensal and lactic acid bacterium that is rarely found in the oral cavity. this study investigated whether a non-pathogenic and non-biofilm strain of e. faecium functioned as a probiotic strain toward biofilm formation by streptococcus mutans, which is an etiological agent for dental caries. methods: the effects of  e. faecium on streptococcal biofilm was evaluated by absorbance of safranin-stained biofilm at 492 nm in a 96-well microtiter plate. results: the e. faecium strain demonstrated cell-number-dependent inhibition of biofilm in dual cultures with 4 laboratory and 16 clinical s. mutans strains, as well as laboratory strains of streptococcus sobrinus and streptococcus sanguinis, in 96-well microtiter plates. the inhibiting effects of e. faecium were not dependent on the production of bacteriocin from streptococci and e. faecium, low  ph after mix culture, or biofilm formation levels of s. mutans. a culture supernatant sample of more than 10 kda from e. faecium showed direct inhibiting effects toward s. mutans biofilm formation. treatment of heat, butanol, and phenol to a supernatant sample restored biofilm formation in culture of s. mutans with the sample. moreover, the tendencies of inhibition levels by the supernatant sample were associated with those by bacterial cells of e. faecium to s. mutans strains. conclusions: the e. faecium non-biofilm strain produced an inhibiting protein to streptococci biofilm formation, showed various susceptibilities to inhibit streptococcal biofilm, and acted as a probiotic bacterial inhibitor of streptococcal biofilm formation.

TI  == decontamination effects of low-temperature plasma generated by corona discharge.  part ii: new insights.
AB  == the second part of our paper presents the results of experiments with the decontamination of surfaces by low-temperature plasma generated by corona discharge in air at atmospheric pressure. a simple device is described and the effects of the corona discharge on model microorganisms, viz. the yeast candida albicans, gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, neisseria sicca, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, gram-positive bacteria deinococcus radiodurans, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus sanguinis, and vegetative and spore forms of geobacillus stearothermophilus are discussed. a similar microbicidal effect after about one-minute exposure was observed in all vegetative forms of the microorganisms. measurement in growth inhibition zones on a semisolid medium was used to determine the dependence of the microbicidal effect on exposure time and the distance between electrodes. counting of colonies served to assess the microbicidal effect of the discharge on contaminated inert surfaces observable after more than 1 min exposure. geobacillus stearothermophilus spores were found to have several times lower susceptibility to the action of the discharge and the microbicidal effect was observed only after an 8 min exposure. reaction with the iodide reagent did not unambiguously demonstrate the difference between ozone and singlet oxygen as presumed active components of the corona. the area distribution of reactive oxygen species was determined; it was found to differ from the wartburg law depending on exposure time. qualitative evidence was obtained on the penetration  of the reactive oxygen species into the semisolid medium.

TI  == use of the phoenix automated system for identification of streptococcus and enterococcus spp.
AB  == the phoenix system (becton dickinson diagnostic systems, sparks, md) was evaluated for identification (id) to the species level of streptococci and enterococci. two hundred clinical isolates were investigated: beta-hemolytic streptococci (n = 50), streptococcus pneumoniae organisms (n = 46), viridans group streptococci (n = 31), enterococcus faecium (n = 36), enterococcus faecalis (n = 25), and other catalase-negative cocci (n = 12). the api system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) was used as a comparator. molecular methods (sequencing of 16s rrna and zwf and gki genes and ddl gene amplification) were used to investigate discordant results. upon resolution of discrepancies, correct species id was achieved by the phoenix system for 121/129 (93.8%) streptococci and 63/70  (90.0%) enterococci. excellent results were obtained for s. pneumoniae (45/45) and beta-hemolytic streptococci (49/50). with regard to viridans streptococci, the accuracy of the phoenix system was 83.9%. among the latter organisms, the best performance was obtained with isolates of the streptococcus sanguinis group  and streptococcus anginosus group; problems were instead encountered with the streptococcus mitis group. four e. faecium and three e. faecalis isolates were misidentified as enterococcus casseliflavus/enterococcus gallinarum or enterococcus durans. thus, these isolates were identified only at the genus level. compared with commercially available systems, the phoenix system appears a reliable diagnostic tool for identifying clinically relevant streptococci and enterococci. the smic/id-2 panel proved particularly effective for beta-hemolytic streptococci and pneumococci.

TI  == binding of porcine ficolin-alpha to lipopolysaccharides from gram-negative bacteria and lipoteichoic acids from gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == protein(s) reactive with n-acetyl-d-glucosamine (glcnac) was isolated from porcine nonimmune serum. the molecular weight of the purified protein was found to be mainly 40 kda on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  under reducing conditions. the n-terminal 10 amino acid sequence of the purified  protein were found to be identical to that of porcine ficolin-alpha reported previously. in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the purified protein was found  to react with lipopolysaccharides (lps) from different gram-negative bacteria such as esherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, salmonella abortus equi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, shigella flexeneri, and serratia marcescens and with lipoteichoic acid (lta) from gram-positive bacteria such as streptococcus sanguis, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus. the purified protein also reacted with e. coli o26 isolated from food poisoning and bovine feces and heat-treated gram-positive bacteria such as s. aureus, b. cereus, b. subtilis, enterococcus faecium, and corynebacterum bovis. on the other hand, porcine igg isolated from nonimmune serum showed different reactivity with these lps, lta, and heat-treated bacterial cells. from the present findings, purified porcine serum protein reactive with glcnac is concluded to be ficolin-alpha playing an important role(s) in innate immunity against microbial infection with gram-positive and -negative bacteria.

TI  == [therapeutic impact of streptococcal and enterococcal bacteremia in hematology patients].
AB  == from january 1999 to may 2000 (17 months), 21 strains of streptococci and four strains of enterococci have been isolated from 74 blood cultures in 25 infectious episodes in hematologic patients. they concerned 21 patients, of 21 to 77 years old. these patients suffered from acute leukaemia (14 cases), chronic lymphoid leukaemia (two cases), non-hodgkin's lymphoma (two cases) or myeloma (three cases). seventeen patients displayed a single streptococcal or enterococcal episode, two had two episodes in the course of a single stay in the hospital, two others in the course of two different stays. during 16 episodes (64%), the bacteremia occurred within 15 days after the onset of neutropenia consecutive to  antimitotic chemotherapy, and in nine episodes (36%) it has occurred after a period exceeding 15 days. in six cases the patients had already received antibiotics with a large antibacterial activity (beta-lactam, fluoroquinolone and/or glycopeptide +/- aminoside) and in four cases a single antibiotic (synergistine or cotrimoxazole). most streptococci (20/21) were oral streptococci (ten streptococcus mitis, five s. oralis, two s. sanguis, three s. pneumoniae). a single strain of beta-hemolytic streptococci has been identified as s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. the enterococci were one strain of enterococcus  faecalis and three e. faecium. ten streptococci were susceptible to 0.25 mg/l of  penicillin g, ten were less susceptible (0.5 < or = mic < 32 mg/l), and a strain  was resistant (mic = 32 mg/l). eighteen strains were susceptible to amoxicillin and cefotaxime. for three strains, the mics of amoxicillin and cefotaxime (8-16 mg/l and 8-32 mg/l, respectively) were higher. levels of resistance of the enterococci to the beta-lactam (penicillin, amoxicillin, and piperacillin) were variable. all species were susceptible to glycopeptides. three patients were transferred in intensive care unit for respiratory distress or shock syndrome. their evolution has remained severe under antibiotherapy comprising beta-lactam or vancomycin associated with an aminoside. this results demonstrate the interest of species identification to adapt the antibiotic treatment and confirms the frequency of oral streptococci in severe bacteremia in neutropenic patients.

TI  == in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against selected bacterial pathogens isolated in italy.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin, against 732 clinical strains recently isolated in italy. methods: susceptibility tests were performed according to nccls-guided mic methodology. pathogens included in the evaluation included 108 staphylococcus aureus isolates, 124 coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates, 158 streptococcus pyogenes isolates, 30 streptococcus agalactiae isolates, 30 b-hemolytic streptococcal isolates, 18 streptococcus sanguis isolates, 80 streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 69 enterococcal isolates, 40 haemophilus influenzae isolates, 30 moraxella catarrhalis isolates and, finally, 30 gram-positive and 25 gram-negative anaerobes. results: quinupristin/dalfopristin  inhibited staphylococcus aureus and other staphylococcus spp., irrespective of their oxacillin or erythromycin resistance phenotypes. similarly, streptococci were fully inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin. enterococcus faecalis was not  included in the spectrum of this streptogramin, while isolates of enterococcus faecium were inhibited by the new compound. respiratory pathogens such as h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis were inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin as well as all gram-negative anaerobes tested. conclusions: these findings suggest a putative role for quinupristin/dalfopristin in the empirical treatment of severe  nosocomial and community-acquired infections caused by pathogens often displaying resistance to multiple antibiotics. this drug may provide an alternative to glycopeptide compounds.

TI  == a protocol for polymerase chain reaction detection of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium from the root canal.
AB  == aim: the present study was set up to develop a protocol for detection of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium from the root canal. methodology:  a collection of type strains and clinical isolates ol e. faecalis and faecium was used. specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr) primers targeted against the 16s/23s rdna intergenic region were used and pcr reactions were set up. pcr products were run on tbe-agarose gel and analysed. the sensitivity of the pcr systems was studied using serial dilutions of (i) bacterial dna and (ii) bacterial cells from e. faecalis. the specificity of the identification was tested against closely related species. results: all strains of e. faecalis and e. faecium produced identical amplicon profiles composed of two major bands corresponding to sizes of 320 and 420 bp. when amplifying dna of higher purity, a third band of 600 bp became evident as well. closely related species demonstrated single bands of various sizes and were easily distinguished from enterococci. the detection level of dna from serial dilutions of dna was 10(-13) g. the dna extraction protocol from bacterial cell suspensions resulted in a detection level of 10 bacterial cells per sample. conclusions the present study demonstrated a good potential for using pcr technology in the detection of f. faecalis and e. faecium from root canal samples. with a high specificity the methodology was able to detect 10 cells of e. faecalis.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
AB  == bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to china with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. in this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. the cell growth of streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of s. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. the bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on s. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); ph, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including s. mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis, with mics ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of s. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of  ph in the broth. thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.

TI  == detection of bacteraemia in patients with fever and neutropenia using 16s rrna gene amplification by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == episodes of fever and neutropenia are common complications of treatment for cancer. the use of prophylactic and early empirical antibiotics has reduced mortality but decreases the sensitivity of diagnostic tests based on culture. the aim of this study was to determine the potential of a broad diagnostic approach (eubacterial) based on 16s rrna gene amplification and sequencing to augment cultural methods of diagnosis of bacteraemia in patients with fever and neutropenia in a regional paediatric oncology centre. one hundred eleven patient-episodes of fever and neutropenia were evaluated during the study period, 17 of which were associated with positive blood cultures, as follows: staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 6 episodes), enterococcus faecium (n = 2), streptococcus sanguis (n = 3), streptococcus mitis (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), micrococcus spp. (n = 1), and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 1). eubacterial polymerase chain reaction (pcr) detected bacterial dna in nine of 11  blood culture-positive episodes for which a sample was available for pcr; the species identified by sequence analysis were identical to those derived from the  conventional identification of the cultured isolates. bacterial dna was detected  in 20 episodes (21 bacterial sequences) associated with negative blood cultures,  18 of which occurred in patients who were receiving antibiotics at the time of sample collection. the species presumptively identified by partial 16s rrna gene  sequencing were as follows: pseudomonas spp. (n = 6 episodes), acinetobacter spp. (n =5 ); escherichia spp. (n = 3); moraxella spp. (n = 3); staphylococcus spp. (n = 2); neisseria spp. (n = 1); and bacillus spp. (n = 1). the results of this study suggest that molecular techniques can augment cultural methods in the diagnosis of bacteraemia in patients who have been treated with antibiotics.

TI  == influence of lipoteichoic acid structure on recognition by the macrophage scavenger receptor.
AB  == lipoteichoic acids (ltas) belong to the immunostimulatory class of molecules of gram-positive bacteria (gpb). previous investigations showed that the macrophage  scavenger receptor (sr), a glycosylated trimeric transmembrane protein, binds directly to many gpb, possibly via lta. sr binding to other ligands is dependent  upon the spatial characteristics of the repeating negative charge of the ligand.  we therefore investigated sr recognition of lta species with various charge densities and distributions by determining the capacity of these ltas to compete  with the binding of metabolically labeled sr to beads coated with the known sr ligand polyguanylic acid. staphylococcus aureus lta, a classical lta type (unbranched 1,3-linked polyglycerophosphate chain covalently bound to a membrane  diacylglyceroglycolipid), had a 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50) for inhibition of sr binding of 0.84 microg/ml. when the s. aureus lta was rendered more negatively charged by removal of ester-linked alanine from the polyglycerophosphate backbone, the ic50 dropped to 0.23 microg/ml. other polyglycerophosphate ltas from enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae, listeria monocytogenes, listeria welshimeri, and streptococcus sanguis showed ic50s of 0.5 to 2.1 microg/ml, supporting the role of negative charge in binding to sr. accordingly, the zwitterionic lta of streptococcus pneumoniae and clostridium innocuum lta substituted with positively charged sugar residues had no binding capacity. monoglycerophosphate branches, but not succinyl ester, affected binding of lipoglycans. the data presented above parallel the previous findings for whole organisms and support the role of surface-associated lta as a major ligand of gpb for binding to sr. whether binding of lta and whole gpb to macrophages initiates uptake and degradation or results in signal transduction remains to be determined.

TI  == gram-positive cocci isolated from slaughtered poultry.
AB  == gram-positive cocci were found in all meat samples of poultry slaughtered and processed for retail sale, at incidence rates ranging from 10(2) cfu/ml to 1.35 x 10(6) cfu/ml and a mode between 8 x 10(5) and 9 x 10(5) cfu/ml for 75% of the samples. the 93 isolated strains were identified as belonging to the following species: enterococcus faecalis (48 strains), e. faecium (16), e. avium (7), e. durans (4), aerococcus viridans (10), streptococcus morbillorum (2), s. salivarius (1), s. sanguis (1), s. "milleri" (1), s. pneumoniae (1), s. acidominimus (1), and gemella haemolysans (1). these species, which mainly colonize the intestinal tract, but may also be found in other parts of both the human and animal body, are pathogens or potentially such. their presence is an indication of the fecal contamination of meat processed following gutting of slaughtered chickens (endogenous contamination). a count of the gram-positive cocci and enterobacteria detected showed that enterococci were present in a far greater number than coliform bacteria.

TI  == endocarditis due to high level gentamicin resistant enterococcus faecium.
AB  == we describe the first reported case in the literature of bacterial endocarditis caused by enterococcus faecium that was highly resistant to gentamicin. the case  is unusual in that it followed a successfully treated streptococcus sanguis endocarditis. the micro-organism was susceptible only to the glycopeptide antibiotics, vancomycin and teicoplanin and to agents such as pristinamycin and daptomycin which are not routinely available for treatment. it illustrates the therapeutic dilemma posed by serious infections with such micro-organisms and supports previous observations that early heart valve replacement surgery may be  necessary to achieve cure of endocarditis due to enterococci which are highly resistant to gentamicin. it further emphasises the importance of screening for high-level aminoglycoside resistance in enterococci in all life threatening enterococcal infections, including endocarditis, septicaemia and meningitis when  aminoglycoside-penicillin synergy is required for successful treatment.

AB  == eighty-two episodes of bacteremia due to streptococci (including the genus enterococcus) in 78 patients hospitalized at institut jules bordet between 1986 and 1988 were reviewed. the incidence ranged from 5.5 to 7.6 per 1,000 admissions (16% of all bacteremias). enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis were the most prevalent isolates, followed by streptococcus angionosus, streptococcus salivarius, and large colony-forming beta-hemolytic species (a, b, c, and g). twenty-one episodes were polymicrobial. one-half of the patients had solid tumors, and one-half had hematologic malignancies. forty-two patients were neutropenic (less than 1,000 polymorphonuclear neutrophils/microl). only 15 episodes were acquired outside the hospital, and 11 episodes were breakthrough bacteremias. twenty patients died within 1 month of the onset of streptococcal bacteremia. five patients, two of whom were neutropenic, had fatal  adult respiratory distress syndrome. the source of bacteremia remained undetermined in 35.4% of the episodes; the oral mucous membrane and the gastrointestinal tract were the most frequently recognized associated sites of infection. no unexpected antimicrobial resistance was observed except in two penicillin-resistant strains, one s. mitis and one e. faecium. no relation between peak or trough serum bactericidal titers and outcome could be demonstrated.

TI  == a truncated tn916-like element in a clinical isolate of enterococcus faecium.
AB  == a 58.7-kb nonconjugative plasmid (pkq1) previously reported in a clinical isolate of enterococcus faecium was found to contain both a tetm and an erythromycin resistance (erm) determinant. the plasmid contained a region homologous to the a, f, h, and g hincii fragments of tn916. however, the 4.8-kb b fragment of tn916 which contained the tetm determinant was replaced by a 7.3-kb fragment, and the 3.6-kb hincii c fragment of tn916 was missing. an element homologous to tn917 was juxtaposed to the truncated tn916-like element. the tn917-like element was similar in size to the erm transposon tn917 as determined by a clai restriction digest which spanned approximately 99% of the transposon. when bacillus subtilis  or streptococcus sanguis were transformed with pkq1, no zygotically induced transposition of the tetm element was detected. similarly no transposition of the tn917-like element was detected.

TI  == [in vitro bactericidal effect of temafloxacin and tosufloxacin against streptococci].
AB  == tosufloxacin tosylate (tosu) and temafloxacin hydrochloride (tema) were tested in vitro against 248 clinical isolates of various species of streptococci recovered  in a hospital microbiology laboratory (bellevue regional teaching hospital). species included s. pneumoniae (n = 20), group a streptococci (n = 22), group b streptococci (n = 30), group g streptococci (n = 17), group d s. bovis (n = 19),  enterococcus faecium (n = 45), enterococcus faecalis (n = 28), s. sanguis (n = 21), s. milleri (n = 29) and s. mitis (n = 17). activities of each of the two study drugs were evaluated comparatively with two other fluoroquinolones, i.e., ciprofloxacin (cip) and pefloxacin (pef). activities of each of these four antibiotics, expressed as the mic 90%, varied as follows according to the species of streptococci: tosu, 0.25 to 1 mg/l, tema 0.5 to 2 mg/l, cip, 1 to 4 mg/l and pef 8 to 32 mgl. overall, tosu and tema exhibited the greatest activity of the various species. the size of the inoculum had no significant effect on mic values.

TI  == vancomycin resistance is encoded on a pheromone response plasmid in enterococcus  faecium 228.
AB  == in enterococcus faecium 228, vancomycin resistance is encoded on a 55-kilobase conjugative plasmid, phkk100. this plasmid was transferred with high frequency into susceptible strains of enterococcus faecalis and conferred responses to pheromones produced by e. faecalis and streptococcus sanguis. phkk100 is the first plasmid described that mediates both vancomycin resistance and pheromone response.

TI  == enterococcal resistance to vancomycin and related cyclic glycopeptide antibiotics.
AB  == enterococci belonging to various species resistant to vancomycin and related cyclic glycopeptide antibiotics have been isolated from hospitalized patients in  france, the uk and the usa. all such strains examined display inducible synthesis of a membrane protein associated with resistance. the mechanism by which the membrane protein acts has not been definitively established, but it may block the access of the antibiotic to its peptidoglycan target. that the protein could be a bypass enzyme has not been ruled out. transfer of glycopeptide resistance by conjugation to either enterococcus faecium or enterococcus faecalis and by transformation of streptococcus sanguis challis has been reported. the structural and regulatory genes encoding this resistance can be localized on plasmid and, apparently, chromosomal dna. the plasmids encoding this resistance appear to differ from each other and have variable host ranges, but share at least some dna sequence homology.

TI  == dna probe for identification of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == a total of 287 clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) were  tested for their ability to undergo autolysis when treated with sodium deoxycholate. the test was positive for all but one isolate, strain doc-1. this autolysis required the activity of an enzyme which is unique and characteristic of s. pneumoniae: a choline-dependent n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, the gene product of the lyta gene. we used lyta as a dna probe to test the distribution of the autolysin gene among clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae. in dot blot hybridization experiments our probe reacted with the dna of 60 of 60 strains tested, including the autolysis-deficient clinical isolate doc-1. no hybridization occurred when strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus bovis were tested. the lyta gene appears to be an ideal candidate for use as a dna probe for the identification of s. pneumoniae.

TI  == transferable vancomycin and teicoplanin resistance in enterococcus faecium.
AB  == enterococcus faecium bm4165 and bm4178, isolated from immunocompromised patients, one treated with vancomycin, were inducibly resistant to high levels of the glycopeptide antibiotics vancomycin and teicoplanin but susceptible to the new lipopeptide daptomycin (ly146032). strain bm4165 was also resistant to macrolidelincosamide-streptogramin b-type (mls) antibiotics. the genes conferring resistance to glycopeptides and to mls antibiotics in strain bm4165 were carried  on plasmids pip819 and pip821, respectively; pip819 also carried genes that encoded resistance to mls antibiotics. the two plasmids, which were distinct although related, were self-transferable to other e. faecium strains. plasmid pip819 could also conjugate to e. faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, s. pyogenes, s. lactis, and listeria monocytogenes, in which it conferred inducible glycopeptide resistance, but not to s. aureus. glycopeptide-inactivating activity was not detected, and the biochemical mechanism of resistance remains unknown. based on this first report of transferable resistance to glycopeptides, we anticipate dissemination of resistance to these antibiotics in gram-positive cocci and bacilli in which it can be phenotypically expressed.

TI  == role of immunoblotting in the diagnosis of culture negative and enterococcal endocarditis.
AB  == serum samples from patients with endocarditis and septicaemia due to enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus bovis, and streptococcus sanguis were immunoblotted against antigenic extracts from all four species. in e faecalis endocarditis there was a strong igm response to e faecalis antigenic bands of 112, 88-90, and 45-47 kd and a strong igg response to 88-90 and 45-47 kd bands. in e faecium endocarditis there was a pronounced igg response to an e faecium band of 82-90 kd. for s bovis endocarditis, there was a strong igg response to several components of s bovis including bands of 66, 58, 52 and 4 kd. for s sanguis, there was a strong igg response to bands of 80-82, 76, 60 and 45 kd. these patterns of antibody production were absent in patients with uncomplicated septicaemia and in controls. the delineation of these patterns enabled confirmation of the final diagnosis in seven patients initially suspected of having culture negative endocarditis.

TI  == cell surface hydrophobicity of group d and viridans streptococci isolated from patients with septicaemia.
AB  == sixty-three strains of group d streptococci and viridans streptococci isolated from blood cultures during a two year period were typed to the species level with conventional biochemical tests and api strep. streptococcus faecalis was the most common species isolated followed by s. sanguis, s. mitis and s. constellatus (s.  milleri). one of the two isolates of s. faecium was a contamination. the reported increasing frequency of this organism and other group d and viridans streptococci as well as the association of s. bovis with malignant bowel disease indicate the  need for full identification of streptococcal isolates from blood cultures. pronounced surface hydrophobicity as measured with the salt aggregation test (sat) was expressed by 59/63 (94%) of the blood culture isolates whereas strains  isolated from commercial fermentation products and strains passaged several times were hydrophilic. in the presence of human serum albumin which binds to lipoteichoic acid only one strain decreased in surface hydrophobicity. the surface hydrophobicity of two strains even slightly increased indicating that lipoteichoic acid but marginally contributes to surface hydrophobicity of streptococcal cells from these species.

TI  == streptococcus faecalis sex pheromone (cam373) also produced by staphylococcus aureus and identification of a conjugative transposon (tn918).
AB  == streptococcus faecalis rc73 was found to harbor a conjugative plasmid (pam373) which confers a mating response to a sex pheromone (cam373) excreted by plasmid-free members of the same species. the pheromone was also detected in culture filtrates of all of 23 staphylococcus aureus strains but in only 2 of 22  coagulase negative staphylococcus strains. streptococcus sanguis challis and g9b  also produced the activity, but 10 other streptococcus sanguis strains did not. the activity was also produced by streptococcus faecium 9790. a tetracycline resistance (tc) determinant present in s. faecalis rc73 was not associated with pam373 but served as a useful marker in efforts to identify pam373 among other plasmids present in the strain. analyses of the tc determinant showed that it was located on a conjugative transposon very similar to tn916. designated tn918, the  transposon could insert into pam373 as well as into two other hemolysin plasmids. whereas pam373 derivatives transferred very well between strains of streptococcus faecalis, the plasmid would not establish in staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus sanguis. however, a derivative of pam373 carrying tn918 proved to be a useful delivery vehicle for generating transposon insertions into multiple sites on the staphylococcal chromosome.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of streptococcus.
AB  == a numerical taxonomic study of strains of streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. the major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (s. faecalis, s. faecium, 's. avium' and a proposed new species 's. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (s. bovis, s. equinus, s. salivarius, 's. casseliflavus', s. mutans, s. raffinolactis and an unidentified oral group i); (c) lactic species group (s. lactis including s. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (s. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (s. mitis, s. sanguis, a proposed new species 's. oralis' and 's. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. equi, 's. equisimilis' including 's. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of lancefield group b strains of human origin);  (g) parapyogenic species group (s. uberis, 's. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of lancefield groups r, s and t). species of aerococcus, gemella, leuconostoc and pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.

TI  == sorption of streptococci to glass: effects of macromolecular solutes.
AB  == macromolecular solutes (albumin, concanavalin a, whole saliva, serum) caused impaired sorption of streptococcus faecium and streptococcus sanguis to glass. the inhibitory effect resided chiefly with interactions of the solutes with the glass surface. in the case of sorption of s. sanguis to glass in the presence of  parotid fluid, the inhibitory effect was counteracted by a specific attachment of s. sanguis cells mediated by some component(s) of the parotid fluid. agglutination of the test organisms was in general accompanied by inhibition of sorption. however, when small or unstable aggregates were formed, the number of cells adhering on the glass surface was increased. the findings are discussed with reference to the colonization of teeth by oral bacteria.

TI  == acid production from lycasin, maltitol, sorbitol and xylitol by oral streptococci and lactobacilli.
AB  == the acid production from maltitol was compared with the acid production from hydrogenated starch hydrolysate (lycasin), sorbitol and xylitol by a number of oral strains and reference strains of streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. mitior, s. milleri, s. faecalis, s. faecium, s. avium, lactobacillus casei and l. salivarius. the polyols were added to a final concentration of 1.0% to two different basal media. incubation was performed at 37 degrees c for 7 days after which the ph was recorded. maltitol was fermented only by the lactobacilli (about two thirds of the strains). lycasin was fermented by all strains of s. faecalis, more than 90% of the lactobacilli, about half of the s. sanguis strains, about one third of the s. mutans strains, and by a few other streptococcal strains. acid production from sorbitol was observed among more than 80% of the s. mutans strains and the s. faecalis strains and most of the lactobacilli strains. sorbitol-fermenting strains of s. sanguis and of s. mitior, all isolated from sorbitol-consumers, were observed. no other sorbitol-fermenting streptococci were found. only the reference strains l. salivarius subsp. salivarius atcc 11741 and s. avium atcc 14025 fermented xylitol.
