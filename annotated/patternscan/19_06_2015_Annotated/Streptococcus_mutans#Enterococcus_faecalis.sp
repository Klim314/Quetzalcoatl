TI  == collagen-like peptide sequences inhibit bacterial invasion of root dentine.
AB  == aim: to investigate the effects of peptides derived from the sequence of collagen to inhibit penetration of human or bovine dentine by species of streptococci and  enterococci. methodology: blocks of human or bovine root dentine were infected for 14 d with bacterial cultures, in the presence or absence of various collagen-like peptide sequences. invasion of dentinal tubules was determined from microscopic images of histochemically stained dentine thin sections. extent of invasion was expressed as tubule invasion index (ti), or tubule invasion factor (tif) which, in addition to the density of invasion, took into account the depth  of invasion. data were analyzed by two-way anova. results: streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis were associated with heavy invasion (ti > 2.5, tif > 4) of human or bovine root dentinal tubules, with e. faecalis being the most penetrative. incorporation of peptides gly-pro-ala or  gly-pro-hyp into the in vitro model system significantly reduced (p < 0.05) dentine invasion by the three species of highly-invasive organisms. inhibition of bacterial invasion by the peptides was dose dependent, and the peptides did not inhibit bacterial growth in culture. conclusion: specific collagen-like peptide sequences inhibited the invasion of dentine in vitro by a range of oral bacteria. the peptides likely act as competitive inhibitors blocking bacterial collagen receptors and could potentially allow for target-specific control of dentine infections. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of zataria multiflora extract in comparison with chlorhexidine mouthwash on experimentally contaminated orthodontic elastomeric ligatures.
AB  == objectives: long-term use of orthodontic appliances and fixation ligatures creates a favorable environment for the accumulation of oral normal microflora and increases the risk of enamel demineralization and periodontal disease. the aim of this study was to compare the antimicrobial effects of zataria multiflora  extract and 0.2% chlorhexidine (chx) mouthwash on experimentally contaminated orthodontic elastomeric ligatures. materials and methods: in this lab trial study, iranian and foreign-made elastomeric ligatures were experimentally contaminated in streptococcus mutans, enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans  suspensions. ligatures were then decontaminated using 0.2% chx as the control, 0.5 mg/ml zataria multiflora extract mouthwashes as the test and phosphate buffered saline (pbs) as the negative control for one hour. antimicrobial properties of both solutions were evaluated by comparing the mean viable bacterial cell count on both rings after decontamination, using spss version 15 software. results: the mean viable bacterial cell count on iranian ligatures was  greater than that on foreign-made ligatures before disinfection (p=0.001), however this difference for c. albicans was not statistically significant (p=0.061). chlorhexidine mouthwash completely eliminated all tested microorganisms attached to both elastomeric rings, but zataria extract was only capable of completely eliminating c. albicans from both ligatures. statistically  significant differences were found in viable bacterial counts on both ligatures before and after disinfection with zataria extract (p=0.0001). conclusion: zataria multiflora extract has antimicrobial properties and can be used for disinfection of elastomeric ligatures. in vivo studies are required to evaluate the efficacy of the incorporation of this herbal extract in mouthwashes for orthodontic patients.

TI  == bactericidal activity of propylene glycol, glycerine, polyethylene glycol 400, and polyethylene glycol 1000 against selected microorganisms.
AB  == aim: the aim of the present study was to evaluate the bactericidal activity of propylene glycol, glycerine, polyethylene glycol 400 (peg 400), and polyethylene  glycol 1000 (peg 1000) against selected microorganisms in vitro. materials and methods: five vehicles, namely propylene glycol, glycerine, peg 400, peg 1000, and combination of propylene glycol with peg 400, were tested for their bactericidal activity. the minimum bactericidal concentration was noted against four standard strains of organisms, i.e. streptococcus mutans american type culture collection (atcc) 25175, streptococcus mutans atcc 12598, enterococcus faecalis atcc 35550, and escherichia coli atcc 25922, using broth dilution assay. successful endodontic therapy depends upon thorough disinfection of root canals.  in some refractory cases, routine endodontic therapy is not sufficient, so intracanal medicaments are used for proper disinfection of canals. intracanal medicaments are dispensed with vehicles which aid in increased diffusion through  the dentinal tubules and improve their efficacy. among the various vehicles used, glycerine is easily available, whereas others like propylene glycol and polyethylene glycol have to be procured from appropriate sources. also, these vehicles, being viscous, aid in sustained release of the medicaments and improve  their handling properties. the most commonly used intracanal medicaments like calcium hydroxide are ineffective on many microorganisms, while most of the other medicaments like mtad (mixture of tetracycline, an acid, and a detergent) and triple antibiotic paste (tap) consist of antibiotics which can lead to development of antibiotic resistance among microorganisms. thus, in order to use  safer and equally effective intracanal medicaments, newer alternatives like chlorhexidine gluconate, ozonized water, etc., are being explored. similarly, the five vehicles mentioned above are being tested for their antimicrobial activity in this study. results: all vehicles exhibited bactericidal activity at 100% concentration. conclusion: propylene glycol was effective against three organisms namely s. mutans e. faecalis and e. coli and its bactericidal activity was at 50%, 25% and 50% respectively. peg 1000 was effective against s. mutans and e. coli at 25%. hence propylene glycol was effective on more number of organisms of  which e. faecalis is a known resistant species. peg 1000 was bactericidal at a lower concentration but was effective on two organisms only.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of anacardium occidentale and mangifera indica in oral care.
AB  == background: oral health is an integral and important component of general health. infectious diseases such as caries, periodontal, and gingivitis indicate the onset of imbalance in homeostasis between oral micro biota and host. the present  day medicaments used in oral health care have numerous side effects. the uses of  herbal plants as an alternative have gained popularity due to side effects of antibiotics and emergence of multidrug resistant strains. anacardium occidentale  (cashew) and mangifera indica (mango) have been used as traditional oral health care measures in india since time immemorial. materials and methods: the ethanol  extracts of cashew and mango leaves were obtained by maceration method. the antimicrobial activity was evaluated by clear zone produced by these plant extracts against enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, escherichia coli, and candida albicans in agar plate method, determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration (mbc/mfc), and suppression of biofilm. the  cytotoxic effects of plants extract was determined by microculture tetrazolium assay on human gingival fibroblast and chinese hamster lung fibroblast (v79) cell lines. results: cashew and mango leaf extract significantly (p < 0.05) produced larger zone of inhibition against test pathogens when compared to povidone-iodine-based mouth rinses. although the mic and mbc/mfc values of mouth  rinses were effective in lower concentrations; plant extracts significantly (p <  0.001) suppressed the biofilms of oral pathogens. the leaf extracts were less cytotoxic (p < 0.001) compared to mouth rinses. conclusions: plant extracts are superior to the mouth rinses and have a promising role in future oral health care.

TI  == bactericidal activity and mechanism of photoirradiated polyphenols against gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
AB  == the bactericidal effect of various types of photoirradiated polyphenols against gram-positive and -negative bacteria was evaluated in relation to the mode of action. gram-positive bacteria (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus mutans) and gram-negative bacteria (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) suspended in a 1 mg/ml polyphenol aqueous solution (caffeic acid, gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, and proanthocyanidin) were exposed to led light (wavelength, 400 nm; irradiance, 260 mw/cm2) for 5 or 10 min. caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid exerted the highest bactericidal activity  followed by gallic acid and proanthocyanidin against both gram-positive and -negative bacteria. it was also demonstrated that the disinfection treatment induced oxidative damage of bacterial dna, which suggests that polyphenols are incorporated into bacterial cells. the present study suggests that blue light irradiation of polyphenols could be a novel disinfection treatment.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and stability of electron beam irradiated dental irrigants.
AB  == background: the electron beam (e-beam) radiation is considered as an effective means of sterilization of healthcare products as well as to induce the structural changes in the pharmaceutical agents/drug molecules. in addition to structural changes of pharmaceutical it also induces the formation of low molecular weight compounds with altered microbiological, physicochemical and toxicological properties. among the several known medicaments, sodium hypochlorite (naocl) and  chlorhexidine digluconate (chx) are used as irrigants in dentistry to kill the pathogenic microorganisms like enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans and candida albicans inhabiting the oral cavity. objectives: the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity and stability of e-beam irradiated dental irrigants, naocl and chx. materials and methods: two dental irrigants naocl (1.25% and 2.5%) and chx (1% and 2%) were exposed to various doses of e-beam radiation. the antimicrobial activities of e-beam irradiated irrigants were compared with the non-irradiated (control) irrigants against e. faecalis, s. aureus, s. mutans and c. albicans by disc diffusion method. following the storage, physico-chemical properties of the irrigants were  recorded and the cytotoxic effect was evaluated on human gingival fibroblast cells. result: the irrigants, 1.25% naocl and 1% chx showed significantly increased antimicrobial activity against both e. faecalis, (16+0.0) and s. aureus (25+0.0) after irradiation with 1 kgy e-beam. whereas, 2.5% naocl and 2% chx showed slightly increased antimicrobial activity only against s. aureus (28+0.0). the significant difference was noticed in the antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity of irradiated and non-irradiated irrigants following the storage for 180 d at 4(0)c. conclusion: the e-beam irradiation increased the antimicrobial activity of irrigants without altering the biocompatibility.

TI  == characterisation of the efficacy of endodontic medications using a three-dimensional fluorescent tooth model: an ex vivo study.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to establish a three-dimensional fluorescent tooth  model to investigate bacterial viability against intra-canal medicaments across the thickness and surface of root dentine. dental microbial biofilms (enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus mutans) were established on the external root surface and bacterial kill was monitored over time against intra-canal medicament (ca(oh)2 ) using fluorescent microscopy in conjunction with baclight syto9 and propidium iodide stains. an olympus digital camera fitted to szx16 fluorescent microscope captured images of bacterial cells in biofilms on the external root surface. viability of biofilm was measured by calculating the total pixel area of green (viable bacteria) and red (non-viable bacteria) for each image using imagej(r) software. all data generated were assessed for normality and then analysed using a mann-whitney t-test. the viability of s. mutans biofilm following ca(oh)2 treatment showed a significant decline compared with the untreated group (p = 0.0418). no significant difference was seen for e. faecalis  biofilm between the ca(oh)2 and untreated groups indicating ca(oh)2 medicament is ineffective against e. faecalis biofilm. this novel three-dimensional fluorescent biofilm model provides a new clinically relevant tool for testing of medicaments  against dental biofilms.

TI  == integration of non-oral bacteria into in vitro oral biofilms.
AB  == biofilms are polymicrobial communities that grow on surfaces in nature. oral bacteria can spontaneously form biofilms on the surface of teeth, which may compromise the health of the teeth, or their surrounding (periodontal) tissues. while the oral bacteria exhibit high tropism for their specialized ecological niche, it is not clear if bacteria that are not part of the normal oral microbiota can efficiently colonize and grow within oral biofilms. by using an in vitro "supragingival" biofilm model of 6 oral species, this study aimed to investigate if 3 individual bacterial species that are not part of the normal oral microbiota (eschericia coli, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecails) and one not previously tested oral species (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) can be incorporated into this established supragingival biofilm model. staphylococcus aureus and a. actinomycetemcomitans were able to grow efficiently in the biofilm, without disrupting the growth of the remaining species. they localized in sparse small aggregates within the biofilm mass. enterococcus faecalis and e. coli were both able to populate the biofilm at high  numbers, and suppressed the growth of a. oris and s. mutants. enterococcus faecalis was arranged in a chain-like conformation, whereas e. coli was densely and evenly spread throughout the biofilm mass. in conclusion, it is possible for  selected species that are not part of the normal oral microbiota to be introduced into an oral biofilm, under the given experimental micro-environmental conditions. moreover, the equilibrated incorporation of a. actinomycetemcomitans  and s. aureus in this oral biofilm model could be a useful tool in the study of aggressive periodontitis and peri-implantitis, in which these organisms are involved, respectively.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of different filling pastes for deciduous tooth treatment.
AB  == guedes-pinto paste is the filling material most employed in brazil for endodontic treatment of deciduous teeth; however, the rifocort(r) ointment has been removed. thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial potential of filling pastes, by proposing three new pharmacological associations to replace rifocort(r) ointment with drugs of already established antimicrobial power: nebacetin(r) ointment, 2% chlorhexidine gluconate gel, and maxitrol(r) ointment.  a paste composed of iodoform, rifocort(r) ointment and camphorated paramonochlorophenol (cpc) was employed as the gold standard (g1). the other associations were: iodoform, nebacetin(r) ointment and cpc (g2); iodoform, 2% chlorhexidine digluconate gel and cpc (g3); iodoform, maxitrol(r) ointment and cpc (g4). the associations were tested for staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), streptococcus mutans (s. mutans), streptococcus oralis (s. oralis), enterococcus  faecalis (e. faecalis), escherichia coli (e. coli), and bacillus subtilis (b. subtilis), using the methods of dilution on solid medium - orifice agar - and broth dilution. the results were tested using statistical analysis anova and kruskal-wallis. they showed that all the pastes had a bacteriostatic effect on all the microorganisms, without any statistically significant difference, compared with g1. s. aureus was statistically significant (multiple comparison test of tukey), insofar as g2 and g3 presented the worst and the best performance, respectively. all associations were bactericidal for e. coli, s. aureus, s. mutans and s. oralis. only g3 and g4 were bactericidal for e. faecalis, whereas no product was bactericidal for b. subtilis. thus, the tested pastes have antimicrobial potential and have proved acceptable for endodontic treatment of primary teeth.

TI  == antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties of pgla-am1, cpf-am1, and magainin-am1: potent activity against oral pathogens.
AB  == cationic amphipathic alpha-helical peptides are intensively studied classes of host defence peptides (hdps). three peptides, peptide glycine-leucine-amide (pgla-am1), caerulein-precursor fragment (cpf-am1) and magainin-am1, originally isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the african volcano frog xenopus amieti (pipidae), were studied for their antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities against oral and respiratory pathogens. minimal effective concentrations (mecs), determined by radial diffusion assay, were generally lower than minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) determined by microbroth dilution. pgla-am1 and cpf-am1 were particularly active against streptococcus mutans and all three peptides were effective against fusobacterium  nucleatum, whereas enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans proved to be relatively resistant micro-organisms. a type strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa was shown to be more susceptible than the clinical isolate studied. pgla-am1 displayed the greatest propensity to bind lipopolysaccharide (lps) from escherichia coli, p. aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. all three peptides  showed less binding to p. gingivalis lps than to lps from the other species studied. oral fibroblast viability was unaffected by 50 mum peptide treatments. production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine il-8 by oral fibroblasts was significantly increased following treatment with 1 or 10 mum magainin-am1 but not following treatment with pgla-am1 or cpf-am1. in conclusion, as well as possessing potent antimicrobial actions, the x. amieti peptides bound to lps from three human pathogens and had no effect on oral fibroblast viability. cpf-am1 and pgla-am1 show promise as templates for the design of novel analogues for the treatment of oral and dental diseases associated with bacteria or fungi.

TI  == improving photodynamic inactivation of bacteria in dentistry: highly effective and fast killing of oral key pathogens with novel tooth-colored type-ii photosensitizers.
AB  == increasing antibiotic resistances in microorganisms create serious problems in public health. this demands alternative approaches for killing pathogens to supplement standard treatment methods. photodynamic inactivation of bacteria (pib) uses light activated photosensitizers (ps) to generate reactive oxygen species immediately upon illumination, inducing lethal phototoxicity. positively  charged phenalen-1-one derivatives are a new generation of ps for light-mediated  killing of pathogens with outstanding singlet oxygen quantum yield phidelta of >97%. upon irradiation with a standard photopolymerizer light (bluephase c8, 1260 +/- 50 mw/cm(2)) the ps showed high activity against the oral key pathogens enterococcus faecalis, actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mutans, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. at a concentration of 10 mum, a maximum efficacy of more than 6 log10 steps (>/= 99.9999%) of bacteria killing is reached in less than 1 min (light dose 50 j/cm(2)) after one single treatment. the pyridinium substituent as positively charged moiety is especially advantageous for antimicrobial action.

TI  == antibacterial effect of iranian green-tea-containing mouthrinse vs chlorhexidine  0.2%: an in vitro study.
AB  == purpose: considering the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of green tea, this study aimed to evaluate the antibacterial effect of mouthrinses containing green tea extract vs 0.2% chlorhexidine on selected microorganisms in vitro. materials and methods: the antibacterial activity of both mouthrinses and the pure green tea extract was assessed by using disk diffusion and the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) methods against five microorganisms: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aerogenosa and escherichia coli. growth inhibition zones were measured in mm after 24 h of incubation at 37 degrees c. the two mouthrinses were assessed at concentrations of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 and 512 mg/ml to determine the mic, which was interpreted as the lowest concentration of the agent that completely inhibited the growth of the test species. results: 0.2% chlorhexidine produced a larger zone of growth inhibition than did the mouthrinse made of green tea extract (p < 0.01). paradoxically, the growth inhibition zones  of the tested bacteria were significantly larger in pure extract of green tea than in 0.2% chlorhexidine (p < 0.01). the chlorhexidine mouthrinse inhibited the growth of all tested species and exhibited significantly lower mics than did the  green tea mouthrinse (p < 0.01). conclusions: even though the mouthrinse made with green tea extract presented an in vitro antimicrobial activity inferior to 0.2% chlorhexidine, the pure extract had considerable bactericidal effect.

TI  == a comparison between antibacterial activity of propolis and aloe vera on enterococcus faecalis (an in vitro study).
AB  == removing the bacteria, including enterococcus faecalis, from the root canal is one of the important aims in endodontic treatment.we aimed to compare the antibacterial activity of chlorhexidine with two natural drugs. the antibacterial activities of three different propolis extracts (alcohol concentrations: 0, 15, 40%) and aloe vera gel on e. faecalis were compared using three methods: disk diffusion, microdilution and direct contact test. in addition to the above bacterium, the aloe vera gel effect on staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus mutans was evaluated. disk diffusion test revealed that propolis ethanolic extracts (the alcohol concentration of 15 and 40%) and aloe vera gel have antibacterial activities but aqueous extract of propolis did not show any effect  in this test. the mics for propolis ethanolic extracts, aloe vera gel and aqueous extract of propolis (0% alcohol) were 313 microg/ml, 750 microg/ml, 2250 microg/ml, and >/= 500 microg/ml respectively, much higher than the chlorhexidine one. in direct contact test, contrary to aloe vera, all three propolis extracts showed antibacterial effects on e. faecalis. the aloe vera gel also showed significant antibacterial effect on s.aureus and s.mutans. the hydroalcoholic extracts of propolis and aloe vera gel had antibacterial effects on e. faecalis,  however, propolis is more potent than aloe vera. the antibacterial effect of aloe vera on s. aureus and s. mutans is low (mic >/= 2250 microg/ml). appropriate concentrations of alcoholic extracts of propolis and some fractions of aloe vera  gel might be good choices for disinfecting the root canal in endodontic treatments.

TI  == gamma-alkylidene-gamma-lactones and isobutylpyrrol-2(5h)-ones analogues to rubrolides as inhibitors of biofilm formation by gram-positive and gram-negative  bacteria.
AB  == several molecules have been discovered that interfere with formation of bacterial biofilms, opening a new strategy for the development of more efficient treatments in case of antibiotic resistant bacteria. amongst the most active compounds are some natural brominated furanones from marine algae delisea pulchra that have proven to be able to control pathogenic biofilms. we have recently reported that  some rubrolide analogues are able to inhibit biofilm formation of enterococcus faecalis. in the present letter we describe results of the biological evaluation  of a small library of 28 compounds including brominated furanones and the corresponding lactams against biofilm formation of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus mutans. our  results showed that in general these compounds were more active against biofilms  of s. epidermidis and p. aeruginosa, with little or no inhibition of planktonic bacterial growth. in some cases they were able to prevent biofilm formation of p. aeruginosa at concentrations as low as 0.6 mug/ml (1.3 mum, compound 3d) and 0.7  mug/ml (1.3 mum, 3f). results also indicate that, in general, lactams are more active against biofilms than their precursors, thus designating this class of molecules as good candidates for the development of a new generation of antimicrobial drugs targeted to biofilm inhibition.

TI  == antibiotic resistance and capacity for biofilm formation of different bacteria isolated from endodontic infections associated with root-filled teeth.
AB  == introduction: to date, a variety of microbial species have been isolated from endodontic infections. however, endodontic clinical bacterial isolates have not been sufficiently characterized with regard to their capacity for antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation. in this study, antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation of 47 different aerobic and anaerobic bacterial isolates, belonging to 32 different species previously isolated from infected filled root canals, were studied. methods: antibiotic sensitivity to 11 antibiotics including penicillin g, amoxicillin, clindamycin, gentamicin, vancomycin, tetracycline, doxycycline, fosfomycin, rifampicin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin was tested using the standardized etest method (bio merieux, marcy-1'etoile, france). the antibiotic sensitivity of 4 control strains was also estimated in parallel. additionally, the capacity to form biofilms was quantified using the microtiter plate test. results: different aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species were either resistant against a number of antibiotics or showed high minimal inhibitory concentrations against clinically relevant antibiotics. five aerobic and 2 anaerobic isolates, including enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans,  lactobacillus fermentum, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, prevotella buccae, and propionibacterium acidifaciens, were characterized as being high biofilm producers, whereas 8 aerobic and 3 anaerobic isolates were found to be moderate biofilm producers. most isolates with resistance or markedly high minimal inhibitory concentration values were also either moderate biofilm producers or high biofilm producers. conclusions: these results suggest that the  clinical significance of endodontic infections could include that they serve as a reservoir for antibiotic resistance. furthermore, endodontic treatment should consider the adhesion and biofilm formation by a variety of bacteria.

TI  == prolonged delivery of ciprofloxacin and diclofenac sodium from a polymeric fibre  device for the treatment of periodontal disease.
AB  == in vitro analysis of drug release and antimicrobial activity of the coblended crosslinked polymeric fibre device (pfd) were investigated. the fibre loaded with ciprofloxacin and diclofenac sodium was comprised of alginate and glycerol crosslinked with barium cations. the ph dependent drug release was evident with ciprofloxacin and diclofenac sodium diffusing from the fibre at ph 4.0 compared to ph 6.8, where the fibre swelled and eroded resulting in zero-order drug release. agar diffusion studies followed by minimum inhibitory assays were conducted to determine the antimicrobial activity of the device against escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus mutans. the antimicrobial activity of the pfd was confirmed in both test assays against all test pathogens. the mic ranges at ph 4.0 for e. coli, e. faecalis, and s. mutans  were 0.5-0.8, 0.4-1.1, and 0.7-2.1 mug/ml, respectively. at ph 6.8, similar efficacies (0.3-0.5 mug/ml for e. coli and e. faecalis and 0.6-1.0 mug/ml for s.  mutans) were observed. the effect of varying the plasticizer and crosslinking ion concentration on drug release profile of the fibers was further elucidated and conceptualized using molecular mechanics energy relationships (mmer) and by exploring the spatial disposition of geometrically minimized molecular conformations.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection  treatment with photolysis of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 and comparing this with existing antibacterial agents. we tested seven antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin, cefepime hydrochloride, erythromycin, ofloxacin, clindamycin hydrochloride, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, and minocycline hydrochloride, as positive controls for validation of the assay protocol. for all of the agents tested, at least one of the four bacterial species (staphylococcus  aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and streptococcus salivarius) was resistant to these agents by repeated exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of the agents up to 10 times. in contrast, antibacterial activity  against any of the bacterial species tested (s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. coli, s.  salivarius, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus mutans, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) was not affected by repeated exposure to the disinfection  treatment up to 40 times. this finding suggested that the risk of inducing bacterial resistance by disinfection treatment was low. the active ingredient of  this disinfection treatment is hydroxyl radicals generated by photolysis of h2o2. therefore, hydroxyl radicals interact with several cell structures and different  metabolic pathways in microbial cells, probably resulting in a lack of development of bacterial resistance. in conclusion, disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 appears to be a potential alternative for existing antimicrobial agents in terms of a low risk of inducing bacterial resistance.

TI  == antibacterial efficacy of a human beta-defensin-3 peptide on multispecies biofilms.
AB  == introduction: the aggregation of mixed bacterial flora into sessile biofilms on root canal surfaces can be one of the causes of persistent apical periodontitis.  the aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of human beta-defensin-3 (hbd3) peptide on multispecies biofilms by using confocal laser scanning microscopy. methods: actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus salivarius, streptococcus mutans, and enterococcus faecalis were cultured in a peptone-yeast-glucose broth, and their culture suspensions were combined in equal proportions. the mixed bacteria were inoculated on sterile coverslips placed into the wells of tissue culture plates to permit the formation of mixed species biofilm. after incubation for 3 weeks, the samples were treated for 24 hours with saline (control), saturated calcium hydroxide solution (ch), 2% chlorhexidine solution (chx), and 50 mug/ml hbd3 solution. a commercial biofilm/viability assay kit was used to assess cell viability and analyze the 3-dimensional architecture  of biofilms. the percentage of dead cells was determined from the ratio of biovolumes for the red subpopulation and the total biofilm. results: three medication groups showed a significant reduction of biovolume within the biofilms compared with the control group (p < .001). the hbd3-treated biofilms had a higher percentage of dead cells than the other medication groups (p < .05). the ch and chx groups showed higher levels of bactericidal activity than saline (p <  .05), and there was no significant difference between the 2 groups (p > .05). conclusions: hbd3 peptide exhibited more antibacterial activity against mature multispecies biofilms in vitro than either ch or chx.

TI  == lipoteichoic acid of streptococcus mutans interacts with toll-like receptor 2 through the lipid moiety for induction of inflammatory mediators in murine macrophages.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is a pathogenic gram-positive bacterium that is closely associated with dental caries and subsequent pulpal inflammation. although lipoteichoic acid (lta) is considered a major virulence factor of gram-positive bacteria, little is known about the innate immunity to s. mutans lta. in this study, we purified lta from s. mutans (sm.lta) through n-butanol extraction, hydrophobic interaction column chromatography, and ion-exchange column chromatography to investigate its immunological properties using murine macrophages. the sm.lta preparation had no detectable contamination with endotoxins, proteins, or nucleic acids. upon exposure to sm.lta, the murine macrophage cell-line raw 264.7 cells produced tnf-alpha and nitric oxide (no) in  a dose-dependent manner. sm.lta preferentially bound to and activated cho/cd14/tlr2 cells rather than cho/cd14/tlr4 cells, which are stable transfectants expressing cd14 and tlr2 or cd14 and tlr4, respectively. sm.lta could not induce tnf-alpha or no production in macrophages derived from tlr2-deficient mice whereas it dose-dependently induced those inflammatory mediators in wild-type macrophages. tlr2-dependent induction of no by sm.lta was  also confirmed in raw 264.7 cells using specific antibodies blocking tlr2. furthermore, sm.lta deacylated by alkaline hydrolysis neither stimulated tlr2 nor induced tnf-alpha or no production, suggesting that sm.lta lipid moieties are crucial for the immuno-stimulatory activity of sm.lta. unlike staphylococcus aureus lta, which has potent immuno-stimulating activity, sm.lta showed a modest  induction of no production comparable to ltas of other oral bacteria enterococcus faecalis and lactobacillus plantarum. in conclusion, our results suggest that the sm.lta interacts with tlr2 through the lipid moiety for the induction of inflammatory mediators in macrophages.

TI  == [comparison of in vitro antimicrobial activities of bioaggregate and mineral trioxide aggregate].
AB  == treatment outcome of endodontic perforations depends on successful elimination of the associated microorganisms and infected tissues as well as the effective seal  of the root-end or perforation site to prevent future contamination. ideally, perforation repair material has to be bacteriostatic or bactericidal in order to  prevent bacterial contamination as well as good sealing properties and biocompatibility. the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of bioaggregate (ba) and mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) on the standard strains of candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis and pseudomonas aeruginosa using the agar disc diffusion test. colonies of each strains were harvested from the medium and microorganisms were diluted to obtain a suspension of approximately 108 cfu/ml. petri plates with blood agar base with 5% sheep blood or sabouraud dextrose agar  (for c.albicans) were inoculated with experimental suspensions and ba and mta discs prepared as 2 mm length and 6 mm diameter were placed. after 24 and 48 hours incubation, the diameters of the zones of inhibition were measured. the results of the disc diffusion tests showed that ba and mta were effective on the  tested microorganisms at 24 and 48 hours incubation periods. ba and mta showed similar antimicrobial effects on c.albicans and e.coli. ba was more effective than mta on s.mutans, e.faecalis and p.aeruginosa, however mta was more effective than ba on s.sanguinis at 48 hours. when the time efficiency of the materials were compared, there was no statistically difference between 24 to 48 hours on e.coli, e.faecalis, s.mutans, s.sanguinis in both two groups (p> 0.05). there was statistically significant decrease 24 to 48 hours on c.albicans in ba and mta groups and p.aeruginosa in ba group (p< 0.05). it can be concluded that although  ba and mta displayed similar antimicrobial efficacy on the tested microorganisms  newly improved material ba demonstrated superior antimicrobial activity than other.

TI  == effect of metalloporphyrins on red autofluorescence from oral bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the red autofluorescence from bacterial species related to dental caries and periodontitis in the presence of different nutrients in the growth medium. bacteria were grown anaerobically on tryptic soy  agar (tsa) supplemented with nutrients, including magnesium-porphyrins from spinach and iron-porphyrins from heme. the autofluorescence was then assessed at  405 nm excitation. on the tsa without additives, no autofluorescence was observed from any of the species tested. on the tsa containing sheep blood, red autofluorescence was observed only from parvimonas micra. when the tsa was supplemented with blood, hemin, and vitamin k, red autofluorescence was observed  from actinomyces naeslundii, bifidobacterium dentium, and streptococcus mutans. finally, on the tsa supplemented with spinach extract, red autofluorescence was observed from aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a. naeslundii, enterococcus  faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus salivarius, s. mutans, and veillonella parvula. we conclude that the bacteria related to dental caries and periodontal disease exhibit red autofluorescence. the autofluorescence characteristics of the tested strains depended on the nutrients present, such as  metalloporphyrins, suggesting that the metabolic products of the oral biofilm could be responsible for red autofluorescence.

TI  == diversity of streptococcus mutans strains in bacterial interspecies interactions.
AB  == biofilms are matrix-enclosed microbial population adhere to each other and to surfaces. compared to planktonic bacterial cells, biofilm cells show much higher  levels of antimicrobial resistance. we aimed to investigate streptococcus mutans  strain diversity in biofilm formation and chlorhexidine (chx) resistance of single s. mutans and dual s. mutans-enterococcus faecalis biofilms. four clinical s. mutans strains (c180-2, c67-1, hg723 and ua159) formed 24-h biofilms with or without an e. faecalis strain. these biofilms were treated for 10 min with 0.025% chx. biofilm formation, chx resistance and s.mutans-e. faecalis interactions were evaluated by biomass staining, resazurin metabolism, viable count and competition agar assays. the main finding is that the presence of e. faecalis generally reduced all dual-species biofilm formation, but the proportions of s. mutans in the dual-species biofilms as well as chx resistance displayed a clear s. mutans strain dependence. in particular, decreased resistance against chx was observed in dual s. mutans c67-1 biofilms, while increased resistance was found in dual s. mutans ua159 biofilms. in conclusion, the interaction of s. mutans with e. faecalis in biofilms varies between strains, which underlines the importance of studying strain diversity in inter-species virulence modulation and biofilm antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == antimicrobial photodynamic therapy using visible light plus water-filtered infrared-a (wira).
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt) using visible light together with water-filtered infrared-a (vis+wira) to eradicate single species of planktonic bacteria and micro-organisms during initial oral bacterial colonization in situ. a broadband vis+wira radiator with a water-filtered spectrum in the range 580-1400 nm was used for irradiation. toluidine blue (tb) was utilized as a photosensitizer at concentrations of 5, 10, 25 and 50 microg ml(-1). the unweighted (absolute) irradiance was 200 mw cm(-2) and it was applied for 1 min. planktonic cultures of streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis were treated with apdt. salivary bacteria harvested by centrifugation of native human saliva were also tested. in  addition, initial bacterial colonization of bovine enamel slabs carried in the mouths of six healthy volunteers was treated in the same way. up to 2 log(10) of  s. mutans and e. faecalis were killed by apdt. salivary bacteria were eliminated  to a higher extent of 3.7-5 log(10). all tb concentrations tested proved to be highly effective. the killing rate of bacteria in the initial oral bacterial colonization was significant (p=0.004) at all tested tb concentrations, despite the interindividual variations found among study participants. this study has shown that apdt in combination with tb and vis+wira is a promising method for killing bacteria during initial oral colonization. taking the healing effects of  wira on human tissue into consideration, this technique could be helpful in the treatment of peri-implantitis and periodontitis.

TI  == lantibiotic production by pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  == lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesised, post-translationally modified antimicrobial peptides produced by gram positive bacteria, many which have broad-ranging antimicrobial activities. lantibiotics have long been the subject of investigation with a view to their application as food preservatives or chemotherapeutic agents for clinical and veterinary medicine, while the associated biosynthetic machinery has been employed for peptide engineering purposes. however, although many lantibiotics are produced by generally regarded  as safe or food-grade bacteria, it is increasingly apparent that a number of gram positive pathogens, including strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus uberis and enterococcus faecalis, also produce these compounds. it is proposed that production of these antimicrobials may provide the associated microorganisms with a competitive advantage when colonizing/infecting  a host, thereby enhancing the virulence of the producing strain. here we review the production of lantibiotics by these pathogens and discuss how their production may contribute to their disease-causing potential.

TI  == isolation and characterization of signermycin b, an antibiotic that targets the dimerization domain of histidine kinase walk.
AB  == the walk (histidine kinase)/walr (response regulator) two-component signal transduction system is a master regulatory system for cell wall metabolism and growth. this system is conserved in low g+c gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus mutans. in this study, we found the first antibiotic that functions as a walk inhibitor (signermycin b) by screening 10,000 streptomyces extracts. the chemical structure (c(23)h(35)no(4); molecular weight, 389.5) comprises a tetramic acid moiety and a decalin ring. signermycin b exhibited antimicrobial activity, with mic values ranging from 3.13 mug/ml (8 mum) to 6.25 mug/ml (16 mum) against gram-positive bacteria that possess the walk/walr two-component signal transduction system, including the drug-resistant bacteria methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis. the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of signermycin b against walk in these organisms ranged from 37 to 61 mum. to determine the mechanism of action of signermycin b, surface plasmon resonance response analysis with the two walk domains of bacillus subtilis and competition assay with atp were performed.  the results showed that signermycin b binds to the dimerization domain but not the atp-binding domain of walk. in the presence of the cross-linker glutaraldehyde, signermycin b did not cause protein aggregation but interfered with the cross-linking of walk dimers. these results suggest that signermycin b targets the conserved dimerization domain of walk to inhibit autophosphorylation. in bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus, signermycin b preferentially controlled the walr regulon, thereby inhibiting cell division. these phenotypes are consistent with those of cells starved for the walk/walr system.

TI  == bactericidal activity and oral pathogen inactivation by electromagnetic wave irradiation.
AB  == aims: the aim of this work was to clarify the effects of electromagnetic wave irradiation (emwi) on oral bacterial pathogens. methods and results: a gram-negative (porphyromonas gingivalis) or gram-positive (streptococcus mutans,  s. intermedius, enterococcus faecalis) bacterial suspension was irradiated by emw apparatus (500-1000 khz, 5-15 times, 1 s time(-1) ). quantification of survival bacteria by cfu counting revealed that emwi exhibited marked bactericidal activity against all tested bacteria and bactericidal activity at 500 khz increased in an irradiation number-dependent manner. after emwi at 500 khz, scanning electron microscopic observations showed that the chain of s. mutans cells was shortened after 5 irradiations and the outlines of bacterial cells (s.  mutans and p. gingivalis) were unclear after 5-10 irradiations. emwi inhibited the inductive effect of s. mutans on pro-inflammatory cytokine production in human monocytes and this inhibitory effect was comparable with that of heat-killed bacteria. furthermore, using an enzyme activity assay, emwi partially inactivated the activities of gingipains from p. gingivalis. conclusions: these findings demonstrated that emwi has inactivation and bactericidal activities against single microbial species among four kinds of oral pathogens. significance and impact of the study: electromagnetic wave irradiation may be applicable for medical disinfection and sterilization, such as refractory periapical periodontitis.

TI  == inhibition of candida albicans yeast-hyphal transition and biofilm formation by solidago virgaurea water extracts.
AB  == xerostomia is a decrease of saliva secretion, which can unbalance the oral microflora, mainly to the benefit of candida albicans. the aim of the present study was to find a plant extract that could create an unfavourable environment for candida, and would, therefore, be appropriate for use in a dry-mouth daily-care mouthwash. water extract from the herbaceous plant solidago virgaurea  (goldenrod) was selected due to its saponin content (plant detergents). saponin concentrations reached 0.7 and 0.95 mg ml(-1) in s. virgaurea subsp. virgaurea and s. virgaurea subsp. alpestris extracts, respectively. c. albicans was grown in liquid medium and cells were counted by microscopic examination after 0, 4 and 24 h of incubation. solidago extracts did not inhibit the growth of c. albicans (four strains), escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius or enterococcus faecalis. when inocula were incubated with solidago extract for 4 and 24 h, we observed a decrease in candida yeast-hyphal transition. candida biofilms were then prepared  in microtitre plates and treated with plant extracts at 0 h, to estimate biofilm  formation, or at 18 h to estimate the effect of the saponin on pre-formed biofilms. biofilm formation and pre-formed biofilms were both strongly inhibited. in conclusion, the s. virgaurea extract was efficient against two key virulence factors of c. albicans: the yeast-hyphal transition phase and biofilm formation.

TI  == effect of a novel antimicrobial peptide chrysophsin-1 on oral pathogens and streptococcus mutans biofilms.
AB  == dental caries and pulpal diseases are common oral bacterial infectious diseases.  controlling and reducing the causative pathogens, such as streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis, is a key step toward prevention and treatment of the two diseases. chrysophsin-1 is a cationic antimicrobial peptide having broad-spectrum bactericidal activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. in this study, we investigated the antibacterial activity of chrysophsin-1 against several oral pathogens and s. mutans biofilms and performed a preliminary study of the antimicrobial mechanism. cytotoxic activity of chrysophsin-1 against human gingival fibroblasts (hgfs) was investigated. minimal inhibitory concentration (mic), minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) and time-kill assay were used to evaluate the killing effect of chrysophsin-1. scanning electron microscopy (sem) was used to analyze morphological and membrane change in oral pathogens. live/dead staining, in conjunction with confocal scanning laser microscopy (cslm), was used to observe and analyze s. mutans biofilms. mic and mbc results demonstrated that chrysophsin-1 had different antimicrobial activities against the tested oral microbes. lysis and pore formation of the cytomembrane were observed following treatment of the bacteria with chrysophsin-1 for 4h or 24h by sem. furthermore, clsm images showed that chrysophsin-1 remarkably reduced the viability of cells within biofilms and had a significantly lethal effect against s. mutans biofilms. toxicity studies showed that chrysophsin-1 at concentration between 8 mug/ml and 32 mug/ml had little effect on viability of hgfs in 5 min. our findings suggest that chrysophsin-1 may have potential clinical applications in the prevention and treatment of dental caries and pulpal diseases.

TI  == salivary iga antibody responses to streptococcus mitis and streptococcus mutans in preterm and fullterm newborn children.
AB  == objectives: the intensities and specificities of salivary iga antibody responses  to antigens of streptococcus mutans, the main pathogen of dental caries, may influence colonization by these organisms during the first 1.5 year of life. thus, the ontogeny of salivary iga responses to oral colonizers continues to warrant investigation, especially with regard to the influence of birth conditions, e.g. prematurity, on the ability of children to efficiently respond to oral microorganisms. in this study, we characterised the salivary antibody responses to two bacterial species which are prototypes of pioneer and pathogenic microorganisms of the oral cavity (streptococcus mitis and streptococcus mutans,  respectively) in fullterm (ft) and preterm (pt) newborn children. methods: salivas from 123 infants (70 ft and 53 pt) were collected during the first 10h after birth and levels of iga and igm antibodies and the presence of s. mutans and s. mitis were analysed respectively by elisa and by chequerboard dna-dna hybridization. two subgroups of 24 ft and 24 pt children were compared with respect to patterns of antibody specificities against s. mutans and s. mitis antigens, using western blot assays. cross-adsorption of 10 infant's saliva was tested to s. mitis, s. mutans and enterococcus faecalis antigens. results: salivary levels of iga at birth were 2.5-fold higher in ft than in pt children (mann-whitney; p<0.05). salivary iga antibodies reactive with several antigens of s. mitis and s. mutans were detected at birth in children with undetectable levels of those bacteria. adsorption of infant saliva with cells of s. mutans produced a reduction of antibodies recognizing s. mitis antigens in half of the neonates. the diversity and intensity of iga responses were lower in pt compared  to ft children, although those differences were not significant. conclusion: these data provide evidence that children have salivary iga antibodies shortly after birth, which might influence the establishment of the oral microbiota, and  that the levels of salivary antibody might be related to prematurity.

TI  == extracellular dna in biofilms.
AB  == extracellular dna (edna) is an important biofilm component that was recently discovered. its presence has been initially observed in biofilms of pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, then enterococcus faecalis and staphylococci. autolysis is the common mechanism by which edna is released. in p. aeruginosa edna is generated by lysis of a bacterial subpopulation, under control of quorum sensing system. in e. faecalis autolysis proceeds in a fratricide mode, resulting from a process similar to necrosis of eukaryotic cells. in staphylococcus aureus autolysis originates by an altruistic  suicide, i.e., a programmed cell death similar to apoptosis of eukaryotic cells.  in s. aureus autolysis is mediated by murein hydrolase, while in s. epidermidis by the autolysin protein atle. in p. aeruginosa edna is located primarily in the  stalks of mushroom-shaped multicellular structures. in s. aureus the crucial role of edna in stabilizing biofilm is highlighted by the disgregating effect of dnase i. edna represents an important mechanism for horizontal gene transfer in bacteria. edna and other microbial structural motifs are recognized by the innate immune system via the tlr family of pattern recognition receptors (prrs).

TI  == synergistic effect of thermal energy on bactericidal action of photolysis of h(2)o(2) in relation to acceleration of hydroxyl radical generation.
AB  == the purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effect of thermal energy on the yield of and the bactericidal action of hydroxyl radical generated by photolysis of h(2)o(2). different concentrations of h(2)o(2) (250, 500, 750, and  1,000 mm) were irradiated with light-emitting diodes (leds) at a wavelength of 400 +/- 20 nm at 25 degrees c to generate hydroxyl radical. the 500 mm h(2)o(2) was irradiated with the leds at different temperatures (25, 35, 45, and 55 degrees c). electron spin resonance spin trapping analysis showed that the yield  of hydroxyl radicals increased with the temperature, as well as the concentration of h(2)o(2). streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis were used in the bactericidal assay. the led-light irradiation of the bacterial suspensions in 500 mm h(2)o(2) at 25 degrees c could hardly kill the bacteria within 3 min, while the bactericidal effect was markedly enhanced with the temperature rise. for instance, a temperature increase to 55 degrees c resulted in >99.999% reduction of viable counts of both bacterial species only within 1 min. the photolysis of 500 mm h(2)o(2) at 55 degrees c could reduce the viable counts of bacteria more efficiently than did the photolysis of 1,000 mm h(2)o(2) at 25 degrees c, although the yields of hydroxyl radical were almost the same under the both conditions. these findings suggest that the thermal energy accelerates the generation of hydroxyl radical by photolysis of h(2)o(2), which in turn results in a synergistic bactericidal effect of hydroxyl radical and thermal energy.

AB  == five new silver(i) complexes of formulas [ag(tpms)] (1), [ag(tpms)(pph(3))] (2),  [ag(tpms)(pcy(3))] (3), [ag(pta)][bf(4)] (4), and [ag(tpms)(pta)] (5) {tpms = tris(pyrazol-1-yl)methanesulfonate, pph(3) = triphenylphosphane, pcy(3) = tricyclohexylphosphane, pta = 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane} have been synthesized and fully characterized by elemental analyses, (1)h, (13)c, and (31)p nmr, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (esi-ms), and ir spectroscopic techniques. the single crystal x-ray diffraction study of 3 shows the tpms ligand acting in the n(3)-facially coordinating mode, while in 2 and 5 a n(2)o-coordination is found, with the so(3) group bonded to silver and a pendant  free pyrazolyl ring. features of the tilting in the coordinated pyrazolyl rings in these cases suggest that this inequivalence is related with the cone angles of the phosphanes. a detailed study of antimycobacterial and antiproliferative properties of all compounds has been carried out. they were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activities against the standard strains enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29922), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923), streptococcus pneumoniae (atcc  49619), streptococcus pyogenes (sf37), streptococcus sanguinis (sk36), streptococcus mutans (ua159), escherichia coli (atcc 25922), and the fungus candida albicans (atcc 24443). complexes 1-5 have been found to display effective antimicrobial activity against the series of bacteria and fungi, and some of them are potential candidates for antiseptic or disinfectant drugs. interaction of ag  complexes with deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) has been studied by fluorescence spectroscopic techniques, using ethidium bromide (eb) as a fluorescence probe of  dna. the decrease in the fluorescence of dna-eb system on addition of ag complexes shows that the fluorescence quenching of dna-eb complex occurs and compound 3 is particularly active. complexes 1-5 exhibit pronounced antiproliferative activity against human malignant melanoma (a375) with an activity often higher than that of agno(3), which has been used as a control, following the same order of activity inhibition on dna, i.e., 3 > 2 > 1 > 5 > agno(3)>> 4.

TI  == bacterial and candida albicans adhesion on different root canal filling materials and sealers.
AB  == introduction: microbial adhesion and subsequent biofilm formation on endodontic root canal filling materials and sealers lead to survival of microorganisms in treated root canals and subsequently to endodontic treatment failures. the present study focused on initial microbial adhesion to different endodontic filling materials. methods: the following endodontic biomaterials were tested: ah-plus, tubli seal, gutta-percha, real seal se, endorez, apexit plus, guttaflow, and dentin. samples of each material were prepared. bovine dentin samples were used as a control. the initial adhesions of salivary bacteria as well as the subsequent single species were quantified by determination of colony-forming units (cfus) and visualized by scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy (clsm): enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, candida albicans, and prevotella nigrescens. results: initially adherent microorganisms could be detected and microscopically visualized on each of the materials tested. considering the values of the cfus and the covering grade as detected by clsm, there were significant differences among the materials. fewer bacteria tended to adhere to apexit plus, whereas real seal se and the widely used gutta-percha showed the highest number of adherent bacteria. this tendency was not detected for c. albicans. conclusions: endodontic microorganisms have a high affinity to root canal filling materials and sealers, especially to gutta-percha. because of this high level of bacterial adhesion, subsequent biofilm formation on these materials could be suggested as leading to the persistence of microorganisms in root canals.

TI  == persistent, toxin-antitoxin system-independent, tetracycline resistance-encoding  plasmid from a dairy enterococcus faecium isolate.
AB  == a tetracycline-resistant (tet(r)) dairy enterococcus faecium isolate designated m7m2 was found to carry both tet(m) and tet(l) genes on a 19.6-kb plasmid. after  consecutive transfer in the absence of tetracycline, the resistance-encoding plasmid persisted in 99% of the progenies. dna sequence analysis revealed that the 19.6-kb plasmid contained 28 open reading frames (orfs), including a tet(m)-tet(l)-mob gene cluster, as well as a 10.6-kb backbone highly homologous (99.9%) to the reported plasmid pre25, but without an identified toxin-antitoxin  (ta) plasmid stabilization system. the derived backbone plasmid without the tet(r) determinants exhibited a 100% retention rate in the presence of acridine orange, suggesting the presence of a ta-independent plasmid stabilization mechanism, with its impact on the persistence of a broad spectrum of resistance-encoding traits still to be elucidated. the tet(m)-tet(l) gene cluster from m7m2 was functional and transmissible and led to acquired resistance in enterococcus faecalis og1rf by electroporation and in streptococcus mutans ua159  by natural transformation. southern hybridization showed that both the tet(m) and tet(l) genes were integrated into the chromosome of s. mutans ua159, while the whole plasmid was transferred to and retained in e. faecalis og1rf. quantitative  real-time reverse transcription-pcr (rt-pcr) indicated tetracycline-induced transcription of both the tet(m) and tet(l) genes of pm7m2. the results indicated that multiple mechanisms might have contributed to the persistence of antibiotic  resistance-encoding genes and that the plasmids pm7m2, pip816, and pre25 are likely correlated evolutionarily.

TI  == high-level fluorescence labeling of gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == fluorescence labeling of bacterial pathogens has a broad range of interesting applications including the observation of living bacteria within host cells. we constructed a novel vector based on the e. coli streptococcal shuttle plasmid pat28 that can propagate in numerous bacterial species from different genera. the plasmid harbors a promoterless copy of the green fluorescent variant gene egfp under the control of the camp-factor gene (cfb) promoter of streptococcus agalactiae and was designated pbsu101. upon transfer of the plasmid into streptococci, the bacteria show a distinct and easily detectable fluorescence using a standard fluorescence microscope and quantification by facs-analysis demonstrated values that were 10-50 times increased over the respective controls. to assess the suitability of the construct for high efficiency fluorescence labeling in different gram-positive pathogens, numerous species were transformed. we successfully labeled streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus aureus strains utilizing the egfp reporter plasmid pbsu101. in all of these species the presence of the cfb promoter construct resulted in high-level egfp expression that could be further increased by growing the streptococcal and enterococcal cultures under high oxygen conditions through continuous aeration.

TI  == comparison of bacterial adhesion and cellular proliferation on newly developed three-dimensional scaffolds manufactured by rapid prototyping technology.
AB  == scaffolds used in the field of tissue engineering should facilitate the adherence, spreading, and ingrowth of cells as well as prevent microbial adherence. for the first time, this study simultaneously deals with microbial and tissue cell adhesion to rapid prototyping-produced 3d-scaffolds. the cell growth  of human osteosarcoma cells (cal-72) over a time period of 3-11 days were examined on three scaffolds (plga, plla, plla-tcp) and compared to the adhesion of salivary microorganisms and representative germs of the oral flora (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, candida albicans, enterococcus  faecalis, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sanguinis). scanning electron microscopy (sem), cell proliferation measurements, and determination of the colony forming units (cfu) were performed. the cell proliferation rates on plla and plla-tcp after 3, 7, and 11 days of cultivation were higher than on plga. on  day 3 the proliferation rates on plla and plla-tcp, and on day 5 on plla-tcp, proved to be significantly higher compared to that of the control (culture plate). the strain which showed the most cfus on all of the investigated scaffolds was p. gingivalis, followed by e. faecalis. no significant cfu differences were determined examining p. gingivalis among the biomaterials. in contrast, e. faecalis was significantly more adherent to plga and plla compared to plla-tcp. the lowest cfu values were seen with c. albicans and p. nigrescens.  salivary born aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms adhered significantly more to  plga compared to plla-tcp. these results supported by sem point out the high potential of plla-tcp in the field of tissue engineering.

TI  == microbicidal activities of low frequency atmospheric pressure plasma jets on oral pathogens.
AB  == research using low frequency atmospheric pressure plasma jets (lf jet) is becoming increasingly more common. we carried out experiments to evaluate the sterilizing effects of this technology on oral pathogenic microorganisms (s.mutans, c.albicans and e. faecalis) and to determine its potential for clinical application. we performed the direct exposure test on a solid surface, indirect exposure test on a liquid phase, and ros (reactive oxygen species) inhibitory test. the results showed the lf jet had microbicidal effects on oral pathogens, and that the ros influenced this sterilization effect. the experiments of this study revealed that lf jet had a sterilizing effect on oral pathogenic microorganisms present in both the solid and liquid phases. the sterilizing mechanism was considered to be related to the effect of superoxide anion radicals. these results indicate that lf jets may represent a novel technology that can be applied to the field of clinical dentistry.

TI  == evaluating the in-vitro antibacterial effect of iranian propolis on oral microorganisms.
AB  == propolis has traditionally been used in curing infections and healing wounds and  burns. current researches have shown that propolis has antibacterial, antifungal  and antiviral actions however, the pharmacological activity of propolis is highly variable depending on its geographic origin. there have been few studies on the effects of iranian propolis on the oral microorganisms. in this in-vitro study, the antimicrobial activity of the ethanolic and water extracts of the iranian propolis (10%, w/v) from north-east area of tehran was evaluated. susceptibility  of the oral strains tested (streptococcus mutans atcc 35668; streptococcus salivarius atcc 9222; staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923; enterococcus faecalis atcc 9854 and lactobacillus casei atcc 39392) was evaluated using the agar diffusion method at a concentration of 20 mg/ml of propolis and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. antibacterial activity was determined by using minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) at different concentrations of propolis. the ethanolic extract showed bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity against all the strains, with mic and mbc ranges of 250-500 microg/ml. the mic concentration of the water extract was 500 microg/ml against s. mutans and e. faecalis. the water extract showed bactericidal activity only against s. mutans (20 mg/ml). these results indicate that the ethanolic extract is probably more useful in the control of oral biofilms and subsequent dental caries development. however, to determine the consequence of the ethanolic extract of iranian propolis on the oral mucosa, in-vivo studies of its possible effects are needed.

TI  == effect of garlic on bacterial biofilm formation on orthodontic wire.
AB  == objective: to examine the effect of garlic extract on the biofilm formation by streptococcus mutans on orthodontic wire and on glucosyltransferase gene expression. materials and methods: growth inhibition of oral bacteria was tested  after 50 microl of garlic extract was placed on an agar plate. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of garlic extract on s mutans growth was first determined. after cultivating streptococci in biofilm medium (bm)-sucrose with garlic extract and orthodontic wire, adenosine triphosphate (atp) measurement and viable cell counting was performed from the bacteria attached on the wire. scanning electron microscopy (sem) analysis of morphology was observed on bacterial cells attached to orthodontic wire. the effect of garlic extract on gene expression was evaluated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) of glucosyltransferase. results: though garlic extract had a clear antibacterial effect on all microorganisms, it also enhanced s mutans attachment  on orthodontic wire. low concentration of garlic extract also increased glucosyltransferase gene expression of s mutans. conclusions: despite its antibacterial function, garlic extract increases biofilm formation by s mutans to orthodontic wire, likely through upregulation of glucosyltransferase expression.  garlic extract may thus play an important role in increased bacterial attachment  to orthodontic wires.

TI  == streptococcus
AB  == the genus streptococcus , a heterogeneous group of gram-positive bacteria, has broad significance in medicine and industry. various streptococci are important ecologically as part of the normal microbial flora of animals and humans; some can also cause diseases that range from subacute to acute or even chronic. among  the significant human diseases attributable to streptococci are scarlet fever, rheumatic heart disease, glomerulonephritis, and pneumococcal pneumonia. streptococci are essential in industrial and dairy processes and as indicators of pollution. the nomenclature for streptococci, especially the nomenclature in medical use, has been based largely on serogroup identification of cell wall components rather than on species names. for several decades, interest has focused on two major species that cause severe infections: s pyogenes (group a streptococci) and s pneumoniae (pneumococci). in 1984, two members were assigned  a new genus - the group d enterococcal species (which account for 98% of human enterococcal infections) became enterococcus faecalis (the majority of human clinical isolates) and e faecium (associated with a remarkable capacity for antibiotic resistance). in recent years, increasing attention has been given to other streptococcal species, partly because innovations in serogrouping methods have led to advances in understanding the pathogenetic and epidemiologic significance of these species. a variety of cell-associated and extracellular products are produced by streptococci, but their cause-effect relationship with pathogenesis has not been defined. some of the other medically important streptococci are s agalactiae (group b), an etiologic agent of neonatal disease;  e faecalis (group d), a major cause of endocarditis, and the viridans streptococci. particularly for the viridans streptococci, taxonomy and nomenclature are not yet fully reliable or consistent. important members of the viridans streptococci, normal commensals, include s mutans and s sanguis (involved in dental caries), s mitis (associated with bacteremia, meningitis, periodontal disease and pneumonia), and "s milleri" (associated with suppurative  infections in children and adults). there remains persistent taxonomic confusion  regarding "s milleri." these and other streptococci of medical importance are listed intable 13-1by serogroup designation, normal ecologic niche, and associated disease.

AB  == introduction: endodontic infections are caused by polymicrobial biofilms. therefore, novel root canal disinfectants should be evaluated not only on single-species biofilms but also on dual- or mixed-species biofilms. a simple, high-throughput assay is urgently needed for this. in this study, the application of the resazurin metabolism assay was investigated for the evaluation of a root canal disinfectant on dual-species biofilms. methods: enterococcus faecalis with  or without streptococcus mutans in biofilms were formed in an active attachment biofilm model for 24 hours. subsequently, the biofilms were treated with various  concentrations of naocl for 1 minute. after resazurin metabolism by both organisms was confirmed, treatment efficacies using 0.0016% resazurin were evaluated. results: during naocl treatments, resazurin metabolism displays a clear dose response, not only in single-species e. faecalis (or s. mutans) biofilms but also in dual-species biofilms. notably, the assay revealed that the  resistance of dual-species biofilms to naocl was 30-fold higher than in single-species e. faecalis biofilms. viability counts on a selected naocl treatment (0.004%) confirmed this result and showed the increased resistance of e. faecalis in dual-species biofilms. conclusions: clearly, the high-throughput and low cost resazurin metabolism assay has a great potential for testing novel root canal antimicrobial agents in mixed-species biofilms.

AB  == the essential oil of rosmarinus officinalis l. (rosemary) was obtained by hydro-distillation and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. sixty-two constituents were identified, representing 98.06% of the total oil content. oxygenated monoterpenes were the predominant components. the rosemary oil was characterized as having prominent (> 5%) contents of camphor (18.9%), verbenone (11.3%), a-pinene (9.6%), beta-myrcene (8.6%), 1,8-cineole (8.0%), and  beta-caryophyllene (5.1%). the antimicrobial activity of the oil as well as of its major constituents was tested against the following microorganisms: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, and enterococcus faecalis, which are potentially responsible for the formation of dental caries in humans. the microdilution method was used for determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) during evaluation of the antibacterial activity. the essential oil displayed low activity against the selected microorganisms. in the  present study, the pure major compounds were more active than the essential oil.  among all the microorganisms tested, the pathogen s. mitis was the most susceptible and e. faecalis was the most resistant to the evaluated samples. this is the first report on antimicrobial activity of the major components of rosemary oil against oral pathogens.

AB  == proper knowledge of antibiotic resistance (ar) dissemination is essential for effective mitigation. this study examined the profiles of tetracycline-resistant  (tetr) commensal bacteria from representative ready-to-consume food samples from  salad bars at local grocery stores and restaurants. out of 900 tetr isolates examined, 158 (17.6%) carried one or more of tetm, tetl, tets, and tetk genes by  conventional pcr, 28 harbored more than one tetr determinants. the most prevalent genotype was tetm, which was detected in 70.9% of the ar gene carriers, followed  by tetl (31.6%), tets (13.9%), and tetk (2.5%). identified ar gene carriers included enterococcus, lactococcus, staphylococcus, brochothrix, carnobacterium,  stenotrophomonas, pseudomonas, and sphingobacterium, by 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. ar determinants were successfully transmitted, and led to resistance in streptococcus mutans via natural gene transformation and enterococcus faecalis via electroporation, suggesting the functionality and mobility of the ar genes from the food commensal bacteria. in addition, the ar traits in many isolates are quite stable, even in the absence of the selective pressure. the identification of new commensal carriers for representative ar genes revealed the involvement of a broad spectrum of bacteria in the horizontal transmission of ar genes. meanwhile, the spectrum of the antibiotic-resistant bacteria differed from the spectrum of the total bacteria (by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) associated with the food items. our data revealed a common avenue in ar exposure  and will assist in proper risk assessment and the development of comprehensive mitigation strategies to effectively combat ar.

TI  == effect of chlorhexidine incorporation into a self-etching primer on dentine bond  strength of a luting cement.
AB  == objectives: this study investigated the effect of incorporating chlorhexidine in  a self-etching primer on the bond strength of an adhesive resin cement to dentine and on antibacterial activity. methods: experimental self-etching primers were prepared by adding chlorhexidine (chx) diacetate to ed primer 2.0 (kuraray medical inc.) to obtain chlorhexidine concentrations of 1.0 wt% and 2.0 wt%. human occlusal dentine surfaces were conditioned for 30 s using the experimental  primers or pure ed primer. composite blocks were luted using panavia f 2.0 (kuraray medical inc.). after storage in water for 24 h, the bonded teeth were sectioned into 0.9 mm x 0.9 mm beams and stressed to failure in tension to examine microtensile bond strength (microtbs). fractured surfaces were examined with a field-emission scanning electron microscopy (fe-sem). the morphology of dentine surfaces that were conditioned with each primer was also observed under fe-sem. an agar diffusion test was performed to examine the antibacterial effect  of each primer against streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis. results: addition of chlorhexidine to the primer had significant effects (p<0.001) on microtbs and antibacterial effect. no significant difference in microtbs was found between the groups that contained 0% and 1% chlorhexidine in the primer (p=0.095). conversely, the group that contained 2% chlorhexidine showed significantly lower microtbs and pronounced cohesive failures within the thin layer of the primer. conclusions: incorporation of chlorhexidine into ed primer 2.0 showed significant antibacterial activities. conditioning with the 1% chlorhexidine-containing primer had no adverse effect on microtbs.

TI  == antibacterial activity of root canal filling materials for primary teeth: zinc oxide and eugenol cement, calen paste thickened with zinc oxide, sealapex and endorez.
AB  == this study evaluated in vitro the antibacterial activity of 4 root canal filling  materials for primary teeth - zinc oxide and eugenol cement (zoe), calen paste thickened with zinc oxide (calen/zo), sealapex sealer and endorez sealer - against 5 bacterial strains commonly found in endodontic infections (kocuria rhizophila, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus) using the agar diffusion test (agar-well technique). calen paste, 1% chlorhexidine digluconate (chx) and distilled water served as controls. seven wells per dish were made at equidistant points and immediately filled with  the test and control materials. after incubation of the plates at 37 degrees c for 24 h, the diameter of the zones of bacterial growth inhibition produced around the wells was measured (in mm) with a digital caliper under reflected light. data were analyzed statistically by analysis of variance and tukey's post-hoc test (alpha=0.05). there were statistically significant differences (p<0.0001) among the zones of bacterial growth inhibition produced by the different materials against all target microorganisms. k. rhizophila was inhibited more effectively (p<0.05) by zoe, while calen/zo had its highest antibacterial activity against e. faecalis (p<0.05). s. mutans was inhibited by calen/zo, sealapex and zoe in the same intensity (p>0.05). e. coli was inhibited  more effectively (p<0.05) by zoe, followed by calen/zo and sealapex. calen/zo and zoe were equally effective (p>0.05) against s. aureus, while sealapex had the lowest antibacterial efficacy (p<0.05) against this microorganism. endorez presented antibacterial activity only against k. rhizophila and s. aureus. the calen paste and calen/zo produced larger zones of inhibition than 1% chx when the marker microorganism was e faecalis. in conclusion, the in vitro antibacterial activity of the 4 root canal filling materials for primary teeth against bacterial strains commonly found in endodontic infections can be presented in a decreasing order of efficacy as follows: zoe>calen/zo>sealapex>endorez.

TI  == infective endocarditis: identification of catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci  from blood cultures by partial 16s rrna gene analysis and by vitek 2 examination.
AB  == streptococci, enterococci and streptococcus-like bacteria are frequent etiologic  agents of infective endocarditis and correct species identification can be a laboratory challenge. viridans streptococci (vs) not seldomly cause contamination of blood cultures. vitek 2 and partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene were applied in order to compare the results of both methods. strains originated from  two groups of patients: 149 strains from patients with infective endocarditis and 181 strains assessed as blood culture contaminants. of the 330 strains, based on  partial 16s rrna gene sequencing results, 251 (76%) were vs strains, 10 (3%) were pyogenic streptococcal strains, 54 (16%) were e. faecalis strains and 15 (5%) strains belonged to a group of miscellaneous catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci. among vs strains, respectively, 220 (87,6%) and 31 (12,3%) obtained agreeing and non-agreeing identifications with the two methods with respect to allocation to the same vs group. non-agreeing species identification mostly occurred among strains in the contaminant group, while for endocarditis strains notably fewer disagreeing results were observed.only 67 of 150 strains in the mitis group strains obtained identical species identifications by the two methods. most vs strains belonging to the groups of salivarius, anginosus, and mutans obtained agreeing species identifications with the two methods, while this only was the case for 13 of the 21 bovis strains. pyogenic strains (n=10), enterococcus faecalis strains (n=54) and a miscellaneous group of catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci (n=15) seemed well identified by both methods, except that disagreements in identifications in the miscellaneous group  of strains occurred for 6 of 15 strains.

AB  == this study evaluated the antibacterial effects of 4-acryloyloxyethyl trimellitate anhydride/methyl methacrylate-tri-n-butylborane (4-meta/mma-tbb) resin containing chlorhexidine (chx) digluconate. the chx was incorporated into the resins at varying concentrations from 0.0 (control) to 3.0%. the antibacterial effect of each resin against seven microorganisms was examined using agar diffusion tests.  growth inhibition of two streptococci was also tested in brain heart infusion (bhi) liquid broth containing each resin. release of chx was analyzed using hplc, and enamel and dentin bond strengths of each resin were measured. in the agar diffusion tests, growth of all the microorganisms was inhibited by the resin specimens containing chx at 1.0% or higher except for enterococcus faecalis. there was greater sensitivity in streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus  than in the other bacteria tested. complete growth inhibition of these two streptococci was observed in bhi liquid broth containing 1.0-1.5% or greater chx-incorporated resin. according to hplc analysis, 1.0% and 1.5% chx-containing  resins released means of 3.63 and 8.59 microg/ml of chx, respectively. specimens  with 0.5-1.5% and 0.5-2.0% chx exhibited no significant reduction in enamel and dentin bond strengths, respectively, when compared to the control (p > 0.05). this in vitro study suggested that incorporation of 1.0-1.5% chx digluconate into the 4-meta resin is optimal in terms of antibacterial effects and bond strength to the tooth.

TI  == diagnodent laser fluorescence assessment of endodontic infection.
AB  == introduction: real-time assessment of the microbial status of the root canal system would be useful in clinical endodontic practice for determining endpoints  of biomechanical treatment. this laboratory study used an existing laser fluorescence device, the diagnodent (kavo, biberach, germany), in a proof-of-concept study. methods: visible laser red light (wavelength 655 nm) was  used to elicit fluorescence emissions in the near-infrared range from infected and uninfected root canals. a prototype sapphire tip designed for periodontal assessment was used to analyze the pulp chamber and coronal third of the root canal system in extracted teeth. the fluorescence properties of bacterial cultures, monospecies biofilms in root canals, pulpal soft tissues, and sound dentin were also evaluated, together with 50 extracted teeth with known endodontic pathology. results: sound dentin and healthy pulpal soft tissue gave an average fluorescence reading of 5 (on a scale of 100), whereas biofilms of enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus mutans established in root canals showed  a progressive increase in fluorescence over time. fluorescence readings reduced to the "healthy" threshold reading of 5 when root canals were endodontically treated, and the experimentally created bacterial biofilms were removed completely. high fluorescence readings were recorded in the root canals and pulp  chambers of extracted teeth with radiographic evidence of periapical pathology and scanning electron microscopy evidence of bacterial infection. conclusions: the use of the diagnodent fluorescence approach for the assessment of the status  of the pulp chamber and root canal system holds promise for clinical application; once more, flexible tips can be developed for gaining greater penetration into middle and apical thirds of the root canal.

TI  == comparative evaluation of antimicrobial activity of three cements: new endodontic cement (nec), mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) and portland.
AB  == using the agar diffusion method, we conducted an in vitro study to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of mineral trioxide aggregate (mta), new endodontic cement (nec) and portland cement at different concentrations against five different microorganisms. a base layer was made using muller-hinton agar for escherichia coli (atcc 10538) and candida (atcc 10231). for actinomyces viscosus (atcc 15987), enterococcus faecalis (atcc 10541) and streptococcus mutans (atcc 25175)  blood agar medium was used. wells were formed by removing the agar, and the materials were placed in the well immediately after manipulation. the plates were kept at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion, and then incubated at 37 degrees c for 72 h. the inhibition zones were then measured. the data were analyzed using anova and the tukey test to compare the differences among the three cements at different concentrations. the positive controls showed bacterial growth, while the negative controls showed no bacterial growth. all materials showed antimicrobial activity against the tested strains except for enterococcus  faecalis. nec created larger inhibition zones than mta and portland cement. this  difference was significant for portland cement (p < 0.05), but not for mta (p > 0.05). among the examined microorganisms, the largest inhibition zone was observed for actinomyces group (p < 0.05). the antimicrobial activity of the materials increased with time and concentration (p < 0.05). it was concluded that nec is a potent inhibitor of microorganism growth.

TI  == influence of streptococcus mutans on enterococcus faecalis biofilm formation.
AB  == introduction: an important virulence factor of enterococcus faecalis is its ability to form biofilms. most studies on biofilm formation have been carried out by using e. faecalis monocultures. given the polymicrobial nature of root canal infections, it is important to understand biofilm formation of e. faecalis in the presence of other microorganisms. methods: eight clinical strains of e. faecalis  were tested for biofilm formation on hydroxyapatite disks in the presence and absence of a streptococcus mutans biofilm. results: significantly more e. faecalis viable cells were found in biofilms in the presence of s. mutans. this phenomenon was, however, strain-dependent. of the 8 strains tested, biofilm formation of strains aa-or34, er5/1, and v583 was not influenced by s. mutans biofilms. conclusions: the results from this study, especially the strain difference, underline the importance of studying biofilm formation in a more realistic multispecies setting.

TI  == effect of three methods for cleaning dentures on biofilms formed in vitro on acrylic resin.
AB  == purpose: the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of three denture hygiene methods against different microbial biofilms formed on acrylic resin specimens. materials and methods: the set (sterile stainless steel basket and specimens) was contaminated (37 degrees c for 48 hours) by a microbial inoculum with 10(6) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml (standard strains: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, escherichia coli, candida albicans, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococcus faecalis; field strains: s. mutans, c. albicans, c.  glabrata, and c. tropicalis). after inoculation, specimens were cleansed by the following methods: (1) chemical: immersion in an alkaline peroxide solution (bonyplus tablets) for 5 minutes; (2) mechanical: brushing with a dentifrice for  removable prostheses (dentu creme) for 20 seconds; and (3) a combination of chemical and mechanical methods. specimens were applied onto a petri plate with appropriate culture medium for 10 minutes. afterward, the specimens were removed  and the plates incubated at 37 degrees c for 48 hours. results: chemical, mechanical, and combination methods showed no significant difference in the reduction of cfu for s. aureus, s. mutans (atcc and field strain), and p. aeruginosa. mechanical and combination methods were similar and more effective than the chemical method for e. faecalis, c. albicans (atcc and field strain), and c. glabrata. the combination method was better than the chemical method for e. coli and c. tropicalis, and the mechanical method showed intermediate results. conclusion: the three denture hygiene methods showed different effects depending  on the type of microbial biofilms formed on acrylic base resin specimens.

TI  == combination of 10% edta, photosan, and a blue light hand-held photopolymerizer to inactivate leading oral bacteria in dentistry in vitro.
AB  == aims: the goal of this study was to investigate the phototoxicity of photosan in  combination with edta and a hand-held photopolymerizer used in dentistry for light-curing resins against leading key pathogens in caries, endodontic treatment failures, and periodontitis respectively. methods and results: cellular uptake of photosan was detected by fluorescence spectroscopy for streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis but not for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. addition of 10% edta enabled the uptake of photosan by a. actinomycetemcomitans. killing of s. mutans and e. faecalis mediated by photosan and blue light was concentration and light dose dependent, achieving a >or=99.9% (>or=3 log(10) reduction) efficacy of bacteria killing. in the presence of 10% edta, photosan induced a reduction of >or=4 log(10) in the viability of a. actinomycetemcomitans at a concentration of 50 microg ml(-1), upon activation at a dose of 9.65 j cm(-2) for 60 s. edta alone, light alone, and photosan alone were not able to kill bacteria. conclusions: ten per cent edta and photosan cause a potent phototoxicity against oral bacteria upon illumination with a photopolymerizer. significance and impact of the study: increasing antibiotic resistance and insufficient drug concentrations within the sulcus fluid are responsible for lacking antimicrobial efficacy. this study provides useful information that combination of photosan, edta, and a photopolymerizer may be a potentially powerful tool for the efficient destroying of key oral bacteria.

TI  == tgf-beta1 inhibits tlr-mediated odontoblast responses to oral bacteria.
AB  == tgf-beta1 exerts diverse functions in tooth development and tissue repair, but its role in microbial defenses of the tooth is not well-understood. odontoblasts  extending their cellular processes into the dentin are the first cells to recognize signals from tgf-beta1 and bacteria in carious dentin. this study aimed to determine the role of tgf-beta1 in modulating odontoblast responses to oral bacteria. we show that these responses depend upon the expression levels of microbial recognition receptors tlr2 and tlr4 on the cell surface. porphyromonas  gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum activated both tlrs, but tlr4 played a greater role. lack of cell-surface tlr2 was associated with poor response to streptococcus mutans, enterococcus faecalis, and lactobacillus casei. tgf-beta1 inhibited tlr2 and tlr4 expression and attenuated  odontoblast responses. our findings suggest that the balance between tlr-mediated inflammation and tgf-beta1 anti-inflammatory activity plays an important role in  pulpal inflammation.

AB  == the aim of this study was to analyse the frequency and expression of biosynthesis genes in 47 streptococcus mutans isolates with different mutacin-producing phenotypes. detection of the frequency and expression of genes encoding mutacin types i, ii, iii and iv were carried out by pcr and semi-quantitative rt-pcr, respectively, using primers specific for each type of biosynthesis gene. in addition, a further eight genes encoding putative bacteriocins, designated bsm 283, bsm 299, bsm 423, bsm 1889c, bsm 1892c, bsm 1896, bsm 1906c and bsm 1914, were also screened. there was a high phenotypic diversity; some streptococcus mutans isolates presented broad antimicrobial spectra against other streptococcus mutans clinical isolates, including bacteria resistant to common antibiotics, as  well as staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis  and streptococcus pyogenes. the expression frequency of the bsm gene was higher than that of the previously characterized mutacins (i-iv). there was no positive  correlation between the number of indicator strains inhibited (antimicrobial spectra) and the number of biosynthesis genes expressed (spearman correlation test, r=-0.03, p>0.05). in conclusion, the high diversity of mutacin-producing phenotypes, associated with high frequency of expression of the biosynthesis genes screened, reveals a broad repertoire of genetic determinants encoding antimicrobial peptides that can act in different combinations.

TI  == purification of bacteriocin ls1 produced by human oral isolate lactobacillus salivarius bgho1.
AB  == introduction: lactobacillus salivarius bgho1, a human oral isolate with antagonistic activity against growth of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus flavus, and salmonella enteritidis, probably produces more than one proteinaceous antimicrobial substance. the objective of this study was the purification of a bacteriocin, named ls1, produced by l. salivarius bgho1. methods: a simple and fast procedure for bacteriocin purification was developed, consisting of reverse-phase chromatography of the ammonium sulfate precipitate of cell-free culture supernatant by fast protein liquid chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography, followed by tricine sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide  gel electrophoresis (sds-page), with the subsequent extraction of bacteriocin from the gel. results: the supernatant of l. salivarius bgho1 culture retained its antimicrobial activity after boiling in a water bath for 15 min. its antimicrobial activity was also maintained even after treatment for 20 min at 121 degrees c in an autoclave. bacteriocin ls1 was purified to homogeneity. the molecular mass of bacteriocin ls1 was estimated to be approximately 10 kda, based on tricine sds-page. during purification, another compound with antimicrobial activity, produced by l. salivarius bgho1, was detected. the molecular mass of this compound was estimated to be approximately 5 kda, based on tricine sds-page. conclusion: our results imply that ls1 is most probably a new bacteriocin, different from previously described bacteriocins produced by l. salivarius strains. the purification of bacteriocin ls1 enabled the further characterization of ls1 on both the molecular and genetic levels.

TI  == bacterial profiles of root caries in elderly patients.
AB  == culture-based studies have shown that streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli are associated with root caries (rc). the purpose of the present study was to assess  the bacterial diversity of rc in elderly patients by use of culture-independent molecular techniques and to determine the associations of specific bacterial species or bacterial communities with healthy and carious roots. plaque was collected from root surfaces of 10 control subjects with no rc and from 11 subjects with rc. the bacterial 16s rrna genes from extracted dna were pcr amplified, cloned, and sequenced to determine species identity. from a total of 3,544 clones, 245 predominant species or phylotypes were observed, representing eight bacterial phyla. the majority (54%) of the species detected have not yet been cultivated. species of selenomonas and veillonella were common in all samples. the healthy microbiota included fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, leptotrichia spp., selenomonas noxia, streptococcus cristatus, and kingella oralis. lactobacilli were absent, s. mutans was present in one, and actinomyces spp. were present in 50% of the controls. in contrast, the microbiota of the rc subjects was dominated by actinomyces spp., lactobacilli, s. mutans, enterococcus faecalis, selenomonas sp. clone cs002, atopobium and olsenella spp., prevotella multisaccharivorax, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and propionibacterium sp. strain fma5. the bacterial profiles of rc showed considerable subject-to-subject variation, indicating that the microbial communities are more complex than previously presumed. the data suggest that putative etiological agents of rc include not only s. mutans, lactobacilli, and actinomyces but also species of atopobium, olsenella, pseudoramibacter, propionibacterium, and selenomonas.

TI  == bacterial and candida albicans adhesion on rapid prototyping-produced 3d-scaffolds manufactured as bone replacement materials.
AB  == rapid prototyping (rp)-produced scaffolds are gaining increasing importance in scaffold-guided tissue engineering. microbial adhesion on the surface of replacement materials has a strong influence on healing and long-term outcome. consequently, it is important to examine the adherence of microorganisms on rp-produced scaffolds. this research focussed on manufacturing of scaffolds by 3d-bioplotting and examination of their microbial adhesion characteristics. tricalciumphosphate (tcp), calcium/sodium alginate, and poly(lactide-co-glycolic  acid) (plga) constructs were produced and used to study the adhesion of dental pathogens. six oral bacterial strains, one candida strain and human saliva were used for the adhesion studies. the number of colony forming units (cfu) were determined and scanning electron microscopy (sem) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) were performed. microorganisms adhered to all scaffolds. all strains, except for streptococcus oralis, adhered best to plga scaffolds. streptococcus oralis adhered to each of the biomaterials equally. streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis adhered best to plga scaffolds, followed by alginate and tcp. prevotella nigrescens, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus  sanguis, and candida albicans showed the highest adherence to plga, followed by tcp and alginate. in contrast, the microorganisms of saliva adhered significantly better to tcp, followed by plga and alginate. sem observations correlated with the results of the cfu determinations. clsm detected bacteria within deeper sheets of alginate. in conclusion, because of the high adherence rate of oral pathogens to the scaffolds, the application of these biomaterials for bone replacement in oral surgery could result in biomaterial-related infections. strategies to decrease microbial adherence and to prevent infections due to oral  pathogens are discussed.

TI  == coronal microleakage of two root-end filling materials using a polymicrobial marker.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate polymicrobial coronal leakage of mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) and amalgam. there were 108 single-rooted teeth  randomly divided into 3 groups of 32 teeth each and positive and negative control groups of 6 teeth and obturated with gutta percha and either diaket (3m/espe, seefeld, germany), ah plus (dentsply, de trey, konstanz, germany), or ketac endo  (3m/espe). these groups were further divided into 2 subgroups of 16 teeth in which root ends were resected and obturated with either mta or zinc-free amalgam. the samples have been incorporated in a dual-chamber leakage model with a polymicrobial marker of five facultative anaerobes on the coronal part. leakage was observing during a period of 90 days. the least leakage was found in a combination of diaket and mta (76.9 +/-14.8 days) followed by ah plus and mta (66.1 +/- 18.7), diaket and amalgam (60.0 +/- 23.1), ah plus and amalgam (56.9 +/- 22.1), and ketac endo and mta (42.1 +/- 17.8), whereas the greatest leakage was observed in the ketac endo and amalgam group (40.0 +/- 17.24). samples filled with mta showed significantly better sealing than samples filled with amalgam (p  < 0.05).

TI  == antimicrobial action of a filling paste used in pulp therapy in primary teeth under different storage conditions.
AB  == objective: compare the antimicrobial effectiveness of common antimicrobial paste  immediately after pulp therapy and in different storage conditions. study design: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, enterococcus faecalis; escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis sample were used. the storage conditions utilized were: at room temperature--the paste was subjected to a natural aging process at room temperature for a 24-hour and 7, 14, 28, 60 and 90 day periods (gprt). refrigerator storage--the paste was placed to a natural aging process in a refrigerator at 4 degrees c for a 24 hour and 7.14, 28, 60 and 90 day periods (gpr). to perform the immediate effect analysis (gpi or zero time), of each mixture either at room or refrigerator temperature, the preparation procedure was similar, although gpr, iodoform, rifocort and camphorated paramonochlorophenol were stored in the refrigerator and then taken out, dosed and manipulated, and had their immediate effect tested after a 1-week period at storage of 4 degrees c average temperature. the testing methodology was dilution in solid medium-agar. the wilcoxon test and friedman variance analyses were used. results: the gp paste showed antimicrobial activity at all experimental times. conclusion: the pastes presented antimicrobial effectiveness at all experimental times.

TI  == antibacterial activity of triterpene acids and semi-synthetic derivatives against oral pathogens.
AB  == triterpene acids (ursolic, oleanoic, gypsogenic, and sumaresinolic acids) isolated from miconia species, along with a mixture of ursolic and oleanolic acids and a mixture of maslinic and 2-a-hydroxyursolic acids, as well as ursolic  acid derivatives were evaluated against the following microorganisms: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, and enterococcus faecalis, which are potentially responsible for the formation of dental caries in humans. the microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) during the evaluation of the antibacterial activity. all the  isolated compounds, mixtures, and semi-synthetic derivatives displayed activity against all the tested bacteria, showing that they are promising antiplaque and anticaries agents. ursolic and oleanolic acids displayed the most intense antibacterial effect, with mic values ranging from 30 microg/ml to 80 microg/ml.  the mic values of ursolic acid derivatives, as well as those obtained for the mixture of ursolic and oleanolic acids showed that these compounds do not have higher antibacterial activity when compared with the activity observed with either ursolic acid or oleanolic acid alone. with regard to the structure-activity relationship of triterpene acids and derivatives, it is suggested that both hydroxy and carboxy groups present in the triterpenes are important for their antibacterial activity against oral pathogens.

TI  == effect of tissue fluids on hydrophobicity and adherence of enterococcus faecalis  to dentin.
AB  == this in vitro study was carried out to determine (1) the hydrophobicity of selected oral bacteria, (2) the influence of growth media (saliva and serum) and  mode of growth (planktonic or biofilm) on the hydrophobicity of enterococcus faecalis, and (3) the influence of growth media and conditioning fluids on the adherence of e. faecalis to dentin. the ability to bind to a hydrocarbon phase (xylene) was used as an index of relative hydrophobicity of cells. fluorescent microscopy-based technique was used to assay the bacterial adherence to dentin. results showed that bacteria involved in the primary stage of oral biofilm formation such as streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis are relatively more hydrophobic than e. faecalis. the hydrophobicity of e. faecalis was significantly increased during starvation and biofilm mode of growth (p < .05). the adherence of e. faecalis to dentin was appreciably increased after starvation and when dentin was conditioned with saliva. it was observed that surface conditioning of dentin with saliva and starvation can enhance the adherence of e. faecalis to dentin. the findings from  this study indicated that the coronal leakage of saliva and the physiologic state of microbes might play an important role in the adherence and biofilm formation of bacteria to root canal dentin.

TI  == surface antibacterial properties of glass ionomer cements used in atraumatic restorative treatment.
AB  == background: atraumatic restorative treatment (art) is recommended for use worldwide, not only in developing countries where resources are not readily available, but also in more industrialized countries. the antibacterial properties of restorative dental materials may improve the restorative treatment  outcome. glass ionomer cement (gic) has been advocated as the preferred restoration material for art. the authors evaluated the antibacterial properties  of restorative materials-three gics and a zinc oxide eugenol (zoe)-in vitro. methods: streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus and enterococcus faecalis were the test microorganisms. the authors used a quantitative microtiter spectrophotometric assay to evaluate the antibacterial effect of the restorative  materials using the direct contact test (dct) of freshly prepared and one-week-aged materials. results: the freshly prepared gics and zoe showed no bacterial growth in all tested bacteria compared with a control. this effect lasted for at least one week for s. mutans and a. viscosus but not for e. faecalis. conclusions: conventional gics used in art showed antibacterial surface properties against cariogenic bacteria for at least one week. further study on the long-term antimicrobial effects of gics is needed. clinical implications: the antimicrobial properties of freshly prepared restorative materials and aged restorative materials used in art have a potent effect against cariogenic bacteria. these properties have crucial importance in preventing secondary caries.

TI  == isolation and characterization of unsaturated fatty acid auxotrophs of streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans.
AB  == unsaturated fatty acid (ufa) biosynthesis is essential for the maintenance of membrane structure and function in many groups of anaerobic bacteria. like escherichia coli, the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae produces straight-chain saturated fatty acids (sfa) and monounsaturated fatty acids. in e. coli ufa synthesis requires the action of two gene products, the essential isomerase/dehydratase encoded by faba and an elongation condensing enzyme encoded by fabb. s. pneumoniae lacks both genes and instead employs a single enzyme with  only an isomerase function encoded by the fabm gene. in this paper we report the  construction and characterization of an s. pneumoniae 708 fabm mutant. this mutant failed to grow in complex medium, and the defect was overcome by addition  of ufas to the growth medium. s. pneumoniae fabm mutants did not produce detectable levels of monounsaturated fatty acids as determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and thin-layer chromatography analysis of the radiolabeled phospholipids. we also demonstrate that a fabm null mutant of the cariogenic organism streptococcus mutants is a ufa auxotroph, indicating that fabm is the only enzyme involved in the control of membrane fluidity in streptococci. finally we report that the fabn gene of enterococcus faecalis, coding for a dehydratase/isomerase, complements the growth of s. pneumoniae fabm  mutants. taken together, these results suggest that fabm is a potential target for chemotherapeutic agents against streptococci and that s. pneumoniae ufa auxotrophs could help identify novel genes encoding enzymes involved in ufa biosynthesis.

TI  == molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
AB  == introduction: the objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. methods: samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. on the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. the isolates were determined as lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16s rdna. sequencing of 16s rdna genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies  levels. results: predominant species were lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus  plantarum, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus cellobiosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and lactobacillus gasseri were also present. the isolates lactobacillus salivarius bgho1, lactobacillus fermentum bgho36 and bgho64, lactobacillus gasseri bgho89 and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis  bgho99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus flavus, salmonella enteritidis, streptococcus  pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of candida albicans. moreover, the isolates l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 were tolerant to low ph and high concentration of bile salts. conclusion: taken together, these findings imply that l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.

TI  == functional characterization and me ion specificity of a ca-citrate transporter from enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == secondary transporters of the bacterial citmhs family transport citrate in complex with a metal ion. different members of the family are specific for the metal ion in the complex and have been shown to transport mg(2+)-citrate, ca(2+)-citrate or fe(3+)-citrate. the fe(3+)-citrate transporter of streptococcus mutans clusters on the phylogenetic tree on a separate branch with a group of transporters found in the phylum firmicutes which are believed to be involved in  anaerobic citrate degradation. we have cloned and characterized the transporter from enterococcus faecalis efcith in this cluster. the gene was functionally expressed in escherichia coli and studied using right-side-out membrane vesicles. the transporter catalyzes proton-motive-force-driven uptake of the ca(2+)-citrate complex with an affinity constant of 3.5 microm. homologous exchange is catalyzed with a higher efficiency than efflux down a concentration gradient. analysis of the metal ion specificity of efcith activity in right-side-out membrane vesicles  revealed a specificity that was highly similar to that of the bacillus subtilis ca(2+)-citrate transporter in the same family. in spite of the high sequence identity with the s. mutans fe(3+)-citrate transporter, no transport activity with fe(3+) (or fe(2+)) could be detected. the transporter of e. faecalis catalyzes translocation of citrate in complex with ca(2+), sr(2+), mn(2+), cd(2+) and pb(2+) and not with mg(2+), zn(2+), ni(2+) and co(2+). the specificity appears to correlate with the size of the metal ion in the complex.

TI  == purification and functional studies of a potent modified quorum-sensing peptide and a two-peptide bacteriocin in streptococcus mutans.
AB  == bacteria use quorum-sensing signals or autoinducers to communicate. the signals in gram-positive bacteria are often peptides activated by proteolytic removal of  an n-terminal leader sequence. while investigating stimulation of antimicrobial peptide production by the streptococcus mutans synthetic competence stimulating peptide signal (21-csp), we found a peptide similar to the 21-csp, but lacking the three c-terminal amino acid residues (18-csp). the 18-csp was more potent in  inducing competence, biofilm formation, and antimicrobial activity than the 21-csp. our results indicate that cleavage of the three c-terminal residues occurred post export, and was not regulated by the csp-signalling system. deletion of comd encoding the csp receptor abolished the competence and biofilm responses to the 21-csp and the 18-csp, suggesting that signal transduction via the comd receptor is involved in the responses to both csps. in s. mutans gs5, beside the 18-csp we also purified to homogeneity a two-peptide bacteriocin which production was stimulated by the 18-csp and the 21-csp. partial sequence of the two-peptide bacteriocin revealed the product of the smbab genes recently described. we found that the peptide smbb was slightly different from the deduced sequence, and confirmed the prediction that both peptides constituting smbab bacteriocin are post-translationally modified. smbab exhibited antimicrobial activity against 11 species of streptococci, enterococcus faecalis and staphylocococcus epidermidis. taken together, the findings support the involvement of the csp response in bacteriocin production by streptococci and suggest a novel strategy to potentiate autoinducer activity.

TI  == resistance to acidic and alkaline environments in the endodontic pathogen enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == background/aims: this study aimed to investigate the biochemical mechanisms employed by the endodontic pathogen enterococcus faecalis to confer acid- and alkali-resistance and to compare these with the mechanisms of representative oral streptococci. methods: e. faecalis jcm8728, streptococcus mutans nctc10449 and streptococcus sanguinis atcc10556 were used to assess both acid- and alkali-resistance by examining: (i) growth in complex media; (ii) stability of intracellular ph (ph(in)); (iii) cell durability to leakage of preloaded bcecf (2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxy-fluorescein); and (iv) cell permeability  to sytox-green. results: growth was initiated by e. faecalis at ph 4.0-11.0, by s. mutans at ph 4.0-9.0 and by s. sanguinis at ph 5.0-9.0. the ph(in) was similar to the extracellular ph in s. mutans and s. sanguinis at ph 5-10, while the ph(in) of e. faecalis was maintained at approximately 7.5-8.5 when extracellular  ph was 7.5-10 and was maintained at levels equivalent to the extracellular ph when ph < 7.5. cell membranes of e. faecalis were resistant to bcecf leakage when extracellular ph was 2.5-12 and to sytox-green permeability at ph 4-10. the cell  membrane durability to extracellular ph in e. faecalis was higher than that observed in the streptococcus strains. conclusion: compared to s. mutans, e. faecalis was found to be equally resistant to acid and more resistant to alkalis. the results suggest that ph-resistance in e. faecalis is attributed to membrane durability against acid and alkali, in addition to cell membrane-bound proton-transport systems. these characteristics may account for why e. faecalis is frequently isolated from acidic caries lesions and from persistently infected  root canals where calcium hydroxide medication is ineffective.

TI  == the role of 16s rrna gene sequencing in identification of microorganisms misidentified by conventional methods.
AB  == traditional methods for microbial identification require the recognition of differences in morphology, growth, enzymatic activity, and metabolism to define genera and species. full and partial 16s rrna gene sequencing methods have emerged as useful tools for identifying phenotypically aberrant microorganisms. we report on three bacterial blood isolates from three different college of american pathologists-certified laboratories that were referred to arup laboratories for definitive identification. because phenotypic identification suggested unusual organisms not typically associated with the submitted clinical  diagnosis, consultation with the medical director was sought and further testing  was performed including partial 16s rrna gene sequencing. all three patients had  endocarditis, and conventional methods identified isolates from patients a, b, and c as a facklamia sp., eubacterium tenue, and a bifidobacterium sp. 16s rrna gene sequencing identified the isolates as enterococcus faecalis, cardiobacterium valvarum, and streptococcus mutans, respectively. we conclude that the initial identifications of these three isolates were erroneous, may have misled clinicians, and potentially impacted patient care. 16s rrna gene sequencing is a  more objective identification tool, unaffected by phenotypic variation or technologist bias, and has the potential to reduce laboratory errors.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and tightness of a dcpd-cao-based hydraulic calcium phosphate cement for root canal filling.
AB  == calcium hydroxide is currently used in dentistry for endodontic treatments where  its main advantage is its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity. however,  it also has some drawbacks such as pulp necrosis, slight solubility, slow and insufficient hardening, and retraction on drying. in consequence, it is used only as temporary material for root canal disinfection. by mixing calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (cahpo4 . 2h2o, also called dicalcium phosphate dihydrate, dcpd) and calcium oxide with a sodium phosphate buffer as liquid phase, we obtained a cpc with better mechanical properties than calcium hydroxide pastes. the setting reaction produced either hydroxyapatite (ha) or a mixture of ha and calcium hydroxide depending on the relative masses of dcpd and cao in the cement  powder. the presence of calcium hydroxide a priori confers antimicrobial properties to this cement which were investigated in agar plates (diffusion method) against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus hominis (clinical isolates), and  a preparation of polymicrobial flora isolated from dental plaque. the cement samples tested were prepared at molar calcium-to-phosphate ratios (ca/p) of 1.67  to 2.75. a pure calcium hydroxide paste was used as reference material. clear and reproducible bacterial growth inhibition was observed for cement samples with ca/p > or = 2 against all the microorganisms tested. with ca/p = 2.5, this cement alkalinizes dentinal tubules and provides a fluid-tight sealing that well compares with sealing obtained using a zinc oxide-eugenol cement without gutta-percha point. dcpd-cao-based cement is therefore a potential root canal filler.

AB  == prevalence of seven tetracycline resistance (tc(r)) genes--tet(l), tet(m), tet(k), tet(o), tet(s), tet(t), and tet(u)--which are known to be distributed to  gram-positive cocci was analyzed for 224 enterococcus faecalis and 46 enterococcus faecium clinical isolates obtained in a japanese hospital. any of the tc(r) genes was detected in 75.9% of all the enterococcal strains. the tet(m) was detected at highest rates in both e. faecalis (75.0%) and e. faecium (69.6%), followed by tet(l), which was harbored in 6.7% of e. faecalis isolates and 30.4%  of e. faecium isolates. the tet(o), tet(s), and tet(t) were detected in e. faecalis at low frequencies mostly associated with tet(m), while tet(k) and tet(u) were not detected. nucleotide sequences of tet(s) from e. faecalis strains were identical to that reported in listeria monocytogenes. sequences of tet(o) from two e. faecalis strains were almost identical to each other and also to those from streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus mutans, campylobacter jejuni, and campylobacter coli, although minor sequence divergence was observed. the tet(t), which had been reported only in streptococcus pyogenes, was found in five e. faecalis strains. sequence of the enterococcal tet(t) differed from that of s. pyogenes by only four nucleotides (four amino acids) and showed high sequence identity (99.8%, amino acid level). enterococcal strains with any one tc(r) gene or those with two tc(r) genes showed generally similar mics of tetracyclines, and no evident difference in resistance  level was observed.

TI  == chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of four different anatolian propolis samples.
AB  == propolis means a gum that is gathered by bees from various plants. it is known for its biological properties, having antibacterial, antifungal and healing properties. the aims of this study were to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of four different anatolian propolis samples on different groups of microorganisms including some oral pathogens and comparison between their chemical compositions. ethanol extracts of propolis (eep) were prepared from four different anatolian propolis samples and examined whether eep inhibit the growth of the test microorganisms or not. for the antimicrobial activity assays, minimum inhibitory  concentrations (mic) were determined by using macrodilution method. the mic values of the most effective propolis (tb) were 2 microg/ml for streptococcus sobrinus and enterococcus faecalis, 4 microg/ml for micrococcus luteus, candida albicans and c. krusei, 8 microg/ml for streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterobacter aerogenes, 16 microg/ml for escherichia coli and c. tropicalis and 32 microg/ml for salmonella typhimurium and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the chemical compositions of eep's were determined by high-temperature high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. the main compounds of four anatolian propolis samples were flavonoids such as pinocembrin, pinostropin, isalpinin, pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine and chrysin. although propolis samples were collected from different regions of anatolia all showed significant antimicrobial activity against the gram positive bacteria and yeasts. propolis can prevent dental caries since it demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms such as streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus and c. albicans, which involves in oral diseases.

TI  == antibacterial screening of anthocyanic and proanthocyanic fractions from cranberry juice.
AB  == the effect of anthocyanin- and proanthocyanidin-rich fractions isolated from cranberry juice was studied for their antibacterial activity against nine bacterial strains. activity was assessed by the agar diffusion assay. staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538 was the only strain to exhibit some susceptibility to four out of 10 anthocyanin-rich fractions tested. a variable susceptibility of s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis atcc 10541, and micrococcus luteus atcc 9341 to proanthocyanidin- rich fractions was also observed. streptococcus mutans strains as well as escherichia coli atcc 10538 and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 were not susceptible to any of the cranberry juice samples or fractions at the tested concentrations. there was no clear correlation between gram-positive or gram-negative bacterial susceptibility to cranberry juice. in this work, the role of cranberry juice anthocyanic and proanthocyanic fractions upon bacterial viability is discussed.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of ozonated water on bacteria invading dentinal tubules.
AB  == ozone is known to act as a strong antimicrobial agent against bacteria, fungi, and viruses. in the present study, we examined the effect of ozonated water against enterococcus faecalis and streptcoccus mutans infections in vitro in bovine dentin. after irrigation with ozonated water, the viability of e. faecalis and s. mutans invading dentinal tubules significantly decreased. notably, when the specimen was irrigated with sonication, ozonated water had nearly the same antimicrobial activity as 2.5% sodium hypochlorite (naocl). we also compared the  cytotoxicity against l-929 mouse fibroblasts between ozonated water and naocl. the metabolic activity of fibroblasts was high when the cells were treated with ozonated water, whereas that of fibroblasts significantly decreased when the cells were treated with 2.5% naocl. these results suggest that ozonated water application may be useful for endodontic therapy.

TI  == retrieving sequences of enzymes experimentally characterized but erroneously annotated : the case of the putrescine carbamoyltransferase.
AB  == background: annotating genomes remains an hazardous task. mistakes or gaps in such a complex process may occur when relevant knowledge is ignored, whether lost, forgotten or overlooked. this paper exemplifies an approach which could help to resuscitate such meaningful data. results: we show that a set of closely  related sequences which have been annotated as ornithine carbamoyltransferases are actually putrescine carbamoyltransferases. this demonstration is based on the following points : (i) use of enzymatic data which had been overlooked, (ii) rediscovery of a short nh2-terminal sequence allowing to reannotate a wrongly annotated ornithine carbamoyltransferase as a putrescine carbamoyltransferase, (iii) identification of conserved motifs allowing to distinguish unambiguously between the two kinds of carbamoyltransferases, and (iv) comparative study of the gene context of these different sequences. conclusions: we explain why this specific case of misannotation had not yet been described and draw attention to the fact that analogous instances must be rather frequent. we urge to be especially cautious when high sequence similarity is coupled with an apparent lack of biochemical information. moreover, from the point of view of genome annotation, proteins which have been studied experimentally but are not correlated with sequence data in current databases qualify as "orphans", just as  unassigned genomic open reading frames do. the strategy we used in this paper to  bridge such gaps in knowledge could work whenever it is possible to collect a body of facts about experimental data, homology, unnoticed sequence data, and accurate informations about gene context.

TI  == an evaluation of microbial leakage in roots filled with a thermoplastic synthetic polymer-based root canal filling material (resilon).
AB  == the purpose of this study was to compare bacterial leakage using streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis through gutta-percha and a thermoplastic synthetic polymer-based root filling (resilon) using two filling techniques during a 30-day period. teeth were decoronated, roots prepared to a length of 16  mm, and instrumented to iso sizes 40 to 50. a total of 156 roots were randomly divided into 8 groups of 15 roots (groups 1-8) and 3 control groups (12 roots each). roots were filled using lateral and vertical condensation techniques with  gutta-percha and ah 26 sealer (groups 1 and 2) or with gutta-percha and epiphany  sealer (groups 3 and 4). groups 5 and 6 were filled with resilon and epiphany sealer using the lateral or vertical condensation techniques. a split chamber microbial leakage model was used in which s. mutans placed in the upper chamber could reach the lower chamber only through the filled canal. groups 7 and 8 were  identical to groups 5 and 6 respectively; however, e. faecalis was used to test the leakage. positive controls were filled with resilon (12 roots) and gutta-percha (12 roots) without sealer and tested with bacteria, whereas negative controls (12 roots) were sealed with wax to test the seal between chambers. all but one positive control leaked within 24 h, whereas none of the negative controls leaked. resilon showed minimal leakage (group 8: one leakage; groups 5-7: each with two leakages), which was significantly less than gutta-percha, in  which approximately 80% of specimens with either technique or sealer leaked. kruskal-wallis test showed statistical significance when all groups were compared (p < 0.05). mann-whitney u test compared the respective groups and found resilon  groups superior to gutta-percha groups (p < 0.05).

TI  == preliminary evaluation of bioactive glass s53p4 as an endodontic medication in vitro.
AB  == calcium hydroxide is the "gold standard" endodontic medication, but it may fail to eliminate certain facultative bacteria and yeasts found in root canal systems. in this study, standardized bovine dentin blocks infected with enterococcus faecalis were treated with an aqueous calcium hydroxide or bioactive glass s53p4  (bag) powder suspension. while calcium hydroxide was ineffective, the bag suspension eliminated the infection in the sampled dentin layers after 5 days. in a direct exposure test, preincubation with human dentin boosted the bag-killing efficacy against e. faecalis atcc29212, candida albicans ccug19915, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc9027, streptococcus sanguis atcc10556, and s. mutans atcc25175. bag placed in the root canals of extracted teeth did not alter root-dentin ph. consequently, the conditions under which the microbiota were killed were not ph-mediated. further studies are ongoing to help clarify the antimicrobial bag effect in the presence of dentin.

TI  == cell density--dependent regulation: basic principles and effects on the virulence of gram-positive cocci.
AB  == principles: quorum sensing (qs) regulation appears to be a consequence of interbacterial communication by which bacteria of one or even different species learn about their current population density and react in a defined way to that information. qs-regulation is a three step process: in the first step specific signaling molecules are produced and secreted to the exterior space. in the second step, the molecules accumulate e.g. with growing population density. in the last step, a supra-threshold concentration of the molecules is extra- or intra-cellularly sensed by the bacteria and leads to a cascade of regulatory activities. while gram-negative bacteria can employ five or more different chemical classes of signaling molecules, gram-positive cocci predominantly use special oligopeptides for specific signaling. descriptions: examples of qs-regulatory effects on virulence factor expression in staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, and enterococcus faecalis are given. in these bacteria, qs-regulation appears to be crucial for displaying tissue invasiveness and/or biofilm formation. applications: the high specificity of the initial signal sensing and the importance for expressing special virulence traits make this type of gene expression control a promising target for the development of novel therapeutics. the options for such therapies are critically discussed based on practical experiences with interference in s. aureus qs-regulation.

AB  == we used broad-range eubacterial pcr amplification followed by direct sequencing to identify microbial pathogens in heart valve material from 29 patients with histologically confirmed infective endocarditis and 23 patients free of infective endocarditis. microorganisms cultured by conventional techniques matched those identified by pcr in 21 cases. pcr alone identified the causative agent in three  cases (streptococcus bovis, staphylococcus cohnii, and coxiella burnetii), allowing better patient management. pcr corrected the initial bacteriological diagnosis in three cases (streptococcus bovis, streptococcus mutans, and bartonella henselae). among the 29 cases of histologically confirmed infective endocarditis, pcr findings were positive in 27 cases and were consistent with the bacterial morphology seen at gram staining (26 cases) or with the results obtained by immunohistologic analysis with an anti-c. burnetii monoclonal antibody (one case). in two other cases of histologically confirmed infective endocarditis, pcr remained negative in a blood culture-negative case for which no bacteria were seen at histological analysis and in one case with visualization of cocci and blood cultures positive for enterococcus faecalis. ten clinical diagnoses of possible infective endocarditis were ruled out by histopathological  analysis of the valves and subsequently by pcr. pcr was negative in 13 of the 14  patients in whom infective endocarditis was rejected on clinical grounds; the other patient was found to have coxiella burnetii infective endocarditis on the basis of pcr and histopathological analysis and was subsequently included in the  group of 29 definite cases. in total, pcr contributed to the diagnosis and management of infective endocarditis in 6 of 29 (20%) cases.

TI  == the icest1 element of streptococcus thermophilus belongs to a large family of integrative and conjugative elements that exchange modules and change their specificity of integration.
AB  == the 34,734-bp element icest1 from streptococcus thermophilus cnrz368 is site-specifically integrated into the 3(') end of the gene fda. icest1 encodes integrative functions and putative transfer functions. six proteins of the putative conjugative system of icest1 are related to those encoded by the conjugative transposon tn916 from enterococcus faecalis. a comparison of these proteins with those encoded by the complete or partial genome sequences of various low g+c bacteria including bacillus subtilis, clostridium difficile, e. faecalis, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus mutans revealed the presence of numerous putative site-specific integrative conjugative  elements and/or conjugative transposons within these genomes. sequence comparisons revealed that these elements possess a modular structure and that exchanges of unrelated or distantly related modules and genes have occurred between these elements, and also plasmids and prophages. these exchanges have probably led to modifications in the site specificity of integration of these elements. therefore, a distinction between low specificity integrative conjugative elements (i.e., conjugative transposons) and site-specific integrative conjugative elements does not appear to be relevant. we propose to call all the conjugative elements that excise by site-specific recombination and  integrate by recombination between a specific site of a circular intermediate and another site, "integrative and conjugative elements" (ices), irrespective of the  integration specificity.

TI  == the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase motif is lacking in pmpa, the prsa-like protein involved in the secretion machinery of lactococcus lactis.
AB  == the prsa-like gene from lactococcus lactis encoding its single homologue to prsa, an essential protein triggering the folding of secreted proteins in bacillus subtilis, was characterized. this gene, annotated pmpa, encodes a lipoprotein of  309 residues whose expression is increased 7- to 10-fold when the source of nitrogen is limited. a slight increase in the expression of the prsa-like protein (plp) in l. lactis removed the degradation products previously observed with the  staphylococcus hyicus lipase used as a model secreted protein. this shows that pmpa either triggers the folding of the secreted lipase or activates its degradation by the cell surface protease htra. unlike the case for b. subtilis, the inactivation of the gene encoding pmpa reduced only slightly the growth rate  of l. lactis in standard conditions. however, it almost stopped its growth when the lipase was overexpressed in the presence of salt in the medium. like prsa of  b. subtilis and prtm of l. lactis, the l. lactis pmpa protein could thus have a foldase activity that facilitates protein secretion. these proteins belong to the third family of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerases (ppiases) for which parvulin is the prototype. almost all plp from gram-positive bacteria contain a domain with the ppiase signature. an exception to this situation was found only in streptococcaceae, the family to which l. lactis belongs. plp from streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis possess this signature, but those of l. lactis, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus mutans do not. however, secondary structure predictions suggest that the folding of plp is conserved over the entire length of the proteins, including the unconserved signature region. the activity associated with the expression of pmpa in l. lactis and these genomic data show that either the ppiase motif is not necessary for ppiase activity or, more likely, pmpa foldase activity does not necessarily require ppiase activity.

TI  == role of the streptococcus gordonii sspb protein in the development of porphyromonas gingivalis biofilms on streptococcal substrates.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is an aggressive periodontal pathogen that persists in the mixed-species plaque biofilm on tooth surfaces. p. gingivalis cells attach to the plaque commensal streptococcus gordonii and this coadhesion event leads to the development of p. gingivalis biofilms. binding of these organisms is multimodal, involving both the p. gingivalis major fimbrial fima protein and the  species-specific interaction of the minor fimbrial mfa1 protein with the streptococcal sspb protein. this study examined the contribution of the mfa1-sspb interaction to p. gingivalis biofilm formation. p. gingivalis biofilms readily formed on substrata of s. gordonii dl1 but not on streptococcus mutans cells which lack a coadhesion-mediating homologue of sspb. an insertional inactivation  of the mfa1 gene in p. gingivalis resulted in a phenotype deficient in s. gordonii binding and unable to form biofilms. furthermore, analysis using recombinant streptococci and enterococci showed that p. gingivalis biofilms formed on enterococcus faecalis strains expressing sspb or translational fusions  of sspb with spap (the non-adherent sspb homologue in s. mutans) containing the p. gingivalis adherence domain (sspb adherence region, bar) of sspb. in contrast, an isogenic ssp null mutant of s. gordonii dl1 was unable to support biofilm growth, even though this strain bound to p. gingivalis fima at levels similar to  wild-type s. gordonii dl1. finally, site-specific mutation of two functional amino acid residues in bar resulted in sspb polypeptides that did not promote the development of p. gingivalis biofilms. these results suggest that the induction of p. gingivalis biofilms on a streptococcal substrate requires functional sspb-minor fimbriae interactions.

TI  == discrete protein determinant directs the species-specific adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis to oral streptococci.
AB  == for pathogens to survive in the human oral cavity, they must identify a suitable  niche in the complex multispecies biofilm that exists on oral tissues. the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis adheres to streptococcus gordonii by interacting with a specific region of the streptococcal sspb polypeptide, designated bar. however, it does not adhere to streptococcus mutans, which expresses spap, a highly conserved homolog of sspb. comparison of the predicted secondary structure of bar with the corresponding region of spap suggested that the substitution of asn for gly1182 and val for pro1185 in sspb may confer a unique local structure that is not conserved in spap. a synthetic peptide of 26 amino acids that encompassed residues 1167 to 1193 of sspb promoted avid adherence of p. gingivalis, whereas a peptide derived from the region corresponding to bar in spap was inactive. substitution of gly1182 and pro1185 for asn1182 and val1185 in sspb by site-specific mutation generated proteins that were predicted to assume an spap-like secondary structure, and the purified proteins did not promote p. gingivalis adherence. furthermore, enterococcus faecalis strains expressing the site-specific mutants did not support adherence of p. gingivalis cells. in contrast, p. gingivalis adhered efficiently to e. faecalis strains expressing intact sspb or sspb-spap chimeric proteins containing bar. these results suggest that a region of sspb consisting of 26 amino acids is  sufficient to mediate the adherence of p. gingivalis to s. gordonii and that the  species specificity of adherence arises from its interaction with a discrete structural determinant of sspb that is not conserved in spap.

TI  == conserved degp protease in gram-positive bacteria is essential for thermal and oxidative tolerance and full virulence in streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the degp protease, a multifunctional chaperone and protease, has been shown to be essential for virulence in gram-negative pathogens such as salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, brucella abortus, yersinia enterocolitica, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the function of degp in pathogenesis appears to be the degradation of damaged proteins that accumulate as a result of the initial host response to infection, which includes the release of reactive oxygen intermediates. additionally, the degp protease plays a major role in monitoring and maintaining  the escherichia coli periplasm and influences e. coli pilus biogenesis. we report here the identification of highly homologous enzymes in streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the phenotype of an insertionally inactivated degp allele in s. pyogenes is similar to that reported for e. coli, with temperature sensitivity for growth and enhanced sensitivity to reactive oxygen intermediates. virulence studies in a mouse model of streptococcal infection indicate that a functional degp protease is required for full virulence. these results suggest degp as an attractive broad-spectrum target for future anti-infective drug development.

AB  == the antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of sodium hypochlorite (naocl) and sodium dichloroisocyanurate (nadcc) were evaluated and compared in vitro. the minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration of naocl and nadcc were tested for streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus salivarius, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus mutans. the cytotoxic effect was assessed by using human fibroblast tissue culture. survival rate was assessed by  a protein determination method. results showed that the minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration values of naocl and nadcc for the tested bacteria were in a similar range. nadcc in concentrations higher than 0.02%, and naocl in concentrations higher than 0.01% were lethal to fibroblasts. in conclusion it seems that both agents were very effective in killing bacteria, and their cytotoxicity to fibroblasts in tissue culture was similar.

TI  == enterococcus faecalis--a mechanism for its role in endodontic failure.
AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to identify a possible mechanism that would explain how e. faecalis could survive and grow within dentinal tubules and reinfect an obturated root canal. methodology: cells of streptococcus gordonii dl1, streptococcus mutans ng8, or e. faecalis jh2-2 were grown in brain heart infusion broth containing various amounts of human serum for 56 days. the ability of the three species to invade dentine and bind to immobilized type i collagen in the presence of human serum was assessed by dentine invasion and microtitre well  experiments. results: all three species remained viable over the period of the experiment when grown in human serum. cells of all three bacteria were able to invade dentine and bind to immobilized collagen. both of these properties were inhibited by the presence of collagen in the cell solution. human serum inhibited dentine invasion and collagen adhesion by s. gordonii dl1 and s. mutans ng8, whilst dentine invasion by e. faecalis jh2-2 was reduced in the presence of serum, but not inhibited, and binding to collagen was enhanced. conclusions: it is postulated that a virulence factor of e. faecalis in failed endodontically treated teeth may be related to the ability of e. faecalis cells to maintain the  capability to invade dentinal tubules and adhere to collagen in the presence of human serum.

TI  == control of microorganisms in vitro by calcium hydroxide pastes.
AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to determine the influence of vehicles on the antimicrobial efficiency of calcium hydroxide. methodology: a total of 588 size 50 sterile absorbent paper points, were immersed in various microbial suspensions for 3 min. the points were then placed on petri dishes and covered with intracanal dressings containing calcium hydroxide: ca(oh)2 + saline; ca(oh)2 + camphorated paramonochlorophenol; ca(oh)2 + 1% chlorhexidine solution: ca(oh)2 +  3% sodium lauryl sulphate; ca(oh)2 + otosporin. after 1 min, 48 and 72 h and 7 days, 147 absorbent paper cones were removed from contact with the intracanal dressings and individually transported and immersed in 5 ml of letheen broth, followed by incubation at 37 degrees c for 48 h. microbial growth was evaluated by turbidity of the culture medium. a 0.1-ml inoculum obtained from the letheen broth was transferred to 5 ml of bhi, and incubated at 37 degrees c for 48 h. bacterial growth was again evaluated by turbidity of the culture medium. positive bhi tubes were selected and inocula were spread on the surface of bhi agar and incubated at 37 degrees c for 48 h. gram staining of the bhi growth and from colonies growing on bhi agar was carried out. results: an antimicrobial effect occurred after 48 h on the cultures of s. mutans, e. faecalis, s. aureus, p aeruginosa, b. subtilis, c. albicans and a mixed culture, irrespective of the intracanal dressing. conclusions: under the conditions of this study, the various vehicles associated with calcium hydroxide pastes did not influence the time required for microbial inactivation.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of four root canal sealers (ah plus, sealapex, ketac endo, and fill canal), two calcium hydroxide pastes (calen and calasept), and a zinc oxide paste was evaluated. seven bacterial strains were used, six of them standard; micrococcus luteus atcc 9341, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, escherichia coli atcc 25922, and enterococcus faecalis atcc 10541. there was a wild strain of streptococcus mutans isolated from saliva obtained in an adult dental clinic. activity was evaluated using the agar diffusion method with brain  heart infusion agar and muller hinton medium seeded by pour plate. calcium hydroxide-based sealers and pastes were either placed directly into 4.0 x 4.0 mm  wells or by using absorbent paper points. the plates were kept at room temperature for 2 hr for diffusion. after incubation at 37 degrees c for 24 hr, the medium was optimized with 0.05 g% ttc gel and inhibition haloes were measured. all bacterial strains were inhibited by all materials using the well method. however, when the materials were applied with absorbent paper points, enterococcus faecalis was not inhibited by zinc oxide, and pseudomonas aeruginosa was not inhibited by ah plus, fill canal, and the zinc oxide-based paste. we conclude that sealers and pastes presented antimicrobial activity in vitro and culture medium optimization with 0.05 g% ttc gel facilitated observation of the inhibition haloes.

TI  == the gene encoding iiab(man)l in streptococcus salivarius is part of a tetracistronic operon encoding a phosphoenolpyruvate: mannose/glucose phosphotransferase system.
AB  == glucose and mannose are transported in streptococci by the mannose-pts (phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose phosphotransferase system), which consists of a cytoplasmic iiab protein, called iiab(man), and an uncharacterized membrane permease. this paper reports the characterization of the man operon encoding the  specific components of the mannose-pts of streptococcus salivarius. the man operon was composed of four genes, manl, manm, mann and mano. these genes were transcribed from a canonical promoter (pman) into a 3.6 kb polycistronic mrna that contained a 5'-utr (untranslated region). the predicted manl gene product encoded a 35.5 kda protein and contained the amino acid sequences of the iia and  iib phosphorylation sites already determined from purified s. salivarius iiab(man)l. expression of manl in escherichia coli generated a 35 kda protein that reacted with anti-iiab(man)l antibodies. the predicted manm protein had an estimated size of 27.2 kda. manm had similarity with iic domains of the mannose-eii family, but did not possess the signature proposed for mannose-iic proteins from gram-negative bacteria. from multiple alignment analyses of sequences available in current databases, the following modified iic(man) signature is proposed: gx3g[dnh]x3g[livm]2xg2[stl][lt][eq]. the deduced product of mann was a hydrophobic protein with a predicted molecular mass of 33.4 kda. the mann protein contained an amino acid sequence similar to the signature sequence of the iid domains of the mannose-eii family. mano encoded a 13.7 kda protein. this gene was also transcribed as a monocistronic mrna from a promoter located in the mann-mano intergenic region. a search of current databases revealed the presence of iiab(man)l, manm, mann and mano orthologues in streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis. this work has elucidated the molecular structure of the mannose pts in streptococci and enterococci, and demonstrated the presence of a putative regulatory protein (mano) within the man operon.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis and arnica montana against oral pathogens.
AB  == arnica and propolis have been used for thousands of years in folk medicine for several purposes. they possess several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral and tissue regenerative, among others. although the antibacterial activity of propolis has already been demonstrated, very few studies have been done on bacteria of clinical relevance in dentistry. also, the antimicrobial activity of arnica has not been extensively investigated. therefore the aim here was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial activity, inhibition of adherence of mutans streptococci and inhibition of formation of water-insoluble glucan by arnica and propolis extracts. arnica montana (10%, w/v) and propolis (10%, w/v) extracts from minas gerais state were compared with controls. fifteen microorganisms were used as follows: candida albicans--ntcc 3736, f72; staphylococcus aureus--atcc 25923; enterococcus faecalis--atcc 29212;  streptococcus sobrinus 6715; strep. sanguis--atcc 10556; strep. cricetus--hs-6; strep. mutans--ingbritt 1600; strep. mutans--omz 175; actinomyces naeslundii--atcc 12104, w 1053; act. viscosus omz 105; porphyromonas gingivalis;  porph. endodontalis and prevotella denticola (the last three were clinical isolates). antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. to assess cell adherence to a glass surface, the organisms were grown for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30  degree angle. to assay water-insoluble glucan formation, a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase and 0.125 m sucrose was incubated for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. arnica and propolis extracts (20 microl) were added to these tubes to evaluate the % of inhibition of cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation. the propolis extract significantly inhibited all the microorganisms tested (p < 0.05), showing the largest inhibitory zone for actinomyces spp. the arnica extract did not demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity. cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation were almost completely inhibited by the propolis extract at a final concentration of 400 microg/ml and 500 microg/ml, respectively. the arnica extract showed slight inhibition of the adherence of the growing cells (19% for strep. mutans and 15% for strep. sobrinus) and of water-insoluble glucan formation (29%) at these same  concentrations. thus, the propolis extract showed in vitro antibacterial activity, inhibition of cell adherence and inhibition of water-insoluble glucan formation, while the arnica extract was only slightly active in those three conditions.

TI  == the in vitro effects of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate on oral and pharyngeal microorganisms of various ecological niches.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the in vitro susceptibility to cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate for various aerobic and anaerobic micro-organisms responsible for oral and pharyngeal diseases by assessing the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations  (mbcs) or minimum fungicidal concentrations (mfcs) and by determining kill-times. the mics of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate for 46 tested strains (25 reference strains and 21 clinical isolates) ranged from 8 to 500 micrograms/ml. the mic was found to be 31.25 micrograms/ml for 36% of the reference strains. even lower mic values (15.63 micrograms/ml) were observed for some anaerobic strains, for haemophilus influenzae and for candida tropicalis. mic and mbc values corresponded for the majority of strains tested while the mfc for c. tropicalis and c. albicans was much higher. only 9.5% of the clinical isolates gave a mic value of 31.25 micrograms/ml. enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus showed mic at 62.5 micrograms/ml. the mic and  mbc values among the isolates were comparable, while the mfc value for the yeasts was greater. a concentration of 125 micrograms/ml of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate inhibited the growth of all bacteria, except enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonaceae, and yeasts. cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate shows very rapid kill-time for s. sanguis (0"), and rapid (15") for s. pyogenes, s. dysgalactiae and s. mutans and for moraxella catarrhalis, while a longer kill-time was necessary for the other microbes tested.

TI  == interspecies recombination between enterococci: genetic and phenotypic diversity  of vancomycin-resistant transconjugants.
AB  == handwerger and colleagues demonstrated that a particular clinical isolate of enterococcus faecium, designated guc, and here redesignated as gucr, can conjugatively transfer vancomycin resistance. the vancomycin resistance is encoded by a chromosomally born linked set of genes in the donor, designated the  vana cluster, to the chromosome of an e. faecalis recipient, jh2-2. here it is reported that an earlier isolate of e. faecium from the same patient who later harbored the vancomycin-resistant e. faecium gucr lacks the vana gene cluster but is otherwise similar (by smai chromosomal fingerprint and metabolic fingerprinting) to the vancomycin-resistant gucr. therefore, "gucs" is a strong suspect as the base strain for the clinical acquisition of the vana cluster present in gucr. thirteen laboratory-generated vana transconjugants derived from  conjugation between gucr and jh2-2 were subjected to further analysis, allowing a comparison between transfer in the laboratory and transfer that occurred in the clinical setting. surprisingly, each jh2-2 transconjugant had a unique constellation of abilities to oxidize various members of a panel of potential carbon sources. this pattern was stable for each transconjugant, and it was not changed by growing the strains with or without vancomycin. transconjugants had pulsed-field gel electrophoretic (pfge) patterns largely consistent with that of  jh2-2, the recipient in conjugation experiments. however, pfge analysis showed that a large but variable amount of dna, between 145 kb and 277 kb, was transferred into different transconjugants. the mechanism appears to be conjugative transposition in which new dna is added to the pre-existing genome rather than substituting for a segment in the recipient. mapping and hybridization studies of several transconjugants showed that each received similar, but not exactly the same, dna fragment of at least 30 kb from the donor. sequencing of 16s ribosomal genes was used to confirm that the recipient and donor strains used in transconjugation experiments were different species. sequence analysis was also used to consider the possibility that rrna operons might be mobilized in conjugation, but no evidence for the transfer of rdna operons was found. an apparent insertion sequence in e. faecium almost identical  to is 1485 and 57% sequence identity to is 199 of streptococcus mutans was found  in the region of dna transferred. the results imply new consequences of conjugative transfer and interspecies recombination.

TI  == lacticin 3147 displays activity in buffer against gram-positive bacterial pathogens which appear insensitive in standard plate assays.
AB  == lacticin 3147 is a broad-spectrum bacteriocin produced by lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis dpc3147, which has been shown to be active against a range of food-borne bacteria. the reported inhibitory range for lacticin is extended to include methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, penicillin-resistant pneumococcus, propionibacterium acne  and streptococcus mutans. this extended host range is not obvious from traditional agar plate-based methods, but reductions in bacterial cell numbers by up to 6 log10 cfu ml-1 was observed after 2 h in time-kill curve studies conducted in broth, suggesting that the bacteriocin may have potential as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of human infections.

TI  == humoral immunity to commensal oral bacteria in human infants: salivary secretory  immunoglobulin a antibodies reactive with streptococcus mitis biovar 1, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans, and enterococcus faecalis during the  first two years of life.
AB  == secretory immunoglobulin a (siga) antibodies reactive with the pioneer oral streptococci streptococcus mitis biovar 1 and streptococcus oralis, the late oral colonizer streptococcus mutans, and the pioneer enteric bacterium enterococcus faecalis in saliva samples from 10 human infants from birth to age 2 years were analyzed. low levels of salivary siga1 and siga2 antibodies reactive with whole cells of all four species were detected within the first month after birth, even  though s. mutans and e. faecalis were not recovered from the mouths of the infants during the study period. although there was a fivefold increase in the concentration of siga between birth and age 2 years, there were no differences between the concentrations of siga1 and siga2 antibodies reactive with the four species over this time period. when the concentrations of siga1 and siga2 antibodies reactive with all four species were normalized to the concentrations of siga1 and siga2 in saliva, siga1 and siga2 antibodies reactive with these bacteria showed a significant decrease from birth to 2 years of age. adsorption of each infant's saliva with cells of one species produced a dramatic reduction of antibodies recognizing the other three species. sequential adsorption of saliva samples removed all siga antibody to the bacteria, indicating that the siga antibodies were directed to antigens shared by all four species. the induction by the host of a limited immune response to common antigens that are likely not involved in adherence may be among the mechanisms that commensal streptococci employ to persist in the oral cavity.

TI  == import and metabolism of glutathione by streptococcus mutans.
AB  == glutathione (gamma-glucysgly, gsh) is not found in most gram-positive bacteria, but some appear to synthesize it and others, including streptococcus mutans atcc  33402, import it from their growth medium. import of oxidized glutathione (gssg)  by s. mutans 33402 in 7h9 medium was shown to require glucose and to occur with an apparent km of 18+/-5 microm. gssg, gsh, s-methylglutathione, and homocysteine-glutathione mixed disulfide (hcyssg) were imported at comparable rates (measured by depletion of substrate in the medium), as was the disulfide of gamma-glucys. in contrast, the disulfide of cysgly was not taken up at a measurable rate, indicating that the gamma-glu residue is important for efficient transport. during incubation with gssg, little gssg was detected in cells but gsh and gamma-glucys accumulated during the first 30 min and then declined. no significant intracellular accumulation of cys or sulfide was found. transient intracellular accumulation of d/l-homocysteine, as well as gsh and gamma-glucys,  was observed during import of hcyssg. although substantial levels of gsh were found in cells when s. mutans was grown on media containing glutathione, such gsh accumulation had no effect on the growth rate. however, the presence of cellular  gsh did protect against growth inhibition by the thiol-oxidizing agent diamide. import of glutathione by s. mutans atcc 25175, which like strain 33402 does not synthesize glutathione, occurred at a rate comparable to that of strain 33402, but three species which appear to synthesize glutathione (s. agalactiae atcc 12927, s. pyogenes atcc 8668, and enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212) imported glutathione at negligible or markedly lower rates.

TI  == acid tolerance response and survival by oral bacteria.
AB  == using 21 species of oral bacteria, representing six acidogenic genera, we undertook to determine whether the ph-limiting exponential growth is related to the ability of the organisms to generate an acid-tolerance response that results  in enhanced survival at low ph. the lower ph limit of exponential growth varied by more than two units with that of neisseria a182 at ph 6.34; growth of lactobacillus casei rb1014 stopped at ph 3.81, with species of actinomyces, enterococcus, prevotella and streptococcus falling between these limits. the working hypothesis was that the organisms with the higher ph limits for growth are unable to respond to acidic environments in order to survive, whereas the more aciduric organisms would possess or acquire acid tolerance. adaptation to acid tolerance was tested by determining whether the prior exposure of exponential-phase cells to a low, sub-lethal ph would trigger the induction of a  mechanism that would enhance survival at a ph killing ph 7.5 control cells. the killing ph varied from ph 4.5 for prevotella intermedia atcc 25611 to ph 2.3 for  the three lactobacillus casei strains in the study, with the three streptococcus  mutans strains killed at ph 3.0 for 3 h. the adaptation experiments revealed three groups of organisms: non-acid-responders, generally representing strains with the highest terminal ph values; weak acid-responders in the middle of the ph list, generating low numbers of survivors at one or two ph values, and the aciduric, strong responders generating a high number of survivors at ph values in the range 6.0 to 3.5, but not at ph 7.5. predominant among the latter group were  the s. mutans and lactobacilli casei strains, with the most significant adaptive  response exhibited by s. mutans lt11 and s. mutans ingbritt, involving a process  that required protein synthesis. time course experiments with the latter organisms indicated that 90-120 min was required after exposure to the triggering ph before the acid response was fully functional. these results indicate that the sudden exposure of strains of oral streptococci and lactobacilli, as well as enterococcus faecalis, to ph values between 6.0 and 3.5 results in the induction  of an acid tolerance response that enhances the survival of these strains at or below ph 3.5.

TI  == inducer expulsion and the occurrence of an hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-phosphate phosphatase in enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == inducer expulsion, a phenomenon in which rapidly metabolizable sugars cause cytoplasmic dephosphorylation and efflux of pre-accumulated sugar-phosphates (sugar-p), has been documented for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus bovis, and lactococcus lactis, but not for other gram-positive bacteria. using intact cells and membrane vesicles, we show that enterococcus faecalis exhibits both inducer exclusion and inducer expulsion, and that the latter phenomenon is dependent on the metabolite-activated atp-dependent hpr(ser) kinase that phosphorylates ser-46 in hpr of the phosphotransferase system. a small, heat-stable, membrane-associated, hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-p phosphatase (pase  ii), previously identified only in lc. lactis, is shown to be present in extracts of enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes but not in those of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, or bacillis subtilis, organisms that do not exhibit the inducer expulsion phenomenon. further, lactobacillus brevis, an organism that exhibits inducer expulsion by a different mechanism, also apparently lacks pase ii. the results reveal that pase ii is present in those organisms that exhibit the coupled sugar-p hydrolysis/expulsion mechanism but not those that lack this mechanism. they provide correlative evidence that pase ii initiates inducer expulsion in species of enterococci, streptococci and lactococci.

TI  == role of the c terminus in antigen p1 surface localization in streptococcus mutans and two related cocci.
AB  == the c terminus of the major surface protein p1 from streptococcus mutans is composed of a hydrophilic domain, an lpntgv motif, a hydrophobic domain, and a charged tail. these features are shared by surface proteins from many gram-positive coccal bacteria. to investigate the role of the c-terminal domains  in antigen p1 surface localization, full-length and truncated p1 gene constructs, which were expressed on the shuttle vector pdl276, were transformed into the p1-negative mutant s. mutans sm3352, streptococcus gordonii dl-1, and enterococcus faecalis uv202. transformants were tested for expression of p1 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assaying and western blotting. the results showed that full-length p1 was expressed by transformants of all three bacteria and was  localized on the cell surface. a fusion protein composed of the staphylococcus aureus fibronectin binding protein c terminus and the p1 protein n terminus was found to surface localize in s. mutans. deletion of the entire c-terminal domains resulted in p1 being expressed in the culture supernatant. a p1 truncation, which carried only the hydrophilic domain at its c terminus, was found partially associated with the cell surface. this truncated p1 was readily removed from the  isolated cell wall by hot sodium dodecyl sulfate-mercaptoethanol extraction. in contrast, the full-length p1 remained associated with the isolated cell wall after similar treatment, suggesting covalent linkages between the full-length p1  and the cell wall. the results described above showed that antigen p1 was anchored to the cell wall by its c-terminal domains probably via covalent linkages with the cell wall. the results also support a universal mechanism involving the c-terminal domains for protein surface localization among this group of gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == molecular cloning and sequence analysis of the gene encoding the h2o-forming nadh oxidase from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == to discover the molecular properties of two distinct nadh oxidases, corresponding to h2o2-forming oxidase (nox-1) and h2o-forming oxidase (nox-2) induced in streptococcus mutans, for the first step we had cloned and sequenced the nox-1 gene encoding nox-1. in this paper, a nox-2 gene encoding nox-2 from s. mutans was cloned, and the nucleotides sequenced. the nox-2 gene comprises 1371 base-pairs, encoding a polypeptide of 457 amino acid residues. the deduced relative molecular mass (m(r) = 49919) agreed with the previous value obtained from the purified nox-2 protein. the nox-2 gene was expressed in escherichia coli using its own promoter. alignment of the nox-2 protein sequence with that of the  nox-1 showed that the proteins do not significantly resemble each other. comparisons with the nadh oxidase from streptococcus faecalis 10c1 yield identities of 41%. the redox-active cysteine in the enzyme from s. faecalis was found to correspond to cys 44 in the nox-2.

TI  == characterization of superoxide dismutase genes from gram-positive bacteria by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers.
AB  == an internal fragment representing approximately 85% of sod genes from seven gram-positive bacteria was amplified by using degenerate primers in a polymerase  chain reaction assay. the dna sequences of sod polymerase chain reaction products from clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactococcus lactis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes were determined. comparisons of their deduced amino acid sequences with those of the corresponding regions of  the sod proteins from bacillus stearothermophilus, listeria monocytogenes, and streptococcus mutans revealed strong relatedness. phylogenetic analysis of sod peptides showed that members of the genera streptococcus and those of the genera  enterococcus constitute two well-supported monophyletic groups. the method described in this study provides a means for easy recovery of sod genes and the construction of sod mutants of various gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == molecular cloning and sequence analysis of the gene encoding the h2o2-forming nadh oxidase from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == streptococcus mutans induces both h2o2-forming and h2o-forming nadh oxidases in the presence of o2 [m. higuchi, j. gen. microbiol., 130, 1819-1826 (1984)]. in this paper, a nox-1 gene encoding h2o2-forming nadh oxidase (nox-1) from streptococcus mutans was cloned, and the nucleotides sequenced. the structural gene of nox-1 consisted of 1530 base pairs, which encode a polypeptide consisting of 510 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 55,196 da. the deduced n-terminal amino acid sequence was consistent with that previously found for the  purified nox-1 protein. the nox-1 gene was expressed in escherichia coli using its own promoter. alignment of the amino acid sequence of nox-1 with those of nadh oxidases from other microorganisms showed identities of 55.6%, 20.8%, 20.3%, and 7.3% for those of amphibacillus xylanus ep01, streptococcus faecalis 10c1, thermoanaerobium brockii rt8.g4, and thermus thermophilus hb8, respectively.

TI  == an in vitro investigation of the cariogenic potential of oral streptococci.
AB  == whilst the importance of the mutans streptococci in the aetiology of dental caries is clear, a number of studies have described caries development in their absence. this investigation aimed to assess the cariogenic potential of streptococcus gordonii, strep. sanguis, strep. vestibularis and enterococcus faecalis in comparison with strep. mutans and strep. sobrinus, using a recently described in vitro model. in the presence of a 146 mm sucrose solution and powdered hydroxyapatite, each species was incubated for 5 h, after which acid anion production, calcium release and change in ph were measured. it was possible to assign each species to one of three groups, with e. faecalis, strep. gordonii, strep. sanguis exhibiting low, strep. vestibularis intermediate, and strep. mutans and strep. sobrinus high in vitro cariogenic potential. this assay could be used as a screening test to assess the potential cariogenicity of a range of bacterial species.

TI  == molecules of streptococcus gordonii that bind to porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == interbacterial binding is considered an important colonization mechanism for many of the organisms that inhabit dental plaque. porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontal pathogen, can adhere to species that comprise early plaque, such as streptococcus gordonii. in this study, the molecules of s. gordonii g9b that mediate binding to p. gingivalis were investigated. biotinylated surface molecules of s. gordonii were extracted and mixed with p. gingivalis cells. interactive streptococcal components were identified by sds-page of the p. gingivalis cells followed by electroblotting, and visualization of the adsorbed streptococcal molecules with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase. s. gordonii molecules of 45 kda and a doublet of 62/60 kda were observed to bind to p. gingivalis. polyclonal antibodies raised to the 62/60 kda proteins inhibited the  binding interaction. these antibodies demonstrated an antigenic relationship between the 62/60 kda molecules and the 45 kda protein. both molecules were also  antigenically related to, and may be breakdown products of, a larger molecule of  170 kda which is antigenically related to the p1 antigen of s. mutans. cloning and expression in enterococcus faecalis of the gene for the p1-like molecule from s. gordonii m5 resulted in a phenotype that expressed the 62/60 kda and 45 kda antigens and was capable of binding to p. gingivalis. these results suggest that  a p1-like molecule in s. gordonii is involved in adherence to p. gingivalis. processing of the p1-like molecule into smaller fragments of 62/60 kda and 45 kda may be required for binding activity.

TI  == the cell-bound fructosyltransferase of streptococcus salivarius: the carboxyl terminus specifies attachment in a streptococcus gordonii model system.
AB  == the ftf gene, coding for the cell-bound beta-d-fructosyltransferase (ftf) of streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975, has been analyzed, and its deduced amino acid sequence has been compared with that of the secreted ftf of streptococcus mutans and the levansucrases (sacbs) of bacillus species. a unique proline-rich region detected at the c terminus of the ftf of s. salivarius preceded a hydrophobic terminal domain. this proline-rich region was shown to possess strong homology to the product of the prgc gene from pcf10 in enterococcus faecalis, which encodes a pheromone-responsive protein of unknown function, as well as homology to the human proline-rich salivary protein prp-4. a series of 3'-oh deletions of the s. salivarius ftf gene expressed in streptococcus gordonii challis lgr2 showed that the c terminus was required for cell surface attachment  in this heterologous organism, as only the complete gene product was cell bound.  this cell-bound activity was released in the presence of sucrose, suggesting that the mode of attachment and release of the s. salivarius ftf in s. gordonii was similar to that in its native host.

TI  == antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin b, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the n-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  == a physiologically diverse range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin b, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. the list of susceptible organisms includes escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, corynebacterium diphtheriae, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens.  concentrations of lactoferricin b required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and  the culture medium used. the peptide showed activity against e. coli o111 over the range of ph 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of na+, k+, mg2+ or ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. lactoferricin  b was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. pseudomonas fluorescens, enterococcus faecalis and bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.

TI  == isolation, characterization, and nucleotide sequence of the streptococcus mutans  mannitol-phosphate dehydrogenase gene and the mannitol-specific factor iii gene of the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system.
AB  == streptococcus mutans, the causative agent of dental caries, utilizes carbohydrates by means of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (pts). the pts facilitates vectorial translocation of metabolizable carbohydrates to form the corresponding sugar-phosphates, which are subsequently  converted to glycolytic intermediates. the pts consists of both sugar-specific and sugar-independent components. complementation of an escherichia coli mtld mutation with a streptococcal recombinant dna library allowed isolation of the mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (mtld) and the adjacent sugar-specific mannitol factor iii gene (mtlf) from s. mutans. subsequent transposon mutagenesis of the complementing dna fragment with tn5seq1 defined the region that encodes the mtld-complementing activity, the streptococcal mtld gene. nucleotide sequence analysis of this region revealed two complete open reading frames (orfs) from within the streptococcal mannitol pts operon. one orf encodes the mtld gene product, a 43.0-kda protein which exhibits similarity to the e. coli and enterococcus faecalis mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenases. the second orf encodes a 15.8-kda protein which exhibits similarity to mannitol factor iii proteins from several bacterial species. in vitro transcription-translation assays were used to produce proteins of the sizes predicted by the streptococcal orfs. these data indicate that the s. mutans mannitol pts utilizes an enzyme ii-factor iii complex similar to the mannitol system found in other gram-positive organisms, as opposed to that of e. coli, which utilizes an independent enzyme ii system.

AB  == the dentocult sm ("strip mutans") method occasionally shows decoloration of broth and of colonies of mutans streptococci on the plastic strip, thereby making interpretation difficult. in an attempt to explain the phenomenon and to investigate the influence of the salivary flora on the "strip mutans" method, a total of 46 subjects were sampled. saliva was analyzed using the "strip mutans" method and conventional plating techniques to identify mutans streptococci, enterococci, staphylococci, enteric bacteria, and yeasts. approximately 85% of the "strip mutans" scores coincided with the conventional msb-plating method. two samples showed decolored mutans streptococci colonies on the "strip mutans" strip. enterococcus spp. were present in the saliva of these test subjects and could grow in the "strip mutans" broth. enterococcus faecalis was able to induce  the same type of decoloration under experimental pure culture conditions. three "strip mutans" samples showed small colonies of mutans streptococci, visible only under magnification (x 10-20). staphylococcus epidermidis was present in these saliva samples and showed heavy growth in the broth. under experimental pure culture conditions s. epidermidis also inhibited the growth of mutans streptococci to some extent.

TI  == determination of the chromosomal size of three different strains of enterococcus  faecalis and one strain of enterococcus faecium.
AB  == pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to determine the chromosomal size of three different strains of enterococcus faecalis and one strain of enterococcus faecium. the size determinations of og1x, a strain of e. faecalis widely used in  many laboratories for genetic studies, using sma i, not i, and sfi i alone or in  combination, ranged from 2,750 to 2,761 kb. using the same enzymes as with og1x,  the size of hh-67, a plasmid-free clinical isolate of e. faecalis, was determined to be 2,170-2,288 kb and the size of jh2-2, an e. faecalis recipient strain, ranged from 2,008 to 2,135 kb. the size range generated for ge-1, a plasmid-free  e. faecium strain, with the use of sma i, not i, and apa i was 2,045-2,155 kb. although og1x differed in size from the other three enterococci, each individual  enterococcal strain generated reproducible results in different experiments. however, for both e. faecalis og1x and e. faecium ge-1, one of the enzymes used generated a considerably smaller molecular size than that generated by the other  two enzymes. the discrepancy was due to visually undiscernible comigrating fragments, and serves to point out a potential source of error if fewer than two  enzymes are used to size a genome. the size discrepancies were resolved by digesting individual fragments with a second enzyme. the molecular sizes of these enterococcal strains are larger than that recently reported for campylobacter, smaller than that of escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and similar (og1x) or smaller (jh2-2, hh67, and ge-1) than the 2,819-kb reported for streptococcus mutans.

TI  == salivary-agglutinin-mediated adherence of streptococcus mutans to early plaque bacteria.
AB  == interspecies binding is important in the colonization of the oral cavity by bacteria. streptococcus mutans can adhere to other plaque bacteria, such as streptococcus sanguis and actinomyces viscosus, and this adherence is enhanced by saliva. the salivary and bacterial molecules that mediate this interaction were investigated. salivary agglutinin, a mucinlike glycoprotein known to mediate the  aggregation of many oral streptococci in vitro, was found to mediate the adherence of s. mutans to s. sanguis or a. viscosus. adherence of s. mutans to saliva- or agglutinin-coated s. sanguis and a. viscosus was inhibited by antibodies to the bacterial agglutinin receptor. expression of the s. sanguis receptor (ssp-5) gene in enterococcus faecalis increased adhesion of this organism to saliva- or agglutinin-coated s. sanguis and a. viscosus. this interaction could be inhibited by antibodies to the agglutinin receptor. the results suggest that salivary agglutinin can promote adherence of s. mutans to s. sanguis and a. viscosus through interactions with the agglutinin receptor on s. mutans.

AB  == calcium hydroxide preparations ca(oh)2 are used as water solutions, putly, liner, cement or artificial material. the therapeutic effect of each medicaments depends on physical and chemical characteristic of additional components. the aim of the  paper is to research the sensitivity of streptococcus faecalis and candida albicans to different water solution concentrations of calcium hydroxide. as solid plates, bacto-mitis-salivarius agar was used for s. mutans, torlak blood agar for s. faecalis and sabourand agar "torlak" for c. albicans. the holes were  drilled in solid plates and were filled by 0.2 ml of water solutions of ca(oh)2.  preparations, created as described were incubated aerobically at 37 degrees c in  the period of 48 hrs. results were read after 24 as well as after 48 hrs. the examined solutions of ca(oh)2, revealed the highest antimicrobic effect after 24  hrs. the result remained unchanged even after 48 hrs. the inhibition of s. mutans growth on the solid plate occurred with the concentration of ca(oh)2 solution from 271.18 x 10(-2) mol/dm3 and ph 12.76. the growth of s. faecalis at the solid plate was inhibited with the concentration of 3335.21 x 10(-3) mol/dm3 and ph 12.82. the inhibition of c. albicans growth on solid plate occurred with the concentration of ca(oh)2 solution from 1023.20 x 10(-3) mol/dm3 and ph 12.84. the difference in the sensitivity of the examined microorganisms at the same concentrations of ca(oh)2 solution was observed.

TI  == coaggregation of streptococcus sanguis and other streptococci with candida albicans.
AB  == thirteen strains of viridans group streptococci and two strains of other streptococci were tested for coaggregation with candida albicans. streptococcus sanguis strains generally exhibited low levels of adherence to 28 degrees c-grown exponential-phase yeast cells, but starvation of yeast cells for glucose at 37 degrees c (or at 28 degrees c) increased their coaggregating activity with these  streptococci by at least tenfold. this was a property common to four c. albicans  strains tested, two of which were able to form mycelia (6406 and men) and two of  which were not (mm2002 and ca2). the expression of the coaggregation adhesin during yeast cell starvation was inhibited by addition of trichodermin or amphotericin b. the strains of s. sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus oralis tested for coaggregating activity encompassed a diverse range of physiological and morphological types, yet all exhibited saturable coaggregation with starved c. albicans cells. there was no correlation of cell surface hydrophobicity, of either yeast or streptococcal cells, with their abilities to coaggregate. strains of streptococcus anginosus also coaggregated with starved yeast cells; streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus pyogenes coaggregated to a lesser degree with c. albicans, and the coaggregation with s. pyogenes was not promoted by yeast cell starvation; streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis did not coaggregate with yeast. the coaggregation reactions of s. sanguis and s. gordonii with c. albicans were inhibited by edta and by heat or protease treatment of the yeast cells and were not reversible by the addition  of lactose or other simple sugars. these observations extend the range of intergeneric coaggregations that are known to occur between oral microbes and suggest that coaggregations of c. albicans with viridans group streptococci may be important for colonization of oral surfaces by the yeast.

TI  == [transfer of bacterial drug resistance factor in artificial dental plaque].
AB  == transfer of drug resistance factor was examined using so-called artificial dental plaque. clinically isolated specimens of enterococcus faecalis showing various kind of drug resistance were used as the donors. streptococcus mutans bht strain  was used as the recipient and the plaque former. s. mutans formed artificial dental plaque on the surface of glass sticks after 7 to 10 day cultivation in brain heart infusion medium containing 5% sucrose. each strain of e. faecalis was added to the plaque culture and co-cultured further 24 hours. colonies were formed on drug-containing plates by 5 different mixed cultures with the frequencies of 10(-5)-10(-6) (kanamycin, km) and 10(-4)-10(-8) (erythromycin, em). since these values were higher than that of the mutation frequency, we conclude that the resistant sublines were formed by a genetic transfer. plasmid dna derived from some transferred sublines was electrophoreted and the patterns were compared with those from the donor and the recipient. one km-resistant subline showed a new band at the point of 40 kb which was not found in the plasmid dna from the donor. it is suggested that the plasmid containing km-resistance gene was modified molucularly. sublines without new plasmid band were obtained also. there may be technical problems with it, or the transferred gene may be incorporated in a chromosome. considering above results, the effect of bacterial transferable genes on oral hygiene were discussed.

AB  == a total of 287 clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) were  tested for their ability to undergo autolysis when treated with sodium deoxycholate. the test was positive for all but one isolate, strain doc-1. this autolysis required the activity of an enzyme which is unique and characteristic of s. pneumoniae: a choline-dependent n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, the gene product of the lyta gene. we used lyta as a dna probe to test the distribution of the autolysin gene among clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae. in dot blot hybridization experiments our probe reacted with the dna of 60 of 60 strains tested, including the autolysis-deficient clinical isolate doc-1. no hybridization occurred when strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus bovis were tested. the lyta gene appears to be an ideal candidate for use as a dna probe for the identification of s. pneumoniae.

TI  == antibiotic resistance and production of inhibitory substances among bacterial strains isolated from the oral cavities of balb/c mice.
AB  == in the oral cavities of balb/c mice, microbial population levels are regulated by multifactorial processes. factors include the production of inhibitory substances and the exchange of genetic material. in this work, 371 isolates from different sites (saliva, tongue, teeth, and mucosa) of the oral cavities of balb/c mice were screened for resistance to antibiotics and antimicrobial activity. antibiotic-resistant strains represented 25% of the total flora. among the predominant species, all the s. faecalis isolates showed multiresistance, and 23% of the lactobacillus murinus isolates and 15% of the staphylococcus aureus were resistant to at least one antibiotic. resistance to aminoglycosides (neomycin, streptomycin, kanamycin, and gentamicin) was most frequently encountered. in s. faecalis, high levels of resistance were recorded to neomycin and streptomycin but not to gentamicin or kanamycin. macrolides (m), lincosamides (l), streptogramin b (s), tetracycline (tc), and chloramphenicol (cm) resistance was also present in multiresistance patterns, especially among s. faecalis isolates.  hemolytic (hly+) streptococci were less resistant to mls, tc, and cm than were non-hemolytic (hly-) isolates. resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics was detected only among staphylococci and with a low prevalence (4%). the frequencies of strains producing antimicrobial substances against the indicator strains (s. mutans lg-1, s. sanguis ny 101, and a. viscosus ny 1) were high for l. murinus (76%) and s. faecalis (57% for hly- and 90% for hly+), but low for s. aureus (7%). these results indicate that the indigenous oral flora could interfere with  colonization by allochthonous micro-organisms and that resistance patterns should be taken into account for the elimination of the oral indigenous flora by antibiotic treatment.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the purified bacteriocin was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes such as trypsin, alpha-chymotrypsin and pronase, but resistant to papain and pepsin. lowering the  ph of the bacteriocin caused precipitation, and the abs280 of the supernatant reached a minimum at ph 3.6, suggesting that this is the isoelectric point. such  a ph value coincides with minimum bacteriocin activity. the effect of the bacteriocin was bactericidal rather than bacteriolytic and concentration dependent. treatment of streptococcus faecalis odu with rm-10 bacteriocin led rapidly to the cessation of biosynthesis of macromolecules, dna, rna and protein. electron microscopy showed bacteriocin fibres attached in aggregated bundles to target cells; after ultra-sonication or detergent treatment they were individually attached to the cell surface and, at the same time, the apparent bacteriocin activity had doubled. bacteriocin activity was not altered by filter-sterilized saliva components. oral rinsing with rm-10 bacteriocin reduced  the number of viable salivary bacteria after 20 min, suggesting a possible therapeutic use for rm-10 bacteriocin.

AB  == plasmid pam beta 1, originally isolated from streptococcus faecalis ds5, mediates resistance to the mls (macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b alpha) group of antibiotics. a restriction endonuclease map of the 26.5-kilobase (kb) pam beta 1 molecule was constructed by using the enzymes avai, hpaii, ecori, pvuii, kpn1,  bsteii, hpai, hhai, and hindiii. a comparison of this map to those of four independently isolated deletion derivatives of pam beta 1 located the mls resistance determinant within a 2-kb dna segment and at least one conjugative function within an 8-kb region. the 5.0-kb ecori-b fragment from pam beta 1 was ligated onto the 4.0-kb escherichia coli plasmid vector, packc1, and used to transform e. coli hb101. the 9.0-kb chimeric plasmid was then used to transform streptococcus sanguis challis with concurrent expression of the e. coli kanamycin resistance determinant. the 5.0-kb ecori-b fragment from pam beta 1 was subsequently used as a vector to clone a streptomycin resistance determinant from a strain of streptococcus mutans containing no detectable plasmid dna. subcloning experiments, using a hindiii partial digest of pam beta 1 dna, narrowed the replication region of this plasmid to a 2.95-kb fragment.

TI  == streptococci isolated from the bloodstream and gingival crevice of man.
AB  == one hundred and twenty six strains of streptococci isolated from the bloodstreams of 123 hospital in-patients--55 with endocarditis--and 255 strains isolated from  the gingival crevices of 66 volunteers were characterised. species isolated were  streptococcus mitior, s. sanguis, undifferentiated viridans streptococci, s. salivarius, s. milleri, s. mutans, s. bovis and s. faecalis. there was no significant difference between the distribution of species in blood and in the gingival crevice. s. mitior and s. sanguis were found less frequently in blood than their presence in the gingival crevice would have suggested, whereas s. milleri was found more frequently. this may indicate that s. milleri is more invasive or that it enters the bloodstream from sources other than the gingival crevice.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of streptococcus.
AB  == a numerical taxonomic study of strains of streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. the major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (s. faecalis, s. faecium, 's. avium' and a proposed new species 's. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (s. bovis, s. equinus, s. salivarius, 's. casseliflavus', s. mutans, s. raffinolactis and an unidentified oral group i); (c) lactic species group (s. lactis including s. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (s. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (s. mitis, s. sanguis, a proposed new species 's. oralis' and 's. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. equi, 's. equisimilis' including 's. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of lancefield group b strains of human origin);  (g) parapyogenic species group (s. uberis, 's. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of lancefield groups r, s and t). species of aerococcus, gemella, leuconostoc and pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.

TI  == [characterization of the antigen in circulating immune complexes and application  to the detection of streptococcal antigens in human infectious endocarditis].
AB  == immune complexes from patients with subacute endocarditis were used to develop a  methodology for characterization of the antigen involved in human circulating immune complexes. this model was chosen because it permits isolation of the causative agent of the streptococcal infection thought to contain the antigen present in the immune complex. a comparison was made between two methods for characterization of bacterial antigen bound to antibody. in the first, animals were immunized with purified immune complexes and the production of antistreptococcal antibodies was investigated. in the second method, a sandwich elisa was developed, implying the double specificity of the immune complex (human immunoglobulin and streptococcal antigen). the latter method gave the best results, detecting antigen in the immune complexes of 8 out of 10 patients' sera. the application of this method to other immunopathological situations is discussed.

TI  == bacteriolytic activity of human gingival exudate.
AB  == we investigated the bacteriolytic activity of gingival crevicular fluid (cf) on 14c-labeled streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus,  and on whole dental plaque. cf was collected from 100 healthy donors pooled and centrifuged at 200 g. cf supernate and a frozen and thawed extract of the pellet  were interacted with the different bacterial strains, while streptococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus released 60% and 75% of the radioactive label, only 38% of it was solubilized from streptococcus mutans, following their incubation with the cf supernate. the findings agreed with results obtained by interacting bacteria with a frozen and thawed lysate of human peripheral blood leukocytes. on the other hand, extracts from frozen and thawed cf pellet were inactive. further, lipoteichoic acid and lipopolysaccharide were released by cf from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respectively. the role of bacteriolytic factors, present in cf, as a result of the interaction between microorganisms and leukocytes at inflammatory sites is discussed.

TI  == does penicillin kill bacteria?.
AB  == the thesis is presented that the bactericidal action of penicillin and of other inhibitors of cell wall peptidoglycan synthesis, such as vancomycin and cycloserine, is secondary or tertiary to their ability inhibit specific reactions in the assembly of an osmotically protective cell wall. examples are given of the inhibition of these reactions, which results in inhibition of cell growth (bacteriostatic action) in the absence of either cellular lysis or rapid loss of  viability. thus, in some instances, inhibitory concentrations of these drugs are, in effect, sublethal; this is true, for example, for streptococcus mutans, a species of bacteria that is part of the normal flora of the oropharynx and that can cause subacute bacterial endocarditis. on the other hand, the damaging effects of the subminimal inhibitory concentrations of penicillin g on streptococcus faecalis, a species with an active autolytic enzyme system, can be  uncovered and converted to a lytic (and lethal) response by partial inhibition of fatty acid synthesis with low concentrations of cerulenin. some theoretical and practical implications of the occurrence and inhibition of these secondary lethal consequences are discussed.

TI  == superoxide dismutase and oxygen metabolism in streptococcus faecalis and comparisons with other organisms.
AB  == streptococcus faecalis contains a single superoxide dismutase that has been purified to homogeneity with a 55% yield. this enzyme has a molecular weight of 45,000 and is composed of two subunits of equal size. it contains 1.3 atoms of manganese per molecule. its amino acid composition was determined and is compared with that for the superoxide dismutases from escherichia coli, streptococcus mutans, and mycobacterium lepraemurium. when used as an antigen in rabbits, the s. faecalis enzyme elicited the formation of a precipitating and inhibiting antibody. this antibody cross-reacted with the superoxide dismutase present in another strain of s. faecalis, but neither inhibited nor precipitated the superoxide dismutases in a wide range of other bacteria, including several other  streptococci, such as s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, and s. lactis. the inhibiting antibody was used to suppress the superoxide dismutase activity present in cell extracts of s. faecalis and thus allow the demonstration that 17% of the total oxygen consumption by such extracts, in the presence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, was associated with the production of o(2) (-). a variety of bacterial species were surveyed for their content of superoxide dismutases. the iron-containing enzyme was distinguished from the manganese-containing enzyme through the use of h(2)o(2), which inactivates the former more readily than the latter. some of the bacteria appeared to contain only the iron enzyme, others only the manganese enzyme, and still others both. indeed, some had multiple, electrophoretically distinct superoxide dismutases in both categories. there was  no discernible absolute relationship between the types of superoxide dismutases in a particular organism and their gram-stain reaction.

AB  == the acid production from maltitol was compared with the acid production from hydrogenated starch hydrolysate (lycasin), sorbitol and xylitol by a number of oral strains and reference strains of streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. mitior, s. milleri, s. faecalis, s. faecium, s. avium, lactobacillus casei and l. salivarius. the polyols were added to a final concentration of 1.0% to two different basal media. incubation was performed at 37 degrees c for 7 days after which the ph was recorded. maltitol was fermented only by the lactobacilli (about two thirds of the strains). lycasin was fermented by all strains of s. faecalis, more than 90% of the lactobacilli, about half of the s. sanguis strains, about one third of the s. mutans strains, and by a few other streptococcal strains. acid production from sorbitol was observed among more than 80% of the s. mutans strains and the s. faecalis strains and most of the lactobacilli strains. sorbitol-fermenting strains of s. sanguis and of s. mitior, all isolated from sorbitol-consumers, were observed. no other sorbitol-fermenting streptococci were found. only the reference strains l. salivarius subsp. salivarius atcc 11741 and s. avium atcc 14025 fermented xylitol.

TI  == selective adsorption of heterophile polyglycerophosphate antigen from antigen extracts of streptococcus mutans and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == hot saline extracts of streptococcus mutans have been shown to contain antigenic  substances which occasionally react nonspecifically with some antisera against whole cells of various serological groups and types of streptococci. chromatography of the extract of s. mutans strain mt703 (serotype e) on a diethylaminoethyl-sephadex a-25 column gave two principal antigens. one antigen was eluted without adsorption to the resin and was identified as the serotype-specific polysaccharide. the other antigen, which contained a large quantity of phosphorus, was absorbed to and released from the resin by gradient elution. it was reactive against the antisera specific for polyglycerophosphate (pgp) from group a streptococcus pyogenes and/or s. mutans strain ingbritt (type  c). the pgp antigen was further purified by gel filtration with sephadex g-75. two peaks, pgp-1, and pgp-2, were obtained. each possessed the same antigenic specificity to anti-pgp serum as shown by immunodiffusion. chemical analyses revealed that the molar ratio of phosphorus to glycerol in both was about 1:1, although the protein content between the two was significantly different. pgp antigen was found to be widely distributed in hot saline extracts from various gram-positive bacteria, with a few exceptions. however, all gram-negative bacteria examined were free of pgp. the pgp in the hot saline extracts of various gram-positive bacteria possessed an essentially identical antigenic specificity.  the addition of diethylaminoethyl-sephadex a-25 resin to hot saline extracts successfully removed the cross-reacting pgp antigen. after adsorption of the extract from s. mutans, the supernatant contained only type-specific polysaccharide antigen, except type b, in which both type b-specific polysaccharide and pgp antigens were absorbed with the resin. this simple procedure should be useful for the removal of the pgp-type teichoic acid from antigen extracts of bacteria that contain uncharged polysaccharides.

AB  == examination of both supernatant culture medium and cell pellets after exponential- and stationary-phase growth of streptococcus mutans strain fa-1 and  streptococcus faecalis atcc 9790 (s. faecium) showed the presence of [-3h]glycerol-labeled material that possessed several of the properties of glycerol teichoic acid. in the supernatant medium of s. mutans fa-1, an apparently large-molecular-size material, which eluted from agarose columns with  the kd value expected of a lipoteichoic acid, was observed. large amounts of this material were present in supernatants during the stationary phase. in contrast, with s. faecalis only an apparently lower-molecular-weight form, with a kd consistent with deacylated glycerol teichoic acid, was found in the growth medium. both organisms had high-molecular-weight lipoteichoic acid in the cells along with the deacylated glycerol teichoic acid. the presence of relatively large amounts of glycerol teichoic acids in the medium was considered to be a result of excretion of these compounds rather than a result of cellular lysis.

TI  == the effect of leukocyte hydrolases on bacteria. iii. bacteriolysis induced by extracts of different leukocyte populations and the inhibition of lysis by macromolecular substances.
AB  == the lysis of 14c-labeled bacteria by hydrolases of human and rabbit leukocytes was studied in vitro. while staphylococcus albus, streptococcus faecalis, and streptococcus mutans were highly susceptible to lysis, staphylococcus auresus was intermediate in its susecptibility to lysis by the leukocyte enzymes. group a streptococcus, listeria monocytogenes, shigella flexneri, escherichia coli, and mycobacterium smegmatis were very resistant to degradation by these enzymes. the  lytic activity of leukocyte lysates from human and rabbit blood was probably due  to acid hydrolases of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. extracts of human blood monocytes and of rabbit peritoneal and lung macrophages were less lytic for the bacteria tested. lymphocytes and platelet extracts were not bacteriolytic. the lytic effect of the leukocyte lysates was not inhibited by kcn or sodium azide, but was abolished to a large extent by cationic polyelectrolytes such as protamine sulfate, histone and leukocyte cationic proteins, and poly-lysine, as well as by the anionic polyelectrolytes such as heparin, chondroitin sulfate, dna, carrageenin, alginate sulfate, dextran sulfate, and ploy-l-glutamic acid. other potent inhibitors of bacteriolysis were trypan blue, congo red, phosphatidic acid, normal immunoglobulins, and components of streptococcal cell wall.
