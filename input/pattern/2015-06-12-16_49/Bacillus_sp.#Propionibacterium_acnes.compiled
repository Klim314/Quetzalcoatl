TI  - Modulation of Th1/Th2 immune responses by killed Propionibacterium acnes and its  soluble polysaccharide fraction in a type I hypersensitivity murine model: induction of different activation status of antigen-presenting cells.
AB  - Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) is a gram-positive anaerobic bacillus present  in normal human skin microbiota, which exerts important immunomodulatory effects, when used as heat- or phenol-killed suspensions. We previously demonstrated that heat-killed P. acnes or its soluble polysaccharide (PS), extracted from the bacterium cell wall, suppressed or potentiated the Th2 response to ovalbumin (OVA) in an immediate hypersensitivity model, depending on the treatment protocol. Herein, we investigated the mechanisms responsible for these effects, using the same model and focusing on the activation status of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). We verified that higher numbers of APCs expressing costimulatory molecules and higher expression levels of these molecules are probably related to potentiation of the Th2 response to OVA induced by P. acnes or PS, while higher expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs) seems to be related to Th2 suppression. In vitro cytokines production in cocultures of dendritic cells and T lymphocytes indicated that P. acnes and PS seem to perform their effects by acting directly on APCs. Our data suggest that P. acnes and PS directly act on APCs, modulating the expression of costimulatory molecules and TLRs, and these differently activated APCs drive distinct T helper patterns to OVA in our model.
TI  - Photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen HCl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (7 species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol, Baxter Healthcare) or saline. After PCT with 150 micro mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) UVA, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. RESULTS: The level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. Log reduction of Gram-positive bacteria for Staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for Staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for Streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for Listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for Corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for Bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for Lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for Propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for Clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. Log reduction of Gram-negative bacteria for Escherichia coli was > 6.4; for Serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for Klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for Salmonella choleraesuis, > 6.2; for Yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for Enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. Log reduction of spirochetes for Treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for Borrelia burgdorferi, > 6.9. CONCLUSION: PCT inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. The inactivation of bacteria in PLT concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent PLT-transfusion-associated bacteremia.
TI  - Beta-lactamase production and antimicrobial susceptibility of subgingival bacteria from refractory periodontitis.
AB  - This study assessed the extent of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in subgingival plaque samples obtained from 25 patients with refractory marginal periodontitis in the USA. beta-Lactamase-positive isolates were characterized using commercial diagnostic kits and partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The susceptibilities to different antimicrobial agents were tested and, in addition, the isolates were screened for the presence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were detected in 18 (72%) patients. The most prominent beta-lactamase-producing organisms belonged to the anaerobic genus Prevotella. Other enzyme-producing anaerobic strains were Fusobacterium nucleatum, Propionibacterium acnes and Peptostreptococcus sp. Facultative bacteria, such as Burkholderia spp., Ralstonia pickettii, Capnocytophaga spp., Bacillus spp., Staphylococcus spp. and Neisseria sp., were also detected among the enzyme-producers. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ampicillin and amoxicillin were in the range 1.5-256 micrograms/ml and 4-256 micrograms/ml, respectively, for the isolates of the Prevotella species. All Prevotella isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate and metronidazole, but they showed variable resistance to tetracyclines. Two of the Prevotella isolates had high MICs of cefotaxime and ceftazidime. ESBL activity was not detected in any of the beta-lactamase-producing isolates by the Etest method. Thus, our study demonstrated a wide variety of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria that may play a role in refractory periodontal disease.
TI  - beta-Hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms in apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis.
AB  - Thirteen teeth with necrotic pulps and apical periodontitis and nine severe periodontal pockets were cultured for presence of beta-hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms. Samples were dispersed and plated on two non-selective and one selective growth media and incubated anaerobically and in 10% CO2 in air. A total of 59 beta-hemolytic colonies were purified and identified. Eight beta-hemolytic streptococcal isolates were obtained from three of the severe marginal periodontitis sites. All were identified as belonging to the Streptococcus sanguis group. No beta-hemolytic streptococci were detected in apical periodontitis samples. Twenty obligately anaerobic isolates were detected, all of which were known periodontal and endodontic pathogens. Isolates from apical periodontitis sites were identified as Propionibacterium acnes, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actionomyces odontolyticus and Peptostreptococcus micros, while severe marginal periodontal sites contained the same species with the addition of Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces meyeri. Of 19 staphylococci and micrococci, Staphylococcus epidermidis was the predominant isolate in both apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis sites. However, less commonly known organisms such as Staphylococcus cohnii and Micrococcus sp. were identified in severe marginal periodontitis sites. The isolation of Bacillus sp. (12 isolates) in one severe marginal periodontitis and two apical periodontitis subjects was especially interesting, warranting consideration of this organism as a legitimate isolate and potential pathogen in oral disease.
TI  - Effect of the bacillus of Calmette-Guerin, Propionibacter acnes and avridine as immunomodulators in antirabies vaccination of mice using the Fuenzalida-Palacios mouse brain vaccine.
AB  - Using the laboratory mice, Fuenzalida-Palacios mouse brain human rabies vaccine was administered in groups of animals previously inoculated with rabies virus and then submitted to treatments with the immunomodulators onco-BCG, avridine and Propionibacterium acnes. Humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated through the macrophage inhibition factor (MIF), intra-pad inoculation (IPI) and serum neutralization (SN) tests and by the detection of gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma). The IPI test was not effective in detecting the response of delayed-type hypersensitivity, contrary to MIF, which showed the immune cellular response. Higher levels of IFN-gamma were observed in the groups of mice vaccinated and treated with avridine and P. acnes. Although immunomodulating activities have been detected, the use of adjuvants with the Fuenzalida-Palacios type vaccine in mice did not reveal any encouraging results.
TI  - Adherence of bacteria to intraocular lenses: a prospective study.
AB  - AIMS: The study was designed to investigate the bacterial flora of the operating  field during routine cataract surgery and the source of intraocular lens contamination during the surgery. METHODS: The normal flora of the external eye and fornices of 17 patients undergoing selective cataract surgery was determined preoperatively. Swabs taken from the eyelid surface and lashes showed coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) in 90%, Propionibacterium acnes in 62%, Corynebacterium sp in 18%, and Peptostreptococcus in 3% of the patients. The lower fornices of 70% had CNS, 47% P acnes, 6% Staphylococcus aureus, 6% Corynebacterium sp, and 6% Candida. RESULTS: A sterile PMMA intraocular lens was touched on the upper bulbar conjunctiva immediately before the surgery. Eighty two per cent of lenses grew CNS, 18% P acnes, 18% Bacillus sp, 12% S aureus, and 6% Corynebacterium sp. A second sterile PMMA intraocular lens was left on the drape and near the eye during surgery. Forty seven per cent of these cultured CNS, 12% Corynebacterium sp, and 6% Bacillus sp. A high count of bacteria in the operating field, especially CNS and P acnes can contribute to postoperative inflammation and endophthalmitis. CONCLUSION: Special measures are needed before and during the surgery to reduce the chance of intraocular inoculation of these bacteria. Use of proper culture media and techniques are necessary to identify these organisms, especially anaerobes, in postoperative inflammation.
TI  - Bacteremia after upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.
AB  - During 24 months, 200 upper gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed on 193 patients. Blood cultures were obtained before and five and 30 minutes after the procedure using thiol (50 ml) and trypticase soy broth (100 ml) media. The mean endoscopic time was 34 minutes. Sixteen patients developed bacteremia (8%). Twelve groups of microorganisms were detected in positive blood cultures: Streptococcus (5 species), Lactobacillus sp, Veillonella alcalescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Staph epidermidis, Propioni-bacterium acnes, Corynebacterium acnes, and Bacillus subtilis. Seven patients had positive blood cultures at five and 30 minutes, eight at five minutes, and one at 30 minutes only. There was no clear correlation of bacteremia with the age or previous history of the patient, biopsy, active bleeding, endoscopic time, or findings. A follow-up study of all patients for six months to two years indicated no complications related to endoscopy and/or bacteremia.
TI  - A special report: four-year study of a boy with combined immune deficiency maintained in strict reverse isolation from birth.
AB  - A 4-year study of a boy with combined immune deficiency is presented, and the impact of this disease on various aspects of his growth and development is examined. There is no evidence of immune deficiency in either parent or in the genetic background on the maternal side. Three children of a brother of the mother's father may have had immune deficiencies but two have grown to be teenagers with no problems. Another died. At autopsy, however, lymph nodes appeared normal. The deceased older brother had severe combined immune deficiency (SCID). The autopsy findings showed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia to be the direct cause of death and these findings contributed to the diagnosis of SCID. After a successful germ-free birth, the male infant (DV) was placed in the isolator. Laboratory tests were normal except that the x-rays showed no thymic shadow, his absolute lymphocyte count ranged from 399-440/mm and the lymphocytes showed no proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Specific tests showed the antibody-producing immune system and the cell-mediated immune system to be severely defective. The patient's lymphocytes elicited positive responses by lymphocytes from father, mother, and sister. Subsequent search in national and international tissue-typing laboratories has shown four HLA matches but none has been nonreactive in mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC). therefore, this patient has remained in isolation to the present; now he is 4 years old. Approximately 35 species of microorganisms, mostly transient contaminants, have been isolated, taking into account that the same organism may have been identified under different names in different laboratories. Those isolated frequently and in sufficiently high concentration to indicate colonization have been speciated as follows: anaerobes-Propionibacterium acnes, Lactobacillus catenaforme (disappeared spontaneously), Bacteroides oralis ss. elongatus, Clostridium (perenne, hastiforme, bifermentans), Bacteroides clostridiiformis ss. clostridiiformis; aerobes-Alcaligenes faecalis (eradicated by antibiotics), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter agglomerans, Microcossu sp. subgroup 1, Bacillus pulvifaciens (disappeared spontaneously); yeasts-Candida (tropicalis, parapsilosis). Seven are considered to be probable components of the current autoflora: P. acnes, C. bifermentans, B. clostridiiformis ss. clostridiiformis, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus sp. subgroup 1, E. agglomerans, C. parapsilosis. No viruses or protozoa have been isolated. At age 3 years, the mean quantitation of anaerobic cells was 7.9 X 10(7) viable cells/g feces; this falls short of the mean anaerobic load from normal children. The mean aerobic concentration was 1.2 X 10(8) viable cells/g feces, not unlike normal children. Qualitatively his flora has abnormally few species and lacks those most common in normal subjects. This child has had no evidence of infection and has always been in excellent health even though some organisms which could be pathogenic under some circumstances have been isolated...
