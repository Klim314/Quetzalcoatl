TI  - Microbial dynamics during conversion from supragingival to subgingival biofilms in an in vitro model.
AB  - The development of dental caries and periodontal diseases result from distinct shifts in the microbiota of the tooth-associated biofilm. This in vitro study aimed to investigate changes in biofilm composition and structure, during the shift from a "supragingival" aerobic to a "subgingival" anaerobic profile. Biofilms consisting of Actinomyces oris, Candida albicans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mutans and Veillonella dispar were aerobically grown in saliva-containing medium on hydroxyapatite discs. After 64 h, Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella intermedia and Streptococcus anginosus were further added along with human serum, while culture conditions were shifted to microaerophilic. After 96 h, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia and Treponema denticola were finally added and the biofilm was grown anaerobically for another 64 h. At the end of each phase, biofilms were harvested for species-specific quantification and localization. Apart from C. albicans, all other species gradually increased during aerobic and microaerophilic conditions, but remained steady during anaerobic conditions. Biofilm thickness was doubled during the microaerophilic phase, but remained steady throughout the anaerobic phase. Extracellular polysaccharide presence was gradually reduced throughout the growth period. Biofilm viability was reduced during the microaerophilic conversion, but was recovered during the anaerobic phase. This in vitro study has characterized the dynamic structural shifts occurring in an oral biofilm model during the switch from aerobic to anaerobic conditions, potentially modeling the conversion of supragingival to subgingival biofilms. Within the limitations of this experimental model, the findings may provide novel insights into the ecology of oral biofilms. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
TI  - Oral Microbiota Shift after 12-Week Supplementation with Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 and PTA 5289; A Randomized Control Trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus spp. potentially contribute to health by modulating bacterial biofilm formation, but their effects on the overall oral microbiota remain unclear. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Oral microbiota was characterized via 454-pyrosequencing of the 16S rDNA hypervariable region V3-V4 after 12 weeks of daily Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 and PTA 5289 consumption. Forty-four adults were assigned to a test group (n = 22) that received lactobacilli lozenges (108 CFU of each strain/lozenge) or a control group that received placebo (n = 22). Presence of L. reuteri was confirmed by cultivation and species specific PCR. Tooth biofilm samples from 16 adults before, during, and after exposure were analyzed by pyrosequencing. A total of 1,310,292 sequences were quality filtered. After removing single reads, 257 species or phylotypes were identified at 98.5% identity in the Human Oral Microbiome Database. Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla. Streptococcus was the most common genus and the S. oralis/S. mitis/S. mitis bv2/S. infantis group comprised the dominant species. The number of observed species was unaffected by L. reuteri exposure. However, subjects who had consumed L. reuteri were clustered in a principal coordinates analysis relative to scattering at baseline, and multivariate modeling of pyrosequencing microbiota, and culture and PCR detected L. reuteri separated baseline from 12-week samples in test subjects. L. reuteri intake correlated with increased S. oralis/S. mitis/S. mitis bv2/S. infantis group and Campylobacter concisus, Granulicatella adiacens, Bergeyella sp. HOT322, Neisseria subflava, and SR1 [G-1] sp. HOT874 detection and reduced S. mutans, S. anginosus, N. mucosa, Fusobacterium periodicum, F. nucleatum ss vincentii, and Prevotella maculosa detection. This effect had disappeared 1 month after exposure was terminated. CONCLUSIONS: L. reuteri consumption did not affect species richness but induced a shift in the oral microbiota composition. The biological relevance of this remains to be elucidated. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02311218.
TI  - Isolation of alkaline-tolerant bacteria from primary infected root canals.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alkaline-tolerant bacteria in primary infected root canals could have enhanced survival capacity against antimicrobials commonly used in root canal treatment. The aims of this study were to isolate and characterize alkaline-tolerant bacteria before endodontic treatment (S1), after chemomechanical root canal preparation (S2), and after calcium hydroxide dressing (S3). METHODS: Bacteriologic samples were obtained from 43 primary infected root canals. Samples were inoculated into culture media at a pH of 9 and incubated anaerobically. The identities of bacterial isolates were determined by 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. RESULTS: All S1 samples were culture positive, with 70% harboring bacteria tolerating a pH of 9. Gram-positive bacteria Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus and Streptococcus spp were the most frequently isolated strains with a prevalence of 54%. Of 13 culture-positive S2 samples, 8 isolates tolerated a pH of 9, namely Streptococcus sanguinis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cancerogenus, Streptococcus oralis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Seven of these 8 isolates (88%) were correspondingly isolated at S1. All 3 culture-positive S3 samples tolerated a pH of 9, namely S. sanguinis and E. faecalis, which were also isolated in the corresponding S1 and S2 samples. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that the presence of alkaline-tolerant Streptococcus and Enterococcus spp in primary infected root canals could lead to their persistence during and after root canal treatment and could pose a challenge to current treatment efficacy.
TI  - Subgingival microbiome in smokers and non-smokers in Korean chronic periodontitis patients.
AB  - Smoking is a major environmental factor associated with periodontal diseases. However, we still have a very limited understanding of the relationship between smoking and subgingival microflora in the global population. Here, we investigated the composition of subgingival bacterial communities from the pooled plaque samples of smokers and non-smokers, 134 samples in each group, in Korean patients with moderate chronic periodontitis using 16S rRNA gene-based pyrosequencing. A total of 17,927 reads were analyzed and classified into 12 phyla, 126 genera, and 394 species. Differences in bacterial communities between smokers and non-smokers were examined at all phylogenetic levels. The genera Fusobacterium, Fretibacterium, Streptococcus, Veillonella, Corynebacterium, TM7, and Filifactor were abundant in smokers. On the other hand, Prevotella, Campylobacter, Aggregatibacter, Veillonellaceae GQ422718, Haemophilus, and Prevotellaceae were less abundant in smokers. Among species-level taxa occupying > 1% of whole subgingival microbiome of smokers, higher abundance (>/= 2.0-fold compared to non-smokers) of seven species or operational taxonomic units (OTUs) was found: Fusobacterium nucleatum, Neisseria sicca, Neisseria oralis, Corynebacterium matruchotii, Veillonella dispar, Filifactor alocis, and Fretibacterium AY349371. On the other hand, lower abundance of 11 species or OTUs was found in smokers: Neisseria elongata, six Prevotella species or OTUs, Fusobacterium canifelinum, Aggregatibacter AM420165, Selenomonas OTU, and Veillonellaceae GU470897. Species richness and evenness were similar between the groups whereas diversity was greater in smokers than non-smokers. Collectively, the results of the present study indicate that differences exist in the subgingival bacterial community between smoker and non-smoker patients with chronic moderate periodontitis in Korea, suggesting that cigarette smoking considerably affects subgingival bacterial ecology.
TI  - Association between polycystic ovary syndrome, oral microbiota and systemic antibody responses.
AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disorder of women that not only is the leading cause of infertility but also shows a reciprocal link with oral health. This study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that the levels of putative periodontal pathogens in saliva and their antibody response in serum are elevated in PCOS, compared to systemic health. A total of 125 women were included in four groups; 45 women with PCOS and healthy periodontium, 35 women with PCOS and gingivitis, 25 systemically and periodontally healthy women, 20 systemically healthy women with gingivitis. Salivary levels of seven putative periodontal pathogens were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and serum antibody levels were analyzed by ELISA. In women with PCOS, salivary Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus oralis and Tannerella forsythia levels were higher than matched systemically healthy women, particularly in the case of gingivitis. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Treponema denticola levels were similar among study groups. The presence of PCOS also enhanced P. gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and S. oralis serum antibody levels, when gingivitis was also present. Gingival inflammation correlated positively with levels of the studied taxa in saliva, particularly in PCOS. The presence of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum in saliva also exhibited a strong positive correlation with the corresponding serum antibody levels. In conclusion, as an underlying systemic endocrine condition, PCOS may quantitatively affect the composition of oral microbiota and the raised systemic response to selective members of this microbial community, exerting a confounding role in resultant gingival inflammation and periodontal health. The most consistent effect appeared to be exerted on P. gingivalis.
TI  - An in vitro biofilm model associated to dental implants: structural and quantitative analysis of in vitro biofilm formation on different dental implant surfaces.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The impact of implant surfaces in dental biofilm development is presently unknown. The aim of this investigation was to assess in vitro the development of a complex biofilm model on titanium and zirconium implant surfaces, and to compare it with the same biofilm formed on hydroxyapatite surface. METHODS: Six standard reference strains were used to develop an in vitro biofilm over sterile titanium, zirconium and hydroxyapatite discs, coated with saliva within the wells of pre-sterilized polystyrene tissue culture plates. The selected species used represent initial (Streptococcus oralis and Actinomyces naeslundii), early (Veillonella parvula), secondary (Fusobacterium nucleatum) and late colonizers (Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). The developed biofilms (growth time 1 to 120h) were studied with confocal laser scanning microscopy using a vital fluorescence technique and with low-temperature scanning electron microscopy. The number (colony forming units/biofilm) and kinetics of the bacteria within the biofilm were studied with quantitative PCR (qPCR). As outcome variables, the biofilm thickness, the percentage of cell vitality and the number of bacteria were compared using the analysis of variance. RESULTS: The bacteria adhered and matured within the biofilm over the three surfaces with similar dynamics. Different surfaces, however, demonstrated differences both in the thickness, deposition of the extracellular polysaccharide matrix as well as in the organization of the bacterial cells. SIGNIFICANCE: While the formation and dynamics of an in vitro biofilm model was similar irrespective of the surface of inoculation (hydroxyapatite, titanium or zirconium), there were significant differences in regards to the biofilm thickness and three-dimensional structure.
TI  - Colonisation of gingival epithelia by subgingival biofilms in vitro: role of "red complex" bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Biofilm formation on tooth surface results in colonisation and invasion of the juxtaposed gingival tissue, eliciting strong inflammatory responses that lead to periodontal disease. This in vitro study investigated the colonisation of human gingival multi-layered epithelium by multi-species subgingival biofilms, and evaluated the relative effects of the "red complex" species (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia and Treponema denticola). METHODS: The grown biofilm consisted of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Veillonella dispar, P. gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, T. forsythia, T. denticola, Actinomyces oris, Streptococcus anginosus and Streptococcus oralis, or its variant lacking the "red complex". After 48h in co-culture with the gingival epithelia, the bacterial species in the biofilm were quantified, whereas their localisation on the cell surface was investigated by combining confocal-laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), as well as by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). RESULTS: Exclusion of the "red complex" quantitatively affected S. oralis, but not other species. The "red-complex" species were all able to colonise the gingival epithelial cells. A co-localisation trend was observed between P. gingivalis and T. denticola, as determined by FISH. However, in the absence of all three "red complex" bacteria from the biofilm, an immense colonisation of streptococci (potentially S. oralis) was observed on the gingival epithelia, as confirmed by both CLSM and SEM. CONCLUSIONS: While the "red complex" species synergise in colonizing gingival epithelia, their absence from the biofilm enhances streptococcal colonisation. This antagonism with streptococci reveals that the "red complex" may regulate biofilm virulence, with potential implications in periodontal pathogenesis.
TI  - Red wine and oenological extracts display antimicrobial effects in an oral bacteria biofilm model.
AB  - The antimicrobial effects of red wine and its inherent components on oral microbiota were studied by using a 5-species biofilm model of the supragingival plaque that includes Actinomyces oris, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mutans and Veillonella dispar. Microbiological analysis (CFU counting and confocal laser scanning microscopy) of the biofilms after the application of red wine, dealcoholized red wine, and red wine extract solutions spiked or not with grape seed and inactive dry yeast extracts showed that the solutions spiked with seed extract were effective against F. nucleatum, S. oralis and A. oris. Also, red wine and dealcoholized wine had an antimicrobial effect against F. nucleatum and S. oralis. Additional experiments showed almost complete and early degradation of flavan-3-ol precursors [(+)-catechin and procyanidin B2] when incubating biofilms with the red wine extract. To our knowledge, this is the first study of antimicrobial properties of wine in an oral biofilm model.
TI  - Salivary pellicle composition and multispecies biofilm developed on titanium nitrided by cold plasma.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the salivary  pellicle (SP) and multispecies biofilm developed on titanium nitrided by cold plasma. METHODS: Titanium discs were allocated into a control group (Ti) and an experimental group (TiN - titanium-nitrided by cold plasma). The disc surface topography was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The chemical composition of the disc surface was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Stimulated, clarified, and filtered saliva was used to form pellicles on the discs. Proteome analysis of the adsorbed SP proteins was performed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The surface free energy (SFE) was evaluated before and after SP formation. A multispecies biofilm composed of Actinomyces naeslundii, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mutans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Veillonella dispar, and Candida albicans was developed on the SP-coated discs. Viable microorganism counts were determined. The biomass and average thickness of biofilms were analyzed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM) with COMSTAT software. The biofilm organization was visualized by SEM. RESULTS: The surface topography was similar in both groups. The SFE of the TiN group did not differ from that of the Ti group (p>0.05), although the adsorption of pellicle proteins increased the SFE in both pellicle-coated groups (p<0.001). Different proteins were identified on the Ti and TiN surfaces. The amount of biofilm was similar for both groups (p=0.416), but the counts of F. nucleatum and S. oralis were higher in the TiN group (p<0.001). Similar biofilms were characterized by the COMSTAT data, CLSM images, and SEM images. CONCLUSION: The titanium nitrided by cold plasma exhibited differences in SP composition and multispecies microbial biofilm population compared to the control titanium surface.
TI  - Radiography-based score indicative for the pathogenicity of bacteria in odontogenic infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a new radiography-based score to assess the potential of bacteria to cause odontogenic infections derived from the occurrence of bacteria at small or large radiographical lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patients analyzed were a sub-population from a large randomized clinical trial comparing moxifloxacin and clindamycin in the treatment of inflammatory infiltrates and odontogenic abscesses. Routine radiographs were used to analyze the area of the periapical radiolucent lesions. Lesions were stratified by their radiographically measured area as large (>9 mm(2)) or small (</=9 mm(2)). A risk ratio was calculated for each species from the frequency of their occurrence in large vs in small lesions. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients, 19 with abscesses and 32 with infiltrates, were evaluated. Overall, the radiographical lesion areas ranged from 0.4-46.2 mm(2) (median = 9 mm(2)). An increased risk (risk ratio >1) to occur at large abscess lesions was observed for Prevotella (P.) oralis, P. buccae, P. oris, P. intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus (Strep.) anginosus group. An increased risk to occur at large infiltrate lesions was found for Strep. salivarius, Strep. parasanguis, Strep. anginosus group, Capnocytophaga spp., Neisseria (N.) sicca, Neisseria spp., Staphylococcus (Staph.) aureus, P. intermedia, P. buccae, Prevotella spp. and P. melaninogenica. CONCLUSIONS: The radiography-based score suggests that certain Prevotella spp., F. nucleatum and Strep. anginosus groups play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of odontogenic abscesses, and that various streptococci, Neisseria spp., Capnocytophaga spp., Staph. aureus and Prevotella spp. are involved in the pathogenesis of odontogenic infiltrates.
TI  - Impact of early colonizers on in vitro subgingival biofilm formation.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of early colonizing species on the structure and the composition of the bacterial community developing in a subgingival 10-species biofilm model system. The model included Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus anginosus, Actinomycesoris, Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, Veillonella dispar, Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola. Based on literature, we considered Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus anginosus, and Actinomyces oris as early colonizers and examined their role in the biofilms by either a delayed addition to the consortium, or by not inoculating at all the biofilms with these species. We quantitatively evaluated the resulting biofilms by real-time quantitative PCR and further compared the structures using confocal laser scanning microscopy following fluorescence in situ hybridisation. The absence of the early colonizers did not hinder biofilm formation. The biofilms reached the same total counts and developed to normal thickness. However, quantitative shifts in the abundances of individual species were observed. In the absence of streptococci, the overall biofilm structure appeared looser and more dispersed. Moreover, besides a significant increase of P. intermedia and a decrease of P. gingivalis , P. intermedia appeared to form filamented long chains that resembled streptococci. A. oris, although growing to significantly higher abundance in absence of streptococci, did not have a visible impact on the biofilms. Hence, in the absence of the early colonizers, there is a pronounced effect on P. intermedia and P. gingivalis that may cause distinct shifts in the structure of the biofilm. Streptococci possibly facilitate the establishment of P. gingivalis into subgingival biofilms, while in their absence P. intermedia became more dominant and forms elongated chains.
TI  - Differential effect of autoinducer 2 of Fusobacterium nucleatum on oral streptococci.
AB  - Autoinducer 2 (AI-2) is a quorum sensing molecule and plays an important role in  dental biofilm formation, mediating interspecies communication and virulence expression of oral bacteria. Fusobacterium nucleatum connects early colonizing commensals and late colonizing periodontopathogens. F. nucleatum AI-2 and quorum sensing inhibitors (QSIs) can manipulate dental biofilm formation. In this study, we evaluated the effect of F. nucleatum AI-2 and QSIs on biofilm formation of Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus oralis, which are initial colonizers in dental biofilm. F. nucleatum AI-2 significantly enhanced biofilm growth of S. gordonii and attachment of F. nucleatum to preformed S. gordonii biofilms. By contrast, F. nucleatum AI-2 reduced biofilm growth of S. oralis and attachment of F. nucleatum to preformed S. oralis biofilms. The QSIs, (5Z)-4-bromo-5-(bromomethylene)-2(5H)-furanone and d-ribose, reversed the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of AI-2 on S. gordonii and S. oralis, respectively. In addition, co-culture using a two-compartment system showed that secreted molecules of F. nucleatum had the same effect on biofilm growth of the streptococci as AI-2. Our results demonstrate that early colonizing bacteria can influence the accretion of F. nucleatum, a secondary colonizer, which ultimately influences the binding of periodontopathogens.
TI  - Characterization and application of a flow system for in vitro multispecies oral  biofilm formation.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Bacteria in the oral cavity grow in the form of biofilms; these structures are subject to constant saliva or gingival crevicular fluid flow conditions. The aims of this study were: (i) to develop and to characterize an in-vitro biofilm model with oral bacteria growing under flow and shear conditions; and (ii) to demonstrate the usefulness of the model for evaluating the activity of three antiplaque agents. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used a bioreactor to grow the oral bacteria Streptococcus oralis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Veillonella parvula, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis under planktonic conditions. Biofilms were established using a modified Robbins device on hydroxyapatite (HAP) discs. Three- to 7-d-old biofilms were analysed using culture methods, scanning electron microscopy, Live/Dead staining and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (confocal laser scanning microscopy). Finally, we assessed the antimicrobial activity of three mouthrinses [0.12% chlorhexidine (CHX), 0.12% chlorhexidine and sodium fluoride (CHX+NaF) and 0.12% chlorhexidine and 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride (CHX+CPC)] using a planktonic test (short interval-killing test) and in our 4-d biofilm model. RESULTS: The viable cell counts showed that each species was consistently found in the biofilms throughout the study. The architecture and cell distribution were similar to those described for biofilms in situ, with the exception of a thin layer of living cells that was found close to the HAP. The effectiveness test of the mouthwashes demonstrated that cells in biofilms showed more tolerance compared with planktonic cells. Moreover, it was observed that in 4-d biofilm formed in vitro, CHX+CPC caused significantly higher mortality compared with CHX (p = 0.003) and CHX+NaF (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that we have a highly reproducible system for multispecies oral biofilm formation and that it is a useful tool for assessing antibacterial molecules before their clinical evaluation. It also has great potential to be used in basic research on supragingival and subgingival biofilms.
TI  - Quantitative real-time PCR combined with propidium monoazide for the selective quantification of viable periodontal pathogens in an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Differentiation of live and dead cells is an important challenge when using molecular diagnosis for microbial identification. This is particularly relevant when bacteria have been exposed to antimicrobial agents. The objective of this study was to test a method using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) combined with propidium monoazide (PMA), developed for the selective quantification of viable P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum and total bacteria in an in vitro biofilm model after antimicrobial treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: PMA-qPCR method was tested in an in vitro biofilm model, using isopropyl alcohol as the antimicrobial agent. Matured biofilms were exposed for 1, 5, 10 and 30 min to isopropyl alcohol by immersion. Biofilms were disrupted and PMA added (final concentration of 100 mum). After DNA isolation, qPCR was carried out using specific primers and probes for the target bacteria. The differentiation of live and dead cells was tested by analysis of variance. RESULTS: When PMA was used in the presence of viable target bacterial cells, no statistically significant inhibition of qPCR amplification was detected (p > 0.05 in all cases). Conversely, after immersion in isopropyl alcohol of the biofilm, PMA resulted in a significant total reduction of qPCR amplification of about 4 log10 . P. gingivalis showed a vitality reduction in the biofilm of 3 log10 , while A. actinomycetemcomitans and F. nucleatum showed a 2 log10 reduction. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate the efficiency of PMA for differentiating viable and dead P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans and F. nucleatum cells, as well as total bacteria, in an in vitro biofilm model, after being exposed to an antimicrobial agent. Hence, this PMA-qPCR method may be useful for studying the effect of antimicrobial agents aimed at oral biofilms.
TI  - Oral epithelial cell responses to multispecies microbial biofilms.
AB  - This report describes the use of a novel model of multispecies biofilms to stimulate profiles of cytokines/chemokines from oral epithelial cells that contribute to local inflammation in the periodontium. Streptococcus gordonii (Sg)/S. oralis (So)/S. sanguinis (Ss) and Sg/Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn)/Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) biofilms elicited significantly elevated levels of IL-1alpha and showed synergistic stimulatory activity compared with an additive effect of the 3 individual bacteria. Only the Sg/Actinomyces naeslundii (An)/Fn multispecies biofilms elicited IL-6 levels above those of control. IL-8 was a primary response to the Sg/An/Fn biofilms, albeit the level was not enhanced compared with a predicted composite level from the monospecies challenges. These results represent some of the first data documenting alterations in profiles of oral epithelial cell responses to multispecies biofilms.
TI  - Method to quantify live and dead cells in multi-species oral biofilm by real-time PCR with propidium monoazide.
AB  - Real-time PCR (qPCR) is a widely used technique in analysing environmental and clinical microbiological samples. However, its main limitation was its inability to discriminate between live and dead cells.Recently, propidium monoazide (PMA) together with qPCR has been used to overcome this problem, with good results for different bacterial species in different types of samples.Our objective was to implement this technique for analysing mortality in multi-species oral biofilms formed in vitro with five oral bacteria: Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus gordonii, Veillonella parvula, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia. We also tested its effectiveness on biofilms treated with an antiseptic solution containing 0.07% w/w cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC).Standardisation of the qPCR-PMA method was performed on pure, heat-killed planktonic cultures of each species, detecting mortality higher than 4 log in S. oralis, S. gordonii and F. nucleatum and higher than 2 for V. parvula and P. intermedia. We obtained similar results for all species when using CPC.When we analysed biofilms with qPCR-PMA, we found that the mortality in the non-CPC treated multi-species biofilms was lower than 1 log for all species. After treatment with CPC, the viability reduction was higher than 4 log in S. oralis and S. gordonii, higher than 3 log in F. nucleatum and P. intermedia and approximately 2 in V. parvula.In short, we standardised the conditions for using qPCR-PMA in 5 oral bacterial species and proved its usefulness for quantification of live and dead cells in multi-species oral biofilms formed in vitro, after use of an antiseptic.
TI  - Validation of a quantitative real-time PCR assay and comparison with fluorescence microscopy and selective agar plate counting for species-specific quantification of an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Subgingival biofilms are the prime etiological factor of periodontal disease. Owing to their complex polymicrobial nature, quantification of individual bacterial species within the biofilm for research and diagnostic purposes can be methodologically challenging. The aims of this study were to establish a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay to quantify the bacteria used in our 10-species in vitro 'subgingival' biofilm model and to compare the quantitative outcome with fluorescence microscopy and colony-forming unit (CFU) counts on selective agar plates. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The 10 species included in the in vitro biofilm were Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus anginosus, Veillonella dispar, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, Actinomyces oris, Campylobacter rectus, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia. The numbers of each species were quantified at two time points using qPCR, microscopy counting following fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) or immunofluorescence staining, and counting of CFUs after growth on selective agar plates. RESULTS: All 10 species were successfully quantified using qPCR and FISH or immunofluorescence, and the eight species culturable on selective agar plates were also quantified by counting the numbers of CFUs after growth on selective agar. In early biofilm cultures, all methods showed a significant correlation, although the absolute numbers differed between methods. In late biofilm cultures, measurements obtained using qPCR and FISH or immunofluorescence, but not by CFU counts, maintained significant correlation. CFU counts yielded lower values than did measurements made using the other two methods. CONCLUSION: Quantitative PCR and epifluorescence microscopy can be easily combined with each other to determine species-specific bacterial numbers within biofilms. However, conventional bacterial cultures cannot be as efficiently combined using these molecular detection methods. This may be crucial in designing and selecting appropriate clinical diagnostic methods for subgingival biofilm samples.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of blackberry extract target periodontopathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Antimicrobial agents provide valuable adjunctive therapy for the prevention and the control of oral diseases. Limitations in their prolonged use have stimulated the search for new, naturally occurring agents with more specific activity and fewer adverse effects. Here we sought to determine the antibacterial properties of blackberry extract (BBE) in vitro against oral bacterial commensals and periodontopathogens. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The effects of whole and fractionated BBE on the metabolism of 10 different oral bacteria were evaluated using the colorimetric water-soluble tetrazolium-1 assay. The bactericidal effects of whole BBE against Fusobacterium nucleatum were determined by quantitating the numbers of colony-forming units (CFUs). Cytotoxicity was determined in oral epithelial (OKF6) cells. RESULTS: BBE at 350-1400 mug/mL reduced the metabolic activity of Porphyromonas gingivalis, F. nucleatum and Streptococcus mutans. The reduced metabolic activity observed for F. nucleatum corresponded to a reduction in the numbers of CFUs following exposure to BBE for as little as 1 h, indicative of its bactericidal properties. An anthocyanin-enriched fraction of BBE reduced the metabolic activity of F. nucleatum, but not of P. gingivalis or S. mutans, suggesting the contribution of species-specific agents in the whole BBE. Oral epithelial cell viability was not reduced following exposure to whole BBE (2.24-1400 mug/mL) for </= 6 h. CONCLUSION: BBE alters the metabolic activity of oral periodontopathogens while demonstrating a minimal effect on commensals. The specific antibacterial properties of BBE shown in this study, along with its previously demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties, make this natural extract a promising target as an adjunct for prevention and/or complementary therapy of periodontal infections.
TI  - Shifts in the microbial population in relation to in situ caries progression.
AB  - The shift in microbial diversity from young to mature plaque, related to caries activity on sound and restored surfaces, was studied using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. During a 20-week in situ study on caries progression 8 subjects wearing restored and unrestored dentin and enamel sections, biofilm was sampled after 1 and 20 weeks (young or mature plaque). A higher microbial diversity (mature plaque) was seen in caries-active compared to caries-free subjects. Rothia dentocariosa and Scardovia inopinata were absent from all caries-free sites, but appeared in 50% of the caries-active sites.
TI  - Using high throughput sequencing to explore the biodiversity in oral bacterial communities.
AB  - High throughput sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicons is a cost-effective method for characterization of oral bacterial communities. However, before undertaking large-scale studies, it is necessary to understand the technique-associated limitations and intrinsic variability of the oral ecosystem. In this work we evaluated bias in species representation using an in vitro-assembled mock community of oral bacteria. We then characterized the bacterial communities in saliva and buccal mucosa of five healthy subjects to investigate the power of high throughput sequencing in revealing their diversity and biogeography patterns. Mock community analysis showed primer and DNA isolation biases and an overestimation of diversity that was reduced after eliminating singleton operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Sequencing of salivary and mucosal communities found a total of 455 OTUs (0.3% dissimilarity) with only 78 of these present in all subjects. We demonstrate that this variability was partly the result of incomplete richness coverage even at great sequencing depths, and so comparing communities by their structure was more effective than comparisons based solely on membership. With respect to oral biogeography, we found inter-subject variability in community structure was lower than site differences between salivary and mucosal communities within subjects. These differences were evident at very low sequencing depths and were mostly caused by the abundance of Streptococcus mitis and Gemella haemolysans in mucosa. In summary, we present an experimental and data analysis framework that will facilitate design and interpretation of pyrosequencing-based studies. Despite challenges associated with this technique, we demonstrate its power for evaluation of oral diversity and biogeography patterns.
TI  - Comparison of microbial changes in early redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surfaces and fluids can affect oral bacterial colonization. The aim of this study is to compare redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures. METHODS: Supragingival plaque samples were taken from 55 dentate individuals and the denture teeth of 62 edentulous individuals before and after professional cleaning. Also, samples from seven "teeth" (samples included dentures) in randomly selected quadrants were collected after 1, 2, 4, and 7 days of no oral hygiene. Samples were analyzed using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Counts and proportions of 41 bacterial taxa were determined at each time point, and significant differences were determined using the Mann-Whitney U test. Ecological succession was determined using a modified moving window analysis. RESULTS: Mean total DNA probe counts were similar precleaning but were higher in dentate individuals at all post-cleaning visits (P <0.01). Precleaning edentate biofilms had higher counts and proportions of Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus mutans, whereas dentate individuals had higher proportions of Tannerella forsythia, Selenomonas noxia, and Neisseria mucosa. By day 2, mean counts of all taxa were higher in natural teeth, and most remained higher at day 7 (P <0.01). Succession was more rapid and complex in dentate individuals. Both groups demonstrated increased proportions of S. mitis and S. oralis by day 1. N. mucosa, Veillonella parvula, and Eikenella corrodens increased in both groups, but later in samples from edentate individuals. CONCLUSIONS: "Mature" natural and denture teeth biofilms have similar total numbers of bacteria but different species proportions. Post-cleaning biofilm redevelopment is more rapid and more complex on natural teeth than on denture teeth.
TI  - Molecular analysis of 16S rRNA genes identifies potentially periodontal pathogenic bacteria and archaea in the plaque of partially erupted third molars.
AB  - PURPOSE: Small subunit rRNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were used to identify cultivable and uncultivable microorganisms present in the dental plaque of symptomatic and asymptomatic partially erupted third molars to determine the prevalence of putative periodontal pathogens in pericoronal sites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Template DNA prepared from subgingival plaque collected from partially erupted symptomatic and asymptomatic mandibular third molars and healthy incisors was used in polymerase chain reaction with broad-range oligonucleotide primers to amplify 16S rRNA bacterial and archaeal genes. Amplicons were cloned, sequenced, and compared with known nucleotide sequences in online databases to identify the microorganisms present. RESULTS: Two thousand three hundred two clones from the plaque of 12 patients carried bacterial sequences from 63 genera belonging to 11 phyla, including members of the uncultivable TM7, SR1, and Chloroflexi, and difficult-to-cultivate Synergistetes and Spirochaetes. Dialister invisus, Filifactor alocis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella denticola, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola, which have been associated with periodontal disease, were found in significantly greater abundance in pericoronal compared with incisor sites. Dialister invisus and F nucleatum were found in greater abundance in sites exhibiting clinical symptoms. The archaeal species, Methanobrevibacter oralis, which has been associated with severe periodontitis, was found in 3 symptomatic patients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings have provided new insights into the complex microbiota of pericoronitis. Several bacterial and archaeal species implicated in periodontal disease were recovered in greater incidence and abundance from the plaque of partially erupted third molars compared with incisors, supporting the hypothesis that the pericoronal region may provide a favored niche for periodontal pathogens in otherwise healthy mouths.
TI  - Oral microbial biofilm stimulation of epithelial cell responses.
AB  - Oral bacterial biofilms trigger chronic inflammatory responses in the host that can result in the tissue destructive events of periodontitis. However, the characteristics of the capacity of specific host cell types to respond to these biofilms remain ill-defined. This report describes the use of a novel model of bacterial biofilms to stimulate oral epithelial cells and profile select cytokines and chemokines that contribute to the local inflammatory environment in the periodontium. Monoinfection biofilms were developed with Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus gordonii, Actinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis on rigid gas-permeable contact lenses. Biofilms, as well as planktonic cultures of these same bacterial species, were incubated under anaerobic conditions with a human oral epithelial cell line, OKF4, for up to 24h. Gro-1alpha, IL1alpha, IL-6, IL-8, TGFalpha, Fractalkine, MIP-1alpha, and IP-10 were shown to be produced in response to a range of the planktonic or biofilm forms of these species. P. gingivalis biofilms significantly inhibited the production of all of these cytokines and chemokines, except MIP-1alpha. Generally, the biofilms of all species inhibited Gro-1alpha, TGFalpha, and Fractalkine production, while F. nucleatum biofilms stimulated significant increases in IL-1alpha, IL-6, IL-8, and IP-10. A. naeslundii biofilms induced elevated levels of IL-6, IL-8 and IP-10. The oral streptococcal species in biofilms or planktonic forms were poor stimulants for any of these mediators from the epithelial cells. The results of these studies demonstrate that oral bacteria in biofilms elicit a substantially different profile of responses compared to planktonic bacteria of the same species. Moreover, certain oral species are highly stimulatory when in biofilms and interact with host cell receptors to trigger pathways of responses that appear quite divergent from individual bacteria.
TI  - Subgingival microbiota in adult Down syndrome periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The subgingival microbiota in Down syndrome and non-Down syndrome adults receiving periodic dental care was examined for 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization and the results were related to clinical periodontal attachment loss. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 44 Down syndrome, 66 non-Down syndrome mentally retarded and 83 mentally normal adults were clinically evaluated. This involved, for each subject, the removal of subgingival specimens from three interproximal sites on different teeth; all subgingival samples per subject were then pooled and assessed for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial species using species-specific whole-genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Significant group differences in species proportions averaged across subjects were evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis test, and associations between subgingival species and mean subject attachment loss within Down syndrome and non-Down syndrome subject groups were quantified using Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Down syndrome subjects exhibited greater attachment loss than non-Down syndrome subjects (p=0.05). Most microbial species were present in Down syndrome subjects at levels similar to non-Down syndrome subjects, except for higher proportions of Selenomonas noxia, Propionibacterium acnes, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus oralis in Down syndrome subjects compared with non-Down syndrome study subjects, higher proportions of Treponema socranskii in Down syndrome subjects compared with non-Down syndrome mentally retarded subjects, and higher proportions of Streptococcus constellatus in Down syndrome subjects compared with mentally normal subjects. Down syndrome adults classified with periodontitis revealed higher subgingival levels of T. socranskii than Down syndrome subjects with no periodontitis (p=0.02). Higher subgingival proportions of S. constellatus, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, S. noxia and Prevotella nigrescens showed significant positive correlations (r=0.35-0.42) and higher proportions of Actinomyces naeslundii II and Actinomyces odontolyticus showed negative correlations (r=-0.36 to -0.40), with increasing mean subject attachment loss in Down syndrome adults. CONCLUSION: Individuals with Down syndrome show higher levels of some subgingival bacterial species and specific associations between certain subgingival bacterial species and loss of periodontal attachment. These findings are consistent with the notion that certain subgingival bacteria may contribute to the increased level of periodontal disease seen in Down syndrome individuals and raise the question as to the reason for increased colonization in Down syndrome.
TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy of denture adhesives on some oral malodor-related microbes.
AB  - The objective of the study was to determine the antimicrobial efficacy of three denture adhesives toward Streptococcus oralis, mutans, Prevotella oralis and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Adhesives used were Corega Ultra((R)), Fixodent Pro Original((R)) and Biotene((R)) Denture Grip. For Streptococcus oralis and Streptococcus mutans, four tubes of Trypticase Soy Broth 10 mL and 1 g denture of adhesive were used. In addition four tubes of Trypticase Soy Broth 10 mL without any denture adhesive was employed as control. For Prevotella oralis and Fusobacterium nucleatum, four tubes of thioglycolate 10 mL and 1 g denture adhesive were used for each one, while four tubes of thioglycolate 10 mL without adhesive served as control. All samples were incubated for 48 h at 37 degrees C. After 48 h, the number of colonies was counted and the mean was extracted as cfu/mL. The results were evaluated with ANOVA on ranked data and Tukey's post hoc test at alpha = 0.05. Streptococcus oralis, mutans, Prevotella oralis and Fusobacterium nucleatum showed decreased number of colonies for each denture adhesive compared to the control. Under the conditions of this in vitro study, all the tested denture adhesives showed antimicrobial efficacy. However, in contrast to the hypothesis, there were differences among them. Corega Ultra((R)) and Biotene((R)) Denture Grip were more effective for all the tested oral malodor-related microbes than Fixodent Pro Original((R)).
TI  - Multispecies communities: interspecies interactions influence growth on saliva as sole nutritional source.
AB  - Human oral bacteria live in multispecies communities in the biofilm called dental plaque. This review focuses on the interactions of seven species and the ability of each species individually and together with other species to grow on saliva as the sole source of nutrient. Community formation in biofilms in flow cells is monitored using species-specific fluorophore-conjugated immunoglobulin G, and images are captured by confocal microscopy. Early colonizing veillonellae emerge from this review of interspecies interactions in saliva as a critical genus that guides the development of multispecies communities. Highly selective interspecies recognition is evident as initial colonizers pair with early and middle colonizers to form multispecies communities that grow on saliva.
TI  - Novel model for multispecies biofilms that uses rigid gas-permeable lenses.
AB  - Oral biofilms comprise complex multispecies consortia aided by specific inter- and intraspecies interactions occurring among commensals and pathogenic bacterial species. Oral biofilms are primary initiating factors of periodontal disease, although complex multifactorial biological influences, including host cell responses, contribute to the individual outcome of the disease. To provide a system to study initial stages of interaction between oral biofilms and the host cells that contribute to the disease process, we developed a novel in vitro model system to grow biofilms on rigid gas-permeable contact lenses (RGPLs), which enable oxygen to permeate through the lens material. Bacterial species belonging to early- and late-colonizing groups were successfully established as single- or three-species biofilms, with each group comprising Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus sanguinis; S. gordonii, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Fusobacterium nucleatum; or S. gordonii, F. nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Quantification of biofilm numbers by quantitative PCR (qPCR) revealed substantial differences in the magnitude of bacterial numbers in single-species and multispecies biofilms. We evaluated cell-permeable conventional nucleic acid stains acridine orange, hexidium iodide, and Hoechst 33258 and novel SYTO red, blue, and green fluorochromes for their effect on bacterial viability and fluorescence yield to allow visualization of the aggregates of individual bacterial species by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Substantial differences in the quantity and distribution of the species in the multispecies biofilms were identified. The specific features of these biofilms may help us better understand the role of various bacteria in local challenge of oral tissues.
TI  - Clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  - It has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. It is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. To investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the DNA-DNA hybridization technique. Actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. Factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for T. forsythia, Campylobacter rectus, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens, Parvimonas micra, and Treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of A. oris, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Eikenella corrodens, Streptococcus intermedius, Selenomonas noxia, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Veillonella parvula. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while Fusobacterium nucleatum loaded on both. These findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.
TI  - The effect of xylitol on the composition of the oral flora: a pilot study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the microbial composition of plaque and saliva. METHODS: Twelve volunteers (22-38 yrs) harboring mutans streptococci (MS) participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. The experimental chewing gum contained 65% xylitol while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol and 2% maltitol w/w. The polyol dose was approximately 6 g/day. Stimulated saliva and plaque samples were collected before and after the two four-week test periods. The samples were cultured for MS, total streptococci, lactobacilli, and total facultatives. A part of the samples were subjected to DNA-DNA hybridizations of 14 microbial plaque species: Actinomyces naeslundii, A. viscosus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. fermentum, L. paracasei, L. rhamnose, L. plantarum, Streptococcus gordonii, S. oralis, S. parasanguis, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis, Veillonella parvula. RESULTS: The MS counts of the plaque samples collected from "caries-prone" tooth sites decreased significantly (P<.01) in the xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. Also the plaque MS percentage decreased significantly in the xylitol gum group (P<.01). The salivary MS counts did not decrease either in the xylitol or in the sorbitol gum groups. Nor were changes detected in the salivary levels of total streptococci or lactobacilli. The DNA-DNA hybridization assay revealed no study-induced changes in the microbial composition of the dental plaque. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this pilot study, xylitol consumption reduced MS counts in plaque but appeared not to affect the microbial composition of plaque or saliva in general.
TI  - Structure, viability and bacterial kinetics of an in vitro biofilm model using six bacteria from the subgingival microbiota.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: There are few in vitro models available in the scientific literature for study of the structure, formation and development of the subgingival biofilm. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate an in vitro biofilm model, using representative selected bacteria from the subgingival microbiota. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Six standard reference strains were used to develop biofilms over sterile ceramic calcium hydroxyapatite discs coated with saliva within the wells of presterilized polystyrene tissue culture plates. The selected species represent initial (Streptococcus oralis and Actinomyces naeslundii), early (Veillonella parvula), secondary (Fusobacterium nucleatum) and late colonizers (Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). The structure of the biofilm obtained was studied using a vital fluorescence technique in conjunction with confocal laser scanning microscopy. The biofilm bacterial kinetics were studied by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. RESULTS: After 12 h, initial and early colonizers were the first microorganisms detected adhering to the calcium hydroxyapatite discs. The intermediate colonizer F. nucleatum was not detected in the model until 24 h of incubation. Late colonizers A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis could be measured inside the biofilm after 48 h. The biofilm reached its steady state between 72 and 96 h after inoculation, with bacterial vitality increasing from the hydroxyapatite surface to the central part of the biofilm. CONCLUSION: An in vitro biofilm model was developed and validated, demonstrating a pattern of bacterial colonization and maturation similar to the in vivo development of the subgingival biofilm.
TI  - Effect of biofilm on the repair bond strengths of composites.
AB  - Composite restorations degrade during wear, but it is unknown how wear affects the composite surface and influences composite-to-composite bonding in minimally invasive repair. Here, it is hypothesized that in vitro exposure of composites to oral biofilm yields clinically relevant degradation of composite surfaces, and its influence on composite-to-composite bonding is determined. Biofilms on composite surfaces in vitro increased their roughness and decreased filler particle exposure, except for a microhybrid composite, similar to effects of clinical wear in palatal appliances. Failure shear stresses after intermediate-adhesive-resin application were significantly lower after aging by in vitro exposure to biofilms, while silica-coating maintained the same failure stress levels as in non-aged composites. Failure modes were predominantly cohesive after silica-coating, while intermediate-adhesive-resin application yielded more adhesive failure. It is concluded that in vitro exposure to oral biofilm is a clinically relevant aging condition, and that silica-coating is to be preferred for the repair of aged composites.
TI  - Potential of shock waves to remove calculus and biofilm.
AB  - Effective calculus and biofilm removal is essential to treat periodontitis. Sonic and ultrasonic technologies are used in several scaler applications. This was the first feasibility study to assess the potential of a shock wave device to remove calculus and biofilms and to kill bacteria. Ten extracted teeth with visible subgingival calculus were treated with either shock waves for 1 min at an energy output of 0.4 mJ/mm(2) at 3 Hz or a magnetostrictive ultrasonic scaler at medium power setting for 1 min, which served as a control. Calculus was determined before and after treatment planimetrically using a custom-made software using a grey scale threshold. In a second experiment, multispecies biofilms were formed on saliva-preconditioned bovine enamel discs during 64.5 h. They were subsequently treated with shock waves or the ultrasonic scaler (N = 6/group) using identical settings. Biofilm detachment and bactericidal effects were then assessed. Limited efficiency of the shock wave therapy in terms of calculus removal was observed: only 5% of the calculus was removed as compared to 100% when ultrasound was used (P </= 0.0001). However, shock waves were able to significantly reduce adherent bacteria by three orders of magnitude (P </= 0.0001). The extent of biofilm removal by the ultrasonic device was statistically similar. Only limited bactericidal effects were observed using both methods. Within the limitations of this preliminary study, the shock wave device was not able to reliably remove calculus but had the potential to remove biofilms by three log steps. To increase the efficacy, technical improvements are still required. This novel noninvasive intervention, however, merits further investigation.
TI  - Mechanical non-surgical treatment of peri-implantitis: a single-blinded randomized longitudinal clinical study. II. Microbiological results.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Peri-implantitis is common in patients with dental implants. We performed a single-blinded longitudinal randomized study to assess the effects of mechanical debridement on the peri-implant microbiota in peri-implantitis lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An expanded checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization assay encompassing 79 different microorganisms was used to study bacterial counts before and during 6 months following mechanical treatment of peri-implantitis in 17 cases treated with curettes and 14 cases treated with an ultrasonic device. Statistics included non-parametric tests and GLM multivariate analysis with p<0001 indicating significance and 80% power. RESULTS: At selected implant test sites, the most prevalent bacteria were: Fusobacterium nucleatum sp., Staphylococci sp., Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Helicobacter pylori, and Tannerella forsythia. 30 min. after treatment with curettes, A. actinomycetemcomitans (serotype a), Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus anginosus, and Veillonella parvula were found at lower counts (p<0.001). No such differences were found for implants treated with the ultrasonic device. Inconsistent changes occurred following the first week. No microbiological differences between baseline and 6-month samples were found for any species or between treatment study methods in peri-implantitis. CONCLUSIONS: Both methods failed to eliminate or reduce bacterial counts in peri-implantitis. No group differences were found in the ability to reduce the microbiota in peri-implantitis.
TI  - Central role of the early colonizer Veillonella sp. in establishing multispecies  biofilm communities with initial, middle, and late colonizers of enamel.
AB  - Human dental biofilm communities comprise several species, which can interact cooperatively or competitively. Bacterial interactions influence biofilm formation, metabolic changes, and physiological function of the community. Lactic acid, a common metabolite of oral bacteria, was measured in the flow cell effluent of one-, two- and three-species communities growing on saliva as the sole nutritional source. We investigated single-species and multispecies colonization by using known initial, early, middle, and late colonizers of enamel. Fluorescent-antibody staining and image analysis were used to quantify the biomass in saliva-fed flow cells. Of six species tested, only the initial colonizer Actinomyces oris exhibited significant growth. The initial colonizer Streptococcus oralis produced lactic acid but showed no significant growth. The early colonizer Veillonella sp. utilized lactic acid in two- and three-species biofilm communities. The biovolumes of all two-species biofilms increased when Veillonella sp. was present as one of the partners, indicating that this early colonizer promotes mutualistic community development. All three-species combinations exhibited enhanced growth except one, i.e., A. oris, Veillonella sp., and the middle colonizer Porphyromonas gingivalis, indicating specificity among three-species communities. Further specificity was seen when Fusobacterium nucleatum (a middle colonizer), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a late colonizer), and P. gingivalis did not grow with S. oralis in two-species biofilms, but inclusion of Veillonella sp. resulted in growth of all three-species combinations. We propose that commensal veillonellae use lactic acid for growth in saliva and that they communicate metabolically with initial, early, middle, and late colonizers to establish multispecies communities on enamel.
TI  - Mutualistic biofilm communities develop with Porphyromonas gingivalis and initial, early, and late colonizers of enamel.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is present in dental plaque as early as 4 h after tooth  cleaning, but it is also associated with periodontal disease, a late-developing event in the microbial successions that characterize daily plaque development. We report here that P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 is remarkable in its ability to interact with a variety of initial, early, middle, and late colonizers growing solely on saliva. Integration of P. gingivalis into multispecies communities was investigated by using two in vitro biofilm models. In flow cells, bacterial growth was quantified using fluorescently conjugated antibodies against each species, and static biofilm growth on saliva-submerged polystyrene pegs was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR using species-specific primers. P. gingivalis could not grow as a single species or together with initial colonizer Streptococcus oralis but showed mutualistic growth when paired with two other initial colonizers, Streptococcus gordonii and Actinomyces oris, as well as with Veillonella sp. (early colonizer), Fusobacterium nucleatum (middle colonizer), and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (late colonizer). In three-species flow cells, P. gingivalis grew with Veillonella sp. and A. actinomycetemcomitans but not with S. oralis and A. actinomycetemcomitans. Also, it grew with Veillonella sp. and F. nucleatum but not with S. oralis and F. nucleatum, indicating that P. gingivalis and S. oralis are not compatible. However, P. gingivalis grew in combination with S. gordonii and S. oralis, demonstrating its ability to overcome the incompatibility when cultured with a second initially colonizing species. Collectively, these data help explain the observed presence of P. gingivalis at all stages of dental plaque development.
TI  - Multi-species biofilm formation on dental materials and an adhesive patch.
AB  - PURPOSE: This laboratory study assessed the influence of surface roughness and contact time on the formation of a multi-species biofilm on dental materials (adhesive patch, composite, amalgam and enamel). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rough and smooth specimens of each material were prepared and the mean surface roughness was assessed profilometrically. The biofilms were then allowed to grow either for 15 min or 15 h respectively on saliva-preconditioned specimens of each material, and colony-forming units on blood agar were counted (N = 9/group) Surface morphology was assessed using a scanning electron microscope. RESULTS: No difference was found in the biofilm formation rate among all the materials that were tested. After a short incubation period, a statistical significant difference between smooth and rough samples could be detected on amalgam and on the resin composite material (P < or = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Surface roughness may influence the initial biofilm adherence, but differences vanish following growth and maturation. The multi-species biofilm offers a reliable laboratory model for studying plaque formation.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953 requires Actinomyces naeslundii ATCC 43146 for growth on saliva in a three-species community that includes Streptococcus oralis 34.
AB  - Formation of dental plaque is a developmental process involving initial and late  colonizing species that form polymicrobial communities. Fusobacteria are the most numerous gram-negative bacteria in dental plaque, but they become prevalent after the initial commensal colonizers, such as streptococci and actinomyces, have established communities. The unusual ability of these bacteria to coaggregate with commensals, as well as pathogenic late colonizers, has been proposed to facilitate colonization by the latter organisms. We investigated the integration of Fusobacterium nucleatum into multispecies communities by employing two in vitro models with saliva as the sole nutritional source. In flow cell biofilms, numbers of cells were quantified using fluorescently conjugated antibodies against each species, and static biofilms were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (q-PCR) using species-specific primers. Unable to grow as single-species biofilms, F. nucleatum grew in two-species biofilms with Actinomyces naeslundii but not with Streptococcus oralis. However, enhanced growth of fusobacteria was observed in three-species biofilms, indicating that there was multispecies cooperation. Importantly, these community dynamics yielded an 18-fold increase in the F. nucleatum biomass between 4 h and 18 h in the flow cell inoculated with three species. q-PCR analysis of static biofilms revealed that maximum growth of the three species occurred at 24 h to 36 h. Lower numbers of cells were observed at 48 h, suggesting that saliva could not support higher cell densities as the sole nutrient. Integration of F. nucleatum into multispecies commensal communities was evident from the interdigitation of fusobacteria in coaggregates with A. naeslundii and S. oralis and from the improved growth of fusobacteria, which was dependent on the presence of A. naeslundii.
TI  - An in vitro evaluation of hydrolytic enzymes as dental plaque control agents.
AB  - The plaque-control potential of commercially available amylase, lipase and protease was evaluated by observing their effects on coaggregation and on bacterial viability within various plaque microcosms. A quantitative coaggregation assay indicated that protease significantly inhibited the extent of coaggregation of Actinomyces naeslundii and Streptococcus oralis (P <0.05) and of Porphyromonas gingivalis and S. oralis. Amylase significantly (P <0.05) increased the coaggregation of A. naeslundii versus Fusobacterium nucleatum and A. naeslundii versus P. gingivalis. Concomitant challenge of constant-depth film fermenter-grown plaques with the enzymes did not result in detectable ecological perturbations (assessed by differential culture and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis). Similar dosing and analysis of multiple Sorbarod devices did not reveal increases in bacterial dispersion which could result from disaggregation of extant plaques. A short-term hydroxyapatite colonization model was therefore used to investigate possible enzyme effects on early-stage plaque development. Whilst culture did not indicate significant reductions in adhesion or plaque accumulation, a vital visual assay revealed significantly increased aggregation frequency following enzyme exposure. In summary, although hydrolytic enzymes negatively influenced binary coaggregation, they did not cause statistically significant changes in bacterial viability within plaque microcosms. In contrast, enzyme exposure increased aggregation within extant plaques.
TI  - Does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. METHODS: Bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (BOP) was recorded at sites sampled at the four time points. RESULTS: The mean BOP at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. The corresponding mean BOP at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). Total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (P <0.01). Increased bacterial counts over time were found for Neisseria mucosa (P <0.001). Lower counts (P <0.001) were found for Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eubacterium saburreum, Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, Fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, Leptotrichia buccalis, Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Selenomonas noxia, and Veillonella parvula. No changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. Counts of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), and Treponema denticola did not change. Counts of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. P. gingivalis and T. forsythia counts were associated with BOP at week 12. A decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. Only counts of N. mucosa increased.
TI  - Tinidazole inhibitory and cidal activity against anaerobic periodontal pathogens.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tinidazole against anaerobic periodontal pathogens (25 Prevotella buccae, 18 Prevotella denticola, 10 Prevotella intermedia, 6 Prevotella melaninogenica, 5 Prevotella oralis, 10 Fusobacterium nucleatum and 8 Veillonella spp.) was determined by agar dilution. MIC(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms) were 8 microg/mL for Veillonella spp., 4 microg/mL for P. intermedia, 2 microg/mL for P. buccae, 1 microg/mL for Fusobacterium spp. and 0.5 microg/mL for other Prevotella spp. Cidal activity was studied by killing curves with tinidazole and amoxicillin (alone and in combination) at concentrations similar to those achieved in crevicular fluid (41.2 microg/mL tinidazole and 14.05 microg/mL amoxicillin) against an inoculum of ca. 10(7)colony-forming units/mL of four bacterial groups, each one composed of four different strains of the following periodontal isolates: Prevotella spp., Fusobacterium spp. and Veillonella spp. (anaerobes) and one amoxicillin-susceptible Streptococcus spp. (facultative) in a proportion of 1:1:1:1. When only beta-lactamase-negative Prevotella or Fusobacterium strains were tested, significantly higher reductions were found with amoxicillin (>4 log reduction at 48 h) versus controls. The presence of beta-lactamase-positive Prevotella spp. or F. nucleatum strains rendered amoxicillin inactive (no reductions at 48 h), with no differences from controls. Amoxicillin+tinidazole produced >3 log reduction at 24h and >4 log reduction at 48 h regardless of the presence or not of beta-lactamase-positive strains. The presence in crevicular fluid of beta-lactamases produced by beta-lactamase-positive periodontal pathogens may have ecological and therapeutic consequences since it may protect beta-lactamase-negative periodontal pathogens from amoxicillin treatment. In vitro, tinidazole offered high antianaerobic activity against beta-lactamase-positive and -negative periodontal pathogens, avoiding amoxicillin inactivation.
TI  - Streptococcus cristatus attenuates Fusobacterium nucleatum-induced interleukin-8  expression in oral epithelial cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Oral epithelial cells may be invaded by a polymicrobial intracellular flora, including pathogens together with commensals. Various oral pathogens can induce the production of interleukin-8, a potent neutrophil chemotractant, in oral epithelial cells. Evidence from the gut suggests that commensal species may modulate inflammatory responses to pathogens. The aim of this study was to examine the interleukin-8 responses of oral epithelial cells to an oral pro-inflammatory species, Fusobacterium nucleatum, in combination with an oral commensal, Streptococcus cristatus. MATERIAL AND METHODS: KB, TERT-2, TR146 and SCC15 cells were cocultured with F. nucleatum and S. cristatus, either alone or in combination, at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 under various conditions. The mRNA expression of interleukin-8 was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: F. nucleatum alone evoked a potent interleukin-8 response, whereas S. cristatus alone did not induce significant interleukin-8 expression in oral epithelial cells. When present together, S. cristatus attenuated the F. nucleatum-induced interleukin-8 production in the four oral epithelial cell lines to varying degrees. The inhibitory effect of S. cristatus was independent of its viability and its co-aggregation with F. nucleatum, was not related to soluble bacterial products and appeared to require bacterial contact with epithelial cells. Similar effects were seen with several other species of oral streptococci. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that S. cristatus may exert immunomodulatory effects on the interleukin-8 response of oral epithelial cells to F. nucleatum challenge.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the effect of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine on oral microorganisms.
AB  - The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effects of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine on the viability of some oral bacterial species. It also evaluated the ability of these bacteria to metabolize those substances. Single-species biofilms of Streptococcus gordonii, Porphyromonas gingivalis, or Fusobacterium nucleatum and dual-species biofilms of S. gordonii -- F. nucleatum and F. nucleatum -- P. gingivalis were grown on hydroxyapatite discs. Seven species were studied as planktonic cells, including Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Propionibacterium acnes, Actinomyces naeslundii, and the species mentioned above. The viability of planktonic cells and biofilms was analyzed by susceptibility tests and time-kill assays, respectively, against different concentrations of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine. High-performance liquid chromatography was performed to quantify nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine concentrations in the culture media after the assays. Susceptibility tests and viability assays showed that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine cannot reduce or stimulate bacterial growth. High-performance liquid chromatography results showed that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine concentrations were not altered after bacteria exposure. These findings indicate that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine, in the concentrations used, cannot affect significantly the growth of these oral bacterial strains. Moreover, these species do not seem to metabolize these substances.
TI  - Bacterial profiles of root caries in elderly patients.
AB  - Culture-based studies have shown that Streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli are associated with root caries (RC). The purpose of the present study was to assess the bacterial diversity of RC in elderly patients by use of culture-independent molecular techniques and to determine the associations of specific bacterial species or bacterial communities with healthy and carious roots. Plaque was collected from root surfaces of 10 control subjects with no RC and from 11 subjects with RC. The bacterial 16S rRNA genes from extracted DNA were PCR amplified, cloned, and sequenced to determine species identity. From a total of 3,544 clones, 245 predominant species or phylotypes were observed, representing eight bacterial phyla. The majority (54%) of the species detected have not yet been cultivated. Species of Selenomonas and Veillonella were common in all samples. The healthy microbiota included Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, Leptotrichia spp., Selenomonas noxia, Streptococcus cristatus, and Kingella oralis. Lactobacilli were absent, S. mutans was present in one, and Actinomyces spp. were present in 50% of the controls. In contrast, the microbiota of the RC subjects was dominated by Actinomyces spp., lactobacilli, S. mutans, Enterococcus faecalis, Selenomonas sp. clone CS002, Atopobium and Olsenella spp., Prevotella multisaccharivorax, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and Propionibacterium sp. strain FMA5. The bacterial profiles of RC showed considerable subject-to-subject variation, indicating that the microbial communities are more complex than previously presumed. The data suggest that putative etiological agents of RC include not only S. mutans, lactobacilli, and Actinomyces but also species of Atopobium, Olsenella, Pseudoramibacter, Propionibacterium, and Selenomonas.
TI  - Microflora in oral ecosystems in subjects with radiation-induced hyposalivation.
AB  - AIM: To analyse the microbial flora in specific oral sites in 13 dentate subjects, 6-8 months after completed radiation therapy (RT group) and in 13 matched controls. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The microflora on the tongue, buccal mucosa, vestibulum, supragingival plaque and subgingival region was analysed using duplicate sampling and cultivation technique. A clinical examination was also performed. RESULTS: Candida albicans was found in one or more sites in 54% of the RT subjects and in 15% of the controls. In three RT subjects, C. albicans was found at all four sites analysed. An unexpected finding was that enterococci were found in all RT subjects and in high number in 38%. None of the controls harboured enterococci. In supragingival plaque, Lactobacillus spp. were detected in 92% of the RT subjects and the number and proportion of Lactobacillus spp. were extremely high compared with the controls. Mutans streptococci were detected in high numbers in 31% of the RT subjects, while they were not detected in 23%. CONCLUSION: The microbial results explain why some RT subjects have an increased susceptibility to oral diseases and stress that site-specific microbial analysis is an important diagnostic tool when planning oral health preventive care for RT subjects.
TI  - Effect of chlorhexidine/thymol and fluoride varnishes on dental biofilm formation in vitro.
AB  - This study evaluated the effect of chlorhexidine/thymol (CHX/T) and fluoride (F)  varnishes on biofilm formation in vitro. Hydroxyapatite discs coated with varnish were first immersed in saline for 0, 3, 7 or 14 d, then immersed in pasteurized saliva. The discs were incubated for 20 h with a bacterial suspension containing Actinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus oralis, and Veillonella dispar. Uncoated discs were used as controls. Growth of bacteria on the discs was evaluated by culture and by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Bacterial vitality was examined by fluorescence staining. In the CHX/T-treated group, bacterial accumulation was delayed, and the total number of bacteria was significantly lower than in the controls. In the F-treated group, the total number of bacteria did not differ from the control, although the number of S. oralis was lower. Bacterial vitality in the CHX/T and F groups did not differ from that in the controls. The total number of bacteria on the CHX/T-treated discs immersed in saline was significantly higher than that on the non-immersed discs. Biofilm development was inhibited by the CHX/T varnish but not by the F varnish. The effect of the CHX/T varnish decreased following the immersion of discs in saline.
TI  - A novel TEM contrasting technique for extracellular polysaccharides in in vitro biofilms.
AB  - In the past, the visualization of the extracellular matrix of biofilms on an ultrastructural level was hampered by shrinkage artifacts. In addition, the reproducible contrasting of extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) has not satisfactorily been solved. Here we describe a method overcoming these difficulties, which produces artifact-free transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images using multispecies biofilms grown in vitro. Sufficient contrast was achieved by replacing Schiff's reagent with the osmiophilic amino acid methionine. In addition, shrinkage was avoided by replacing the classical dehydration agents with ethylene glycol and 1,2-pentanediol. Applying this method provided images of biofilms with an intact matrix in which differentially contrasted bacteria were embedded. All six members of the biofilm consortium (Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus oralis, Veillonella dispar, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Candida albicans) could be distinguished. Within the matrix, structural differences of EPS, probably due to different proportions of alpha-1,3 and alpha-1,6 linkages, were apparent. Fibrilar polysaccharides were evident around microcolonies of S. sobrinus, and fluffy polysaccharides were detected in the vicinity of S. oralis microcolonies. The ultrastructure of biofilms prepared for TEM using this method allows the imaging of undistorted EPS as well as the differentiated contrasting of the six microbial species of the in vitro biofilm model. This is a major step forward in determining the spatial arrangement of microorganisms in biofilms on an ultrastructural level.
TI  - Odontogenic bacteria in periodontal disease and resistance patterns to common antibiotics used as treatment and prophylaxis in odontology in Spain.
AB  - Resistance in streptococci or Gram-negative bacteria is associated with antibiotic consumption. Scarce information exists on the antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial isolates from patients with periodontitis in countries with high antibiotic consumption, as this is an area in which microbiological testing is not performed in daily practice. The present study was undertaken to explore the susceptibility of bacterial isolates in periodontitis to antibiotics prescribed in odontology in Spain as treatment for local infections or prophylaxis for distant focal infections. Periodontal samples were prospectively collected in 48 patients classified by pocket depth of <4 mm and >or=4 mm. Species were identified by culture, selecting the five most frequent morphotypes per sample, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Susceptibility was determined by E-test. A total of 261 isolates were identified: 72.9% patients had Streptococcus oralis; 70.8% Streptococcus mitis; 60.4% Prevotella buccae; 39.6% Prevotella denticola; 37.5% Fusobacterium nucleatum; 35.4% Prevotella intermedia; 25% Capnocytophaga spp.; 23% Veillonella spp.; 22.9% Prevotella melaninogenica and Streptococcus sanguis; and <20% other species. Streptococcus viridans resistance rates were 0% for amoxicillin, approximately 10% for clindamycin, 9-22% for tetracycline, and for azithromycin ranged from 18.2% for S. sanguis to 47.7% for S. mitis. Prevotella isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, with amoxicillin resistance ranging from 17.1% in P. buccae to 26.3% in P. denticola. Metronidazole resistance was <6% in all Prevotella species, while clindamycin resistance ranged from 0 to 21.1%. beta-Lactamase production was positive in 54.1% Prevotella spp., 38.9% F. nucleatum, 30% Capnocytophaga spp., and 10% Veillonella spp. In this study, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was the most active antibiotic against all species tested, followed by metronidazole in the case of anaerobes.
TI  - Response to alkaline stress by root canal bacteria in biofilms.
AB  - AIM: To determine whether bacteria isolated from infected root canals survive alkaline shifts better in biofilms than in planktonic cultures. METHODOLOGY: Clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus paracasei, Olsenella uli, Streptococcus anginosus, S. gordonii, S. oralis and Fusobacterium nucleatum in biofilm and planktonic cultures were stressed at pH 10.5 for 4 h, and cell viability determined using the fluorescent staining LIVE/DEAD BacLight bacterial viability kit. In addition, proteins released into extracellular culture fluids were identified by Western blotting. RESULTS: Enterococcus faecalis, L. paracasei, O. uli and S. gordonii survived in high numbers in both planktonic cultures and in biofilms after alkaline challenge. S. anginosus, S. oralis and F. nucleatum showed increased viability in biofilms compared with planktonic cultures. Alkaline exposure caused all planktonic cultures to aggregate into clusters and resulted in a greater extrusion of cellular proteins compared with cells in biofilms. Increased levels of DnaK, HPr and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase were observed in culture fluids, especially amongst streptococci. CONCLUSIONS: In general, bacteria isolated from infected roots canals resisted alkaline stress better in biofilms than in planktonic cultures, however, planktonic cells appeared to use aggregation and the extracellular transport of specific proteins as survival mechanisms.
TI  - Efficacy of gasiform ozone and photodynamic therapy on a multispecies oral biofilm in vitro.
AB  - Ozone gas and photodynamic therapy (PDT) have been claimed to be antimicrobially  effective. This study assessed their antimicrobial potential in vitro. Mature six-species oral biofilms were treated as follows (n = 9 per group): (i) a 60-s application of gasiform vacuum-ozone or vacuum alone (on wet or air-dried biofilm samples); (ii) PDT (i.e. methylene blue in combination with or without a diode soft laser, and a soft laser alone); or (iii) antimicrobial solutions: immersion of biofilms for 60 s in 0.2 and 2% chlorhexidine or in 0.5 and 5% hypochlorite solution. Treatment with chlorhexidine or hypochlorite served as a positive control, whereas untreated samples served as negative controls. Colony-forming units on blood agar were counted. Only the 5% hypochlorite solution was able to totally eliminate the microorganisms in the biofilm. The observed reduction of viable counts by vacuum-ozone application and PDT was less than one log(10) step. Under the conditions of the current study, gasiform ozone and PDT had a minimal effect on the viability of microorganisms organized in a cariogenic biofilm.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal species in symptomatic and asymptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  - Phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA was used to examine polymicrobial communities within infected root canals of 20 symptomatic and 14 asymptomatic patients. Nucleotide sequences from approximately 750 clones amplified from each patient group with universal bacterial primers were matched to the Ribosomal Database Project II database. Phylotypes from 37 genera representing Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria were identified. Results were compared to those obtained with species-specific primers designed to detect Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Peptostreptococcus micros, Enterococcus sp., Streptococcus sp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Tannerella forsythensis and Treponema denticola. Since members of the domain Archaea have been implicated in the severity of periodontal disease, and a recent report confirms that archaea are present in endodontic infections, 16S archaeal primers were also used to detect which patients carried these prokaryotes, to determine if their presence correlated with severity of the clinical symptoms. A Methanobrevibacter oralis-like species was detected in one asymptomatic and one symptomatic patient. DNA from root canals of these two patients was further analysed using species-specific primers to determine bacterial cohabitants. Trep. denticola was detected in the asymptomatic but not the symptomatic patient. Conversely, Porph. endodontalis was found in the symptomatic but not the asymptomatic patient. All other species except enterococci were detected with the species-specific primers in both patients. These results confirm the presence of archaea in root canals and provide additional insights into the polymicrobial communities in endodontic infections associated with clinical symptoms.
TI  - Coaggregation interactions between oral and endodontic Enterococcus faecalis and  bacterial species isolated from persistent apical periodontitis.
AB  - Interactions between Enterococcus faecalis and other species found in root canal  infections might be important for the development and persistence of periapical disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the coaggregation interactions between E. faecalis clinical isolates and species previously shown to survive and induce apical periodontitis in monkeys: Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Prevotella oralis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Streptococcus anginosus. Intergeneric coaggregation assays were conducted in duplicate with observations scored immediately at 0 h, 1 h and 24 h after mixing of combinations of strains. All E. faecalis strains (n = 53) coaggregated with F. nucleatum; E. faecalis did not coaggregate with P. anaerobius or S. anginosus. One strain, E. faecalis E1, coaggregated with P. oralis, with aggregates visible at 1 h. Coaggregation interactions between E. faecalis and F. nucleatum observed in this study suggest a potential role for this combination in endodontic infections.
TI  - Association of Eubacterium nodatum and Treponema denticola with human periodontitis lesions.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present investigation was to compare the levels, proportions and percentage of sites colonized by 40 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples from periodontally healthy subjects and patients with chronic periodontitis to seek possible pathogens other than the consensus pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia. METHOD: Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 635 subjects with chronic periodontitis and 189 periodontally healthy subjects. The samples were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (total samples = 21,832). Mean counts, % DNA probe counts and percentage of sites colonized at >10(5) were determined for each species in each subject and then averaged in each clinical group. Significance of difference between groups was determined using the Mann-Whitney test. Association between combinations of species and periodontal status was examined by stepwise logistic regression analysis. Analyses were repeated using a subset of subjects from both clinical groups who had proportions of P. gingivalis plus T. forsythia less than the median (4.42%) found in periodontally healthy subjects. All analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: For the 824 subjects the consensus pathogens P. gingivalis and T. forsythia as well as Eubacterium nodatum and Treponema denticola had significantly higher mean counts, proportions and percentage of sites colonized in samples from subjects with periodontitis than from periodontally healthy subjects. There were significantly more Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Streptococcus gordonii and Veillonella parvula in periodontally healthy subjects. E. nodatum, T. denticola, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus intermedius, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii all had higher counts and proportions in diseased than healthy subjects who had low proportions of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia. Logistic regression analysis indicated that the same species groups were associated with disease status after adjusting for the proportions of the other species. CONCLUSIONS: This investigation confirmed the strong association of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia with chronic periodontitis and emphasized a strong association of E. nodatum and T. denticola with periodontitis whether in the presence or absence of high levels of the consensus pathogens. Other species, including S. oralis, Eikenella corrodens, S. intermedius and F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, were associated with disease when P. gingivalis and T. forsythia were present in low proportions.
TI  - Effects of Streptococcus mutans gtfC deficiency on mixed oral biofilms in vitro.
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the influence of glucosyltransferase-gene-negative (gtf-) Streptococcus mutans strains unable to synthesize water-insoluble or soluble glucan on the structure and macromolecular diffusion properties of in vitro grown mixed oral biofilms. Biofilms modeling supragingival plaque consisted of Actinomyces naeslundii OMZ 745, Candida albicans OMZ 110, Fusobacterium nucleatum KP-F2, Streptococcus oralis SK 248, Veillonella dispar ATCC 17748T and one of the S. mutans strains UA159, OMZ 966, OMZ 937 or OMZ 977. Biofilms were grown anaerobically on sintered hydroxyapatite disks for 64.5 h at 37 degrees C. To perform confocal laser scanning microscopy analyses, microorganisms were stained with Syto 13 and extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) with Calcofluor. Macromolecular diffusion properties were measured following timed biofilm exposure to Texas-Red-labeled 70-kDa dextran. Results showed that replacing wild-type S. mutans by a gtfC- mutant led to an increase in the volume fraction occupied by cells from 29 to 48% and a decrease of the EPS volume fraction from 51 to 33%. No such changes were observed when the S. mutans wild-type strain was replaced by a gtfB- or gtfD- mutant. The diffusion coefficient of 70-kDa dextran in biofilms containing the gtfC- S. mutans was 16-fold higher than in biofilms with the wild-type strain indicating a strong macromolecular sieving effect of GTF C-generated glucans. Our data demonstrate the influence of EPS on the structure and macromolecular diffusion properties of an oral biofilm model and uncover our still limited knowledge of the function of EPS in biofilms and plaque.
TI  - The ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence.
AB  - Some novel caries detection and excavation devices rely on the ability of bacteria to produce red fluorescing compounds. The aim of this study was to examine the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence. Streptococcus mutans, S. oralis, S. salivarius, S. sobrinus, Lactobacillus fermentans, L. casei, L. rhamnosus, Actinomyces naeslundi, A. israelii, Prevotella intermedia, and Fusobacterium nucleatum were inoculated onto Columbia agar with haemin and vitamin K and incubated anaerobically for up to 7 days in the dark. The resulting bacterial colonies were excited using filtered xenon light (405 +/- 20 nm) and digitally photographed through a 530-nm high-pass filter. The red and green portions of the colony fluorescence were analyzed using a computer program and the red/green ratio was calculated. All colonies emitted both red and green fluorescence. The green outweighed the red portion for the following species (in descending order) S. oralis, S. salivarius, S. mutans, F. nucleatum and S. sobrinus. The red portion was higher for the following species (in descending order) P. intermedia, A. naeslundi, A. israelii, L. fermentans, L. rhamnosus and L. casei. With all the bacteria examined, one color portion generally outweighed the other, giving the visual impression of either red or green fluorescence. We conclude that red fluorescence is well suited to detection of the bacteria which cause dentin caries but it is not suitable as an indicator of the presence and activity of the streptococci involved in initial caries.
TI  - Fiber optic fluorescence microprobe for endodontic diagnosis.
AB  - Successful endodontic therapy requires total debridement as well as complete obturation of the root canal to the cemento-dentinal junction. The goal of this study was to investigate the feasibility of using quantitative fluorescence spectroscopy for the detection and localization of pathological dentin, pulpal remnants, and microorganisms within the root canal. Specific aims were to identify: 1) characteristic excitation/emission spectra for healthy dentin, decayed dentin, enamel, and pulp; 2) the potential of specific spectral data for differentiating between these tissues; and 3) the potential of spectral data for detecting the presence and identifying four common endodontic pathogens. Fluorescence spectra were determined in the tissues of permanent human teeth, extirpated healthy and necrotic pulps, and four endodontic pathogens. Excitation/emission spectra were collected at 366 nm, 405 nm, and 440 nm excitation. Marked differences in spectral signatures between the different tissues under investigation were observed. We postulate that the differences in fluorescence spectra of decayed vs. healthy dentin are due to the loss of mineralized tissue components and increased organic presence and water in these tissues. Pulpal tissue showed distinctly different fluorescence spectra from healthy and decayed dentin, providing a basis for differentiating between tissue categories. Each bacterial species demonstrated distinct spectral emission patterns.
TI  - Apical periodontitis development and bacterial response to endodontic treatment.  Experimental root canal infections in monkeys with selected bacterial strains.
AB  - In six monkeys, 160 root canals were inoculated with a combination of four bacterial strains belonging to species Streptococcus milleri, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Prevotella oralis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. In two other monkeys, 24 root canals were inoculated with a five-strain combination consisting of these strains and a strain of Enterococcus faecalis. All strains were previously isolated from an infected monkey root canal. After 8-12 months, survival of the strains was recorded bacteriologically, and the reaction in the periapical region was radiographed. From 180 of 184 root canals, one or more of the bacterial strains were reisolated. The two facultative strains were more frequently reisolated than the anaerobic strains. Apical periodontitis was registered in the periapical region of more than 96% of root canals with reisolated bacteria but in none of those without reisolated bacteria. Endodontic treatment was carried out in two sessions with an interval of 14 d without interappointment dressings, and the effect was evaluated bacteriologically before and after each treatment. The chemo-mechanical treatment reduced significantly the number of strains and bacterial cells. The facultative bacteria were more resistant to the treatment than the anaerobic bacteria. The five-strain combination had a higher survival rate than the four-strain combination.
TI  - Selection for high-level resistance by chronic triclosan exposure is not universal.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of triclosan exposure on the antimicrobial  susceptibilities of numerically important dental bacteria. METHODS: A gradient plate technique was used to expose Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Neisseria subflava, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Prevotella nigrescens, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans and Veillonella dispar repeatedly to escalating, sublethal concentrations of triclosan. Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 was included as an organism showing the triclosan resistance development trait. MIC values towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were determined before and after biocide exposure. RESULTS: N. subflava, Pr. nigrescens Po. gingivalis and E. coli were highly susceptible to triclosan (MIC range 0.1-3.9 mg/L), whereas the lactobacillus and S. mutans were less susceptible (MIC range 15.6-20.8 mg/L). Triclosan exposure resulted in a highly significant ( approximately 400-fold) reduction in triclosan susceptibility (P < 0.01) for the positive control E. coli, although its MICs towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were not significantly altered. Minor ( approximately two-fold) decreases in triclosan susceptibility (MIC) occurred for Pr. nigrescens and in S. sanguis and S. oralis (MBC). Mean changes in susceptibilities (MIC and MBC) of the oral species to chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline did not exceed two-fold, although chlorhexidine MBCs for S. sanguis were markedly, but transiently, increased. CONCLUSIONS: These data fail to demonstrate biologically significant drug resistance in triclosan-exposed bacteria and suggest that markedly decreased triclosan susceptibility, although confirmed for E. coli, is not a universal phenomenon. Other bacteria possibly possess more susceptible targets than FabI that are highly conserved, which may govern triclosan activity.
TI  - Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase of Streptococcus oralis functions as a coadhesin for Porphyromonas gingivalis major fimbriae.
AB  - Cohesive interactions between Porphyromonas gingivalis and plaque-forming bacteria, such as Streptococcus oralis, are considered to play an important role in the colonization of P. gingivalis in periodontal sites. Although P. gingivalis fimbriae have been reported to mediate coaggregation with S. oralis, the S. oralis molecule involved has not been identified. We identified the coadhesin of S. oralis ATCC 9811 and purified it by affinity column chromatography. We found that the molecular mass of the purified protein was approximately 40 kDa. Dot blot and Western blot assays showed binding of the 40-kDa protein to P. gingivalis fimbriae. Further, turbidimetric assays showed that the coadhesin inhibited coaggregation between P. gingivalis and S. oralis in a dose-dependent manner. Analyses of the amino-terminal sequences of the protein and its lysyl endopeptidase-cleaved fragments revealed that the coadhesin was identical to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Next, we cloned the gene that encodes S. oralis GAPDH and found that the sequence had a high degree of homology with the sequences of GAPDHs of various bacteria, including Streptococcus gordonii and Fusobacterium nucleatum. To confirm the contribution of S. oralis GAPDH to the interaction with P. gingivalis, a recombinant GAPDH protein was generated in Escherichia coli; this protein bound to P. gingivalis fimbriae and had an inhibitory effect on coaggregation. These results suggest that S. oralis GAPDH functions as a coadhesin for P. gingivalis fimbriae. In addition, considering the high degree of homology of the GAPDHs of various bacteria, those of other plaque-forming bacteria also may contribute to the colonization of P. gingivalis.
TI  - Multiplex FISH analysis of a six-species bacterial biofilm.
AB  - Established procedures use different and seemingly incompatible experimental protocols for fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The aim of this study was to develop a procedure, based on FISH and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), for the analysis of the spatial organization of in vitro biofilms containing both Gram-negative and Gram-positive oral bacteria. Biofilms composed of the six oral species Actinomyces naeslundii, Candida albicans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sobrinus, and Veillonella dispar were grown anaerobically for 64.5 h at 37 degrees C on hydroxyapatite disks preconditioned with saliva. Conditions for the simultaneous in situ hybridization of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria were sought by systematic variation of fixation and exposure to lysozyme. After fixation and permeabilization biofilms were labeled by FISH with 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes ANA103 (for the detection of A. naeslundii), EUK116 (C. albicans), FUS664 (F. nucleatum), MIT447 and MIT588 (S. oralis), SOB174 (S. sobrinus), and VEI217 (V. dispar). Probes were used as 6-FAM, Cy3 or Cy5 conjugates, resulting in green, orange-red or deep-red fluorescence of target cells, respectively. Thus, with two independent triple-hybridizations with three probes carrying different fluorescence-tags, all six species could be visualized. Results show that the simultaneous investigation by FISH of complex biofilms composed of multiple bacterial species with differential Gram-staining properties is possible. In combination with the optical sectioning properties of CLSM the technique holds great promise for the analysis of spatial alterations in biofilm composition in response to environmental challenges.
TI  - Distribution of selected bacterial species on intraoral surfaces.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: To examine the proportions of 40 bacterial species in samples from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces and saliva in systemically healthy adult subjects and to compare these microbiotas with those of supra- and subgingival plaque. METHODS: Microbial samples were taken from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces of 225 systemically healthy subjects using a "buccal brush". Saliva was taken by expectoration. Forty-four of these subjects provided additional supra- and subgingival plaque samples. Samples were individually evaluated for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The percentage of total DNA probe count was determined for each species, at each sample location and averaged across subjects. The significance of differences among the proportions of the 40 test species at different sample locations was sought in the 225 and 44 subjects separately using the Quade test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. Cluster analysis was performed using the proportions of the 40 species at the different sample locations using the minimum similarity coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. The proportions of each species were averaged across subjects in the resulting cluster groups and the significance of differences was tested using the t-test and ANOVA. RESULTS: Microbial profiles differed markedly among sample locations in the 225 subjects, with 34 of 40 species differing significantly. Proportions of Veillonella parvula and Prevotella melaninogenica were higher in saliva and on the lateral and dorsal surfaces of the tongue, while Streptococcus mitis and S. oralis were in significantly lower proportions in saliva and on the tongue dorsum. Cluster analysis resulted in the formation of 2 clusters with >85% similarity. Cluster 1 comprised saliva, lateral and dorsal tongue surfaces, while Cluster 2 comprised the remaining soft tissue locations. V. parvula, P. melaninogenica, Eikenella corrodens, Neisseria mucosa, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Fusobacterium periodonticum, F. nucleatum ss vincentii and Porphyromonas gingivalis were in significantly higher proportions in Cluster 1 and S. mitis, S. oralis and S. noxia were significantly higher in Cluster 2. These findings were confirmed using data from the 44 subjects providing plaque samples. The microbial profiles of supra- and subgingival plaque differed from the other sample locations, particularly in the increased proportions of the Actinomyces species. Species of different genera exhibited different proportions on the various intraoral surfaces, but even within the genus Streptococcus, there were differences in colonization patterns. S. oralis, S. mitis and S. constellatus colonized the soft tissues and saliva in higher proportions than the samples from the teeth, while the other 4 streptococcal species examined colonized the dental surfaces in proportions comparable to the soft tissue locations and saliva. CONCLUSIONS: Proportions of bacterial species differed markedly on different intraoral surfaces. The microbiota of saliva was most similar to that of the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the tongue. The microbiotas of the soft tissues resembled each other more than the microbiotas that colonized the teeth both above and below the gingival margin.
TI  - Subgingival microbiota levels and their associations with periodontal status at the sampled sites in an adult Sudanese population using miswak or toothbrush regularly.
AB  - Little information is available on the effect of miswak use on gingival microbiota. We assessed levels of 28 oral bacteria in subgingival plaque of adult Sudanese miswak (n = 38) and toothbrush users (n = 36) age range 20-53 years (mean 34.6 years) to study associations between these bacteria, oral hygiene method, and periodontal status at the sampled sites. A pooled subgingival plaque sample from 6 probing sites of 1 selected tooth in each jaw was obtained from each subject. Whole genomic DNA probes and the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization were used in assessing 74 pooled samples. Using 10(5) bacterial cells threshold, between 2.6% and 47.4% of miswak users and between 2.8% and 36.1% of toothbrush users harbored the investigated species. The percentages of subjects with the investigated species at 10(6) bacterial cells varied between 2.6% and 39.5% in miswak and between 2.8% and 36.1% in toothbrush users. Miswak users harbored significantly higher Streptococcus intermedius, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Veillonella parvula, Actinomyces israelii, and Capnocytophaga gingivalis, and significantly lower Selenomonas sputigena, Streptococcus salivarius, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Streptococcus oralis than did toothbrush users. Probing pocket depth > or = 6 mm showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and V. parvula than those 4-5 mm. Our results indicate that the type of oral hygiene had a significant effect on levels of 11 out of 28 bacterial species, and that the type of effect was also dependent on type of bacteria and probing pocket depth.
TI  - Mass transport of macromolecules within an in vitro model of supragingival plaque.
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the diffusion of macromolecules through an in vitro biofilm model of supragingival plaque. Polyspecies biofilms containing Actinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sobrinus, Veillonella dispar, and Candida albicans were formed on sintered hydroxyapatite disks and then incubated at room temperature for defined periods with fluorescent markers with molecular weights ranging from 3,000 to 900,000. Subsequent examination by confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that the mean square penetration depths for all tested macromolecules except immunoglobulin M increased linearly with time, diffusion coefficients being linearly proportional to the cube roots of the molecular weights of the probes (range, 10,000 to 240,000). Compared to diffusion in bulk water, diffusion in the biofilms was markedly slower. The rate of diffusion for each probe appeared to be constant and not a function of biofilm depth. Analysis of diffusion phenomena through the biofilms suggested tortuosity as the most probable explanation for retarded diffusion. Selective binding of probes to receptors present in the biofilms could not explain the observed extent of retardation of diffusion. These results are relevant to oral health, as selective attenuated diffusion of fermentable carbohydrates and acids produced within dental plaque is thought to be essential for the development of carious lesions.
TI  - Salivary microbiota levels in relation to periodontal status, experience of caries and miswak use in Sudanese adults.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult Sudanese subjects. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. The periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. Whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method using whole genomic DNA probes. RESULTS: A high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or = 105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. Between 12% and 16% of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, C. rectus and E. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum, respectively. There were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. Presence of > or = 105 L. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). There were significantly higher levels of A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. melaninogenica, C. rectus, P. micros, V. parvula, S. mutans, S. anginosus, A. israelii, C. sputigena, and C. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, S. sputigena, E. corrodens, L. acidophilus, S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. oralis, and S. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. CONCLUSIONS: : The findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. This is the first report that the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.
TI  - Effects of glucose and fluoride on competition and metabolism within in vitro dental bacterial communities and biofilms.
AB  - Antimicrobial effects of fluoride in vivo remain contentious. Previous studies suggested that 1 mM NaF reduced acid production from glucose, and prevented the enrichment of bacteria associated with caries in a chemostat model. The present study examines the effects of a lower fluoride concentration (0.53 mM, 10 ppm NaF) in both biofilm and planktonic microbial communities. Nine oral species were grown at pH 7.0 and pulsed on 10 successive days with glucose; bacterial metabolism was allowed to reduce the pH for 6 h before being returned to neutrality, either in the presence or absence of NaF. In addition, 10-day-old mixed culture biofilms were overlaid with glucose, with or without NaF, and the pH change followed by microelectrode. After 10 days, chemostat pH dropped to ca. pH 4.5 following glucose pulses, and the community was dominated by Streptococcus mutans (rising from 4 to 23% of total CFU) and Veillonella dispar (16 to 73%). In comparison, after 10 days pulsing with glucose + fluoride, the final pH was significantly higher (ca. pH 4.9) (paired t test, p < 0.0001). The culture was predominated by V. dispar (70%) and Actinomyces naeslundii (13%), whereas S. mutans proportions were significantly lower (t test, p = 0.04), remaining <3% of the total flora, compared to the culture without fluoride. Biofilm pH fell to only pH 5.55 1 h after glucose/fluoride overlay, compared to 4.55 with glucose alone (paired t test, p < 0.000001). Analysis of the data suggests that fluoride exerts dual antimicrobial modes of action. Fluoride prevents enrichment of S. mutans by inhibiting critical metabolic processes (direct effect) and, in an inter-related way, by reducing environmental acidification (indirect effect) in biofilms.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological studies of periodontal disease in Sjogren syndrome patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the periodontal status of patients with Sjogren's Syndrome (SS), a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized by xerophthalmia and xerostomia. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the periodontal status of SS patients, in terms of clinical and microbiological parameters, differs from systemically healthy age- and gender-matched controls. METHODS: 8 primary SS and 10 secondary SS patients were examined in comparison with 11 control subjects. All patients were diagnosed by the European Community Criteria. Control subjects were systemically healthy and not undergoing periodontal treatment. The comparison of clinical status was made in terms of mean periodontal parameters (plaque index, gingival index, gingival recession, probing pocket depth, probing attachment level and bleeding on probing) as well as the frequency distribution of probing pocket depth and probing attachment level measurements. Microbiological assays of the subgingival dental plaque samples were carried out by both a chairside enzyme test (Periocheck) for the detection of peptidase activity (PA) and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for 9 selected periodontal micro-organisms (Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Treponema denticola, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Eikenella corrodens, Campylobacter rectus, Bacteroides forsythus, Streptococcus oralis). RESULTS: The occurrence, severity and extent of periodontal lesions were not significantly different between the 3 patient groups for all periodontal parameters examined. No significant differences in the sub-gingival plaque samples from control, primary or secondary SS patients for the PA test, frequency or type of periodontal micro-organisms observed. CONCLUSION: No significant differences could be detected in either clinical or microbiological parameters of primary or secondary SS patients compared with that of control subjects. The results of the present study thus support the notion that the periodontal status of patients with SS do not differ from systemically healthy age- and gender-matched controls.
TI  - [Clinical and bacteriological features of six cases with intracranial abscess in  childhood].
AB  - From October 1988 to March 2001, 5 patients with 6 episodes of intracranial abscesses were admitted to Chiba-Children's Hospital. Average age when they were admitted was 10 years and 1 month. Initial clinical symptoms were fever in 5 cases, and headache in 1 case. It took 21 days from the appearance of the initial symptoms to diagnose the intracranial abscess. Four out of 5 patients had underlying diseases that were prone to cause intracranial abscess. Two patients of these were cyanotic congenital heart diseases (tetralogy of Fallot and asplenic heart), and the other 2 were sinusitis. Computed tomography revealed that brain abscess was found in 5 cases, and subdural empyema in 1 case. There were 3 single and multiple abscesses each. The most common lesion was the temporal lobe. Eight bacterial strains were isolated from 5 cases. Five were streptococci (3 were Streptococcus milleri group, other 2 were Streptococcus oralis and microaerophilic Streptococcus) and 3 were anaerobes (Prevotella loescheii, Prevotella bivia and Fusobacterium nucleatum). Antimicrobial therapy was started with panipenem-betamiprone in 3 cases, imipenem-cilastatin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin in the other cases resre ctinely. Duration of therapy ranged from 28 to 67 days (45 days, average). In 5 cases, drainage with craniotomy was performed in addition to antimicrobial therapy. One case was treated medically alone, but this was the only case with recurrence after 1 year 2 months. There were no serious complications such as intraventricular rupture of abscess. All patients had good outcomes, but mild neurological sequela was found in 1 case.
TI  - Efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes (II). Effect on microbiological parameters.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: The purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (Crest Complete) or power (Braun 3D Plaque Remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. METHODS: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. At baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. After random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. Clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. Significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the Quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: Mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. Streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while Streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. Mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. Major reductions occurred in both groups for A. naeslundii, A. israelii/gerencseriae, Peptostreptococcus micros, Veillonella parvula, Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, S. mitis/oralis/sanguis and S. constellatus/intermedius. All taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. The reductions in prevalence were greater for A. naeslundii, S. constellatus/intermedius, V. parvula, A. israelii/gerencseriae, S. mitis/oralis/sanguis, P. micros, Streptococcus mutans and P. intermedia/nigrescens. Mean prevalence was decreased more for Porphyromonas gingivalis, Campylobacter rectus/showae, Treponema denticola and Bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. CONCLUSIONS: The major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the subgingival microbiota. Counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. This reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. Further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.
TI  - Phosphorylcholine-dependent cross-reactivity between dental plaque bacteria and oxidized low-density lipoproteins.
AB  - Antibodies reactive with phosphorylcholine (PC) are ubiquitous in human sera, but the antigens stimulating their production and their function are not clear. Previous studies have shown that a significant proportion of dental plaque bacteria contain PC as determined by reactivity with PC-specific mouse myeloma proteins and monoclonal antibodies. Additionally, serum antibody concentrations of immunoglobulin (IgG) G anti-PC are higher in sera of individuals who have experienced periodontal attachment loss than those who are periodontally healthy. These data implicate the oral microflora as a source of antigen-stimulating anti-PC responses. Recent data also indicate that antibodies with specificity for PC are elevated in ApoE-deficient mice, a model for studies of athersclerosis, and that such antibodies bound oxidized low-density lipoproteins (LDL) (oxLDL) in atherosclerotic plaques. These data prompted the hypothesis that human anti-PC could bind to both oral bacteria and human oxLDL, and that these antigens are cross-reactive. We therefore examined the ability of human anti-PC to bind to PC-bearing strains of oral bacteria using enzyme-linked immunosorbent inhibition assays and by assessment of direct binding of affinity-purified human anti-PC to PC-bearing Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Our results indicated that PC-bearing strains of Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and A. actinomycetemcomitans, as well as a strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae, absorbed up to 80% of anti-PC IgG antibody from human sera. Furthermore, purified anti-PC bound to a PC-bearing strain of A. actinomycetemcomitans but only poorly to a PC-negative strain. OxLDL also absorbed anti-PC from human sera, and oxLDL but not LDL reacted with up to 80% of the anti-PC in human sera. Furthermore, purified anti-PC bound directly to oxLDL but not to LDL. The data indicate that PC-containing antigens on a variety of common oral bacteria are cross-reactive with neoantigens expressed in oxLDL. We propose that PC-bearing dental plaque microorganisms may induce an antibody response to PC that could influence the inflammatory response associated with atherosclerosis.
TI  - Validation of an in vitro biofilm model of supragingival plaque.
AB  - The study of biofilm structure and function mandates the use of model systems for which a host of environmental variables can be rigorously controlled. We describe a model of supragingival plaque containing Actinomyces naeslundii, Veillonella dispar, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus sobrinus, and Streptococcus oralis wherein cells are cultivated anaerobically in a saliva-based medium on hydroxyapatite discs coated with a salivary pellicle, with material and pieces of apparatus common to all microbiology laboratories. After 0.5 hr, 16.5 hrs, 40.5 hrs, and 64.5 hrs, the composition of adherent biofilms was analyzed by culture techniques, live/dead fluorescence staining, and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Repeated independent trials demonstrated the repeatability of biofilm formation after 40.5 hrs and 64.5 hrs. Brief exposures of biofilms to chlorhexidine or Triclosan produced losses in viability similar to those observed in vivo. This biofilm model should prove very useful for pre-clinical testing of prospective anti-plaque agents at clinically relevant concentrations.
TI  - Spatial arrangements and associative behavior of species in an in vitro oral biofilm model.
AB  - The spatial arrangements and associative behavior of Actinomyces naeslundii, Veillonella dispar, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus sobrinus, and Streptococcus oralis strains in an in vitro model of supragingival plaque were determined. Using species-specific fluorescence-labeled antibodies in conjunction with confocal laser scanning microscopy, the volumes and distribution of the five strains were assessed during biofilm formation. The volume-derived cell numbers of each strain correlated well with respective culture data. Between 15 min and 64 h, populations of each strain increased in a manner reminiscent of batch growth. The microcolony morphologies of all members of the consortium and their distributions within the biofilm were characterized, as were interspecies associations. Biofilms formed 15 min after inoculation consisted principally of single nonaggregated cells. All five strains adhered strongly to the saliva-conditioned substratum, and therefore, coadhesion played no role during the initial phase of biofilm formation. This observation does not reflect the results of in vitro coaggregation of the five strains, which depended upon the nature of the suspension medium. While the possibility cannot be excluded that some interspecies associations observed at later stages of biofilm formation were initiated by coadhesion, increase in bacterial numbers appeared to be largely a growth phenomenon regulated by the prevailing cultivation conditions.
TI  - The formation of mixed culture biofilms of oral species along a gradient of shear stress.
AB  - A chemostat mixed culture system was used to produce two distinct ecological states, state-1 (caries-like microcosm) and state-2 (periodontal-like microcosm). Eleven bacterial species (Streptococcus gordonii, Strep. mitis I, Strep. mutans, Strep. oralis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Lactobacillus casei, Neisseria subflava, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella nigrescens, Veillonella dispar) were used to inoculate the planktonic system. A flow cell, designed to produce convergent flow with increasing shear stress, was attached to the chemostat system, and the resultant biofilms developed from the state-1 and state-2 microcosms along the shear stress gradient were examined and compared using image analysis and viable counts. The biofilm produced from state-1 showed a lower shear stress tolerance (0.146 Pa) than the state-2 biofilm (0.236 Pa). The biofilm compositions did not vary along the gradient of shear stress and were dependent on the initial inoculum conditions. Gram-positive species were predominant in the state-1 biofilm, while Gram-negative species were predominant in state-2.
TI  - Automated immunofluorescence for enumeration of selected taxa in supragingival dental plaque.
AB  - The present study investigated a recently developed automated image analysis technique for its applicability to the enumeration of selected bacteria in supragingival dental plaque. Following initial calibration, the system is capable to count fluorescence-labeled target cells in up to 48 samples without user interference. Test samples contained a characteristic mixture of planktonic bacteria, small almost planar bacterial aggregates, and large, virtually indisruptable clumps with cells from multiple species. Due to their complex composition, these samples provided a challenging validation step for the image analysis system. Automated enumeration of target bacteria was compared with visual counting of the fluorescence-labeled bacteria. Results are shown for six taxa (Actinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia/Prev. nigrescens, Streptococcus gordonii/Strep. oralis/Strep. sanguis, Strep. sobrinus, and Veillonella dispar/ V. parvula) with characteristic differences in abundance, cell morphology and aggregation behavior. Results revealed good correspondence between the two enumeration techniques (correlation coefficients ranging from 0.77 to 0.92) provided that the portion of target bacteria exceeded 0.05% of the total bacterial cell number. This work demonstrates the applicability and usefulness of fully automated immunofluorescence to analyze such complex ecosystems as supragingival dental plaque.
TI  - Characterization of bacterial orofacial infections using a new murine model.
AB  - We devised a new murine orofacial infection model using bacteria from odontogenic infection origins and characterized the experimental infections. In this model, bacteria were injected into the submandible of mice. Streptococcus constellatus and Peptostreptococcus micros produced a single abscess at the injection site and their abscess-forming and lethal abilities were low: the median abscess-forming dose (AF(50)) of S. constellatus and P. micros were 10(8.5-10.7)and 10(10.2-10.6)cfu/mouse, and their median lethal dose (LD(50)) were >11 and 10(10.6-11)cfu/mouse, respectively. Prevotella oralis and Fusobacterium nucleatum produced multiple abscesses and their abscess-forming and lethal abilities were strong: AF(50)of P. oralis and F. nucleatum were 10(6.0-6.4)and 10(7. 0-8.7)cfu/mouse, and their LD(50)were 10(7.0-7.7)and 10(8.3-9. 9)cfu/mouse, respectively. LD(50)of P. intermedia and P. gingivalis were 10(9.4->11)and 10(8.9-9.1)cfu/mouse, respectively. Prevotella intermedia and Porphyromonas gingivalis generated a necrotizing lesion, which progressed rapidly. We conclude that this murine model could reflect human orofacial odontogenic infections and is useful to investigate the pathogenicity of causative bacteria of such infections.
TI  - Profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  - Eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. The aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). The samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. Forty-one different microbial species were isolated. Gemella morbillorum and Peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while P. micros, Streptococcus intermedius, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella loeschei, P. melaninogenica and Selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. The bacterial species S. constellatus, G. morbillorum and P. magnus were isolated in greater numbers in incisors and P. micros, S. intermedius, Campylobacter concisus, Bacteroides egertheii, B. forsythus, P. oralis and S. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. Cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. Cluster I was predominated by S. constellatus, S. mitis, S. sanguis, G. morbillorum, P. melaninogenica and P. oralis; cluster II was predominated by S. sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, C. ochracea and P. intermedia; cluster III was predominated by S. mitis, C. ochracea, F. nucleatum, P. loeschei, P. melaninogenica and P. oralis; and finally cluster IV was predominated by S. sanguis, C. gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Campylobacter gracilis, F. nucleatum and P. intermedia. The bacterial species S. constellatus, P. micros, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Eikenella corrodens and F. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while S. intermedius, C. concisus, P. intermedia and P. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.
TI  - Microbiota of successful osseointegrated dental implants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The long-term survival of dental implants depends, in part, on control of bacterial infection in the peri-implant region. Periodontal pathogens colonized implants symptomatic through infection, whereas the microbiota of successful implants was similar to that of periodontal health. This study examined the impact on the peri-implant microbiota of crown restorations; implant type; length of time of loading; history of implant or periodontal infections; and whether implants replaced single or multiple teeth. It was of particular interest to evaluate implant colonization by species in a newly described red complex of periodontal pathogens, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Bacteroides forsythus. METHODS: This study sampled 43 partially edentulous subjects with successfully osseointegrated titanium root-form dental implants. Eighty-one (81) non-submerged and 20 submerged asymptomatic implants, 83 crowned, and 36 uncrowned teeth were sampled from peri-implant or subgingival sites. The microbiota of samples was evaluated using whole genomic DNA probes in a checkerboard assay to 23 subgingival species. RESULTS: Implants were colonized principally by oral streptococci, capnocytophagae, Veillonella parvula, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The periodontal species, P. gingivalis, B. forsythus, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, and Campylobacter rectus were detected in a few subjects. The microbiota around crowned implants and crowned teeth was similar. Streptococcus oralis, P. intermedia, and Selenomonas noxia were elevated in samples from uncrowned teeth compared to crowned teeth and implants. Microbial complexity increased as loading time increased, but colonization by periodontal pathogens, including red complex species, was higher in subjects with previous periodontal disease. No differences were observed in the microbiota of 1- and 2-stage implants, or between implants supporting single or multiple restorations. CONCLUSIONS: While presence of crowns had only a minor impact on the peri-implant microbiota, microbial changes were observed the longer the implants had been in function and in those patients with a history of periodontal or peri-implant infections. A history of periodontitis had a greater impact on the peri-implant microbiota than implant loading time. The major influence on the peri-implant microbiota was, however, the microbiota on remaining teeth. P. gingivalis and B. forsythus, red complex periodontal pathogens, colonized several implants, although all implants were successfully osseointegrated.
TI  - Dominant cross-reactive antibodies generated during the response to a variety of  oral bacterial species detect phosphorylcholine.
AB  - The intraperitoneal immunization of Balb/c mice with subgingival plaque from advanced periodontal pockets or with certain strains of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces israelii, Streptococcus mitis, or Streptococcus oralis yielded frequently indistinguishable IgM monoclonal antibodies which were reactive with antigens from a variety of oral bacteria. This study aimed to characterize the specificity of such monoclonal antibodies and the diversity of oral bacteria expressing this target antigen or epitope. Using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to study a variety of competitor substances for their capacity to bind to the monoclonal antibodies, we identified phosphorylcholine as the recognized epitope. The concentration of positive bacteria with extraordinarily bright cell wall fluorescence in indirect immunofluorescence assays varied between 0.1% and 15% in subgingival and from 10 to 40% in supragingival plaque samples. Labeled bacteria belonged to different morphotypes, including cocci, rods, and filaments. Of 75 species tested in vitro, 14 gram-positive and four gram-negative species were found to harbor positive strains. Haemophilus aphrophilus, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces georgiae, Actinomyces gerencseriae, Actinomyces israelii, and Actinomyces odontolyticus were human oral species of which all tested strains were capable of binding the cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies. In contrast, Actinomyces naeslundii was consistently negative. These data provide evidence for a much more common expression of phosphorylcholine by oral bacteria than hitherto believed but do not indicate an obvious association of phosphorylcholine expression with oral health or inflammatory periodontal diseases.
TI  - Analysis of pH-driven disruption of oral microbial communities in vitro.
AB  - Previously, a mixed culture chemostat system was used to demonstrate that the pH  generated from carbohydrate metabolism, rather than carbohydrate availability per se, was responsible for the shifts observed in the oral microflora which are associated with high carbohydrate diets and the development of dental caries. The aim of this study was to determine more accurately the microbially generated pH at which such shifts occurred. Nine oral bacteria were grown in three independent chemostats, and pulsed with glucose on 10 consecutive days. In one chemostat, pH control was discontinued for 6 h, and the pH fall was restricted to a minimum value of pH 5.5; the pH fall was arrested in the other two chemostats at either pH 5. 0, or at pH 4.5. When the pH was allowed to fall, the numbers and proportions of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus rhamnosus increased; this increase was directly related to the magnitude of the pH fall. Veillonella dispar was the most numerous organism following all glucose pulsing regimes, especially at low pH. The increase in proportions of acidogenic bacteria was accompanied by a fall in the proportions of acid-sensitive species (Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella nigrescens, Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus oralis). The counts of these species were relatively stable between pH 5.5 and 4.5, but were markedly reduced when the pH fell below pH 4.5; Neisseria subflava could not persist in the culture at pH 4.5 or below. The data suggest that the disruption of communities associated with glucose metabolism and low pH can be explained in terms of a two-stage process. A fall in pH to a value between pH 5.5 and 4.5 may allow the enrichment of potentially cariogenic species, whilst permitting species associated with health to remain relatively unaffected. A further reduction in pH (<pH 4.5) may not only enhance the competitiveness of odontopathogens, but inhibit the growth and metabolism of non-caries-associated species. The results also indicate that species other that mutans streptococci or lactobacilli are competitive at pH values low enough to demineralise enamel, and thus suggest that a broader range of micro-organisms may be associated with caries initiation.
TI  - Characterization of a novel N-acetylneuraminic acid-specific Fusobacterium nucleatum PK1594 adhesin.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum has been identified as significantly associated with sites with active periodontal disease and, as a group, the oral fusobacteria coaggregate with members of all oral bacteria genera tested. Monoclonal antibodies were prepared and used in conjunction with other potential inhibitors, such as simple sugars and amino acids, to characterize coaggregation interactions, of F. nucleatum PK1594. Four unique monoclonal antibodies, 5H11, 14C7, 19F2 and 29C12, were obtained by their ability to inhibit coaggregation of F. nucleatum PK1594 with Actinomyces israelii PK16. They were also capable of inhibiting other coaggregations including Streptococcus oralis H1, S. oralis J22, Capnocytophaga ochracea ATCC33596, Prevotella denticola PK1277 and Prevotella intermedia PK1511. All of these interactions were completely inhibited by N-acetylneuraminic acid. Neither N-acetylneuraminic acid nor monoclonal antibody 5H11 had any inhibitory effect on other F. nucleatum PK1594 interactions, including all galactose-inhibitable coaggregations. The results indicate that F. nucleatum PK1594 expresses upon its surface a distinct type of adhesin that mediates coaggregation interactions that are inhibited by N-acetylneuraminic acid.
TI  - Microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  - It has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. The purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. The presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. Similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. Community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. One complex consisted of the tightly related group: Bacteroides forsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola. The 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the Fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Peptostreptococcus micros. Species associated with this group included: Eubacterium nodatum, Campylobacter rectus, Campylobacter showae, Streptococcus constellatus and Campylobacter gracilis. The 3rd complex consisted of Streptococcus sanguis, S. oralis, S. mitis, S. gordonii and S. intermedius. The 4th complex was comprised of 3 Capnocytophaga species, Campylobacter concisus, Eikenella corrodens and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. The 5th complex consisted of Veillonella parvula and Actinomyces odontolyticus. A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, Selenomonas noxia and Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (A. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. The 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.
TI  - Associations of endodontic symptoms and signs with particular combinations of specific bacteria.
AB  - Significant associations have been reported between (a) specific bacterial species isolated from root canals and (b) between individual bacterial species and endodontic symptoms and signs. The prime objective of this study was to determine whether particular combinations of specific bacteria are associated with individual endodontic symptoms and signs. Seventy root canals were investigated microbiologically taking care to maintain the viability of obligate anaerobes, which accounted for 64% of the total species isolated, including Peptostreptococcus micros, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella oralis, Eubacterium aerofaciens, Eubacterium lentum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella buccae and Prevotella intermedia. Significant associations were found between individual clinical features and the following pairs of species: (a) pain (37 cases) and Peptostreptococcus spp./Prevotella spp., Peptostreptococcus spp./Prevotella melaninogenica, Pstr. micros/Prev. melaninogenica (all P < 0.01); (b) swelling (23 cases) and Pstr. micros/Prevotella spp. (P < 0.01); (c) 'Wet' canal (57 cases) and Prevotella spp./Eubacterium spp. (P < 0.01), Peptostreptococcus spp./Eubacterium spp. (P < 0.05). Thus data from this investigation suggests that statistically significant associations exist between individual endodontic symptoms and signs and particular combinations of specific bacteria.
TI  - Microbial flora of sinus tracts and root canals of non-vital teeth.
AB  - The occurrence of bacteria in 12 endodontically induced periodontal lesions associated with sinus tracts was examined. The microbial flora encountered in the sinus tract was compared with that of the root canal of the involved teeth which had not experienced any prior endodontic therapy. All microbiological samples taken from the sinus tract and from the root canal system contained bacteria. Seventy-one strains were detected in the extraradicular lesions. Of the anaerobic species, Fusobacterium nucleatum (7 strains), Prevotella intemedia (4 strains) and P. oralis (4 strains) were most frequently found. In the group of the facultative anaerobes Streptococcus spp. were predominant. Ninety-four strains were isolated from the root canal system of the 12 teeth. P. intermedia (6 strains), P. buccae (5 strains), F. nucleatum (5 strains) and Lactobacillus plantarum (5 strains) were most common. In 9 cases, species present in the root canal could be revealed in the extraradicular lesions. It was concluded that a variety of microorganisms were capable of colonizing endodontically induced, extraradicular lesions clinically characterized by sinus tracts.
TI  - Degradation of immunoglobulin G by periodontal bacteria.
AB  - Several subgingival microorganisms were tested for their ability to utilize human immunoglobulin G (IgG) as a substrate for growth. This was done using a protein-free chemically defined medium, supplemented with IgG. Stimulation of growth was observed for Capnocytophaga ochracea, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella oralis, Lactobacillus catenaforme and Streptococcus intermedius. Immunoelectrophoresis, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and a protein assay demonstrated that P. intermedia and P. endodontalis completely degraded the protein chains of IgG. Partial breakdown of IgG was observed for P. asaccharolytica and C. ochracea, whereas P. oralis cleaved the IgG heavy chain, yielding Fc and Fab fragments. All these bacteria utilized IgG as a substrate for growth. Binding studies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, revealed complete loss of in vitro antigen-antibody binding capacity after incubation of specific IgG with P. endodontalis and partial loss of binding with P. intermedia, P. gingivalis, C. ochracea or Fusobacterium nucleatum. Degradation or inactivation of IgG by oral bacteria is thought to be important in the causation of polymicrobial infections.
TI  - New findings on the microbial flora associated with adult periodontitis.
AB  - The predominant microbial flora associated with adult periodontitis was investigated in 21 patients aged 20-40 years. Microorganisms from samples of subgingival plaque were cultured on selective and non-selective media under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Ten species or groups out of a total of 31 were found to comprise the predominant cultivable flora: diphtheroids, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, coagulase-negative staphylococci, 'Streptococcus milleri'-group, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Capnocytophaga ochracea, the Prevotella veroralis/buccalis complex, P. intermedia, P. oralis and unidentified Prevotella spp. Two species previously reported at periodontitis sites, namely P. gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum, were not isolated, whereas Prevotella species accounted for the majority of isolates in this investigation. The large proportion of non-pigmented Prevotella species, P. asaccharolytica and B. ureolyticus that were found have not generally been reported previously. The role of these microorganisms and also coagulase-negative staphylococci, diphtheroids and the 'Streptococcus milleri'-group requires further investigation in adult periodontitis.
TI  - Phagocytosis of bacterial strains isolated from acute dentoalveolar abscess.
AB  - The phagocytosis by human polymorphonuclear leucocytes of 37 bacterial strains identified as Streptococcus milleri (10 strains), strictly anaerobic gram-positive cocci (10) Prevotella intermedia (6), Pr. oralis (5) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (6) was investigated in vitro. The ingestion of S. milleri and strictly anaerobic gram-positive cocci was significantly greater (p < 0.001) than that of strains of Prevotella spp. and F. nucleatum. The degree of uptake of capsulate and non-capsulate strains did not differ.
TI  - The effects of triclosan and zinc citrate, alone and in combination, on a community of oral bacteria grown in vitro.
AB  - A mixed-culture chemostat system has been used as a more stringent laboratory system for evaluation of the antimicrobial effects of Triclosan and zinc citrate. The inhibitors were added alone, and in combination, as a pulse (a high initial inhibitor concentration which decreased with time) or as a dose (concentration of inhibitor increased with time) to give maximum concentrations of 34.5 mumol/L Triclosan and 39.8 mumol/L zinc citrate. When dosed, Triclosan inhibited A. viscosus and all five Gram-negative species, whereas zinc citrate had less effect, probably due to complexation by media components. Similar effects were seen when Triclosan was pulsed, except that S. mutans was the most sensitive Gram-positive species and V. dispar was unaffected. However, when the inhibitors were dosed or pulsed in combination, marked complementary and additive inhibitory effects were observed, particularly against Gram-negative species, although S. gordonii and S. oralis were relatively unaffected. The data confirm that increased effects can be obtained with suitable combinations of antimicrobial agents and suggest that, under certain conditions, apparently broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents may be acting more selectively than hitherto suspected.
TI  - Synergistic degradation of bovine serum albumin by mutans streptococci and other  dental plaque bacteria.
AB  - Mutans streptococci (Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus) exhibited low levels of proteolytic activity against the model protein substrate, FITC-labelled bovine serum albumin, when incubated alone. Inclusion of other members of the dental plaque microflora in the assay usually resulted in marked increases in the degree of proteolysis and a high level of synergy. Interactions between mutans streptococci and either Streptococcus oralis or Fusobacterium nucleatum gave rise to the greatest degree of synergistic proteolytic degradation.
TI  - Bacteriology of dental abscesses of endodontic origin.
AB  - Aspirates have been cultured from 10 dental abscesses of endodontic origin, all of which had penetrated beyond the bony alveolus to produce fluctuant swelling. Sampling was by syringe aspiration. Strict anaerobic techniques, including the use of an anaerobic chamber, were used for serial dilution and plating. Randomly selected colonies (100) from each culture were purified, characterized, and identified. Seventy percent of the bacterial isolates were either strict anaerobes or microaerophilic. One abscess yielded a pure culture of a viridans streptococcus, Streptococcus milleri. Streptococcus intermedius dominated the flora in a second abscess. The common oral streptococcus, Streptococcus sanguis, constituted only 2% of the isolates from one additional infection. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, other Bacteroides including B. oralis and B. ruminicola, anaerobic diphtheroids, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Staphylococcus epidermis were other predominant isolates.
TI  - Circulating antibodies after experimental chronic infection in the root canal of  teeth in monkeys.
AB  - Root canals of 49 teeth with necrotic pulp tissue in five monkeys were infected with Streptococcus faecalis ss liquefaciens, Actinomyces bovis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Bacteroides oralis in various combinations. After 6 months the root canals and the periapical tissues were subjected to radiographic, bacteriologic, and histologic examinations. Signs of periapical inflammation were radiographically registered in 41 teeth, most frequently in teeth inoculated with a mixed flora. In 11 out of 16 teeth infected separately with Strep. faecalis ss liquefaciens, apical periodontitis was observed. Sera from the monkeys prior to and after the experimental inoculation were analyzed by means of gel diffusion, hemagglutination (HA), and complement binding test for antibodies against different antigen preparations of the homologous bacterial strains used for the inoculation. Detectable antibodies were seen with antigens of B. oralis in all five monkeys. Agglutinating antibodies were demonstrated with lipopolysaccharide-antigen of B. oralis in titers between 1:40 and 1:320. A marked reduction of the antibody level against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antigen after mercaptoethanol treatment indicated that a main part of the antibodies registered was of IgM-class. The study shows that certain antigens of bacterial origin from infected root canals, while affecting the periapical tissues, also stimulate the production of circulating antibodies.
TI  - Effect of bacterial contamination on cecal size and cecal contents of gnotobiotic rodents.
AB  - In the present investigation the effect of various bacterial contaminations of gnotobiotic mice and rats on cecal size is presented. Of the species tested, Bacteroides oralis and Fusobacterium nucleatum did not establish in germ-free mice. Streptococcus mutans, Clostridium difficile, a Neisseria strain and two recent cecal isolates established, but failed to exert an effect upon the cecum of mice. A group K streptococcus and B. fragilis increased the cecal size apparently by increasing the levels of water-soluble protein, peptides, and carbohydrates in the cecal contents. Mixed ileal bacteria decreased the cecal size by preventing accumulation of soluble proteins and carbohydrates in the cecum. A Peptococcus strain caused a reduction by lowering the levels of insoluble material in the cecum. When this strain was combined with two Clostridium isolates and introduced into gnotobiotic rats, 50 to 65% cecal reduction was observed. This polycontamination did not decrease the per cent water of the cecal contents but caused lower levels of both soluble and insoluble material to accumulate in the cecum. No net nitrogen absorption from the distal small intestine occurred in either the germ-free or polycontaminated rats.
