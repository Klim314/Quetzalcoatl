TI  == probiotic and technological properties of lactobacillus spp. strains from the human stomach in the search for potential candidates against gastric microbial dysbiosis.
AB  == this work characterizes a set of lactobacilli strains isolated from the stomach of healthy humans that might serve as probiotic cultures. ten different strains were recognized by rep-pcr and pfge fingerprinting among 19 isolates from gastric biopsies and stomach juice samples. these strains belonged to five species, lactobacillus gasseri (3), lactobacillus reuteri (2), lactobacillus vaginalis (2), lactobacillus fermentum (2) and lactobacillus casei (1). all ten strains were subjected to a series of in vitro tests to assess their functional and technological properties, including acid resistance, bile tolerance, adhesion to  epithelial gastric cells, production of antimicrobial compounds, inhibition of helicobacter pylori, antioxidative activity, antibiotic resistance, carbohydrate  fermentation, glycosidic activities, and ability to grow in milk. as expected, given their origin, all strains showed good resistance to low ph (3.0), with small reductions in counts after 90 min exposition to this ph. species- and strain-specific differences were detected in terms of the production of antimicrobials, antagonistic effects toward h. pylori, antioxidative activity and adhesion to gastric epithelial cells. none of the strains showed atypical resistance to a series of 16 antibiotics of clinical and veterinary importance. two l. reuteri strains were deemed as the most appropriate candidates to be used  as potential probiotics against microbial gastric disorders; these showed good survival under gastrointestinal conditions reproduced in vitro, along with strong anti-helicobacter and antioxidative activities. the two l. reuteri strains further displayed appropriated technological traits for their inclusion as adjunct functional cultures in fermented dairy products.

TI  == phenotypic characteristics and probiotic potentials of lactobacillus spp. isolated from poultry.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria, especially lactobacillus spp., have been considered as excellent probiotic microorganisms, because of their activities in  reducing the enteric diseases and maintaining healthy poultry. objectives: the current study aimed to evaluate the phenotypic characteristics and the probiotic  potentials of lactobacillus spp. isolated from poultry. materials and methods: a  total of 168 lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from healthy six and twenty-one-day old chickens and their feed samples. the isolated bacteria were identified by morphological, biochemical, and molecular tests including polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and 16s rrna gene sequencing. biochemical fingerprinting with phene plate system (ph-p) was done and the acid and bile resistant lactobacilli were subjected to the antibiotic susceptibility test. results: amongst all of the examined lab, 30.3% were resistant to bile and acid.  most of the isolated lab (57.1%) belonged to the genus lactobacillus with lactobacillus brevis (78.1%) as the dominant species followed by l. reuteri (16.6%), l. plantarum (3%), and l. vaginalis (2%). the remaining isolates were identified as pediococcus spp. (42.9%). the ph-p cluster analysis of 75 l. brevis and 16 l. reuteri strains showed high phenotypic diversity. whilst the results of ph-p typing from l. reuteri strains showed low phenotypic variations especially among the strains sensitive to acid and bile salts. conclusions: overall, the results showed that some of the high potential probiotic lab species existed in iranian poultry.

TI  == transfer of antibiotic resistance determinants between lactobacilli isolates from the gastrointestinal tract of chicken.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the potential horizontal transfer of genetic  traits for antibiotic resistance between lactobacilli isolated from the chicken gut, both in vitro and in vivo. thirty-seven lactobacillus spp. strains isolated  from the gizzard, small and large intestines and caeca of free-range broiler chickens showed multi-drug resistance as assessed by disc diffusion assays. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) for vancomycin, tetracycline, erythromycin and chloramphenicol was determined in de man, rogosa and sharpe broth in a microplate assay. almost all the lactobacilli isolates were resistant to vancomycin (except strains belonging to the lactobacillus acidophilus group) and  to tetracycline (mic>/=128 mug/ml). only five strains were resistant to erythromycin, and six to chloramphenicol. the transfer rate in filter mating experiments performed using l. acidophilus strain 4m14e (emr), lactobacillus vaginalis strain 5m14e (cmr), lactobacillus salivarius strain 5c14c (emr), and the 4g14l and 3c14c strains of lactobacillus reuteri (cmr) showed a frequency of  approximately 1x104 cfu/ml of double-resistant transconjugants for the different  combinations. the exception was the l. salivarius 5c14c (emr) and l. vaginalis 5m14e (cmr) mating combination, which produced no transconjugants. in vivo experiments performed in gnotobiotic mice by mating l. acidophilus 4m14e (emr) with l. reuteri 3c14c (cmr), l. reuteri 4g14l (cmr) or l. vaginalis 5m14e (cmr) resulted in transconjugants at 3.95+/-0.29, 3.16+/-0.33, and 4.55+/-1.52 log10 cfu/g of faeces, respectively. taken together, these data suggest that genetic exchange may occur between native bacterial strains within the gastrointestinal tract of chickens, which might maintain a dynamic gene pool conferring antibiotic resistance upon indigenous microbiota components, even in the absence of the pathogens. this possibility must be taken into account as a complementary criterion when lactobacilli are screened for probiotic use.

TI  == an in vitro protocol for direct isolation of potential probiotic lactobacilli from raw bovine milk and traditional fermented milks.
AB  == a method for isolating potential probiotic lactobacilli directly from traditional milk-based foods was developed. the novel digestion/enrichment protocol was set up taking care to minimize the protective effect of milk proteins and fats and was validated testing three commercial fermented milks containing well-known probiotic lactobacillus strains. only probiotic bacteria claimed in the label were isolated from two out of three commercial fermented milks. the application of the new protocol to 15 raw milk samples and 6 traditional fermented milk samples made it feasible to isolate 11 potential probiotic lactobacillus strains  belonging to lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, and lactobacillus vaginalis species. even though further analyses need to ascertain functional properties of these lactobacilli, the novel protocol set-up  makes it feasible to isolate quickly potential probiotic strains from traditional milk-based foods reducing the amount of time required by traditional procedures that, in addition, do not allow to isolate microorganisms occurring as sub-dominant populations.

TI  == diversity of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium in feces of herbivores, omnivores  and carnivores.
AB  == the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium population in the feces of 26 animals (16 species) were studied by culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. lactobacilli were detected from a few herbivores, all carnivores and some omnivores. lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus vaginalis and lactobacillus ingluviei were the most dominant lactobacilli in carnivores. these species were, however, not predominant in herbivores and omnivores. lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus parabuchneri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, usually present in raw plant material, were present in omnivores but not in carnivores. bifidobacteria were detected in only four herbivores and two omnivores. bifidobacterium pseudolongum was the only bifidobacterium species detected in herbivores. bifidobacteria detected in the two omnivores are phylogenetically not closely related to known species and are possible novel species in the genus.

TI  == isolation of lactobacilli with probiotic properties from the human stomach.
AB  == aims: recent evidence suggests that the human gastric microbiota is much more diverse than previously thought. the aim of this study was to assess the potential for isolating lactobacilli from the human stomach. methods and results: lactobacilli were selectively cultured from gastric biopsies from 12 patients undergoing routine endoscopy. lactobacilli were present in four of 12 biopsies. we isolated, in total 10 different strains representing five species (lactobacillus gasseri, l. fermentum, l. vaginalis, l. reuteri and l. salivarius). the 10 isolates varied greatly in their ability to inhibit the growth of two gram-positive bacteria and two gram-negative bacteria. furthermore, the acid and bile resistance profiles of the 10 isolates spanned a wide range. conclusions: five different lactobacillus species were cultured from human gastric biopsies for the first time. significance and impact of the study: diverse lactobacillus species are more prevalent in the human stomach than previously recognized, representing an untapped source of bacteria with beneficial probiotic and/or biotechnological properties.

TI  == screening of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria for potential probiotic use  in iberian dry fermented sausages.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to select lactic acid bacteria and bifibobacteria strains as potential probiotic cultures during the processing of iberian dry fermented sausages. a total of 1000 strains were isolated from iberian dry fermented sausages (363), and human (337) and pig faeces (300) in different culture media. around 30% of these strains, mainly isolated from iberian dry fermented sausages in lamvab agar, were pre-selected for testing as potential probiotics by their ability to grow adequately at the ph values and nacl concentrations of these meat products during the ripening process. of the in vitro investigations used to predict the survival of a strain in conditions present in the gastro intestinal tract, exposure to ph 2.5 showed itself to be a  highly discriminating factor with only 51 out of 312 pre-selected strains resisting adequately after 1.5h of exposure. all acid-resistant isolates identified as lactobacilli originated from human faeces (lactobacillus casei and  lactobacillus fermentum) and pig faeces (lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus animalis, lactobacillus murinus, and lactobacillus vaginalis). pediococcus acidilactici strains were isolated from iberian dry fermented sausages and pig faeces, whereas the greatest number of enterococcus strains were identified as enterococcus faecium, with this species being isolated from iberian dry fermented sausages, and human and pig faeces. most of these strains are promising probiotic meat culture candidates suitable for iberian dry fermented sausages.

TI  == changes in the predominant human lactobacillus flora during in vitro fertilisation.
AB  == background: signature matching of nucleotide sequences in the v1 and v3 regions 16s rrna genes using pyrosequencing technology is a powerful tool for typing vaginal lactobacilli to the species level and has been used for investigating the vaginal microbial niche. methods: this study has characterized the normal cultivable vaginal lactobacillus flora at varying estradiol levels in plasma; the study comprised 17 patients undergoing ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization (ivf) treatment. the vaginal status of each participant was initially assessed as normal according to amsel and nugent criteria. results: l.  crispatus, l. gasseri and/or l. jensenii were present in 10 of the patients throughout the study period, and little variation among these three species was encountered in individual patients. the flora of three women was dominated by l.  delbrueckii, l. rhamnosus or l. vaginalis. one woman exhibited a dominance of l.  iners. the flora of the remaining three women were initially dominated by l. rhamnosus or l. reuteri, but as their estrogen levels rose, their flora composition altered, to become dominated by one of the three species most common  in a normal, healthy vagina. conclusion: signature matching of nucleotide sequences in the v1 and v3 regions of 16s rrna genes is a discriminative tool for the study of vaginal lactobacilli and can be used to track the lactobacillus flora under a variety of physiological conditions.

TI  == analysis of vaginal lactic acid producing bacteria in healthy women.
AB  == vaginal lactic acid-producing bacteria of 80 pre-menopausal women were studied by isolation on blood and deman-rogosa-sharpe agar, pcr with group-specific primers  for lactobacillus-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), and pcr with specific primers for v3 region in 16s rrna-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (ttge). conventional isolation method on media detected only one  lactobacillus (lactobacillus brevis) while ttge detected only lactobacillus sp. dgge detected seven lactobacillus species; l. coleohominis, l. crispatus, l. iners, l. reuteri, l. rhamnosus, l. vaginalis, and leuconostoc lactis. l. acidophilus and l. gasseri, which are prevalent in western women, were not detected in korean women. furthermore, l. rhamnosus, leuc. lactis, l. coleohominis, and weissella cibaria, which were not previously reported in the vaginal microbiota of korean women, were detected. the five most prevalent labs in vaginal microbiota in korean women were l. iners, enterococcus faecalis, l. crispatus, leuc. lactis, and w. cibaria.

TI  == characterization of dominant cultivable lactobacilli and their antibiotic resistance profiles from faecal samples of weaning piglets.
AB  == aims: to examine the lactic acid bacteria flora of weaning piglets, to define the distribution of different lactobacilli species in piglet faecal samples, and to determine the susceptibility phenotype to 11 antibiotic of different families. methods and results: the faecal samples were taken from piglets with good herd status at 11 and 28 days after weaning. the lactobacillus isolates (n = 129) from 78 animals housed in pairs in 39 pens were preliminarily identified by their morphology and biochemical characteristics. partial 16s ribosomal dna (16s rdna)  was used to identify the isolates to the species level, and rapd (randomly amplified polymorphism dna) profiles to differentiate lactobacillus isolates to the strain level. based on these studies, 67 strains were selected for antibiotic resistant tests. the most numerous lactobacillus species found in the piglets was lactobacillus reuteri (n = 43). other lactobacilli were l. salivarius (n = 15), l. agilis (n = 4), l. johnsonii (n = 2), l. vaginalis (n = 1), l. mucosae (n = 1) and l. gallinarum (n = 1). all the strains were susceptible to chloramphenicol, ampicillin and gentamicin. two l. salivarius isolates and two l. reuteri isolates were found to be multiresistant. conclusions: this study indicates that the faecal lactobacillus flora in piglets consists mainly of l. reuteri, l. salivarius and l. acidophilus group lactobacilli, and the distribution of lactobacilli is similar between individuals of the same age and with the same diet. most of the lactobacillus isolates tested were sensitive to the antibiotics used in this study. significance and impact of the study: valuable information on lactobacillus species distribution and their antibiotic resistance profiles in piglets is obtained.

TI  == species diversity and relative abundance of vaginal lactic acid bacteria from women in uganda and korea.
AB  == aims: lactobacilli play an important role in maintaining vaginal health of women. the aim of this study was to compare the species richness and relative abundance  of lactobacillus and other lactic acid bacteria in women of two geographically distant countries, uganda and korea. methods and results: vaginal samples were obtained from two women populations in uganda and korea. the lactobacillus rogosa sl agar was used for initial isolation of lactic acid bacteria. after phenotypic  analyses, the 16s rrna gene was amplified by polymerase-chain reaction and analysed by the blast program and phylogenetic tree construction. a total of 338  (128 korean and 210 ugandan) vaginal lactic acid bacterial strains were isolated, including five genera: lactobacillus, leuconostoc, pediococcus, streptococcus and weissella. while lactobacillus crispatus was common in both populations, lactobacillus fermentum was common only in korean women, and lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus vaginalis only in ugandan women. among other lactic acid bacteria, weissella was more common in ugandan, and pediococcus in korean women. all weissella strains produced hydrogen peroxide, and all pediococcus strains inhibited candida species. conclusion: although many  lactic acid bacteria colonize women, their species distributions may be different in women of geographically separated communities. significance and impact of the  study: the knowledge of species richness and relative abundance of vaginal lactic acid bacteria, including lactobacillus, pediococcus and weissella, may lead to the design of better probiotic products as bacterial replacement therapy.

TI  == effect of lactobacillus challenge on gardnerella vaginalis biofilms.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most common infectious condition in women. it is  caused primarily by anaerobic bacteria which rapidly form biofilms recalcitrant to antibiotic treatment, elevate vaginal ph, induce inflammatory processes and displace indigenous lactobacilli from the vault. gardnerella vaginalis is commonly associated with these infections. microscopy analysis showed that within 72 h, viable g. vaginalis covered a surface area of 567 microm(2), reached a depth of 16 microm and a density of approximately 104 microm(3). they maintained  these levels for a further 3 days unless challenged with lactobacilli strains. lactobacillus reuteri rc-14 produced the biggest displacement of gardnerella. this was not due to ph, which remained between 4.7 and 5.1 for all experiments, nor by hydrogen peroxide which is produced in low amounts by strain l. reuteri rc-14, high amounts by l. crispatus 33820 and not at all by l. rhamnosus gr-1. deconvolution microscopy showed changes in structure and viability of the biofilms, with loss of dense gardnerella biofilm pods. for the first time, a strain of l. iners, the most commonly isolated vaginal lactobacillus in healthy women, was tested for potential probiotic properties. it was found to disrupt gardnerella biofilm surface area, density and depth, albeit to a lesser extent than l. reuteri rc-14. these studies help to provide insight into the clinical situation in which probiotic and indigenous vaginal lactobacilli can interfere with gardnerella's presence and reduce the risk of bacterial vaginosis.

TI  == influence of intensive and extensive breeding on lactic acid bacteria isolated from gallus gallus domesticus ceca.
AB  == in the present study, lactic acid bacteria (lab) from the cecum of chickens bred  either under intensive (commercial broilers) or extensive (free-range) conditions were isolated, identified and some of their probiotic characteristics determined. the lab identified by 16s-23s rrna pcr-ardra were mainly of lactobacillus species and to a lesser extent of enterococcus spp. for all animals. free-range chickens  showed a higher presence of lactobacillus acidophilus while lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus johnsonii were more frequently recovered from commercial broilers. lactobacillus crispatus was found only in commercial broilers, lactobacillus vaginalis and lactobacillus agilis only in free-range chickens and  lactobacillus salivarius in both types. enterococcus isolates from ceca of commercial broilers showed a higher resistance to antimicrobial drugs. lactobacillus isolates from free-range chickens presented a higher frequency of in vitro antagonistic activity against selected pathogens than from commercial broilers. all lab isolates had predominantly non-hydrophobic surfaces, but with variations depending on age of the chickens and breeding conditions. animal breeding caused variation on composition, antimicrobial susceptibility, antagonistic activity and surface hydrophobicity of lab from chicken cecum. lab isolates from ceca of free-range chickens have potential as probiotic agents, which may be used in the future as replacing the use of antimicrobials as growth  promoters.

TI  == species-specific oligonucleotide probes for the detection and identification of lactobacillus isolated from mouse faeces.
AB  == aims: to develop species-specific monitoring techniques for rapid detection and identification of lactobacillus isolated from mouse faeces. methods and results:  the specificity of oligonucleotide probes was evaluated by dot blot hybridization to 16s rdna and 23s rdna amplified by pcr from 12 lactobacillus type strains and  100 strains of lactobacillus isolated from mouse faeces. oligonucleotide probes specific for each lactobacillus species hybridized only with targeted rdna. the lactobacillus strains isolated from mouse faeces were identified mainly as lactobacillus intestinalis, l. johnsonii, l. murinus and l. reuteri using species-specific probes. 16s rdna of eight unidentified isolates were sequenced and two new probes were designed. four of eight strains of unhybridized lactobacillus were identified as l. johnsonii/gasseri group, and the remaining four strains as l. vaginalis. conclusions: the species-specific probe set of l. intestinalis, l. johnsonii, l. murinus, l. reuteri and l. vaginalis in this study was efficient for rapid identification of lactobacillus isolated from mouse faeces. significance and impact of the study: the oligonucleotide probe set for lactobacillus species harboured in the mouse intestine, can be used for rapid identification of lactobacilli and monitoring of the faecal lactobacillus community.

TI  == lactobacillus frumenti sp. nov., a new lactic acid bacterium isolated from rye-bran fermentations with a long fermentation period.
AB  == within the framework of the characterization of the microflora of an industrial sourdough fermentation, strains of lactobacillus amylovorus, lactobacillus pontis and two other strains were isolated which could not be associated with a valid species. these latter strains were gram-positive, catalase-negative, non-spore-forming, non-motile rods that could be clearly differentiated from known species by 16s rdna sequence analysis. for further characterization, the morphological, physiological (sugar fermentation, formation of dl-lactate, hydrolysis of arginine, growth temperature, co2 production) and chemotaxonomic (g+c content, cell wall composition, sds-page of whole-cell proteins) properties  were determined. fitting of the complete 16s rdna sequence into alignments of such sequences, together with the subsequent phylogenetic calculations, allowed the reconstruction of a phylogenetic tree. these data showed that the two strains were phylogenetically related but formed an independent cluster distinct from their closest neighbours, l. pontis, lactobacillus panis, lactobacillus oris, lactobacillus vaginalis and lactobacillus reuteri. the results of dna-dna hybridization experiments indicated that the two isolates represent a new lactobacillus species, for which the name lactobacillus frumenti is proposed; the type strain of this species is dsm 13145t (= lmg 19473t).

TI  == multiplex pcr for the detection of lactobacillus pontis and two related species in a sourdough fermentation.
AB  == a specific multiplex pcr assay based on the amplification of parts of the 16s rrna molecule was designed. primers derived from variable regions of the 16s rrna provided a means of easily differentiating the species lactobacillus pontis and lactobacillus panis. they could be clearly discriminated from the phylogenetically related species lactobacillus vaginalis, lactobacillus oris, and lactobacillus reuteri and from other lactobacilli commonly known to be present in sourdough. other strains isolated together with l. pontis from an industrial sourdough fermentation could be clearly separated from these species by comparative sequence analysis and construction of a specific pcr primer. for a fast identification a dna isolation protocol based on the ultrasonic lysis of cells from single colonies was developed. to demonstrate the potential of such techniques for tracking these organisms in a laboratory-scale fermentation, we combined the specific pcr assay with direct dna extraction from the organisms in  the sourdough without previous cultivation.

TI  == the identification of vaginal lactobacillus species and the demographic and microbiologic characteristics of women colonized by these species.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus has been reported to be the predominant vaginal species. vaginal lactobacilli isolated from 215 sexually active women were identified using whole-chromosomal dna probes to 20 american type culture collection lactobacillus strains. most women were colonized by l. crispatus (32%), followed by l. jensenii (23%), a previously undescribed species designated l. 1086v (15%), l. gasseri (5%), l. fermentum (0.3%), l. oris (0.3%), l. reuteri  (0.3%), l. ruminis (0.3%), and l. vaginalis (0.3%). h2o2 was produced by 95% of l. crispatus and 94% of l. jensenii isolates, compared with only 9% of l. 1086v.  colonization by l. crispatus or l. jensenii was positively associated with being  white (p<.001), age >/=20 years (p=.05), barrier contraceptive usage (p=.008), and lower frequency of bacterial vaginosis (p<.001) and gonorrhea (p=.03). l. crispatus and l. jensenii, not l. acidophilus, are the most common species of vaginal lactobacilli.

TI  == characterization of the bacterial flora of sudanese sorghum flour and sorghum sourdough.
AB  == the microflora of a sudanese sorghum flour, a spontaneously fermented sourdough and a long-term sourdough produced in a sudanese household by consecutive re-inoculations, was studied. the dominant contaminants of sorghum flour were gram-negative, catalase-positive, rod-shaped bacteria with counts of about 10(5)  cfu g-1. the spontaneously fermented sorghum sourdough showed a bacterial succession from gram-negative, catalase-positive contaminants to enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus fermentum and lact. reuteri. the total bacterial count reached about 10(10) cfu g-1 and the ph dropped from 6.4 to 3.35 in about 42 h. in this phase, only the latter two species remained dominant  in a ratio of 1:1. from the sudanese long-term dough, seven strains of lactobacillus were isolated, representing the dominant flora. sequence comparison of partial 16s rrna gene sequences were used to clarify their phylogenetic positions. five strains were classified as lact. vaginalis and could be regarded  as heterogeneous biovars of this species. the other two strains could be assigned to lact. helveticus. rapd-pcr and sugar fermentation patterns were useful in differentiation of these strains.
