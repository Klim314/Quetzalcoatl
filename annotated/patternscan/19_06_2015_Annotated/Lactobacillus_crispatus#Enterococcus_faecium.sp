TI  == animal rennets as sources of dairy lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the microbial composition of artisan and industrial animal rennet pastes was studied by using both culture-dependent and -independent approaches. pyrosequencing targeting the 16s rrna gene allowed to identify 361 operational taxonomic units (otus) to the genus/species level. among lactic acid bacteria (lab), streptococcus thermophilus and some lactobacilli, mainly lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus reuteri, were the most abundant species, with differences among the samples. twelve groups of microorganisms were targeted by viable plate counts revealing a dominance of mesophilic cocci. all rennets were able to acidify ultrahigh-temperature-processed (uht) milk as shown by ph and total titratable acidity (tta). presumptive lab isolated at the highest dilutions of acidified milks were phenotypically characterized, grouped, differentiated at  the strain level by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis, and subjected to 16s rrna gene sequencing. only 18 strains were clearly identified at the species level, as enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii, and streptococcus thermophilus, while the other strains, all belonging to the genus enterococcus, could not be allotted into any previously described species. the phylogenetic analysis showed that these strains might represent different unknown species. all strains were evaluated for their dairy technological performances. all isolates produced diacetyl, and 10 of them produced a rapid ph drop in milk,  but only 3 isolates were also autolytic. this work showed that animal rennet pastes can be sources of lab, mainly enterococci, that might contribute to the microbial diversity associated with dairy productions.

TI  == the effects of bee pollen extracts on the broiler chicken's gastrointestinal microflora.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of bee pollen ethanolic extracts on the in vivo gastrointestinal tract microflora colonization of broiler chickens. a completely randomized experiment based on six treatments (different concentrations of bee pollen - 0, 5, 15, 25, 35 and 45 g kg(-1) diet) was used during 7 weeks. the highest count of faecal enterococci was found in the experimental group with the addition of 15 g of pollen (8.85 +/- 0.87 log cfu g(-1)) per 1 kg of feed mixture. the highest count of lactobacilli was detected in the experimental group with 35 g of pollen per 1 kg of feed mixture and the highest number of the enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in the control group (8.43 +/- 0.15 log cfu g(-1)). moreover, the maldi tof ms biotyper identified the following genera: escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella  oxytoca, as well as lactobacillus acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. fermentum and l.  salivarius from the lactobacilli group and enterococcus avium, e. casseliflavus,  e. cecorum, e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. hirae and e. malodoratus from the enterococci group. additionally, the in vitro antimicrobial activities of pollen against five bacteria species isolated from gastrointestinal tracts of  chickens were tested. the best antimicrobial effect of the pollen extract was detected against k. oxytoca.

TI  == isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of elderly irish subjects.
AB  == aims: to isolate and characterize bacteriocins produced by predominant species of lactic acid bacteria from faeces of elderly subjects. methods and results: screening over 70,000 colonies, from faecal samples collected from 266 subjects,  using the indicator organisms lactobacillus bulgaricus lmg 6901 and listeria innocua dpc 3572, identified 55 antimicrobial-producing bacteria. genomic fingerprinting following apai digestion revealed 15 distinct strains. the antimicrobial activities associated with 13 of the 15 strains were sensitive to protease treatment. the predominant antimicrobial-producing species were identified as lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus and enterococcus spp. a number of previously characterized bacteriocins, including abp-118 and salivaricin b (from lact. salivarius), enterocin b (enterococcus faecium), lactacin b (lact. acidophilus),  gassericin t and a variant of gassericin a (lact. gasseri), were identified. interestingly, two antimicrobial-producing species, not generally associated with intestinally derived microorganisms were also isolated: lactococcus lactis producing nisin z and streptococcus mutans producing mutacin ii. conclusion: these data suggest that bacteriocin production by intestinal isolates against our chosen targets under the screening conditions used was not frequent (0.08%). significance and impact of the study: the results presented are important due to  growing evidence indicating bacteriocin production as a potential probiotic trait by virtue of strain dominance and/or pathogen inhibition in the mammalian intestine.

TI  == dietary inclusion of feathers affects intestinal microbiota and microbial metabolites in growing leghorn-type chickens.
AB  == feather pecking in laying hens is a serious behavioral problem that is often associated with feather eating. the intake of feathers may influence the gut microbiota and its metabolism. the aim of this study was to determine the effect  of 2 different diets, with or without 5% ground feathers, on the gut microbiota and the resulting microbial fermentation products and to identify keratin-degrading bacteria in chicken digesta. one-day-old lohmann-selected leghorn chicks were divided into 3 feeding groups: group a (control), b (5% ground feathers in the diet), and c, in which the control diet was fed until wk 12 and then switched to the 5% feather diet to study the effect of time of first  feather ingestion. the gut microbiota was analyzed by cultivation and denaturing  gradient gel electrophoresis of ileum and cecum digesta. short-chain fatty acids, ammonia, and lactate concentrations were measured as microbial metabolites. the concentration of keratinolytic bacteria increased after feather ingestion in the  ileum (p < 0.001) and cecum (p = 0.033). bacterial species that hydrolyzed keratin were identified as enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus reuteri-like species (97% sequence homology), and lactobacillus salivarius-like species (97% sequence homology). molecular analysis of cecal dna  extracts showed that the feather diet lowered the bacterial diversity indicated by a reduced richness (p < 0.001) and shannon (p = 0.012) index. the pattern of microbial metabolites indicated some changes, especially in the cecum. this study showed that feather intake induced an adaptation of the intestinal microbiota in  chickens. it remains unclear to what extent the changed metabolism of the microbiota reflects the feather intake and could have an effect on the behavior of the hens.

TI  == determination of wine microbiota using classical method, polymerase chain method  and step one real-time pcr during fermentation process.
AB  == the aim of our study was the identification of grape, must and wine microbiota during the fermentation process using a classical microbiological method and real-time pcr. the changes in different groups of microorganisms were monitored in total counts of bacteria, lactobacilli and yeasts. microbiological parameters  were observed during the current collection and processing of grapes in 2009. samples were taken during the fermentation process in wine enterprises and a private vineyard. during this period 30 samples of wine among muller thurgau, cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay, tramin and red bio-wine were examined. samples were collected from stages of grape-must unfiltered, grape-must filtered, the beginning of fermentation, fermentation, late fermentation and young wine. the highest total counts of bacteria ranged from 0.00 to 176 +/- 15 cfu.ml(-1) in the wine of muller thurgau, the highest number of yeast ranged from 0.00 to 150 +/- 9 cfu.ml(-1) in the wine of muller thurgau and the number of lactobacillus spp. ranged from 0.00 to 92 +/- 5 cfu.ml(-1) in the sample of cabernet sauvignon wine. the presence and sensitivity of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial species enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus salivarius were detected using real-time pcr (rtq pcr). susceptibility of enterococcus faecium varied in different isolates from 1 to 10(6) cfu.ml(-1), the sensitivity of the species lactobacillus acidophilus in different isolates of the wine samples ranged from 1 to 10(5) cfu.ml(-1). we also monitored representation of species lactobacillus crispatus, which were captured  by rtq pcr sensitivity and ranged from 1 to 10(5) cfu.ml(-1). identification of the species lactobacillus salivarius in each of isolates by rtq pcr method showed the presence of these bacteria in the range of 1 to 10(4) cfu.ml(-1).

TI  == inducer bacteria, unique signal peptides, and low-nutrient media stimulate in vitro bacteriocin production by lactobacillus spp. and enterococcus spp. strains.
AB  == bacteriocins (bcn) are antimicrobial peptides that provide potential to control bacterial infections in a variety of applications. we previously reported on three class iia bcn molecules produced by lactobacillus salivarius b-30514 (or-7), enterococcus faecium b-30746 (e 50-52), and enterococcus durans/faecium/hirae b-30745 (e-760). these bcn are notably effective against a wide array of pathogenic bacteria. to commercially apply such bcn, adequate quantities must be produced and harvested. we determined that a combination of host producer synthesized signal peptides (sp) in the presence of both producer and inducer bacteria grown in a dilute fermentation medium enabled marked increases in the synthesis of bcn. these sp contained 24-30 amino acid residues with sizes ranging from 2095 to 3065 da having the unique terminal carboxyl sequence of vkglt. the inducer bacterial isolates used were lactobacillus acidophilus b-30510 and lactobacillus crispatus b-30884. we used a nutrient-limited medium of 10% brucella broth (containing 0.01% glucose) to enhance bcn production. using the combination of these above three parameters enabled us to reproducibly harvest at least 200 mg of bcn/l of the spent fermentation broth. this information can be used to assist in the production of bcn.

TI  == heat shock treatment increases the frequency of loss of an erythromycin resistance-encoding transposable element from the chromosome of lactobacillus crispatus chcc3692.
AB  == a 3,165-bp chromosomally integrated transposon, designatedtn3692, of the gram-positive strain lactobacillus crispatus chcc3692 contains an erm(b) gene conferring resistance to erythromycin at concentrations of up to 250 micrograms/ml. loss of this resistance can occur spontaneously, but the rate is substantially increased by heat shock treatment. heat shock treatment at 60 degrees c resulted in an almost 40-fold increase in the frequency of erythromycin-sensitive cells (erythromycin mic, 0.047 micrograms/ml). the phenotypic change was followed by a dramatic increase in transcription of the transposase gene and the concomitant loss of an approximately 2-kb dna fragment carrying the erm(b) gene from the 3,165-bp erm transposon. in cells that were not subjected to heat shock, transcription of the transposase gene was not detectable. the upstream sequence of the transposase gene did not show any homology to known heat shock promoters in the gene data bank. significant homology (>99%) was observed between the erythromycin resistance-encoding gene from l. crispatus chcc3692 and the erm(b) genes from other gram-positive bacteria, such as streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus  faecium, and lactobacillus reuteri, which strongly indicates a common origin of the erm(b) gene for these species. the transposed dna element was not translocated to other parts of the genome of chcc3692, as determining by southern blotting, pcr analysis, and dna sequencing. no other major aberrations were observed, as judged by colony morphology, growth performance of the strain, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. these observations suggest that heat shock treatment could be used as a tool for the removal of unwanted antibiotic resistance genes harbored in transposons flanked by insertion sequence elements or transposases in lactic acid bacteria used for animal and human food production.
