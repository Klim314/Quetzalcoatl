TI  - Effects of Baseplates of Orthodontic Appliances with in situ generated Silver Nanoparticles on Cariogenic Bacteria: A Randomized, Double-blind Cross-over Clinical Trial.
AB  - AIM: Polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA) is commonly used primarily for baseplates of  orthodontic appliances (BOA). The activities of cariogenic bacteria in bioflm on these surfaces may contribute to dental caries, gingival infammation and periodontal disease. The PMMA incorporated with nanoparti-cles of silver (NanoAg-I-PMMA) and NanoAg in situ in PMMA (NanoAg-IS-PMMA) have been shown to control the growth of cariogenic bacteria, but clinical trial of anti-cariogenic application of these novel materials in orthodontics has not been evaluated. The main aim of the study is to compare the clinical effectiveness of using NanoAg-IS-PMMA and NanoAg-I-PMMA for construction of new BOA in inhibiting the planktonic growth and bioflm formation of the cariogenic bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty four patients with a median age of 12.6 years (7-15) harboring Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus and Lactobacillus acidophilus as well as Lactobacillus casei participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. The experimental BOA, NanoAg-IS-BOA and NanoAg-I-BOA, contained 0.5% w/w NanoAg while the control BOA was standard PMMA. Antibacterial effect of NanoAg-IS-BOA and NanoAg-I-BOA was assessed against test cariogenic bacteria by planktonic and bioflm bacterial cells growth inhibition. RESULTS: The average levels of test cariogenic bacteria in saliva decreased about 2 to 70 fold (30.9-98.4%) compared to baseline depending on the microorganism type and test BOA. Bioflm inhibition analysis demonstrated that NanoAg-I-BOA and NanoAg-IS-BOA inhibited the bioflm of all test bacteria by 20.1 to 79.9% compared to BOA. NanoAg-IS-BOA had a strong anti-bioflm effect against S. mutans, S. sobrinus and L. casei. However, NanoAg-I-BOA showed only slight anti-bioflm effects on test bacteria. Most notably, at all period of the clinical trial, NanoAg-IS-BOA showed a higher antibacterial activity than NanoAg-I-BOA. CONCLUSION: Based on the novel data that presented here, the NanoAg-IS-BOA had strong antimicrobial activity in the planktonic phase and subsequent bioflm formation of the cariogenic bacteria. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Wearing of NanoAg-IS-BOA has the potential to minimize dental plaque formation and caries during orthodontic treatment.
TI  - A study of the fluorescence characteristics of common cariogenic microorganisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the fluorescence characteristics of common cariogenic bacteria: Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, Prevotella intermedia, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Candida albicans. METHODS: The bacteria were cultured on brain heart infusion (BHI) agar and BHI blood agar, and bacterial colonies were collected for further amplification in liquid medium. Bacterial suspensions in physiological saline were equally divided into three parts for bacteria counting, fluorescence spectrometry detection, and fluorescence microscope examination. RESULTS: The optimal excitation wavelength of the bacteria was 350 nm; their characteristic fluorescence peak position was at 436 +/- 4 nm. There was a significant linear correlation between fluorescence intensity and bacterial concentration. The mean optical density (MOD) of S. mutans and L. acidophilus cultivated in BHI blood was significantly higher than that cultivated in BHI agar (110 +/- 10 vs. 57 +/- 20; 94 +/- 16 vs. 31 +/- 12, respectively, P < 0.05). The MOD of S. sanguis, A. viscosus, and P. intermedia cultivated in BHI blood agar was higher than that cultivated in BHI agar (37 +/- 12 vs. 36 +/- 11; 43 +/- 17 vs. 38 +/- 6; 86 +/- 21 vs. 72 +/- 8, respectively, P > 0.05); the opposite was observed for C. albicans. CONCLUSION: At 350 nm excitation wavelength, 436 +/- 4 nm is an indicator for detecting six cariogenic bacteria. The fluorescence energy, Q, is a valuable index reflecting bacterial concentration under fluorescence spectrometry detection. Exogenous fluorescence groups have greater influence on fluorescence intensity and little influence on fluorescence peak position detection.
TI  - Innate immune response of pullets fed diets supplemented with prebiotics and synbiotics.
AB  - Prebiotics and synbiotics are considered to be among the most promising replacements for in-feed antibiotic growth promoters (AGP) in poultry feed. The current study was designed to study the effect of Bacitracin methylene disalicylate (BMD) (Control), yeast-derived carbohydrates (YDC), and a blend of YDC and probiotics [Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus faecium, Bacillus subtilis, and YDC] (SNB) in the performance and innate immune response of pullets. Feed intake and BW were measured on a weekly basis. At the end of the study (d 21), 10 birds/treatment were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and ileum, cecal tonsil, and spleen samples were collected for gene expression analysis. No significant difference (P > 0.05) in feed intake and G:F was observed among treatments. In the second and third wk age, higher BW gain was observed in SNB treatment compared to control and both control and YDC treatments, respectively. Expression of TLR2b was upregulated in YDC and SNB in the ileum, and in SNB in the spleen (P < 0.05). Expression of TLR4 was downregulated in SNB in the cecal tonsil. Expression of TLR21 was downregulated in YDC in the ileum, while it was upregulated in SNB in the spleen (P < 0.05). In the ileum, YDC resulted in downregulated IL-12p35, CxCLi2, and IL-13, and SNB resulted in upregulated IL-6, interferon (IFN)-gamma, and IL-4 (P < 0.05). In the cecal tonsil, YDC resulted in upregulated IL-12p35, IL-2, IL-13 and IL-10, and SNB resulted in downregulated IL-2 and upregulated IL-13 and IL-10 (P < 0.05). In the spleen, YDC resulted in dowregulated IL-2 and CxCLi2, and SNB resulted in upregulated IL-6, IFN-gamma, IL-4, and IL-10 (P < 0.05). In conclusion, no change in performance was observed. Innate immune response analysis showed SNB with a more potent effect compared to YDC where the former showed a balanced T-helper (Th)-1/Th-2 response locally and a more Th-2-dependent response systemically; SNB might provide a more beneficial immune modulation with maintaining immune homeostasis, which was observed in a strong IL-10 response.
TI  - Distinctive Intestinal Lactobacillus Communities in Six-Month-Old Infants From Rural Malawi and South-Western Finland.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to compare the composition and diversity of Lactobacillus microbiota in infants living in Malawi and south-western Finland. METHODS: The composition and diversity of the Lactobacillus group was analyzed in the feces of healthy six-month-old infants living in rural Malawi (n = 44) and south-western Finland (n = 31), using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction method (qPCR) and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprinting (DGGE). RESULTS: Malawian infants had higher counts of lactobacilli than their Finnish counterparts (7.45 log cells/g vs. 6.86 log cells/g, p < 0.001, respectively) and the Lactobacillus community was richer and more diverse in the Malawian infants. Leuconostoc citreum and Weissella confusa were the predominant species in both study groups, but Malawian infants were more often colonized by these species (100 % vs. 74.2 % p < 0.001; 95.5 % vs. 41.9 %, p < 0.001, respectively). Moreover, Lactobacillus ruminis, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus mucosae were detected more often in the Malawian infants (59.1 % vs. 0.0 %, p < 0.001; 38.6 % vs. 9.7 %, p = 0.004; 29.5 % vs. 0.0 %, p < 0.001; 22.7 % vs. 3.2 %, p = 0.017, respectively). However, Lactobacillus casei group species were only detected in the Finnish infants. CONCLUSIONS: Malawian infants have a more abundant Lactobacillus microbiota with a distinct composition compared to Finnish infants. The environment, including diet and hygiene, may be among the factors influencing these differences.
TI  - Th1 Cytokine Production Induced by Lactobacillus acidophilus in BALB/c Mice Bearing Transplanted Breast Tumor.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The immunomodulative effects of Lactic Acid Bacteria as probiotics have been already demonstrated. OBJECTIVES: The current study aimed to evaluate the effect of oral administration of Lactobacillus acidophilus on the immune responses and patterns of cytokine production in the BALB/c mice bearing breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current study used thirty inbred BALB/c mice, six- to eight-week-old; they were divided into two groups of 15 each. One group was used as control in each assay. The L. acidophilus (ATCC4356) used in the study was inoculated in MRS broth and cultivated overnight at 37 degrees C under anaerobic conditions, then collected by centrifugation, and re-suspended in Phosphate-buffered Saline (PBS) media. After preparation of the proper amount of the suspension, it was orally administered to the mice via gavage and the control mice received an equal volume of PBS in the same manner. RESULTS: The results showed that oral administration of L. acidophilus as a potent immunostimulator agent could motivate the proliferation of immune cells. Moreover, it could increase the production of IFN-gamma and decrease the production of IL-4, known as Th2 cytokines, in the spleen cell culture. The results showed that the survival time of the L. acidophilus administered mice significantly increased in comparison to that of the control mice. CONCLUSIONS: The current study findings suggested that L. acidophilus can promote immune responses with Th1 bias and may increase the antitumor response. Further, the consumption of this probiotic strain may help to manage the immune response in tumor condition, but more studies are needed to investigate the other mechanisms of this effect.
TI  - The Effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus on the Intestinal Smooth Muscle Contraction through PKC/MLCK/MLC Signaling Pathway in TBI Mouse Model.
AB  - Clinical studies have shown that probiotics influence gastrointestinal motility.  However, the molecular mechanisms by which probiotic Lactobacillus modulates intestinal motility in traumatic brain injury (TBI) mouse model have not been explored. In the present study, we provided evidence showing that treatment of TBI mice with Lactobacillus acidophilus significantly improved the terminal ileum villus morphology, restored the impaired interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) and the disrupted ICC networks after TBI, and prevented TBI-mediated inhibition of contractile activity in intestinal smooth muscle. Mechanistically, the decreased concentration of MLCK, phospho-MLC20 and phospho-MYPT1 and increased concentration of MLCP and PKC were observed after TBI, and these events mediated by TBI were efficiently prevented by Lactobacillus acidophilus application. These findings may provide a novel mechanistic basis for the application of Lactobacillus acidophilus in the treatment of TBI.
TI  - Jaeumganghwa-Tang Induces Apoptosis via the Mitochondrial Pathway and Lactobacillus Fermentation Enhances Its Anti-Cancer Activity in HT1080 Human Fibrosarcoma Cells.
AB  - Jaeumganghwa-tang (JGT, Zi-yin-jiang-huo-tang in Chinese and Jiin-koka-to in Japanese) is an oriental herbal formula that has long been used as a traditional medicine to treat respiratory and kidney diseases. Recent studies revealed that JGT exhibited potent inhibitory effects on allergies, inflammation, pain, convulsions, and prostate hyperplasia. Several constituent herbs in JGT induce apoptotic cancer cell death. However, the anti-cancer activity of JGT has not been examined. In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer effects of JGT using highly tumorigenic HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. In addition, we examined whether the Lactobacillus fermentation of JGT enhanced its anti-cancer activity using an in vivo xenograft model because fermentation of herbal extracts is thought to strengthen their therapeutic effects. Data revealed that JGT suppressed the growth of cancer cells efficiently by stimulating G1 cell cycle arrest and then inducing apoptotic cell death by causing mitochondrial damage and activating caspases. The phosphorylation of p38 and ERK also played a role in JGT-induced cell death. In vitro experiments demonstrated that JGT fermented with Lactobacillus acidophilus, designated fJGT162, elicited similar patterns of cell death as did non-fermented JGT. Meanwhile, the daily oral administration of 120 mg/kg fJGT162 to HT1080-bearing BALB/c nude mice suppressed tumor growth dramatically (up to 90%) compared with saline treatment, whereas the administration of non-fermented JGT suppressed tumor growth by ~70%. Collectively, these results suggest that JGT and fJGT162 are safe and useful complementary and alternative anti-cancer herbal therapies, and that Lactobacillus fermentation improves the in vivo anti-cancer efficacy of JGT significantly.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 Lactobacillus and three Bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. Agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (pH 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; CFS) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; CFW) from de Man-Rogosa-Sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. Acid CFS and CFW showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against C. albicans. Neutralized CFS/CFW assays showed six strains active against S. aureus (L. acidophilus L-1, L. brevis 1, L. fermentum 1, B. animalis subsp. lactis L-3), E. coli (L. bulgaricus 6) or B. cereus (L. plantarum 24-4capital VE, Cyrillic). Inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized CFS (L. bulgaricus 6, L. helveticus 3, L. plantarum 24-2L, L. fermentum 1)/CFW (L. plantarum 24-5D, L. plantarum 24-4capital VE, Cyrillic) was detected. Some strains maintained activity after pH neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. The antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the Epsilometer test method. All strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. Four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (L. rhamnosus Lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (L. acidophilus L-1 and L. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; L. casei L-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). Vancomycin MICs > 256 mug/mL indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. The antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of antiseptic mouthrinses on Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis and Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  
TI  - Production of 13S-hydroxy-9(Z)-octadecenoic acid from linoleic acid by whole recombinant cells expressing linoleate 13-hydratase from Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Linoleate 13-hydratase from Lactobacillus acidophilus LMG 11470 converted linoleic acid to hydroxyl fatty acid, which was identified as 13S-hydroxy-9(Z)-octadecenoic acid (13-HOD) by GC-MS and NMR. The expression of linoleate 13-hydratase gene in Escherichia coli was maximized by using pACYC plasmid and super optimal broth with catabolite repression (SOC) medium containing 40mM Mg2+. To optimize induction conditions, recombinant cells were cultivated at 37 degrees C, 1mM isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added at 2h, and the culture was further incubated at 16 degrees C for 18h. Recombinant cells expressing linoleate 13-hydratase from L. acidophilus were obtained under the optimized expression conditions and used for 13-HOD production from linoleic acid. The optimal reaction conditions were pH 6.0, 40 degrees C, 0.25% (v/v) Tween 40, 25gl-1 cells, and 100gl-1 linoleic acid, and under these conditions, whole recombinant cells produced 79gl-1 13-HOD for 3h with a conversion yield of 79% (w/w), a volumetric productivity of 26.3gl-1h-1, and a specific productivity of 1.05g g-cells-1h-1. To the best of our knowledge, the recombinant cells produced hydroxy fatty acid with the highest concentration and productivity reported so far.
TI  - Molecular identification and quantification of lactic acid bacteria in traditional fermented dairy foods of Russia.
AB  - Russian traditional fermented dairy foods have been consumed for thousands of years. However, little research has focused on exploiting lactic acid bacteria (LAB) resources and analyzing the LAB composition of Russian traditional fermented dairy foods. In the present study, we cultured LAB isolated from fermented mare and cow milks, sour cream, and cheese collected from Kalmykiya, Buryats, and Tuva regions of Russia. Seven lactobacillus species and the Bifidobacterium genus were quantified by quantitative PCR. The LAB counts in these samples ranged from 3.18 to 9.77 log cfu/mL (or per gram). In total, 599 LAB strains were obtained from these samples using de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe agar and M17 agar. The identified LAB belonged to 7 genera and 30 species by 16S rRNA and murE gene sequencing and multiplex PCR assay. The predominant LAB isolates were Lactobacillus helveticus (176 strains) and Lactobacillus plantarum (63 strains), which represented 39.9% of all isolates. The quantitative PCR results revealed that counts of 7 lactobacilli species and Bifidobacterium spp. of 30 fermented cow milk samples ranged from 1.19 +/- 0.34 (Lactobacillus helveticus in Tuva) to 8.09 +/- 0.71 (Lactobacillus acidophilus in Kalmykiya) log cfu/mL of fermented cow milk (mean +/- standard error). The numbers of Bifidobacterium spp., Lb. plantarum, Lb. helveticus, and Lb. acidophilus revealed no significant difference between the 3 regions; nevertheless, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus sakei, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus exhibited different degrees of variation across 3 regions. The results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of Russia have complex compositions of LAB species. The diversity of LAB might be related to the type of fermented dairy product, geographical origin, and manufacturing process.
TI  - Bacteriological evaluation of Allium sativum oil as a new medicament for pulpotomy of primary teeth.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of Allium sativum oil and formocresol on the pulp tissue of the pulpotomized teeth. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty children were selected for this study. All children had a pair of non-vital primary molars. A sterile paper point was dipped in the root canals prior to the mortal pulpotomy. These paper points were collected in transfer media and immediately transported to the microbiological lab to be investigated microbiologically (for Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus). Then the procedure of mortal pulpotomy was performed. After 2 weeks, the cotton pellets were removed and sterile paper points were dipped in the root canals for microbiological examination. Then comparison between the count of bacteria before and after treatment was conducted. Statistical analysis was performed using independent t-test and paired t-test at the significance level of alpha = 0.05. RESULTS: After application of both medicaments, there was a marked decrease in S. mutans and L. acidophilus counts. The difference between the mean of log values of the count before and after the application was highly significant for both medicaments (P < 0.05); however, better results were obtained when A. sativum oil was used. CONCLUSION: A. sativum oil had more powerful antimicrobial effects than formocresol on the bacteria of the infected root canals.
TI  - Treatment of pediatric diarrhea: a simulated client study at private pharmacies of Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, India.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In low- and middle-income countries such as India, private pharmacies play an important role in medical treatments, offering advice for common illnesses such as diarrhea and respiratory tract infections. There is a need to explore the details of the dispensing practices at the private pharmacies in low- and middle-income countries. METHODOLOGY: The present study used simulated client methodology to assess the actual dispensing practices for patients with pediatric diarrhea at private pharmacies in an urban setting of an Indian province. RESULTS: This study identified 164 private pharmacies (84.10%) in the study setting that engaged in the practice of dispensing prescription drugs without prescriptions. Only about 40% asked clients if they had a prescription from a doctor. The average duration of consultations at the pharmacies was 1.3 minutes (range, 0.5-6 minutes). The dispensing of drugs was not in compliance with the recommended guidelines and regulations. The most commonly dispensed drugs were antibiotics (40.24%); of these, quinolones either alone or in combination with imidazoles were the most frequently dispensed. The other commonly dispensed drugs were antimotility drugs (31.10%) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (probiotics; 23.17%). The drugs were dispensed in inappropriate doses due to the absence of indications. CONCLUSIONS: Overuse and misuse of all these prescription drugs dispensed by pharmacies pose significant issues, such as resistance, dangerous side effects, and high costs. At the same time, the pharmacies did not dispense recommended drugs such as oral rehydration solution and zinc, which they are authorized to dispense without a prescription.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of antiseptic mouthrinses on Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis and Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral antiseptics are valuable in controlling oral infections caused by cariogenic bacteria. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of mouthrinses and pure antiseptic compounds on Streptococcus mutans and non-mutans bacteria (Streptococcus sanguinis and Lactobacillus acidophilus). METHODS: The agar diffusion assay was employed to determine bacterial growth inhibition. RESULTS: Commercial mouthrinses containing chlorhexidine gluconate (0.2%), cetylpyridinium chloride (0.05%) and sodium fluoride (0.05%) produced statistically similar growth inhibition of S. mutans, S. sanguinis and L. acidophilus (with zones of inhibition ranging from 7.56 +/- 0.52 mm to 7.39 +/- 0.53 mm, 17.44 +/- 0.94 mm to 18.31 +/- 0.62 mm and 8.61 +/- 1.43 to 8.67 +/- 1.43 mm respectively, p > 0.05). The chlorhexidine mouthwash produced the greatest mean growth inhibition of S. sanguinis and S. mutans compared to all other mouthrinses tested (p < 0.01). The minimum concentrations at which inhibition against S. mutans could be detected were chlorhexidine gluconate at 0.005% (wt/vol), cetylpyridinium chloride 0.01% (wt/ vol), povidone iodine 10% (wt/vol) and sodium hypochlorite 0.5% (vol/vol). CONCLUSIONS: Chlorhexidine (0.01%), cetylpyridinium chloride (0.01%), povidone iodine (10%) and sodium hypochlorite (0.5%) are effective at inhibiting the growth of S. mutans, S. sanguinis and L. acidophilus.
TI  - Divergent signaling pathways regulate IL-12 production induced by different species of Lactobacilli in human dendritic cells.
AB  - Recent studies have indicated that different strains of Lactobacilli differ in their ability to regulate IL-12 production by dendritic cells (DCs), as some strains are stronger inducer of IL-12 while other are not and can even inhibit IL-12 production stimulated by IL-12-inducer Lactobacilli. In this report we demonstrate that Lactobacillus reuteri 5289, as previously described for other strains of L. reuteri, can inhibit DC production of IL-12 induced by Lactobacilllus acidophilus NCFM. Remarkably, L. reuteri 5289 was able to inhibit IL-12 production induced not only by Lactobacilli, as so far reported, but also by bacteria of different genera, including pathogens. We investigated in human DCs the signal transduction pathways involved in the inhibition of IL-12 production induced by L. reuteri 5289, showing that this potential anti-inflammatory activity, which is also accompanied by an elevated IL-10 production, is associated to a prolonged phosphorilation of ERK1/2 MAP kinase pathway. Improved understanding of the immune regulatory mechanisms exerted by Lactobacilli is crucial for a more precise employment of these commensal bacteria as probiotics in human immune-mediated pathologies, such as allergies or inflammatory bowel diseases.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus suppresses colitis-associated activation of the IL-23/Th17 axis.
AB  - The aim of this paper is to determine the modulatory effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus on the IL-23/Th17 immune axis in experimental colitis. DSS-induced mouse models of UC were to be saline, hormones, and different concentrations of Lactobacillus acidophilus intervention. The expression of interleukin- (IL-) 17, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), IL-23, transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and phosphorylated (p)-STAT3 was examined by RT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemical analysis. And the results showed that administration of L. acidophilus suppressed Th17 cell-mediated secretion of proinflammatory cytokine IL-17 through downregulation of IL-23 and TGFbeta1 expression and downstream phosphorylation of p-STAT3.
TI  - A novel unsaturated fatty acid hydratase toward C16 to C22 fatty acids from Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Hydroxy FAs, one of the gut microbial metabolites of PUFAs, have attracted much attention because of their various bioactivities. The purpose of this study was to identify lactic acid bacteria with the ability to convert linoleic acid to hydroxy FAs. A screening process revealed that a gut bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus NTV001 converts linoleic acid mainly into 13-hydroxy-cis-9-octadecenoic acid, and resulted in the identification of the hydratase responsible, FA-HY1. Recombinant FA-HY1 was purified and its enzymatic characteristics were investigated. FA-HY1 could convert not only C18 PUFAs but also C20 and C22 PUFAs. C18 PUFAs with a cis carbon-carbon double bond at the Delta12 position were converted into the corresponding 13-hydroxy FAs. Arachidonic acid and DHA were converted into the corresponding 15-hydroxy FA and 14-hydroxy FA, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a bacterial FA hydratase that can convert C20 and C22 PUFAs into the corresponding hydroxy FAs. These novel hydroxy FAs produced by using FA-HY1 should contribute to elucidate the bioactivities of hydroxy FAs.
TI  - Donkey Milk for Manufacture of Novel Functional Fermented Beverages.
AB  - The aim of this work was to investigate on the functional features of a donkey milk probiotic berevage as a novel food. Particularly, it was to study the decrease of lactose content and the antioxidant activity of standard yogurt (YC) and probiotic yogurt (YP; Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei) from donkey milk during the storage up to 30 d at 4 masculineC. The evolution of lactose content using enzymatic-spectrophotometric kits was analyzed. Antioxidant activity of yogurt was measured using 2,2'-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and thiol assays. Parallel consumer sensory studies were carried out as consumer test in order to gain information about the impact of these novel fermented beverages on sensory perceptions. The statistical analysis has shown significant effect of studied factors. The results showed that the lactose content gradually decreased during storage in both yogurts, reaching values of 2.36% and 2.10% in YC and YP, respectively, at 30 d (P < 0.05). During storage of both yogurt types, the antioxidant activity increased, but YP showed a higher antioxidant activity than YC. The results suggest that the antioxidant activity of yogurt samples was affected by cultures of lactic acid bacteria (LAB). We conclude that the fermented donkey milk could be configured as health and nutraceutical food, which aims to meet nutritional requirements of certain consumers groups with lactose or cow milk protein intolerance.
TI  - The Differential Proteome of the Probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM Grown on the Potential Prebiotic Cellobiose Shows Upregulation of Two beta -Glycoside Hydrolases.
AB  - Probiotics, prebiotics, and combinations thereof, that is, synbiotics, are known  to exert beneficial health effects in humans; however interactions between pro- and prebiotics remain poorly understood at the molecular level. The present study describes changes in abundance of different proteins of the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM (NCFM) when grown on the potential prebiotic cellobiose as compared to glucose. Cytosolic cell extract proteomes after harvest at late exponential phase of NCFM grown on cellobiose or glucose were analyzed by two dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) in the acidic (pH 4-7) and the alkaline (pH 6-11) regions showing a total of 136 spots to change in abundance. Proteins were identified by MS or MS/MS from 81 of these spots representing 49 unique proteins and either increasing 1.5-13.9-fold or decreasing 1.5-7.8-fold in relative abundance. Many of these proteins were associated with energy metabolism, including the cellobiose related glycoside hydrolases phospho-beta-glucosidase (LBA0881) and phospho-beta-galactosidase II (LBA0726). The data provide insight into the utilization of the candidate prebiotic cellobiose by the probiotic bacterium NCFM. Several of the upregulated or downregulated identified proteins associated with utilization of cellobiose indicate the presence of carbon catabolite repression and regulation of enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism.
TI  - A Randomized Double-blind Controlled Trial of Lactobacillus acidophilus Plus Bifidobacterium bifidum versus Placebo in Patients with Hypercholesterolemia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Not all patients respond well to traditional cholesterol lowering medications. Probiotics have been evaluated for their cholesterol-lowering effects in humans with variable results. This study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of two probiotics in lowering the serum cholesterol of hypercholesterolemic patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized double-blind controlled trial was conducted comparing placebo to Lactobacillus acidophilus plus Bifidobacterium bifidum in patients diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia. Placebo or probiotic capsules were taken three times daily for six weeks. Pre- and post-treatment total cholesterol (TC), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride (TG) levels and demographic parameters of the two groups were compared. From a total of 70 participants, 64 completed the assigned treatment (31 in probiotics group and 33 in the control group).The two treatment groups were matched for age, sex, weight, height, BMI, waist and hip circumferences, and blood pressure. RESULTS: Baseline evaluation revealed no difference between the probiotics group and control group levels of TC, HDL-C, LDL-C and TG. TC levels in the probiotics group decreased during treatment (237.2 vs. 212.7 mg/dL, p<0.05). TC and LDL-C levels in the control group increased significantly from their baseline levels during treatment. TC (212.7 vs 252.8 mg/dL, p<0.001), HDL-C (52.0 vs 59.1 mg/dL, p=0.04) and LDL-C (153.9 vs 182.1 mg/dL, p<0.01) levels in the probiotics group were significantly lower at the end of treatment than the corresponding levels in the control group. CONCLUSION: A combination of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum decreased serum total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol levels in hypercholesterolemic patients over a six week period. There was no effect on serum triglyceride or fasting blood glucose levels.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of filling materials used in primary teeth pulpotomy.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial activity of pulp capping materials used in primary teeth (formocresol [FC], zinc oxide and eugenol cement [ZOE], ZOE mixed with FC [ZOEFC], mineral trioxide aggregate [MTA] and calcium hydroxide [CH]) against cariogenic bacteria. The agar plate diffusion test was used for the cultures, including saline solution as a negative control. A base layer of 15 mL of brain heart infusion agar was inoculated with 300 mL of each inoculum. Twelve wells were made and completely filled with one of the testing materials for each bacteria strain. The plates were incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 h. Zones of microbial inhibition and material diffusion were measured and photographed. The results obtained were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney non-parametric tests. Respectively, the medium zones of bacteria inhibition of FC, ZOE, ZOEFC, MTA and CH against Streptococcus mutans growth were 28.5, 15.2, 20.8, 9.3 and 11.6; against Lactobacillus acidophilus growth were 28.7, 14.8, 15.3, 15.2 and 20.0, and against Actinomyces viscosus growth were 13.6, 13.5, 14.7, 10.0 and 13.6. We might confirmed the high antibacterial activity of FC solution, especially against S. mutans and L. acidophilus, as wells as, the low inhibitory effect of MTA cement on the cariogenic bacteria studied.
TI  - Unveiling of novel regio-selective fatty acid double bond hydratases from Lactobacillus acidophilus involved in the selective oxyfunctionalization of mono- and di-hydroxy fatty acids.
AB  - The aim of this study is the first time demonstration of cis-12 regio-selective linoleate double-bond hydratase. Hydroxylation of fatty acids, abundant feedstock in nature, is an emerging alternative route for many petroleum replaceable products thorough hydroxy fatty acids, carboxylic acids, and lactones. However, chemical route for selective hydroxylation is still quite challenging owing to low selectivity and many environmental concerns. Hydroxylation of fatty acids by hydroxy fatty acid forming enzymes is an important route for selective biocatalytic oxyfunctionalization of fatty acids. Therefore, novel fatty acid hydroxylation enzymes should be discovered. The two hydratase genes of Lactobacillus acidophilus were identified by genomic analysis, and the expressed two recombinant hydratases were identified as cis-9 and cis-12 double-bond selective linoleate hydratases by in vitro functional validation, including the identification of products and the determination of regio-selectivity, substrate specificity, and kinetic parameters. The two different linoleate hydratases were the involved enzymes in the 10,13-dihydroxyoctadecanoic acid biosynthesis. Linoleate 13-hydratase (LHT-13) selectively converted 10 mM linoleic acid to 13S-hydroxy-9(Z)-octadecenoic acid with high titer (8.1 mM) and yield (81%). Our study will expand knowledge for microbial fatty acid-hydroxylation enzymes and facilitate the designed production of the regio-selective hydroxy fatty acids for useful chemicals from polyunsaturated fatty acid feedstocks.

TI  - Lactobacillus species: taxonomic complexity and controversial susceptibilities.
AB  - The genus Lactobacillus is a taxonomically complex and is composed of over 170 species that cannot be easily differentiated phenotypically and often require molecular identification. Although they are part of the normal human gastrointestinal and vaginal flora, they can also be occasional human pathogens. They are extensively used in a variety of commercial products including probiotics. Their antimicrobial susceptibilities are poorly defined in part because of their taxonomic complexity and are compounded by the different methods recommended by Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute and International Dairy Foundation. Their use as probiotics for prevention of Clostridium difficile infection is prevalent among consumers worldwide but raises the question of will the use of any concurrent antibiotic effect their ability to survive. Lactobacillus species are generally acid resistant and are able to survive ingestion. They are generally resistant to metronidazole, aminoglycosides and ciprofloxacin with L. acidophilus being susceptible to penicillin and vancomycin, whereas L. rhamnosus and L. casei are resistant to metronidazole and vancomycin.
TI  - A Decade of Experience in Primary Prevention of Clostridium difficile Infection at a Community Hospital Using the Probiotic Combination Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285, Lactobacillus casei LBC80R, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus CLR2 (Bio-K+).
AB  - In August 2003, the 284-bed community hospital Pierre-Le Gardeur (PLGH) in Quebec experienced a major outbreak associated with the Clostridium difficile NAP1/027/BI strain. Augmented standard preventive measures (SPMs) were not able to control this outbreak. It was decided in February 2004 to give to every adult inpatient on antibiotics, without any exclusion, a probiotic (Bio-K+: Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285, Lactobacillus casei LBC80R, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus CLR2) within 12 hours of the antibiotic prescription. Augmented SPMs were continued. The use of the probiotic in addition to SPMs was associated with a marked reduction of C. difficile infection (CDI). During the 10 years of observation, 44 835 inpatients received Bio-K+, and the CDI rate at PLGH declined from 18.0 cases per 10 000 patient-days and remained at low mean levels of 2.3 cases per 10 000 patient-days. Additionally, 10-year data collected by the Ministry of Health in Quebec comparing the CDI rate between Quebec hospitals showed that CDI rates at PLGH were consistently and continuously lower compared with those at similar hospitals. Blood cultures were monitored at PLGH for Lactobacillus bacteremia through the 10 years' experience, and no Lactobacillus bacteremias were detected. Despite the limitation of an observational study, we concluded that the probiotic Bio-K+ was safe and effective in decreasing our primary CDI rate.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285, Lactobacillus casei LBC80R, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus CLR2 (Bio-K+): Characterization, Manufacture, Mechanisms of Action, and Quality Control of a Specific Probiotic Combination for Primary Prevention of Clostridium difficile Infection.
AB  - A specific probiotic formulation composed of Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285, Lactobacillus casei LBC80R, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus CLR2 (Bio-K+) has been marketed in North America since 1996. The strains and the commercial products have been evaluated for safety, identity, gastrointestinal survival, and stability throughout shelf life. The capacity of both the fermented beverages and the capsules to reduce incidences of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has been demonstrated in human clinical trials. Individual strains and the finished products have shown antimicrobial activity against C. difficile and toxin A/B neutralization capacity in vitro. The use of this specific probiotic formulation as part of a bundle of preventive measures to control CDI in healthcare settings is discussed.
TI  - Cost effectiveness of cryoprotective agents and modified De-man Rogosa Sharpe medium on growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - The effect of cryoprotective agents (namely, sodium chloride, sucrose, dextran, sorbitol, monosodium glutamate, glycerol, skim milk and skim milk with malt extract) and modified De-Man Rogosa Sharpe (MRS) medium, on the viability and stability of L. acidophilus ATCC 4962, was investigated. The modified MRS medium was not only economical, but it gave a relatively higher yield of L. acidophilus ATCC 4962 than the commercial MRS. Monosodium glutamate, skim milk and skim milk with malt extract provided significantly higher viable counts, with optimum concentration at 0.3%. Nevertheless, at concentration above 0.5%, there was a reduction in cell viability, which could be attributed to cell shrinkage associated with osmotic pressure changes inside the cells. It was also found that L. acidophilus ATCC 4962 was stable at 28 degrees C for eight weeks. Skim milk demonstrated a significant growth of probiotics. Skim milk was the preferred cryoprotective agent, as it is of low cost, easily available and demonstrated a significant growth of probiotics. In conclusion, modified MRS medium with skim milk is suggested for the remarkable growth and yield of L. acidophilus.
TI  - Secreted Metabolites of Bifidobacterium infantis and Lactobacillus acidophilus Protect Immature Human Enterocytes from IL-1beta-Induced Inflammation: A Transcription Profiling Analysis.
AB  - Combination regimens of Bifidobacterium infantis and Lactobacillus acidophilus have been demonstrated to prevent necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in clinical trials. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this protective effect are not well understood. Additionally, conditioned media from individual cultures of these two probiotics show strain specific modulation of inflammation using in vitro human intestinal NEC models. Here we report a transcription profiling analysis of gene expression in immature human fetal intestinal epithelial cells (H4 cells) pretreated with conditioned media from B. infantis (BCM) or L. acidophilus (LCM) prior to IL-1beta stimulation. Compared with control media, the two probiotic-conditioned media (PCM) treatments altered the expression of hundreds of genes involved in the immune response, apoptosis and cell survival, cell adhesion, the cell cycle, development and angiogenesis. In IL-1beta-stimulated cells, PCM treatment decreased the upregulation of genes in the NF-kappaB activation pathway and downregulated genes associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. Compared with LCM, BCM showed more significant modulatory effects on ECM remodeling, reflected by a lower p value. IL-6 and IL-8 production was significantly reduced in IL-1beta-stimulated cells pretreated with PCM (p<0.05), which was consistent with their altered gene expression. Western blot analysis showed that compared with IL-1beta stimulation alone, PCM treatment attenuated the decrease of cytoplasmic IkappaBalpha and NF-kappaB p65 levels as well as the increase of nuclear NF-kappaB p65 levels in the stimulated cells (p<0.05). In conclusion, PCM treatment exerted anti-inflammatory effects in immature human fetal enterocytes primarily by modulating genes in the NF-kappaB signaling and ECM remodeling pathways. Additionally, some components of these signaling pathways, particularly the ECM remodeling pathway, were more profoundly affected by BCM than LCM.
TI  - Effect of probiotic fermented milk (kefir) on glycemic control and lipid profile  in type 2 diabetic patients: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a global health problem in the world. Probiotic food has  anti-diabetic property. The aim of this trial was to determine the effect of probiotic fermented milk (kefir) on glucose and lipid profile control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted on 60 diabetic patients aged 35 to 65 years.Patients were randomly and equally (n=30) assigned to consume either probiotic fermented milk (kefir) or conventional fermented milk (dough) for 8 weeks. Probiotic group consumed 600 ml/day probiotic fermented milk containing Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacteria and control group consumed 600 ml/day conventional fermented milk.Blood samples tested for fasting blood glucose, HbA1C, triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol, HDL-C and LDL-C at the baseline and end of the study. RESULTS: The comparison of fasting blood glucose between two groups after intervention was statistically significant (P=0.01). After intervention, reduced HbA1C compared with the baseline value in probiotic fermented milk group was statistically significant (P=0.001), also the HbA1C level significantly decreased in probiotic group in comparison with control group (P=0.02) adjusting for serum levels of glucose, baseline values of HbA1c and energy intake according to ANCOVA model. Serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and HDL- cholesterol levels were not shown significant differences between and within the groups after intervention. CONCLUSION: Probiotic fermented milk can be useful as a complementary or adjuvant therapy in the treatment of diabetes.
TI  - [Screening, combination of microbial deodorizer and the optimization of its deodorizing conditions].
AB  - In order to obtain the candidate strains of deodorizing microorganism, three optimization strains with relatively higher deodorizing capacity were isolated from landfill leachate, which were given the labels of CC3, CC7, CC13 and CC16. According to the results of morphological observation, physiological and biochemical tests, 16S rDNA sequence homology analysis, the strains CC3, CC7, CC13 and CC16 were identified as Pediococcus acidilactici, Bacillus megaterium, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Alcaligenes faecalis respectively. When the strains CC7, CC13 and CC16 were mixed with the inoculation rate was 1:1.5:0.5, the removal rates of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide were 83.56% and 70.25%. The optimal conditions of deodorizing by single factor test were deodorization time of 60 hours, sausage of 5%, temperature of 30 degrees C, initial pH of 6.5.
TI  - A Four-Probiotics Regimen Reduces Postoperative Complications After Colorectal Surgery: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heterogeneous results of published studies led to conduct a randomized clinical trial to assess the efficacy of a new formulation of four probiotics as prophylaxis for complications after colorectal surgery. METHODS: A double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized study was conducted enrolling patients undergoing colorectal surgery for cancer. Capsules of placebo or of a formulation containing Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. p lantarum, Bifidobacterium lactis and Saccharomyces boulardii were administered starting one day before operation and continuing for another 15 days postoperatively. Patients were followed up for 30 days with the development of postoperative complications as the primary outcome. Gene expression and serum levels of cytokines were measured on postoperative day 4 ( www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT02313519). RESULTS: The study was prematurely stopped after enrolment due to efficacy in the primary outcome. Administration of probiotics significantly decreased the rate of all postoperative major complication (28.6 vs. 48.8 % of the placebo arm, p 0.010, odds ratio 0.42). Major benefit was found in the reduction of the rate of postoperative pneumonia (2.4 vs. 11.3 %, p 0.029), of surgical site infections (7.1 vs. 20.0 %, p 0.020) and of anastomotic leakage (1.2 vs. 8.8 %, p 0.031). The time until hospital discharge was shortened as well. Gene expression of SOCS3 was positively related with gene expression of TNF and of circulating IL-6 in the probiotic group but not in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: The studied probiotic formulation significantly decreased the risk of postoperative complications, namely mechanical ventilation, infections and anastomotic leakage. Modulation of the gene expression of SOCS3 is one suggested mechanism ( www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT02313519).
TI  - A randomized controlled trial to test the effect of multispecies probiotics on cognitive reactivity to sad mood.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent insights into the role of the human microbiota in cognitive and affective functioning have led to the hypothesis that probiotic supplementation may act as an adjuvant strategy to ameliorate or prevent depression. OBJECTIVE: Heightened cognitive reactivity to normal, transient changes in sad mood is an established marker of vulnerability to depression and is considered an important target for interventions. The present study aimed to test if a multispecies probiotic containing Bifidobacterium bifidum W23, Bifidobacterium lactis W52, Lactobacillus acidophilus W37, Lactobacillus brevis W63, Lactobacillus casei W56, Lactobacillus salivarius W24, and Lactococcus lactis (W19 and W58) may reduce cognitive reactivity in non-depressed individuals. DESIGN: In a triple-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, pre- and post-intervention assessment design, 20 healthy participants without current mood disorder received a 4-week probiotic food-supplement intervention with the multispecies probiotics, while 20 control participants received an inert placebo for the same period. In the pre- and post-intervention assessment, cognitive reactivity to sad mood was assessed using the revised Leiden index of depression sensitivity scale. RESULTS: Compared to participants who received the placebo intervention, participants who received the 4-week multispecies probiotics intervention showed a significantly reduced overall cognitive reactivity to sad mood, which was largely accounted for by reduced rumination and aggressive thoughts. CONCLUSION: These results provide the first evidence that the intake of probiotics may help reduce negative thoughts associated with sad mood. Probiotics supplementation warrants further research as a potential preventive strategy for depression.
TI  - Effect of Probiotic Containing Ice-cream on Salivary Mutans Streptococci (SMS) Levels in Children of 6-12 Years of Age: A Randomized Controlled Double Blind Study with Six-months Follow Up.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the caries risk based on the salivary levels of streptococcus mutans in children of 6-12 years of age group before and after consuming probiotic ice-cream containing Bifidobacterium lactis Bb-12 and Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A double blind, placebo controlled trial was carried out in 60 children aged between 6 to 12 years with zero decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT). They were randomly divided into two equal groups. Saliva sample were collected before the consumption of ice-cream and Streptococcus mutans count was calculated and recorded as baseline data. For the next seven days both the groups were given ice creams marked as A and B. Saliva samples were collected after ice-cream consumption at the end of study period and also after a washout period of 30 days and again after six months. Samples were inoculated and colonies were counted. RESULTS: On statistical evaluation by students paired t-test, probiotic ice-cream brought significant reduction in the Streptococcus mutans count after seven days of ice-cream ingestion (p<0.001) and also after 30 d of washout period (p<0.001). There was no significant reduction (p=0.076) by normal ice-cream consumption. After six months of the study period in both the groups the salivary levels of Streptococcus mutans was similar to the baseline. CONCLUSION: Probiotic ice-cream containing Bifidobacterium lactis Bb-12 and Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 can cause reduction in caries causative organism. The dosage of the probiotic organisms for the long term or synergetic effect on the oral health are still needed to be explored.
TI  - Complete Genome Sequence of Lactobacillus acidophilus FSI4, Isolated from Yogurt.
AB  - A new Lactobacillus acidophilus strain, FSI4, isolated from yogurt, was isolated  and sequenced in our laboratory. Our data, although supportive of previous conclusions regarding the remarkable stability of L. acidophilus species, indicate accumulating mutations in commercial L. acidophilus strains that warrant further study of the effect of damaged genes on the competitiveness of these bacteria in gut microbiota.
TI  - Characterization of the effects of three Lactobacillus species on the function of chicken macrophages.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus salivarius can influence the adaptive immune responses in chickens but vary in their ability to do so. The present study attempted to identify how these three bacteria alter the innate immune system. A chicken macrophage cell line, MQ-NCSU, was co-cultured with the three live Lactobacillus species, alone or in combination, grown at different temperatures for various durations of time. Late exponential growth phase bacteria were more immunostimulatory, while bacterial growth temperature had little effect. L. acidophilus and L. salivarius significantly increased nitric oxide (NO) production and phagocytosis, while L. reuteri did not. In fact, L reuteri was shown to inhibit NO production of macrophages when co-cultured with the other bacteria or when cells were pre-treated with LPS. The results demonstrate a possible molecular mechanism for the immunomodulatory effects of L. acidophilus and L. salivarius, and a unique immunomodulatory ability of L. reuteri.
TI  - Effect of salt on cell viability and membrane integrity of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium longum as observed by flow cytometry.
AB  - The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of varying sodium chloride concentrations (0-5%) on viability and membrane integrity of three probiotic bacteria, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium longum, using conventional technique and flow cytometry. Double staining of cells by carboxyfluorescein diacetate (cFDA) and propidium iodide (PI) enabled to evaluate the effect of NaCl on cell esterase activity and membrane integrity. Observations from conventional culture technique were compared with findings from flow cytometric analysis on the metabolic activities of the cells and a correlation was observed between culturability and dye extrusion ability of L. casei and B. longum. However, a certain population of L. acidophilus was viable as per the plate count method but its efflux activity was compromised. Esterase activity of most bacteria reduced significantly (P < 0.05) during one week storage at NaCl concentrations greater than 3.5%. The study revealed that L. casei was least affected by higher NaCl concentrations among the three probiotic bacteria, as opposed to B. longum where the cF extrusion performance was greatly reduced during 1 wk storage. The metabolic activity and salt resistance of L. casei was found to be highest among the bacteria studied.
TI  - Murein hydrolase activity of surface layer proteins from Lactobacillus acidophilus against Escherichia coli.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the murein hydrolase activities of the surface layer proteins (SLPs) from two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus using zymography. The influence of these hydrolase activities on Escherichia coli ATCC 43893 was also evaluated by analysing their growth curve, cell morphology and physiological state. After the incubation of E. coli with SLPs, growth was inhibited, the number of viable cells was significantly reduced, examination by transmission electron microscopy showed that the cell wall was damaged and flow cytometry results indicated that the majority of the cells were sublethally injured. All of these results suggested that the SLPs of both L. acidophilus strains possessed murein hydrolase activities that were sublethal to E. coli cells.
TI  - Evaluation of the expression of I-FABP and L-FABP in a necrotizing enterocolitis  model after the use of Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a severe intestinal disease that primarily affects premature babies, leading to high mortality and morbidity. Probiotics represent an important alternative prophylaxis for NEC but its mechanism of action is poorly understood. Moreover, intestinal and liver-type fatty acid-binding proteins (I-FABP and L-FABP) may be utilized because markers of intestinal injury, including NEC. We aimed to evaluate the protection induced by the Lactobacillus acidophilus on the intestines of newborn rats submitted to experimental NEC using I-FABP and L-FABP as biomarkers. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley newborn rats were divided into three groups: (1) C (control)-breast-fed; (2) NEC-subjected to NEC protocol and (3) NECP-NEC+probiotic. Morphometric, intestinal lesion, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting analysis were performed. Statistical significant differences were considered when p<0.05. RESULTS: Intestinal weight was lower in NEC and NECP compared to C (p<0.05). Intestinal injury was lower in NECP compared to NEC. Prophylactic probiotic recovered mucosa and muscular layers' thickness to C levels (p<0.05). I-FABP and L-FABP expressions in NECP showed intermediate values between C and NEC. CONCLUSION: L. acidophilus had a protective effect on the development of NEC and FABPs could demonstrate the degree of tissular damage of the intestine.
TI  - Tackling codon usage bias for heterologous expression in Rhodobacter sphaeroides  by supplementation of rare tRNAs.
AB  - The photosynthetic Rhodobacter species are promising alternative expression hosts in bioproduction and biorefinery due to their unique metabolic capacities. With prominent inner membrane areas and efficient endogenous translocation machineries, they are especially attractive for membrane protein expression. However, codon usage bias could be a limitation in the engineering of Rhodobacter species and has seldom been investigated. In this study, we tackled the codon bias of Rhodobacter by functionally expressing 8 rare tRNAs of Rhodobacter sphaeroides with a multi-copy vector. The impact of tRNA supplementation was evaluated through monitoring expression levels of two heterologous proteins with different phylogenetic origins, a membrane subunit of the riboflavin transporter, RibU, from Lactobacillus acidophilus La-14 and a decaheme cytochrome, MtrA, from Shewanella oneidensis. Our results showed that the performances were closely related to medium composition and rare codon percentages of raw DNA sequences. Provision of rare tRNAs has increased RibU production by 7.7-folds and 2.86-fold in minimal medium and rich medium, respectively, while MtrA levels were increased by 1-fold in minimal medium. The present study confirms the presence of codon bias in R. sphaeroides and offers a facile tool for improving heterologous expression of rare-codon containing genes. We anticipate that this tRNA supplementation system can be further extended to other species of Rhodobacter, and thus will facilitate the engineering of purple bacteria for interesting applications in microbial technology.
TI  - Optimization of Anticancer Exopolysaccharide Production From Probiotic Lactobacillus Acidophilus by Response Surface Methodology.
AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in  the Western world. Recently, much attention has been focused on decreasing the risk of CRC by consuming probiotics. In the present study exopolysaccharide (EPS) extracted from Lactobacillus acidophilus was found to inhibit the growth of CaCo2 colon cancer cell line in a dose dependent manner. The experiment was performed in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions and EPS was found to reduce the survival of CaCo2 cell line in both the conditions. qPCR studies demonstrated that EPS treatment up-regulated the expression of Peroxisome Proliferator Activator Receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) in both normoxia and hypoxia conditions, whereas it up-regulated the expression of erythropoietin (EPO) in normoxic condition but there was no significant expression under hypoxic conditions. Hence, the EPS production was optimized by Plackett Burnam design followed by central composite rotatory design. The optimized production of EPS at 24 h was found to be 400 mg/L. During batch cultivation the production peaked at 21st h resulting in an EPS concentration of 597 mg/l.
TI  - Proteolytic and ACE-inhibitory activities of probiotic yogurt containing non-viable bacteria as affected by different levels of fat, inulin and starter culture.
AB  - In this study, the effects of fat (0.5 %, 3.2 % and 5.0 %), inulin (0.0 and 1.0 %) and starter culture (0.0 %, 0.5 %, 1.0 % and 1.5 %) on the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity of probiotic yogurt containing non-viable bacteria were assessed. Proteolytic activities of bacteria were also investigated. Yogurts were prepared either using a sole yogurt commercial culture including Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subs. bulgaricus or bifidobacterium animalis BB-12 and Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 in addition to yogurt culture. Relative degrees of proteolysis were found to be considerably higher in yogurt samples than UHT milk as the control. Both regular and probiotic yogurts showed considerable ACE-inhibitory activities. Results showed that degree of proteolysis was not influenced by different fat contents, while was increased by high concentration of starter culture (1.5 % w/w) and reduced by inulin (1 % w/w). ACE-inhibitory activities of yogurt were also negatively affected by the presence of inulin and high levels of fat (5 % w/w). Moreover, yogurt containing probiotic bacteria showed higher inhibitory against ACE in comparison to the yogurt prepared with non-probiotic strains.
TI  - Implications of modifying membrane fatty acid composition on membrane oxidation,  integrity, and storage viability of freeze-dried probiotic, Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of altering the fatty acid profile of the lipid membrane on storage survival of freeze-dried probiotic, Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5, as well as study the membrane integrity and lipid oxidation. The fatty acid composition of the lipid membrane of L. acidophilus La-5 was significantly different upon growth in MRS (containing Tween 80, an oleic acid source), or in MRS with Tween 20 (containing C12:0 and C14:0), linoleic, or linolenic acid supplemented. Bacteria grown in MRS showed the highest storage survival rates. No indications of loss of membrane integrity could be found, and membrane integrity could therefore not be connected with loss of viability. Survival of bacteria grown with linoleic or linolenic acid was more negatively affected by the presence of oxygen, than bacteria grown in MRS or with Tween 20 supplemented. A small, but significant, loss of linolenic acid during storage could be identified, and an increase of volatile secondary oxidation products during storage was found for bacteria grown in MRS, or with linoleic, or linolenic acid supplemented, but not for bacteria grown with Tween 20. Overall, the results indicate that lipid oxidation and loss of membrane integrity are not the only or most important detrimental reactions which can occur during storage. By altering the fatty acid composition, it was also found that properties of oleic acid gave rise to more robust bacteria than more saturated or unsaturated fatty acids did.

TI  - Physiochemical properties, microstructure, and probiotic survivability of nonfat  goats' milk yogurt using heat-treated whey protein concentrate as fat replacer.
AB  - There is a market demand for nonfat fermented goats' milk products. A nonfat goats' milk yogurt containing probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium spp.) was developed using heat-treated whey protein concentrate (HWPC) as a fat replacer and pectin as a thickening agent. Yogurts containing untreated whey protein concentrate (WPC) and pectin, and the one with only pectin were also prepared. Skim cows' milk yogurt with pectin was also made as a control. The yogurts were analyzed for chemical composition, water holding capacity (syneresis), microstructure, changes in pH and viscosity, mold, yeast and coliform counts, and probiotic survivability during storage at 4 degrees C for 10 wk. The results showed that the nonfat goats' milk yogurt made with 1.2% HWPC (WPC solution heated at 85 degrees C for 30 min at pH 8.5) and 0.35% pectin had significantly higher viscosity (P < 0.01) than any of the other yogurts and lower syneresis than the goats' yogurt with only pectin (P < 0.01). Viscosity and pH of all the yogurt samples did not change much throughout storage. Bifidobacterium spp. remained stable and was above 10(6) CFU g(-1) during the 10-wk storage. However, the population of Lactobacillus acidophilus dropped to below 10(6) CFU g(-1) after 2 wk of storage. Microstructure analysis of the nonfat goats' milk yogurt by scanning electron microscopy revealed that HWPC interacted with casein micelles to form a relatively compact network in the yogurt gel. The results indicated that HWPC could be used as a fat replacer for improving the consistency of nonfat goats' milk yogurt and other similar products.
TI  - Probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in older patients: a systematic review.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Here, we evaluated the efficacy of probiotic interventions in prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) and Clostridium difficile diarrhoea (CDD) in older patients. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and Web of Science were comprehensively searched from their dates of inception to May 2014. Only randomised controlled trials reporting data on probiotics including Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Bacillus-alone or in combination-versus placebo or absence of treatment in older patients (age >/=65 years) were included. Risk ratios (RRs) for AAD and CDD relative to placebo or absence of treatment were estimated. RESULTS: Six trials with a total of 3562 patients were included. Only one trial showed that Bacillus licheniformis was effective for preventing AAD in older patients. However, there was no preventive effect for AAD and CDD with Lactobacillus acidophilus (Florajen), Lactobacillus casei Shirota, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (boulardii) lyo, mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum (Cultech strains), and mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus CUL60, CUL21, Bifidobacterium bifidum CUL20 and B. lactis CUL34. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that probiotics may not reduce the risk of AAD and CDD in older patients. However, with current published data, it is difficult to draw concrete conclusions. To confirm these findings, sample sizes, multi-centre, double-blind studies that consider factors such as probiotic strains and types of antibiotics are required.
TI  - Perioperative synbiotics decrease postoperative complications in periampullary neoplasms: a randomized, double-blind clinical trial.
AB  - Periampullary neoplasms are rapidly progressive tumors with a poor prognosis and  high morbidity and mortality rates, which have a negative influence on patient outcomes. Some probiotics and prebiotics have the ability to protect the intestinal barrier and prevent bacterial translocation, infection, and postoperative complications. We evaluated the use of synbiotics in a prospective, double-blind study of patients undergoing surgery for periampullary neoplasms (PNs) and assessed the effect of these agents on nutritional status, postoperative complications, antibiotic use, length of hospital stay, and mortality. Patients were randomized to receive probiotics and prebiotics-synbiotics--group S [Lactobacillus acidophilus 10, 1 x 10(9)CFU, Lactobacillus rhamnosus HS 111, 1 x 10(9) CFU, Lactobacillus casei 10, 1 x 10(9) CFU, Bifidobacterium bifidum, 1 x 10(9)CFU, and fructooligosaccharides (FOS) 100 mg]--or placebo-controls--group C, twice daily, for a total of 14 days. Risk, clinical status, and postoperative complication rates were assessed. Twenty-three patients were allocated to each group. The incidence of postoperative infection was significantly lower in group S (6 of 23 patients, 26.1%) than in group C (16 of 23 patients, 69.6%) (P = 0.00). Duration of antibiotic therapy was also shorter in group S (mean = 9 days vs. 15 days in group C; P = 0.01). Noninfectious complications were less common in group S (6 of 23 vs. 14 of 23 patients in group C; P = 0.03). Mean length of hospital stay was 12 +/- 5 days in group S vs. 23 +/- 14 days in group C (P = 0.00). No deaths occurred in group S, whereas 6 deaths occurred in group C (P = 0.02). Perioperative administration of synbiotics reduces postoperative mortality and complication rates in patients undergoing surgery for PNs.
TI  - Nitrate reduction to nitrite, nitric oxide and ammonia by gut bacteria under physiological conditions.
AB  - The biological nitrogen cycle involves step-wise reduction of nitrogen oxides to  ammonium salts and oxidation of ammonia back to nitrites and nitrates by plants and bacteria. Neither process has been thought to have relevance to mammalian physiology; however in recent years the salivary bacterial reduction of nitrate to nitrite has been recognized as an important metabolic conversion in humans. Several enteric bacteria have also shown the ability of catalytic reduction of nitrate to ammonia via nitrite during dissimilatory respiration; however, the importance of this pathway in bacterial species colonizing the human intestine has been little studied. We measured nitrite, nitric oxide (NO) and ammonia formation in cultures of Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species grown at different sodium nitrate concentrations and oxygen levels. We found that the presence of 5 mM nitrate provided a growth benefit and induced both nitrite and ammonia generation in E.coli and L.plantarum bacteria grown at oxygen concentrations compatible with the content in the gastrointestinal tract. Nitrite and ammonia accumulated in the growth medium when at least 2.5 mM nitrate was present. Time-course curves suggest that nitrate is first converted to nitrite and subsequently to ammonia. Strains of L.rhamnosus, L.acidophilus and B.longum infantis grown with nitrate produced minor changes in nitrite or ammonia levels in the cultures. However, when supplied with exogenous nitrite, NO gas was readily produced independently of added nitrate. Bacterial production of lactic acid causes medium acidification that in turn generates NO by non-enzymatic nitrite reduction. In contrast, nitrite was converted to NO by E.coli cultures even at neutral pH. We suggest that the bacterial nitrate reduction to ammonia, as well as the related NO formation in the gut, could be an important aspect of the overall mammalian nitrate/nitrite/NO metabolism and is yet another way in which the microbiome links diet and health.
TI  - The use of probiotics in pediatric gastroenterology: a review of the literature and recommendations by latin-american experts.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The stability and composition of intestinal flora plays a vital role in human wellbeing throughout life from as early as birth. Over the past 50 years, several studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of probiotic administration in pediatric gastroenterology. This document aims to provide a recommendation score on probiotic utilization in pediatric gastroenterology, together with a review of current knowledge concerning its benefits, tolerability, and safety. STUDY DESIGN: Published literature was selected without study design restriction: clinical guidelines, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, outcomes research and case-controlled studies were selected using the following MESH-validated terms: probiotics, diarrhea, acute diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, traveler's diarrhea, bacterial diarrhea, nosocomial diarrhea, prophylactic diarrhea, Helicobacter pylori infection, colic, infantile colic, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), inflammatory bowel disease, constipation, and allergy. Once the validity and the quality of results were evaluated, a recommendation score and level of evidence were assigned for pediatric gastrointestinal-related conditions, according to the updated Evidence-Based Medicine guidelines: 1a for systematic review (SR) of RCTs, 1b for individual RCT, 1c for SR and individual RCT, 2a for SR of cohort studies, 2b for individual cohort studies, 2c for outcomes research, and 3a for SR of case-control studies. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The Latin American Expert group consensus recommends the use of the following probiotics for pediatric gastrointestinal conditions: prevention of acute infectious diarrhea (AID): 1b for Bifidobacterium lactis, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), and L. reuteri; prevention of nosocomial diarrhea: 1 b for B. lactis Bb12, B. bifidum, LGG and Streptococcus thermophiles; treatment of AID: 1a for LGG and S. boulardii, 1b for L. reuteri; prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea: 1b for LGG and S. boulardii; prevention of traveler's diarrhea: 1b for S. boulardii; prevention of infantile colic: 1a for L. reuteri DSM 17938; treatment of infantile colic: 1b for L. reuteri DSM 17938; prevention of NEC: 1a for B. breve, mixtures of Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus, LGG, L. acidophilus and L. reuteri DSM 17938; induction and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis: 1b for VSL#3; improving symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome: 2c for LGG and VSL#3.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents - Special references to bacteria isolated between April 2011 and March 2012].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from April 2011 to March 2012 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 785 strains including 31 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 204 (78.8%) of 259 patients with surgical infections. Five hundred and twenty three strains were isolated from primary infections, and 231 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp., in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. from surgical site infection. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from surgical site infection, E. coli was most predominantly isolated, followed by P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and E. cloacae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by Parvimonas micra, Collinsella aerofaciens, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Finegoldia magna, and from surgical site infection, E. lenta was most predominantly isolated, followed by P micra and L. acidophilus, in this order. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroidesfragilis was the highest from primary infections, followed by Bilophila wadsworthia, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides uniformis and Bacteroides vulgatus, and from surgical site infection, B. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by Bacteroides caccae, B. thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides ovatus and B. wadsworthia, in this order. In this series, vancomycin-resistant MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa were not observed. We should carefully follow up B. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antimicrobial agents, and also Bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactams.
TI  - Different bacterial models for in vitro induction of non-cavitated enamel caries-like lesions: Microhardness and polarized light miscroscopy analyses.
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare different bacterial models for in vitro induction of non-cavitated enamel caries-like lesions by microhardness and polarized light microscopy analyses. One hundred blocks of bovine enamel were randomly divided into four groups (n = 25) according to the bacterial model for caries induction: (A) Streptococcus mutans, (B) S. mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus, (C) S. mutans and L. casei, and (D) S. mutans, L. acidophilus, and L. casei. Within each group, the blocks were randomly divided into five subgroups according to the duration of the period of caries induction (4-20 days). The enamel blocks were immersed in cariogenic solution containing the microorganisms, which was changed every 48 h. Groups C and D presented lower surface hardness values (SMH) and higher area of hardness loss (DeltaS) after the cariogenic challenge than groups A and B (P < 0.05). As regards lesion depth, under polarized light microscopy, group A presented significantly lower values, and groups C and D the highest values. Group B showed a higher value than group A (P < 0.05). Groups A and B exhibited subsurface caries lesions after all treatment durations, while groups C and D presented erosion-type lesions with surface softening. The model using S. mutans, whether or not it was associated with L. acidophilus, was less aggressive and may be used for the induction of non-cavitated enamel caries-like lesions. The optimal period for inducing caries-like lesions was 8 days. Microsc. Res. Tech. 78:444-451, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
TI  - Does Maternal Perinatal Probiotic Supplementation Alter the Intestinal Microbiota of Mother and Child? A Randomized Controlled Trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Maternal probiotic supplementation has been shown to prevent the development of atopic dermatitis (AD) in their offspring. We aimed to investigate whether probiotics in pregnant and breastfeeding mothers altered the colonization pattern and the diversity of the mothers' and children's intestinal microbiota. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind trial, women received probiotic milk or placebo from 36 weeks of gestation until 3 months postnatally whilst breastfeeding. The probiotic milk contained Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), L. acidophilus La-5 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bb-12. Stool samples were collected from the mothers at 30 to 36 weeks gestation and 3 months after birth, and from the child at age 10 days, 3 months, 1 year and 2 years, and bacteria were analysed by quantitative PCR. Additionally, stool samples from 3 months old and 2 years old children were characterized using 16S rRNA gene deep sequencing to estimate the bacterial classes and genera, and the alpha and beta diversity. RESULTS: Three months after birth, both the prevalence and the relative abundance of the administered probiotic bacteria were significantly increased among the mothers in the probiotic group compared to the placebo group. Only the LGG bacteria colonized the children at 10 days and at 3 months of age. There were no significant differences in the abundance of the administered probiotic bacteria between the groups at 1 and 2 years of age. For the bacterial classes and genera, and alpha and beta diversity there were no significant differences between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Different probiotic bacteria seem to have different ability to transfer from the mother to the child. We found no evidence that the probiotics altered the microbial composition or alpha and beta diversity of the children.
TI  - Reduced Burden of Salmonella enterica in Bovine Subiliac Lymph Nodes Associated with Administration of a Direct-fed Microbial.
AB  - Despite effective food safety interventions within abattoirs, Salmonella enterica remains a common contaminant of raw ground beef. Research has recently implicated peripheral lymph nodes (PLNs) as a potential route by which Salmonella contaminates ground beef. This study examined the efficacy of using Lactobacillus animalis (formerly designated Lactobacillus acidophilus; NP51) and Propionibacterium freudenreichii (NP24), at 109 cfu/head/day, as a direct-fed microbial (DFM) in feedlot cattle diets to control Salmonella within PLNs. Two studies were conducted in which cattle were randomly allocated into either control or DFM treatment groups. Diets of treated cattle were supplemented with 109 cfu/head/day of the DFM, while control groups received no DFM supplementation. During slaughter at abattoirs, one subiliac lymph node (SLN) per carcass was collected from 627 carcasses from one study and 99 carcasses from the second study. Lymph nodes were cultured to estimate the presence and concentration of Salmonella. In the first study, effects of DFM supplementation varied across slaughter days. On the first and second slaughter days, prevalence was reduced by 50% (P = 0.0072) and 31% (P = 0.0093), respectively. No significant difference was observed on slaughter day three (P = 0.1766). In the second study, Salmonella was 82% less likely (P = 0.008) to be recovered from SLNs of treatment cattle. While a greater relative risk reduction was observed in the latter study, absolute risk reductions were similar across studies. A significant reduction in the concentration of Salmonella in SLNs (P < 0.0001) on a cfu/g and cfu/node basis was also observed in cattle administered NP51 and NP24 in the first study; in the second study, too few quantifiable SLNs were observed to facilitate meaningful comparisons. The results indicate that NP51 and NP24 supplementation may aid in reducing the prevalence and concentration of Salmonella in SLNs and, therefore, serve as an effective control measure to reduce Salmonella in ground beef products.
TI  - Candidiasis (vulvovaginal).
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vulvovaginal candidiasis is estimated to be the second most common  cause of vaginitis after bacterial vaginosis. Candida albicans accounts for 85% to 90% of cases. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of drug treatments for acute vulvovaginal candidiasis in non-pregnant symptomatic women? What are the effects of alternative or complementary treatments for acute vulvovaginal candidiasis in non-pregnant symptomatic women? What are the effects of treating asymptomatic non-pregnant women with a positive swab for candidiasis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 23 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: alternative or complementary treatments; douching; drug treatments; garlic; intravaginal preparations (nystatin, imidazoles, tea tree oil); oral fluconazole; oral itraconazole; and yoghurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus (oral or intravaginal).
TI  - Improved viability of Lactobacillus acidophilus NRRL-B 4495 during freeze-drying  in whey protein-pullulan microcapsules.
AB  - In this research, pullulan was incorporated in protein-based encapsulation matrix in order to assess its cryoprotective effect on the viability of freeze-dried (FD) probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus NRRL-B 4495. This study demonstrated that pullulan in encapsulation matrix resulted in a 90.4% survival rate as compared to 88.1% for whey protein (WPI) encapsulated cells. The protective effects of pullulan on the survival of FD-encapsulated cells in gastrointestinal conditions were compared. FD WPI-pullulan capsules retained higher survived cell numbers (7.10 log CFU/g) than those of FD WPI capsules (6.03 log CFU/g) after simulated gastric juice exposure. Additionally, use of pullulan resulted in an increased viability after bile exposure. FD-free bacteria exhibited 2.18 log CFU/g reduction, while FD WPI and FD WPI-pullulan encapsulated bacteria showed 0.95 and 0.49 log CFU/g reduction after 24 h exposure to bile solution, respectively. Morphology of the FD microcapsules was visualized by scanning electron microscopy.
TI  - Effects of probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei on colorectal tumor cells activity (CaCo-2).
AB  - BACKGROUND: The probiotic microorganisms are live normal flora that provide nutritional benefits. When probiotic administered in adequate amounts, they also confer a health benefit on the host. Different mechanisms of probiotic effects include the following: stimulating the immune system, modifying the composition of normal intestinal flora and preventing the carcinogenic activity of fecal enzymes. In this study, direct effects of probiotic lactobacilli on tumor cells were investigated. METHODS: Supernatants and bacterial extracts of two standard Lactobacillus species (L. acidophilus and L. casei) were prepared and CaCo-2 cells were treated with them. Probiotic effects on cell proliferation, necrosis, apoptosis, migration and invasion were assessed. RESULTS: The supernatants of Lactobacilli decreased cell proliferation and increased cell apoptosis, however, no significant effect on cell necrosis was reported. In contrast, Lactobacilli extract, reduced cell proliferation and increased cell apoptosis. Lactobacilli extract also led to cell necrosis. Furthermore, both supernatants and cell extracts of the probiotic agents resulted in decreased cells' migration and invasion. CONCLUSION: In this study, it was shown that Lactobacilli probiotics useful effects are not confined to the enhancement of the immune system; however, they effectively suppress the malignant phenotypes of colorectal cancer cells.
TI  - Development of novel formulations containing Lysozyme and Lactoferrin and evaluation of antibacterial effects on Mutans Streptococci and Lactobacilli.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the antibacterial effect of different formulations containing Lysozyme and Lactoferrin and drug delivery system as well as poloxamer 407 with the trade name of Pluronic F-127 and/or freeze dried liposome containing DOTAP [freeze dried Liposomal DOTAP] on Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus in comparison with 0.2% chlorhexidine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antibacterial effect was assessed by determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for the study and control groups on Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus. The amounts of biofilm formation accumulation of Mutans Streptococci for 24h on sterile hydroxyapatite discs after application of different formulations were evaluated. The different formulations studied were: (1) Sorensen's Buffer Solution, (2) a gel formulation containing only poloxamer 407, (3) Lysozyme and Lactoferrin dissolved in Sorensen's Buffer Solution, (4) poloxamer 407 combined with the third formulation, (5) Freeze dried Liposomal DOTAP dissolved in Sorensen's Buffer Solution, (6) Freeze dried Liposomal DOTAP combined with poloxamer 407 dispersed in Sorensen's Buffer Solution, (7) Freeze dried Liposomal DOTAP combined with the third formulation, and (8) Lysozyme and Lactoferrin dissolved in Sorensen's Buffer Solution, which was then incorporated into poloxamer 407 and combined with Freeze dried Liposomal DOTAP. The positive and negative control groups were 0.2% chlorhexidine gel and empty hydroxyapatite discs, respectively. Statistical evaluation was carried out with Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's multiple comparison tests. RESULTS: It was observed that the first, third and fifth groups did not have any antibacterial effects on the tested bacteria. The groups that contained poloxamer 407 had nearly identical antibacterial effects on Mutans Streptococci and L. acidophilus. These formulations also inhibited biofilm formation of the bacteria (p<0.05) more effectively. In the positive control group, there was no biofilm formation. CONCLUSIONS: Among the formulations containing poloxamer 407, the one containing Lysozyme and Lactoferrin exhibited the highest inhibitory effect on the tested bacteria. This novel formulation can be beneficial as an antibacterial agent for the prevention of dental caries and biofilm formation.
TI  - Vaginal Lactobacillus gasseri CMUL57 can inhibit herpes simplex type 2 but not Coxsackievirus B4E2.
AB  - This study aimed at demonstrating the antiviral activity of Lactobacillus gasseri CMUL57 (L. gasseri CMUL57), L. acidophilus CMUL67 and L. plantarum CMUL140 against herpes simplex type 2 (HSV-2) and Coxsackievirus B4E2 (CVB4E2), which are enveloped and naked viruses, respectively. These lactobacilli were non-cytotoxic and were able to reduce the cytopathic effect induced by HSV-2 in Vero cell monolayers. However, lactobacilli were not active against CVB4E2. Tested lactobacilli displayed anti-HSV-2 activity when they were co-incubated with the virus prior to inoculating the mixture to Vero cell monolayers. The detection of HSV-2 DNA by PCR in pellets of bacteria/virus mixtures let us to hypothesize that anti-HSV-2 activity of lactobacilli resulted from the viruses' entrapment. This study showed the capabilities of vaginal lactobacilli to inhibit enveloped viruses such as HSV-2.
TI  - The effects of probiotics on treatment of Helicobacter pylori eradication in children.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the eradication rates and side effects of probiotics added in standard triple therapy for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). METHODS: A prospective open study was performed in the outpatient clinics of the Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, School of Medicine, Suleyman Demirel University, Isparta, Turkey between March 2012 and May 2013. Sixty-one symptomatic children (range 7-18 years) with H. pylori infection were randomized to 2 groups: group 1 received standard triple therapy (lansoprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin for 14 days), group 2 received the standard triple therapy plus probiotics (Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium lactis). Side effects of the drugs were recorded. The 14C-urea breath test was performed for 6 weeks after discontinuation of the therapy. RESULTS: Helicobacter pylori infection was detected in 61 of 95 (64.2%) children. Fifty-six patients (38 girls and 18 boys) completed the study. Their mean age was 13.9 +/- 2.7 years. Helicobacter pylori eradication rate was 68.9% in group 1, and 66.6% in group 2 (p=0.78). No statistically significant difference was observed between the 2 groups in terms of side effects. CONCLUSION: We found no evidence in terms of eradication of H. pylori, or impact on adverse effects obtained after the addition of probiotics to standard treatment. Larger randomized controlled investigations are needed to clearly understand the effects of probiotics on H. pylori eradication.
TI  - SIGNing a symbiotic treaty with gut microbiota.
AB  - Beneficial microbes hold great promise for the treatment of a wide range of immune and inflammatory disorders. In this issue of The EMBO Journal, Lightfoot and colleagues report how the food-grade bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus helps the immune system to limit experimental colitis in mice through interaction between SIGNR3 and surface layer protein A (SlpA) in L. acidophilus. These results pave the way for future development of novel therapies for inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease.
TI  - Determining the role of a probiotic in the restoration of intestinal microbial balance by molecular and cultural techniques.
AB  - The human intestine has a vast variety of microorganisms, and their balance is dependent on several factors. Antibiotics affect microfloral balance and allow naturally opportunistic organisms to multiply. Azithromycin is the most widely used macrolide antibiotic, active against a wide number of pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. It is currently used in the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients. The use of probiotics has advantages in gastrointestinal conditions, including infectious diarrhea and imbalance due to antibiotic use. In this research, the effect of azithromycin on the intestinal microbiota of Sprague Dawley rats and the role of Lactobacillus acidophilus in the restoration of the balance by employing molecular and cultural techniques was investigated. PCR with universal primers targeting the V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene followed by DGGE was used to characterize the overall intestinal microbiota composition. Cultivable fecal bacteria count using microbiological media and semi-quantitative PCR with group-specific primers were also utilized to analyze the effects of antibiotic and probiotic on microflora. We found that the total amount of 16S rRNA gene and fecal aerobic bacterial count was reduced following azithromycin administration along with elimination of non-pathogenic Escherichia coli, but it was restored by the use of the probiotic. The results from PCR with group-specific primers showed that Bacteroides sp was present in the control and probiotic groups, but it was nearly eliminated in the antibiotic group. Moreover, semi-quantitative PCR revealed that the numbers of Enterobacteriaceae were nearly the same in the probiotic group and decreased in the antibiotic group, while Bifidobacterium was significantly increased in the probiotic group and decreased in the antibiotic group (P < 0.05) as compared with that in the control group. Azithromycin-induced dysbiosis can result in prolonged deleterious effects on the host. The present study revealed that the use of lactic acid bacteria particularly L. acidophilus helped to restore intestinal microfloral balance.
TI  - Cocktails of probiotics pre-adapted to multiple stress factors are more robust under simulated gastrointestinal conditions than their parental counterparts and exhibit enhanced antagonistic capabilities against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The success of the probiotics in delivery of health benefits depends  on their ability to withstand the technological and gastrointestinal conditions; hence development of robust cultures is critical to the probiotic industry. Combinations of probiotic cultures have proven to be more effective than the use of single cultures for treatment and prevention of heterogeneous diseases. We investigated the effect of pre- adaptation of probiotics to multiple stresses on their stability under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and the effect of their singular as well as their synergistic antagonistic effect against selected enteric pathogens. METHODS: Probiotic cultures were inoculated into MRS broth adjusted to pH 2 and incubated for 2 h at 37 degrees C. Survivors of pH 2 were subcultured into 2% bile acid for 1 h at 37 degrees C. Cells that showed growth after exposure to 2% bile acid for 1 h were finally inoculated in fresh MRS broth and incubated at 55 degrees C for 2 h. The cells surviving were then used as stress adapted cultures. The adapted cultures were exposed to simulated gastrointestinal conditions and their non- adapted counterparts were used to compare the effects of stress adaptation. The combination cultures were tested for their antipathogenic effects on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. RESULTS: Acid and bile tolerances of most of the stress-adapted cells were higher than of the non-adapted cells. Viable counts of all the stress-adapted lactobacilli and Bifidobacterium longum LMG 13197 were higher after sequential exposure to simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. However, for B. longum Bb46 and B. bifidum LMG 13197, viability of non-adapted cells was higher than for adapted cells after exposure to these fluids. A cocktail containing L. plantarum + B. longum Bb46 + B. longum LMG 13197 best inhibited S. aureus while E. coli was best inhibited by a combination containing L. acidophilus La14 150B + B. longum Bb46 + B. bifidum LMG 11041. A cocktail containing the six non- adapted cultures was the least effective in inhibiting the pathogens. CONCLUSION: Multi-stress pre-adaptation enhances viability of probiotics under simulated gastrointestinal conditions; and formulations containing a mixture of multi stress-adapted cells exhibits enhanced synergistic effects against foodborne pathogens.
TI  - iTRAQ proteomic analysis of N-acetylmuramic acid mediated anti-inflammatory capacity in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus probiotic bacteria have lasting beneficial health effects in the gastrointestinal tract, including protecting against pathogens, improving immunomodulation, and producing beneficial bacteria-derived molecules. In lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced RAW 264.7 cells treated with peptidoglycan or N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) from L. acidophilus, 390 differentially expressed proteins (8.76%) were identified by iTRAQ analysis, 257 (5.77%) of which were upregulated and 133 (2.99%) were downregulated under LPS-induced conditions. Most of these proteins were grouped into the following inflammation-related cellular signaling: lysosome pathway, calcium signaling pathway, and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway. Among them, clathrin, SERCA, and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist were differentially expressed to a significant degree in peptidoglycan or NAM pretreated RAW 264.7 cells. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that NAM may mediate an anti-inflammatory process via a Ca2+ -dependent NF-kappaB pathway. These observations reveal new insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in the suppression of LPS-induced macrophage inflammation by L. acidophilus.
TI  - [Biological effect of extracellular peptide factor from Lateococcus japonicas subsp. casei on probiotic bacteria].
AB  - The biological effect of the extracellular peptide reactivating factor (RF) from  Luteococcus casei on cells of probiotic cultures was studied. The RF showed the protective and reactivating effects on the Bifidobacterium bifidum cells under the action of bile salts and an acidic stress. Also, it acted as a cryoprotector during lyophilisation and long-term culture storage. The RF and the L. casei culture liquid (CL) were shown to have bifidogenic properties. The degree of protection and reactivation of lactic-acid bacteria under the action of bile salts depended on the particular strain properties. The maximum degree of protection (more than thirteen-fold) and reactivation (close to three-fold) was found in Lactobacillus casei, while the minimum values were characteristic of Lactobacillus reuterii. The resistance of lactobacilli to bile was increased in the row of L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus, and L. reuterii correlating with the RF protection degree.
TI  - Probiotics (Lactobacillus rhamnosus R0011 and acidophilus R0052) reduce the expression of toll-like receptor 4 in mice with alcoholic liver disease.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The role of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4)  in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) has been widely established. We evaluated the biological effects of probiotics (Lactobacillus rhamnosus R0011 and acidophilus R0052), KRG (Korea red ginseng), and urushiol (Rhus verniciflua Stokes) on ALD, including their effects on normal and high-fat diet in mice. METHODS: One hundred C57BL/6 mice were classified into normal (N) and high-fat diet (H) groups. Each group was divided into 5 sub-groups: control, alcohol, alcohol+probiotics, alcohol+KRG, and alcohol+urushiol. A liver function test, histology, electron-microscopy, interleukin (IL)-1beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-6, and IL-10, and TLR 4 were evaluated and compared. RESULTS: In the N group, probiotics, KRG, and urushiol significantly reduced levels of TNF-alpha (12.3+/-5.1, 13.4+/-3.9, and 12.1+/-4.3 vs. 27.9+/-15.2 pg/mL) and IL-1beta (108.4+/-39.4, 75.0+/-51.0, and 101.1+/-26.8 vs. 162.4+/-37.5 pg/mL), which were increased by alcohol. Alcohol-induced TLR 4 expression was reduced by probiotics and urushiol (0.7+/-0.2, and 0.8+/-0.1 vs. 1.0+/-0.3, p<0.001). In the H group, IL-10 was significantly increased by probiotics and KRG, compared with alcohol (25.3+/-15.6 and 20.4+/-6.2 vs. 7.6+/-5.6 pg/mL) and TLR 4 expression was reduced by probiotics (0.8+/-0.2 vs. 1.0+/-0.3, p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol-induced TLR 4 expression was down-regulated by probiotics in the normal and high-fat diet groups. Probiotics, KRG, and urushiol might be effective in the treatment of ALD by regulating the gut-liver axis.
TI  - Solution structure of acidocin B, a circular bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus M46.
AB  - Acidocin B, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus M46, was originally reported to be a linear peptide composed of 59 amino acid residues. However, its high sequence similarity to gassericin A, a circular bacteriocin from Lactobacillus gasseri LA39, suggested that acidocin B might be circular as well. Acidocin B was purified from culture supernatant by a series of hydrophobic interaction chromatographic steps. Its circular nature was ascertained by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) sequencing. The peptide sequence was found to consist of 58 amino acids with a molecular mass of 5,621.5 Da. The sequence of the acidocin B biosynthetic gene cluster was also determined and showed high nucleotide sequence similarity to that of gassericin A. The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) solution structure of acidocin B in sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles was elucidated, revealing that it is composed of four alpha-helices of similar length that are folded to form a compact, globular bundle with a central pore. This is a three-dimensional structure for a member of subgroup II circular bacteriocins, which are classified based on their isoelectric points of approximately 7 or lower. Comparison of acidocin B with carnocyclin A, a subgroup I circular bacteriocin with four alpha-helices and a pI of 10, revealed differences in the overall folding. The observed variations could be attributed to inherent diversity in their physical properties, which also required the use of different solvent systems for three-dimensional structural elucidation.
TI  - Effect of probiotics on the expression of Barrett's oesophagus biomarkers.
AB  - Barrett's oesophagus (BO) is a complicated condition at the gastroesophageal junction in which normal squamous epithelium is changed to columnar and leads to oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OA). In the past decades, the prevalence of Barrett's disease and mortality rate of adenocarcinoma has significantly increased throughout the word. Data has shown that molecular pathogenesis of disease has not been clearly identified. However, a wide-range and successful administration of probiotics in cancer and gastrointestinal diseases has lead to the investigation into the possible inhibitory role of probiotics in oesophageal cancer. This study was conducted to evaluate the inhibitory effect of probiotics on the expression of biomarkers in an in vitro model. Two different Barrett's oesophageal cell lines were selected to co-culture with B. longum and Lactobacillus acidophilus to measure expression of IL-18, TNFalpha, p53 (tumour suppressor gene), cyclooxygenase 2 and CDX1 (caudal type homeobox 1) genes. In addition, two different aspects of probiotic administration, therapeutic and prophylactic test were also examined. Results showed that micro-organisms could inhibit expression of biomarkers and therapeutic culture conditions were more effective than prophylactic tests. The results obtained suggest that it is possible to incorporate the administration of probiotics in BO and OA prevention.
TI  - SIGNR3-dependent immune regulation by Lactobacillus acidophilus surface layer protein A in colitis.
AB  - Intestinal immune regulatory signals govern gut homeostasis. Breakdown of such regulatory mechanisms may result in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Lactobacillus acidophilus contains unique surface layer proteins (Slps), including SlpA, SlpB, SlpX, and lipoteichoic acid (LTA), which interact with pattern recognition receptors to mobilize immune responses. Here, to elucidate the role of SlpA in protective immune regulation, the NCK2187 strain, which solely expresses SlpA, was generated. NCK2187 and its purified SlpA bind to the C-type lectin SIGNR3 to exert regulatory signals that result in mitigation of colitis, maintenance of healthy gastrointestinal microbiota, and protected gut mucosal barrier function. However, such protection was not observed in Signr3(-/-) mice, suggesting that the SlpA/SIGNR3 interaction plays a key regulatory role in colitis. Our work presents critical insights into SlpA/SIGNR3-induced responses that are integral to the potential development of novel biological therapies for autoinflammatory diseases, including IBD.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of synthetic antimicrobial decapeptide against oral bacteria].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide, a novel antimicrobial peptide, against several major cariogenic and periodontopathogenic bacteria in vitro. METHODS In this study, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide against Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans), Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus gordonii, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Saccharomyces albicans in vitro using the agar diffusion method and broth dilution method. Furthermore, a time-kill kinetic study of decapeptide against S. mutans was performed. RESULTS: The results showed that decapeptide exhibited antimicrobial activity against various oral bacteria and fungi. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of main cariogenic bacteria ranged from 62.5 mug . mL(-1) to 125 mug . mL(-1), and the MIC of periodontopathogenic bacteria tested ranged from 250 mug . mL(-1) to 1,000 mug . mL(-1). Among the bacteria tested, decapeptide had a strong inhibitory effect on cariogenic S. mutans. Results of the time-kill kinetic studies showed that decapeptide reduced the viable counts of S. mutans by more than one order of magnitude after 20 min of incubation, and thoroughly killed S. mutans after 30 min. No viable cells could be detected after 24 h of incubation. CONCLUSION: This study suggest that decapeptide might have potential clinical application in treating dental caries by killing S. mutans within dental plaque.
TI  - Effects of oral administration of Lactobacillus acidophilus L-92 on the symptoms  and serum cytokines of atopic dermatitis in Japanese adults: a double-blind, randomized, clinical trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Several studies on lactobacilli have demonstrated they are effective  against atopic dermatitis (AD) in children, but there are very few reports of their effects in adults. We investigated the changes in AD symptoms in adults after the ingestion of the Lactobacillus acidophilus strain L-92 (L-92), which has been shown to have a curative effect on AD in children. METHODS: A double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled comparison was performed on 49 AD patients aged >/=16 years using heat-killed L-92. Skin lesions were assessed using the SCORing AD (SCORAD) index before the start of L-92 ingestion and 4 and 8 weeks after ingestion. Serum cytokine and blood marker levels were measured 8 weeks after the start of L-92 ingestion. RESULTS: The group that ingested L-92 had lower SCORAD scores than the controls (p = 0.002). The L-92 group also had decreased ratios of change for eosinophil count (p = 0.03) and increased ratios of change for serum TGF-beta (p = 0.03). Ratios of change for serum TGF-beta rose significantly (p = 0.04) in patients showing mitigated symptoms with L-92 administration. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of heat-killed L-92 was effective for AD symptoms in adults. L-92 may contribute to the suppression of Th2-dominant inflammation. Our preliminary trial is the first to report the effects of L-92 on adult AD.
TI  - The effects of probiotics and prebiotics on the fatty acid profile and conjugated linoleic acid content of fermented cow milk.
AB  - The ability of probiotic bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 and Bifidobacterium animalis Bb12), to produce conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) in association with Streptococcus thermophilus and Lb. bulgaricus during milk fermentation has been evaluated in this study. Pasteurized cow milk and infant formula were used. Infant formula was selected for its high linoleic acid content, for being a source of CLA and for its prebiotic compounds, e.g. galacto-oligosaccharides. The microorganisms were not able to increase the CLA content of the fermented products under the given experimental conditions. No statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) occurred between the CLA content in milk and the fermented samples. The CLA contents of 10 commercial fermented milk products were determined. The highest CLA content was observed in fermented milk containing only Str. thermophilus and Lb. bulgaricus.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 inhibits biofilm formation by C. albicans and attenuates the experimental candidiasis in Galleria mellonella.
AB  - Probiotic strains of Lactobacillus have been studied for their inhibitory effects on Candida albicans. However, few studies have investigated the effect of these strains on biofilm formation, filamentation and C. albicans infection. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 on C. albicans ATCC 18804 using in vitro and in vivo models. In vitro analysis evaluated the effects of L. acidophilus on the biofilm formation and on the capacity of C. albicans filamentation. For in vivo study, Galleria mellonella was used as an infection model to evaluate the effects of L. acidophilus on candidiasis by survival analysis, quantification of C. albicans CFU/mL, and histological analysis. The direct effects of L. acidophilus cells on C. albicans, as well as the indirect effects using only a Lactobacillus culture filtrate, were evaluated in both tests. The in vitro results showed that both L. acidophilus cells and filtrate were able to inhibit C. albicans biofilm formation and filamentation. In the in vivo study, injection of L. acidophilus into G. mellonella larvae infected with C. albicans increased the survival of these animals. Furthermore, the number of C. albicans CFU/mL recovered from the larval hemolymph was lower in the group inoculated with L. acidophilus compared to the control group. In conclusion, L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 inhibited in vitro biofilm formation by C. albicans and protected G. mellonella against experimental candidiasis in vivo.
TI  - Plant extract enhances the viability of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Lactobacillus acidophilus in probiotic nonfat yogurt.
AB  - A commercial plant extract (prepared from olive, garlic, onion and citrus extracts with sodium acetate (SA) as a carrier) was evaluated to extend the viability of yogurt starter and probiotic bacteria as a means to enhance the shelf life of live and active culture, probiotic nonfat yogurt. Yogurts prepared from three different formulas (0.5* plant extract, 0.25* SA, or no supplement) and cultures (yogurt starter plus Bifidobacterium animalis,Lactobacillus acidophilus, or both probiotics) were assessed weekly during 29 days of storage at 5 degrees C. Supplemented yogurt mixes had greater buffering capacities than non-supplemented yogurt mixes. At the end of storage, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and L. acidophilus counts in supplemented yogurts were greater compared with non-supplemented yogurts. Supplementation did not affect Streptococcus thermophilus and B. animalis counts. Hence the greater buffering capacity of yogurt containing plant extract could enhance the longevity of the probiotics, L. bulgaricus and L. acidophilus, during storage.
TI  - Determination of microbiological and chemical properties of probiotic boza and its consumer acceptability.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of research was producing boza as a probiotic product with certificated probiotic starter cultures (Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 and Bifidobacterium bifidum BB-12 and Saccharomyces boulardii). METHODS: Analysis were done in boza samples taken in fermentation and storage. Probiotic and non-probiotic bacteria were enumerated with pour plate technique and yeast enumerated spread plate technique. Sugar, organic acid and Water soluble vitamin content were determined by using of HPLC. Sensory analyses were done by two different types of panels, once comprised of trained panelists and the other of consumers. Shelf life was determined according the results of sensory analysis. RESULTS: It was determinated that S. boulardii and L acidophilius counts increased nearly 0.5 log unit during of boza fermentation. Lactic, acetic, citric, butyric and succinic acid as organic acids and thiamin, niacin, B6 and pantothenic acid as water soluble vitamin evaluated in boza samples. Shelf life of the probiotic boza determined as 12 days at +4 degrees C fridge storage temperature. CONCLUSION: The boza samples had a probiotic effect because it had viable microorganisms more than 10(6) cfu/ml which was defined enough for functional foods. All boza samples had lower pH value than 4.5, so it is evaluated that boza is a safety food as its low pH preventing pathogen growth.
TI  - A gastro-resistant ovalbumin bi-layered mini-tablet-in-tablet system for the delivery of Lactobacillus acidophilus probiotic to simulated human intestinal and colon conditions.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The viability of probiotic bacteria during formulation processes and  delivery is vital to ensure health benefits. This study focuses on the use of gastro-resistant denatured ovalbumin for the targeted delivery of probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus to simulated human intestinal and colon conditions through a bi-layered mini-tablet-in-tablet system (BMTTS). METHODS: The BMTTS consists of two gastro-resistant ovalbumin mini-tablets containing L. acidophilus suspended in lactose and eudragit S100 for targeted intestinal and colonic delivery respectively. Luminescence has been utilized to ensure probiotic viability during formulation processes in addition to determining all probiotic release profiles. The mechanism of probiotic release from the ovalbumin matrix was ascertained using mathematical modelling and molecular docking studies. Magnetic resonance imaging and differential scanning calorimetry are also included as part of the in-vitro characterization of the ovalbumin system. KEY FINDINGS: The BMTTS was effective in the delivery of L. acidophilus to simulated human intestinal and colon conditions. Formulation processes were furthermore determined to maintain probiotic viability. Statistical analysis of the release data noted a significant effect of pH denaturation on the release properties of ovalbumin. Magnetic resonance imaging results have indicated a decrease in ovalbumin matrix size upon exposure to simulated intestinal fluid. Molecular docking studies carried out depicted the interaction and binding positions inherent to the ovalbumin-pancreatic trypsin interaction complex indicating the possible enzymatic degradation of ovalbumin leading to the release of the probiotic from the protein matrix. CONCLUSIONS: The BMTTS has been determined to be effective in the protection and delivery of probiotic L. acidophilus to simulated human intestinal and colonic conditions. Molecular docking analysis has noted that pancreatin exerts a significant effect on probiotic release from the gastro-resistant ovalbumin matrix.
TI  - Preparation and application characteristics of microencapsulated Lactobacillus acidophilus as probiotics for dogs.
AB  - In this article, preparation and application characteristics of microencapsulated Lactobacillus acidophilus were investigated. Results indicated that the optimum condition for preparation of micro encapsulation were 10% (w/v) wall material and the temperature of 20 degrees C, respectively. Many micropores in the porous starch micro particles was also observed by Scanning Electron Microscope. Furthermore, the released cell counts were increase from 2.43 log cfu/g to 9.17 log cfu/g for the time prolong to 3h in the simulated colonic pH solution. On the other hand, the visible cells of Lactobacillus acidophilus in the dog feces on the 10th day after the probiotics feeding was improve about 34.8% compare to the before feeding, which was decrease about 24.6%for Escherichia coli. Furthermore, the content of is ovaleric acid, indole and 3-methylindole, putrefactive substances in dog feces, before feeding were reduce 24%, 16% and 45% in dog feces on the 10th day after feeding compared to that before feeding, respectively. Micro encapsulation can be considered a useful technology to provide the protection for Lactobacillus acidophilus and better application effective.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of different lactobacilli on Candida albicans hyphal formation and biofilm development.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different species of Lactobacilli on hyphal formation and biofilm development by the opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans. We employed 4 different Lactobacillus species, namely L. rhamnosus, L. acidophilus, L. plantarum and L. reuteri, and 2 C. albicans strains, the reference DAY286 and its isogenic hwp1/hwp1 mutant, the FJS24 strain. As assessed by morphological analysis and quantitative colorimetric assays, Lactobacillus crude filtrate supernatant fluids (CFSF) affected Candida, impairing both hyphal formation and biofilm production. The CFSF-mediated phenomenon occurred in a dilution- and time-dependent manner and was consistently observed, irrespective of the C. albicans HWP1 genotype.
TI  - Pre-treatment with probiotics prolongs survival after experimental infection by multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in rodents: an effect on sepsis-induced immunosuppression.
AB  - Based on several randomised clinical studies indicating benefit from oral probiotic intake for the prevention of hospital-acquired infections in critically ill patients, this study aimed to explain the mechanism of action of probiotics for the prevention of lethal experimental infection by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Experiments using an Escherichia coli strain susceptible to all antimicrobials were also conducted. C57BL/6 mice were pre-treated intraperitoneally with sterile water for injection or Lactobacillus plantarum. Survival was recorded and mice were sacrificed for measurement of apoptosis and tissue bacterial overgrowth and for isolation and culture of splenocytes for cytokine production. Experiments were repeated after pre-treatment with a commercial preparation of four probiotics (L. plantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Saccharomyces boulardii and Bifidobacterium lactis; LactoLevure((R))). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy volunteers were stimulated by heat-killed P. aeruginosa following pre-treatment with medium or probiotics. Pre-treatment with L. plantarum significantly prolonged survival after challenge by either MDR P. aeruginosa (66.7% vs. 31.3%; P=0.026) or E. coli (56.0% vs. 12.0%, P=0.003). Survival benefit was even more pronounced when mice were pre-treated with LactoLevure((R)). Tissue bacterial outgrowth and apoptosis of white blood cells and splenocytes were not altered. TNFalpha and IL-10 production by splenocytes of mice pre-treated with probiotic was increased and IFNgamma production was decreased. Pre-treatment with LactoLevure((R)) restored production of IL-17. Stimulation of human PBMCs after probiotic pre-treatment was accompanied by reduced gene expression of SOCS3. The results suggest that the protective effect of probiotics is mediated through prevention of sepsis-induced immunosuppression.
TI  - Draft Genome Sequence of the Probiotic Strain Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356.
AB  - We present the 1,956,699-bp draft genome sequence of Lactobacillus acidophilus strain ATCC 4356. Comparative genomic analysis revealed 99.96% similarity with L. acidophilus NCFM NC_006814.3 and 99.97% with La-14 NC_021181.2 genomes.
TI  - Bioactivity of water soluble extracts and some characteristics of white cheese during the ripening period as effected by packaging type and probiotic adjunct cultures.
AB  - In this study, the chemical composition, proteolysis and in vitro angiotensin-converting enzyme-(ACE)-inhibitory and antioxidant activities of white cheeses made using probiotic adjunct cultures (Bifidobacterium bifidum DSMZ 20456 and Lactobacillus acidophilus DSMZ 20079) were investigated. The cheeses were ripened in a vacuum package or brine for 120 d at 4 degrees C. The cheese samples maintained the probiotic characteristics of the viable cells as >106 cfu/g even after ripening for 120 d. The proteolysis degrees in terms of water-soluble nitrogen/total nitrogen (WSN/TN), trichloroacetic acid-soluble nitrogen/total nitrogen (TCA-SN/TN) and phosphotungstic acid-soluble nitrogen/total nitrogen (PTA-SN/TN) values in the cheeses increased throughout the ripening. The highest levels of proteolysis were found in cheese made using Lb. acidophilus DSMZ 20079 and ripened in a vacuum package. ACE-inhibitory activity of the water soluble extracts (WSEs) of the cheeses increased significantly (P < 0.05) throughout the ripening (IC50 values 82.78-140.99 mug/ml). Use of Lb. acidophilus DSMZ 20079 and packaging under vacuum significantly increased the percentage of ACE inhibiting activity. WSEs had DPPH scavenging activity (the IC50 values were 2.41-5.39 mg/ml and the inhibition values were 5.10-10.38%), increasing up to 60 d ripening. In the present study, it was observed that Lb. acidophilus DSMZ 20079 was more effective than Bifido. bifidum DSMZ 20456 in terms of the cheese characteristics investigated.
TI  - The canine isolate Lactobacillus acidophilus LAB20 adheres to intestinal epithelium and attenuates LPS-induced IL-8 secretion of enterocytes in vitro.
AB  - BACKGROUND: For a good probiotic candidate, the abilities to adhere to intestinal epithelium and to fortify barrier function are considered to be crucial for colonization and functionality of the strain. The strain Lactobacillus acidophilus LAB20 was isolated from the jejunum of a healthy dog, where it was found to be the most pre-dominant lactobacilli. In this study, the adhesion ability of LAB20 to intestinal epithelial cell (IECs) lines, IECs isolated from canine intestinal biopsies, and to canine, porcine and human intestinal mucus was investigated. Further, we studied the ability of LAB20 to fortify the epithelial cell monolayer and to reduce LPS-induced interleukin (IL-8) release from enterocytes. RESULTS: We found that LAB20 presented higher adhesion to canine colonic mucus as compared to mucus isolated from porcine colon. LAB20 showed adhesion to HT-29 and Caco-2 cell lines, and importantly also to canine IECs isolated from canine intestinal biopsies. In addition, LAB20 increased the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) of enterocyte monolayers and thus strengthened the intestinal barrier function. The strain showed also anti-inflammatory capacity in being able to attenuate the LPS-induced IL-8 production of HT-29 cells. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, canine indigenous strain LAB20 is a potential probiotic candidate for dogs adhering to the host epithelium and showing intestinal barrier fortifying and anti-inflammatory effects.
TI  - Yogurt Containing the Probacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus Combined with Natural Antioxidants Mitigates Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiomyopathy in Rats.
AB  - Probiotics and antioxidants have a definite improving effect in cardiovascular diseases. This study aims at mitigating doxorubicin toxicity on cardiac function through consuming a functional food. Five groups of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were used along 22 weeks. Group I received 30 g/kg/day food enriched with yogurt, green tea extract, and carrots (80, 0.84, and 100 g/kg diet, respectively) from the first week, group II received carvedilol 30 mg/kg/day orally from week 17, group III received both carvedilol and tested food, and groups IV and V were +ve and -ve control groups, respectively. In week 17, cardiomyopathy was induced by i.p. injection of 2.5 mg/kg doxorubicin every 48 h for 2 weeks. Histopathological and electrophysiological examinations and biochemical analysis were done. Lipid peroxidation, antioxidant effect, heart failure compensatory mediators, and proinflammatory cytokines were assessed. Tested food normalized time between the start of Q wave and the end of T wave on electrocardiogram (QT interval) and heart rate compared to the doxorubicin group (P<.05). It also improved hypertrophy indicated by a significant (P<.05) decrease in heart/body weight ratio, angiotensin-II (Ang-II), and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) serum levels. Histopathological examination of cardiac sections from the tested food group revealed less marked vacuolization and low perivascular fibrosis percentage (0.7803+/-0.04). A significant (P<.001) decrease in serum creatine kinase-membrane bound, lactate dehydrogenase, triglycerides, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) levels was observed in addition to an increase in serum Na+/K+ ATP1A1 and cardiac reduced glutathione (GSH) levels. Tested food also lowered the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) serum levels significantly (P<.01). Probiotic food containing Lactobacillus acidophilus, green tea, and carrots can improve membrane integrity and cardiac contractility in doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy by decreasing TNF-alpha, IL-6, MDA, increasing GSH, and modulating compensatory mediators such as Ang-II and ANP.
TI  - Can probiotic yogurt prevent diarrhoea in children on antibiotics? A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the efficacy of a probiotic yogurt compared to a pasteurised yogurt for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in children. DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a multisite, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted between September 2009 and 2012. The study was conducted through general practices and pharmacies in Launceston, Tasmania, Australia. PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Children (aged 1-12 years) prescribed antibiotics, were randomised to receive 200 g/day of either yogurt (probiotic) containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), Bifidobacterium lactis (Bb-12) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (La-5) or a pasteurised yogurt (placebo) for the same duration as their antibiotic treatment. OUTCOMES: Stool frequency and consistency were recorded for the duration of treatment plus 1 week. Primary outcome was stool frequency and consistency, classified at different levels of diarrhoea severity. Due to the small number of cases of diarrhoea, comparisons between groups were made using Fisher's exact analysis. RESULTS: 72 children commenced and 70 children (36 placebo and 34 probiotic) completed the trial. There were no incidents of severe diarrhoea (stool consistency >/=6, >/=3 stools/day for >/=2 consecutive days) in the probiotic group and six in the placebo group (Fisher's exact p=0.025). There was also only one episode of minor diarrhoea (stool consistency >/=5, >/=2 stools/day for >/=2 days in the probiotic group compared to 21 in the placebo group (Fisher's exact p<0.001). The probiotic group reported fewer adverse events (1 had abdominal pain, 1 vomited and 1 had headache) than the placebo group (6 had abdominal pain, 4 had loss of appetite and 1 had nausea). CONCLUSIONS: A yogurt combination of LGG, La-5 and Bb-12 is an effective method for reducing the incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in children. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12609000281291.
TI  - The Natural Antimicrobial Subtilosin A Synergizes with Lauramide Arginine Ethyl Ester (LAE), epsilon-Poly-L-lysine (Polylysine), Clindamycin Phosphate and Metronidazole, Against the Vaginal Pathogen Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common, recurrent vaginal infection linked to increased chances of preterm delivery, incidence of sexually transmitted infections and fertility problems. BV is caused by a shift of the vaginal ecosystem from predominately Lactobacillus to a multispecies Actinomyces biofilm with the most common representatives identified as Gardnerella vaginalis and Prevotella spp. Current treatments have been associated with increased resistance as well as negative effects on healthy microbiota. The objective of this study was to evaluate the synergistic potential of ten two-antimicrobial combinations against G. vaginalis and four representative lactobacilli. The four tested antimicrobials were lauramide arginine ethyl ester, epsilon-poly-L-lysine, clindamycin phosphate, metronidazole and the bacteriocin subtilosin A. The use of bacteriocins as either synergist or alternative treatment positions bacteriocins as an excellent alternative to current antibiotics. The microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each of the antimicrobials individually, and the checkerboard assay was used to evaluate these MICs in combination. Clindamycin and subtilosin (CS), and metronidazole and subtilosin were synergistic against G. vaginalis in terms of fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI). All tested combinations were found to have Bliss synergy. The combination of clindamycin and polylysine (CP) was identified as antagonistic against L. acidophilus in terms of both FICI and Bliss synergy. The combination of clindamycin and metronidazole (CM) was antagonistic against L. vaginalis for both FICI and Bliss synergy. The combinations of CP, clindamycin and LAE, CS, and LAE and polylysine were identified as Bliss antagonistic against L. vaginalis but did not indicate FICI antagonism.
TI  - Clinical Characteristics of Symptomatic Clostridium difficile Infection in Children: Conditions as Infection Risks and Whether Probiotics Is Effective.
AB  - PURPOSE: This study investigated the clinical presentations of symptomatic Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in children. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 43 children aged <20 years who showed either positive C. difficile culture or C. difficile toxin test results between June 2010 and April 2014. RESULTS: Of the 43 patients (mean age 6.7 years), 22 were boys. Sixteen patients (37.2%) showed both positive C. difficile culture and toxin test results. Seventeen out of 43 children (39.5%) had preexisting gastrointestinal diseases, and 26 children had other medical conditions that were risk factors for CDI. Twenty-eight children had a history of antibiotic treatment for >3 days, and the most frequently prescribed antibiotic was amoxicillin-clavulanate (35.7%). Twenty-eight patients were diagnosed with CDI despite taking probiotic supplements, most commonly Lactobacillus acidophilus (53.6%). The most common symptom was diarrhea (72.1%) at the time CDI was diagnosed. C. difficile was eradicated in 11 patients (25.6%) after treatment with oral metronidazole for 10-14 days, and in the two patients (4.6%) who required two courses of oral metronidazole. Sixteen patients (37.2%) showed clinical improvement without any treatment. CONCLUSION: This study showed the various clinical characteristics of CDI in children and that preexisting clinical conditions favored the development of CDI. In addition, CDI was found to occur in a number of patients even after probiotic prophylaxis given in conjunction with antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus dietary supplementation on the performance,  intestinal barrier function, rectal microflora and serum immune function in weaned piglets challenged with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide.
AB  - This study was conducted with a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged piglet model  to determine the effects of diets containing Lactobacillus acidophilus on the performance, intestinal barrier function, rectal microflora and serum immune function. A total of 150 piglets (initial body weight (BW) 7.53 +/- 0.21 kg) were allotted to one of the following diets, including a basal diet, a basal diet supplemented with 250 mg/kg Flavomycin, or basal diet plus 0.05, 0.1 or 0.2 % L. acidophilus. On day 28 of the trial, the pigs were given an intraperitoneal injection of LPS (200 mug/kg body weight) followed by blood collection 3 h later. Diets with either antibiotics, 0.1 or 0.2 % Lactobacillus increased (P < 0.05) the final BW and decreased (P < 0.05) feed gain ratio (F/G) compared with the control group. Pigs fed diets containing antibiotic or Lactobacillus had greater average daily gain (ADG) (P < 0.05) than pigs fed the control diet. The rectal content Lactobacillus counts for pigs fed diet containing Lactobacillus were significant higher (P < 0.01) than those fed antibiotic or control diet. Feeding the Lactobacillus diets decreased the Escherichia coli counts of rectal content (P < 0.01). Pigs fed diets containing 0.1 or 0.2 % Lactobacillus decreased serum DAO activity (P < 0.05) compared with pigs fed the control diet. Serum IL-10 concentration was enhanced in pigs fed the diet with Lactobacillus compared to pigs fed the control diet and antibiotic diet. Feeding a diet with Lactobacillus reduced (P < 0.05) IFN-gamma concentration compared to the control diet. Inclusion of Lactobacillus in diets fed to pigs reduced TNF-alpha concentration compared with pigs fed no Lactobacillus (P < 0.05). These results indicate that feeding with L. acidophilus improved growth performance and protected against LPS-induced inflammatory status.
TI  - Probiotic bacteria lactobacillus and bifidobacterium attenuate inflammation in dextran sulfate sodium-induced experimental colitis in mice.
AB  - It is widely accepted that inflammatory Bowel disease (IBD) arises from a dysregulated mucosal immune response to the enteric microbiota in the gut of a genetically susceptible individual. No definitive therapies are available for this inflammatory disorder. Therefore it became imperative to develop new strategies for treating this disease. Probiotics have emerged as a potential new therapeutic strategy for IBD, however their exact mechanisms of action is still poorly defined. In this study, we address the potential effect of a probiotic cocktail (Ultrabiotique(R)) composed of four live bacterial strains (L. acidophilus, L. plantarum, B. lactis and B.breve) to promote recovery from acute colitis. Probiotic was given to mice by oral gavage after the onset of colitis and the establishment of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced intestinal injury. Clinical parameters were monitored daily, histological scores of colitis and the production of nitric oxide (NO) and interferon-&#947; (IFN-&#947;) were determined. In addition, TLR4, NF-&#954;B and iNOS colonic expression were examined. Probiotic treatment ameliorated clinical symptoms and histological scores. NO and IFN-&#947; production in plasma were decreased by probiotic. These results were associated with reduced TLR4, iNOS and NF-&#1082;B expression in colonic tissue. In conclusion, probiotic exerted anti-inflammatory effects and contributed to a rapid recovery of DSS-induced acute colitis.
TI  - Regulatory role of Lactobacillus acidophilus on inflammation and gastric dysmotility in intestinal mucositis induced by 5-fluorouracil in mice.
AB  - PURPOSE: Lactobacillus acidophilus is widely used for gastrointestinal disorders, but its role in inflammatory conditions like in chemotherapy-induced mucositis is unclear. Here, we report the effect of L. acidophilus on 5-fluorouracil-induced (5-FU) intestinal mucositis in mice. METHODS: Mice weighing 25-30 g (n = 8) were separated into three groups, saline, 5-FU, and 5-FU + L. acidophilus (5-FU-La) (16 x 10(9) CFU/kg). In the 5-FU-La group, L. acidophilus was administered concomitantly with 5-FU on the first day and alone for two additional days. Three days after the last administration of L. acidophilus, the animals were euthanized and the jejunum and ileum were removed for histopathological assessment and for evaluation of levels of myeloperoxidase activity, sulfhydryl groups, nitrite, and cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, CXCL-1, and IL-10). In addition, we investigated gastric emptying using spectrophotometry after feeding a 1.5-ml test meal by gavage and euthanasia. Data were submitted to ANOVA and Bonferroni's test, with the level of significance at p < 0.05. RESULTS: Intestinal mucositis induced by 5-FU significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the villus height-crypt depth ratio and GSH concentration and increased myeloperoxidase activity and the nitrite concentrations compared with the control group. Furthermore, 5-FU significantly (p < 0.05) increased cytokine (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and CXCL-1) concentrations and decreased IL-10 concentrations compared with the control group. 5-FU also significantly (p < 0.05) delayed gastric emptying and gastrointestinal transit compared with the control group. All of these changes were significantly (p < 0.05) reversed by treatment with L. acidophilus. CONCLUSIONS: Lactobacillus acidophilus improves the inflammatory and functional aspects of intestinal mucositis induced by 5-FU.
TI  - Effect of aqueous and alcoholic Stevia (Stevia rebaudiana) extracts against Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus in comparison to chlorhexidine: An in vitro study.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Stevia (S. rebaudiana) a herb which has medicinal value and was used in ancient times as a remedy for a great diversity of ailments and sweetener. Leaves of Stevia contain a high concentration of Stevioside and Rebaudioside which are supposed to be sweetening agents. AIM: To compare the efficacy of aqueous and alcoholic S. rebaudiana extract against Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus in comparison to chlorhexidine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the first part of the study, various concentrations of aqueous and ethanolic Stevia extract were prepared in the laboratory of Pharmacy College. It was then subjected to microbiological assay to determine its zone of inhibition using Agar disk diffusion test and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) using serial broth dilution method against Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Chlorhexidine was used as a positive control. One way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test was used for multiple group comparisons followed by Tukey post hoc for group wise comparisons. RESULTS: Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of aqueous and ethnolic Stevia extract against Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus were 25% and 12.5% respectively. Mean zone of inhibition of the aqueous and alcoholic Stevia extracts against Streptococcus mutans at 48 hours were 22.8 mm and 26.7 mm respectively. Mean zone of inhibition of the aqueous and alcoholic Stevia extracts against Lactobacillus acidophilus at 48 hours were 14.4 mm and 15.1 mm respectively. Mean zone of inhibition of the chlorhexidine against Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus at 48 hours was 20.5 and 13.2 respectively. CONCLUSION: The inhibitory effect shown by alcoholic Stevia extract against Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus was superior when compared with that of aqueous form and was inferior when compared with Chlorhexidine.
TI  - Cholesterol-lowering potentials of lactic acid bacteria based on bile-salt hydrolase activity and effect of potent strains on cholesterol metabolism in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - This study collected different probiotic isolates from animal and plant sources to evaluate the bile-salt hydrolase activity of probiotics in vitro. The deconjugation potential of bile acid was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. HepG2 cells were cultured with probiotic strains with high BSH activity. The triglyceride (TG) and apolipoprotein B (apo B) secretion by HepG2 cells were evaluated. Our results show that the BSH activity and bile-acid deconjugation abilities of Pediococcus acidilactici NBHK002, Bifidobacterium adolescentis NBHK006, Lactobacillus rhamnosus NBHK007, and Lactobacillus acidophilus NBHK008 were higher than those of the other probiotic strains. The cholesterol concentration in cholesterol micelles was reduced within 24 h. NBHK007 reduced the TG secretion by 100% after 48 h of incubation. NBHK002, NBHK006, and NBHK007 could reduce apo B secretion by 33%, 38%, and 39%, respectively, after 24 h of incubation. The product PROBIO S-23 produced a greater decrease in the total concentration of cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, TG, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance in the serum or livers of hamsters with hypercholesterolemia compared with that of hamsters fed with a high-fat and high-cholesterol diet. These results show that the three probiotic strains of lactic acid bacteria are better candidates for reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of Camellia sinensis extract against cariogenic microorganisms.
AB  - CONTEXT: Dental caries, a ubiquitous multifactorial infectious disease, is primarily caused by microorganisms like Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Use of antimicrobials is an important strategy to curb cariogenic microorganisms. AIM: The aim was to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of C. sinensis extract on S. mutans and L. acidophilus. STUDY SETTING AND DESIGN: Experimental design, in vitro study, lab setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Aqueous, acetone and ethanolic extracts of C. sinensis were subjected to antioxidant analysis. The ethanolic extract was used for assessment of antimicrobial properties. Ethanolic green tea extract at ten different concentrations and 0.2% chlorhexidine was used. Microbiological investigations were carried out to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and zone of Inhibition of the test and control agents against S. mutans and L. acidophilus. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Kruskall-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U-test. RESULTS: MIC of green tea extract on S. mutans and L. acidophilus was found to be 0.2% and 0.3% respectively, MBC was found to be 0.8% and 0.9%, respectively. The mean zone of inhibition for 30 mul containing 300 mug of ethanolic extract of green tea and control against S. mutans were 18.33 mm and 14.67 mm, respectively. The mean zone of inhibition for 30 mul containing 300 mug of ethanolic extract of green tea and control against L. acidophilus were 12.67 mm and 7.33 mm, respectively. CONCLUSION: Green tea has antibacterial activity against predominant cariogenic bacteria namely S. mutans and L. acidophilus.
TI  - Construction and validation of a mCherry protein vector for promoter analysis in  Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Lactobacilli are widespread in natural environments and are increasingly being investigated as potential health modulators. In this study, we have adapted the broad-host-range vector pNZ8048 to express the mCherry protein (pRCR) to expand the usage of the mCherry protein for analysis of gene expression in Lactobacillus. This vector is also able to replicate in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. The usage of pRCR as a promoter probe was validated in Lactobacillus acidophilus by characterizing the regulation of lactacin B expression. The results show that the regulation is exerted at the transcriptional level, with lbaB gene expression being specifically induced by co-culture of the L. acidophilus bacteriocin producer and the S. thermophilus STY-31 inducer bacterium.
TI  - Effect of Bile Salt Hydrolase Inhibitors on a Bile Salt Hydrolase from Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Bile salt hydrolase (BSH), a widely distributed function of the gut microbiota, has a profound impact on host lipid metabolism and energy harvest. Recent studies suggest that BSH inhibitors are promising alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters (AGP) for enhanced animal growth performance and food safety. Using a high-purity BSH from Lactobacillus salivarius strain, we have identified a panel of BSH inhibitors. However, it is still unknown if these inhibitors also effectively inhibit the function of the BSH enzymes from other bacterial species with different sequence and substrate spectrum. In this study, we performed bioinformatics analysis and determined the inhibitory effect of identified BSH inhibitors on a BSH from L. acidophilus. Although the L. acidophilus BSH is phylogenetically distant from the L. salivarius BSH, sequence analysis and structure modeling indicated the two BSH enzymes contain conserved, catalytically important amino residues and domain. His-tagged recombinant BSH from L. acidophilus was further purified and used to determine inhibitory effect of specific compounds. Previously identified BSH inhibitors also exhibited potent inhibitory effects on the L. acidophilus BSH. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the BSH from L. salivarius is an ideal candidate for screening BSH inhibitors, the promising alternatives to AGP for enhanced feed efficiency, growth performance and profitability of food animals.
TI  - Gentio-oligosaccharides from Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-1426 dextransucrase as prebiotics and as a supplement for functional foods with anti-cancer properties.
AB  - Gentio-oligosaccharides (GnOS) were synthesized by the acceptor reaction of dextransucrase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-1426 with gentiobiose and sucrose. GnOS were purified by gel permeation chromatography using a Bio-Gel P-2 column and identified by mass spectrometry. The purified GnOS (degree of polymerization >/=3) were investigated for their in vitro prebiotic and cytotoxic activity. GnOS exhibited a significantly lower degree of digestibility of 18.1% by simulated human gastric juice (pH 1.0) and 7.1% by human alpha-amylase (pH 7.0) after 6 h, whereas inulin, a standard prebiotic, showed 39.7% and 12.8% of digestibility, respectively. The prebiotic score showed that GnOS significantly supported the growth of probiotics such as Bifidobacterium infantis and Lactobacillus acidophilus and was comparable to that of inulin. The selective inhibitory effect of GnOS on human colon carcinoma (HT-29) cells revealed its potential as an anti-cancer agent that can serve as a functional food additive for the benefit of human health.
TI  - Improved eradication rate of standard triple therapy by adding bismuth and probiotic supplement for Helicobacter pylori treatment in Thailand.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) remains an important cause of gastric cancer and peptic ulcer disease worldwide. Treatment of H. pylori infection is one of the effective ways to prevent gastric cancer. However, standard triple therapy for H. pylori eradication is no longer effective in many countries, including Thailand. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of adding bismuth and probiotic to standard triple therapy for H. pylori eradication. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective single center study, H. pylori infected gastritis patients were randomized to receive 7- or 14-day standard triple therapy plus bismuth with probiotic or placebo. Treatment regimen consisted of 30 mg lansoprazole twice daily, 1 g amoxicillin twice daily, 1 g clarithromycin MR once daily and 1,048 mg bismuth subsalicylate twice daily. Probiotic bacteria composed of Bifidobacterium lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus paracasei. Placebo was conventional drinking yogurt without probiotic. CYP2C19 genotyping and antibiotic susceptibility tests were also done. H pylori eradication was defined as a negative 13C-urea breath test at least 2 weeks after completion of treatment. RESULTS: One hundred subjects were enrolled (25 each to 7- and 14-day regimens with probiotic or placebo). Antibiotic susceptibility tests showed 36.7% metronidazole and 1.1% clarithromycin resistance. CYP2C19 genotyping revealed 40.8%, 49% and 10.2% were rapid, intermediate and poor metabolizers, respectively. The eradication rates of 7- or 14 regimens with probiotics were 100%. Regarding adverse events, the incidence of bitter taste was significantly lower in the 7- day regimen with the probiotic group compared with 7- day regimen with placebo (40% vs. 64%; p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The 7-day standard triple therapy plus bismuth and probiotic can provide an excellent cure rate of H. pylori (100%) in areas with low clarithromycin resistance such as Thailand, regardless of CYP2C19 genotype. Adding a probiotic also reduced treatment-related adverse events.
TI  - The effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus as feed supplement on skin mucosal immune parameters, intestinal microbiota, stress resistance and growth performance of black swordtail (Xiphophorus helleri).
AB  - The present study evaluates the effects of different levels of dietary Lactobacillus acidophilus as feed supplement on intestinal microbiota, skin mucus immune parameters and salinity stress resistance as well as growth performance of black swordtail (Xiphophorus helleri). One-thousand and eight hundred healthy black swordtail larvae (0.03 +/- 0.001 g) were randomly distributed in 12 tanks (100 L) at a density of 150 fish per aquaria and fed different levels of dietary L. acidophilus (0, 1.5 x 10(8), 3 x 10(8) and 6 x 10(8) CFU g(-1)) for 10 weeks. At the end of trial, there were significant differences among antibacterial activity of skin mucus in probiotic fed fish and control group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the skin mucus protein level and alkaline phosphatase activity in control group were significantly lower than those of L. acidophilus fed fish (P < 0.05). Microbiological assessments revealed that feeding with probiotic supplemented diet remarkably increased total autochthonous bacteria and autochthonous lactic acid bacteria levels (P < 0.05). The results showed that dietary administration of L. acidophilus significantly elevated black swordtail resistance against salinity stress (i.e survival %) (P < 0.05). Also, dietary administration of different levels of L. acidophilus improved weight gain, SGR, FCR compared to fish fed unsupplemented diet (P < 0.05). These results demonstrate beneficial effects of dietary L. acidophilus on mucosal immune parameters, intestinal microbiota, stress resistance and growth parameters of black swordtail and the appropriate inclusion is 6 x 10(8) CFU g(-1).
TI  - Effect of probiotic supplementation on bacterial translocation in common bile duct obstruction.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of probiotics on bacterial translocation in the obstructive common bile duct with comparison to an enteral product containing arginine and glutamine. MATERIAL AND METHOD: In our study, 40 Sprague-Dawley rats each weighing 250-300 g were used. Animals in Group 1 (sham) were laparatomized and fed standard chow supplemented with physiologic saline at daily doses of 2 ml through orogastric tube for 7 days. Common bile ducts of the animals in the other groups were ligated with 3/0 silk sutures. Group 2 (control group) was fed standard chow supplemented with daily doses of 2 ml physiologic saline. Group 3 (probiotic group) was fed standard chow supplemented with a probiotic solution (Acidophilus plus) containing strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium bifidum and Lactobacillus bulgaricus at a daily doses of 2 x 10(9) colony forming units (CFU). Group 4 (formula group) was fed only an enteral solution (Stresson Multi Fiber) containing glutamine, arginine and a medium-chain fatty acid at daily doses of 2 g/kg. At the end of the 7th day, all animals were relaparatomized, and to determine bacterial translocation, aerobic, and anaerobic cultures were obtained from the specimens of mesenteric lymph nodes, intestinal mucosa, and blood samples. Smear cultures prepared from caecum were examined to determine the number of CFU. Finally, for histological examination specimens were excised from terminal ileum, and oxidative damage was assessed in liver tissues. Afterwards all animals were killed. RESULTS: Moderately lesser degrees of bacterial translocation, and mucosal damage were seen in Groups 3, and 4 relative to Group 2 (p < 0.05). In Group 4, any difference was not seen in the number of cecal bacteria relative to baseline values, while in Group 3, significant decrease in cecal colonization was seen. Among all groups, a significant difference between levels of malondialdehyde, and glutathione was not observed. CONCLUSION: At the end of our study, we have concluded that both probiotics, and enteral diets which contain immunomodulators such as glutamine, and arginine alleviate bacterial translocation, and impairment of intestinal mucosa.
TI  - Sortase-deficient lactobacilli: effect on immunomodulation and gut retention.
AB  - Surface proteins of probiotic microbes, including Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus gasseri, are believed to promote retention in the gut and mediate host-bacterial communications. Sortase, an enzyme that covalently couples a subset of extracellular proteins containing an LPXTG motif to the cell surface, is of particular interest in characterizing bacterial adherence and communication with the mucosal immune system. A sortase gene, srtA, was identified in L. acidophilus NCFM (LBA1244) and L. gasseri ATCC 33323 (LGAS_0825). Additionally, eight and six intact sortase-dependent proteins were predicted in L. acidophilus and L. gasseri, respectively. Due to the role of sortase in coupling these proteins to the cell wall, DeltasrtA deletion mutants of L. acidophilus and L. gasseri were created using the upp-based counterselective gene replacement system. Inactivation of sortase did not cause significant alteration in growth or survival in simulated gastrointestinal juices. Meanwhile, both DeltasrtA mutants showed decreased adhesion to porcine mucin in vitro. Murine dendritic cells exposed to the DeltasrtA mutant of L. acidophilus or L. gasseri induced lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-12, respectively, compared with the parent strains. In vivo co-colonization of the L. acidophilus DeltasrtA mutant and its parent strain in germ-free 129S6/SvEv mice resulted in a significant one-log reduction of the DeltasrtA mutant population. Additionally, a similar reduction of the DeltasrtA mutant was observed in the caecum. This study shows for the first time that sortase-dependent proteins contribute to gut retention of probiotic microbes in the gastrointestinal tract.
TI  - Probiotic and Prebiotic-probiotic PEC Microparticles for Sustaining and Enhancing Intestinal Probiotic Growth.
AB  - The aim of the study was to develop and evaluate Polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) microparticles composing Lactobacillus Acidophilus (probiotic) and Fructo oligosaccharide-Lactobacillus Acidophilus (prebiotic-probiotic), for sustaining and enhancing intestinal growth of probiotic bacteria. Gum Karaya-Chitosan(GK-CH) was used to fabricate PEC microparticles by extrusion method. The prepared microparticles were characterized for FT-IR, DSC and particle size and evaluated for percentage yield, swelling, surface morphology, entrapment rate and further studied for influence of prebiotic over probiotic growth. The fabricated PEC microparticles composed of Probiotic and Prebiotic- Probiotic have exhibited sustainability of probiotic bacteria for 12 hrs in GIT conditions and presence of prebiotic in the preparation enhanced the probiotic cell growth. Hence, it can be concluded that PEC between GK-CH was found to be successful in sustaining cell release and presence of prebiotic was found to enhance the probiotic cell growth.
TI  - Evaluation of culture media for selective enumeration of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to test the suitability of Transgalactosylated oligosaccharides-mupirocin lithium salt (TOS-MUP) and MRS-clindamycin-ciprofloxacin (MRS-CC) agars, along with several other culture media, for selectively enumerating bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) species commonly used to make fermented milks. Pure culture suspensions of a total of 13 dairy bacteria strains, belonging to eight species and five genera, were tested for growth capability under various incubation conditions. TOS-MUP agar was successfully used for the selective enumeration of both Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 and B. breve M-16 V. MRS-CC agar showed relatively good selectivity for Lactobacillus acidophilus, however, it also promoted the growth of Lb. casei strains. For this reason, MRS-CC agar can only be used as a selective medium for the enumeration of Lb. acidophilus if Lb. casei is not present in a product at levels similar to or exceeding those of Lb. acidophilus. Unlike bifidobacteria and coccus-shaped LAB, all the lactobacilli strains involved in this work were found to grow well in MRS pH 5.4 agar incubated under anaerobiosis at 37 degrees C for 72 h. Therefore, this method proved to be particularly suitable for the selective enumeration of Lactobacillus spp.
TI  - Performance evaluation of bulk freeze dried starter cultures of dahi and yoghurt  along with probiotic strains in standardized milk of cow and buffalo.
AB  - Performance of bulk freeze dried (BFD) cultures of dahi (D) and yoghurt (Y) either with or without probiotic cultures (AB -Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum) in standardized milk of cow and buffalo was evaluated. In buffalo milk, significantly (p < 0.05) low viable count of probiotic culture combination of dahi cultures (DAB) over non probiotic combination (D) was noticed; whereas, difference in counts of yoghurt culture combinations Y and YAB was not significant. The culture activity of D and DAB was similar in both types of milk, however, the volatile acidity (VA) produced by combination D was higher (32.5 ml/50 g sample) in buffalo milk than in cow milk (29.2 ml/50 g sample). Whereas, DAB produced very low amount of VA (16 ml/50 g sample) both in cow and buffalo milk. The diacetyl and tyrosine contents produced by either D or DAB in cow or buffalo milk were in the same order. Although Y and YAB produced slightly more VA in buffalo milk than in cow milk, significant change in the performance of yoghurt cultures (Y or YAB) both in cow and buffalo milk was not noticed. However, the VA and acetaldehyde produced by YAB either in cow and buffalo milk was higher than that by combination Y. Addition of probiotic cultures significantly enhanced the production of acetaldehyde content in both types of milk. Difference in tyrosine content in yoghurt made either with cow or buffalo milk was not significant. Overall, the present study indicated that the BFD cultures can be used to prepare dahi or yoghurt either from cow or buffalo milk, without affecting the biochemical profile of these products.
TI  - Development of sprouted wheat based probiotic beverage.
AB  - Present study was carried out to evaluate the potential of Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) for development of wheat based probiotic beverage and to optimize the proportion of different ingredients viz. sprouted wheat flour, sprouted wheat bran, oat and stabilizer using response surface methodology. Acidity, pH and probiotic count of samples prepared with L. acidophilus NCDC-14 was higher than that of L. acidophilus NCDC-16 culture. Being more compatible, L. acidophilus NCDC-14 was selected for this study. Acidity (in terms of lactic acid), pH and probiotic count of the different samples ranged from 0.21 to 0.45 %, 4.0 to 4.9, and 8.30 to 10.95 log10 cfu mL(-1), respectively. Probiotic count increased with increasing amount of sprouted wheat and oat. Optimized levels for sprouted wheat flour, oat, wheat bran and guar gum were 7.86, 5.42, 1.42 and 0.6 g, respectively per 100 mL of water. Optimized probiotic beverage provided 13.19 % total solids, 1.19 % protein, 0.33 % fat, 0.10 % ash, 0.42 % crude fibre, 1.45 mg iron, calcium 15.74 mg, 11.56 % carbohydrates, 54 kcal calories and 10.43 log10 cfu mL(-1) probiotic count. Thus, Lactobacillus acidophilus NCDC-14 can be used for development of potentially probiotic beverage with sprouted wheat and oat.
TI  - Effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus NS1 on plasma cholesterol levels in diet-induced obese mice.
AB  - We investigated the probiotic properties of Lactobacillus acidophilus NS1, such as acid resistance, bile tolerance, adherence to HT-29 cells, and cholesterol assimilation activity. In an animal study, 7-wk-old male C57BL/6 mice were fed a normal diet, a high-fat diet (HFD), or an HFD with L. acidophilus NS1 (ca. 1.0x10(8) cfu/mL) for 10 wk. Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels were significantly lower in mice fed an HFD with L. acidophilus NS1 than in those fed an HFD only, whereas high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were similar between these 2 groups. To understand the mechanism of the cholesterol-lowering effect of L. acidophilus NS1 on the HFD-mediated increase in plasma cholesterol levels, we determined mRNA levels of genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis in the liver. Expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (Srebp2) and LDL receptor (Ldlr) in the liver was dramatically reduced in mice fed a HFD compared with those fed a normal diet. When L. acidophilus NS1 was administered orally to HFD-fed mice, an HFD-induced suppression of Srebp2 and Ldlr expression in the liver was abolished. These results suggest that the oral administration of L. acidophilus NS1 to mice fed an HFD increased the expression of Srebp2 and Ldlr in the liver, which was inhibited by high fat intake, thus leading to a decrease in plasma cholesterol levels. Lactobacillus acidophilus NS1 could be a useful probiotic microorganism for cholesterol-lowering dairy products and the improvement of hyperlipidemia and hepatic lipid metabolism.
TI  - Probiotic bacteria, B. longum and L. acidophilus inhibit infection by rotavirus in vitro and decrease the duration of diarrhea in pediatric patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Evidence suggests that specific probiotics may be antagonistic to enteric pathogens and enhance immunity, and thus, provide a means of preventing or treating diarrheal diseases. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of probiotic strains isolated from Koreans for the treatment of viral gastroenteritis in young children and against rotavirus in vitro. METHODS: In vitro antiviral activities of probiotic isolates on rotavirus infection were investigated in the Vero cell using a plaque reduction assay. Then several probiotic strains with the high antiviral activity were chosen for further clinical trials. Twenty-nine pediatric patients who presented with symptoms of viral gastroenteritis were enrolled in a double-blind trial and randomly assigned at admission to receive six probiotic strains (Bifidobacterium longum, B. lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, L. plantarum, and Pediococcus pentosaceus) at a dose of 10(9) colony forming units/g or a comparable placebo twice daily for 1 week. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Of the tested probiotic strains, B. longum isolated from an infant showed the greatest inhibitory effect and L. acidophilus showed the second-highest inhibitory effect. These probiotics significantly shortened the duration of diarrhea as compared with a placebo (6.1 +/- 0.5 vs 7.2 +/- 1.9, P = 0.030) and did not induce any adverse effects. Our findings suggest that the probiotic strains selected in the present study may be useful for the treatment of acute rotaviral gastroenteritis or as an alternative therapy without adverse effects.
TI  - A closed loop for municipal organic solid waste by lactic acid fermentation.
AB  - In order to investigate the feasibility of producing lactic acid from municipal organic solid waste different pH values (4-7) and temperatures (37 degrees C and 55 degrees C) were tested. For the evaluation of fermentation conditions the chemical, physical, and microbial characters were monitored over a period of 7days. Quantitative real time PCR, PCR-DGGE, and next generation sequencing of a 16S rRNA gene library were applied to identify the key players of the lactic acid production and their association. Lactobacillus acidophilus and its closest relatives were found to be efficient lactic acid producers (>300mM) under most suitable fermentation conditions tested in this study: 37 degrees C with either uncontrolled pH or at a pH of 5. These data provide the first step in the realization of the idea "reuse, reduce, and recycle" of municipal organic solid waste.
TI  - Effect of a symbiotic gel (Lactobacillus acidophilus + Bifidobacterium lactis + inulin) on presence and severity of gastrointestinal symptoms in hemodialysis patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to assess the effect of a symbiotic gel on presence and severity of gastrointestinal symptoms (GIS) in hemodialysis patients. DESIGN: A double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized, clinical trial was designed. The study was conducted at 2 public hospitals in Guadalajara, Mexico. SUBJECTS AND INTERVENTION: Twenty-two patients were randomized to the intervention group (nutritional counseling + symbiotic gel) and 20 patients were randomized to the control group (nutritional counseling + placebo), during 2 months of follow-up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Presence and monthly episodes of GIS were assessed by direct interview and severity by using the self-administered GIS questionnaire. Additionally, biochemical parameters, inflammatory markers, and nutritional status (dietary intake, subjective global assessment, anthropometry, and body composition) were evaluated. RESULTS: After a 2-month treatment, intervention group had a significant reduction in prevalence and monthly episodes of vomit, heartburn, and stomachache, as well as a significant decrease in GIS severity compared with control group. Moreover, intervention group had a greater yet not significant decrease in the prevalence of malnutrition and a trend to reduce their C-reactive protein and tumor necrosis factor alpha levels compared with control group. No symbiotic-related adverse side effects were shown in these patients. Clinical studies with longer follow-up and sample size are needed to confirm these results. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that administration of a symbiotic gel is a safe and simple way to improve common GIS in dialysis patients.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus CP23 with weak immunomodulatory activity lacks anchoring structure for surface layer protein.
AB  - To determine the reason for the low levels of Surface layer protein A (SlpA) on CP23 cells, which might play a crucial role in the immunomodulatory effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus, the DNA sequence of the slpA gene of CP23 and L-92 strains, including the upstream region, were analyzed. Unexpectedly, there was no significant difference in the predicted amino acid sequence of the C-terminus needed for cell anchoring, and only an additional Ala-Val-Ala sequence inserted in the N-terminal region of the mature CP23 protein. Therefore, anchoring of SlpA on the cell wall of CP23 and L-92 was evaluated by a reconstitution assay, which showed that SlpA released by LiCl treatment from both CP23 and L-92 was successfully anchored on LiCl-treated L-92 cells, but not on LiCl-treated CP23 cells. Moreover, quantitative analysis of SlpA protein in the culture medium of CP23 and L-92 by ELISA revealed higher levels of SlpA secretion in CP23 cells than in L-92 cells. Collectively, these results suggest that the lower levels of SlpA on the surface of CP23 cells might be caused by less cell wall capacity for SlpA anchoring, leading to an accumulation of SlpA in the culture medium of CP23 cells. The present study supports the importance of cell surface structure of L. acidophilus L-92 for SlpA anchoring on the cell surface needed for immunomodulatory effect.
TI  - The domestication of the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus is a Gram-positive lactic acid bacterium that has had widespread historical use in the dairy industry and more recently as a probiotic. Although L. acidophilus has been designated as safe for human consumption, increasing commercial regulation and clinical demands for probiotic validation has resulted in a need to understand its genetic diversity. By drawing on large, well-characterised collections of lactic acid bacteria, we examined L. acidophilus isolates spanning 92 years and including multiple strains in current commercial use. Analysis of the whole genome sequence data set (34 isolate genomes) demonstrated L. acidophilus was a low diversity, monophyletic species with commercial isolates essentially identical at the sequence level. Our results indicate that commercial use has domesticated L. acidophilus with genetically stable, invariant strains being consumed globally by the human population.
TI  - Probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum) prevent NEC in VLBW infants fed breast milk but not formula.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Specific probiotics prevent necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). A mixture of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria (Infloran) was highly effective in Asian very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants. We analyzed the effect of Infloran on NEC, NEC severity, and the influence of enteral feedings (breast milk vs. formula) on NEC prevention in a cohort of European VLBW infants. METHODS: Infloran was implemented for routine use at our department. VLBW infants receiving probiotics were prospectively followed (2010-2012) and compared with historic controls (2008-2009). Data on NEC, neonatal morbidity, feeding tolerance, and descriptive parameters on NEC cases were analyzed. RESULTS: Infloran had no statistically significant impact on NEC (controls: 24/233 (10.3%); probiotics: 16/230 (7%); P = 0.2). However, NEC was significantly reduced in infants of the probiotics group who were fed any breast milk (20/179 (11.2%) vs. 10/183 (5.5%); P = 0.027), whereas it was ineffective in infants exclusively fed formula (4/54 (7.4%) vs. 6/44 (13.6%); P = 0.345). Occurrence of severe NEC (IIIb), time until full feeds, and gastric residuals were similar. CONCLUSION: Infloran was of lower efficacy in a European VLBW cohort and showed a reduction of NEC only in infants fed breast milk. Future studies should investigate the influence of feeding formula or breast milk on the effect of probiotics.
TI  - Insights into glycogen metabolism in Lactobacillus acidophilus: impact on carbohydrate metabolism, stress tolerance and gut retention.
AB  - In prokaryotic species equipped with glycogen metabolism machinery, the co-regulation of glycogen biosynthesis and degradation has been associated with the synthesis of energy storage compounds and various crucial physiological functions, including global cellular processes such as carbon and nitrogen metabolism, energy sensing and production, stress response and cell-cell communication. In addition, the glycogen metabolic pathway was proposed to serve as a carbon capacitor that regulates downstream carbon fluxes, and in some microorganisms the ability to synthesize intracellular glycogen has been implicated in host persistence. Among lactobacilli, complete glycogen metabolic pathway genes are present only in select species predominantly associated with mammalian hosts or natural environments. This observation highlights the potential involvement of glycogen biosynthesis in probiotic activities and persistence of intestinal lactobacilli in the human gastrointestinal tract. In this review, we summarize recent findings on (i) the presence and potential ecological distribution of glycogen metabolic pathways among lactobacilli, (ii) influence of carbon substrates and growth phases on glycogen metabolic gene expression and glycogen accumulation in L. acidophilus, and (iii) the involvement of glycogen metabolism on growth, sugar utilization and bile tolerance. Our present in vivo studies established the significance of glycogen biosynthesis on the competitive retention of L. acidophilus in the mouse intestinal tract, demonstrating for the first time that the ability to synthesize intracellular glycogen contributes to gut fitness and retention among probiotic microorganisms.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of children's toothpastes on Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis and Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - AIM: As suppression of Streptococcus mutans in young children may prevent or delay colonisation of the oral cavity, toothbrushing with dentifrices containing anti-S. mutans activity may aid in preventing caries. The aims of this study were to compare the effects of children's dentifrices on the growth of S. mutans and non-mutans bacteria (Streptococcus sanguinis and Lactobacillus acidophilus). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The agar diffusion assay at neutral pH was used to examine the antibacterial activity of commercial dentifrices and their major constituents. RESULTS: Dentifrices containing 1,450 ppm fluoride produced greater growth inhibition of both S. mutans and S. sanguinis than those with <500 ppm. No inhibition was seen for pure solutions of sodium fluoride or sodium monofluorophosphate at fluoride concentrations up to 100,000 ppm. Stannous fluoride exerted antibacterial effects at concentrations above 10,000 ppm. Significant growth inhibition of both S. mutans and S. sanguinis was seen with sodium lauryl sulphate at 2,500 ppm and with triclosan at 100 ppm. No inhibitory effects were seen for xylitol, sorbitol, sodium pyrophosphate or polyethylene glycol at concentrations up to 80,000 ppm. CONCLUSION: Sodium lauryl sulphate is the major bacterial inhibitory compound in children's dentifrices.
TI  - Effect of oral probiotics supplementation in the prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis among very low birth weight preterm infants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most serious gastrointestinal  problem in very low birth weight preterm infants. Multiple risk factors activate the inflammatory cascade leading to high expressions of pro-inflammatory mediators causing bowel injury in NEC. The anti-inflammatory effect of probiotics is due to the inhibition and reduction of inflammatory signal in intestinal epithelium. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of probiotics supplementation in the prevention of NEC among very low birth weight preterm infants. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective randomized controlled trial. MATERIAL AND METHOD: All preterm infants with gestational age less than or equal to 34 weeks and birth weight less than or equal to 1,500 grams admitted in neonatal care unit, Queen Sirikit National Institute of Child Health during June 1st, 2012 and January 31th, 2013 were enrolled in this study. They were randomized into two groups, study and control group. Infants in the study group were fed Infloran (Lactobacillus acidophilus 1 x 10(9) and Bifidobacterium bifidum 1 x 10(9) organisms) dose 125 mg/kg/dose twice a day with breast milk or premature formula from the start of feeding until 6 weeks or discharge. Infants in the control group were fed with either breast milk or premature formula alone. The primary outcome was NEC stage >/= 2. RESULTS: Sixty infants completed the study, 31 infants in the study group and 29 infants in the control group. The baseline characteristic data of infants were similar except for more males in the present study group. Incidence of NEC stage >/= 2 were similar in both the groups, 3.2 vs. 3.4% (p = 0.74). There were no deaths during the study period. Days to reach full feeding, 150 ml/kg/day, were no differences between the two groups, 12.03 +/- 5.49 days vs. 13.76 +/- 8.25 days (p = 0.31). No adverse effects such as sepsis, flatulence or diarrhea were noted. CONCLUSION: In this study, there was no difference in incidence of NEC stage >/= 2 between the two groups. No adverse effects of probiotics supplementation were observed.
TI  - Opposite effect of supernatants from selected periopathogens and oral lactobacilli cultures on ATP levels in human gingival fibroblasts.
AB  - Studies were performed on the effects of supernatants obtained from bacterial cultures, including cultures of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia and Lactobacillus acidophilus strains on ATP levels in human gingival fibroblasts (HGF-1) and on their viability. ATP levels were evaluated using luminescence test and cell viability was estimated using a fluorescence test. In control cultures mean levels of ATP in HGF-1 amounted to 4.90+/-0.32 mln RLU. Supernatants of P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans cultures were found to significantly reduce ATP production in HGF-1 (mean levels of ATP amounted to 3.41+/-0.33 and 3.55+/-0.3 mln RLU respectively), which was not accompanied by an increased proportion of dead fibroblasts. Supernatants of P. intermedia induced no significant alterations in ATP level in HGF-1. In turn, supernatants of L. acidophilus H2O2 (+) and H2O2 (-) cultures significantly increased ATP levels in HGF-1 (the mean levels amounted to 5.94+/-0.31 mln RLU and 5.88+/-0.28 mln RLU respectively). The results indicate that extracellular products of P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans most probably represent mitochondria-targeted peptides, which reduce synthesis of ATP in HGF-1. In turn, extracellular products of L. acidophilus seem to represent exopolysaccharides (EPS) with pro-oxidant activity, which stimulate synthesis of ATP in HGF-1.
TI  - Use of probiotics to reduce faecal shedding of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia  coli in sheep.
AB  - Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) are zoonotic, foodborne pathogens of humans. Ruminants, including sheep, are the primary reservoirs of STEC and there is a need to develop intervention strategies to reduce the entry of STEC into the food chain. The initiation of the majority of bacterial, enteric infections involves colonisation of the gut mucosal surface by the pathogen. However, probiotic bacteria can serve to decrease the severity of infection via a number of mechanisms including competition for receptors and nutrients, and/or the synthesis of organic acids and bacteriocins that create an environment unfavourable for pathogen development. The aim of the current study was to determine whether the administration of a probiotic mixture to sheep experimentally infected with a non-O157 STEC strain, carrying stx1, stx2 and eae genes, was able to decrease faecal shedding of the pathogen. The probiotic mixture contained Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Enterococcus faecium. The numbers of non-O157 STEC in faecal samples collected from sheep receiving daily doses of the probiotic mixture were significantly lower at the 3rd, 5th and 6th week post-inoculation when compared to the levels recorded in untreated animals. It was concluded that administration of the probiotic mixture reduced faecal shedding of non-O157 STEC in sheep, and holds potential as a pre-harvest intervention method to reduce transmission to humans.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus L-92 Cells Activate Expression of Immunomodulatory Genes in THP-1 Cells.
AB  - To understand the immunomodulatory effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus L-92 cells suggested from our previous study of in vivo anti-allergy and anti-virus effects, host immune responses in macrophage-like THP-1 cells after 4 h (the early phase) and 24 h (the late phase) of cocultivation with L-92 cells were investigated by transcriptome analysis. In the early phase of L-92 treatment, various transcription regulator genes, such as, NFkB1, NFkB2, JUN, HIVEP2 and RELB, and genes encoding chemokines and cytokines, such as CCL4, CXCL11, CCL3 and TNF, were upregulated. Two transmembrane receptor genes, TLR7 and ICAM1, were also upregulated in the early phase of treatment. In contrast, many transmembrane receptor genes, such as IL7R, CD80, CRLF2, CD86, CD5, HLA-DQA1, IL2RA, IL15RA and CSF2RA, and some cytokine genes, including IL6, IL23A and CCL22, were significantly upregulated in the late phase after L-92 exposure. Some genes encoding cytokines, such as IL1A, IL1B and IL8, and the enzyme IDO1 were upregulated at both the early and the late phases of treatment. These results suggest that probiotic L-92 might promote Th1 and regulatory T-cell responses by activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, followed by the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway in THP-1 cells.
TI  - Effects of Korean Red Ginseng (Panax ginseng), urushiol (Rhus vernicifera Stokes), and probiotics (Lactobacillus rhamnosus R0011 and Lactobacillus acidophilus R0052) on the gut-liver axis of alcoholic liver disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Roles of immune reaction and toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) have widely been established in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). METHODS: We evaluated the biologic efficacy of Korean Red Ginseng (KRG), urushiol, and probiotics (Lactobacillus rhamnosus R0011 and Lactobacillus acidophilus R0052) in mouse models of ALD. Sixty C57BL/6 mice were equally divided into six feeding groups for 10 weeks: normal diet, alcohol, control, alcohol + KRG, alcohol + urushiol, and alcohol + probiotics. Alcohol was administered via a Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet containing 10% alcohol. TLR-4 expression, proinflammatory cytokines, and histology, as well as the results of liver function tests were evaluated and compared. RESULTS: No between-group differences were observed with regard to liver function. TLR-4 levels were significantly lower in the KRG, urushiol, and probiotics groups than in the alcohol group (0.37 +/- 0.06 ng/mL, 0.39 +/- 0.12 ng/mL, and 0.33 +/- 0.07 ng/mL, respectively, vs. 0.88 +/- 0.31 ng/mL; p < 0.05). Interleukin-1beta levels in liver tissues were decreased among the probiotics and KRG groups. The tumor necrosis factor-alpha level of liver tissue was decreased in the KRG group. CONCLUSION: The pathological findings showed that alcohol-induced steatosis was significantly reduced by KRG and urushiol. As these agents improve immunologic capacity, they may be considered in potential anti-ALD treatments.
TI  - The effect of probiotics supplementation on Helicobacter pylori eradication rates and side effects during eradication therapy: a meta-analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous meta-analyses reported that probiotics improve the effectiveness of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication during antibiotic therapy, while results regarding a possible reduction of side effects remained inconclusive. Moreover, the effectiveness of different strains of probiotics has not been studied so far. It is further conceivable that probiotics will produce additional effects only if antibiotics are relatively ineffective. METHODS: This meta-analysis includes eligible randomized controlled trials examining effects of probiotics supplementation on eradication rates (ER) and side effects, published up to May 2014. Sub-group analysis was performed to compare different probiotic strains and antibiotic therapies with different effectiveness in controls (ER <80% vs.>80%). Publication bias was assessed with funnel plots and Harbord's test. The quality of the trials was assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS: Thirty-three RCTs involving a total of 4459 patients met the inclusion criteria in case of eradication rates of which 20 assessed total side effects in addition. Overall, the pooled eradication rate in probiotics supplementation groups was significantly higher than in controls (ITT analysis: RR 1.122, 95% CI 1.086-1.159, PP analysis: RR 1.114, 95% CI 1.070-1.159). Sub group-analysis could, however, confirm this finding only for four individual strains (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei DN-114001, Lactobacillus gasseri, and Bifidobacterium infantis 2036) and for relatively ineffective antibiotic therapies. There was a significant difference between groups in the overall incidence of side effects (RR 0.735, 95% CI 0.598-0.902). This result was, however, only confirmed for non-blinded trials. CONCLUSIONS: The pooled data suggest that supplementation with specific strains of probiotics compared with eradication therapy may be considered an option for increasing eradication rates, particularly when antibiotic therapies are relatively ineffective. The impact on side effects remains unclear and more high quality trials on specific probiotic strains and side effects are thus needed.
TI  - Local Probiotic Therapy for Vaginal Candida albicans Infections.
AB  - The high rate of vaginal Candida albicans recurrence is attributed to azole resistance rates as high as 15 %. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical and microbiological efficacy of standard azole therapy for treatment of vaginal C. albicans infection alone and in combination with local probiotic as well as the effects on vaginal microbiota. This study included 436 women with vaginal candidiasis randomly assigned to two treatment groups. The first group, with 207 patients (12 dropouts), was administered 150 mg fluconazole and a single vaginal globule of fenticonazole (600 mg) on the same day. The second group of 209 patients (8 dropouts) followed the same treatment schedule; however, ten applications of a vaginal probiotic containing Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus were also administered beginning the fifth day after azole treatment. Microbiological analysis of the therapy efficacy in the first treatment group showed C. albicans resistance in over 30 % of patients. Clinical complaints persisted after treatment administration in 79.7 % (n = 165) of women in this group. Clinical complaints in the second group decreased to 31.1 % (n = 65) and microbiological efficacy also improved among investigated parameters, from 93.7 % (n = 193) to 95.2 % (n = 198). The local application of probiotics after administration of combined azoles for treatment of vaginal C. albicans infections increases therapy efficacy and could prevent relapse.
TI  - Probiotics prophylaxis in infants with primary vesicoureteral reflux.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this era of increasing bacterial resistance to antimicrobial therapy, probiotics have great potential and yet they are a harmless alternative approach. This study is a prospective randomized uncontrolled trial to investigate the preventive effect of probiotic prophylaxis in infants with primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and frequently recurring urinary tract infection (UTI) during the first follow-up year. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-eight infants (aged 1 week to 12 months) with primary VUR were prospectively randomized into a probiotic (n = 64, Lactobacillus acidophilus, 1.0 x 10(8) CFU/g) or antibiotic (n = 64, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, 2/10 mg/kg) group. RESULTS: The incidence of recurrent UTI in the probiotic group was slightly lower than in the antibiotic group without statistical significance (32.8 % [21 out of 64] vs 40.6 % [26/64]) (P = 0.348). Causative organisms of recurrent UTI, resolution rate of VUR, and development of renal scarring were not different between the probiotic and antibiotic prophylaxis groups. The incidences of antibiotic resistance of causative organisms in recurrent UTI were significantly lower in the probiotic group than in the antibiotic group. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics could be considered a natural alternative regimen for prophylaxis in infants with primary VUR.
TI  - Effects of synbiotics injected in ovo on regulation of immune-related gene expression in adult chickens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine immunomodulatory effects of synbiotics administered in ovo on immune-related gene expression in adult chickens. ANIMALS: 30 Green-legged Partridgelike chickens. PROCEDURES: On incubation day 12, eggs were injected with 3 synbiotics (Lactococcus lactis subsp lactis IBB SL1 with raffinose family oligosaccharides [RFOs; S1], Lactococcus lactis subsp cremoris IBB SC1 with RFOs [S2], and Lactobacillus acidophilus and Streptococcus faecium with lactose [S3]). Control eggs were injected with RFOs prebiotic or saline (0.9% NaCl) solution. Gene expression of 6 cytokines (interleukin [IL]-4, IL-6, IL-12p40, IL-18, interferon [IFN]-beta, and IFN-gamma) and 1 chemokine (IL-8) was analyzed in the cecal tonsils and spleen of 6-week-old chickens by means of reverse transcription quantitative PCR assays. RESULTS: Gene expression for IL-4, IL-6, IFN-beta, and IL-18 was significantly upregulated in the spleen of chickens in groups S2 and S3. In contrast, IL-12 expression was downregulated in group S2 and IFN-gamma expression was downregulated in group S3. Expression of IL-8 did not change in chickens treated with synbiotics in ovo. Gene expression of all cytokines, except for IL-18, was downregulated in cecal tonsils. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In ovo administration of synbiotics activated the immune system in adult chickens. The intestinal immune system (cecal tonsils) had downregulation of expression for the cytokines evaluated, which indicated an increase in oral tolerance, whereas in the peripheral part of the immune system (spleen), expression of IL-4 and IL-6 was upregulated. Evaluation of immune-related gene expression patterns may be useful when monitoring the effectiveness of synbiotic selection with respect to immunobiotic properties.
TI  - Fermented fruits and vegetables of Asia: a potential source of probiotics.
AB  - As world population increases, lactic acid fermentation is expected to become an  important role in preserving fresh vegetables, fruits, and other food items for feeding humanity in developing countries. However, several fermented fruits and vegetables products (Sauerkraut, Kimchi, Gundruk, Khalpi, Sinki, etc.) have a long history in human nutrition from ancient ages and are associated with the several social aspects of different communities. Among the food items, fruits and vegetables are easily perishable commodities due to their high water activity and nutritive values. These conditions are more critical in tropical and subtropical countries which favour the growth of spoilage causing microorganisms. Lactic acid fermentation increases shelf life of fruits and vegetables and also enhances several beneficial properties, including nutritive value and flavours, and reduces toxicity. Fermented fruits and vegetables can be used as a potential source of probiotics as they harbour several lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus plantarum, L. pentosus, L. brevis, L. acidophilus, L. fermentum, Leuconostoc fallax, and L. mesenteroides. As a whole, the traditionally fermented fruits and vegetables not only serve as food supplements but also attribute towards health benefits. This review aims to describe some important Asian fermented fruits and vegetables and their significance as a potential source of probiotics.
TI  - Immunoregulatory effects on Caco-2 cells and mice of exopolysaccharides isolated  from Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM.
AB  - On the basis of our previous results on potential immunoregulation of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM, the immunoregulatory effects of exopolysaccharides (EPS) isolated from L. acidophilus NCFM and their regulating mechanisms are further investigated in the current research. Stimulated by EPS preparations, four immune-related genes in the human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2 cells, namely, interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha), chemokine C-C motif 2 (CCL2), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and pentraxin 3 (PTX3), first showed an increase at 2-4 h, peaked at 4 h, and then decreased at 4-12 h. Similar trends were observed in vivo: four genes showed transient expression (highest on the 4th day) in the cecum and colon of mice. Meanwhile, the organ coefficient, clearance index and phagocytic index all significantly increased with time extension and dose increase of EPS stimulation. EPS triggered NF-kappaB and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) signaling pathways in Caco-2 cells, and the activated pathways initiated the genes expression. EPS compounds from L. acidophilus NCFM may play an important role in host immunoregulation and might be applied as a new type of immunoregulatory agent in functional foods.
TI  - The antibacterial and antifungal activity of essential oils extracted from Guatemalan medicinal plants.
AB  - CONTEXT: Essential oils are prevalent in many medicinal plants used for oral hygiene and treatment of diseases. OBJECTIVE: Medicinal plant species were extracted to determine the essential oil content. Those producing sufficient oil were screened for activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Candida albicans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plant samples were collected, frozen, and essential oils were extracted by steam distillation. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined using a tube dilution assay for those species yielding sufficient oil. RESULTS: Fifty-nine of the 141 plant species produced sufficient oil for collection and 12 species not previously reported to produce essential oils were identified. Essential oil extracts from 32 species exhibited activity against one or more microbes. Oils from eight species were highly inhibitory to S. mutans, four species were highly inhibitory to C. albicans, and 19 species yielded MIC values less than the reference drugs. DISCUSSION: RESULTS suggest that 11 species were highly inhibitory to the microbes tested and merit further investigation. Oils from Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume (Lauraceae), Citrus aurantiifolia (Christm.) Swingle (Rutaceae), Lippia graveolens Kunth (Verbenaceae), and Origanum vulgare L. (Lamiaceae) yielded highly significant or moderate activity against all microbes and have potential as antimicrobial agents. CONCLUSION: Teas prepared by decoction or infusion are known methods for extracting essential oils. Oils from 11 species were highly active against the microbes tested and merit investigation as to their potential for addressing health-related issues and in oral hygiene.
TI  - Effect of inulin on the physicochemical properties, flow behavior and probiotic survival of frozen yogurt.
AB  - This study investigated the effect of inulin (0, 1 and 2 %), on some physicochemical properties of frozen yogurt, as well as its effect on flow behavior and probiotic survival. The results showed that the addition of inulin improved overrun, viscosity and melting properties significantly (p < 0.05); when added at 2 % level, it also had significant effect on pH. Total acceptability of samples revealed that frozen yogurt with 2 % inulin had the most appealing sensory characteristics. The flow behavior of all samples showed their pseudoplastic nature; power law was the best model to predict their flow behavior. In terms of probiotic survival, the sample with 2 % inulin significantly improved the viability of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis.
TI  - Effects of probiotic yogurt consumption on metabolic factors in individuals with  nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of probiotic yogurt consumption on some metabolic factors in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients. This double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial was conducted on 72 patients with NAFLD (33 males and 39 females) aged 23 to 63 yr. Subjects in the intervention group (n=36) consumed 300 g/d of probiotic yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 and those in the control group (n=36) consumed 300 g/d of conventional yogurt for 8 wk. Fasting blood samples, anthropometric measurements, and dietary records (24h/d for 3 d) were collected at baseline and at the end of the trial. Probiotic yogurt consumption resulted in reductions of 4.67, 5.42, 4.1, and 6.92% in serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, respectively, compared with control group. No significant changes were observed in levels of serum glucose, triglycerides, or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in either group. Probiotic yogurt consumption improved hepatic enzymes, serum total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in studied subjects and might be useful in management of NAFLD risk factors.
TI  - Control of cell morphology of probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus for enhanced cell stability during industrial processing.
AB  - The viability of bacteria during industrial processing is an essential quality criterion for bacterial preparations, such as probiotics and starter cultures. Therefore, producing stable microbial cultures during proliferation is of great interest. A strong correlation between the culture medium and cellular morphology was observed for the lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM, which is commonly used in the dairy industry as a probiotic supplement and as a starter culture. The cell shapes ranged from single short rods to long filamentous rods. The culture medium composition could control this phenomenon of pleomorphism, especially the use of peptone in combination with an adequate heating of the medium during preparation. Furthermore, we observed a correlation between the cell size and stability of the microorganisms during industrial processing steps, such as freeze-drying, extrusion encapsulation and storage following dried preparations. The results revealed that short cells are more stable than long cells during each of the industrially relevant processing steps. As demonstrated for L. acidophilus NCFM, the adaptation of the medium composition and optimized medium preparation offer the possibility to increase the concentration of viable cells during up- and survival rate during down-stream processing.
TI  - Therapeutic enhancement of newly derived bacteriocins against Giardia lamblia.
AB  - Trials for identifying efficient anti-giardial agents are still ongoing. Nowadays, bacteriocins have attracted the attention as potential antimicrobial compounds. For the first time, the current study evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of bacteriocins derived from newly isolated Egyptian strains of probiotics Lactobacilli; L. acidophilus (P106) and L. plantarum (P164) against Giardia lamblia. Bacteriocins' efficacy was evaluated both in vitro; by growth inhibition and adherence assays, and in vivo; through estimation of parasite density, intestinal histopathological examination and ultrastructural analysis of Giardia trophozoites. In vivo bacteriocins' clinical safety was assessed. In vitro results proved that 50 microg of L. acidophilus bacteriocin induced reduction of the mean Giardia lamblia trophozoites by 58.3 +/- 4.04%, while at lower concentrations of 10 and 20 microg of both L. acidophilus and L. plantarum, non significant reduction of the mean parasite density was achieved. In vitro trophozoites adherence was susceptible to the tested bacteriocins at all studied concentrations with variable degrees, while the highest adherence reduction was demonstrated using 50 microg of L acidophilus bacteriocin. In vivo, oral inoculation of 50 microg/mouse L. acidophilus bacteriocin for 5 successive days resulted in a noteworthy decline of the intestinal parasite density, along with amelioration of intestinal pathology of infected mice. Ultrastructural examination proved thatfive doses of L. acidophilus bacteriocin showed marked changes in cellular architecture of the trophozoites with evident disorganization of the cell membrane, adhesive disc and cytoplasmic components. This is the first reported study of the safe anti-giardial efficacy of L. acidophilus (P106) derived bacteriocin, hence highlighting its great promise as a potential therapeutic safe alternative to existing commercial drugs.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus Protected Organs in Experimental Arthritis by Regulating the Pro-inflammatory Cytokines.
AB  - Arthritis is an inflammatory disease of joints. Exact etiology of the disease is  not understood yet; but histopathological examination of vital organs like liver, kidney, ovary and knee joint can anticipate immune mediated damage. In this study, Lactobacillus acidophilus was administered orally by both prophylactic and curative protocol in freund's complete adjuvant induced arthritic rats. Indomethacin was used as standard anti-arthritic drug. Histopathology of liver, kidney, ovary and right hind knee joint were done. Cytokine concentrations were determined by using ELISA. Effects shown by L. acidophilus were comparable with indomethacin. Histopathological analysis of liver, kidney, ovaries and knee joints of L. acidophilus fed groups revealed significantly less damage as compared with other counterparts. Lactobacillus treatment has down-regulated pro-inflammatory level and up-regulated anti-inflammatory cytokines level in serum samples. L. acidophilus managed organs damage associated with arthritis. It has significantly down regulated the pro-inflammatory cytokines.
TI  - Cholesterol assimilation by Lactobacillus probiotic bacteria: an in vitro investigation.
AB  - Excess cholesterol is associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD), an important cause of mortality worldwide. Current CVD therapeutic measures, lifestyle and dietary interventions, and pharmaceutical agents for regulating cholesterol levels are inadequate. Probiotic bacteria have demonstrated potential to lower cholesterol levels by different mechanisms, including bile salt hydrolase activity, production of compounds that inhibit enzymes such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A, and cholesterol assimilation. This work investigates 11 Lactobacillus strains for cholesterol assimilation. Probiotic strains for investigation were selected from the literature: Lactobacillus reuteri NCIMB 11951, L. reuteri NCIMB 701359, L. reuteri NCIMB 702655, L. reuteri NCIMB 701089, L. reuteri NCIMB 702656, Lactobacillus fermentum NCIMB 5221, L. fermentum NCIMB 8829, L. fermentum NCIMB 2797, Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 53103 GG, Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 314, and Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC 14917. Cholesterol assimilation was investigated in culture media and under simulated intestinal conditions. The best cholesterol assimilator was L. plantarum ATCC 14917 (15.18+/-0.55 mg/10(10) cfu) in MRS broth. L. reuteri NCIMB 701089 assimilated over 67% (2254.70+/-63.33 mg/10(10) cfu) of cholesterol, the most of all the strains, under intestinal conditions. This work demonstrates that probiotic bacteria can assimilate cholesterol under intestinal conditions, with L. reuteri NCIMB 701089 showing great potential as a CVD therapeutic.
TI  - Effect of the bread-making process on zearalenone levels.
AB  - The effects of the bread-making process including fermentation with Saccharomyces cerevisiae and lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus fermentum) and baking at 200 degrees C on zearalenone (ZEA) levels were investigated. Standard solutions of ZEA were added to flour and then loaves of bread were prepared. Sourdough and three types of yeast including active dry yeast, instant dry yeast and compressed yeast were used for the fermentation of dough. ZEA levels in flour, dough and bread were determined by HPLC with fluorescence detection after extraction and clean-up on an immunoaffinity column. The highest reduction in levels of ZEA was found in the first fermentation (first proof), while the lowest reduction was observed in the baking stage. In addition, the results showed that compressed yeast had the maximum reduction potential on ZEA levels even at the baking stage.
TI  - Screening of different probiotic strains for their in vitro ability to metabolise oxalates: any prospective use in humans?
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oxalate is the salt-forming ion of oxalic acid and can generate oxalate salts combining with various cations, such as sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium. Approximately 75% of all kidney stones are composed primarily of calcium oxalate (CaOx) and hyperoxaluria, a condition involving high urinary oxalate concentration, is considered a primary risk factor for kidney stone formation, known as nephrolithiasis. Current therapeutic strategies often fail in their compliance or effectiveness, and CaOx stone recurrence is still common. After an initial stone, there is a 50% chance of forming a second stone within 7 years if the condition is left untreated. The potential therapeutic application of some probiotics, mainly lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, in reducing hyperoxaluria in vivo through intestinal oxalate degrading activity is compelling and initial reports are promising. This study was undertaken to screen different Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains for their capacity to degrade oxalate in vitro using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). METHODS: The oxalate-degrading activity of 13 lactobacilli and 5 bifidobacteria was tested using a novel HPLC method after growth in a broth culture added with 10 mM ammonium oxalate. Experiments were repeated 3 times. Oxalobacter formigenes (DSM 4420) was used as positive reference to validate HPLC oxalate-degrading capability assays. RESULTS: Lactobacillus strains were more efficient than bifidobacteria in degrading oxalates. L. paracasei LPC09 (DSM 24243) gave the best result, as 68.5% of ammonium oxalate was converted at the end of incubation, whereas the following best converters belong to the L. gasseri and L. acidophilus species. The relatively low conversion rate observed for most bifidobacteria can probably be attributed to intrinsic oxalate toxicity toward this genus. CONCLUSIONS: Humans lack the enzymes needed to directly metabolise oxalate, and this potentially toxic compound is, therefore, managed using alternative pathways. As oxalate-degrading bacteria are present in the endogenous microbiota of the human intestine, although with significant individual differences, it is possible to hypothesise that the administration of selected oxalate-degrading probiotics could be an alternative and innovative approach to reducing the intestinal absorption of oxalate and the resulting urinary excretion.
TI  - Can Lactobacillus fermentum LF10 and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA02 in a slow-release vaginal product be useful for prevention of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis?: A clinical study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of the association of 2 specific strains,  Lactobacillus fermentum LF10 (DSM 19187) and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA02 (DSM 21717), specifically formulated in slow-release effervescent tablets, in patients with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis. STUDY DESIGN: The study was a clinical trial of 58 women diagnosed with recurrent VVC (>/=4 culture-confirmed episodes in a 12-mo period). All patients were given 200 mg of fluconazole orally as an induction dose for 3 alternate days during the first treatment week. Afterward, the patients were given a new product formulated in slow-release vaginal tablets containing at least 0.4 billion live cells of each of lactobacillus L. fermentum LF10 and L. acidophilus LA02 (first phase of the prophylactic period), on alternate days for 10 consecutive nights. Patients who were still free of symptoms were given 1 vaginal tablet every week for the next 10 weeks (second phase of the prophylactic period). Patients asymptomatic after the total duration of the observation phase (7 mo) were considered as responders. RESULTS: During the second 10-week prophylactic phase, 49 of 57 (86.0%) patients remained free of clinical recurrence, whereas symptomatic VVC occurred in 8 patients (14.0%). During the 7-month follow-up, 42 patients of 49 (85.7%) were symptom free at the end of the protocol, whereas clinical recurrences occurred in 7 women (14.3%). Overall, 42 of 58 women enrolled in the study (72.4%) experienced no clinical recurrence throughout the 7-month observation phase (responders). CONCLUSIONS: This study strengthens the evidence supporting the use of specific lactobacilli with well-demonstrated activities associated with the creation and maintenance of a vaginal biofilm that hinders the persistence of an infection caused by Candida.
TI  - Eruca sativa might influence the growth, survival under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and some biological features of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains.
AB  - The growth and viability of three Lactobacillus strains, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus rhamnosus, after their passage through simulated gastric and pancreatic juices were studied as a function of their presence in the growth medium of rocket salad (Eruca sativa). The presence of E. sativa affected some of the biological properties of the strains. For example, L. acidophilus and L. plantarum worked more efficiently in the presence of E. sativa, increasing not only the antioxidant activity of the medium, but also their own antioxidant power and antimicrobial activity; L. rhamnosus was not affected in the same manner. Overall, the presence of vegetables might help to boost, in specific cases, some of the characteristics of lactobacilli, including antioxidant and antimicrobial power.
TI  - Characteristic odor components of volatile oil from the cultivation medium of Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Volatile oils obtained from both the liquid medium after incubation (MAI) and liquid medium before incubation (MBI) in the cultivation process of Lactobacillus acidophilus were isolated by hydrodistillation (HD) and analyzed to investigate the utility of the liquid waste. The composition of the volatile oils was analyzed by capillary gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In total, 46 and 19 compounds were detected in the volatile oils from MAI (MAI oil) and MBI (MBI oil), respectively. The principle components of MAI oil were fatty acids, including pentanoic acid (12.75%), heptanoic acid (14.05%), and nonanoic acid (14.04%). The important aroma-active compounds in the oils were detected by GC-MS/Olfactometry (GC-O), and their intensity of aroma were measured by aroma extraction dilution analysis (AEDA). Pyrazines were determined as key aroma components; in particular, 2-ethyl-5-methylpyrazine was the most primary aroma-active compound in MAI oil. In addition, as the characteristic aroma-active compounds, 3-(methylthio)-propanal, trimethylpyrazine, and pentanoic acid were also detected in MAI oil. These results imply that the waste medium after incubation of L. acidophilus may be utilized as a source of volatile oils.
TI  - Vaginal suppositories containing Lactobacillus acidophilus: development and characterization.
AB  - Abstract Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and characterize suppositories for vaginal delivery of Lactobacillus acidophilus. Methods: Formulations were performed in order to select suitable excipients based on suppository formation feasibility and cytotoxicity. Solid body and hollow-type suppositories were prepared by melting and molding using poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) 400 and 4000 or Witepsol (WIT) H12 as excipients. L. acidophilus was incorporated in the molten mass before molding solid body suppositories or added as suspension into the cavity of hollow-type suppositories and sealed molten excipients. Cytotoxicity of the selected excipients was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetr azolium and lactate dehydrogenase assays against VK2/E6E7, HEC-1-A and HeLa cells. Suppositories were characterized regarding organoleptic characteristics, mass uniformity, disintegration, breaking strength and L. acidophilus in vitro release. Results: PEG 400, PEG 4000 and WIT H12 showed the absence of toxicity when tested using three different vaginal cell lines. Obtained vaginal suppositories presented uniform and mild texture, a content of about 1 x 108 colony-forming units, completely disintegrated in simulated vaginal environment in less than 60 min and provided sustained in vitro release of L. acidophilus. Release studies further demonstrated that incorporation of freeze-dried bacteria did not result in significant loss of viable bacteria, thus supporting that vaginal suppositories may possess good properties to promote the replacement of the vaginal flora in situations of urinary tract infection. Conclusion: Hollow-type suppositories showed to be promising delivery vehicles for vaginal delivery of probiotics.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 prevents atherosclerosis via inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption in apolipoprotein E-knockout mice.
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 on the development of atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-knockout (ApoE(-/-)) mice. Eight-week-old ApoE(-/-) mice were fed a Western diet with or without L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 daily for 16 weeks. L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 protected ApoE(-/-) mice from atherosclerosis by reducing their plasma cholesterol levels from 923 +/- 44 to 581 +/- 18 mg/dl, likely via a marked decrease in cholesterol absorption caused by modulation of Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1). In addition, suppression of cholesterol absorption induced reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) in macrophages through the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor/liver X receptor (PPAR/LXR) pathway. Fecal lactobacillus and bifidobacterium counts were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 treatment groups than in the control groups. Furthermore, L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 was detected in the rat small intestine, colon, and feces during the feeding trial. The bacterial levels remained high even after the administration of lactic acid bacteria had been stopped for 2 weeks. These results suggest that administration of L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 can protect against atherosclerosis through the inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption. Therefore, L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 may be a potential therapeutic material for preventing the progression of atherosclerosis.
TI  - Recovery and purification of oligosaccharides from copra meal by recombinant endo-beta-mannanase and deciphering molecular mechanism involved and its role as potent therapeutic agent.
AB  - Production of manno-oligosaccharides (MOSs) from pretreated and defatted copra meal (dFCO) hydrolysis was achieved by endo-mannanase. Structural characterization of dFCO by FT-IR and NMR exhibited resemblance with galactomannan. The time-dependent hydrolysis of dFCO by recombinant endo-beta-(1 --> 4)-mannanase of Clostridium thermocellum by TLC and HPAEC displayed the release of mannose and MOSs mannobiose and mannotriose. Purified MOSs yielded 40 % mannobiose and 18 % mannotriose confirmed by mass spectroscopy which showed mannobiose (m/z = 365) and mannotriose (m/z = 527). The homology based structural analysis of catalytic endo-mannanase (CtManT) showed the catalytic core composed of Glu181 and Glu300 acting as acid/base and Glu288 as a nucleophile during galactomannan hydrolysis. Sub-site mapping of CtManT exhibited two aglycone and four glycone sites at cleavage sites existing on either side of beta-(1 --> 4)-linkage of galactomannan. Isolated MOSs displayed potential prebiotic characteristics and supported higher growth of probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium infantis than with standard inulin. Moreover, MOSs displayed over 97 % tolerance to simulated gastric juice, intestinal fluid, and alpha-amylase proving its potential as a stable prebiotic over inulin. In vitro cytotoxicity assay of MOSs (500 microg/mL) on human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line (HT-29) demonstrated 60 % decreased viability of cells after 48 h displaying anti-tumorigenic property.
TI  - Role of a medical device for intra-vaginal use in improving the quality of the colposcopic examination and the anatomical/pathological reading of the cytological test and biopsy.
AB  - To evaluate the efficacy of a vaginal suppository in overcoming unsatisfactory colposcopy and/or possible change in terms of diagnosis in women who have had abnormal cervical cytology, 98 females were enrolled and treated for 10 days with Kramegin(R), a vaginal product in tablets containing Lactobacillus acidophilus, lactic acid and Krameria triandra extract. Seventy-eight of 98 females completed the study. Seventy-fife of 78 volunteers served for the statistical analysis. According to the results got, diagnoses were modified in almost 62% of cases; cervical conization was reduced in 58% of cases; regression for HSIL (to LSIL) was 35% higher than expected; need of follow-up decreased by 36% and treatment was well tolerated in about 96% of cases. Use of Kramegin(R) before colposcopy can be considered a good tool to increase the possibility of turning unsatisfactory colposcopy into satisfactory and seems to indicate a possible role in reducing cervical lesion progression. Deeper clinical investigations are mandatory to confirm this possible result.
TI  - Short-term probiotic therapy alleviates small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, but does not improve intestinal permeability in chronic liver disease.
AB  - AIM: : Although numerous animal studies suggest that probiotic therapy has beneficial effects in various liver diseases, the evidence for beneficial effects in human liver disease is controversial. This study was carried out to investigate the efficacy of probiotic therapy in alleviating small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and permeability in chronic liver disease. METHODS: Fifty-three patients with chronic liver disease were randomized to either probiotic therapy or placebo. Six bacterial species were used: Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium lactis, Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. After 4 weeks, changes in the composition of fecal bacteria, SIBO, intestinal permeability, and clinical symptoms were examined. RESULTS: Three of the six probiotic species, B. lactis, L. rhamnosus, and L. acidophilus, increased in the feces of the probiotic therapy group (P<0.001), whereas there was no change in fecal microbiota in the placebo group. SIBO disappeared in many individuals of the probiotic therapy group, but none in the placebo (24 vs. 0%, P<0.05). General gastrointestinal symptoms also improved more in the probiotic group and improvement in intestinal permeability was slightly but not significantly more frequent in the probiotic arm than the placebo arm (50 vs. 31.3%, P=0.248). Numbers of lactobacilli in stool were correlated negatively with intestinal permeability (P for trend<0.05). Liver chemistry did not improve significantly in either group. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that short-term probiotic administration in chronic liver disease is effective in alleviating SIBO and clinical symptoms, but ineffective in improving intestinal permeability and liver function.
TI  - Spermicidal and contraceptive potential of desgalactotigonin: a prospective alternative of nonoxynol-9.
AB  - Crude decoction of Chenopodium album seed showed spermicidal effect at MIC 2 mg/ml in earlier studies. Systematic isolation, characterization and evaluation revealed that the major metabolite Desgalactotigonin (DGT) is the most effective principle in both in vitro and in vivo studies. The in vitro studies comprises (a) rat and human sperm motility and immobilizing activity by Sander-Cramer assay; (b) sperm membrane integrity was observed by HOS test and electron microscopy; (c) microbial potential was examined in Lactobacillus broth culture, and (d) the hemolytic index was determined by using rat RBCs. The in vivo contraceptive efficacy was evaluated by intra uterine application of DGT in rat. Lipid peroxidation and induction of apoptosis by DGT on human spermatozoa were also studied. The minimum effective concentration (MEC) of DGT that induced instantaneous immobilization in vitro was 24.18 microM for rat and 58.03 microM for human spermatozoa. Microbial study indicated DGT to be friendly to Lactobacillus acidophilus. Implantation was prevented in DGT treated uterine horn while no hindrance occurred in the untreated contra lateral side. At the level of EC50, DGT induced apoptosis in human spermatozoa as determined by increased labeling with Annexin-V and decreased polarization of sperm mitochondria. Desgalactotigonin emerged 80 and 2x10(4) times more potent than the decoction and Nonoxynol-9 respectively. It possesses mechanism based detrimental action on both human and rat spermatozoa and spares lactobacilli and HeLa cells at MEC which proves its potential as a superior ingredient for the formulation of a contraceptive safer/compatible to vaginal microflora.
TI  - Screening, isolation and identification of Probiotic producing lactobacillus acidophilus strains EMBS081 & EMBS082 by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
AB  - 16S rDNA sequencing which has gained wide popularity amongst microbiologists for  the molecular characterization and identification of newly discovered isolates provides accurate identification of isolates down to the level of sub-species (strain). It's most important advantage over the traditional biochemical characterization methods are that it can provide an accurate identification of strains with atypical phenotypic characters as well. The following work is an application of 16S rRNA gene sequencing approach to identify a novel species of Probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus. The sample was collected from pond water samples of rural and urban areas of Krishna District, Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, India. Subsequently the sample was serially diluted and the aliquots were incubated for a suitable time period following which the suspected colony was subjected to 16S rDNA sequencing. The sequence aligned against other species were concluded to be a novel, Probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus bacteria, further which were named Lactobacillus acidophilus strain EMBS081 & EMBS082. After the sequence characterization, the isolate was deposited in GenBank Database, maintained by the National Centre for Biotechnology Information NCBI. The sequence can also be retrieve from EMBL and DDBJ repositories with accession numbers JX255677 and KC150145.
TI  - Effect of aqueous and alcoholic licorice (glycyrrhiza glabra) root extract against streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus acidophilus in comparison to chlorhexidine: an in vitro study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glycyrrhiza (licorice) an herb, which has medicinal value and was used in ancient times as a remedy for a great diversity of ailments and sweetener. Roots of Glycyrrhiza contain a high concentration of saponin and glycyrrhizin, which are supposed to be sweetening agents. The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy of aqueous and alcoholic licorice root extract against Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus in comparison to chlorhexidine (CHX). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the first part of the study, various concentrations of aqueous and ethanolic licorice extract were prepared in the laboratory of Pharmacy College. It was then subjected to microbiological assay to determine its zone of inhibition using agar disk diffusion test and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) using serial broth dilution method against S. mutans and L. acidophilus. CHX was used as a positive control. RESULTS: MIC of aqueous and ethnolic licorice root extract against S. mutans and L. acidophilus were 25% and 12.5%, respectively. Mean zone of inhibition of the aqueous and alcoholic licorice extracts against S. mutans at 48 h were 22.8 mm and 26.7 mm, respectively. Mean zone of inhibition of the aqueous and alcoholic licorice extracts against L. acidophilus at 48 h were 14.4 mm and 15.1 mm, respectively. Mean zone of inhibition of the CHX against S. mutans and L. acidophilus at 48 h was 20.5 and 13.2, respectively. CONCLUSION: The inhibitory effect shown by alcoholic licorice root extract against S. mutans and L. acidophilus was superior when compared with that of aqueous form and CHX.
TI  - Influence of a probiotic mixture on antibiotic induced microbiota disturbances.
AB  - AIM: To study the effect of probiotic consumption on the faecal microbiota during and after antibiotic exposure. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study with a two species probiotic combination [Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) ATCC 700396 and Bifidobacterium lactis (B. lactis) ATCC SD5220] on healthy adults during and after antibiotic treatment (amoxicillin 875 and 125 mg clavulanate). The dominant faecal microbiota was studied by real time-polymerase chain reaction to determine if this probiotic preparation could facilitate restoring the microbiota to its pre-antibiotic state and influence the prevalence of beta-lactam resistance. Gastrointestinal symptoms were recorded by questionnaire and Bristol stool scale. RESULTS: Subjects on the probiotic combination had significantly higher faecal counts of L. acidophilus ATCC 700396 and B. lactis at day 8 (end of antibiotic treatment period) vs those on placebo. Furthermore, subjects on the probiotic combination had significantly higher faecal counts of L. acidophilus ATCC 700396 and B. lactis at Day 15 (end of probiotic treatment) vs those on placebo. Lactobacillus counts remained stable in the probiotic group over the course of the study, while Clostridium XIV group was higher at the end of the study and closer to baseline levels; this in contrast to the placebo group. Beta-lactam resistance in creased after antibiotic exposure and was not different between both treatment groups. Gastrointestinal symptoms were generally mild and did not differ between the treatment groups, which correlates with the generally small changes in the microbiota. CONCLUSION: Consumption of the probiotic combination mainly leads to an increase in the faecal levels of the species included in the preparation.
TI  - Probiotics and vitamin C for the prevention of respiratory tract infections in children attending preschool: a randomised controlled pilot study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This pilot study investigates the efficacy of a probiotic consortium  (Lab4) in combination with vitamin C on the prevention of respiratory tract infections in children attending preschool facilities. SUBJECTS/METHODS: In a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled pilot study with children aged 3-6 years, 57 received 1.25 x 10(10) colony-forming units of Lactobacillus acidophilus CUL21 (NCIMB 30156), Lactobacillus acidophilus CUL60 (NCIMB 30157), Bifidobacterium bifidum CUL20 (NCIMB 30153) and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis CUL34 (NCIMB 30172) plus 50 mg vitamin C or a placebo daily for 6 months. RESULTS: Significant reductions in the incidence rate of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI; 33%, P=0.002), the number of days with URTI symptoms (mean difference: -21.0, 95% confidence interval (CI):-35.9, -6.0, P=0.006) and the incidence rate of absence from preschool (30%, P=0.007) were observed in the active group compared with the placebo. The number of days of use of antibiotics, painkillers, cough medicine or nasal sprays was lower in the active group and reached significance for use of cough medicine (mean difference: -6.6, 95% CI: -12.9, -0.3, P=0.040). No significant differences were observed in the incidence rate ratio or duration of lower respiratory tract infection or in the levels of plasma cytokines, salivary immunoglobulin A or urinary metabolites. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation with a probiotic/vitamin C combination may be beneficial in the prevention and management of URTIs.
TI  - Effects of probiotic yogurt consumption on lipid profile in type 2 diabetic patients: A randomized controlled clinical trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alteration in plasma lipid and lipoprotein profile has been documented in diabetic patients. The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of probiotic and conventional yogurt on lipid profile in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 44 patients with type 2 diabetes aged 30-60 years old who had low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) >/=100 mg/dl enrolled in this randomized, double - blind controlled trial and were assigned to two intervention and control groups. The subjects in the intervention group consumed 300 g/d probiotic yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb-12 and subjects in the control group consumed 300 g/d conventional yogurt for 8 weeks. Anthropometric indices, dietary intake, and serum lipid profile were evaluated at the beginning and end of the intervention. Independent-sample t-test, paired sample t-test, ANCOVA, and repeated measures were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The consumption of probiotic yogurt caused significant decrease in LDL-c/high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) ratio (3.13 +/- 1.00-2.07 +/- 0.71, P = 0.016). The levels of HDL-c were increased significantly (43.66 +/- 6.80-50.42 +/- 6.64, P = 0.023) in the intervention group postintervention. However, there were no significant differences in triglyceride and total cholesterol levels between two groups postintervention (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: It is suggested that probiotic yogurt consumption may be used as an alternative prevention approach and treatment method to improve dyslipidemia in patients with type 2 diabetes.
TI  - [Correlation of the microbiota and intestinal mucosa in the pathophysiology and treatment of irritable bowel, irritable eye, and irritable mind syndrome].
AB  - Accumulating clinical evidence supports co-morbidity of irritable bowel, irritable eye and irritable mind symptoms. Furthermore, perturbation of the microbiota-host symbiosis (dysbiosis) is considered a common pathogenic mechanism connecting gastrointestinal, ocular and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Consequently, maintaining or restoring microbiota-host symbiosis represents a new approach to treat these symptoms or to prevent their relapses. Current treatment approach assigned a primary role to live probiotics alone or in combination with prebiotics to enhance colonization of beneficial bacteria and to strengthen the symbiosis. However, several papers showed major benefits of heat-killed probiotics as compared to their live counterparts on both intestinal and systemic symptoms. Recently, in addition to killing probiotics, in a proof of concept study lysates (fragments) of probiotics in combination with vitamins A, B, D and omega 3 fatty acids were successfully tested. These findings suggested a conceptual change in the approach addressed to both the microbiota and host as targets for intervention.
TI  - Prebiotic activity score and bioactive compounds in longan (Dimocarpus longan Lour.): influence of pectinase in enzyme-assisted extraction.
AB  - The optimal extraction of bioactive compounds from longan fruit pulp using Pectinex(R) Ultra SP-L pectinase hydrolysis of the fruit homogenate was evaluated. The highest degree of hydrolysis (DH), as determined by the amount of reducing sugars released from the longan pulp, was obtained at a pectinase concentration of 2.5 % (v/w) (257 polygalacturonase units/g fruit) for 4 h. The level of bioactive compounds obtained from the pectinase-treated longan pulp increased with increasing DH to a maximum at the highest DH (21 %) obtained, with an antioxidant activity of 0.083 EC50 mug fresh mass (FM)/mug diphenyl-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)iminoazanium and 92.7 muM Trolox equivalent/g FM, respectively. The total phenolic and flavonoid contents in the 21 % DH extract were 196.0 mg gallic acid equivalents/g FM and 19.6 mg catechin equivalents/g FM, respectively. The 21 % DH longan extract showed an enhanced (3.6- to 4.0-fold) inhibition of lipid peroxidation of oil compared to the untreated (0 % DH) extract. In addition, the 21 % DH longan extract had the highest soluble dietary fiber content, which was related to the decreased particle size of 345 muM, and displayed enhanced prebiotic activity scores of 1.69 and 1.44 for Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 and Bifidabacterium lactis Bb12, respectively. Most of the 33 detected volatile compounds differed in their relative proportions after enzymic extraction (15 increased, 15 decreased with three showing no significant change) with the 0 % and 21 % DH hydrolysates exhibiting 25 and 22 different volatile compounds, respectively, with 11 and eight unique compounds between them, respectively.
TI  - From deep sequencing to actual clones.
AB  - The application of deep sequencing to in vitro display technologies has been invaluable for the straightforward analysis of enriched clones. After sequencing in vitro selected populations, clones are binned into identical or similar groups and ordered by abundance, allowing identification of those that are most enriched. However, the greatest strength of deep sequencing is also its greatest weakness: clones are easily identified by their DNA sequences, but are not physically available for testing without a laborious multistep process involving several rounds of polymerization chain reaction (PCR), assembly and cloning. Here, using the isolation of antibody genes from a phage and yeast display selection as an example, we show the power of a rapid and simple inverse PCR-based method to easily isolate clones identified by deep sequencing. Once primers have been received, clone isolation can be carried out in a single day, rather than two days. Furthermore the reduced number of PCRs required will reduce PCR mutations correspondingly. We have observed a 100% success rate in amplifying clones with an abundance as low as 0.5% in a polyclonal population. This approach allows us to obtain full-length clones even when an incomplete sequence is available, and greatly simplifies the subcloning process. Moreover, rarer, but functional clones missed by traditional screening can be easily isolated using this method, and the approach can be extended to any selected library (scFv, cDNA, libraries based on scaffold proteins) where a unique sequence signature for the desired clones of interest is available.
TI  - Effect of Lactobacillus species on Streptococcus mutans biofilm formation.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans is the primary pathogen responsible for initiating dental caries and decay. The presence of sucrose, stimulates S. mutans to produce insoluble glucans to form oral biofilm also known as dental plaque to initiate caries lesion. The GtfB and LuxS genes of S. mutans are responsible for formation and maturation of biofilm. Lactobacillus species as probiotic can reduces the count of S. mutans. In this study effect of different Lactobacillus species against the formation of S. mutans biofilm was observed. Growing biofilm in the presence of sucrose was detected using 96 well microtiter plate crystal violet assay and biofilm formation by S. mutans in the presence of Lactobacillus was detected. Gene expression of biofilm forming genes (GtfB and LuxS) was quantified through Real-time PCR. All strains of Lactobacillus potently reduced the formation of S. mutans biofilm whereas Lactobacillus acidophilus reduced the genetic expression by 60-80%. Therefore, probiotic Lactobacillus species can be used as an alternative instead of antibiotics to decrease the chance of dental caries by reducing the count of S. mutans and their gene expression to maintain good oral health.
TI  - The effect of yoghurt and its probiotics on blood pressure and serum lipid profile; a randomised controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Despite strong mechanistic data, and promising results from  in vitro and animal studies, the ability of probiotic bacteria to improve blood pressure and serum lipid concentrations in humans remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis Bb12, provided in either yoghurt or capsule form, on home blood pressure and serum lipid profile. METHODS AND RESULTS: Following a 3-week washout period, 156 overweight men and women over 55 y were randomized to a 6-week double-blinded, factorial, parallel study. The four intervention groups were: A) probiotic yoghurt plus probiotic capsules; B) probiotic yoghurt plus placebo capsules; C) control milk plus probiotic capsules; and D) control milk plus placebo capsules. Each probiotic test article provided a minimum L. acidophilus La5 and B. animalis subsp. lactis Bb12 dose of 3.0 x 10(9) CFU/d. Home blood pressure monitoring, consisting of 7-day bi-daily repeat measurements, were collected at baseline and week 6. Fasting total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), and serum triglyceride were performed at baseline and week 6. When compared to control milk, probiotic yoghurt did not significantly alter blood pressure, heart rate or serum lipid concentrations (P > 0.05). Similarly, when compared to placebo capsules, supplementation with probiotic capsules did not alter blood pressure or concentrations of total cholesterol LDLC, HDLC, or triglycerides (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The probiotic strains L. acidophilus La5 and B. animalis subsp. lactis Bb12 did not improve cardiovascular risk factors.
TI  - Safety and protective effectiveness of two strains of Lactobacillus with probiotic features in an experimental model of salmonellosis.
AB  - Two strains of Lactobacillus, previously isolated from bovine faeces and tested in vitro for properties desired in probiotics, were evaluated for their in vivo effectiveness in protecting against experimental salmonellosis. L. salivarius L38 and L. acidophilus L36 previously demonstrated the ability to successfully colonize the gastrointestinal tract of germ-free mice and stimulate the immune system associated with the intestinal mucosa. L38- or L36-feeding showed no detrimental effect on the general health indicators and did not induce changes in normal architecture of liver and small intestine, indicating that the use of these strains is apparently safe. In control animals fed L38 strain, several cytokines had augmented mRNA levels that can be associated with a homeostatic state of intestinal mucosa, while L36 had less diverse regulation. IgA production and secretion in the intestinal lumen induced by infection was abrogated by pretreating with both lactobacilli. In addition, liver and small intestine histological scores and, translocation of Salmonella cells to liver and spleen, indicated that these strains did not confer protection against the infection. So, the IL-12:IL-18aIFN-g axis, essential for an effective immune response against Salmonella, was not favored with L38 or L36 strains. However, increased expression of IL-10 in different portions of the gastrointestinal tract of L38-fed animals is indicative of anti-inflammatory effect to be explored furthermore.
TI  - Genotyping by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA of bacteriocin producing Lactobacillus acidophilus strains from Nigeria.
AB  - Yogurt and starter culture producers are still searching strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus to produce healthier yogurt with a longer shelf life and better texture, taste, and quality. This study determined the genotyping of bacteriocin producing Lactobacillus acidophilus strains recovered from Nigerian yogurts. Yogurt samples were collected from four different states of South West regions of Nigeria. Isolates were obtained from MRS Medium and biochemically characterized. This was further confirmed by API50CH. The bacteriocin positivity and activity was determined. Genomic characterization of our Lactobacillus acidophilus strains was done with randomly amplified polymorphic DNA-PCR. All yogurt samples containing Lactobacillus acidophilus strains meet the probiotic requirement of >/=10(6) cfu/mL. The gel picture revealed 6 RAPD clonal types of Lactobacillus acidophilus strains with RAPD type C observed to be more common. Significant differences existed in the mean growth inhibition zone (t = -7.32, P < 0.05 for E. coli ATCC; t = -6.19, P < 0.05 for E. coli clinical isolates; t = -6.16, P < 0.05 for Enterobacter sp; t = -11.92, P < 0.05 for Salmonella typhi, t = -1.10, P > 0.05 Staphylococcus aureus). No correlation between the bacteriocin production, activity, and their RAPD clonal division (X(2) = 7.49, P = 0.1610, df = 5). In conclusion, L. acidophilus isolated in Nigeria samples met the probiotic requirements of >/=10(6) cfu/mL and produce bacteriocins with good spectrum of activity.
TI  - Short communication: Viability of culture organisms in honey-enriched acidophilus-bifidus-thermophilus (ABT)-type fermented camel milk.
AB  - The aim of this research was to monitor the survival during refrigerated storage  of Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 (A), Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis BB-12 (B), and Streptococcus thermophilus CHCC 742/2130 (T) in cultured dairy foods made from camel and, for comparison, cow milks supplemented with black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) honey and fermented by an acidophilus-bifidus-thermophilus (ABT)-type culture. Two liters of dromedary camel milk and 2 L of cow milk were heated to 90 degrees C and held for 10 min, then cooled to 40 degrees C. One half of both types of milk was fortified with black locust honey at the rate of 5.0% (wt/vol), whereas the other half was devoid of honey and served as a control. The camel and cow milks with and without honey were subsequently inoculated with ABT-5 culture and were fermented at 37 degrees C until a pH value of 4.6 was reached. Thereafter, the probiotic fermented milks were cooled to 15 degrees C in ice water and were each separated into 18 fractions that were transferred in sterile, tightly capped centrifuge tubes. After 24 h of cooling at 8 degrees C (d 0), the samples were stored at refrigeration temperature (4 degrees C). Three tubes of all 4 products (i.e., fermented camel and cow milks with and without honey) were taken at each sampling time (i.e., following 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 d of storage), and the counts of characteristic microorganisms and those of certain spoilage microbes (yeasts, molds, coliforms, Escherichia coli) were enumerated. The entire experimental program was repeated twice. The results showed that addition of black locust honey at 5% to heat-treated camel and cow milks did not influence the growth and survival of starter streptococci during production and subsequent refrigerated storage of fermented ABT milks. In contrast, honey improved retention of viability of B. animalis ssp. lactis BB-12 in the camel milk-based product during storage at 4 degrees C up to 5 wk. No spoilage organisms were detected in any of the samples tested in this study. In conclusion, supplementation of cultured dairy foods, especially those made from camel milk, with honey is recommended because honey is a healthy natural sweetener with a variety of beneficial microbiological, nutritional, and sensory properties.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of Hwang-Ryun-Hae-Dok-Tang on cytochrome P450 in human liver microsomes.
AB  - 1. The herb-drug interaction potential of Hwang-Ryun-Hae-Dok-Tang (HR) extracts mediated by cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibition was determined using human liver microsomes. 2. HR strongly inhibited CYP1A2 and moderately inhibited CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 (testosterone) but not CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 (midazolam). 3. The enzyme kinetic results suggest that CYP1A2 inhibition is competitively reversible (Ki, 13.4+/-1.8 mug/ml), and CYP2D6 inhibition is quasi-irreversible (KI, 0.234+/-0.138 mug/ml; kinact, 0.067+/-0.006 min(-1)). 4. Fermentation using Lactobacillus acidophilus attenuated the HR-induced inhibition of CYP2D6, but not the other isoforms. 5. Neither CYP1A2 nor CYP3A4 was markedly inhibited by berberine, palmatine, and geniposide-major components in HR-and CYP2D6 was inhibited by berberine (IC50, 13.8 mug/ml) in a metabolism-dependent manner. 6. The results suggest the possibility of HR-drug interaction through inhibition of CYP-particularly CYP2D6-which may be attenuated by fermentation using L. acidophilus.
TI  - Probiotic Bifidobacterium species stimulate human SLC26A3 gene function and expression in intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  - SLC26A3, or downregulated in adenoma (DRA), plays a major role in mediating Cl(-) absorption in the mammalian intestine. Disturbances in DRA function and expression have been implicated in intestinal disorders such as congenital Cl(-) diarrhea and gut inflammation. We previously showed that an increase in DRA function and expression by Lactobacillus acidophilus and its culture supernatant (CS) might underlie antidiarrheal effects of this probiotic strain. However, the effects of Bifidobacterium species, important inhabitants of the human colon, on intestinal Cl(-)/HCO3 (-) exchange activity are not known. Our current results demonstrate that CS derived from Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium infantis, and Bifidobacterium bifidum increased anion exchange activity in Caco-2 cells ( approximately 1.8- to 2.4-fold). Consistent with the increase in DRA function, CS also increased the protein, as well as the mRNA, level of DRA (but not putative anion transporter 1). CS of all three Bifidobacterium sp. increased DRA promoter activity (-1,183/+114 bp) in Caco-2 cells (1.5- to 1.8-fold). Furthermore, the increase in DRA mRNA expression by CS of B. breve and B. infantis was blocked in the presence of the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D (5 muM) and the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway inhibitor U0126 (10 muM). Administration of live B. breve, B. infantis, and B. bifidum by oral gavage to mice for 24 h increased DRA mRNA and protein levels in the colon. These data demonstrate an upregulation of DRA via activation of the ERK1/2 pathway that may underlie potential antidiarrheal effects of Bifidobacterium sp.
TI  - A multispecies probiotic reduces oral Candida colonization in denture wearers.
AB  - PURPOSE: The prevalence of Candida infections has been rising with an increasingly aging population and a larger population of immunocompromised individuals. The use of probiotics may be an alternative approach to antifungal agents in the prevention and treatment of oral candidiasis. This study aimed to evaluate the short-term effect of probiotics in reducing the infection level of oral Candida in candidiasis-asymptomatic elderly denture wearers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a double-blind randomized study, 59 denture wearers harboring Candida spp. in the oral cavity with no clinical symptoms were allocated into two groups: probiotic and placebo. All patients were instructed to clean the denture daily. The probiotic group poured a capsule containing lyophilized Lactobacillus rhamnosus HS111, Lactobacillus acidophillus HS101, and Bifidobacterium bifidum daily on the palatal surface of the maxillary denture, whereas the placebo group was submitted to the same regimen using placebo capsules. Candida spp. infection levels were evaluated in palate mucosa samples obtained before and after a 5-week experimental period. RESULTS: All patients harbored Candida in the palate mucosa at baseline. Fifty-five individuals completed the experimental period. The detection rate of Candida spp. was 92.0% in the placebo group after the experimental period, whereas it was reduced to 16.7% in the probiotic group. The reduction promoted by the probiotic regimen was independent of baseline characteristics such as Candida infection level and colonizing species, age of denture, and other variables. CONCLUSION: The probiotic product was effective in reducing the colonization of the oral cavity with Candida in candidiasis-asymptomatic elderly denture wearers, suggesting that this multispecies probiotic could be used to prevent oral candidiasis. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Colonization of oral surfaces by Candida is considered a risk factor for invasive fungal infections. The use of a product with L. rhamnosus, L. acidophilus, and B. bifidum may represent an alternative treatment for reduction of Candida infections in elderly denture wearers.
TI  - Addition of silver nanoparticles to composite resin: effect on physical and bactericidal properties in vitro.
AB  - The objectives of this study were to evaluate physical properties and antibacterial activity of a light-activated composite modified with silver nanoparticles. Discs were produced with unmodified resin (control group - CG) and modified resin with silver nanoparticles at two concentrations, 0.3% wt (MR03) and 0.6% wt (MR06). Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus biofilms were induced in vitro by incubation of discs in a 20% sucrose medium, followed by sonication and counting of viable cells after 1, 4 and 7 days (n=9). The arithmetic roughness of all three groups was evaluated by atomic force microscopy (n=9). Compression assay was conducted in all groups to measure the compressive strength at failure and elasticity modulus (n=5). Data were subjected to ANOVA and Tukey's tests (alpha=0.05%). At all three time points the number of viable cells was statistically lower for MR03 and MR06 compared with CG, for both specimens. MR03 and MR06 showed no significant differences. Microscopic analysis demonstrated no significant differences for roughness among the three groups (p>0.05). The MR03 was stronger to compression than CG, and MR06 was statistically lower than CG and MR03. It was concluded that the MR03 were less conducive to biofilm growth, without compromising the strength in compression and surface roughness.
TI  - Adjuvant effects of L. acidophilus LW1 on immune responses to the foot-and-mouth  disease virus DNA vaccine in mice.
AB  - The adjuvant effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus on DNA vaccination are not fully understood. It has been hypothesized that swine-derived Lactobacillus acidophilus SW1 (LASW1) could function as an immune adjuvant to enhance antigen-specific immune responses after foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) DNA vaccination in mice. To evaluate the effect of oral LASW1 on the immune response to a DNA vaccine (pRC/CMV-vp1) harboring FMD VP1 gene, anti-FMDV antibody and its isotypes, T-cell proliferation, and cytokine detection were investigated. The results showed that LASW1 was able to enhance FMDV-specific antibody levels and FMDV-neutralizing antibodies. After a booster vaccine, the anti-FMDV antibody titers and FMDV-neutralizing antibodies levels induced by pRC/CMV-vp1 were higher in mice treated with LSAW1 than in the group immunized with pRC/CMV-vp1 alone (the control). Using T-cell proliferation, the stimulation index of the LASW1 group was significantly higher in response to ConA and 146S antigen (P<0.05) than in the control group. Importantly, higher concentrations of IFN-gamma and IFN-gamma-producing cells were also observed in splenocytes isolated from the experimental LASW1 mice, indicating that INF-gamma secretion is important to the immune response to LASW1. The results indicate that LASW1 is a promising immune adjuvant in DNA vaccination against FMD when administrated orally.
TI  - Synbiotic yogurt-ice cream produced via incorporation of microencapsulated lactobacillus acidophilus (la-5) and fructooligosaccharide.
AB  - Yogurt-ice cream is a nutritious product with a refreshing taste and durability profoundly longer than that of yogurt. The probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus (La-5) cells either in free or encapsulated form were incorporated into yog-ice cream and their survivability were studied. Fructooligosaccharide (FOS) as a prebiotic compound at three levels (0, 4 & 8 % w/w) was added to yogurt-ice cream mix and its effects on some chemical properties, overrun and firmness of product were evaluated. The higher the incorporated FOS concentration, the lower were the pH value and higher the total solid content of treatments. FOS incorporation (8 %) significantly increased the overrun of treatments and reduced their firmness. The viable counts of free probiotics decreased from ~9.55 to ~7.3 log cfu/g after 60 days of frozen storage while that of encapsulated cells merely decreased less than 1 log cycle. Encapsulation with alginate microbeads protected the probiotic cells against injuries in the freezing stage as well as, during frozen storage.
TI  - Effect of an oxygenating agent on oral bacteria in vitro and on dental plaque composition in healthy young adults.
AB  - Oral bacteria live in symbiosis with the host. Therefore, when mouthwashes are indicated, selective inhibition of taxa contributing to disease is preferred instead of broad-spectrum antimicrobials. The potential selectivity of an oxygenating mouthwash, Ardox-X(R) (AX), has not been assessed. The aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial potential of AX and the effects of a twice-daily oral rinse on dental plaque composition. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In vitro, 16 oral bacterial strains were tested using agar diffusion susceptibility, minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericidal concentration tests. A pilot clinical study was performed with 25 healthy volunteers. Clinical assessments and microbiological sampling of supragingival plaque were performed at 1 month before the experiment (Pre-exp), at the start of the experiment (Baseline) and after the one-week experimental period (Post-exp). During the experiment individuals used AX mouthwash twice daily in absence of other oral hygiene measures. The microbiological composition of plaque was assessed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. RESULTS: AX showed high inter-species variation in microbial growth inhibition. The tested Prevotella strains and Fusobacterium nucleatum showed the highest sensitivity, while streptococci and Lactobacillus acidophilus were most resistant to AX. Plaque scores at Pre-exp and Baseline visits did not differ significantly (p = 0.193), nor did the microbial composition of plaque. During a period of 7-days non-brushing but twice daily rinsing plaque scores increased from 2.21 (0.31) at Baseline to 2.43 (0.39) Post-exp. A significant microbial shift in composition was observed: genus Streptococcus and Veillonella increased while Corynebacterium, Haemophilus, Leptotrichia, Cardiobacterium and Capnocytophaga decreased (p </= 0.001). CONCLUSION: AX has the potential for selective inhibition of oral bacteria. The shift in oral microbiome after 1 week of rinsing deserves further research.
TI  - Synbiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and cellobiose does not affect human gut bacterial diversity but increases abundance of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and branched-chain fatty acids: a randomized, double-blinded cross-over trial.
AB  - Probiotics, prebiotics, and combinations thereof, that is synbiotics, have been reported to modulate gut microbiota of humans. In this study, effects of a novel synbiotic on the composition and metabolic activity of human gut microbiota were investigated. Healthy volunteers (n = 18) were enrolled in a double-blinded, randomized, and placebo-controlled cross-over study and received synbiotic [Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM (10(9) CFU) and cellobiose (5 g)] or placebo daily for 3 weeks. Fecal samples were collected and lactobacilli numbers were quantified by qPCR. Furthermore, 454 tag-encoded amplicon pyrosequencing was used to monitor the effect of synbiotic on the composition of the microbiota. The synbiotic increased levels of Lactobacillus spp. and relative abundances of the genera Bifidobacterium, Collinsella, and Eubacterium while the genus Dialister was decreased (P < 0.05). No other effects were found on microbiota composition. Remarkably, however, the synbiotic increased concentrations of branched-chain fatty acids, measured by gas chromatography, while short-chain fatty acids were not affected.
TI  - A novel antimicrobial orthodontic band cement with in situ-generated silver nanoparticles.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop an antimicrobial orthodontic band cement for the prevention of white spot lesions using a novel process that generates silver nanoparticles (AgNP) in situ. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven groups of AgNP-loaded Opal Band Cement (OBC) and two control groups were formulated with varying concentrations of additional benzoyl peroxide (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0 wt%) and 2,2-(p-Tolylimino) diethanol (0.5 or 1 wt%). Rockwell15T hardness and near-infrared FTIR were used to assess degree of cure, three-point bending was used to determine modulus and ultimate transverse strength (UTS), and Ag(+) ion release was measured for up to 4 months in vitro using atomic absorption spectroscopy. Antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus was tested in vitro by counting colony-forming units for up to 28 days. Biocompatibility was evaluated following ISO specifications 7405 (2008), 10993-3 (2003), 10993-5 (2009), and 10993-10 (2010). RESULTS: Most of the experimental groups had hardness, modulus, and UTS values similar to those of the control group. Ag(+) ion release was observed for all AgNP-loaded groups for up to 4 months. Increase in Ag loading increased Ag(+) ion release and in vitro antimicrobial effect. The biocompatibility of the optimal AgNP-loaded OBC was comparable to that of negative controls. CONCLUSION: A novel antimicrobial orthodontic band cement was developed that has comparable mechanical properties to controls, controlled and sustained Ag(+) ion release, significant bacterial inhibition in vitro, and excellent biocompatibility.
TI  - Cell growth and proteolytic activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus  helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus in milk as affected by supplementation with peptide fractions.
AB  - The present investigation examined the effects of supplementation of milk peptide fractions produced by enzymatic hydrolysis on the fermentation of reconstituted skim milk (RSM). Changes in pH, cell growth, proteolytic activity, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity were monitored during fermentation of RSM by pure cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. The study showed that supplementation with peptide fractions of different molecular weights did not significantly affect the bacterial growth in RSM. All bacteria showed an increased proteolytic activity in RSM supplemented with large peptides (>10 kDa), and L. helveticus in general exhibited the highest proteolytic activity among the bacteria studied. The ACE-inhibitory activity was observed to be the maximum in RSM supplemented with larger peptides (>10 kDa) for all bacteria. The results suggest that proteolysis by bacteria leads to increased production of ACE-inhibitory peptides compared to the supplemented peptides produced by enzymatic hydrolysis.
TI  - Evaluation of the effect of supplementing fermented milk with quinoa flour on probiotic activity.
AB  - In this work, we investigated the effect of supplementing fermented milk with quinoa flour as an option to increase probiotic activity during fermented milk production and storage. Fermented milk products were produced with increasing concentrations of quinoa flour (0, 1, 2, or 3g/100g) and submitted to the following analyses at 1, 14, and 28 d of refrigerated storage: postacidification, bacterial viability, resistance of probiotics to simulated gastrointestinal (GI) conditions, and adhesion of probiotics to Caco-2 cells in vitro. The kinetics of acidification were measured during the fermentation process. The time to reach maximum acidification rate, time to reach pH 5.0, and time to reach pH 4.6 (end of fermentation) were similar for all treatments. Adding quinoa flour had no effect on fermentation time; however, it did contribute to postacidification of the fermented milk during storage. Quinoa flour did not affect counts of Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis BB-12 or Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 during storage, it did not protect the probiotic strains during simulated GI transit, and it did not have a positive effect on the adhesion of probiotic bacteria to Caco-2 cells in vitro. Additionally, the adhesion of strains to Caco-2 cells decreased during refrigerated storage of fermented milk. Although the addition of up to 3% quinoa flour had a neutral effect on probiotic activity, its incorporation to fermented milk can be recommended because it is an ingredient with high nutritive value, which may increase the appeal of the product to consumers.
TI  - Superior prebiotic and physicochemical properties of novel dextran from Weissella cibaria JAG8 for potential food applications.
AB  - The dextran produced by dextransucrase from Weissella cibaria JAG8 was subjected  to physicochemical characterization and assessment of its prebiotic potential. Dextran displayed a solubility of 24.5% and a water holding capacity of 352%. The emulsion and flocculation activity of dextran were 89% and 92%, respectively. The degradation temperature (Td) of dextran was 353 degrees C. Dextran exhibited 33- and 12-fold less hydrolysis than inulin, in simulated gastric juice (pH 1.0) and alpha-amylase (pH 7.0), respectively. Dextran stimulated the growth of probiotic bacteria such as Bifidobacterium animalis subspecies lactis, Bifidobacterium infantis and Lactobacillus acidophilus significantly and was comparable to that of commercial inulin. However, the growth of E. coli was not enhanced by dextran or inulin. The dextran used in this study can be used as a potential prebiotic for health benefits.
TI  - Effects of probiotic yogurt on fat distribution and gene expression of proinflammatory factors in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in overweight and obese people with or without weight-loss diet.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether probiotics had an effect on proinflammatory markers and cytokines in overweight and obese individuals and whether they could have synergistic effects with weight-loss diets. METHODS: A total of 75 healthy overweight and obese individuals completed this randomized doubled-blind controlled clinical trial. Participants were randomly assigned to groups consuming regular yogurt with a low-calorie diet (LCD, RLCD; n = 25) or receiving probiotic yogurt with LCD (PLCD; n = 25) or consuming probiotic yogurt without LCD (PWLCD; n = 25) for 8 weeks. The pribiotic regimen contained 200 g/day yogurt, enriched by Lactobacillus acidophilus La5, Bifidobacterium BB12, and Lactobacillus casei DN001 10(8) colony-forming units/g. Body fat percentage, high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), leptin, and mRNA levels of inflammation-related genes (TNF-alpha and RAR-related orphan receptor gamma [ROR-gammat]) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were measured. RESULTS: A reduction in body mass index (BMI), fat percentage, and leptin level was observed that was more obvious in groups who received the weight-loss diet with probiotic yogurt. Reduction in the gene expression of ROR-gammat was significant in the PLCD group (p < 0.001). The expression of TNF-alpha did not change among all groups after intervention. The mean concentration of leptin was significantly decreased in all groups after the dietary intervention, but the mean changes in leptin level in the PLCD group was more prominent compared to the other two groups (-2.38, p < 0.001 [PLCD] vs -1.75, p = 0.002 [RLCD] and -0.55 ng/mL, p = 0.12 [PWLCD]). The reduction in serum levels of hs-CRP was more evident in the PWLCD group compared to the PLCD and RLCD groups after the 8-week intervention (-3.4, p = 0.03 vs -1.76, p < 0.001 and -2.98 pg/mL, p < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that the weight-loss diet and probiotic yogurt had synergistic effects on T-cells subset specific gene expression in PBMCs, fat percentage, and body weight among overweight and obese individuals.
TI  - Functional characterization of probiotic surface layer protein-carrying Lactobacillus amylovorus strains.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adhesiveness to intestinal epithelium, beneficial immunomodulating effects and the production of pathogen-inhibitory compounds are generally considered as beneficial characteristics of probiotic organisms. We showed the potential health-promoting properties and the mechanisms of probiotic action of seven swine intestinal Lactobacillus amylovorus isolates plus the type strain (DSM 20531T) by investigating their adherence to porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-1) and mucus as well as the capacities of the strains to i) inhibit the adherence of Escherichia coli to IPEC-1 cells, ii) to produce soluble inhibitors against intestinal pathogens and iii) to induce immune signaling in dendritic cells (DCs). Moreover, the role of the L. amylovorus surface (S) -layers - symmetric, porous arrays of identical protein subunits present as the outermost layer of the cell envelope - in adherence to IPEC-1 cells was assessed using a novel approach which utilized purified cell wall fragments of the strains as carriers for the recombinantly produced S-layer proteins. RESULTS: Three of the L. amylovorus strains studied adhered to IPEC-1 cells, while four strains inhibited the adherence of E. coli, indicating additional mechanisms other than competition for binding sites being involved in the inhibition. None of the strains bound to porcine mucus. The culture supernatants of all of the strains exerted inhibitory effects on the growth of E. coli, Salmonella, Listeria and Yersinia, and a variable, strain-dependent induction was observed of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in human DCs. L. amylovorus DSM 16698 was shown to carry two S-layer-like proteins on its surface in addition to the major S-layer protein SlpA. In contrast to expectations, none of the major S-layer proteins of the IPEC-1 -adhering strains mediated bacterial adherence. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated adhesive and significant pathogen inhibitory efficacies among the swine intestinal L. amylovorus strains studied, pointing to their potential use as probiotic feed supplements, but no independent role could be demonstrated for the major S-layer proteins in adherence to epithelial cells. The results indicate that many intestinal bacteria may coexist with and confer benefits to the host by mechanisms not attributable to adhesion to epithelial cells or mucus.
TI  - Effects of a symbiotic on gut microbiota in Mexican patients with end-stage renal disease.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Gut microbiota provides beneficial effects under physiological conditions, but is able to contribute to inflammatory diseases in susceptible individuals. Thus, we designed this study to test whether additional intake of symbiotic gel affects specific modifications of gut microbiota in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). METHODS: Eighteen patients with ESRD diagnosis with renal replacement therapy (hemodialysis) were included in this study. They were randomly assigned to 2 treatment groups: (1) test group (nutritional counseling + symbiotic) and (2) control group (nutritional counseling + placebo). Clinical history and the evaluation of Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale were performed. Gut microbiota composition was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction from fecal samples. All subjects were followed for 2 months. RESULTS: Bifidobacterial counts were higher in the second samples (mean: 5.5 +/- 1.72 log10 cells/g) than in first samples (4.2 +/- 0.88 log 10 cells/g) in the patients of the test group (P = .0344). Also, lactobacilli counts had a little decrease in the test group (2.3 +/- 0.75 to 2.0 +/- 0.88 log 10 cells/g) and the control group (2.2 +/- 0.90 to 1.8 +/- 1.33 log 10 cells/g), between the first and the second samples. Gastrointestinal symptoms scores (scale 8-40) were reduced in the test group (start 12 [10-14] and end 9 [8-10]) compared with control group (start 11 [8-21] and end 11 [9-15]). CONCLUSIONS: Short-term symbiotic treatment in patients with ESRD can lead to the increase of Bifidobacterium counts, maintaining the intestinal microbial balance.
TI  - Effect of KCl substitution on bacterial viability of Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and selected probiotics.
AB  - Excessive intake of NaCl has been associated with the increased risk of several diseases, particularly hypertension. Strategies to reduce sodium intake include substitution of NaCl with other salts, such as KCl. In this study, the effects of NaCl reduction and its substitution with KCl on cell membranes of a cheese starter bacterium (Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis), probiotic bacteria (Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus casei), and a pathogenic bacterium (Escherichia coli) were investigated using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. A critical NaCl concentration that inhibited the viability of E. coli without affecting the viability of probiotic bacteria significantly was determined. To find the critical NaCl concentration, de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe (MRS) broth was supplemented with a range of NaCl concentrations [0 (control), 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, and 5.0%], and the effect on cell viability and FTIR spectra was monitored for all bacteria. A NaCl concentration of 2.5% was found to be the critical level of NaCl to inhibit E. coli without significantly affecting the viability of most of the probiotic bacteria and the cheese starter bacterium. The FTIR spectral analysis also highlighted the changes that occurred mainly in the amide regions upon increasing the NaCl concentration from 2.5 to 3.0% in most of the bacteria. Escherichia coli and B. longum were more sensitive to substitution of NaCl with KCl, compared with Lb. acidophilus, Lb. casei, and Lc. lactis ssp. lactis. To evaluate the effect of substitution of NaCl with KCl, substitution was carried out at the critical total salt concentration (2.5%, wt/vol) at varying concentrations (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100% KCl). The findings suggest that 50% substitution of NaCl with KCl, at 2.5% total salt, could inhibit E. coli without affecting the probiotic bacteria.
TI  - Orally delivered microencapsulated probiotic formulation favorably impacts polyp  formation in APC (Min/+) model of intestinal carcinogenesis.
AB  - The development of intestinal polyps in an orthotopic colorectal mouse model, receiving a probiotic yogurt formulation containing microencapsulated live Lactobacillus acidophilus cells was investigated. The expression of various immunohistochemical markers namely CD8, Mac-1, Ki-67, and cleaved caspase-3, was evaluated. Results suggest that the probiotic formulation decreases overall intestinal inflammation. Mice receiving the probiotic formulation were found to develop almost two-fold fewer tumors in the small intestines. In the large intestine, however, there was no significant difference observed among polyp numbers. The formulation appears to have potential application in the prevention of various GI pathological conditions.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus attenuates downregulation of DRA function and expression in inflammatory models.
AB  - Probiotics, including Lactobacilli, are commensal bacteria that have been used in clinical trials and experimental models for the prevention and treatment of diarrheal disorders. Our previous studies have shown that Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) and its culture supernatant (CS) stimulated Cl(-)/HCO3 (-) exchange activity, acutely via an increase in the surface levels of downregulated in adenoma (DRA, SLC26A3) and in long-term treatments via increasing its expression involving transcriptional mechanisms. However, the role of LA in modulating DRA activity under inflammatory conditions is not known. Current in vitro studies using human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells examined the efficacy of LA or its CS in counteracting the inhibitory effects of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) on Cl(-)/HCO3 (-) exchange activity. Pretreatment of cells with LA or LA-CS for 1 h followed by coincubation with IFN-gamma significantly alleviated the inhibitory effects of IFN-gamma on Cl(-)/HCO3 (-) exchange activity. In the in vivo model of dextran sulfate sodium-induced experimental colitis (3% in drinking water for 7 days) in C57BL/6J mice, administration of live LA (3 x 10(9) colony-forming units) via oral gavage attenuated colonic inflammation. LA administration also counteracted the colitis-induced decrease in DRA mRNA and protein levels. Efficacy of LA or its secreted soluble factors in alleviating inflammation and inflammation-associated dysregulation of DRA activity could justify their therapeutic potential in inflammatory diarrheal diseases.
TI  - Effect of yogurt containing polydextrose, Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and Bifidobacterium lactis HN019: a randomized, double-blind, controlled study in chronic constipation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Constipation is a frequent complaint and the combination of a prebiotic and probiotics could have a potentially synergic effect on the intestinal transit. The present study therefore aims to investigate the combination of polydextrose (Litesse), L. acidophilus NCFM(R) and B. lactis HN019 in a yogurt on intestinal transit in subjects who suffer from constipation. METHODS: Patients with constipation were randomly divided into two groups, Control Group (CG) and Treatment Group (TG), and had to eat 180 ml of unflavored yogurt every morning for 14 days. Those in the CG received only yogurt, while the TG received yogurt containing polydextrose, L. acidophilus NCFM (ATCC 700396) and B. lactis HN019 (AGAL NM97/09513). RESULTS: Favourable clinical response was assessed since Agachan score had a significant reduction at the end of the study in both groups and tended to be better in the TG. The subjects in the treatment group also had a shorter transit time at the end of the intervention compared to the control group (p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: The product containing yogurt with polydextrose, B. lactis HN019 and L. acidophilus NCFM(R) significantly shortened colonic transit time after two weeks in the TG compared to CG and may be an option for treatment of constipation.
TI  - Effects of probiotic supplementation over 5 months on routine haematology and clinical chemistry measures in healthy active adults.
AB  - Use of probiotic-containing foods and probiotic supplements is increasing; however, few studies document safety and tolerability in conjunction with defined clinical end points. This paper reports the effects of 150 days of supplementation with either a single- (Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bl-04) or a double-strain (Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bi-07) probiotic on routine haematology and clinical chemistry measures in healthy active adults. Pre- to post-intervention changes in laboratory measures were determined and compared between supplement and placebo groups. Overall there were few differences in routine haematology and clinical chemistry measures between supplement and placebo groups post-intervention. Exceptions included plasma calcium (P=0.03) and urea (P=0.015); however, observed changes were small and within assay-specific laboratory reference ranges. These data provide evidence supporting the use of these probiotic supplements over a period of 5 months in healthy active adults without obvious safety or tolerability issues.
TI  - Interaction evaluation of bacteria and protoplasts with single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid library based on capillary electrophoresis.
AB  - For whole-cell aptamers selection, cells surface situation has great impact on single-stranded (ssDNA) binding and aptamers selection. In this work, both Lactobacillus acidophilus and Escherichia coli as well as their protoplasts were as cells targets, their interaction with ssDNA library were evaluated based on capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) and affinity capillary electrophoresis (ACE) with UV and LIF detection. Our results demonstrated that protoplasts without cells wall had apparently stronger interaction with ssDNA library than bacteria, the protoplasts-ssDNA complex could be observed clearly with CZE-LIF. Furthermore, E. coli pretreated by four organic solvents (methanol, ethanol, formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde) showed binding difference with ssDNA library, which could be identified with ACE-UV. Binding constants indicated the interaction of E. coli with ssDNA library were in the order of E. coli protoplasts>methanol (ethanol) treated E. coli>formaldehyde (glutaraldehyde) treated E. coli approximately E. coli. Above results suggest that cells surface situation determines their binding affinity with ssDNA, which should be considered in whole-cell aptamers selection and aptamers further application. Capillary electrophoresis is a preferable technique for interaction evaluation of composite targets binding with ssDNA library.
TI  - Development of synbiotics with inulin, palatinose, alpha-cyclodextrin and probiotic bacteria.
AB  - Success in creating a synbiotic depends on compatibility between the chosen components--prebiotic and probiotic. In this work the interactions between Lactobacillus sp. strains isolated from yogurts and type strains of Lactobacillus sp. and Lactococcus sp., and the dependence of their growth and antibacterial activity on three oligosaccharides (OS)--palatinose, inulin and alpha-cyclodextrin were investigated. All isolated lactobacilli produce antibacterial compounds, which possibly are the bacteriocins of Lactobacillus casei ATCC334 strain. Results of growth analysis with different OS revealed that part of lactobacilli isolated from yogurts can effectively ferment inulin and may be used for the development of synbiotics. Palatinose and Lactobacillus acidophilus could be used as symbiotics with effective antibacterial activity. One of the types of Lactococcus sp. strains can assimilate palatinose and alpha-cyclodextrin, so they both can be used as components of synbiotics with the investigated lactococci. Results of this analysis suggest that the investigated isolated and type strains of Lactobacillus sp. and Lactoccocus sp. can be useful as probiotics in the development of synbiotics. Together with prebiotics--palatinose, inulin and alpha-cyclodextrin, the synbiotics, which could regulate not only the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract, but also their antibacterial activity, can be created.
TI  - Synbiotic (Lactobacillus rhamnosus+Lactobacillus acidophilus+inulin) attenuates oxidative stress and colonic damage in 1,2 dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride-induced colon carcinogenesis in Sprague-Dawley rats: a long-term study.
AB  - The inexorable increase in the incidence of colorectal cancer has led to growing  interest in its prevention by natural interventions. Thus, the present study was designed with the aim of delineating the antioxidative and antitumorigenic effects of synbiotics in experimental colon carcinogenesis. It was observed that administration of a synbiotic, before 1,2 dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride (DMH)-induced colon carcinogenesis in Sprague-Dawley rats, led to increased body weight and growth rate, and decreased tumor incidence compared with the DMH-only-treated group of animals. Most notably, the level of malondialdehyde, a measure of lipid peroxidation, decreased, and levels of the antioxidants, glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase increased in animals in the Lactobacillus acidophilus+DMH, inulin+DMH, and synbiotic+DMH groups compared with DMH-only-treated animals. Histopathological observations of the colon also documented fewer dysplastic changes and increased the number of goblet cells in the probiotic-treated, prebiotic-treated, and synbiotic-treated animals compared with DMH-only-treated animals. Taken together, the present study shows that the use of synbiotics is a better prophylactic strategy than the use of probiotic and prebiotic alone because of the greater increase in antioxidants associated with the higher degree of attenuation of DMH-induced tumorigenesis.
TI  - Effects of Citrus junos by-products fermented with multistrain probiotics on growth performance, immunity, caecal microbiology and meat oxidative stability in broilers.
AB  - 1. The present study was conducted to develop Citrus junos probiotics (CJP), using by-products of Citrus junos fermented with multispecies probiotic bacteria including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bacillus subtilis. The effects of dietary CJP on the growth performance, immune status, caecal microbiology and meat oxidative stability of broiler were investigated. 2. A total of 240 one-day-old Ross broiler chicks were used in a 35-d experiment in which the chicks were randomly allotted to one of the 4 dietary treatments (0, 5, 10 and 20 g CJP/kg diet) in a completely randomised design. 3. Dietary supplementation of 5 g/kg CJP significantly increased body weight, average daily gain and average daily feed intake of broiler during the overall experimental period. 4. Serum immunoglobulin (Ig)M concentration was significantly increased by 10 and 20 g/kg CJP, whereas the IgG and IgA concentration remained unaffected. In addition, 20 g/kg CJP significantly inhibited proliferation of Escherichia coli without affecting the concentration of Lactobacillus or Bacillus spp. 5. A significant reduction in the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances values of breast and thigh meat was observed in response to increasing concentration of dietary CJP. 6. Thus, the results suggest that CJP up to a concentration of 20 g/kg can be used in the diet of broilers to improve immunity and to reduce caecal E. coli and TBARS values of breast and thigh meat without any adverse effects on growth performance.
TI  - Plasma deactivation of oral bacteria seeded on hydroxyapatite disks as tooth enamel analogue.
AB  - PURPOSE: To study the plasma treatment effects on deactivation of oral bacteria seeded on a tooth enamel analogue. METHODS: A non-thermal atmospheric pressure argon plasma brush was used to treat two different Gram-positive oral bacteria including Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) and Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans). The bacteria were seeded on hydroxyapatite (HA) disks used as tooth enamel analogue with three initial bacterial seeding concentrations: a low inoculum concentration between 2.1 x 10(8) and 2.4 x 10(8) cfu/mL, a medium inoculum concentration between 9.8x10(8) and 2.4 x 10(9) cfu/mL, and a high inoculum concentration between 1.7 x 10(10) and 3.5 x 10(10) cfu/mL. The bacterial survivability upon plasma exposure was examined in terms of plasma exposure time and oxygen addition into the plasmas. SEM was performed to examine bacterial morphological changes after plasma exposure. RESULTS: The experimental data indicated that a 13-second plasma exposure time completely killed all the bacteria when initial bacterial seeding density on HA surfaces was less than 6.9 x 10(6) cfu/cm2 for L. acidophilus and 1.7 x 10(7) cfu/cm2 for S. mutans, which resulted from low initial seeding inoculum concentration between 2.1 x 10(8) and 2.4 x 10(8) cfu/mL. Plasma exposure of the bacteria at higher initial bacterial seeding density obtained with high initial seeding inoculum concentration, however, only resulted in approximately 1.5 to 2 log reduction and approximately 2 to 2.5 log reduction for L. acidophilus and S. mutans, respectively. It was also noted that oxygen addition into the argon plasma brush did not affect the plasma deactivation effectiveness. SEM images showed that plasma deactivation mainly occurred with the top layer bacteria, while shadowing effects from the resulting bacterial debris reduced the plasma deactivation of the underlying bacteria.
TI  - Co-culture fermentation of peanut-soy milk for the development of a novel functional beverage.
AB  - Most of the commercial probiotic products are dairy-based, and the development of non-dairy probiotic products could be an alternative for new functional products. The peanut-soy milk (PSM(1)) was inoculated with six different lactic acid bacteria (LAB), including probiotic strains and yeasts and fermentation was accomplished for 24h at 37 degrees C and afterwards, another 24h at +/-4 degrees C. The Pediococcus acidilactici (UFLA BFFCX 27.1), Lactococcus lactis (CCT 0360), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LR 32) probiotic LAB, and the Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (LB 340) yogurt starter culture reached cell concentrations of about 8.3log CFU/mL during fermentation. However, these strains were not able to acidify the substrate when inoculated as pure culture. The Lactobacillus acidophilus (LACA 4) probiotic produced significant amounts of lactic acid (3.35 g/L) and rapidly lowered the pH (4.6). Saccharomyces cerevisiae (UFLA YFFBM 18.03) did not completely consume the available sugars in PSM and consequently produced low amounts of ethanol (0.24 g/L). In pure culture, S. cerevisiae (UFLA YFFBM 18.03), L. rhamnosus (LR 32), L. acidophilus (LACA 4), and P. acidilactici (UFLA BFFCX 27.1) promoted the increase of total amino acids (48.02%, 47.32%, 46.21% and, 44.07%, respectively). However, when in co-cultured, the strains consumed the free amino acids favoring their growth, and reaching the population of 8log CFU/mL in PSM. Lactic acid production increased, and 12 h was required to reach a pH value of 4.3. In general, the strains were more efficient in the use of available carbohydrates and release of metabolites in co-cultured than in single culture fermentations. An average of 58% and 78% of available carbohydrates was consumed when single and co-cultures were evaluated, respectively. Higher lactic acid contents were found in a binary culture of P. acidilactici (UFLA BFFCX 27.1) and L. acidophilus (LACA 4), and by co-culture of P. acidilactici (UFLA BFFCX 27.1), L. acidophilus (LACA 4) and S. cerevisiae (UFLA YFFBM 18.03) (9.03 and 8.51 g/L, respectively). The final content of ethanol was 0.03% (v/v) or less, which classified the final beverage as non-alcoholic.
TI  - Fermentation adaptability of three probiotic Lactobacillus strains to oat, germinated oat and malted oat substrates.
AB  - Functional foods targeting the improvement of gastrointestinal health are widely  recognized; of these, dairy-based probiotics are the most popular. Thus, the design of nondairy probiotics applying fruits, vegetables and cereals has raised great interest in the healthy food sector. The objective of this work was to assess the potential of germinated and malted oat substrates to support the growth of the probiotic cultures Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. Fermentations were carried out with distinctive oat substrates at inoculum levels of 3, 5 and 7% v/v, substrate concentrations of 3, 5 and 7% w/v and with sucrose addition 1.5% w/v. Lag phase profiles, maximum growth rates and maximal growths were evaluated; protein and sugar contents were also quantified. There was no significant effect (P > 0.05) of the inoculum size on the fermentation kinetics; however, oat media significantly affected the growth kinetics. In simple oat media, Lact. acidophilus exhibited biphasic growth patterns. Lactobacillus growth patterns were significantly affected (P < 0.05) by the supplementation with protein sources. The germination and malting processes significantly improved oats nutrient characteristics demonstrating to be adequate substrates for the fermentation with probiotic lactobacilli. Significance and impact of the study: In this work, the effect of oat media composition and fermentation conditions on the growth kinetics of three probiotic lactobacilli was determined. The variation in the inoculum levels did not have a significant effect on the probiotic cultures growth. Results revealed that protein supplemented simple, germinated and malted oat enhanced the cell viability of the probiotic lactobacilli; Lactobacillus casei exhibited better growth adaptability. The results also highlight that different weight in volume oat substrate concentrations has particular effects on Lact. casei growth kinetics. Our results contribute to a better understanding of oat-based media formulations as substrates for probiotic cultures.
TI  - Synbiotic in the management of infantile colic: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  - AIM: Infant colic is a frequent problem affecting up to 10-30% of infants in first 3 months of life. Results from previous trials have shown that manipulation of gut microbiota can lead to symptomatic improvements. In a randomised clinical trial, we aimed to determine efficacy of synbiotic in reducing average infant crying time at day 7 and day 30 after starting intervention. METHODS: Fifty breastfed infants aged 15-120 days with infantile colic randomly assigned to receive either the synbiotic sachet containing 1 billion CFU of: Lactobacillus casei, L. rhamnosus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Bifidobacterium breve, L. acidophilus, B. infantis, L. bulgaricus and fructooligosacharide (Protexin Healthcare, Somerset, UK), or placebo daily for 30 days. Parents were asked to record details of crying times in a symptoms diary. The primary outcome measure was the treatment success (reduction in the daily crying time >50%) and the secondary outcome measure was symptom resolution (reduction in the daily crying time >90%). RESULTS: The treatment success was significantly higher in synbiotic group (82.6%) compared with placebo (35.7%) at day 7 (P < 0.005). At day30, treatment success was 87% and 46% in synbiotic and placebo group, respectively (P < 0.01). Symptom resolution was also higher in synbiotic group (39%) compared with placebo (7%) at day 7 (P < 0.03) but not at day 30 (56% vs.36%, P = 0.24). We encountered no complication related to synbiotic use. CONCLUSION: This synbiotic (a mixture of seven probiotic strains plus FOS) significantly improved colic symptoms in comparison with placebo.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of extracts from Ugandan medicinal plants used for oral  care.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Medicinal plants are widely used for treatment of oral/dental diseases in Uganda. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate antibacterial activities of 16 commonly used medicinal plants on microorganisms associated with periodontal diseases (PD) and dental caries (DC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pulp juice and solvent extracts (hexane, methanol and water) from the plants were tested against Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia associated with PD and Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus acidophilus associated with DC. Tests were done using agar well-diffusion (pulp juice) and agar-dilution (Solvent extracts) assays. RESULTS: Pulp juice from Zanthoxylum chalybeum and Euclea latidens showed activity against all the bacteria, Zanthoxylum chalybeum being most active. Hexane extract from aerial part of Helichrysum odoratissimum was most active (MIC: 0.125-0.5 mg/ml). Methanol extract from leaves of Lantana trifolia showed activity against all bacteria (MIC: 0.25-1 mg/ml). CONCLUSION: Several of the tested plants showed antibacterial activities against bacteria associated with PD and DC, meriting further investigations.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of antibacterial activity of total-etch and self-etch adhesive systems: An ex vitro study.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this ex vivo study was to compare the antibacterial activity of total-etch and self-etch adhesive systems against Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Actinomyces viscosus through disk diffusion method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antibacterial effects of Single Bond (SB) and Adper Prompt (AP) and aqueous solution of chlorhexidine 0.2% (positive control) were tested against standard strain of S. mutans, L. acidophilus, and A. viscosus using the disk diffusion method. The diameters of inhibition zones were measured in millimeters. Data was analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis test. Mann-Whitney U test was used for pairwise comparison. RESULT: Of all the materials tested, AP showed the maximum inhibitory action against S. mutans and L. acidophilus. Aqueous solution of chlorhexidine 0.2% showed the maximum inhibitory action against A. viscosus. Very minimal antibacterial effect was noted for SB. CONCLUSION: The antibacterial effects observed for the tested different dentin bonding systems may be related to the acidic nature of the materials.
TI  - Effect of intestinal colonisation by two Lactobacillus strains on the immune response of gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - The effect of intestinal colonisation on the immune system was investigated in germ-free mice monoassociated with Lactobacillus strains isolated from calf faeces. Single doses of Lactobacillus acidophilus L36 or Lactobacillus salivarius L38 were administered to germ-free mice by intragastric gavage. Ten days later, the mice were euthanised. Gene expression levels of interleukin 5 (IL-5), IL-6, IL-10, IL-12b, IL-17a, gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta1), and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) were quantified in segments of the small and large intestines by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. All the mice were colonised rapidly after Lactobacillus administration with intestinal counts ranging from 6.53 to 8.26 log cfu/g. L. acidophilus L36 administration increased the expression of cytokines involved with the Th2 (IL-5, IL-6 and TGF-beta1) and Th17 (IL-17a, TNF-alpha and IL-6) inflammatory response, whereas L. salivarius L38 appeared to stimulate a pattern of less diversified cytokines in the intestine. Intragastric gavage of L. acidophilus L36 and L. salivarius L38 induced similar levels of colonisation in the digestive tracts of germ-free mice but stimulated different immune responses in the intestinal mucosa. The different immunomodulation patterns might facilitate the potential use of these lactobacilli as probiotics to treat distinct pathological conditions, for example protection against Citrobacter rodentium infection by stimulating IL-17 production.
TI  - n-Butanol extract of Rhynchosia volubilis Lour: a potent spermicidal agent In Vitro.
AB  - Rhynchosia volubilis Lour has been a major drug in a folk prescription for contraception in China, whereas its mechanism remains unknown. Its antifertility effects on male mice and antimicrobial activities on sexually transmitted infection (STI) pathogens were previously reported. This study was undertaken to develop the n-Butanol extract of Rhynchosia volubilis Lour (BERVL) as a spermicidal agent with STI prevention. The spermicidal activities of BERVL with different doses were assessed using selected high-motile sperms of normal human semen samples, and their inhibitory effects on Lactobacillus acidophilus were determined. The mechanism of the spermicidal activity was explored by aqueous Eosin Y and Hoechst 33342/PI staining. The results showed spermicidal activities and inhibitory effects of BERVL on Lactobacillus acidophilus were dose-dependent. Dose of 90 mg/mL BERVL terminated all progressive sperm motility within 2 min, and had slight inhibitory effect on Lactobacillus acidophilus, suggesting it was an effective and safe dose for contraception use. About 80% sperms exposed to BERVL displayed changes consistent with high permeability of head membrane. It is concluded that BERVL as spermicide has advantages over N-9 with strong ability to instantaneously kill human sperm and possesses light inhibitory effect on Lactobacillus acidophilus.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus crispatus culture supernatants downregulate expression of cancer-testis genes in the MDA-MB-231 cell line.
AB  - Lactobacilli are probiotics shown to have antitumor activities. In addition, they can regulate gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms. In this study, we aimed to assess anti tumor activities of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus crispatus on the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line. The effects of culture supernatants were determined by MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-y-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay. Changes in expression of 5 cancer-testis antigens (CTAs), namely AKAP4, ODF4, PIWIL2, RHOXF2 and TSGA10 ,were analyzed by quantitative real time RT-PCR. The culture supernatants of the 2 lactobacilli inhibited MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation. In addition, transcriptional activity of all mentioned CTAs except AKAP4 was significantly decreased after 24 hour treatment with culture supernatants. This study shows that Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus crispatus have antiproliferative activity against MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, these lactobacilli could decrease transcriptional activity of 4 CTAs. Previous studies have shown that expression of CTAs is epigenetically regulated, so it is possible that lactobacilli cause this expression downregulation through epigenetic mechanisms. As expression of CTAs in cancers is usually associated with higher grades and poor prognosis, downregulation of their expression by lactobacilli may have clinical implications.
TI  - Potentiated anti-microsporidial activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus CH1 bacteriocin using gold nanoparticles.
AB  - Through increased awareness and improved diagnostics, microsporidiosis has now been identified in a broader range of human populations; however current therapies are inconsistently effective. Recently, probiotics were determined as means for the control of intestinal parasitic infections through their secretory products; bacteriocins. This is the first study on the effect of bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus CH1 bacteriocin, with or without gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs), against intestinal microsporidiosis in immunosuppressed mice. Fecal and intestinal spore loads, besides viability, extrusion and infectivity of spores from treated animals were assessed. Results showed that the anti-microsporidial effects of bacteriocin were significantly potent. This efficiency was further potentiated upon conjugating bacteriocins with Au-NPs, as it induced a strikingly sustained reduction in fecal spore shedding after cessation of therapy by 1 week (94.26%). Furthermore, reduction in intestinal spore load was highest in bacteriocin/Au-NPs-inoculated mice (89.7%) followed by bacteriocin-inoculated group (73.5%). Spores encountered from stool of bacteriocin/Au-NPs group showed 92.4% viability, versus 93.7% in bacteriocin group. Spore extrusion and infectivity were most inhibited by exposure to bacteriocin/Au-NPs. Safety of bacteriocin/Au-NPs was also verified. Thus, considering the results of the present work, L. acidophilus CH1-derived bacteriocin can present a powerful safe therapy against intestinal microsporidiosis.
TI  - A comparative study of the effect of probiotics on cariogenic biofilm model for preventing dental caries.
AB  - Dental caries is induced by oral biofilm containing Streptococcus mutans. Probiotic bacteria were mainly studied for effect on the gastrointestinal tract and have been known to promote human health. However, the information of probiotics for oral health has been lack yet. In this study, we investigated influence of various probiotics on oral bacteria or cariogenic biofilm and evaluated candidate probiotics for dental caries among them. The antimicrobial activity of the spent culture medium of probiotics for oral streptococci was performed. Probiotics were added during the biofilm formation with salivary bacteria including S. mutans. The oral biofilms were stained with a fluorescent dye and observed using the confocal laser scanning microscope. To count bacteria in the biofilm, the bacteria were plated on MSB and BHI agar plates after disrupting the biofilm and cultivated. Glucosyltransferases (gtfs) expression of S. mutans and integration of lactobacilli into the biofilm were evaluated by real-time RT-PCR. Among probiotics, Lactobacillus species strongly inhibited growth of oral streptococci. Moreover, Lactobacillus species strongly inhibited formation of cariogenic biofilm model. The expression of gtfs was significantly reduced by Lactobacillus rhamnosus. The integration of L. rhamnosus into the biofilm model did not exhibit. However, L. acidophilus and L casei integrated into the biofilm model. These results suggest that L. rhamnosus may inhibit oral biofilm formation by decreasing glucan production of S. mutans and antibacterial activity and did not integrate into oral biofilm, which can be a candidate for caries prevention strategy.
TI  - Influence of bovine lactoferrin on the growth of selected probiotic bacteria under aerobic conditions.
AB  - Bovine lactoferrin (bLf) is a natural glycoprotein, and it shows broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. However, reports on the influences of bLf on probiotic bacteria have been mixed. We examined the effects of apo-bLf (between 0.25 and 128 mg/mL) on both aerobic and anaerobic cultures of probiotics. We found that bLf had similar effects on the growth of probiotics under aerobic or anaerobic conditions, and that it actively and significantly (at concentrations of >0.25 mg/mL) retarded the growth rate of Bifidobacterium bifidum (ATCC 29521), B. longum (ATCC 15707), B. lactis (BCRC 17394), B. infantis (ATCC 15697), Lactobacillus reuteri (ATCC 23272), L. rhamnosus (ATCC 53103), and L. coryniformis (ATCC 25602) in a dose-dependent manner. Otherwise, minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were 128 or >128 mg/mL against B. bifidum, B. longum, B. lactis, L. reuteri, and L. rhamnosus (ATCC 53103). With regard to MICs, bLf showed at least four-fold lower inhibitory effect on probiotics than on pathogens. Intriguingly, bLf (>0.25 mg/mL) significantly enhanced the growth of Rhamnosus (ATCC 7469) and L. acidophilus (BCRC 14065) by approximately 40-200 %, during their late periods of growth. Supernatants produced from aerobic but not anaerobic cultures of L. acidophilus reduced the growth of Escherichia coli by about 20 %. Thus, bLf displayed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the growth of most probiotic strains under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. An antibacterial supernatant prepared from the aerobic cultures may have significant practical use.
TI  - Enteric coating of granules containing the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - In the present study, a capsule formulation composed of enteric coated granules of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4962 was developed using Eudragit L30D-55 as enteric polymer. Optimization of the capsule formulation was achieved with a maximum viable cell count after 2 h of incubation in acid medium and disintegration time of 1 h in buffer pH 6.8. The amount of Eudragit L30D-55 in the capsules correlated with gastric juice resistance. The best protective qualities against artificial gastric juice were observed when capsules were prepared from granules composed of L. acidophilus, corn starch, lactose monohydrate, polyvinylpyrrolidone and coated with 12.5 % (m/V) of Eudragit L30D-55. Capsule formulation of L. acidophilus in edible broth medium suspension serves as a cheap alternative to the expensive freeze-drying procedure for preparing L. acidophilus. In addition, the enteric coating using Eudragit L30D-55 could protect probiotics from the acidic gastric environment and enhance the bioactivity of probiotics along with replacement of pathogenic microbes in human intestine.
TI  - Differential effects of lactobacilli on activation and maturation of mouse dendritic cells.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are of interest because of their potential to modulate immune responses. The effects of LAB range from regulation to stimulation of the immune system. A series of studies were performed in vitro to study the effects of six lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Lactobacillus helveticus LH-2, Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5, La-115, La-116 and La-14, and Lactobacillus salivarius, on maturation and activation of mouse dendritic cells. Production of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-?, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 by dendritic cells (DCs) was determined after treating cells with live LAB. The expression of DC maturation markers, CD80 and CD40, was also measured using flow cytometry after stimulation with LAB. In addition, the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 2, 4 and 9 by DCs stimulated with LAB was measured. Our results revealed that LAB act differentially on pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine production and induction of co-stimulatory molecules by DCs. Specifically, L. salivarius was found to be the most effective LAB to induce pro-inflammatory cytokine production and expression of co-stimulatory molecules. Moreover, La-14, La-116 and La-5 induced moderate maturation and activation of DCs. On the other hand, LH-2 and La-115 were the least effective lactobacilli to induce DC responses. The present study also revealed that L. salivarius was able to induce the expression of TLR2, 4 and 9 by DCs. In conclusion, various strains and species of LAB can differentially regulate DC activation and maturation, providing further evidence that these bacteria may have the ability to influence and steer immune responses in vivo.
TI  - The effect of probiotics (Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001, Lactobacillus paracasei  LPC-37, and Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM) on the availability of minerals from Dutch-type cheese.
AB  - The use of probiotic cultures in the production of Dutch-type cheeses did not lead to significant changes in their chemical composition but it lowered their acidity. The availability of calcium and magnesium analyzed by in vitro enzymatic hydrolysis was 19 and 35%, respectively; the availability of phosphorus was significantly higher, at >90%. The use of probiotic cultures significantly increased the availability of calcium (~2.5%), phosphorus (~6%), and magnesium (~18%). The in vitro method supports accurate determination of the effect of the Lactobacillus spp. cultures on the availability of mineral compounds ingested with Dutch-type cheese.
TI  - Probiotic assessment of Enterococcus durans 6HL and Lactococcus lactis 2HL isolated from vaginal microflora.
AB  - Forty-five lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from the vaginal specimens of healthy fertile women, and the identities of the bacteria were confirmed by sequencing of their 16S rDNA genes. Among these bacteria, only four isolates were able to resist and survive in low pH, bile salts and simulated in vitro digestion conditions. Lactococcus lactis 2HL, Enterococcus durans 6HL, Lactobacillus acidophilus 36YL and Lactobacillus plantarum 5BL showed the best resistance to these conditions. These strains were evaluated further to assess their ability to adhere to human intestinal Caco-2 cells. Lactococcus lactis 2HL and E. durans 6HL were the most adherent strains. In vitro tests under neutralized pH proved the antimicrobial activity of both strains. Results revealed that the growth of Escherichia coli O26, Staphylococcus aureus and Shigella flexneri was suppressed by both LAB strains. The antibiotic susceptibility tests showed that these strains were sensitive to all nine antibiotics: vancomycin, tetracycline, ampicillin, penicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin, clindamycin, sulfamethoxazole and chloramphenicol. These data suggest that E. durans 6HL and Lactococcus lactis 2HL could be examined further for their useful properties and could be developed as new probiotics.
TI  - Probiotic bacteria survive in Cheddar cheese and modify populations of other lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: Starter lactic acid bacteria in Cheddar cheese face physico-chemical stresses during manufacture and ageing that alter their abilities to survive and to interact with other bacterial populations. Nonstarter bacteria are derived from milk handling, cheese equipment and human contact during manufacture. Probiotic bacteria are added to foods for human health benefits that also encounter physiological stresses and microbial competition that may mitigate their survival during ageing. We added probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus paracasei and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis to full-fat, reduced-fat and low-fat Cheddar cheeses, aiming to study their survival over 270 days of ageing and to determine the role of the cheese matrix in their survival. METHODS AND RESULTS: Probiotic and other lactic acid bacterial populations were enumerated by quantitative PCR using primers specifically targeting the different bacterial genera or species of interest. Bifidobacteria were initially added at 10(6) CFU g(-1) cheese and survived variably in the different cheeses over the 270-day ageing process. Probiotic lactobacilli that were added at 10(7) CFU g(-1) cheese and incident nonstarter lactobacilli (initially at 10(8) CFU g(-1) cheese) increased by 10- to 100-fold over 270 days. Viable bacterial populations were differentiated using propidium monoazide followed by species-specific qPCR assays, which demonstrated that the starter and probiotic microbes survived over ageing, independent of cheese type. Addition of probiotic bacteria, at levels 100-fold below that of starter bacteria, modified starter and nonstarter bacterial levels. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that starter lactococci, nonstarter lactobacilli and probiotic bacteria are capable of surviving throughout the cheesemaking and ageing process, indicating that delivery via hard cheeses is possible. Probiotic addition at lower levels may also alter starter and nonstarter bacterial survival. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: We applied qPCR to study multispecies survival and viability and distinctly enumerated bacterial species in commercial-scale Cheddar cheese manufacture.
TI  - Effect of green tea supplementation on the microbiological, antioxidant, and sensory properties of probiotic milks.
AB  - Green tea and its constituents are known for a wide range of health-promoting properties. They may exert antimicrobial action but without altering lactic acid bacteria. The aim of the present study was to estimate the effect of green tea addition on the selected properties of probiotic milks. Bioyogurts (fermented with ABT-1 coculture of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12) and acidophilus milks (fermented with pure L. acidophilus LA-5 culture) with addition of 0, 5, 10, or 15% (v/v) green tea infusion (GTI) were produced and analyzed for the antioxidant capacity by the "diphenyl picrylhydrazyl" (DPPH) and "ferric-reducing antioxidant power" (FRAP) methods, acidity, the count of starter bacteria, and sensory properties at the 1st, 7th, 14th, and 21st day of cold storage. The 15% addition of GTI to the acidophilus milk significantly reduced the lactic acid production during the whole study. The GTI had no impact on the level of S. thermophilus and B. lactis BB-12 in bioyogurts, and its effect on the count of L. acidophilus LA-5 depended on the concentration and probiotic milk type. GTI similarly and in a dose-dependent manner enhanced the antioxidant capacity of both milk types. There were no significant differences between the sensory notes received for bioyogurts, whereas acidophilus milks with tea were less appreciated by the panelists. In conclusion, green tea could be successfully used as a functional additive for selected probiotic milks enhancing their health benefits, but the proper selection of tea additive and starter culture is recommended.
TI  - Prophylactic use of Lactobacillus acidophilus/Bifidobacterium infantis probiotics and outcome in very low birth weight infants.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate outcome data in an observational cohort of very low birth  weight infants of the German Neonatal Network stratified to prophylactic use of Lactobacillus acidophilus/Bifidobacterium infantis probiotics. STUDY DESIGN: Within the observational period (September 1, 2010, until December 31, 2012, n=5351 infants) study centers were categorized into 3 groups based on their choice of Lactobacillus acidophilus/Bifidobacterium infantis use: (1) no prophylactic use (12 centers); (2 a/b) change of strategy nonuser to user during observational period (13 centers); and (3) use before start of observation (21 centers). Primary outcome data of all eligible infants were determined according to center-specific strategy. RESULTS: The use of probiotics was associated with a reduced risk for necrotizing enterocolitis surgery (group 1 vs group 3: 4.2 vs 2.6%, P=.028; change of strategy: 6.2 vs 4.0%, P<.001), any abdominal surgery, and hospital mortality. Infants treated with probiotics had improved weight gain/day, and probiotics had no effect on the risk of blood-culture confirmed sepsis. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis, probiotics were protective for necrotizing enterocolitis surgery (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37-0.91; P=.017), any abdominal surgery (OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.51-0.95; P=.02), and the combined outcome abdominal surgery and/or death (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.33-0.56; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our observational data support the use of Lactobacillus acidophilus/Bifidobacterium infantis probiotics to reduce the risk for gastrointestinal morbidity but not sepsis in very low birth weight infants.
TI  - Dahi containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum improves phagocytic potential of macrophages in aged mice.
AB  - The present study investigated the effect of Dahi containing potential probiotic  bacterial strains on macrophage functions in ageing mice. Probiotic Dahi was prepared by co-culturing Dahi bacteria (Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis biovar diacetylactis) along with Lactobacillus acidophilus LaVK2 (La-Dahi) or combined L. acidophilus LaVK2 and Bifidobacterium bifidum BbVK3 (LaBb-Dahi) in buffalo milk. The effect of ageing on phagocytic function was evaluated on 4 mo, 12 mo and 16 mo old mice. The effect of probiotic Dahi was evaluated for macrophage functions in ageing mice (12 mo old) fed La-Dahi or LaBb-Dahi supplements for 4 months. The production of extracellular superoxide and H2O2 declined in peritoneal macrophages but enhanced in splenic macrophages, while intracellular superoxide declined in both peritoneal and splenic macrophages with ageing in mice. A decline in phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophages was also observed in aged mice. Supplementation of diet with La-Dahi or LaBb-Dahi for 4 months improved production of reactive oxygen species and phagocytic and adherence indices of peritoneal macrophages in aged mice. These results suggest that oral administration of La-Dahi or LaBb-Dahi has potential to improve immune functions in ageing individuals.
TI  - [Tactics for the correction of intestinal microbiocenotic disorders in the combination therapy of patients with chronic liver diseases].
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of the symbiotic Linex used in the combination therapy of liver cirrhosis (LC). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Seventy-four patients with LC, including 44 who received additionally the symbiotic Linex and 30 who had conventional therapy, were examined. All the patients underwent clinical and biochemical blood tests, abdominal ultrasonography, fecal test for bacteria, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of the blood composition of microbial markers, number connecting test, and quality-of-life assessment (SF-36). RESULTS: The symbiotic-treated patients showed a significant improvement in biochemical parameters (decreases in transaminase activities, bilirubin levels, hepatic protein-synthetic function--there were elevations in the concentrations of total protein from 74.0 +/- 0.50 to 78.1 +/- 0.80 g/l (p < 0.05) and albumin from 30.6 +/- 1.7 to 35.5 +/- 1.6 g/l (p < 0.05). There were also increases in the count of bifidobacteria from 8.7 +/- 0.1 to 9.1 +/- 0.1 Ig CFU/g (p < 0.05), lactobacilli from 5.0 +/- 0.2 to 5.2 +/- 0.2 Ig CFU/g (p < 0.05) and in the total count of Escherichia coli from 7.6 +/- 0.3 to 7.9 +/- 0.3 Ig CFU/g (p < 0.05); a tendency for normalization of microbial markers was revealed by mass spectrometry; the manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy were alleviated (the number connecting test showed a reduction from 51.0 +/- 3.58 to 29.7 +/- 4.10 sec (p < 0.05)), and the quality of life improved. CONCLUSION: By normalizing enteric microbiocenosis, the symbiotic Linex positively affects the course and prognosis of LC and it is both a symptomatic and pathogenetic agent for the treatment of patients.
TI  - A food additive with prebiotic properties of an alpha-d-glucan from lactobacillus plantarum DM5.
AB  - An alpha-d-glucan produced by Lactobacillus plantarum DM5 was explored for in vitro prebiotic activities. Glucan-DM5 demonstrated 21.6% solubility, 316.9% water holding capacity, 86.2% flocculation activity, 71.4% emulsification activity and a degradation temperature (Td) of 292.2 degrees C. Glucan-DM5 exhibited lowest digestibility of 0.54% by artificial gastric juice, 0.21% by intestinal fluid and 0.32% by alpha-amylase whereas the standard prebiotic inulin, showed 25.23%, 5.97% and 19.13%, hydrolysis, respectively. Prebiotic activity assay of glucan-DM5 displayed increased growth of probiotic bacteria such as Bifidobacterium infantis and Lactobacillus acidophilus, but did not support the growth of non-probiotic bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes. The overall findings indicated that glucan from L. plantarum DM5 can serve as a potential prebiotic additive for food products.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus modulates the virulence of Clostridium difficile.
AB  - Clostridium difficile is a spore-forming, toxin-producing, anaerobic bacterium that colonizes the human gastrointestinal tract. This pathogen causes antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis in animals and humans. Antibiotic-associated diseases may be treated with probiotics, and interest is increasing in such uses of probiotics. This study investigated the effect of Lactobacillus strains on the quorum-sensing signals and toxin production of C. difficile. In addition, an in vivo experiment was designed to assess whether Lactobacillus acidophilus GP1B is able to control C. difficile-associated disease. Autoinducer-2 activity was measured for C. difficile using the Vibrio harveyi coupled bioluminescent assay. Cell extract (10mug/mL) of L. acidophilus GP1B exhibited the highest inhibitory activity among 5 to 40mug/mL cell-extract concentrations. Real-time PCR data indicated decreased transcriptional levels in luxS, tcdA, tcdB, and txeR genes in the presence of 10mug/mL of cell extract of L. acidophilus GP1B. Survival rates at 5d for mice given the pathogen alone with L. acidophilus GP1B cell extract or L. acidophilus GP1B were 10, 70, and 80%, respectively. In addition, the lactic acid-produced L. acidophilus GP1B exhibits an inhibitory effect against the growth of C. difficile. Both the L. acidophilus GP1B and GP1B cell extract have significant antipathogenic effects on C. difficile.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM affects colonic mucosal opioid receptor expression in patients with functional abdominal pain - a randomised clinical study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In a recent double-blinded clinical trial, the probiotic combination  of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM (L-NCFM) and B-LBi07 reduced bloating symptoms in patients with functional bowel disorders; an effect more evident in those who reported abdominal pain. In mice, L-NCFM but not B-LBi07 induced colonic mu-opioid receptor (MOR) and cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) expression, and reduced visceral sensitivity. AIMS: To determine if L-NCFM was the active component in the clinical trial and to investigate the mechanism of action in humans with mild to moderate abdominal pain. METHODS: Caucasian women (n = 20) 18-70 years with mild to moderate abdominal pain were enrolled in a double-blind, two-armed, single-centre study. Patients were given either L-NCFM alone or in combination with B-LBi07 for 21 days at a total dose of 2 x 10(10) CFU b.d. Colonic biopsies were collected during unsedated, unprepped flexible sigmoidoscopy before and at the end of probiotic consumption. mRNA and immunostaining were then performed on these biopsies. Patients kept symptom diaries for the 7 days prior to starting probiotic therapy and for the last 7 days of therapy. RESULTS: L-NCFM alone, but not with B-LBi07, induced colonic MOR mRNA and protein expression, as well as downstream signalling, as measured by enterocyte STAT3-phosphorylation. In contrast, CB2 expression was decreased. Both treatment groups trended towards improvement in symptoms, but the study was insufficiently powered to draw meaningful conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM modulates mu-opioid receptor expression and activity, while the combination of L-NCFM and B-LBi07 does not. This study provides a possible mechanism for action by which probiotics modulates pain sensation in humans (Clinical Trial Number: NCT01064661).
TI  - Characterization of the most abundant Lactobacillus species in chicken gastrointestinal tract and potential use as probiotics for genetic engineering.
AB  - The count and diffusion of Lactobacilli species in the different gastrointestinal tract (GI) regions of broilers were investigated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the probiotic characteristics of six L. reuteri species isolated from broilers' GI tract were also investigated to obtain the potential target for genetic engineering. Lactobacilli had the highest diversity in the crop and the lowest one in the cecum. Compared with the lower GI tract, more Lactobacilli were found in the upper GI tract. Lactobacillus reuteri, L. johnsonii, L. acidophilus, L. crispatus, L. salivarius, and L. aviarius were the predominant Lactobacillus species and present throughout the GI tract of chickens. Lactobacillus reuteri was the most abundant Lactobacillus species. Lactobacillus reuteri XC1 had good probiotic characteristics that would be a potential and desirable target for genetic engineering.
TI  - Viable intestinal passage of a canine jejunal commensal strain Lactobacillus acidophilus LAB20 in dogs.
AB  - The strain Lactobacillus acidophilus LAB20 with immunomodulatory properties was previously found dominant in the jejunal chyme of four dogs, and the novel surface layer protein of LAB20 suggested its competitive colonization in canine gut. To evaluate the persistence and survival of LAB20 in healthy dogs, LAB20 was fed to five healthy pet dogs for 3 days, at a dosage of 10(8) CFU daily as fermented milk supplement. The fecal samples, from 1 day prior to feeding, three continuous feeding days, and on day 5, 7, 14, and 21, were collected for strain-specific detection of LAB20 using real-time PCR. We found that LAB20 count was significantly increased in dog fecal samples at the second feeding day, but rapidly decreased after feeding ceased. The fecal samples from prior to feeding, during feeding, and post-cessation days were plated onto mLBS7 agar, from where LAB20 was recovered and distinguishable from other fecal lactobacilli based on its colony morphotype. Using strain-specific PCR detection, the colonies were further verified as LAB20 indicating that LAB20 can survive through the passage of the canine intestine. This study suggested that canine-derived strain LAB20 maintained at high numbers during feeding, viably transited through the dog gut, and could be identified based on its colony morphotype.
TI  - Development of an integration mutagenesis system in Lactobacillus gasseri.
AB  - Lactobacillus gasseri ATCC 33323 is a member of the acidophilus-complex group, microbes of human origin with significant potential for impacting human health based on niche-specific traits. In order to facilitate functional analysis of this important species, a upp-based counterselective chromosomal integration system was established and employed for targeting the lipoteichoic acid (LTA) synthesis gene, ltaS, in L. gasseri ATCC 33323. The ltaS gene encodes a phosphoglycerol transferase responsible for building the glycerol chain of LTA. No isogenic mutant bearing the deletion genotype was recovered, but an integration knockout mutant was generated with insertion inactivation at the ltaS locus. The ltaS deficient derivative exhibited an altered cellular morphology and significantly reduced ability to adhere to Caco-2 intestinal cell monolayers, relative to the wild-type parent strain.
TI  - An investigation of the effect of scaling-induced surface roughness on bacterial  adhesion in common fixed dental restorative materials.
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Bacterial plaque must be routinely removed from teeth, adjacent structures, and prostheses. However, the removal of this plaque can inadvertently increase the risk of future bacterial adhesion. PURPOSE: The purpose of this investigation was to assess the change in the surface roughness of 3 different surfaces after dental prophylactic instrumentation and how this influenced bacterial adhesion. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty specimens each of Type III gold alloy, lithium disilicate, and zirconia were fabricated in the same dimensions. The specimens were divided into 4 groups: ultrasonic scaler, stainless steel curette, prophylaxis cup, and control. Pretreatment surface roughness measurements were made with a profilometer. Surface treatments in each group were performed with a custom mechanical scaler. Posttreatment surface roughness values were measured. In turn, the specimens were inoculated with Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Actinomyces viscosus. Bacterial adhesion was assessed by rinsing the specimens with sterile saline to remove unattached cells. The specimens were then placed in sterile tubes with 1 mL of sterile saline. The solution was plated and quantified. Scanning electron microscopy was performed. The statistical analysis of surface roughness was completed by using repeated-measures single-factor ANOVA with a Bonferroni correction. RESULTS: The surface roughness values for gold alloy specimens increased as a result of prophylaxis cup treatment (0.221 to 0.346 Ra) (P<.01) and stainless steel curette treatment (0.264 to 1.835 Ra) (P<.01). The results for bacterial adhesion to gold alloy proved inconclusive. A quantitative comparison indicated no statistically significant differences in pretreatment and posttreatment surface roughness values for lithium disilicate and zirconia specimens. In spite of these similarities, the overall bacterial adherence values for lithium disilicate were significantly greater than those recorded for gold alloy or zirconia (P<.05). Instrumentation of the lithium disilicate and zirconia with the stainless steel curette significantly increased bacterial adhesion compared with the control (P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this investigation indicate that Type III gold alloy exhibited increased surface roughness values after stainless steel curette and prophylaxis cup treatments. Zirconia was less susceptible to bacterial adhesion than lithium disilicate, and greater bacterial adhesion was found for the stainless steel curette than the other instrumentation methods.
TI  - Glutamine-supplemented parenteral nutrition and probiotics in four adult autoimmune enteropathy patients.
AB  - To evaluate the effects of glutamine-supplemented parenteral nutrition (PN) and probiotics in adult autoimmune enteropathy (AIE) patients. Four adult AIE patients were identified from April 2006 to January 2012. Clinical and nutritional data were obtained from the patients' medical records. Glutamine-supplemented PN started immediately when the AIE diagnosis was confirmed. The total PN duration was 351 days. According to the PN prescription, the average caloric intake ranged from 20 to 25 kcal/kg/day, and the protein intake ranged from 1.2 to 1.5 g/kg/day. Alanyl-glutamine (20 g/day) was administered to AIE patients for 4 weeks followed by a 2-week break, and this treatment schedule was repeated when PN lasted for more than 6 weeks. Body weight gain and an increased serum albumin level were achieved after PN, and defecation frequency and quality also improved. Each patient received oral supplements, 250 mL of Ensure and two probiotics capsules (each capsule containing 0.5x108 colonies) three times a day when enteral nutrition started. Three AIE patients were successfully weaned off PN, and one patient died of pneumonia. Glutamine-supplemented PN and probiotics show promise in managing patients with AIE and related malnutrition.
TI  - Probiotic potential and biotherapeutic effects of newly isolated vaginal Lactobacillus acidophilus 36YL strain on cancer cells.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus is categorized as a probiotic strain because of its beneficial effects in human health and prevention of disease transmission. This study is aimed to characterize the probiotic potential of L. acidophilus 36YL originally isolated from the vagina of healthy and fertile Iranian women. The L. acidophilus 36YL strain was identified using 16S rDNA gene sequencing and characterized by biochemical methodologies, such as antibiotics susceptibility, antimicrobial activity, and acid and bile resistance. The bioactivity of the secretion of this strain on four human cancer cell lines (AGS, HeLa, MCF-7, and HT-29) and one normal cell line (HUVEC) was evaluated by cytotoxicity assay and apoptosis analysis. This newly isolated strain was found to exhibit notable probiotic properties, such as admirable antibiotic susceptibility, good antimicrobial activity, and favorable resistance to acid and bile salt. The results of bioactivity assessment demonstrated acceptable anticancer effects on the four tested cancer cell lines and negligible side effects on the assayed normal cell line. Our findings revealed that the anticancer effect of L. acidophilus 36YL strain secretions depends on the induction of apoptosis in cancer cells. L. acidophilus 36YL strain is considered as a nutraceutical alternative or a topical medication with a potential therapeutic index because of the absence of cytotoxicity to normal cells, but effective toxicity to cancer cell lines.
TI  - Effects of probiotics on the growth performance and intestinal micro flora of broiler chickens.
AB  - Antibiotics have been used in poultry industry for decades to promote growth and  protect animals from diseases, followed by various side effects. In efforts of searching for a better alternative, probiotic is of extensive attention. We investigated the effects of Bacillus subtitles, Rhodopseudomonas palustris, Candida utilis and Lactobacillus acidophilus as 0.1% (W/W) feed additives on broiler growth performance and intestinal microflora. The results showed the probiotics treatments significantly improved growth of broilers. Broilers supplemented with B. subtilis and L. acidophilus weighed 18.4% and 10.1% more than birds in control group at 42 days of age. Furthermore the feed conversion ratios of the birds in the two groups were also improved, decreasing 9.1% and 12.9%, respectively. Further study indicated a significant increase of cecal Lactobacilli concentration in briolers supplemented with probiotics, expecially in L. acidophilus treatment group. Meanwhile, the count of cecal Actinomyces in birds treated with probiotics was significantly lower compared with the control group. In conclusion, probiotics such as B. subtitles and L. acidophilus are good alternatives to antibiotics in promoting growth resulting from a beneficial modulation of the intestinal micro flora, which leads to increased efficiency of intestinal digestion in the host animal.
TI  - Molecular detection of bacteria associated to dental caries in 4-12-year-old Tunisian children.
AB  - The occurrence of several microbial species in the oral cavity of 4-12-year-old Tunisian children was investigated. Samples were taken from 158 children (81 caries actives and 77 caries free). Genomic DNA was extracted and analyzed for the presence of 17 microbial species using a polymerase chain reaction assay. All samples were positive for at least one of the target microbial strains. Streptococcus mutans was the most prevalent species (76.5%) detected in genomic DNA collected from carious lesions. Other prevalent species were Candida spp (63%), Streptococcus salivarius (59%) and Streptococcus oralis (42%). The frequency of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus casei-group in caries lesions was 29.5%, 34.5% and 22% respectively. Pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus was found in 28.5% of carious lesion samples compared to 15.5% in the control. Frequency of Porphyromonas endodontali, Actinomyces radicidentis and Treponema denticola recovery did not differ significantly between origins of samples. PCR analysis of genomic DNA detect various oral bacteria that differ between caries actives and caries-free children. In addition, the association of same aciduric bacteria (S. mutans, S. salivarius, L. acidophilus) and caries formation was noticed.
TI  - Application of Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA 5) strain in fruit-based ice cream.
AB  - A study was performed to apply a probiotic strain into fermented ice cream mix with suitable fruit bases to develop a value-added product with a substantial level of viable organisms for a sufficient shelf life. Pure direct vat strain culture of Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA 5) in freeze-dried form was inoculated into a mixture of ice cream, frozen, and the number of viable organisms during frozen storage for a period of time was enumerated, using turbidity measurements with a spectrophotometer. An ice cream sample prepared without the probiotic culture was compared with the test sample for quality, by testing the basic quality parameters for ice cream. Results show a reduction in the over run of the probiotic ice cream compared to the nonprobiotic ice cream. Significantly high level (P < 0.05) of total solids (42%), proteins (16.5%), and titratable acidity (2.2%) was observed in the test sample compared to the nonprobiotic ice cream. Significantly low pH level in the probiotic sample may be due to the lactic acid produced by the probiotic culture. No significant difference (P > 0.05) in the fat content in the two types of ice cream was observed. A significantly low level (P < 0.05) of melting in the probiotic one may have resulted from less over run, than the nonprobiotic sample. Rapid reduction in the viable cells during frozen storage occurred at -18 degrees C and gradual adaptation occurred over the first 4 weeks. At the 10th week, 1.0 x 10(7) numbers of viable organisms were present in 1 g of the probiotic ice cream. Results show the presence of a sufficient number of viable organisms in the product for the 10-week period, which would be beneficial to consumers.
TI  - The inhibitory effect of a fermented papaya preparation on growth, hydrophobicity, and acid production of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, and Lactobacillus acidophilus: its implications in oral health improvement of diabetics.
AB  - Fermented papaya preparation (FPP) is a "natural health product." The high incidence of dental caries, gingivitis, periodontitis, and oral microbial infection cases among patients with diabetes mellitus continues to prevail. The potential role of FPP against common oral microbiota (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, and Lactobacillus acidophilus) isolated from the human oral cavity was investigated using in vitro simulation models of dental plaque and caries. FPP showed an inhibitory effect against the growth (at 0.05 mg/mL: S. mutans: -6.9%; S. mitis: -4.47%, P < 0.05), acid production (at 0.05 mg/mL: S. mutans: +6.38%; L. acidophilus: +2.25%), and hydrophobicity (at 50 mg/mL: S. mutans: 1.01%, P < 0.01; S. mitis: 7.66%, P < 0.05) of tested microbiota. The results of this study suggest that low doses of FPP may be a suitable complement to good oral hygiene practice for the effective prevention of dental caries, plaque, and gingivitis. The functional application of FPP as a constituent of a balanced diet and active lifestyle can make a positive contribution to the oral health status and well-being of patients with diabetes.
TI  - Gastrointestinal microbes interact with canine adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells in vitro and enhance immunomodulatory functions.
AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are somatic, multipotent stromal cells with potent  immunomodulatory and regenerative properties. Although MSCs have pattern recognition receptors and are modulated by Toll-like receptor ligands, MSC-microbial interactions are poorly defined. The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of bacterial association on MSC function. We hypothesized that gastrointestinal bacteria associate with MSCs and alter their immunomodulatory properties. The effect of MSC-microbial interactions on MSC morphology, viability, proliferation, migration, and immunomodulatory functions was investigated. MSCs associated with a remarkable array of enteric pathogens and commensal bacteria. MSC interactions with two model organisms, the pathogen Salmonella typhimurium and the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus, were further investigated. While ST readily invaded MSCs, LB adhered to the MSC plasma membrane. Neither microbe induced MSC death, degeneration, or diminished proliferation. Microbial association did not upregulate MHC-II, CD80/86, or CD1 expression. MSC-microbial interaction significantly increased transcription of key immunomodulatory genes, including COX2, IL6, and IL8, coupled with significantly increased prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), interleukin (IL)6, and IL8 secretion. MSC-ST coincubation resulted in increased MSC expression of CD54, and significant augmentation of MSC inhibition of mitogen-induced T-cell proliferation. T-cell proliferation was partially restored when PGE2 secretion was blocked from ST-primed MSCs. MSC-microbe interactions have a profound effect on MSC function and may be pivotal in a variety of clinical settings where MSCs are being explored as potential therapeutics in the context of microbial communities, such as Crohn's disease, chronic nonhealing wounds, and sepsis.
TI  - Egg quality and productive performance of laying hens fed different levels of skimmed milk powder added to a diet containing Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - The current trial was carried out on a commercial poultry farm to study the effect of skim milk powder (SMP) added to a diet containing Lactobacillus acidophilus on performance and egg quality of laying hens from 20 to 49 wk of age. A total of 2,400 Hy-Line W-36 laying hens were housed in 600 unenriched cages (4 hens each) located over 4 tier levels. Animals were assigned to 1 of 3 experimental treatments (0, 3, and 4). The laying hens assigned to treatments 3 and 4 received a diet enriched respectively with 3 and 4% SMP, whereas the animals in treatment 0 were fed a diet without SMP. All diets, moreover, were supplemented with L. acidophilus D2/CSL. Hen performance was determined throughout the experimental period and egg quality was measured on 30 eggs per treatment every week. Results showed that productive performance in terms of egg production, egg weight, and feed conversion ratio was not influenced by SMP at 3 or 4% of the diet. Egg quality was significantly affected by SMP included at 3 or 4% of the diet. Eggs from treatments 3 and 4, in fact, displayed higher shell thickness than those from treatment 0 (P < 0.0001). Likewise, specific gravity, Haugh unit, and shell percentage were significantly affected by the addition of SMP. In conclusion, in our study, SMP added to a diet containing L. acidophilus had no significant effects on the productive parameters of hens during the laying period, whereas significant improvements were found in certain egg quality characteristics.
TI  - A double blind randomized trial showing probiotics to be ineffective in acute diarrhea in Indonesian children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of probiotics added to oral rehydration solution and zinc in the treatment of acute infectious diarrhea in Indonesian children. METHODS: A prospective randomized double blind placebo-controlled trial was performed to test the efficacy of a probiotic food supplement in 112 children in the Kenari subdistrict, central Jakarta, aged 6-36 mo with acute infectious diarrhea and moderate dehydration. The supplemented group was given standard therapy (oral rehydration solution and zinc) and the probiotic strains Lactobacillus (L.) rhamnosus R0011 1.9 x 10(9) colony forming units (cfu) and L. acidophilus R0052 0.1 x 10(9) cfu/d for 7 d, while the control group was given standard therapy and placebo. RESULTS: Median duration of diarrhea was 68.5 h (range 13-165) in the supplemented and 61.5 h (range 21-166) in the control group (P = 0.596). Median daily frequency of defecation until diarrhea stopped was 5.0 in the supplemented vs. 5.5 in the control group (P = 0.795). CONCLUSIONS: This probiotic food supplement tested did not reduce the duration of acute infectious diarrhea as compared to oral rehydration and zinc.
TI  - Randomised placebo-controlled double blind multicentric trial on efficacy and safety of Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 and Bifidobacterium BB-12 for prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of a probiotic formulation containing Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 and Bifidobacterium BB-12 in the prevention of antibiotic associated diarrhoea (AAD). METHODS AND MATERIAL: A double-blind randomised placebo controlled multicentric trial was conducted in adults who were prescribed a seven-day course of oral antibiotic (either cefadroxil or amoxycillin) for a documented indication. The effectiveness of a 14-day therapy (concomitant with antibiotic course and seven days thereafter) of the probiotic formulation in preventing AAD was evaluated. Safety profile was assessed by monitoring of all treatment emergent adverse events and tolerability on a global well being scale. RESULTS: The incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 10.8% compared to 15.6% in the placebo group, the difference being statistically non-significant (p = 0.19). The relative risk for AAD was 0.7 with the 95% CI being 0.4 to 1.2. The diarrhoea duration in the probiotic group was two days with an interquartile range of 1- 3 days and was significantly less (p = 0.01) than the placebo group which was four days with an interquartile range of 3 - 5.5 days. Subgroup analysis of subjects with AAD showed that the incidence of severe diarrhoea (watery stools) was 96% in the placebo group (25 out of 26) compared to 31.6% (6 out of 19) in the probiotic group and this difference was significant statistically (p < 0.001). Four mild, non-serious, adverse events were detected (2.0%) in the probiotic group but there were none in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: This randomised controlled trial shows that prophylactic administration of the probiotic formulation containing Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 and Bifidobacterium BB-12, did not effectively lower the incidence of AAD in adults. However, compared to placebo the duration of diarrhoea in the probiotic group was significantly reduced. Its tolerability and safety profile were good.
TI  - Comparative determination of two probiotics by QCM and OWLS-based immunosensors.
AB  - The regular consumption of foods containing probiotic bacteria has beneficial physiological effects on the health and the digestion system. There is a need for novel analytical approaches for the determination of these bacteria that are faster than the classical plate counting method. For this purpose, two label-free biosensors were investigated and presented in this paper: Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) and Optical Waveguide Lightmode Spectroscopy (OWLS) based direct immunosensors were developed for real-time direct detection of probiotic bacteria in fermented dairy products. Bifidobacterium bifidum O1356 and Lactobacillus acidophilus O1132 were detected by polyclonal anti-B. bifidum IgG and anti-L. acidophilus IgG immobilized on the sensors' surface. Sulfo-LC-SPDP cross linking agent was used to bind antibodies to the gold surface of the QCM's AT-cut quartz wafer. Concerning OWLS, antibodies were covalently bound to the amino groups of the silanized surface of the waveguide by glutaraldehyde. The dynamic measuring range was found between 1.0E+3 and 5.0E+5CFUmL(-1) in 100 fold diluted fermented milk products by QCM and with OWLS. Considering the current legislation of the probiotic content in probiotic products, the two developed immunosensors can be applied for rapid quantification of L. acidophilus and B. bifidum in fermented milk. These examinations offer effective alternatives to the microbiological plate counting method.
TI  - The use of direct-fed microbials to reduce shedding of Escherichia coli O157 in beef cattle: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
AB  - Human illness due to infections with Escherichia coli O157 is a serious health concern. Infection occurs through direct contact with infected animals or their faeces, through contaminated food or water and/or through person-to-person transmission. A reduction in faecal E. coli O157 shedding in cattle might reduce the burden of human infections. We used systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of direct-fed microbials (DFM), compared with placebo or no treatment, fed during the pre-harvest stage of production in reducing faecal E. coli O157 shedding in beef cattle during field trials. Four electronic databases, Nebraska Beef Reports and review article reference lists were searched. A total of 16 publications assessing faecal shedding at the end of the trial and/or throughout the trial period were included. The majority of publicly disseminated trials evaluated the prevalence of E. coli O157 faecal shedding; only two evaluated the concentration of organisms in faeces. The prevalence of faecal E. coli O157 shedding in cattle is significantly reduced by DFM treatments (summary effect size for all DFM - OR = 0.46; CI = 0.36-0.60). The DFM combination Lactobacillus acidophilus (NP51) and Propionibacterium freudenreichii (NP24) was more efficacious in reducing the prevalence of faecal E. coli O157 shedding at the time of harvest and throughout the trial period compared with the group of other DFM, although this difference was not statistically significant. Furthermore, we found that the combination [NP51 and NP24] treatment was more efficacious in reducing the prevalence of faecal E. coli O157 shedding at the time of harvest and throughout the trial period when fed at the dose of 10(9) CFU/animal/day than any lesser amount, although this difference was not statistically significant. Feeding beef cattle DFM during the pre-harvest stage of production reduces the prevalence of E. coli O157 faecal shedding and might effectively reduce human infections.
TI  - Microencapsulation of NCIMB 701748 in matrices containing soluble fibre by spray  drying: Technological characterization, storage stability and survival after digestion.
AB  - We evaluated sodium alginate, chitosan and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) as co-encapsulants for spray dried Lactobacillus acidophilus NCIMB 701748 by assessing their impact on cell viability and physicochemical properties of the dried powders, viability over 35 days of storage at 25 degrees C and survival after simulated digestion. Fibres were added to a control carrier medium containing whey protein concentrate, d-glucose and maltodextrin. Sodium alginate and HPMC did not affect cell viability but chitosan reduced viable counts in spray dried powders, as compared to the control. Although chitosan caused large losses of viability during spray-drying, these losses were counteracted by the excellent storage stability compared to control, sodium alginate and HPMC, and the overall effect became positive after the 35-day storage. Chitosan also improved survival rates in simulated GI conditions, however no single fibre could improve L. acidophilus NCIMB 701748 viability in all steps from production through storage and digestion.
TI  - Probiotic viability and storage stability of yogurts and fermented milks prepared with several mixtures of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Currently, the food industry wants to expand the range of probiotic yogurts but each probiotic bacteria offers different and specific health benefits. Little information exists on the influence of probiotic strains on physicochemical properties and sensory characteristics of yogurts and fermented milks. Six probiotic yogurts or fermented milks and 1 control yogurt were prepared, and we evaluated several physicochemical properties (pH, titratable acidity, texture, color, and syneresis), microbial viability of starter cultures (Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus) and probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus reuteri) during fermentation and storage (35 d at 5 degrees C), as well as sensory preference among them. Decreases in pH (0.17 to 0.50 units) and increases in titratable acidity (0.09 to 0.29%) were observed during storage. Only the yogurt with S. thermophilus, L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and L. reuteri differed in firmness. No differences in adhesiveness were determined among the tested yogurts, fermented milks, and the control. Syneresis was in the range of 45 to 58%. No changes in color during storage were observed and no color differences were detected among the evaluated fermented milk products. Counts of S. thermophilus decreased from 1.8 to 3.5 log during storage. Counts of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus also decreased in probiotic yogurts and varied from 30 to 50% of initial population. Probiotic bacteria also lost viability throughout storage, although the 3 probiotic fermented milks maintained counts >/= 10(7)cfu/mL for 3 wk. Probiotic bacteria had variable viability in yogurts, maintaining counts of L. acidophilus >/= 10(7) cfu/mL for 35 d, of L. casei for 7d, and of L. reuteri for 14 d. We found no significant sensory preference among the 6 probiotic yogurts and fermented milks or the control. However, the yogurt and fermented milk made with L. casei were better accepted. This study presents relevant information on physicochemical, sensory, and microbial properties of probiotic yogurts and fermented milks, which could guide the dairy industry in developing new probiotic products.
TI  - Effect of Aloe vera (Aloe barbadensis Miller) on survivability, extent of proteolysis and ACE inhibition of potential probiotic cultures in fermented milk.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the present investigation, the effect of Aloe vera gel powder on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity, extent of proteolysis during fermentation and survival of Lactobacillus casei NCDC19 during storage of fermented milk was studied. RESULTS: Among the different cultures screened for ACE inhibitory activity, Lactobacillus casei NCDC 19 exhibited the highest ACE inhibition (approx. 40%) as well as extent of proteolysis (0.37, Abs(3)(4)(0)). In the presence of Aloe vera (0.5% and 1% w/v) an increase in extent of proteolysis (0.460 +/- 0.047 and 0.480 +/- 0.027) and percent ACE inhibitory activity (44.32 +/- 2.83 and 47.52 +/- 1.83) was observed in comparison to control. Aloe vera powder addition also led to an increase in viable counts (>11 log cfu mL(-)(1)) of L. casei NCDC 19 in fermented milk during storage for 7 days and the counts were maintained in sufficiently higher numbers. CONCLUSION: The study suggests Aloe vera to be a good functional ingredient which can be further explored for different health attributes.
TI  - Lactobacillus amylovorus inhibits the TLR4 inflammatory signaling triggered by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli via modulation of the negative regulators and involvement of TLR2 in intestinal Caco-2 cells and pig explants.
AB  - Inflammation derived from pathogen infection involves the activation of toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. Despite the established immunomodulatory activities of probiotics, studies relating the ability of such bacteria to inhibit the TLR signaling pathways are limited or controversial. In a previous study we showed that Lactobacillus amylovorus DSM 16698T, a novel lactobacillus isolated from unweaned pigs, protects the intestinal cells from enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) K88 infection through cytokine regulation. In the present study we investigated whether the ability of L. amylovorus to counteract the inflammatory status triggered by ETEC in intestine is elicited through inhibition of the TLR4 signaling pathway. We used the human intestinal Caco-2/TC7 cells and intestinal explants isolated from 5 week-old crossbreed Pietrain/Duroc/Large-White piglets, treated with ETEC, L. amylovorus or L. amylovorus cell free supernatant, either alone or simultaneously with ETEC. Western blot analysis showed that L. amylovorus and its cell free supernatant suppress the activation of the different steps of TLR4 signaling in Caco-2/TC7 cells and pig explants, by inhibiting the ETEC induced increase in the level of TLR4 and MyD88, the phosphorylation of the IKKalpha, IKKbeta, IkappaBalpha and NF-kappaB subunit p65, as well as the over-production of inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and IL-1beta. The immunofluorescence analysis confirms the lack of phospho-p65 translocation into the nucleus. These anti-inflammatory effects are achieved through modulation of the negative regulators Tollip and IRAK-M. We also found that L. amylovorus blocks the up-regulation of the extracellular heat shock protein (Hsp)72 and Hsp90, that are critical for TLR4 function. By using anti-TLR2 antibody, we demonstrate that TLR2 is required for the suppression of TLR4 signaling activation. These results may contribute to develop therapeutic interventions using L. amylovorus in intestinal disorders of piglets and humans.
TI  - Irritable eye syndrome: neuroimmune mechanisms and benefits of selected nutrients.
AB  - Previous studies showed comorbidity of some ocular, enteral, and affective symptoms comprising irritable eye syndrome. Aims of the present study were to learn more about the pathogenic mechanisms of this syndrome and to evaluate benefits of food supplements on these disorders. In in vitro assay, Lactobacillus acidophilus lysate inhibited interleukin (IL)-1beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha generation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages in dose- and size-dependent manner. For a prospective, open-label phase I/II controlled clinical trial, 40 subjects affected by ocular dysesthesia and hyperesthesia and comorbid enteral and anxiety-depression symptoms were randomly assigned either into the treated group, which received a composition containing probiotic lysate, vitamins A, B, and D and omega 3 fatty acids, or into the control group, which received vitamins and omega 3 fatty acids. For reference, 20 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects were also selected. White blood count (WBC) and lymphocyte and monocyte counts, as well as IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels, were significantly above the reference levels in both treated and control groups. After 8 weeks, WBC and lymphocyte and monocyte counts, and cytokine levels significantly decreased, and ocular, enteral, and anxiety-depression symptoms significantly improved in the treated group as compared to the control group. This proof-of-concept study suggested that subclinical inflammation may be a common mechanism connecting ocular, enteral, and anxiety/depression symptoms, and supplements affecting dysbiosis may be a new approach to treating this syndrome.
TI  - Ultra-low-dose estriol and Lactobacillus acidophilus vaginal tablets (Gynoflor((R))) for vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal breast cancer patients on aromatase inhibitors: pharmacokinetic, safety, and efficacy phase I clinical study.
AB  - Phase I pharmacokinetic (PK) study assessed circulating estrogens in breast cancer (BC) patients on a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) with vaginal atrophy using vaginal ultra-low-dose 0.03 mg estriol (E3) and Lactobacillus combination vaginal tablets (Gynoflor((R))). 16 women on NSAI with severe vaginal atrophy applied a daily vaginal tablet of Gynoflor((R)) for 28 days followed by a maintenance therapy of 3 tablets weekly for 8 weeks. Primary outcomes were serum concentrations and PK of E3, estradiol (E2), and estrone (E1) using highly sensitive gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Secondary outcomes were clinical measures for efficacy and side effects; microscopic changes in vaginal epithelium and microflora; and changes in serum FSH, LH, and sex hormone-binding globulin. Compared with baseline, serum E1 and E2 did not increase in any of the women at any time following vaginal application. Serum E3 transiently increased after the first application in 15 of 16 women, with a maximum of 168 pg/ml 2-3 h post-insertion. After 4 weeks, serum E3 was slightly increased in 8 women with a maximum of 44 pg/ml. The vaginal atrophy resolved or improved in all women. The product was well tolerated, and discontinuation of therapy was not observed. The low-dose 0.03 mg E3 and Lactobacillus acidophilus vaginal tablets application in postmenopausal BC patients during AI treatment suffering from vaginal atrophy lead to small and transient increases in serum E3, but not E1 or E2, and therefore can be considered as safe and efficacious for treatment of atrophic vaginitis in BC patients taking NSAIs.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM affects vitamin E acetate metabolism and intestinal bile acid signature in monocolonized mice.
AB  - Monocolonization of germ-free (GF) mice enables the study of specific bacterial species in vivo. Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM(TM) (NCFM) is a probiotic strain; however, many of the mechanisms behind its health-promoting effect remain unknown. Here, we studied the effects of NCFM on the metabolome of jejunum, cecum, and colon of NCFM monocolonized (MC) and GF mice using liquid chromatography coupled to mass-spectrometry (LC-MS). The study adds to existing evidence that NCFM in vivo affects the bile acid signature of mice, in particular by deconjugation. Furthermore, we confirmed that carbohydrate metabolism is affected by NCFM in the mouse intestine as especially the digestion of oligosaccharides (penta- and tetrasaccharides) was increased in MC mice. Additionally, levels of alpha-tocopherol acetate (vitamin E acetate) were higher in the intestine of GF mice than in MC mice, suggesting that NCFM affects the vitamin E acetate metabolism. NCFM did not digest vitamin E acetate in vitro, suggesting that direct bacterial metabolism was not the cause of the altered metabolome in vivo. Taken together, our results suggest that NCFM affects intestinal carbohydrate metabolism, bile acid metabolism and vitamin E metabolism, although it remains to be investigated whether this effect is unique to NCFM.
TI  - Short communication: incorporation of inulin and transglutaminase in fermented goat milk containing probiotic bacteria.
AB  - Goat milk is a good carrier for probiotic bacteria; however, it is difficult to produce fermented goat milk with a consistency comparable to that of fermented cow milks. It can be improved by the addition of functional stabilizers, such as inulin, or treatment with transglutaminase. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of cold storage of inulin and microbial transglutaminase on the viability of Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 and Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis Bb-12 in fermented goat milk. Microbiological analysis included the determination of the probiotic bacteria cell count in fermented milk samples, whereas physico-chemical analysis included the analysis of fat content, titratable acidity, and pH of raw, pasteurized, and fermented goat milk samples. No positive influence of inulin or microbial transglutaminase on the viability of probiotics in fermented goat's milk samples was observed. Nevertheless, the population of probiotics remained above 6 log cfu/g after 8 wk of storage at 5 degrees C.
TI  - Anti-infective activities of lactobacillus strains in the human intestinal microbiota: from probiotics to gastrointestinal anti-infectious biotherapeutic agents.
AB  - A vast and diverse array of microbial species displaying great phylogenic, genomic, and metabolic diversity have colonized the gastrointestinal tract. Resident microbes play a beneficial role by regulating the intestinal immune system, stimulating the maturation of host tissues, and playing a variety of roles in nutrition and in host resistance to gastric and enteric bacterial pathogens. The mechanisms by which the resident microbial species combat gastrointestinal pathogens are complex and include competitive metabolic interactions and the production of antimicrobial molecules. The human intestinal microbiota is a source from which Lactobacillus probiotic strains have often been isolated. Only six probiotic Lactobacillus strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, i.e., L. rhamnosus GG, L. casei Shirota YIT9029, L. casei DN-114 001, L. johnsonii NCC 533, L. acidophilus LB, and L. reuteri DSM 17938, have been well characterized with regard to their potential antimicrobial effects against the major gastric and enteric bacterial pathogens and rotavirus. In this review, we describe the current knowledge concerning the experimental antibacterial activities, including antibiotic-like and cell-regulating activities, and therapeutic effects demonstrated in well-conducted, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials of these probiotic Lactobacillus strains. What is known about the antimicrobial activities supported by the molecules secreted by such probiotic Lactobacillus strains suggests that they constitute a promising new source for the development of innovative anti-infectious agents that act luminally and intracellularly in the gastrointestinal tract.
TI  - Lactose digestion from yogurt: mechanism and relevance.
AB  - Yogurt is traditionally consumed throughout the world among populations who are seemingly unable to digest lactose. This review provides a historical overview of the studies that show lactose digestion and tolerance from yogurt by lactose-intolerant people. The lactose in yogurt is digested more efficiently than other dairy sources of lactose because the bacteria inherent in yogurt assist with its digestion. The bacterial lactase survives the acidic conditions of the stomach, apparently being physically protected within the bacterial cells and facilitated by the buffering capacity of yogurt. The increasing pH as the yogurt enters the small intestine and a slower gastrointestinal transit time allow the bacterial lactase to be active, digesting lactose from yogurt sufficiently to prevent symptoms in lactose-intolerant people. There is little difference in the lactase capability of different commercial yogurts, because they apparently contain Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus in sufficient quantities (10(8) bacteria/mL). However, Lactobacillus acidophilus appears to require cell membrane disruption to physically release the lactase. Compared with unflavored yogurts, flavored yogurts appear to exhibit somewhat reduced lactase activity but are still well tolerated.
TI  - Some probiotic and antibacterial properties of Lactobacillus acidophilus cultured from dahi a native milk product.
AB  - In this study, different strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus from dahi were analyzed for certain probiotic and antibacterial properties. Initially, these strains were confirmed by the amplification of 16S rRNA regions and then screened for antibacterial activities against food borne pathogens. The phenotypic relationship between apparent antibacterial activity and cell wall proteins were established by cluster analysis. It was observed that those strains, which have prominent bands having size 22-25 kDa possess antibacterial activity. On the basis of wide spectrum of killing pattern, a strain LA06FT was further characterized that showed no change in its behavior when subjected to the antibiotic protected environment and grow well in acid-bile conditions. The bacteriocin produced by this strain has specific antibacterial activity of 5369.13 AU mg(-1). It remained stable at 60-90 degrees C and pH range of 4.5-6.5 while proteolytic enzymes inactivate the bacteriocin that confirm its proteinic nature having molecular weight of </=8.5 kDa.
TI  - Preservative effect of food-based fermentate from Lactobacillus acidophilus NX2-6 on chilled pork patties.
AB  - The food-based fermentate (FBF) from Lactobacillus acidophilus NX2-6 has a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity but has not previously been reported as a food preservative. Experiments were conducted to assess its application as a preservative in pork patties. The effect of freeze-dried FBF on the microbiological parameters, physicochemical changes, and sensory evaluations of chilled pork patties stored for 15 days at 4 degrees C was investigated. The five treatments evaluated included a control (meat only), nisin (meat plus 0.5% nisin), L.1 (meat plus 2% freeze-dried FBF), L.2 (meat plus 4% freeze-dried FBF), and L.3 (meat plus 8% freeze-dried FBF). The results showed that freeze-dried FBF could significantly (P < 0.05) inhibit aerobic bacteria, coliforms, Pseudomonas spp., and lactic acid bacteria, with the lowest microbial counts observed in L.3. The addition of freeze-dried FBF resulted in concentration-dependent decreases in total volatile basic nitrogen values and pH values but increases in lipid oxidation and color instability. Based on the criteria regarding microbiological and physicochemical parameters, the shelf life was 9 to 12 days for L.1, 12 to 15 days for L.2, and over 15 days for L.3, while the shelf-lives of the control and nisin treatments were 3 to 6 days, indicating that freeze-dried FBF could extend the shelf life by more than 3 days. Although the shelf life of L.1 was shorter than those of L.2 and L.3, the appearance of L.1 was much better than those of L.2 and L.3. Overall, treatment with 4 or 8% freeze-dried FBF could be improved if color and lipid oxidation could be improved by appropriate stabilizers, and a lower concentration (2%) of freeze-dried FBF has great potential as a natural and safe preservative in chilled pork patties.
TI  - Variable efficacy of a vaccine and direct-fed microbial for controlling Escherichia coli O157:H7 in feces and on hides of feedlot cattle.
AB  - To evaluate the efficacy of a type-III secreted proteins vaccine and a Lactobacillus-acidophilus-based direct-fed microbial (DFM) for controlling Escherichia coli O157:H7, cattle (n=864) were allocated to the following groups: DFM, finishing diets containing 10(9) colony-forming units (CFU)/animal/day L. acidophilus and Propionibacterium freudenreichii; VAC, finishing diets and 2 mL intramuscular injection of vaccine at allocation and 28 days later; or CON, finishing diets only. Cattle within replicates were stratified by initial levels of E. coli O157:H7 and randomized to experimental groups, with 30 pens allocated on June 15, 2011 (AS1), 18 pens allocated on June 28, 2011 (AS2), and 18 cattle per pen. Rectal fecal samples and perineal swabs were collected at 28-day intervals until shipment to slaughter (103-145 days on trial). Numbers of cattle with enumerable E. coli O157:H7 (>/=1.6 CFU/g feces) were reduced in AS1 and AS2 by VAC (p=0.008), although interventions had no impact on numbers of E. coli O157:H7 shed. For AS1, VAC reduced prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 in feces (p=0.03) and perineal swabs (p=0.04) in the feeding period but not at shipment to slaughter. For AS2, prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 was not reduced in either feces or perineal swabs by VAC at any time. For AS1, DFM reduced prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 in perineal swabs (p=0.01) during the feeding period. For AS2, DFM increased E. coli O157:H7 detection in feces (p=0.03) and perineal swabs (p=0.01) at shipment to slaughter. Seventy-five percent of AS1 E. coli O157:H7 isolates had only stx1, while 87% of AS2 isolates had stx1 and stx2 genes. Of the two interventions, VAC shows the most potential for pre-harvest control of E. coli O157:H7, but due to variable efficacy of both DFM and VAC, additional product development is necessary to ensure more consistent pre-harvest control of E. coli O157:H7.
TI  - Graphene oxide as an anaerobic membrane scaffold for the enhancement of B. adolescentis proliferation and antagonistic effects against pathogens E. coli and S. aureus.
AB  - The impact of the gut microbiota on human health is widely perceived as the most  exciting advancement in biomedicine. The gut microbiota has been known to play a crucial role in defining states of human health and diseases, and thus becomes a potential new territory for drug targeting. Herein, graphene oxide (GO) interaction with five common human gut bacteria, B. adolescentis, L. acidophilus, E. coli, E. faecalis, and S. aureus, was studied. It was shown that, in bacterial media, GO sheets were able to form effective, anaerobic membrane scaffolds that enhanced the antagonistic activity of B. adolescentis against the pathogens E. coli andS. aureus. Data obtained using bacterial growth measurements, colony counting and 16S rRNA gene sequencing consistently indicated that GO sheets promoted proliferation of gut bacteria, particularly for B. adolescentis. Scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy images, and membrane potential measurements showed that cell membranes maintained their integrity and that no observable variations in cell morphology were induced after interaction with GO sheets, indicating good biocompatibility of GO. These results suggest the possibility of using GO sheets as efficient drug carriers in therapeutic applications to treat diseases related to the gut microbiota.
TI  - Characterization of pMC11, a plasmid with dual origins of replication isolated from Lactobacillus casei MCJ and construction of shuttle vectors with each replicon.
AB  - Many lactic acid bacteria carry different plasmids, particularly those that replicate via a theta mechanism. Here we describe Lactobacillus casei MCJ(CCTCC AB20130356), a new isolate that contains pMC11, carrying two distinct theta-type replicons. Each replicon contained an iteron in the origin of replication (oriV1 or oriV2) and a gene coding for the replicase (RepA_1 or RepB_1), both of which are essential for plasmid replication. Escherichia coli/Lactobacillus shuttle vectors were constructed with each replicon, yielding pEL5.7 and pEL5.6 that are based on oriV2 and oriV1 replicons, respectively. These plasmids showed distinct properties: pEL5.7 was capable of replicating in L. casei MCJDelta1 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactic LBCH-1 but failed to do so in two other tested lactobacilli strains whereas pEL5.6 replicated in three different strains, including L. casei MCJDelta1, L. casei NJ, Lactobacillus paracasei LPC-37 and L. delbrueckii subsp. lactic LBCH-1. Plasmid stability was studied: pEL5.6 and pEL5.7 were very stably maintained in L. casei, as the loss rate was lower than 1 % per generation. pEL5.7 was also stable in L. delbrueckii subsp. lactic LBCH-1 with the loss rate estimated to be 3 %. These vectors were employed to express a green fluorescent protein (GFP) using the promoter of S-layer protein SlpA from Lactobacillus acidophilus. And a growth-phase regulated expression of GFP was observed in different strains. In conclusion, these shuttle vectors provide efficient genetic tools for DNA cloning and heterologous gene expression in lactobacilli.
TI  - Fe2+ and Cu2+ increase the production of hyaluronic acid by lactobacilli via affecting different stages of the pentose phosphate pathway.
AB  - This study aimed at optimizing the production of hyaluronic acid by Lactobacillus acidophilus FTDC 1231 using response surface methodology and evaluating the effects of divalent metal ions along the production pathway using molecular docking. Among different divalent metal ions that were screened, only iron (II) sulphate and copper (II) sulphate significantly (P < 0.05) affected the production of hyaluronic acid. Subsequent optimization yielded hyaluronic acid at concentration of 0.6152 mg/mL in the presence of 1.24 mol L(-1) iron (II) sulphate and 0.16 mol L(-1) of copper (II) sulphate (103 % increase compared to absence of divalent metal ions). Data from molecular docking showed Fe(2+) improved the binding affinity of UDP-pyrophophorylase towards glucose-1-phosphate, while Cu(2+) contributed towards the interaction between UDP-glucose dehydrogenase and UDP-glucose. We have demonstrated that lactobacilli could produce hyaluronic acid at increased concentration upon facilitation by specific divalent metal ions, via specific targets of enzymes and substrates along pentose phosphate pathway.
TI  - Plasmin digest of kappa-casein as a source of antibacterial peptides.
AB  - This study investigated the antibacterial properties of plasmin, the plasmin hydrolysis of bovine kappa-casein and the fractions (named kappaC1, kappaC2, kappaC3, kappaC4, and kappaC5) liberated from it using RP-HPLC. The target bacteria were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus (pathogenic), Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus (probiotic). Three peptides (kC1, kC3, and kC4) were found to have antibacterial activity, with kappaC3 peptide being the most active. The plasmin digest of bovine kappa-casein proved to be stronger than any of its fractions in terms of antibacterial potential. Measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) showed that Gram-positive bacteria are generally more sensitive to antibacterial activity than Gram-negative bacteria. The MIC of nisin, as a bacteriocin peptide, was also measured. The three antibacterial peptides were identified using LC-Mass. The molecular mass of kC1, kC3, and kC4 corresponded to the f(17-21), f(22-24), and f(1-3) of bovine kappa-casein, respectively. It was also found that the positive charge and hydrophobicity of a peptide are not key factors in antibacterial activity. On the whole, the present study demonstrated that the plasmin digest of kappa-casein has a high antibacterial potential and can be considered as a natural antibacterial agent in the food chain.
TI  - In vivo gut transcriptome responses to Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactobacillus acidophilus in neonatal gnotobiotic piglets.
AB  - Probiotics facilitate mucosal repair and maintain gut homeostasis. They are often used in adjunct with rehydration or antibiotic therapy in enteric infections. Lactobacillus spp have been tested in infants for the prevention or treatment of various enteric conditions. However, to aid in rational strain selection for specific treatments, comprehensive studies are required to delineate and compare the specific molecules and pathways involved in a less complex but biologically relevant model (gnotobiotic pigs). Here we elucidated Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LGG) and L. acidophilus (LA) specific effects on gut transcriptome responses in a neonatal gnotobiotic (Gn) pig model to simulate responses in newly colonized infants. Whole genome microarray, followed by biological pathway reconstruction, was used to investigate the host-microbe interactions in duodenum and ileum at early (day 1) and later stages (day 7) of colonization. Both LA and LGG modulated common responses related to host metabolism, gut integrity, and immunity, as well as responses unique to each strain in Gn pigs. Our data indicated that probiotic establishment and beneficial effects in the host are guided by: (1) down-regulation or upregulation of immune function-related genes in the early and later stages of colonization, respectively, and (2) alternations in metabolism of small molecules (vitamins and/or minerals) and macromolecules (carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids). Pathways related to immune modulation and carbohydrate metabolism were more affected by LGG, whereas energy and lipid metabolism-related transcriptome responses were prominently modulated by LA. These findings imply that identification of probiotic strain-specific gut responses could facilitate the rational design of probiotic-based interventions to moderate specific enteric conditions.
TI  - Cytotoxicity of lapachol metabolites produced by probiotics.
AB  - Probiotics are currently added to a variety of functional foods to provide health benefits to the host and are commonly used by patients with gastrointestinal complaints or diseases. The therapeutic effects of lapachol continue to inspire studies to obtain derivatives with improved bioactivity and lower unwanted effects. Therefore, the general goal of this study was to show that probiotics are able to convert lapachol and are important to assess the effects of bacterial metabolism on drug performance and toxicity. The microbial transformations of lapachol were carried out by Bifidobacterium sp. and Lactobacillus acidophilus and different metabolites were produced in mixed and isolated cultures. The cytotoxic activities against breast cancer and normal fibroblast cell lines of the isolated metabolites (4alpha-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-5-oxo-2,3,4,4alpha,5,9beta-hexahydroindeno[1,2-beta] pyran-9beta-carboxilic acid, a new metabolite produced by mixed culture and dehydro-alpha-lapachone produced by isolated cultures) were assessed and compared with those of lapachol. The new metabolite displayed a lower activity against a breast cancer cell line (IC50 = 532.7 mumol l(-1) ) than lapachol (IC50 = 72.3 mumol l(-1) ), while dehydro-alpha-lapachone (IC50 = 10.4 mumol l(-1) ) displayed a higher activity than lapachol. The present study is the first to demonstrate that probiotics are capable of converting lapachol into the most effective cytotoxic compound against a breast cancer cell line. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Probiotics have been used in dairy products to promote human health and have the ability to metabolize drugs and other xenobiotics. Naphthoquinones, such as lapachol, are considered privileged scaffolds due to their high propensity to interact with biological targets. The present study is the first to demonstrate that probiotics are capable of converting lapachol into the most effective cytotoxic compound against a breast cancer cell line. The developed approach highlights the importance of probiotics to assess the effects of bacterial metabolism on drug performance and toxicity.
TI  - Effect of porous starch concentrations on the microbiological characteristics of  microencapsulated Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of different porous starch concentrations on the microbiological characteristics of microencapsulated Lactobacillus acidophilus. Results showed that the encapsulation efficiency of L. acidophilus with porous starch at a concentration of 10% is the highest (61.2%) compared with other concentrations. The morphology of microencapsulation was observed by scanning electron microscope. Moreover, survival assays at pH 1.5 indicated that, at the end of 3 h, the cell numbers for microencapsulation with 10% porous starch and free cells showed 2.63 and 4.01 logarithmic cycle reductions, respectively. However, no significant reduction in viable count was observed in microcapsules as well as for free cells at pH 6.5 for 3 h. The improving survival rate under high temperatures was observed with increasing concentration of porous starch from 6 to 10% and decreasing temperature. The released counts were increased with prolonged incubation time and were between 6.34 and 6.46 log CFU g(-1) at the end of storage exposure for 2.5 h to simulated colonic pH solution. These results indicated that porous starch with the optimum concentration as a carrier can be considered as an innovative technology to improve the stability of L. acidophilus.
TI  - Effect of probiotics on antioxidant and antimutagenic activities of crude peptide extract from yogurt.
AB  - Search for bioactive peptides is intensifying because of the risks associated with the use of synthetic therapeutics, thus peptide liberation by lactic acid bacteria and probiotics has received a great focus. However, proteolytic capacity of these bacteria is strain specific. The study was conducted to establish proteolytic activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus (ATCC(R) 4356), Lactobacillus casei (ATCC(R) 393) and Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (ATCC(R) BAA52) in yogurt. Crude peptides were separated by high-speed centrifugation and tested for antioxidant and antimutagenic activities. The degree of proteolysis highly correlated with these bioactivities, and its value (11.91%) for samples containing all the cultures was double that of the control. Liberated peptides showed high radical scavenging activities with 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid), IC50 1.51 and 1.63mg/ml, respectively and strong antimutagenicity (26.35%). These probiotics enhanced the generation of bioactive peptides and could possibly be commercially applied in new products, or production of novel anticancer peptides.
TI  - Saccharomyces boulardii expresses neuraminidase activity selective for alpha2,3-linked sialic acid that decreases Helicobacter pylori adhesion to host cells.
AB  - Helicobacter pylori is a major causative agent of gastritis and peptic ulcer disease and is an established risk factor for gastric malignancy. Antibiotic combination therapy can eradicate H. pylori. As these same regimens can evoke adverse effects and resistance, new alternative therapies or adjunctive treatments are needed. A probiotic approach may provide a novel strategy for H. pylori treatment. In the current study, two probiotic bacteria, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus reuteri, and a probiotic yeast, Saccharomyces boulardii, were evaluated for their ability to influence H. pylori viability, adherence to gastric and duodenal cells, as well as the effect of S. boulardii on cell surface expression of sialic acid. Our results indicate that S. boulardii contains neuraminidase activity selective for alpha(2-3)-linked sialic acid. This neuraminidase activity removes surface alpha(2-3)-linked sialic acid, the ligand for the sialic acid-binding H. pylori adhesin, which in turn, inhibits H. pylori adherence to duodenal epithelial cells.
TI  - Intensity and duration of in-vitro antibacterial activity of different adhesives  used in orthodontics.
AB  - This work investigated the antibacterial activity of 14 bonding agents to predict their ability to inhibit white-spot development during orthodontic treatment. Standardized, sterilized disks of each material were continuously rinsed (for up to 180 d) in a flow of sterile saline. At predetermined time points, the residual ability of each material to inhibit bacterial growth (determined by measuring the size of inhibition halos around disks placed onto appropriate culture media seeded with Streptococcus gordonii DSM6777, Streptococcus sanguinis DSM20567, Streptococcus mutans DSM20523, or Lactobacillus acidophilus DSM20079) and biofilm formation (determined by measuring the numbers of bacteria adherent to disks following incubation in appropriate broths) was tested in triplicate and compared with the baseline activities of freshly prepared materials. Overall antibacterial and anti-biofilm activities, adjusted for exposure time and strain of bacteria, were assessed. The decrease of antibacterial activity was faster (30-60 d) and complete for fluoride-enriched materials, but slower (90 d) and partial for antimicrobial-containing materials (benzalkonium chloride, zinc oxide, chlorexidine, or MDPB). Materials enriched with benzalkonium chloride, chlorexidine, or MDPB showed the highest antibacterial activities. Anti-biofilm assays yielded similar results. These data could be helpful for clinicians in the choice of the best performing bonding agent also in light of duration of the clinical application.
TI  - Use of probiotics for management of acute gastroenteritis: a position paper by the ESPGHAN Working Group for Probiotics and Prebiotics.
AB  - The use of probiotics has been suggested in the treatment of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in addition to early rehydration and avoidance of dietary restrictions. This document provides recommendations for the use of probiotics for the treatment of AGE in previously healthy infants and children based on a systematic review of previously completed systematic reviews and of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published subsequently to these reviews. The recommendations were formulated only if at least 2 RCTs that used a given probiotic (with strain specification) were available. The GRADE system developed by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations Working Group, was used to grade the strength of evidence and grades of recommendations used in these guidelines. It offers 4 categories of the quality of the evidence (high, moderate, low, and very low) and 2 categories of the strength of recommendation (strong or weak). The use of the following probiotics (in alphabetical order) may be considered in the management of children with AGE in addition to rehydration therapy: Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (low quality of evidence, strong recommendation) and Saccharomyces boulardii (low quality of evidence, strong recommendation). Less compelling evidence is available for Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 (very low quality of evidence, weak recommendation) and heat-inactivated Lactobacillus acidophilus LB (very low quality of evidence, weak recommendation). The latter, although traditionally discussed with other probiotics, does not fit with the definition of probiotics. Other strains or combinations of strains have been tested, but evidence of their efficacy is weak or preliminary.
TI  - Maternal and postnatal dietary probiotic supplementation enhances splenic regulatory T helper cell population and reduces ovalbumin allergen-induced hypersensitivity responses in mice.
AB  - Neonatal to early childhood is the critical period for establishing a balance of  T helper 1 (Th1) versus T helper 2 (Th2) cellular immunity within the gut, which is strongly influenced by the source and establishment of gut microflora. Probiotic administration has been shown to attenuate Th2-biased cellular immunity and predisposition to food allergies. To test this hypothesis we provided ad libitum a probiotic-supplemented (Primalac 454 Feed Grade Microbials) or control diet to lactating dams with suckling pups and weaned pups until 10 weeks of age. Weaned mice were sensitized/challenged with egg allergen ovalbumin, saline or adjuvant at 6, 8 and 10 weeks of age. At 3, 6, 8 and 10 weeks, fecal samples were collected for microbial analysis, while blood samples were analyzed for ovalbumin-IgE and total plasma IgE levels. At termination, splenic T helper cell lymphocyte population subtypes were determined using FACS analysis and Th1/Th2/Th17 gene expression by PCR array. At 21 days of age, pups suckled by lactating dams fed the probiotic supplemented diet had significantly enhanced Lactobacillus acidophilus fecal counts compared to controls. Moreover, mice fed the probiotic supplemented diet had enhanced splenic naturally occurring and induced regulatory T cell populations, enhanced TGFbeta gene expression and reduced expression of allergic mediator IL13 compared to controls. These results provide evidence that early probiotic supplementation may provide host protection from hypersensitivity reactions to food allergens by attenuating food allergen inflammatory responses.
TI  - [Application of multiplex PCR for analysis of polycomponent probiotic preparations].
AB  - AIM: Development of multiplex PCR for indication and differential analysis of CFU in a probiotic preparation containing 3 various species ofbifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium bifidum, B. longum, B. adolescentis) and 2 species of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. plantarum). MATERIALS AND METHODS; Multiplex PCR with primers to 16S RNA genes of 5 species of bacteria was applied. Samples of bacterial colonies were removed from solid nutrient medium and transferred into test-tube for multiplex PCR execution. Bacterial lysates were used as target-matrix for amplification and determination of presence of the required amplicons. RESULTS: Multiplex PCR for detection of CFU of each of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli strains in samples of 5-component probiotic with accuracy up to species was developed. A reagent kit was fine-tuned and high reproducibility and specificity of the multiplex PCR method with the accuracy of 90 - 95% of cases was shown. CONCLUSION: The multiplex PCR method developed is recommended to be applied for CFU control of each bacterial component in a complex probiotic preparation.
TI  - Systematic screening of plant extracts from the Brazilian Pantanal with antimicrobial activity against bacteria with cariogenic relevance.
AB  - This study proposes a bioprospection methodology regarding the antimicrobial potential of plant extracts against bacteria with cariogenic relevance. Sixty extracts were obtained from ten plants--(1) Jatropha weddelliana, (2) Attalea phalerata, (3) Buchenavia tomentosa, (4) Croton doctoris, (5) Mouriri elliptica, (6) Mascagnia benthamiana, (7) Senna aculeata, (8) Unonopsis guatterioides, (9) Allagoptera leucocalyx and (10) Bactris glaucescens--using different extraction methods - (A) 70 degrees ethanol 72 h/25 degrees C, (B) water 5 min/100 degrees C, (C) water 1 h/55 degrees C, (D) water 72 h/25 degrees C, (E) hexane 72 h/25 degrees C and (F) 90 degrees ethanol 72 h/25 degrees C. The plants were screened for antibacterial activity at 50 mg/ml using the agar well diffusion test against Actinomyces naeslundii ATCC 19039, Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356, Streptococcus gordonii ATCC 10558, Streptococcus mutans ATCC 35688, Streptococcus sanguinis ATCC 10556, Streptococcus sobrinus ATCC 33478 and Streptococcus mitis ATCC 9811. The active extracts were tested to determine their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), cytotoxicity and chemical characterization. Forty-seven extracts (78%) were active against at least one microorganism. Extract 4A demonstrated the lowest MIC and MBC for all microorganisms except S. gordonii and the extract at MIC concentration was non-cytotoxic. The concentrated extracts were slightly cytotoxic. Electrospray ionization with tandem mass spectrometry analyses demonstrated that the extract constituents coincided with the mass of the terpenoids and phenolics. Overall, the best results were obtained for extraction methods A, B and C. The present work proved the antimicrobial activity of several plants. Particularly, extracts from C. doctoris were the most active against bacteria involved in dental caries disease.
TI  - Construction of a food-grade cell surface display system for Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - In this study, a food-grade cell surface display host/vector system for Lactobacillus casei was constructed. The food-grade host L. casei Q-5 was a lactose-deficient derivative of L. casei ATCC 334 obtained by plasmid elimination. The food-grade cell surface display vector was constructed based on safe DNA elements from lactic acid bacteria containing the following: pSH71 replicon from Lactococcus lactis, lactose metabolism genes from L. casei ATCC 334 as complementation markers, and surface layer protein gene from Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 for cell surface display. The feasibility of the new host/vector system was verified by the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) on L. casei. Laser scanning confocal microscopy and immunofluorescence analysis using anti-GFP antibody confirmed that GFP was anchored on the surface of the recombinant cells. The stability of recombinant L. casei cells in artificial gastrointestinal conditions was verified, which is beneficial for oral vaccination applications. These results indicate that the food-grade host/vector system can be an excellent antigen delivery vehicle in oral vaccine construction.
TI  - Isolation and identification of quercetin degrading bacteria from human fecal microbes.
AB  - Quercetin has a wide range of biological properties. The gut microflora can often modulate its biological activity and their potential health effects. There still is a lack of information about gut bacteria involving in this process. The strains of gut microbes from human feces that can transform quercetin were isolated and identified by in vitro fermentation. The results showed that Escherichia coli, Stretococcus lutetiensis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Weissella confusa, Enterococcus gilvus, Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis have the various ability of degrading quercetin. Among them, C. perfringens and B. fragilis were discovered to have the strongest ability of degrading quercetin. Additionally, quercetin can't inhibit the growth of C. perfringens. In conclusion, many species of gut microbiota can degrade quercetin, but their ability are different.
TI  - Effects of carbonation on probiotic survivability, physicochemical, and sensory properties of milk-based symbiotic beverages.
AB  - Drinkable yogurt is a popular beverage in the United States and there may be a niche for carbonated drinkable yogurt in the functional foods market. Pomegranate (P) and vanilla (V) yogurt beverages were formulated, containing inulin as a prebiotic, along with probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium, to produce symbiotic products. These beverages were stabilized with high-methoxyl pectin and whey protein concentrate and compared to samples with approximately 2 volumes of added carbon dioxide (CO2 ). Samples were stored in sealed glass bottles at 4 degrees C for 9 wk for evaluation of physicochemical and functional properties. Trials were carried out in triplicate and 3 replicates from each trial were analyzed. Physicochemical attributes were analyzed using standard AOAC methods. Survivability of the probiotics and changes in pH and viscosity were measured weekly. Chemical composition of the carbonated beverages was: protein: 1.58 +/- 0.05%, 1.59 +/- 0.06%, fat: 1.24 +/- 0.2%, 1.18 +/- 0.11%, total solids: 14.78 +/- 0.11%, 14.93 +/- 0.05%, ash: 0.49 +/- 0.02%, 0.46 +/- 0.03%, and carbohydrate (by difference): 11.47 +/- 0.12%, 11.69 +/- 0.14% for P and V, respectively. Both L. acidophilus and Bifidobacterium were stable and remained above 10(6) CFU/g for both flavors of beverage both with and without carbonation. The new manufacturing technology for these prototypes may have potential for commercialization of carbonated symbiotic milk-based beverages.
TI  - Changes on expected taste perception of probiotic and conventional yogurts made from goat milk after rapidly repeated exposure.
AB  - Goat milk yogurt is an excellent source of fatty acids, protein, and minerals; however, it is not well accepted by many consumers, due to its typical flavor derived from caprylic, capric, and caproic acids present in this milk and dairy products. Recently, the repeated-exposure test has been used to increase the consumption of particular foods. This methodology has been used to increase children's willingness to eat food in some settings and has also been used to reduce sodium in soup. Based on these considerations, the aim of this study was to investigate whether repeated exposures may increase acceptance of both goat milk yogurt and probiotic goat milk yogurt. In a pre-exposure session, a total of 45 panelists (28 females and 17 males) from southeastern Brazil, who were not used to consuming dairy goat milk, evaluated the expected taste perception and the perceived liking after tasting 3 yogurt preparations. Then, consumers were randomly divided into 3 groups and participated in rapidly repeated exposure sessions performed within 6 d. Each panelist consumed only the yogurt that he or she would be exposed to. The day after the exposure sessions, all panelists returned to participate in the postexposure session and were asked to evaluate acceptance, familiarity, and the "goaty taste" characteristic of each yogurt. Regarding the expected liking before tasting, results showed higher expectations for cow milk yogurt compared with goat milk yogurt, which proved that consumers were not familiar with the goat milk yogurt. Likewise, only cow milk yogurt presented high acceptance and familiarity rates, confirming that these panelists were used to consuming cow milk products. With respect to the rapidly repeated exposure, 6 d were enough to significantly increase the consumers' familiarity with goat milk yogurt and probiotic goat milk yogurt. However, this method was not suitable to significantly increase the acceptance of such products. Nonetheless, a correlation existed between the exposure sessions and the increase in acceptance of the exposure groups. Thus, hypothetically, the increasing of exposure sessions could be a strategy to increase goat milk product acceptance.
TI  - Long-term use of probiotics Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium has a prophylactic  effect on the occurrence and severity of pouchitis: a randomized prospective study.
AB  - AIM: The aim of the study was to assess the impact of the long-term use of the composite probiotics in patients after restorative proctocolectomy. METHOD: Forty-three patients (20 females and 23 males, aged 21 to 68 years) after restorative proctocolectomy were included in the study. After randomization patients were divided into placebo group and treatment group with oral intake of probiotic containing Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Bifidobacterium bifidus. Patients were investigated during initial visit and during final visit after 9 months. All patients were subjected to standard clinical and endoscopic examination with microscopic study of the specimens. Concentrations of calprotectin and pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2-PK were determined in all cases. RESULTS: The average severity of pouchitis and the number of patients with pouchitis significantly decrease after 9 months of the probiotic taking. The concentrations of calprotectin and pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2-PK significantly decreased after the therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Nine months of the probiotic treatment (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Bifidobacterium bifidus) reduced the number of patients with pouchitis, decreased the PDAI score, and also decreased the fecal pyruvate kinase and calprotectin. The long-term probiotics use is safe and well accepted and can be an effective method of the pouchitis prevention.
TI  - Yerba mate enhances probiotic bacteria growth in vitro but as a feed additive does not reduce Salmonella Enteritidis colonization in vivo.
AB  - Yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis) is a tea known to have beneficial effects on human health and antimicrobial activity against some foodborne pathogens. Thus, the application of yerba mate as a feed additive for broiler chickens to reduce Salmonella colonization was evaluated. The first in vitro evaluation was conducted by suspending Salmonella Enteritidis and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in yerba mate extract. The in vivo evaluations were conducted using preventative and horizontal transmission experiments. In all experiments, day-of-hatch chicks were treated with one of the following 1) no treatment (control); 2) ground yerba mate in feed; 3) probiotic treatment (Lactobacillus acidophilus and Pediococcus; 9:1 administered once on day of hatch by gavage); or 4) both yerba mate and probiotic treatments. At d 3, all chicks were challenged with Salmonella Enteritidis (preventative experiment) or 5 of 20 chicks (horizontal transmission experiment). At d 10, all birds were euthanized, weighed, and cecal contents enumerated for Salmonella. For the in vitro evaluation, antimicrobial activity was observed against Salmonella and the same treatment enhanced growth of LAB. For in vivo evaluations, none of the yerba mate treatments significantly reduced Salmonella Enteritidis colonization, whereas the probiotic treatment significantly reduced Salmonella colonization in the horizontal transmission experiment. Yerba mate decreased chicken BW and decreased the performance of the probiotic treatment when used in combination. In conclusion, yerba mate had antimicrobial activity against foodborne pathogens and enhanced the growth of LAB in vitro, but in vivo yerba mate did not decrease Salmonella Enteritidis colonization.
TI  - Effects of multistrain probiotics on growth performance, apparent ileal nutrient  digestibility, blood characteristics, cecal microbial shedding, and excreta odor contents in broilers.
AB  - This experiment was conducted to investigate the efficacy of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bacillus subtilis, and Clostridium butyricum supplementation in broilers. A total of 400 one-day-old mixed sex Ross 308 broilers with an initial average BW of 46 +/- 0.5 g were randomly allotted into 4 treatments with 5 replicate pens per treatment and 20 broilers in each pen for 35 d. Dietary treatments were (1) an antibiotic-free diet (CON), (2) CON + 5 mg/kg of avilamycin, (3) CON + 1 x 10(5) cfu of multistrain probiotics/kg of diet (P1), and (4) CON + 2 x 10(5) cfu of multistrain probiotics/kg of diet (P2). Broilers fed the P1 and P2 diets had greater BW gain than broilers fed the CON diet during d 22 to 35 (P = 0.01) and overall (P = 0.02). Feed conversion ratios in P1 and P2 were decreased (P = 0.03) compared with that in CON from d 22 to 35. Ileal digestibility of most essential amino acids, with the exception of His and Phe, were increased (P < 0.05) in P1 and P2 compared with CON. Serum IgA and IgM concentrations in P2 were higher (P < 0.05) than those in CON. The cecal Lactobacillus numbers were increased (P = 0.02), and the counts of Escherichia coli were decreased (P = 0.03) in P1 and P2 compared with CON. Dietary supplementation with multistrain probiotics decreased (P < 0.05) the excreta NH3 content compared with the CON. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with multistrain probiotics improved broiler growth performance, ileal amino acids digestibility, and humoral immunity. Furthermore, the probiotics decreased the cecal numbers of E. coli and decreased the NH3 content of excreta.
TI  - The effects of probiotic bacteria on glycaemic control in overweight men and women: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Evidence from animal and in vitro models suggest a role of probiotic bacteria in improving glycaemic control and delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes. However, the evidence from controlled trials in humans is limited. The objective was to determine if the probiotic bacteria L. acidophilus La5 and B. animalis subsp lactis Bb12, supplemented in a whole food (yoghurt) or isolated (capsules) form, can improve biomarkers of glycaemic control. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Following a 3-week washout period, 156 overweight men and women over 55 years (mean age: 67 +/- 8 years; mean body mass index (31 +/- 4 kg/m(2)) were randomized to a 6-week double-blinded parallel study. The four intervention groups were: (A) probiotic yoghurt plus probiotic capsules; (B) probiotic yoghurt plus placebo capsules; (C) control milk plus probiotic capsules; and (D) control milk plus placebo capsules. Outcome measurements, including fasting glucose, insulin, glycated haemoglobin and Homoeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), were performed at baseline and week 6. RESULTS: Relative to the milk-control group, probiotic yoghurt resulted in a significantly higher HOMA-IR (0.32 +/- 0.15, P=0.038), but did not have a significant effect on the other three measures of glycaemic control (P>0.05). Relative to placebo capsules, probiotic capsules resulted in a significantly higher fasting glucose (0.15 +/- 0.07 mmol/l, P=0.037), with no significant effect on the other three measures of glycaemic control (P>0.05). Further analyses did not identify other variables as contributing to these adverse findings. CONCLUSIONS: Data from this study does not support the hypothesis that L. acidophilus La5 and B. animalis subsp lactis Bb12, either in isolated form or as part of a whole food, benefit short-term glycaemic control. Indeed, there is weak data for an adverse effect of these strains on glucose homoeostasis.
TI  - Polyethylene glycol-based hydrogels for controlled release of the antimicrobial subtilosin for prophylaxis of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Current treatment options for bacterial vaginosis (BV) have been shown to be inadequate at preventing recurrence and do not provide protection against associated infections, such as that with HIV. This study examines the feasibility of incorporating the antimicrobial peptide subtilosin within covalently cross-linked polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based hydrogels for vaginal administration. The PEG-based hydrogels (4% and 6% [wt/vol]) provided a two-phase release of subtilosin, with an initial rapid release rate of 4.0 mug/h (0 to 12 h) followed by a slow, sustained release rate of 0.26 mug/h (12 to 120 h). The subtilosin-containing hydrogels inhibited the growth of the major BV-associated pathogen Gardnerella vaginalis with a reduction of 8 log10 CFU/ml with hydrogels containing >/=15 mug entrapped subtilosin. In addition, the growth of four common species of vaginal lactobacilli was not significantly inhibited in the presence of the subtilosin-containing hydrogels. The above findings demonstrate the potential application of vaginal subtilosin-containing hydrogels for prophylaxis of BV.
TI  - Quantitative profiling of bacteriocins present in dairy-free probiotic preparations of Lactobacillus acidophilus by nanoliquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
AB  - Bacteriocins are a heterogeneous group of ribosomally synthesized peptides or proteins with antimicrobial activity, produced predominantly by lactic acid bacteria, with potential applications as biopreservatives and probiotics. We describe here a novel strategy based on a bottom-up, shotgun proteomic approach using nanoliquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) with multiple fragmentation techniques for the quantitative profiling of bacteriocins present in the probiotic preparations of Lactobacillus acidophilus. A direct LC-MS/MS analysis with alternate collision-induced dissociation, high-energy collision dissociation, and electron-transfer dissociation fragmentation following a filter-assisted size-exclusion sample prefractionation has resulted in the identification of peptides belonging to 37 bacteriocins or related proteins. Peptides from lactacin F, helveticin J, lysin, avicin A, acidocin M, curvaticin FS47, and carocin D were predominant. The process of freeze drying under vacuum was observed to affect both the diversity and abundance of bacteriocins. Data acquisition using alternating complementary peptide fragmentation modes, especially electron-transfer dissociation, has significantly enhanced the peptide sequence coverage and number of bacteriocin peptides identified. Multi-enzyme proteolytic digestion was observed to increase the sample complexity and dynamic range, lowering the chances of detection of low-abundant bacteriocin peptides by LC-MS/MS. An analytical platform integrating size exclusion prefractionation, nanoLC-MS/MS analysis with multiple fragmentation techniques, and data-dependent decision tree-driven bioinformatic data analysis is novel in bacteriocin research and suitable for the comprehensive bioanalysis of diverse, low-abundant bacteriocins in complex samples.
TI  - Probiotic Dahi containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum modulates the formation of aberrant crypt foci, mucin-depleted foci, and cell proliferation on 1,2-dimethylhydrazine-induced colorectal carcinogenesis in Wistar rats.
AB  - Aberrant crypt foci (ACF) and mucin-depleted foci (MDF) are pre-neoplastic lesions identified in the colon of carcinogen-treated rodents and in humans at high risk for colon cancer. The present study was carried out to divulge the protective potential of the probiotic Dahi containing Lactobacillus acidophilus LaVK2 and Bifidobacterium bifidum BbVK3 alone or in combination with piroxicam (PXC) on the development of early biomarkers of colorectal carcinogenesis in male Wistar rats administered 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH). DMH was injected subcutaneously at the rate of 40 mg/kg body weight per animal twice a week for 2 weeks. A total of 120 male Wistar rats were randomly allocated to five groups, each group having 24 animals. The rats were fed with buffalo milk or probiotic supplement (20 grams) alone or as an adjunct with PXC in addition to a basal diet ad libitum for 32 weeks. Group I was offered buffalo milk (BM) and served as the control group. Group II was administered DMH along with BM and served as the DMH-control group; group III was administered BM-DMH-PXC, in which besides administering BM-DMH, PXC was also offered. Group IV was offered probiotic LaBb Dahi and DMH, and group V was offered both probiotic LaBb Dahi and PXC along with DMH. The rats were euthanized at the 8(th), 16(th), and 32(nd) week of the experiment and examined for development of ACF, aberrant crypts per ACF (AC/ACF), mucin-depleted foci (MDF), large MDF, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) labeling index. Administration of DMH in rats induced pre-neoplastic lesions (ACF and MDF) and increased the PCNA index in colorectal tissue. A significant (p<0.05) reduction in the number of ACF, AC/ACF, MDF, large MDF, and PCNA labeling index were observed in the probiotic LaBb Dahi group compared with the DMH control group. Feeding rats with LaBb Dahi or treatment with PXC diminished the initiation and progression of DMH-induced pre-neoplastic lesions and the PCNA index, and treatment with LaBb Dahi and PXC combined was significantly more effective. The dietary intervention of probiotics and PXC significantly protects against the development of CRC in the rat-DMH model. These observations suggest that probiotic LaBb Dahi alone or as an adjunct with PXC may have anti-neoplastic and anti-proliferative activities. Moreover, probiotic LaBb Dahi possesses the medicinal properties to prevent colorectal carcinogenesis.
TI  - The impact of inoculation rate and order on physicochemical, microstructural and  sensory attributes of probiotic doogh.
AB  - Effects of inoculation level (4 or 8-fold compared to standard inoculation) and order (standard inoculation before fermentation and 3-fold inoculation at the end of fermentation = 1+3, Two-fold inoculation before fermentation and the same at the end of fermentation = 2+2, 2+6, 4-fold before fermentation = 4, 4+4, and 8) of culture inoculums containing probiotics on viscosity, phase separation, particle size analysis, microstructure and sensory attributes of probiotic Doogh were studied. The probiotic microorganisms were Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 and Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12. Treatments with 2- and 4-fold inoculation before fermentation had the highest instrumental viscosity and surface tension at the end of fermentation. The size diameter of particles in the structure of treatment 8I was significantly (p < 0.05) smaller than I after stirring with a Lab stirrer (1500 rpm), and even after homogenization with a homogenizer (150 bar). 8I was an un-uniform, disintegrated and clumped structure with limited junctions in its network that resulted in a weak structure with bigger particles after agitation and smaller particles after stirring and homogenization compared to other treatments. This treatment also had the lowest record in ranking sensory test among treatments with a mixed culture-like and vinegary-like taint. Overall, treatments with 2- and 4-fold inoculation were realized as the best from the sum of physiochemical and sensory properties point of view.
TI  - Effect of denak (Oliveria decumbens Vent) on growth and survival of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum for production of probiotic herbal milk and yoghurt.
AB  - This study was undertaken to determine the suitability of different doses (0, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5%) of Denak powder (Oliveria decumbens Vent) on viability of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum in milk and yoghurt during 21 day refrigerated storage for production of probiotic herbal milk and yoghurt. In order to determine the effect of different doses of Denak powder on growth of probiotic bacteria in milk and yoghurt, first lyophilized bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus was added to 1 liter of low fat sterilized milk and was considered as control. Denak powder at the concentrations of 0.5, 1 and 1.5% were added to the samples and incubated until acidity reached 40 degrees Dornic and then left in refrigerator. Similar procedure was applied to the bacteria Bifidobacterium bifidum. The results of this experiment indicate the positive correlation between increased bacterial growth and increased Denak concentration. The investigation showed that the yoghurt containing 1% Denak powder had the best for taste, color, and insolubility. The sample with 1.5% Denak powder in milk and yoghurt had greater viscosity than the other samples investigated. The shelf lives of products were determined to be 21 days during which the bacterial count decreased but not less than 10(9). All the results suggest that Denak (Oliveria decumbens Vent) promoted the metabolism of lactic acid bacteria in milk and yoghurt. According to these findings, addition of Denak powder to milk and yoghurt can be recommended to take advantage of their beneficial properties on human health attributed to antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Microencapsulation of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis and Lactobacillus acidophilus in cocoa butter using spray chilling technology.
AB  - In the present study, the cells of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (BI-01) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (LAC-04) were encapsulated in cocoa butter using spray-chilling technology. Survival assays were conducted to evaluate the resistance of the probiotics to the spray-chilling process, their resistance to the simulated gastric and intestinal fluids (SGF and SIF), and their stability during 90 days of storage. The viability of the cells was not affected by microencapsulation. The free and encapsulated cells of B. animalis subsp. lactis were resistant to both SGF and SIF. The micro-encapsulated cells of L. acidophilus were more resistant to SGF and SIF than the free cells; the viability of the encapsulated cells was enhanced by 67%, while the free cells reached the detection limit of the method (10(3) CFU/g). The encapsulated probiotics were unstable when they were stored at 20 degrees C. The population of encapsulated L. acidophilus decreased drastically when they were stored at 7 degrees C; only 20% of cells were viable after 90 days of storage. The percentage of viable cells of the encapsulated B. animalis subsp.lactis, however, was 72% after the same period of storage. Promising results were obtained when the microparticles were stored at -18 degrees C; the freeze granted 90 days of shelf life to the encapsulated cells. These results suggest that the spray-chilling process using cocoa butter as carrier protects L. acidophilus from gastrointestinal fluids. However, the viability of the cells during storage must be improved.
TI  - Microencapsulation of Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 by spray-drying using sweet  whey and skim milk as encapsulating materials.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of encapsulating material on encapsulation yield, resistance to passage through simulated gastrointestinal conditions, and viability of Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 during storage. Microparticles were produced from reconstituted sweet whey or skim milk (30% total solids) inoculated with a suspension of L. acidophilus La-5 (1% vol/vol) and subjected to spray-drying at inlet and outlet temperatures of 180 degrees C and 85 to 95 degrees C, respectively. The samples were packed, vacuum-sealed, and stored at 4 degrees C and 25 degrees C. Encapsulation yield, moisture content, and resistance of microencapsulated L. acidophilus La-5 compared with free cells (control) during exposure to in vitro gastrointestinal conditions (pH 2.0 and 7.0) were evaluated. Viability was assessed after 0, 7, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90d of storage. The experiments were repeated 3 times and data were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey test for the comparison between means. The encapsulating material did not significantly affect encapsulation yield, average diameter, or moisture of the particles, which averaged 76.58+/-4.72%, 12.94+/-0.78mum, and 4.53+/-0.32%, respectively. Both microparticle types were effective in protecting the probiotic during gastrointestinal simulation, and the skim milk microparticles favored an increase in viability of L. acidophilus La-5. Regardless of the encapsulating material and temperature of storage, viability of the microencapsulated L. acidophilus La-5 decreased on average 0.43 log cfu/g at the end of 90d of storage, remaining higher than 10(6)cfu/g.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus: characterization of the species and application in food production.
AB  - L. acidophilus is a homofermentative, microaerophilic, short chain gram positive  microorganism with rod morphology having its bacteriocins belonging to class II a. Several bacteriocins of L. acidophilus have been isolated and characterized. These are structurally similar, but their molecular weight varies as well as their spectrum of antimicrobial activity. They exhibit important technical properties, i.e., thermostability and retaining of activity at a wide pH range along with strong inhibitory actions against food spoilage and pathogenic bacteria make them an important class of biopreservatives. L. acidophilus can be added as an adjunct in many food fermentation processes contributing to unique taste, flavor, and texture. It also preserves the products by producing lactic acid and bacteriocins. A lot of new information regarding the bacteriocins of L. acidophilus has emerged during the last few years. In this review, an attempt has been made to summarize and discuss all the available information regarding the sources of bacteriocins production, their characteristics, and their antimicrobial action along with their application.
TI  - Antimicrobial and anti-adhesive properties of biosurfactant produced by lactobacilli isolates, biofilm formation and aggregation ability.
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial and anti-adhesive properties of biosurfactant extracted from ten lactobacilli species isolated from Egyptian dairy products. The produced biosurfactants showed distinct antimicrobial and anti-adhesive activities against several pathogenic microorganisms. Furthermore, lactobacilli isolates were studied for biofilm formation and lactic acid production in different growth media. All lactobacilli isolates produced biofilm on polystyrene surface in all media tested to different degrees. L. acidophilus showed the highest biofilm formation in Rogosa medium. However, the highest lactic acid production was recorded by L. brevis (39.63 g/L), followed by L. reuteri (33.32 g/L) in MRS medium. Evaluation based on in vitro studies including auto-aggregation and co-aggregation with three pathogenic bacterial strains was further analyzed. All lactobacilli isolates tested were able to auto-aggregate (ranging from 51.12% to 78.17% assessed at 5 h of incubation). The lactobacilli isolates co-aggregate with the tested bacterial strains to different degrees; among them L. delbrueckii showed the highest scores of co-aggregation with Candida albicans ATC70014, reaching 59.37%. The aggregation ability exhibited by the isolated lactobacilli, together with the antimicrobial and anti-adhesive properties observed for their biosurfactants, opens future prospects for their use against microorganisms responsible for diseases and infections and as effective probiotic strains.
TI  - H(2)O(2) production in species of the Lactobacillus acidophilus group: a central  role for a novel NADH-dependent flavin reductase.
AB  - Hydrogen peroxide production is a well-known trait of many bacterial species associated with the human body. In the presence of oxygen, the probiotic lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC 533 excretes up to 1 mM H(2)O(2), inducing growth stagnation and cell death. Disruption of genes commonly assumed to be involved in H(2)O(2) production (e.g., pyruvate oxidase, NADH oxidase, and lactate oxidase) did not affect this. Here we describe the purification of a novel NADH-dependent flavin reductase encoded by two highly similar genes (LJ_0548 and LJ_0549) that are conserved in lactobacilli belonging to the Lactobacillus acidophilus group. The genes are predicted to encode two 20-kDa proteins containing flavin mononucleotide (FMN) reductase conserved domains. Reductase activity requires FMN, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), or riboflavin and is specific for NADH and not NADPH. The Km for FMN is 30 +/- 8 muM, in accordance with its proposed in vivo role in H(2)O(2) production. Deletion of the encoding genes in L. johnsonii led to a 40-fold reduction of hydrogen peroxide formation. H(2)O(2) production in this mutant could only be restored by in trans complementation of both genes. Our work identifies a novel, conserved NADH-dependent flavin reductase that is prominently involved in H(2)O(2) production in L. johnsonii.
TI  - Short communication: survival of the characteristic microbiota in probiotic fermented camel, cow, goat, and sheep milks during refrigerated storage.
AB  - The objective of this study was to monitor the viability during storage of Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 (A), Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis BB-12 (B), and Streptococcus thermophilus CHCC 742/2130 (T) in probiotic cultured dairy foods made from pasteurized camel, cow, goat, and sheep milks fermented by an ABT-type culture. The products manufactured were stored at 4 degrees C for 42d. Microbiological analyses were performed at weekly intervals. Streptococcus thermophilus CHCC 742/2130 was the most numerous culture component in all 4 products both at the beginning and at the end of storage. The viable counts of streptococci showed no significant decline in fermented camel milk throughout the entire storage period. The initial numbers of Lb. acidophilus LA-5 were over 2 orders of magnitude lower than those of Strep. thermophilus CHCC 742/2130. With the progress of time, a slow and constant decrease was observed in lactobacilli counts; however, the final viability percentages of this organism did not differ significantly in the probiotic fermented milks tested. The cultured dairy foods made from cow, sheep, and goat milks had comparable B. animalis ssp. lactis BB-12 counts on d 0, exceeding by approximately 0.5 log10 cycle those in the camel milk-based product. No significant losses occurred in viability of bifidobacteria in fermented camel, cow, and sheep milks during 6wk of refrigerated storage. In conclusion, all 4 varieties of milk proved to be suitable raw materials for the manufacture of ABT-type fermented dairy products that were microbiologically safe and beneficial for human consumption. It was suggested that milk from small ruminants be increasingly used to produce probiotic fermented dairy foods. The development of camel milk-based probiotic cultured milks appears to be even more promising because new markets could thus be conquered. It must be emphasized, however, that further microbiological and sensory studies, technology development activities, and market research are needed before such food products can be successfully commercialized.
TI  - [Identification and biological properties of intestinal lactic acid bacteria isolated from aged women].
AB  - The strains of lactic acid bacteria have been isolated from the intestine of older women. These strains were identified and their biological activity was studied. It has been established that Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. plantarum, L. salivarius var. salivarius and Enterococcus faecium had the highest antagonistic activity against opportunistic microorganisms. It has been revealed, that the adhesive properties and antibiotic resistance of the tested cultures had strain specificity. Most of the isolates were highly adhesive and did not produce hemolysins.
TI  - In vitro anti-inflammatory activity of selected oxalate-degrading probiotic bacteria: potential applications in the prevention and treatment of hyperoxaluria.
AB  - Oxalate (Ox) is a very common component of the human diet, capable to collect in  the renal tissue and bind calcium to form calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystals. A supersaturation of CaOx crystal may cause nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis. The inflammation derived from the CaOx crystal accumulation, together with innate or secondary renal alterations, could strongly affect the renal function. In this case a consumption of probiotics with either oxalate-degrading activity at intestinal level and systemic anti-inflammatory activity could be an alternative approach to treat the subjects with excess of urinary oxalate excretion. 11 strains of lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria), already included in the list of bacteria safe for the human use, were investigated for their capability to degrade oxalate by mean of RP-HPLC-UV method and modulate inflammation in an in vitro model system based on peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Four promising bacterial strains (Lactobacillus plantarum PBS067, Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-14, Bifidobacterium breve PBS077, Bifidobacterium longum PBS078) were identified as innovative biological tools for the prevention and the therapeutic treatment of hyperoxaluria and the inflammatory events associated to the Ox accumulation. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The oxalate-degrading activity of some probiotics and their capability to modulate the release of inflammation mediators could be exploited as a new nutraceutical and therapeutic approach for the treatment of oxalate accumulation and the related inflammatory state.
TI  - Isolation and identification of microorganisms including lactic acid bacteria and their use in microbial deacidification of wines from domestic vineyards.
AB  - The aim of this study was to identify various bacteria isolated from grapes and their wines. Additionally we investigated the capacity of lactic acid bacteria for microbiological deacidification of wines produced in Poland. We have identified Oenococcus oeni, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii. During the microbial deacidification process, we observed decreases of total acidity and increases of volatile acidity, with statistically significant changes noted for O. oeni in Marechal Foch and Seyval Blanc, and for Lb. acidophilus in Frontenac. On the other hand, a statistically significant increase in pH was observed in Marechal Foch and Seyval Blanc following deacidification by O. oeni.
TI  - Cost-benefit analysis of the probiotic treatment of children hospitalized for acute diarrhea in Bangkok, Thailand.
AB  - We studied the cost-benefit of using probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum) in the treatment of 106 children hospitalized with acute diarrhea using a double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled trial. The median length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in the probiotics group than in the controlled group (2 versus 3 days, p=0.049), but the median duration of diarrhea and direct medical costs were not significantly different (4 versus 5 days, p=0.068 and 4,418.75 versus 4,778.75 Thai Baht, p=0.342). Taking into consideration parental income loss, a non-significant lower expense was seen in the probiotics group (6,800.33 versus 7,970.92 Thai Baht, p=0.177). A greater cost-benefit with the probiotic treatment is probable, but was not statistically significant in this small study. In conclusion, the probiotics tested shortened the duration of hospitalization of children with diarrhea but the total expenses were not different.
TI  - Antistaphylococcal action of lacto- and bifidobacteria and interleukn-2.
AB  - Antistaphylococcal action of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus IMV B-7281, L. acidophilus LMV B-7279 and Bifidobacterium animalis VKB as well as interleukin-2 (IL-2) has been determined on the model of experimental staphylococcal infection in mice. It has been established that peroral administration of certain probiotic strains of lacto- and bifidobacteria or composition L. acidophilus LMV B-7279--L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus IMV B-7281 with IL-2 to mice favored the reducing of terms of staphylococcus persistence in the kidneys of experimental mice. The studied schemes are promising for treatment of patients with surgical infection.
TI  - Characterization of surface layer proteins and its role in probiotic properties of three Lactobacillus strains.
AB  - The objective of this study was the characterization of the surface layer proteins (SLPs) and their functional role in the probiotic activity of Lactobacillus helveticus fb213, L. acidophilus fb116 and L. acidophilus fb214. SLPs were extracted and identified by SDS-PAGE, circular dichroism spectra and LC-MS analysis. The results revealed that the molecular masses of the three proteins were 49.7 kDa, 46.0 kDa and 44.6 kDa, respectively. The secondary structures and amino acid compositions of the three proteins were found to be similar. After removing SLPs, the survival of the three lactobacilli in simulated gastric and intestinal juices was reduced by 2-3log as compared with survival of the intact cells. And the adhesion ability of the three strains to HT-29 cells decreased by 61%, 65% and 92%, respectively. SLPs also inhibited the adhesion and invasion of Escherichia coli ATCC 43893 to HT-29 cells. These results suggest that SLPs are advantageous barriers for lactobacilli in the gastrointestinal tract, and these proteins help make it possible for lactobacilli to serve their probiotic functions.
TI  - Shelf life stability of lactobacilli encapsulated in raspberry powder: insights into non-dairy probiotics.
AB  - AIM: Study the shelf-life quality changes in raspberry juice with encapsulated lactobacilli (Lactobacillus rhamnosus NRRL B-4495 and Lactobacillus acidophilus NRRL B-442) obtained by spray drying and understand the various factors involved. METHODS AND RESULTS: Raspberry powder was obtained from spray drying lactobacilli and raspberry juice with maltodextrin as an additive. Shelf life of the powder was analyzed over a period of 30 d. Acid and bile tolerance and antibiotic resistance was compared before and after spray drying. Water activity, survival, and scanning electron microscope images were also measured during the shelf life. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: A combination of processing conditions: inlet temperature ( degrees C), maltodextrin to juice solids ratio and inlet feed rate (ml/min) during spray drying had a significant role on the survival of lactobacilli during shelf life. Refrigerated storage provided a higher shelf-life stability with regards to CFU/g (as high as 84% on day 0 and 98% retention by the end of 30 d) compared to room temperature storage. Probiotic properties during shelf life are affected by the processing conditions and encapsulated food matrix. Thus, understanding these aspects in vitro during shelf life gives us a brief insight into the future of non-dairy probiotics.
TI  - Combination of probiotics and antibiotics in the prevention of recurrent urinary  tract infection in children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We examined the preventive effect of probiotic and antibiotics versus  antibiotics alone, in children with recurrent urinary tract infections (RUTI) in a preliminary randomized clinical trial. METHODS: Between March 2007 and April 2011, children with the history of RUTI and unilateral vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) were randomly assigned to receive concomitant probiotic and antibiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium lactis, 10(7)/ml, as 0.25 ml/kg three times a day regimen in addition to Nitrofurantoin, 1mg/kg daily (group I). In group II, all children received conventional prophylactic antibiotics alone (Nitrofurantoin, 1 mg/kg daily). Randomization was performed via using the random numerals table in a 1:1 manner with stratification by sex, age and grade of reflux. The urine examinations were done monthly and the incidence of UTI was evaluated in these two groups. FINDINGS: Forty-one children (age: 8.3+/-3.1 years) in group I and 44 children (age: 8.0+/-3.0 years) in group II were compared. During the course of three years, 39% in group I and 50% of participants in group II experienced RUTIs (P=0.4). Incidences of UTI - febrile and afebrile - reduced in both groups without any significant differences after two years of prophylaxis. Also, incidence of afebrile UTIs did not significantly differ (0.51+/-1.30 and 0.81+/-1.41 respectively, P =0.3); however, the incidence of febrile UTIs in particular were lower in group I (0.00+/-0.00 versus 0.13+/-0.40, P =0.03) in the last year. CONCLUSION: The consumption of probiotic and antibiotics in children with RUTI is safe and more effective in reducing the incidence of febrile UTI in comparison to prophylactic antibiotics alone.
TI  - Molecular Cloning, Expression of minD Gene from Lactobacillus acidophilus VTCC-B-871 and Analyses to Identify Lactobacillus rhamnosus PN04 from Vietnam Hottuynia cordata Thunb.
AB  - The minD gene encoding an inhibitor cell division MinD homolog from Lactobacillus acidophilus VTCC-B-871 was cloned. We showed that there were 97 % homology between minD genes of L. acidophilus VTCC-B-871 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactobacillus rhamnosus Lc705. Based on the analysis of the DNA sequence data from the L. rhamnosus genome project and sequenced minD gene of L. acidophilus VTCC-B-871, a pair of primers was designed to identified the different minD genes from L. acidophilus ATCC 4356, L. rhamnosus ATCC 11443. Besides, the polymerase chain reaction product of minD gene was also obtained in L. rhamnosus PN04, a strain was isolated from Vietnamese Hottuynia cordata Thunb. In addition, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of MinD homologs from L. acidophilus VTCC-B-871 with the other strains and compared the predicted three-dimension structure of L. acidophilus VTCC-B-871 MinD with Escherichia coli MinD, there are similarity that showed evolution of these strains. The overexpression of L. acidophilus VTCC-B-871 MinD in E. coli led to cell filamentation in IPTG and morphology changes in different sugar stresses, interestingly. The present study is the first report characterizing the Lactobacilus MinD homolog that will be useful in probiotic field.
TI  - Potentialities of newly isolated Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus sp for curd  preparation and a comparative study of its physico-chemical parameters with other marketed curds.
AB  - Two Bacillus sp. were isolated from the local fermented milk and identified on the basis 16S rRNA sequence profile as Bacillus subtilis AKL1 and by biochemical process as Lactobacillus acidophilus AKL2. These isolates were used as fresh inoculums for curd preparation individually and in combinations. Different physico-chemical and therapeutic properties of the newly prepared curd were examined and compared with marketed local (sweet and sour) and branded (Mother Dairy and Thackar) curds. The total hydrolyzed peptides, free amino acids, lactic acid were significantly higher, whereas, total solid, ash content, syneresis and free reducing sugar were lower in the curd prepared by a mixture of AKL1 and AKL2 (0.5:0.5, v/v). The antioxidant activity against ABTS+, DPPH8, OH* and Fe3+ were also higher in the newly formulated curd. Polyphenols (85.5 microg/g), flavonoids (12.5 microg/g) and free aromatic amino acids contents were also higher in AKL1+AKL2. All these components prevent excess protein oxidation that was revealed by SDS-PAGE. The curd also exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against some entero-pathogens like Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Shigella dysentery, Vibrio cholerae and Staphylococcus aureus. It can be concluded that the combination of these Lactobacillus sp. will be a fruitful inoculum for the preparation of curd having better health promoting effects.
TI  - Effects of salt concentration and pH on structural and functional properties of Lactobacillus acidophilus: FT-IR spectroscopic analysis.
AB  - The effects of sodium chloride concentration and varying pH levels on the structural and functional properties of Lactobacillus acidophilus were investigated. Reconstituted skim milk was inoculated with Lb. acidophilus at varying salt concentrations (0, 1, 2, 5 and 10% NaCl) and pH levels (4.0, 5.0 and 6.0) and ACE-inhibitory activity and proteolytic activity were determined and the viable cell count was enumerated after 24h of fermentation at 37 degrees C. The degree of proteolysis exhibited an increase with higher salt concentration at pH 5.0 and 6.0. ACE-inhibitory activity was found to be the highest at pH 5.0 at all salt concentrations. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results demonstrated significant changes occurring beyond 2% NaCl particularly at low pH (4.0). The findings revealed that significant changes occurred in amide I and amide III regions when Lb. acidophilus was subjected to varying salt concentrations.
TI  - Antifungal activity of lactobacilli and its relationship with 3-phenyllactic acid production.
AB  - In this study, 13 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains (including 5 Lactobacillus casei, 2 Lactobacillus rhamnosus, 2 Lactobacillus fermentum, 1 Lactobacillus acidophilus, 1 Lactobacillus plantarum, 1 Lactobacillus sakei, and 1 Lactobacillus reuteri species) were assessed for both their antifungal activity against four food spoilage molds (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Botrytis cinerea, Penicillium expansum, and Aspergillus flavus) and their capability to produce the novel antimicrobial compound 3-phenyllactic acid (PLA). Results demonstrated that all molds were sensitive to varying degrees to the cell-free supernatants (CFS) from LAB fermentations (p<0.05), with growth inhibitions ranging from 2.65% to 66.82%. The inhibition ability of CFS was not affected by a heating treatment (121 degrees C, 20 min); however, it declined markedly when the pH of CFS was adjusted to 6.5. With the exception of L. plantarum NRRL B-4496 and L. acidophilus ATCC-4495, all other LAB strains produced PLA ranging from 0.021 to 0.275 mM. The high minimum inhibitory concentration for commercial PLA (3.01-36.10mM) suggests that it cannot be considered the only compound related with the antifungal potential of studied LAB and that synergistic effects may exist among other metabolism products.
TI  - Identification of Lactobacilli from deep carious lesions by means of species-specific PCR and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to compare MALDI-TOF results for the identification of 87 lactobacilli, isolated from soft or hard carious dentin from 70 first molars of 7- to 8-year-old children with those obtained by species-specific PCR. METHODS: The 87 isolates were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS (Microflex LT, MALDI Biotyper 3.0, Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany), using a reference data base of 4110 strains including > 90 lactobacillus species. For the identification with species-specific PCR, oligonucleotide primers (16S rRNA) specific for L. casei, L. paracasei, L. rhamnosus, L. gasseri, L. plantarum, and L. acidophilus were used; type strains served as controls. The PCR-products were separated electrophoretically on a 1.5% agarose gel and identified by their position on the gel. RESULTS: For 93% of the strains both methods produced concordant results: 40 strains were identified as L. rhamnosus, 16 as L. paracasei subsp. paracasei, 15 as L. paracasei subsp. tolerans, 4 as L. paracasei, 3 as L. gasseri, 2 as L. plantarum, and 1 as L. casei. In 4.5% of the cases the results were discordant. Of the 3 strains, not identified by species-specific PCR, 1 strain was identified by MALDI-TOF MS as L. spec. and 1 as L. parabuchneri. One strain could not be identified by either method. CONCLUSIONS: Both methods are highly sensitive. Limitations can be the precision of the primers (PCR) or the scarcity of strains from a certain habitat in the data base. Additional information is necessary for the strains without or with discordant identification.
TI  - Effect of bacterial cell-free supernatants on infectivity of norovirus surrogates.
AB  - Bacterial metabolic products were evaluated for inhibitory effects on viral propagation in cell culture. Cell-free supernatants (CFS) were prepared from growth of Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 19433, Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 13525, Escherichia coli 08, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Bacillus subtilis 168, Bacillus coagulans 185A, B. coagulans 7050, Clostridium sporogenes PA3679, and a commercial probiotic mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Streptococcus thermophilus in microbiological medium or milk. The inhibitory effects of CFS on the propagation of murine norovirus 1 and Tulane virus in RAW 264.7 and LLCMK2 cells, respectively, were evaluated in the continuous presence of CFS or after exposure of host cells to CFS. Slight inhibition of viral propagation was observed for murine norovirus and Tulane virus in the continuous presence of CFS of B. subtilis 168 and E. faecalis 19433, respectively. CFS cytotoxicity was also determined by microscopic examination. Virus persisted in the CFS that demonstrated cytotoxic effects, suggesting a lack of direct effect of CFS on virions. The viral propagation indicates a general lack of competitive inhibition by bacterial extracellular products and bears significance in understanding the persistence of virus in food and human systems shared by bacteria that are recognized for their colonization and competitive capabilities.
TI  - The structure and immunomodulatory activity on intestinal epithelial cells of the EPSs isolated from Lactobacillus helveticus sp. Rosyjski and Lactobacillus acidophilus sp. 5e2.
AB  - The Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) Lactobacillus acidophilus sp. 5e2 and Lactobacillus helveticus sp. Rosyjski both secrete exopolysaccharides (EPSs) into their surrounding environments during growth. A number of EPSs have previously been shown to exhibit immunomodulatory activity with professional immune cells, such as macrophages, but only limited studies have been reported of their interaction with intestinal epithelial cells. An investigation of the immunomodulatory potential of pure EPSs, isolated from cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus sp. 5e2 and Lactobacillus helveticus sp. Rosyjski, with the HT29-19A intestinal epithelial cell line are reported here. For the first time the structure of the EPS from Lactobacillus helveticus sp. Rosyjski which is a hetropolysaccharide with a branched pentasaccharide repeat unit containing d-glucose, d-galactose and N-acetyl-d-mannosamine is described. In response to exposure to lactobacilli EPSs HT29-19A cells produce significantly increased levels of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-8. Additionally, the EPSs differentially modulate the mRNA expression of Toll-like receptors. Finally, the pre-treatment of HT29-19A cells with the EPSs sensitises the cells to subsequent challenge with bacterial antigens. The results reported here suggest that EPSs could potentially play a role in intestinal homeostasis via a specific interaction with intestinal epithelial cells.
TI  - Comparison of two oral probiotic preparations in a randomized crossover trial highlights a potentially beneficial effect of Lactobacillus paracasei NCC2461 in patients with allergic rhinitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is promising but conflicting evidence to recommend the addition of probiotics to foods for prevention and treatment of allergy. Based on previous studies with fermented milk containing Lactobacillus paracasei NCC2461, we aimed to compare the effect of a powder form of the latter probiotic with the effect of a blend of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC SD5221 and Bifidobacterium lactis ATCC SD5219 in patients with allergic rhinitis. METHODS: A double-blind, randomized, cross-over study, involving 31 adults with allergic rhinitis to grass pollen, was performed outside the grass pollen season (registration number: NCT01233154). Subjects received each product for 4-weeks in two phases separated by a wash-out period of 6 to 8 weeks. A nasal provocation test was performed before and after each 4-week product intake period, and outcome parameters (objective and subjective clinical symptoms; immune parameters) were measured during and/or 24 hours after the test. RESULTS: Out of the 31 subject enrolled, 28 completed the study. While no effect was observed on nasal congestion (primary outcome), treatment with NCC2461 significantly decreased nasal pruritus (determined by VAS), and leukocytes in nasal fluid samples, enhanced IL-5, IL-13 and IL-10 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells in an allergen specific manner and tended to decrease IL-5 secretion in nasal fluid, in contrast to treatment with the blend of L. acidophilus and B. lactis. CONCLUSIONS: Despite short-term consumption, NCC2461 was able to reduce subjective nasal pruritus while not affecting nasal congestion in adults suffering from grass pollen allergic rhinitis. The associated decrease in nasal fluid leukocytes and IL-5 secretion, and the enhanced IL-10 secretion in an allergen specific manner may partly explain the decrease in nasal pruritus. However, somewhat unexpected systemic immune changes were also noted. These data support the study of NCC2461 consumption in a seasonal clinical trial to further demonstrate its potentially beneficial effect.
TI  - Development of an alternative culture medium for the selective enumeration of Lactobacillus casei in fermented milk.
AB  - Monitoring the populations of probiotic strains of the species Lactobacillus casei in food is required by food industries in order to assure that a minimum concentration of these organisms will be ingested by consumers. In this context, Petrifilm AC plates can be used along with selective culture media to allow the enumeration of specific groups of lactic acid bacteria. The present study aimed to assess chemical substances as selective agents for Lb. casei in order to propose a selective culture medium to be used with Petrifilm AC plates as an alternative protocol for the enumeration of probiotic strains of this species in fermented milk. Twenty-six probiotic and starter cultures (including six strains of Lb. casei) were plated on de Man Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS) agar with distinct concentrations of nalidixic acid, bile, lithium chloride, metronidazole, sodium propionate, and vancomycin. Vancomycin at 10 mg/L demonstrated selective activity for Lb. casei. In addition, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chlorine was identified as a compound that did not inhibit Lb. casei, and Petrifilm AC plates used with MRS and vancomycin at 10 mg/L (MRS-V) demonstrated more colonies of this organism when incubated under anaerobic conditions than aerobic conditions. Acidophilus milk and yoghurt were prepared, added to Lb. casei strains, and stored at 4 degrees C. Lb. casei populations were monitored using MRS-V and MRTLV by conventional plating and associated with Petrifilm AC plates. All correlation indices between counts obtained by conventional plating and Petrifilm AC were significant (p < 0.05), but the best performance was observed for growth on MRS-V. The obtained data indicate the efficiency of using MRS-V associated with Petrifilm AC plates for the enumeration of Lb. casei strains in fermented milk. However, the selective potential of this culture medium must be evaluated considering the specific strains of Lb. casei and the starter cultures inoculated in the fermented milk that requires monitoring.
TI  - Probiotic therapy: a promising strategy for the control of canine hookworm.
AB  - Canis familiaris is a domestic animal which plays an important role as a pet; however, it is very likely to develop diseases characterized by high morbidity and mortality. In this sense, there are some Ancylostomatidae species that can lead to anemia, weight loss, and abdominal pain. Therefore, the treatment with allopathic drugs is essential for eliminating the parasitism. However, the increasing occurrence of resistance to allopathic treatments stimulates the search for new therapeutic inputs, among which the probiotics stand out and are able to positively alter the intestinal microbiota and exert immunomodulatory effect. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the applicability of using species of Lactobacillus (L. acidophilus ATCC 4536, L. plantarum ATCC 8014, and L. delbrueckii UFV H2B20) to control canine ancylostomiasis. A probiotic preparation containing 1 x 10(6) CFU of each strain was administered to 10 naturally infected animals, on alternate days for 28 days. It was observed that the treatment with the probiotic preparation led to a significant reduction in EPG of feces (88.83%/ P < 0.05), as well as an increase in leukocyte and lymphocyte counts, highlighting the potential use of Lactobacillus species in the control of canine ancylostomiasis.
TI  - Benzoyl peroxide formulated polycarbophil/carbopol 934P hydrogel with selective antimicrobial activity, potentially beneficial for treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - The human vagina is colonized by a variety of indigenous microflora; in healthy individuals the predominant bacterial genus is Lactobacillus while those with bacterial vaginosis (BV) carry a variety of anaerobic representatives of the phylum Actinobacteria. In this study, we evaluated the antimicrobial activity of benzoyl peroxide (BPO) encapsulated in a hydrogel against Gardnerella vaginalis, one of the causative agents of BV, as well as indicating its safety for healthy human lactobacilli. Herein, it is shown that in well diffusion assays G. vaginalis is inhibited at 0.01% hydrogel-encapsulated BPO and that the tested Lactobacillus spp. can tolerate concentrations of BPO up to 2.5%. In direct contact assays (cells grown in a liquid culture containing hydrogel with 1% BPO or BPO particles), we demonstrated that hydrogels loaded with 1% BPO caused 6-log reduction of G. vaginalis. Conversely, three of the tested Lactobacillus spp. were not inhibited while L. acidophilus growth was slightly delayed. The rheological properties of the hydrogel formulation were probed using oscillation frequency sweep, oscillation shear stress sweep, and shear rate sweep. This shows the gel to be suitable for vaginal application and that the encapsulation of BPO did not alter rheological properties.
TI  - Dental caries and vaccination strategy against the major cariogenic pathogen, Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Although dental caries is a global problem in modern times, no vaccines are available for preventing these diseases. Among the bacterial pathogens that cause dental caries, including Streptococcus mutans, S. sobrinus, and Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Actinomyces viscosus, S. mutans is the most prominent and prevalent species. During the past, much effort has been focused on developing vaccines against S. mutans. Early attempts used fixed whole cells of S. mutans, but later it was found that serological cross-reactivity between heart tissue antigens and Streptococcus antigens occurs in patients resulting in rheumatic fever. Recently, with the aid of molecular biology, the genome sequences of S. mutans strains are available, which can greatly accelerate the development of subunit vaccines. Many desirable candidate subunit vaccines have been or are going to be evaluated in either experimental animal models or in human clinical trials. In this review article, we summarized the updated progress made in deciphering the mechanisms of disease development and the achievements of vaccine research against S. mutans.
TI  - Peptidoglycan hydrolases as species-specific markers to differentiate Lactobacillus helveticus from Lactobacillus gallinarum and other closely related homofermentative lactobacilli.
AB  - We propose a new method that allows accurate discrimination of Lactobacillus helveticus from other closely related homofermentative lactobacilli, especially Lactobacillus gallinarum. This method is based on the amplification by PCR of two peptidoglycan hydrolytic genes, Lhv_0190 and Lhv_0191. These genes are ubiquitous and show high homology at the intra-species level. The PCR method gave two specific PCR products, of 542 and 747 bp, for 25 L. helveticus strains coming from various sources. For L. gallinarum, two amplicons were obtained, the specific 542 bp amplicon and another one with a size greater than 1,500 bp. No specific PCR products were obtained for 12 other closely related species of lactobacilli, including the L. acidophilus complex, L. delbrueckii, and L. ultunensis. The developed PCR method provided rapid, precise, and easy identification of L. helveticus. Moreover, it enabled differentiation between the two closely phylogenetically related species L. helveticus and L. gallinarum.
TI  - Advantageous direct quantification of viable closely related probiotics in petit-suisse cheeses under in vitro gastrointestinal conditions by Propidium Monoazide--qPCR.
AB  - Species-specific Quantitative Real Time PCR (qPCR) alone and combined with the use of propidium monoazide (PMA) were used along with the plate count method to evaluate the survival of the probiotic strains Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bb-12, and the bacteriocinogenic and potentially probiotic strain Lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei 2a in synbiotic (F1) and probiotic (F2) petit-suisse cheeses exposed throughout shelf-life to in vitro simulated gastrointestinal tract conditions. The three strains studied showed a reduction in their viability after the 6 h assay. Bb-12 displayed the highest survival capacity, above 72.6 and 74.6% of the initial populations, respectively, by plate count and PMA-qPCR, maintaining population levels in the range or above 6 log CFU/g. The prebiotic mix of inulin and FOS did not offer any additional protection for the strains against the simulated gastrointestinal environment. The microorganisms' populations were comparable among the three methods at the initial time of the assay, confirming the presence of mainly viable and culturable cells. However, with the intensification of the stress induced throughout the various stages of the in vitro test, the differences among the methods increased. The qPCR was not a reliable enumeration method for the quantification of intact bacterial populations, mixed with large numbers of injured and dead bacteria, as confirmed by the scanning electron microscopy results. Furthermore, bacteria plate counts were much lower (P<0.05) than with the PMA-qPCR method, suggesting the accumulation of stressed or dead microorganisms unable to form colonies. The use of PMA overcame the qPCR inability to differentiate between dead and alive cells. The combination of PMA and species-specific qPCR in this study allowed a quick and unequivocal way of enumeration of viable closely related species incorporated into probiotic and synbiotic petit-suisse cheeses and under stress conditions.
TI  - Long-Term Use of Probiotic-Containing Yogurts Is a Safe Way to Prevent Helicobacter pylori: Based on a Mongolian Gerbil's Model.
AB  - Background. The suppression of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) decreases H. pylori-related diseases. The probiotics have an inhibitory effect on H. pylori. Aim. We investigated the effects of long-term use of yogurt on H. pylori based on Mongolian gerbils' model. Materials and Methods. Yogurt (containing a supplement of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium lactis, etc.) was used. Forty-six gerbils were divided into five groups. All groups were inoculated with H. pylori for 5 to 8 weeks. The yogurt was given as follows: Group (Gr.) A: from 1st to 4th week; Gr. B from 5th to 8th week; Gr. C: from 17th week to sacrifice; Gr. D: from 5th week to sacrifice. Gerbils were sacrificed on the 52nd week. Histology was evaluated according to the Sydney system. Results. The positive rates of H. pylori were 60% (Gr. A), 75% (Gr. B), 67% (Gr. C), 44% (Gr. D), and 100% (Gr. E). Gr. D showed lower inflammatory score. Only Gr. E (60%) had intestinal metaplasia. Gr. D showed higher IL-10 and lower TNF- alpha expression than Gr. E. Conclusion. Long-term intake of yogurt could decrease H. pylori infection. The long-term use of yogurt would be an alternative strategy to manage H. pylori infection.
TI  - [Probiotics improve obesity-associated dyslipidemia and insulin resistance in high-fat diet-fed rats].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of probiotics (bifidobacterium breve and lactobacillus acidophilus) on serum lipid, serum insulin and insulin resistance in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese rats. METHODS: Fifty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to a control (n=10) and a high fat diet groups (n=40) and were fed with standard diet and HFD respectively. Four weeks later, thirty-six HFD-induced obese rats were randomly administered with normal saline (NS), bifidobacterium breve and lactobacillus acidophilus daily (n=12 each). Four weeks later, body lengths, body weights and abdomen circumference of rats were measured, blood lipid, glucose and insulin levels were measured, and Lee's index and insulin resistance index were calculated. RESULTS: Body weight, abdomen circumference, Lee's index, fasting glucose, triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein (LDL) in the NS-treated HFD group were significantly higher than the control group (P<0.05). The bifidobacterium breve and lactobacillus acidophilus-treated groups had significantly lower levels of body weight, abdomen circumference, Lee's index, fasting glucose, TC, TG and LDL than the NS-treated HFD group (P<0.05), but the levels of the parameters in the bifidobacterium breve and lactobacillus acidophilus-treated groups were significantly higher than the control group (P<0.05). High density lipoprotein (HDL) and insulin sensitivity index in the NS-treated HFD group were significantly lower than the control group (P<0.05). Bifidobacterium breve and lactobacillus acidophilus treatment dramatically increased HDL levels and insulin sensitivity index compared with the NS-treated HFD group (P<0.05), although the levels of the two parameters did not reach to the levels of the control group. There were significant differences in the levels of fasting insulin, insulin resistance index and insulin secretion index between the bifidobacterium breve and lactobacillus acidophilus groups (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium breve can decrease serum levels of lipid and glucose and improve insulin resistance in obese rats. Bifidobacterium breve seems to be more effective on attenuating insulin resistance than lactobacillus acidophilus.
TI  - [Identification of lactic acid bacteria in commercial yogurt and their antibiotic resistance].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in commercial yogurts and investigate their antibiotic resistance. METHODS: LABs were cultured from 5 yogurt brands and the isolates were identified at the species level by 16S rRNA sequence. Genotyping was performed by repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR (rep-PCR). The sensitivity to 7 antibiotics was tested for all LAB isolates by Kirby-Bauer paper diffusion (K-B method). Meanwhile, 9 antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), including erythromycin resistance genes (ermA and ermB) and tetracycline resistance genes (tetM, tetK, tetS, tetQ, tetO, tetL and tetW), were detected by PCR amplification in the identified LAB isolates. The PCR products were confirmed by sequencing. RESULTS: Total 100 LABs were isolated, including 23 Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, 26 Lactobacillus casei, 30 Streptococcus thermophilus, 5 Lactobacillus acidophilus, 6 Lactobacillus plantarum, and 10 Lactobacillus paracasei. The drug susceptibility test shows that all 100 isolates were resistant to gentamicin and streptomycin, 42 isolates were resistant to vancomycin, and on the contrary all were sensitive to cefalexin, erythromycin, tetracycline and oxytetracycline. Moreover, 5 ARGs were found in the 28 sequencing confirmed isolates, ermB gene was detected in 8 isolates, tet K in 4 isolates, tetL in 2 isolates, tetM in 4 isolates, tetO in 2 isolates. erm A, tet S, tet Q and tet W genes were not detected in the isolates. Antibiotic resistance genes were found in 53.57% (15/28) sequenced isolates, 2 -3 antibiotic resistance genes were detected in 4 isolates of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. CONCLUSIONS: Some LABs were not labeled in commercial yogurt products. Antibiotic resistance genes tend to be found in the starter culture of L. delbrueckii ssp. Bulgaricus and S. thermophilus. All the LAB isolates were sensitive to erythromycin and tetracycline, even though some carried erythromycin and/or tetracycline resistance genes. We proved again that LAB could carry antibiotic resistance gene(s) though it is sensitive to antibiotics.
TI  - [Effect of metabolites of H2O2-producing lactobacilli on functional activity of lysozyme].
AB  - AIM: Study the effect of metabolites of H2O2-producing lactobacilli on enzymatic  and bactericidal activity of lysozyme. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 9 H2O2-producing vaginal lactobacilli, Micrococcus luteus NCTC 2665, Escherichia coli State Institute of Standardization and Control No 240367, Lactobacillus acidophilus Institute of Cellular and Intracellular Symbiosis No 37 were used. Ability of lactobacilli to produce H2O2 was evaluated by oxidation of tetramethylbenzidine by peroxidase. Lysozyme was modified by mixing with equal volumes of lactobacilli metabolites, metabolites of H2O2-producing vaginal lactobacilli previously treated with catalase were used in control. Lysozyme enzymatic activity was determined by speed of M. luteus lysis, bactericidal--by survivability of E. coli in Endo medium and L. acidophilus--in MRS medium. RESULTS: Decrease of enzymatic activity of lysozyme due to its contact with H2O2-producing lactobacilli metabolites was detected. This effect is accompanied by growth of bactericidal activity of lysozyme against E. coli and decrease against L. acidophilus. The degree of changes of enzymatic and bactericidal activity of lysozyme by lactobacilli metabolites depended on concentration of hydrogen peroxide in them. CONCLUSION: Modification of lysozyme by H2O2-producing lactobacilli metabolites resulting in opposite changes of its activity against autochthonous and allchthonous bacteria is one of the mechanisms of formation of stable microbial biocenosis in human organism.
TI  - Effect of probiotics on biomarkers of cardiovascular disease: implications for heart-healthy diets.
AB  - The objectives of this article are to review clinical trials that have examined the effects of probiotics on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and to assess the potential of probiotic intake as a therapeutic lifestyle change (TLC) dietary option. Twenty-six clinical studies and two meta-analyses are reviewed. Significant LDL-C reductions were observed for four probiotic strains: Lactobacillus reuteri NCIMB 30242, Enterococcus faecium, and the combination of Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12. Two synbiotics, L. acidophilus CHO-220 plus inulin and L. acidophilus plus fructo-oligosaccharides, also decreased LDL-C. Of the probiotics examined, L. reuteri NCIMB 30242 was found to best meet TLC dietary requirements by 1) significantly reducing LDL-C and total cholesterol, with robustness similar to that of existing TLC dietary options, 2) improving other coronary heart disease risk factors, such as inflammatory biomarkers, and 3) having "generally recognized as safe" (GRAS) status. Based on these results, the probiotic L. reuteri NCIMB 30242 is a viable candidate both for future TLC dietary studies and as a potential option for inclusion in TLC dietary recommendations.
TI  - Individual responses of mother sows to a probiotic Enterococcus faecium strain lead to different microbiota composition in their offspring.
AB  - Pregnant gilts were fed the probiotic Enterococcus faecium NCIMB10415 (SF68) one  month before birth of piglets. DNA extracts of sow faeces taken in weekly intervals as well as extracts from the intestine of their offspring during the suckling period at 12 and 26 days of life were analysed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and quantitative PCR. DGGE profiles of faecal bacterial communities from three out of six probiotic-fed sows were distinctly different from the control and other probiotic-fed sows at all time points after probiotic supplementation. The probiotic-fed sows and their offspring were therefore divided into non-responder (n=3) and responder (n=3) groups. The probiotic strain significantly increased faecal lactobacilli cell numbers in mother sows, which could be assigned to a significant increase of Lactobacillus amylovorus and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Responding sows showed a more pronounced increase than non-responding sows. Similarly, suckling piglets from non-responding and responding sows showed numeric and significant differences for different bacterial groups and species. DGGE profiles of suckling piglets from responding sows also grouped more closely than profiles from control animals. Non-metric multiscaling of suckling piglets showed the same tendency for suckling piglets, but not for post-weaning piglets. This study showed that the probiotic E. faecium strain modified the faecal microbiota of sows. This modification is carried over to their offspring, but leads to changes that do not mirror the quantitative composition in the mother sow. Individual variations in the bacterial composition of mother sows before probiotic feed intake may influence the impact of a probiotic in sows and their offspring.
TI  - Probiotic supplement consumption alters cytokine production from peripheral blood mononuclear cells: a preliminary study using healthy individuals.
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the effect of daily probiotic supplementation upon the immune profile of healthy participants by the assessment of ex vivo cytokine production. Twenty healthy adult volunteers received a multi-strain probiotic supplement consisting of two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus (CUL60 and CUL21), Bifidobacterium lactis (CUL34) and Bifidobacterium bifidum (CUL20) and fructooligosaccharide for 12 weeks. Blood samples were collected at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and cultured ex vivo in the presence or absence of lipopolysaccharide and cytokine production was assessed. Postintervention, a significant decrease in the production of interleukin-6 and interleukin-1beta was apparent when PBMCs were incubated in the presence of lipopolysaccharide, whilst a significant increase in IL-10 and transforning growth factor-beta production was seen when the cells were incubated without an additional stimulus. This preliminary study demonstrates the potential of a multi-strain probiotic supplement to alter the immune response as demonstrated by changes in ex vivo cytokine production. Such results demonstrate the potential benefit of probiotic supplementation for healthy individuals and warrants further investigation.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of fractions and subfractions of Elaeagia utilis against microorganisms of importance in dental caries.
AB  - Dental caries is a multifactorial infectious disease that leads to the destruction of dental hard tissue. The main goal of research into medicinal plants is to seek compounds with antimicrobial activity for subsequent use in prevention strategies and control of infectious diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of fractions and subfractions obtained from Elaeagia utilis against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus and Lactobacillus acidophilus. The plant material was collected in the town of Alban (Cundinamarca, Colombia), which is located at an altitude of 2245 meters above sea level. Two extracts were obtained by cold maceration of E. utilis leaves in (a) petroleum ether extract and (b) ethanol extract. Fractions were obtained from the petroleum ether extract by column vacuum chromatography, and from the ethanol extract by continuous liquid/liquid partitioning. The antimicrobial activity of fractions and subfractions was evaluated by the well diffusion method. At a concentration of 10 mg/well, several fractions from both extracts showed antimicrobial activity against S. mutans, S. sobrinus and L. acidophilus. Among the ethanol extract fractions, the dichloromethane fraction had notably greater antimicrobial activity. It was sub-partitioned, yielding three subfractions with inhibitory activity, of which the most active was MeOH: H2O (Bp) with minimum inhibitory concentration 0.1 mg/well on the 3 study bacteria. Terpenes, sesquiterpenlactones and simple phenolic compounds were identified in it. In conclusion, this study shows the antimicrobial potential of fractions and subfractions obtained from extracts of E. utilis leaves against bacteria that are important in dental caries.
TI  - Effects of probiotics on the recurrence of bacterial vaginosis: a review.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common cause of genital discomfort in women in reproductive ages, which causes many complications. Bacterial vaginosis is usually treated by metronidazole and clindamycin. However, this protocol does not prevent its recurrence, which is a main complaint of the patients. The number of lactobacilli in the vagina of women with BV is significantly lower than that in healthy women. Hence, efforts have been made to normalize vaginal flora by oral or vaginal administration of lactobacilli. The objective of the present study was to review clinical evidences available regarding the efficacy of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of BV. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Published randomized controlled trials were searched in PubMed, Science Direct, and the Cochrane Database between 1990 and 2011. Search terms included bacterial vaginosis, urinary tract infection, lactobacillus, and probiotics. RESULTS: Orally consumed probiotics are believed to ascend to the vaginal tract after they are excreted from the rectum; vaginal administration allows for direct replacement of the probiotics for unhealthy vaginal microbiota and occupation of specific adhesion sites at the epithelial surface of the urinary tract, which consequently results in maintenance of a low pH and production of antimicrobial substances like acids and hydrogen peroxide. Receiving Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1, and Lactobacillus fermentum RC-14 at a dose of at least 10 CFU/day for 2 months has been shown to present the patients with better results. CONCLUSIONS: Although the results of different studies are controversial, most studies have been in favor of the probiotics in the prevention or treatment of BV, and no adverse effects have been reported. Therefore, it may be helpful to recommend daily consumption of probiotic products to improve public health among women.
TI  - [Probiotic monotherapy of bacterial vaginosis: a open, randomized trial].
AB  - The aim of the current research is to establish the clinical and microbiological  efficacy of the therapy with local probiotics in the treatment of anaerobic vaginal infections and the therapy's effect upon vaginal flora. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: 381 (100%) women with bacterial vaginitis are included in the research. They were randomized into three groups. In the first group 143 women who were treated with local (10 applications) probiotics vaginal medicine, containing live lactobacillus types Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus. In the second group 126 patients were treated with five days oral administration of Clindamycin (tabl.x 600 mg) BID and local therapy of two vaginal ovules containing each 1000 mg Metronidazole, which were administered intravaginal every other day. In the third group 112 women were treated with the same therapy as the second group and in addition started from the day 5 after it were administered locally probiotic medicine containing Lactobacillus acidophilus u Lactobacillus rhamnosus. The efficacy of the therapeutic scheme was evaluated via comparison of patients' clinical complains in the different groups, of data from clinical examinations (Amsel) and microbiological tests (Nugent) for each patient. RESULTS: Thirty five-forty days after the probiotic therapy, the clinical efficacy in this group (Amsel) is 42.7% and microbiological efficacy (Gram preparation - Nugent)--41.3%. They are lower than the results which we received in the groups where the combine nitroimidazole/incozamide treatment was performed with or without local probiotic. The second group: clinical efficacy--51.6%, microbiological (Nugent)--46.4%. The highest clinical--87.5% and microbiological--80.3% efficacy showed the combine nitroimidazole/lincozamide/probiotic treatment in the third group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the local monotherapy with probiotics has fewer efficacies in comparison to the combine therapeutic schemes for treatment of vaginal disbacteriosis with dominant anaerobic species.
TI  - Influence of fructooligosaccharides on the fermentation profile and viable counts in a symbiotic low fat milk.
AB  - This study evaluated the effects of prebiotics on fermentation profile and growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Bifidobacterium lactis in co-cultures with Streptococcus thermophilus. Acidification rate and viability were positively influenced by the co-culture with B. lactis and by both inulin or oligofructose in low fat milk.
TI  - The influences of fish infusion broth on the biogenic amines formation by lactic  acid bacteria.
AB  - The influences of fish infusion decarboxylase broth (IDB) on biogenic amines (BA) formation by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were investigated. BA productions by single LAB strains were tested in five different fish (anchovy, mackerel, white shark, sardine and gilthead seabream) IDB. The result of the study showed that significant differences in ammonia (AMN) and BA production were observed among the LAB strains in fish IDB (p < 0.05). The highest AMN and TMA production by LAB strains were observed for white shark IDB. The all tested bacteria had decarboxylation activity in fish IDB. The uppermost accumulated amines by LAB strains were tyramine (TYM), dopamine, serotonin and spermidine. The maximum histamine production was observed in sardine (101.69 mg/L) and mackerel (100.84 mg/L) IDB by Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris and Pediococcus acidophilus, respectively. Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and Pediococcus acidophilus had a high TYM producing capability (2943 mg/L and 1157 mg/L) in sardine IDB.
TI  - Probiotics reduce symptoms of antibiotic use in a hospital setting: a randomized  dose response study.
AB  - Probiotics are known to reduce antibiotic associated diarrhea (AAD) and Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) risk in a strain-specific manner. The aim of this study was to determine the dose-response effect of a four strain probiotic combination (HOWARU((R)) Restore) on the incidence of AAD and CDAD and severity of gastrointestinal symptoms in adult in-patients requiring antibiotic therapy. Patients (n=503) were randomized among three study groups: HOWARU((R)) Restore probiotic 1.70x10(10) CFU (high-dose, n=168), HOWARU((R)) Restore probiotic 4.17x10(9) CFU (low-dose, n=168), or placebo (n=167). Subjects were stratified by gender, age, and duration of antibiotic treatment. Study products were administered daily up to 7 days after the final antibiotic dose. The primary endpoint of the study was the incidence of AAD. Secondary endpoints included incidence of CDAD, diarrhea duration, stools per day, bloody stools, fever, abdominal cramping, and bloating. A significant dose-response effect on AAD was observed with incidences of 12.5, 19.6, and 24.6% with high-dose, low-dose, and placebo, respectively (p=0.02). CDAD was the same in both probiotic groups (1.8%) but different from the placebo group (4.8%; p=0.04). Incidences of fever, abdominal pain, and bloating were lower with increasing probiotic dose. The number of daily liquid stools and average duration of diarrhea decreased with higher probiotic dosage. The tested four strain probiotic combination appears to lower the risk of AAD, CDAD, and gastrointestinal symptoms in a dose-dependent manner in adult in-patients.
TI  - Escherichia coli O26 in feedlot cattle: fecal prevalence, isolation, characterization, and effects of an E. coli O157 vaccine and a direct-fed microbial.
AB  - Escherichia coli O26 is second only to O157 in causing foodborne, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) infections. Our objectives were to determine fecal prevalence and characteristics of E. coli O26 in commercial feedlot cattle (17,148) that were enrolled in a study to evaluate an E. coli O157:H7 siderophore receptor and porin (SRP((R))) vaccine (VAC) and a direct-fed microbial (DFM; 10(6) colony-forming units [CFU]/animal/day of Lactobacillus acidophilus and 10(9) CFU/animal/day of Propionibacterium freudenreichii). Cattle were randomly allocated to 40 pens within 10 complete blocks; pens were randomly assigned to control, VAC, DFM, or VAC+DFM treatments. Vaccine was administered on days 0 and 21, and DFM was fed throughout the study. Pen-floor fecal samples (30/pen) were collected weekly for the last 4 study weeks. Samples were enriched in E. coli broth and subjected to a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) designed to detect O26-specific wzx gene and four major virulence genes (stx1, stx2, eae, and ehxA) and to a culture-based procedure that involved immunomagnetic separation and plating on MacConkey agar. Ten presumptive E. coli colonies were randomly picked, pooled, and tested by the multiplex PCR. Pooled colonies positive for O26 serogroup were streaked on sorbose MacConkey agar, and 10 randomly picked colonies per sample were tested individually by the multiplex PCR. The overall prevalence of E. coli O26 was higher (p<0.001) by the culture-based method compared to the PCR assay (22.7 versus 10.5%). The interventions (VAC and or DFM) had no impact on fecal shedding of O26. Serogroup O26 was recovered in pure culture from 23.9% (260 of 1089) of O26 PCR-positive pooled colonies. Only 7 of the 260 isolates were positive for the stx gene and 90.1% of the isolates possessed an eaebeta gene that codes for intimin subtype beta, but not the bfpA gene, which codes for bundle-forming pilus. Therefore, the majority of the O26 recovered from feedlot cattle feces was atypical enteropathogenic E. coli, and not STEC.
TI  - Oral immunization with recombinant Lactobacillus acidophilus expressing the adhesin Hp0410 of Helicobacter pylori induces mucosal and systemic immune responses.
AB  - Helicobacter pylori infection is relatively common worldwide and is closely related to gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, chronic gastritis, and stomach ulcers. Therefore, a safe and effective method for preventing H. pylori infection is urgently needed. Given that developing an effective vaccine against H. pylori is one of the best alternatives, H. pylori adhesin Hp0410 was expressed in the food-grade bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus. The recombinant live bacterial vaccine was then used to orally vaccinate mice, and the immunoprotective effects of Hp0410-producing strains were investigated. H. pylori colonization in the stomach of mice immunized with the recombinant L. acidophilus was significantly reduced, in comparison with that in control groups. Furthermore, mucosal secretory IgA antibodies were elicited in the mucosal tissue of mice immunized with the recombinant bacteria, and specific anti-Hp0410 IgG responses were also detected in mouse serum. There was a significant increase in the level of protection against gastric Helicobacter infection following a challenge with H. pylori Sydney strain 1 (SS1). Our results collectively indicate that adhesin Hp0410 is a promising candidate vaccine antigen, and recombinant L. acidophilus expressing Hp0410 is likely to constitute an effective, low-cost, live bacterial vaccine against H. pylori.
TI  - [Efficacy of combined 5-nitroimidazole and probiotic therapy of bacterial vaginosis: randomized open trial].
AB  - The aim of the current research is to identify the clinical and microbiological effect of 5-nitroimidazol therapy for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis and in combination with probiotics and the influence of such therapy upon vaginal flora. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Women (n = 539) with bacterial vaginosis who meet the criteria were included in the study. They were randomized into two groups with the following therapeutic regimes: in the first group (n = 242 women) the treatment included applications of 2g BID tinidazole for two days and vaginal suppositories of 1000 mg metronidazol at day 1 and 3 (T+M). In the second group (n = 297) the women were cured with the same treatment as those in the first group. In addition to it from the fifth day of the treatment was added a topical administration of vaginal probiotic which contains species of alive lactobacilli: Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus (T+M+P). The efficacy from the therapy was evaluated using the clinical compliances of the women, the data from the clinical examination and the microbiological tests results. RESULTS: The results showed expected increase of clinical therapy efficacy (Amsel - criteria) from 42.8% (T+M; n = 211/242) to 84.06% (T+M+P; n = 274/297) in groups and of microbiological efficacy (Nugent) from 44.7% (T+M; n = 211/242) to 83.3% (T+M+P; n = 274/297), in follow up 35-40 days from the beginning of treatment. The percentage of women with normal vaginal flora on 35-40 day after the therapy increase with 57% in the (T+M) first group while in the second group (T+M+P) with 94%. CONCLUSIONS: Combining the therapies of 5-nitroimidazoles and vaginal probiotic reduce bacterial vaginosis recurrence and restores permanently normal vaginal flora.
TI  - Using phage display selected antibodies to dissect microbiomes for complete de novo genome sequencing of low abundance microbes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Single cell genomics has revolutionized microbial sequencing, but complete coverage of genomes in complex microbiomes is imperfect due to enormous variation in organismal abundance and amplification bias. Empirical methods that complement rapidly improving bioinformatic tools will improve characterization of microbiomes and facilitate better genome coverage for low abundance microbes. METHODS: We describe a new approach to sequencing individual species from microbiomes that combines antibody phage display against intact bacteria with fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). Single chain (scFv) antibodies are selected using phage display against a bacteria or microbial community, resulting in species-specific antibodies that can be used in FACS for relative quantification of an organism in a community, as well as enrichment or depletion prior to genome sequencing. RESULTS: We selected antibodies against Lactobacillus acidophilus and demonstrate a FACS-based approach for identification and enrichment of the organism from both laboratory-cultured and commercially derived bacterial mixtures. The ability to selectively enrich for L. acidophilus when it is present at a very low abundance (<0.2%) leads to complete (>99.8%) de novo genome coverage whereas the standard single-cell sequencing approach is incomplete (<68%). We show that specific antibodies can be selected against L. acidophilus when the monoculture is used as antigen as well as when a community of 10 closely related species is used demonstrating that in principal antibodies can be generated against individual organisms within microbial communities. CONCLUSIONS: The approach presented here demonstrates that phage-selected antibodies against bacteria enable identification, enrichment of rare species, and depletion of abundant organisms making it tractable to virtually any microbe or microbial community. Combining antibody specificity with FACS provides a new approach for characterizing and manipulating microbial communities prior to genome sequencing.
TI  - A study on the prevention of salmonella infection by using the aggregation characteristics of lactic Acid bacteria.
AB  - Salmonella is one of the major pathogenic bacteria that cause food poisoning. This study investigated whether heat-killed as well as live Lactobacillus protects host animal against Salmonella infection. Live and heat-killed Lactobacillusacidophilus was administered orally to Sprague-Dawley rats for 2 weeks before the rats were inoculated with Salmonella. Rise in body temperature was moderate in the group that was treated with heat-killed bacteria as compared to the Salmonella control group. The mean amount of feed intake and water consumption of each rat in the heat-killed bacteria group were nearly normal. The number of fecal Salmonellae was comparable between the live and the heat-killed L. acidophilus groups. This finding shows that L. acidophilus facilitates the excretion of Salmonella. Moreover, the levels of pro inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1 beta, in the heat-killed L. acidophilus group were significantly lower when compared to the levels in the Salmonella control group. These results indicate that nonviable lactic acid bacteria also could play an important role in preventing infections by enteric pathogens such as Salmonella.
TI  - Evaluation of phytate-degrading Lactobacillus culture administration to broiler chickens.
AB  - Probiotics have been demonstrated to promote growth, stimulate immune responses,  and improve food safety of poultry. While widely used, their effectiveness is mixed, and the mechanisms through which they contribute to poultry production are not well understood. Microbial phytases are increasingly supplemented in feed to improve digestibility and reduce antinutritive effects of phytate. The microbial origin of these exogenous enzymes suggests a potentially important mechanism of probiotic functionality. We investigated phytate degradation as a novel probiotic mechanism using recombinant Lactobacillus cultures expressing Bacillus subtilis phytase. B. subtilis phyA was codon optimized for expression in Lactobacillus and cloned into the expression vector pTRK882. The resulting plasmid, pTD003, was transformed into Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus gallinarum, and Lactobacillus gasseri. SDS-PAGE revealed a protein in the culture supernatants of Lactobacillus pTD003 transformants with a molecular weight similar to that of the B. subtilis phytase. Expression of B. subtilis phytase increased phytate degradation of L. acidophilus, L. gasseri, and L. gallinarum approximately 4-, 10-, and 18-fold over the background activity of empty-vector transformants, respectively. Phytase-expressing L. gallinarum and L. gasseri were administered to broiler chicks fed a phosphorus-deficient diet. Phytase-expressing L. gasseri improved weight gain of broiler chickens to a level comparable to that for chickens fed a control diet adequate in phosphorus, demonstrating proof of principle that administration of phytate-degrading probiotic cultures can improve performance of livestock animals. This will inform future studies investigating whether probiotic cultures are able to provide both the performance benefits of feed enzymes and the animal health and food safety benefits traditionally associated with probiotics.
TI  - Probiotic supplementation for respiratory and gastrointestinal illness symptoms in healthy physically active individuals.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: To examine the effect of supplementation with probiotics on respiratory and gastrointestinal illness in healthy active men and women. METHODS: A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial was conducted. Four hundred and sixty five participants (241 males; age 35 +/- 12 y (mean +/- SD) and 224 females; age 36 +/- 12 y) were assigned to one of three groups: Group 1 - Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bl-04 (Bl-04) 2.0 x 10(9)colony forming units per day, CFU per day, Group 2 - Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bi-07 (NCFM & Bi-07) 5 x 10(9) CFU each per day) or Group 3 - placebo mixed in a drink. RESULTS: The risk of an upper respiratory illness episode was significantly lower in the Bl-04 group (hazard ratio 0.73; 95% confidence interval 0.55-0.95; P = 0.022) compared to placebo. There was no significant difference in illness risk between the NCFM & Bi-07 group (hazard ratio 0.81; 0.62-1.08; P = 0.15) and the placebo group. There was a 0.7 and 0.9 month delay in the median time to an illness episode in the Bl-04 and NCFM & Bi-07 groups respectively compared to placebo (placebo 2.5 months; Bl-04 3.2 months; NCFM & Bi-07 3.4 months). There were insufficient GI illness episodes for analysis. The NCFM & Bi-07 group but not the Bl-04 group undertook significantly more physical activity (8.5%; 6.7%-10%; P < 0.003) than the placebo group. CONCLUSION: The probiotic Bl-04 appears to be a useful nutritional supplement in reducing the risk of URTI in healthy physically-active adults.

TI  - Evaluation of probiotic survivability in yogurt exposed to cold chain interruption.
AB  - In this research, the survival of probiotic microorganisms in yogurts stored at room temperature (cold chain interruption conditions) was studied. Milk inoculated with yogurt bacteria (mixed culture of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus) and a single probiotic culture (L. acidophilus LA-5 or Bifidobacterium lactis Bb- 12 or L. rhamnosus HN001 or L. paracasei Lpc-37) were incubated till pH of 4.5 was reached. Probiotic yogurts were stored at two different temperatures including cold (control) and room temperatures (5 and 20 degrees C, respectively). Changes in pH decrease, titratable acidity increase and redox potential increase as well as the viability of probiotics per 6 h intervals during an assumptive interrupted cold storage (24 h) were monitored. The survival of probiotics was strongly dependent on the storage temperature and remarkable viability loss occurred in room temperature compared to refrigerated storage. In addition, the survivability was dependent on probiotic strain. Among our experimental strains, B. lactis Bb-12 showed the less resistance to be stored at 20 degrees C (24 h) and referring to the recommended minimum numbers of 10(7) cfu mL(-) (1), L. rhamnosus HN001 was the most suitable probiotic strain to be used in probiotic yogurts especially in countries having high possibility of cold chain interruption during storage.
TI  - Studying the Stability of S-Layer Protein of Lactobacillus Acidophilus ATCC 4356  in Simulated Gastrointestinal Fluids Using SDS-PAGE and Circular Dichroism.
AB  - Crystalline arrays of proteinaceous subunits forming surface layers (S-layers) are now recognized as one of the most common outermost cell envelope components of prokaryotic organisms. The surface layer protein of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC4356 is composed of a single species of protein of apparent molecular weight of 43-46 KDa. Considering the Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC4356 having the S-layer is stable in harsh gastrointestinal (GI) conditions, a protective role against destructive GI factors which has been proposed for these nanostructures. It opens interesting perspectives in the using and development of this S-layer as a protective coat for oral administration of unstable drug nanocarriers. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to study the in-vitro stability of the S-layers in the simulated gastrointestinal fluids (SGIF). This study was planned to evaluate the in-vitro stability of the extracted S-layer protein of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC4356 in SGIF using it as a protective coat in oral drug delivery. Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy were used to study the stability of the S-layer protein incubated in SGIF. Both the SDS-PAGE and CD spectra results showed that Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC4356 S-layer protein is stable in simulated gastric fluid (SGF) with pH = 2 up to 5 min. It is stable in SGF pH = 3.2 and above it, with and without pepsin. It is also stable in all the simulated intestinal fluids. This S-layer is also stable in all of the simulated intestinal fluids.
TI  - Interaction of Aeromonas strains with lactic acid bacteria via Caco-2 cells.
AB  - The genus Aeromonas includes some species that have now been identified as human  pathogens of significant medical importance. We investigated the ability of 13 selected Aeromonas strains belonging to nine species isolated from clinical cases (n = 5), environmental waters (n = 5), and fish (n = 3) to adhere to and translocate Caco-2 cells in the absence and presence of two lactic acid bacteria (LAB), i.e., Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium breve. Aeromonas isolates were also assessed for their cytotoxicity, the presence of virulence genes, and hemolysin production. Among the clinical isolates, one strain of Aeromonas veronii biovar veronii and two strains of Aeromonas hydrophila carried cytotoxin (act), heat-labile toxin (alt), hemolysin (hlyA), and aerolysin (aerA) genes, were cytotoxic to Vero cells, produced hemolysin, and showed higher adherence to Caco-2 cells. In contrast, this was seen in only one environmental strain, a strain of A. veronii biovar sobria. When Aeromonas strains were coinoculated with LAB onto Caco-2 cells, their level of adhesion was reduced. However, their rate of translocation in the presence of LAB increased and was significantly (P < 0.05) higher among fish strains. We suggest that either the interaction between Aeromonas and LAB strains could have a detrimental effect on the Caco-2 cells, allowing the Aeromonas to translocate more readily, or the presence of the LAB stimulated the Aeromonas strains to produce more toxins and/or increase their translocation rate.
TI  - In vitro fermentation of prebiotic oligosaccharides by Bifidobacterium lactis HN019 and Lactobacillus spp.
AB  - The utilisation of various prebiotic oligosaccharides by probiotic strains of Bifidobacterium lactis, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus acidophilus was investigated in order to determine the synbiotic potential of various prebiotic/probiotic combinations. Analysis by HPLC and high-performance anion-exchange chromatography of the cell-free medium taken during growth of the three probiotic bacteria showed differences in the consumption of the various oligosaccharides. Analysis of galactooligosaccharides showed that both L. rhamnosus and B. lactis consumed mostly mono- and di-saccharide, while L. acidophilus consumed oligosaccharides up to trisaccharide. Both B. lactis and L. acidophilus utilised fructooligosaccharides and inulin, but showed different patterns of oligosaccharide consumption. Only L. rhamnosus grew on beta-glucan oligosaccharides and preferentially consumed the trisaccharide. The results indicate the synbiotic potential of the various probiotic/prebiotic combinations, particularly L. acidophilus/galactooligosaccharides, L. acidophilus/fructooligosaccharides or inulin and L. rhamnosus/beta-glucan oligosaccharides.
TI  - Probiotics: a comprehensive approach toward health foods.
AB  - Food products containing probiotics and prebiotics are an important development in Health foods, which enhance health promoting microbial flora in the intestine. Probiotic refers to viable microorganism that promotes or support a beneficial balance of the autochthonous microbial population of the gastrointestinal tract. A number of genera of bacteria (and yeast) are used as probiotics, including Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, and Enterococcus, but the main species believed to have probiotic characteristics are Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium spp., and L. casei. Probiotics can reduce diarrheal incidence, lactose intolerance, lower serum cholesterol, stimulate the immune system, control infections, act as antibiotics, suppress tumors, and protect against colon or bladder cancer by maintaining a healthy intestinal microflora balance. Lactic acid bacteria produce biopreservatives such as lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and bacteriocins that are used to retard both spoilage and the growth of pathogenic bacteria. Food, particularly dairy products are considered as an ideal vehicle for delivering probiotic bacteria to the human gastrointestinal tract. Cereals being rich source of prebiotics such as beta-glucan and arabinoxylan, galacto-, and fructooligosaccharides are considered for development of probiotic foods. Good manufacturing practices must be applied in the manufacture of probiotic foods with quality assurance, and shelf-life conditions established.
TI  - Effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum supplementation to standard triple therapy on Helicobacter pylori eradication and dynamic changes in intestinal flora.
AB  - To investigate Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) and Bifidobacterium bifidum (B. bifidum) supplementation to triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication and dynamic changes in intestinal flora in children with H. pylori infection. One hundred H. pylori-infected children were randomly assigned to two groups: treatment group (n = 43), standard triple anti-H. pylori therapy plus probiotics of L. acidophilus and B. bifidum for 2 weeks followed by taking probiotics for another 4 weeks; control group (n = 45), standard triple anti-H. pylori therapy for 6 weeks. After 6-week treatment, (1)(3)C-urease breath test was performed and side effects were monitored during the observation period. Quantitative PCR with 16S rRNA-gene-targeted species-specific primers was carried out for the analysis of human intestinal B. bifidum, L. acidophilus, and Escherichia coli (E. coli). As expected, treatment group could significantly enhance the H. pylori eradication rate (83.7 vs. 64.4 %, P < 0.05). B. bifidum, L. acidophilus, and E. coli showed no statistical difference before or after therapy in the treatment group. The number of B. bifidum and L. acidophilus was significantly decreased after 2-week treatment in the control group, but after 6-week treatment it significantly increased and nearly returned to the level before treatment. The number of E. coli increased significantly after 2-week treatment, while after 6-week treatment, it nearly decreased to the level before treatment. L. acidophilus and B. bifidum supplementation is effective for H. pylori eradication compared with triple therapy alone.
TI  - Role of Lactobacillus in the prevention of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) is a major public health problem because of significant morbidity and mortality, and many clinicians pay attention to Lactobacillus as a potentially effective treatment. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of Lactobacillus in the prevention of CDAD. METHODS: The databases MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, metaRegister of Controlled Trials, National Institutes of Health, CNKI, VIP, and Wanfang data were searched to locate all reported randomized controlled trials (RCT) from 1990 to December 2012. Only RCT in English and Chinese using Lactobacillus for the prevention of documented CDAD were considered for study inclusion. The data was analyzed by Review Manager and SPSS software. RESULTS: Seven placebo-controlled RCTs that evaluated the prevention of CDAD, which included 1486 subjects, accorded with inclusion and exclusion criteria. The mean age of the subjects ranged from 4.15 to 64.75 years and the proportion of male subjects ranged from 42.0% to 59.1%. The total daily dose of Lactobacillus ranged from 1.2x10(9)-1.2x10(12) colonyforming units (CFU). A low risk of bias was attributed to two studies and four studies evaluated a medium-level risk of bias. The combined risk ratio (RR) of developing CDAD was significantly lower in subjects who received Lactobacillus compared with subjects who received placebo (RR 0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22-0.67). A combination regimen of Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) and Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01-0.36) showed significant effect sizes for the prevention of CDAD, while single regimens of Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) and Lactobacillus rhamnosus (L. rhamnosus) did not. Across all trials, positive significant effects of Lactobacillus were observed in the elderly subgroup (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01-0.36). Whether the 1x10(12)-9x10(12) CFU/d Lactobacillus could prevent CDAD significantly or not was unclear. CONCLUSION: There is a sufficient evidence to recommend Lactobacillus (L. acidophilus and L. casei) as a prevention therapy for CDAD.
TI  - The influence of growth conditions on strain differentiation within the Lactobacillus acidophilus group using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry profiling.
AB  - RATIONALE: Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) profiling of bacteria is often used to distinguish isolates beyond the species level, even to the level of individual strains. However, the influence of bacterial growth conditions on the discriminatory power of the method to the strain level has not yet been properly evaluated. METHODS: For the purpose of this study, we used an extraction protocol recommended for clinical laboratories for MALDI-TOF MS profiling of bacteria. Seventeen closely related strains of the Lactobacillus acidophilus group were cultivated under various growth conditions (growth medium, time, and temperature) and analyzed. RESULTS: Out of a total of 327 samples, 80 % were correctly assigned to the species level and 13 % only to the genus level. When using data obtained from strains cultured for lengthy periods (7 days), the identification success rate was reduced due to poor signal quality, whereas with shorter cultivation times there was no influence of growth conditions on the assignment of particular strains to their corresponding species. However, variations in certain cultivation parameters were found to influence identification and differentiation of most of the examined strains. Strain discrimination was frequently found to be dependent on the selection of culture conditions. MALDI-TOF MS data treatment (strain-specific peak detection, BioTyper scoring, subtyping, or cluster analysis) also contributed to the discriminatory power of the method. CONCLUSIONS: When MALDI-TOF MS profiling of bacteria is used for strain discrimination, the cultivation conditions should be properly optimized and controlled as they significantly contribute to the discriminatory power of the method.
TI  - Can Lactobacillus acidophilus improve minimal hepatic encephalopathy? A neurometabolite study using magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) is diagnosed when hepatic patients perform worse on psychometric tests compared to healthy controls. This study aimed to evaluate probiotics as alternative therapy in MHE. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is an open-label randomised controlled trial, performed in the Department of Tropical Medicine and Infectious Diseases, Tanta University Hospitals, from March 2010 to January 2012. A total of 90 patients with MHE were allocated by simple randomisation to three parallel equal groups. Group A received lactulose, group B a probiotic (Lactobacillus acidophilus) and group C served as the control. After informed consent, patients were tested for gut micrecology, fasting blood ammonia, liver functions and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) examination to study brain metabolites, mainly choline (Cho), myo-inositol (mI), glutamine+glutamate (Glx) and creatinin (Cre). Patients who developed overt encephalopathy were excluded from analysis. The whole battery of investigations was repeated in the same order after 4weeks. RESULTS: The probiotic was better tolerated than lactulose. The relative risk reduction (RRR) of developing overt encephalopathy was 60% in the case of lactulose and 80% in the case of probiotic, with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 2.4 and 2.3, respectively. The differential but not total microecology count was significantly shifted towards saccharolytic rather than proteolytic bacteria. The mI/Cre and (Cho+mI)/Glx ratios were significantly increased and the Glx/Cre ratio was significantly reduced after 1month-follow-up in the probiotic group compared to the lactulose group and in both treatment groups compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: Both probiotic and lactulose therapy can improve blood ammonia and psychometric tests in MHE and reduce the risk of developing overt encephalopathy. MRS showed more improvement in the levels of brain neurometabolites in the probiotic group.
TI  - Effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus and inulin on faecal viral shedding and immunization against H9 N2 Avian influenza virus.
AB  - AIMS: The aims of this investigation were to compare the effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus addition as simple or microencapsulated (ME) probiotic and inulin as prebiotic to the broiler diet on the faecal viral shedding and immunization against avian influenza virus (AIV) with or without H9 N2 vaccination. METHODS AND RESULTS: Simple or ME forms of Lact. acidophilus, inulin and combination of them as synbiotic were analysed for their ability to enhance immunity against H9 N2 AIV and to decrease faecal viral shedding in Cobb-500 broiler chicks. Our results indicated that probiotic as ME form can decrease haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titre significantly on days 34 in vaccinated trial (P < 0.05). Also, the effects of ME form of probiotic are more remarkable on reduction of viral faecal shedding detected by RT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows the significant role of microencapsulation on probiotic effects against H9 N2 AIV. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The application of probiotics especially in the ME form could have the potential for stimulating the immune system, preventing influenza infection and consequently reduce faecal viral shedding of H9 N2 AIV.
TI  - A randomized double-blind controlled trial: impact of probiotics on diarrhea in patients treated with pelvic radiation.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Radical radiation therapy is commonly used for treatment of pelvic cancer. Up to 80% of patients receiving radiotherapy will develop acute radiation induced diarrhea. The primary aim of this randomized double blind controlled trial is to evaluate the effect of the probiotic Bifilact((R)) on moderate and severe treatment-induced diarrhea during pelvic radiation. METHODS: Patients with pelvic cancers were treated between 2006 and 2010 at L'Hotel-Dieu de Quebec, University Health Center. Some patients had surgery before pelvic radiotherapy and some received chemotherapy. A total of 246 Patients were randomized between a placebo and either of two regiments of double strain Bifilact((R)) probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus LAC-361 and Bifidobacterium longum BB-536): a standard dose twice a day (1.3 billion CFU) or a high dose three times a day (10 billion CFU). Patients were trained to record their digestive symptoms daily with a standardized scale and they met a registered dietician and radiation oncologist every week during treatment. The main analysis compared time to first appearance of grade >/=2-3-4 diarrhea using Kaplan-Meier curves as measured by proportion of patients without moderate and severe diarrhea. RESULTS: 229 patients were analyzed. The difference between the groups for overall grade 2-3-4 diarrhea was not statistically significant (p = 0.13). However at 60 days, the proportion of patients without moderate and severe diarrhea in the standard dose group (35%) was more than twice as high as that of the placebo group (17%) with a hazard ratio of 0.69 (p = 0.04). In patients who had surgery, the standard probiotics dose group had a better proportion of patients without very severe diarrhea than the placebo group, respectively 97% and 74% (p = 0.03). In all groups, the average number of bowel movements per day during treatment was less than 3 soft stools (p = 0.80) and the median abdominal pain less than 1 based on the National Cancer Institute scale (p = 0.23). CONCLUSION: Standard dose of Bifilact((R)) may reduce radiation induced grade 2-3-4 diarrhea at the end of the treatment of patients with pelvic cancer. In patients operated on before RT, a standard dose of probiotics may reduce radiation induced grade 4 diarrhea. Nutritional interventions by a registered dietician seemed to reduce global digestive symptoms. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov. Identifier NCT01839721.
TI  - Adhesion forces and composition of planktonic and adhering oral microbiomes.
AB  - The oral microbiome consists of a planktonic microbiome residing in saliva and an adhering microbiome (the biofilm adhering to oral hard and soft tissues). Here we hypothesized that possible differences in microbial composition of the planktonic and adhering oral microbiome on teeth can be related to the forces by which different bacterial species are attracted to the tooth surface. The relative presence of 7 oral bacterial species in saliva and biofilm collected from 10 healthy human volunteers was determined twice in each volunteer by denaturing-gradient-gel electrophoresis. Analysis of both microbiomes showed complete separation of the planktonic from the adhering oral microbiome. Next, adhesion forces of corresponding bacterial strains with saliva-coated enamel surfaces were measured by atomic force microscopy. Species that were found predominantly in the adhering microbiome had significantly higher adhesion forces to saliva-coated enamel (-0.60 to -1.05 nN) than did species mostly present in the planktonic microbiome (-0.40 to -0.55 nN). It is concluded that differences in composition of the planktonic and the adhering oral microbiome are due to small differences in the forces by which strains adhere to saliva-coated enamel, providing an important step in understanding site- and material-specific differences in the composition of biofilms in the oral cavity.
TI  - Bacterial counts from five over-the-counter probiotics: are you getting what you  paid for?
AB  - There is concern that the bacterial colony counts present at the time of manufacture and listed on the probiotic package may not be reflective of the numbers viable colonies at the time of purchase and patient consumption thereby diminishing efficacy. We performed a colony count study of three separate samples of five different probiotics purchased from three different stores: Bifidobacterium infantis (Align((R))); Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285((R)) and Lactobacillus casei LBC80R((R)) (Bio-K+((R))); Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (Culturelle((R))); Saccharomyces boulardii (Florastor((R))) and "L. acidophilus" and "Lactobacillus helveticus" (Lactinex((R))). Approximately 1 g of powder of each (Lactinex((R)) tablets were crushed before testing) was reconstituted in sterile distilled water, serial 10-fold dilutions were prepared and plated in duplicate onto blood agar plates, with incubation for 48 h in an anaerobic chamber (except the Saccharomyces which was incubated aerobically) after which colony counts were performed. The Florastor((R)) packaging did not state an expected concentration and was found to have 9.2 x 10(9)-1.3 x 10(10) CFU/g. Lactinex((R)), Align((R)), Bio-K+((R)), and Culturelle((R)) had viable colony counts that were similar to those stated on the package.
TI  - [Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of probiotic bacterial strains used in medicinal products].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The optimization of quality testing strategy of products containing probiotics might allow to general improvement of its safer use in humans. The goal of the study was the evaluation of quality expressed by identity, colony forming unit (CFU) and antibiotic sensitivity ofprobiotics used in medicinal products available in Poland using the appropriate and validated procedures. METHODS: The medicinal products containing L. rhamnosus, L. acidophilus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and B. animalis subsp. lactis, L. helveticus, and L. gasseri were tested for species identity performed with validated rep-PCR (BOXA 1R) method. The antimicrobial susceptibility of working seeds and strains isolated to 26 antibiotics were tested by disk diffusion and E-test methods using relevant references as recommended by EUCAST. The numbers of probiotic strains, expressed as cfu count per package, was done using plating plunge method. RESULTS: All strains tested, except B. lactis, were found to be resistant to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, nalidixic acid, metronidazole, and colistin. B. lactis was resistant to aminoglycosides. L. rhamnosus strains were found to be resistant to vancomycin, (MIC > 256 microg/ml) similarly to ATCC strains (L. rhamnosus GG 53103 and 244). The sensitivity to other antibiotics was strain specific. The rep-PCR method was found species and strain specific. All products tested fulfilled declared countent as measured by cfu count/package. CONCLUSIONS: Quality of medicinal products containing probiotics was found undoubted and confirmed. The optimized strategy of quality monitoring of probiotics used in medicinal products can be used in dietary supplements and foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses.
TI  - Meta-analysis shows limited evidence for using Lactobacillus acidophilus LB to treat acute gastroenteritis in children.
AB  - A meta-analysis of four randomised controlled trials of varying methodological quality, involving 304 children aged 1-48 months, showed that Lactobacillus acidophilus LB (LB) reduced the duration of diarrhoea in hospitalised, but not outpatient, children compared with a placebo. The chance of a cure on day three was similar in both groups, but LB increased the chance of cure on day four. CONCLUSION: There is limited evidence to recommend LB for treating paediatric diarrhoea.
TI  - Antagonistic activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus LA10 against Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis SE86 in mice.
AB  - Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis is one of the main pathogens responsible  for foodborne illness in Brazil. Probiotic bacteria can play a role in defense and recovery from enteropathogenic infections. In this study, the ability of Lactobacillus acidophilus LA10 to colonise and exert antagonistic effects in the gastrointestinal tract was tested before and during experimental infection in conventional mice contaminated with S. Enteritidis (SE86). A dose of 0.1 mL containing 10(8) viable cells of SE86 and L. acidophilus LA10 was orally administered by gavage to mice. The experiment was divided into groups. As a negative control, Group 1 was administered only sterile saline solution. As a positive control, Group 2 was administered only SE86. Group 3 was first administered SE86, and after 10 days, treated with L. acidophilus LA10. Group 4 was first administered L. acidophilus LA10, and after 10 days, challenged with SE86. The results demonstrated that a significant number of SE86 cells were able to colonize the gastrointestinal tract of mice, specifically in the colon and ileum. L. acidophilus LA10 demonstrated an antagonistic effect against SE86, with better results observed for Group 3 over Group 4. Thus, L. acidophilus LA10 shows potential antagonistic effects against S. Enteritidis SE86, especially if administered after infection.
TI  - Anti cariogenic efficacy of herbal and conventional tooth pastes - a comparative  in-vitro study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: An upsurge of herbal products in various catalogues of fast moving consumer goods is evident. Dental creams or pastes which have numerous brands since years, have addition of many more herbal tooth pastes. Main claim of these herbal tooth pastes being effective reduction in cavities and plaque control. Proven fact is that proper brushing with a tooth brush and tooth paste brings down the caries incidence, and there is a substantial amount of contribution made by indispensable ingredient i.e, tooth pastes and their antibacterial component. AIM: To evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of various herbal tooth pastes available in the market and compare it with a conventional tooth paste with known antibacterial effect. MATERIALS & METHODS: The antibacterial efficacy of five herbal tooth pastes and two conventional tooth pastes with different ingredients was evaluated by the zone of inhibition created around the disc on the culture plates against streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus acidophilus. RESULTS: The herbal tooth pastes showed similar efficacy as that of the conventional tooth pastes. One herbal tooth paste with multiple herbal ingredients had greater zone of inhibition compared to the conventional tooth pastes and other herbal tooth pastes. CONCLUSION: Herbal tooth pastes have similar antibacterial effect as conventional tooth pastes. Tooth paste with multiple herbal ingredients is more efficient than the tooth pastes with fewer herbal ingredients in an anticariogenic property. Key words: Anti-carcinogenicity, Herbal tooth pastes, Plaque Control. How to cite this article: Mohan Kumar K P, Priya N K, Madhushankari G S.

TI  - The life history of Lactobacillus acidophilus as a probiotic: a tale of revisionary taxonomy, misidentification and commercial success.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus is a commercially significant bacterial probiotic, originally isolated from the human gastrointestinal tract and designated Bacillus acidophilus in 1900. Throughout the development of methods to identify and characterise bacteria, L. acidophilus has undergone multiple taxonomic revisions and is now the type species of a phylogenetic subgroup in the highly diverse and heterogeneous Lactobacillus genus. As a result of the limitations of differentiating phenotypically similar species by morphological and biochemical means and revisionary nature of Lactobacillus taxonomy, the characterisation of L. acidophilus has struggled with misidentification and misrepresentation. In contrast, due to its global use as a probiotic supplement in functional foods, L. acidophilus sensu stricto is now one of the most well-characterised Lactobacillus species. Here, we establish the provenance of L. acidophilus strains, unpicking historical and current misidentifications of L. acidophilus, and reviewing the probiotic, genomic and physiological characteristics of this important Lactobacillus species.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus alleviates platelet-activating factor-induced inflammatory responses in human intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  - Probiotics have been used as alternative prevention and therapy modalities in intestinal inflammatory disorders including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Pathophysiology of IBD and NEC includes the production of diverse lipid mediators, including platelet-activating factor (PAF) that mediate inflammatory responses in the disease. PAF is known to activate NF-kappaB, however, the mechanisms of PAF-induced inflammation are not fully defined. We have recently described a novel PAF-triggered pathway of NF-kappaB activation and IL-8 production in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), requiring the pivotal role of the adaptor protein Bcl10 and its interactions with CARMA3 and MALT1. The current studies examined the potential role of the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus in reversing the PAF-induced, Bcl10-dependent NF-kappaB activation and IL-8 production in IECs. PAF treatment (5 microMx24 h) of NCM460 and Caco-2 cells significantly increased nuclear p65 NF-kappaB levels and IL-8 secretion (2-3-fold, P<0.05), compared to control, which were blocked by pretreatment of the cells for 6 h with L. acidophilus (LA) or its culture supernatant (CS), followed by continued treatments with PAF for 24 h. LA-CS also attenuated PAF-induced increase in Bcl10 mRNA and protein levels and Bcl10 promoter activity. LA-CS did not alter PAF-induced interaction of Bcl10 with CARMA3, but attenuated Bcl10 interaction with MALT1 and also PAF-induced ubiquitination of IKKgamma. Efficacy of bacteria-free CS of LA in counteracting PAF-induced inflammatory cascade suggests that soluble factor(s) in the CS of LA mediate these effects. These results define a novel mechanism by which probiotics counteract PAF-induced inflammation in IECs.
TI  - Dual functions of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM as protection against rotavirus  diarrhea.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to examine the dose effects of Lactobacillus  acidophilus (LA) NCFM strain on rotavirus-specific antibody and B-cell responses in gnotobiotic pigs vaccinated with an oral attenuated human rotavirus (AttHRV). METHODS: Pigs were inoculated with AttHRV vaccine in conjunction with high-dose LA (14 doses, total 2.2 x 10(6) colony-forming units [CFU]), intermediate-dose LA (MidLA) (9 doses, total 3.2 x 10(9) CFU), low-dose LA (LoLA) (5 doses, total 2.1 x 10(6) CFU), or without LA feeding. Protection against rotavirus shedding and diarrhea was assessed upon challenge with a virulent HRV. Rotavirus-specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG antibodies in serum and rotavirus-specific IgA and IgG antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) and memory B cells in ileum, spleen, and blood of the pigs were measured and compared among treatment groups. RESULTS: The MidLA, but not high-dose LA or LoLA, significantly reduced rotavirus diarrhea (MidLA-only group) and significantly improved the protection conferred by AttHRV vaccine (MidLA + AttHRV group). Associated with the increased protection, MidLA significantly enhanced rotavirus-specific antibody, ASCs, and memory B-cell responses to AttHRV vaccine. High-dose LA or LoLA did not enhance virus-specific antibody and ASC responses, and hence did not improve the vaccine efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the importance of dose selection and indicate that certain specific lactobacilli strains at the appropriate dose have the dual function of reducing rotavirus diarrhea and enhancing the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of rotavirus vaccines.

AB  - AIMS: Evaluation of an effect of glycation of Ara h 1 on proliferation and survival rate and adhesion of intestinal Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus acidophilus. METHODS AND RESULTS: Pure Ara h 1 heated at three different temperature conditions (G37, G60 and C145 degrees C) in the presence or absence of glucose was subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis. Impacts of Ara h 1 hydrolysates on the bacterial proliferation, survival rate and adhesion to Caco-2 cells in mono and heterogeneous cultures were studied with fluorescent techniques: DAPI, LIVE/DEAD staining and FISH. Examined hydrolysates hindered proliferation of E. coli and Ent. faecalis with simultaneous decrease in their survival. Maillard reaction (MR, glycation) of Ara h 1 did not alter the effect of hydrolysates on bacterial proliferation rate. Hydrolysates modified at 60 and 145 degrees C with glucose altered the profile of immobilized bacteria, mostly by lowering the number of adhering E. coli and promoting the adhesion of bacteria from genera Lactobacillus and Enterococcus. CONCLUSIONS: Ara h1 hydrolysates processed in various ways demonstrated their strong modulatory effect on bacterial proliferation, survival rate and adhesion. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Reducing the adhesion of opportunistic bacteria by hydrolysates of Ara h 1 glycated at 60 and 145 degrees C, together with modulation of immobilization of beneficial lactobacilli and enterococci, may be of relevance in terms of the physiological status of the intestinal barrier.
TI  - Cell-free preparations of Lactobacillus acidophilus strain La-5 and Bifidobacterium longum strain NCC2705 affect virulence gene expression in Campylobacter jejuni.
AB  - Campylobacter spp. are among the most commonly reported bacterial causes of acute diarrheal disease in humans worldwide. Potential virulence factors include motility, chemotaxis, colonization ability, adhesion to intestinal cells, invasion and epithelial translocation, intracellular survival, and formation of toxins. Probiotic Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains are known to have an inhibitory effect against the growth of various foodborne pathogens. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus strain La-5 and Bifidobacterium longum strain NCC2705 cell-free spent media (CFSM) on the expression of virulence genes (cadF, cdtB, flaA, and ciaB) of Campylobacter jejuni strain 81-176 and a luxS mutant, using real-time PCR. Our results demonstrated that the CFSM of both probiotic strains were able to down-regulate the expression of ciaB (ratio of -2.80 and -5.51, respectively) and flaA (ratio of -7.00 and -5.13, respectively) in the wild-type Campylobacter strain. In the luxS mutant, where the activated methyl cycle is disrupted, only the ciaB gene (ratio -7.21) was repressed in the presence of La-5 CFSM. A supplementation of homocysteine to restore the disrupted cycle was able to partially reestablish the probiotic effect of both strains. luxS and the activated methyl cycle might play an active role in the modulation of virulence of C. jejuni by probiotic extracts.
TI  - Effect of a sublethal high-pressure homogenization treatment on the fatty acid membrane composition of probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  - High-pressure homogenization (HPH) has been proposed to be applied directly to lactic acid bacterial cells at sublethal levels to enhance some functional properties. As the principal target of HPH are the cell surface envelope structures, the aim of this work was to study the effect of a HPH treatment, applied at 50 MPa, on cell membrane stress responses of already-known functional strains, isolated from Argentinean products. Specifically, the membrane fatty acid composition of cells before and after the sublethal treatment was investigated, and the results showed that plasma membranes, their level of unsaturation and their composition are involved in response mechanisms adopted by microbial cells when subjected to a sublethal HPH stress. In fact, the data obtained demonstrated that the treatment was able to modify the fatty acid profile of the different strains, although a uniform response was not observed. Further studies are necessary both to elucidate the role of each fatty acid in the cell response mechanisms and to clarify the changes in membrane compositions induced by HPH treatment also in relation to the applicative potential of this technique. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study contributed to understand the response mechanisms activated in cells exposed to pressure stress. It has been demonstrated that high-pressure homogenization (HPH) treatments, conducted at sublethal levels, could increase some important functional and technological characteristics of nonintestinal probiotic strains. The findings of this paper can contribute to elucidate the mechanisms through which these treatments can modify these strain probiotic properties that are related to outermost cell structures, also principal target of HPH.
TI  - Probiotics determine hypolipidemic and antioxidant effects in hyperlipidemic hamsters.
AB  - SCOPE: Hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, and the oxidative stress are among the known risk factors of atherosclerosis. Our aim was to assess the hypolipidemic and antioxidant effects of a probiotic mix (Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium animalis) in hyperlipidemic hamsters (HL). METHODS AND RESULTS: Male Golden Syrian hamsters developed hyperlipidemia after 21 weeks of fat diet. For the last 5 weeks of experiment, ten HL were treated with the probiotic mix (HLP), ten received water (HL). Ten animals received standard chow (N). Increase of plasma total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), phospholipids (PL), oxidized LDL, glucose, of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) in plasma, liver, and myocardium, and of intestinal Niemann Pick C1 like 1 (NPC1L1) and microsomal TG transfer protein (MTTP) expression was observed in HL versus N. The probiotic mix decreased plasma TC, TG, PL, oxidized LDL, 4-HNE, and glucose levels and increased paraoxonase-1 activity, decreased NPC1L1 and MTTP protein expression compared to HL. In HLP liver, a significant reduction of TC, TG, and fatty acids was observed. PL increased and 4-HNE levels decreased in the liver and myocardium of HLP versus HL. CONCLUSION: Our data support the administration of probiotics to humans because of their hypolipidemic (through decreasing intestinal NPC1L1 and MTTP) and antioxidant effects (stimulating HDL-associated paraoxonase-1).
TI  - Lactobacillus apis sp. nov., from the stomach of honeybees (Apis mellifera), having an in vitro inhibitory effect on the causative agents of American and European foulbrood.
AB  - A taxonomic study was performed on Gram-stain-positive, catalase-negative and regular rod-shaped bacterial strains R4B(T) and R4C, isolated from the stomachs of honeybees. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that the phylogenetic position of the novel strains was within the genus Lactobacillus; the highest sequence similarity to R4B(T) was shown by Lactobacillus acidophilus BCRC 10695(T) (93.6 %). Lower sequence similarities were found to other obligately homofermentative lactobacilli. A PCR-DGGE method could detect the sequence of the 16S rRNA gene of strain R4B(T) at different developmental stages of honeybees occurring in two different locations in the Czech Republic. The distinctiveness of the strains from other lactobacilli was also confirmed by analysis of sequences of other phylogenetic markers applicable to the taxonomy of the genus Lactobacillus, ribotyping and rep-PCR analysis. The DNA G+C content of strain R4B(T) was 41.3 mol%. The predominant cellular fatty acids of strain R4B(T) were C18 : 1omega9c, summed C19 : 1omega6c/C19 : 0 cyclo omega10c, C16 : 0, summed C18 : 1omega7c/C18 : 1omega6c and summed C16 : 1omega7c/C16 : 1omega6c. The major polar lipids of strain R4B(T) were glycolipids, lipids and phospholipids. Phenotypic and phylogenetic characteristics also confirmed the independent status of the strains at the species level. Interestingly, strain R4B(T) was able to inhibit growth in vitro of Paenibacillus larvae subsp. larvae (causal agent of American foulbrood in honeybees) and Melissococcus plutonius (causal agent of European foulbrood). The name Lactobacillus apis sp. nov. is proposed for this novel taxon; the type strain is R4B(T) ( = CCM 8403(T) = LMG 26964(T)).
TI  - Antipathogenic activity of probiotics against Salmonella Typhimurium and Clostridium difficile in anaerobic batch culture systems: is it due to synergies in probiotic mixtures or the specificity of single strains?
AB  - Probiotics are currently being investigated for prevention of infections caused by enteric pathogens. The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the influence of three single probiotics: Lactobacillus casei NCIMB 30185 (PXN 37), Lactobacillus acidophilus NCIMB 30184 (PXN 35), Bifidobacterium breve NCIMB 30180 (PXN 25) and a probiotic mixture containing the above strains plus twelve other strains belonging to the Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Lactococcus, Streptococcus and Bacillus genera on the survival of Salmonella Typhimurium and Clostridium difficile using pH-controlled anaerobic batch cultures containing mixed faecal bacteria. Changes in relevant bacterial groups and effects of probiotic addition on survival of the two pathogens were assessed over 24 h. Quantitative analysis of bacterial populations revealed that there was a significant increase in lactobacilli and/or bifidobacteria numbers, depending on probiotic addition, compared with the control (no added probiotic). There was also a significant reduction in S. Typhimurium and C. difficile numbers in the presence of certain probiotics compared with controls. Of the probiotic treatments, two single strains namely L. casei NCIMB 30185 (PXN 37), and B. breve NCIMB 30180 (PXN 25) were the most potent in reducing the numbers of S. Typhimurium and C. difficile. In addition, the supplementation with probiotics into the systems influenced some fermentations parameters. Acetate was found in the largest concentrations in all vessels and lactate and formate were generally detected in higher amounts in vessels with probiotic addition compared to controls.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of the antibacterial effects of four dentine bonding systems: An in vitro study.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate and the compare antibacterial efficacy of four dentin bonding system against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius and Lactobacillus acidophilus over a period of three months using agar disk diffusion test. METHODOLOGY: All the three standard bacterial strains were inoculated into BHI broth and incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 hours. A 100 mul of broth suspension containing aliquots of S. mutans, S. salivarius and L. acidophilus were spread onto M-H agar medium using sterile cotton swabs. The experimental groups were as follows: GROUP A: Test conducted for evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy against S. mutans MTCC 497, GROUP B: Test conducted for evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy against S. salivarius MTCC 1938, and GROUP C: Test conducted for evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy against L. acidophilus MTCC 447. For sample preparation, 20 mul bonding agent was dropped with micropipettes on paper disks, and blown dry for 10 seconds. Then it was light-cured at 2 mm for 20 sec using a QTH visible light curing unit. For first reading, the sample disks were placed over the freshly inoculated agar plates and then incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 hours. The rest of the paper disks were stored in dark, submerged in distilled water at 37 degrees C. They were placed on freshly inoculated spread plates after specific time intervals- 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months after ageing in PBS. After incubation, the diameters of zones of inhibition around the plates were measured. The experiment was performed twice in triplicate. The data was then statistically analysed using Two way ANOVA test and post hoc. RESULTS: Results showed that Xeno III had the maximum antibacterial efficacy over a period of three months, followed by XP bond. This antibacterial activity was maximum against Streptococcus mutans, followed by Lactobacillus acidophilus and least against Streptococcus salivarius. Adper Easy One and G bond had minimal effect against the test bacteria during the test period. CONCLUSION: The antibacterial effect decreased over a period of three months for all the dentin bonding systems.
TI  - In situ control of food spoilage fungus using Lactobacillus acidophilus NCDC 291.
AB  - A challenge for food industry today is to produce minimally processed food, without use of chemical preservatives and little compromise on nutritional status. Lactobacillus acidophilus NCDC 291 can be directly added to food where it enhances shelf life by competing with other microflora (both bacterial and fungal) for food and also by production of antimicrobial metabolites as bacteriocins. Comprehensive studies have demonstrated the in vitro activity of bacteriocins. However their role in preventing fresh food spoilage needs more elucidation. The present study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the whole cells of this organism as biopreservative agent against fungi. Four most commonly occurring spoilage fungi were isolated and were identified as Fusarium, Alternaria, Penicillium and Aspergillus. Growth of all of them was inhibited in in vitro studies, (approximately 33-43% decrease in mycelial dry weight basis between test and control). In situ biopreservation of Indian cheese and raw poultry meat was attempted and the colony count of Alternaria was significantly (p < 0.05, Bonferroni Holm) reduced in presence of L. acidophilus. Dip and Keep approach of preservation for Mangifera and Momordica were carried out in which microbial spoilage was not observed up to 6 days.
TI  - Role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  - Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. Following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285((R)) and Lactobacillus casei LBC80R((R)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical MRSA isolates, we conducted a literature search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment of S. aureus infection. As summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of S. aureus and clinical isolates of MRSA in vitro. The most active strains were Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Propionibacterium freudenreichii, Propionibacterium acnes, Lactobacillus paracasei, L. acidophilus, L. casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactococcus lactis. Their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. L. acidophilus also inhibited S. aureus biofilm formation and lipase production. In vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. S. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in vitro to L. acidophilus, whilst in vivo Bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. On the other hand, L. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against S. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with S. aureus in mice. Very few clinical data were found on the interactions between probiotics and MRSA, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of MRSA colonisation with probiotic use.
TI  - Comparing the efficacy of hyper-pure chlorine-dioxide with other oral antiseptics on oral pathogen microorganisms and biofilm in vitro.
AB  - This study examines the antibacterial properties of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl),  chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX), Listerine(R), and high purity chlorine dioxide (Solumium, ClO2) on selected common oral pathogen microorganisms and on dental biofilm in vitro. Antimicrobial activity of oral antiseptics was compared to the gold standard phenol. We investigated Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Veillonella alcalescens, Eikenella corrodens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Candida albicans as some important representatives of the oral pathogens. Furthermore, we collected dental plaque from the upper first molars of healthy young students. Massive biofilm was formed in vitro and its reduction was measured after treating it with mouthrinses: CHX, Listerine(R) or hyper pure ClO2. Their biofilm disrupting effect was measured after dissolving the crystal violet stain from biofilm by photometer. The results have showed that hyper pure ClO2 solution is more effective than other currently used disinfectants in case of aerobic bacteria and Candida yeast. In case of anaerobes its efficiency is similar to CHX solution. The biofilm dissolving effect of hyper pure ClO2 is significantly stronger compared to CHX and Listerine(R) after 5 min treatment. In conclusion, hyper pure ClO2 has a potent disinfectant efficacy on oral pathogenic microorganisms and a powerful biofilm dissolving effect compared to the current antiseptics, therefore high purity ClO2 may be a new promising preventive and therapeutic adjuvant in home oral care and in dental or oral surgery practice.
TI  - Probiotics for rectal volume variation during radiation therapy for prostate cancer.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus on  the percentage volume change of the rectum (PVCR), a crucial factor of prostate movement. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Prostate cancer patients managed with tomotherapy as a radical treatment were enrolled in the study to take a probiotic capsule containing 1.0x10(8) colony-forming units of L acidophilus or a placebo capsule twice daily. Radiation therapy was performed at a dose of 78 Gy in 39 fractions. The PVCR, defined as the difference in rectal volume between the planning computed tomographic (CT) and daily megavoltage CT images, was analyzed. RESULTS: Forty patients were randomized into 2 groups. The L acidophilus group showed significantly lower median rectal volume and median PVCR values than the placebo group. L acidophilus showed a significant reduction effect on the PVCR (P<.001). However, the radiation therapy fraction number did not significantly influence the PVCR. CONCLUSIONS: L acidophilus was useful in reducing the PVCR, which is the most important determining factor of prostate position, during radiation therapy for prostate cancer.
TI  - Evaluation of bean and soy tempeh influence on intestinal bacteria and estimation of antibacterial properties of bean tempeh.
AB  - In this study the effect of bean tempeh on the growth of Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus paracasei bacteria was investigated. Antibacterial activity was observed only in relation to the bacteria Bacillus subtilis. The effect of tempeh products on human intestinal microflora was also assessed. Bean and soy tempeh were culinarily processed and next digested in conditions simulating the human digestive tract (one of the digestive tracts was equipped with a mechanism simulating absorption). Soy tempeh stimulated most the growth of bacteria of the genus Bifidobacterium, while bean tempeh that of Escherichia coli. Using simulation of absorption for the digestion of fried soy tempeh resulted in a higher rise in the bacteria count of the genus Lactobacillus, while after digestion of fried bean tempeh the highest increase was recorded for Bifidobacterium and E. coli.
TI  - Effect of daily consumption of probiotic yoghurt on serum levels of calcium, iron and liver enzymes in pregnant women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To reach fetal appropriate growth during the third trimester, the requirements for dietary calcium and iron intakes during the pregnancy increases. This study was carried out to determine the effects of daily consumption of probiotic yoghurt on serum calcium and iron levels and liver enzymes among Iranian healthy pregnant women. METHODS: In this controlled clinical trial, 70 primigravida pregnant women carrying singleton pregnancy at their third trimester were participated. Participants were randomly divided into two groups of consuming 200 g/d of conventional (n = 33) or probiotic yogurts (n = 37) for 9 weeks. The probiotic yogurt contained Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis with a total of min 1 x 10(7) CFU. To measure serum calcium, iron, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, blood samples were drawn in a fasting state at baseline and after 9 weeks intervention. RESULTS: Consumption of probiotic yogurt resulted in maintaining serum calcium levels compared with the conventional yogurt (P = 0.01). Within-group differences in the conventional yogurt group revealed a significant reduction of serum calcium levels (-1.7 mg/dL, P < 0.0001). No significant differences were found between the two yogurts in terms of their effects on serum iron, AST and ALT levels. CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of probiotic yogurt among pregnant women resulted in maintaining serum calcium levels compared with the conventional yogurt; however, it could not affect serum iron, ALT and AST levels.
TI  - Antimicrobial Effect of Jasminum grandiflorum L. and Hibiscus rosa-sinensis L. Extracts Against Pathogenic Oral Microorganisms - An In Vitro Comparative Study.
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess and compare the antimicrobial potential and determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Jasminum grandiflorum and Hibiscus rosa-sinensis extracts as potential anti-pathogenic agents in dental caries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Aqueous and ethanol (cold and hot) extracts prepared from leaves of Jasminum grandiflorum and Hibiscus rosa-sinensis were screened for in vitro antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus using the agar well diffusion method. The lowest concentration of every extract considered as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined for both test organisms. Statistical analysis was performed with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: At lower concentrations, hot ethanol Jasminum grandiflorum (10 mug/ml) and Hibiscus rosa-sinensis (25 mug/ml) extracts were found to have statistically significant (P </= 0.05) antimicrobial activity against S. mutans and L. acidophilus with MIC values of 6.25 mug/ml and 25 mug/ml, respectively. A proportional increase in their antimicrobial activity (zone of inhibition) was observed. CONCLUSION: Both extracts were found to be antimicrobially active and contain compounds with therapeutic potential. Nevertheless, clinical trials on the effect of these plants are essential before advocating large-scale therapy.
TI  - Development of a tiered multilocus sequence typing scheme for members of the Lactobacillus acidophilus complex.
AB  - Members of the Lactobacillus acidophilus complex are associated with functional foods and dietary supplements because of purported health benefits they impart to the consumer. Many characteristics of these microorganisms are reported to be strain specific. Therefore, proper strain typing is essential for safety assessment and product labeling, and also for monitoring strain integrity for industrial production purposes. Fifty-two strains of the L. acidophilus complex (L. acidophilus, L. amylovorus, L. crispatus, L. gallinarum, L. gasseri, and L. johnsonii) were genotyped using two established methods and compared to a novel multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme. PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis of the hsp60 gene with AluI and TaqI successfully clustered 51 of the 52 strains into the six species examined, but it lacked strain-level discrimination. Random amplified polymorphic DNA PCR (RAPD-PCR) targeting the M13 sequence resulted in highly discriminatory profiles but lacked reproducibility. In this study, an MLST scheme was developed using the conserved housekeeping genes fusA, gpmA, gyrA, gyrB, lepA, pyrG, and recA, which identified 40 sequence types that successfully clustered all of the strains into the six species. Analysis of the observed alleles suggests that nucleotide substitutions within five of the seven MLST loci have reached saturation, a finding that emphasizes the highly diverse nature of the L. acidophilus complex and our unconventional application of a typically intraspecies molecular typing tool. Our MLST results indicate that this method could be useful for characterization and strain discrimination of a multispecies complex, with the potential for taxonomic expansion to a broader collection of Lactobacillus species.
TI  - Species-specific quantification of probiotic lactobacilli in yoghurt by quantitative real-time PCR.
AB  - AIMS: Lactobacilli strains with probiotic effects have been widely used in dairy  products such as yoghurts as well as in food additives and pharmaceuticals. Despite their successful commercial application, the current species identification and quantification methods of the genus Lactobacillus are time-consuming and labour-intensive. METHODS AND RESULTS: To fulfil the requirements of a robust quality management, we have developed a quantitative real-time PCR assay based on the heat shock protein 60 gene (hsp60) for accurate identification and quantification of five commercially important Lactobacillus species. The developed assay allows an unambiguous species-specific detection of the species Lact. acidophilus, Lact. brevis, Lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lact. helveticus and Lact. reuteri from bacterial cultures as well as directly from dairy products for instance yoghurt. CONCLUSIONS: With the assay, we were able to specifically detect lactobacilli strains down to 10(5) CFU ml(-1) directly from yoghurt, which is a sufficient detection limit as commercial products usually contain 10(6) -10(12) CFU ml(-1) of probiotic strains. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The real-time PCR assay developed here might become a convenient tool enabling an accurate, fast and sensitive detection of probiotic lactobacilli commercially used in food.
TI  - [Particular behavior of different Lactobacillus acidophilus strains in petit-suisse cheese].
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the physico-chemical and microbiological characteristics of petit-suisse cheeses manufactured with the addition of two Lactobacillus acidophilus strains: LA-14 (potentially probiotic) and La-5 (probiotic culture), using Streptococcus thermophilus TA040 as starter culture. Three cheese-making trials were prepared: Q1 (control: with TA040), Q2 (with TA040 + LA-14), and Q3 (with TA040 + La-5). Parameters analyzed included microbial counts of probiotic, potentially probiotic and starter microorganisms, and physico-chemical parameters (pH and moisture) after 1, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days of storage of the product at 4 +/- 1 degree C. Viable counts of L. acidophilus remained between 7.46 and 7.62 log CFU g(-1) for La-5, and between 6.39 and 6.83 log CFU g(-1) for LA-14. As for the starter, higher populations were observed for Q2 (9.58-9.68 log CFU g(-1)) and Q3 (9.42-9.79 log CFU g(-1)), when compared to Q1, which suggests synergism between L. acidophilus and the starter culture. Moisture and pH values remained stable for cheeses Q1, Q2, and Q3, and no significant differences were detected between cheeses after the first day of storage (p > 0.05). Particular features of both L. acidophilus strains determined different behavior in petit-suisse cheese, and the better adaptation of the La-5 to the product environment was perceptible, since higher populations were observed when compared to LA-14.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus La5, Bifidobacterium BB12, and Lactobacillus casei DN001 modulate gene expression of subset specific transcription factors and cytokines in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of obese and overweight people.
AB  - Probiotics are believed to have interaction with immune cells through sustained effects on gene expression of different cytokines and transcription factors. The present randomized doubled-blind controlled clinical trial was performed recruiting 75 individuals with BMI 25-35, who were randomly assigned to the following three groups: Group 1 (n = 25) who consumed regular yogurt as part of a low calorie diet [RLCD], group 2 (n = 25) who received probiotic yogurt with a LCD [PLCD] and group 3 (n = 25) who consumed probiotic yogurt without LCD [PWLCD] for 8 week. Participants in PLCD and PWLCD groups received 200 g/day yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus La5, Bifidobacterium Bb12, and lactobacillus casei DN001 10(8) cfu/gr. The expression of the FOXP3, T-bet, GATA3, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, TGF-beta, and ROR-gammat in PBMCs genes were assessed, before and after intervention. In three groups, ROR-gammat expression was reduced (P = 0.007) and FOXP3 was increased (P < 0.001). The expression of TNFalpha, TGFbeta, and GATA3 genes did not change among all groups after intervention. Interestingly, the expression of T-bet gene, which was significantly decreased in PLCD and PWLCD groups (P < 0.001), whereas gene expression of IFN-gamma decreased in all three groups. Our results suggest that weight loss diet and probiotic yogurt had synergistic effects on T-cell subset specific gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells among overweight and obese individuals.
TI  - Simultaneous improvement of specificity and affinity of aptamers against Streptococcus mutans by in silico maturation for biosensor development.
AB  - In silico evolution with an in vitro system can facilitate the development of functional aptamers with high specificity and affinity. Although a general technique known as systematic evolution of ligand by exponential enrichment (SELEX) is an efficient method for aptamer selection, it sometimes fails to identify aptamers with sufficient binding properties. We have previously developed in silico maturation (ISM) to improve functions of aptamers based on genetic algorithms. ISM represents an intelligent exploitation of a random search within a defined sequence space to optimize aptamer sequences and improve their function of interest. Here we demonstrated a successful application of ISM of aptamers to simultaneously improve specificity and affinity for Streptococcus mutans with discovery of a core sequence, which was required to form a polymerized guanine quadruplex structure for target binding. We applied ISM to aptamers selected by whole-cell SELEX and identified an aptamer with up to 16-fold improvement in affinity compared to its parent aptamers, and specificity was increased to show 12-fold more binding to S. mutans than to Lactobacillus acidophilus. Furthermore, we demonstrated a specific flow-through detection of S. mutans at a concentration range of 1 x 10(5) -10(8) CFU/mL using the evolved aptamer immobilized on gold colloids.
TI  - Analysis of cariogenic bacteria in saliva of cancer patients.
AB  - This study examined salivary flow and salivary pH and the prevalence and levels of cariogenic bacteria in the saliva of oncological patients and healthy controls. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to assess the levels of microbes including Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Lactobacillus acidophilus in the saliva of 41 patients with a solid tumor (SO), 30 patients with a hematologic malignancy (HE), and 40 healthy controls. Salivary flow and pH were lower in oncological patients than in controls. The frequencies of all four cariogenic bacteria were highest in the SO group. S. mutans and L. salivarius were the most commonly detected in all three study groups. Mean numbers of S. sobrinus and L. salivarius in the SO group were significantly higher than in controls (p<0.05). There were no significant differences between patients and controls with respect to mean numbers of S. mutans and L. acidophilus in saliva. However, the proportions of S. mutans, S. sobrinus, and L. salivarius versus total bacteria in the SO group were significantly higher than in controls. Within patients, both mean numbers and the proportions of S. mutans and S. sobrinus were significantly different (p<0.05). In summary, significant differences were found in salivary pH values and the levels of S. mutans, S. sobrinus, and L. salivarius between SO patients and healthy controls.
TI  - Identification of extracellular surface-layer associated proteins in Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM.
AB  - Bacterial surface (S-) layers are crystalline arrays of self-assembling, proteinaceous subunits called S-layer proteins (Slps), with molecular masses ranging from 40 to 200 kDa. The S-layer-forming bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM expresses three major Slps: SlpA (46 kDa), SlpB (47 kDa) and SlpX (51 kDa). SlpA has a demonstrated role in adhesion to Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells in vitro, and has been shown to modulate dendritic cell (DC) and T-cell functionalities with murine DCs. In this study, a modification of a standard lithium chloride S-layer extraction revealed 37 proteins were solubilized from the S-layer wash fraction. Of these, 30 have predicted cleavage sites for secretion, 24 are predicted to be extracellular, six are lipid-anchored, three have N-terminal hydrophobic membrane spanning regions and four are intracellular, potentially moonlighting proteins. Some of these proteins, designated S-layer associated proteins (SLAPs), may be loosely associated with or embedded within the bacterial S-layer complex. Lba-1029, a putative SLAP gene, was deleted from the chromosome of L. acidophilus. Phenotypic characterization of the deletion mutant demonstrated that the SLAP LBA1029 contributes to a pro-inflammatory TNF-alpha response from murine DCs. This study identified extracellular proteins and putative SLAPs of L. acidophilus NCFM using LC-MS/MS. SLAPs appear to impart important surface display features and immunological properties to microbes that are coated by S-layers.
TI  - [Assessment of safety and effectiveness of dietary fermented milk product using in the presence of dysbiosis in people with overweight and obesity].
AB  - The study was aimed at assessment of quality, safety and nutritional efficiency of consuming fermented milk product prepared on the basis of symbioticcal ferment of two strains of acidophilic bacteria Lactobacillius acidophilius D-75 and Lactobacillius acidophilius D-76, by two groups of patients with overweight and obesity combined with dysbiosis. Including fermented milk product into diet proved to have positive nutritional effect. It can be recommended to include probiotic fermented milk product into the diet of patients with such pathology.
TI  - Enhancement of the immune response against Salmonella infection of mice by heat-killed multispecies combinations of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Heat-killed lactic acid bacteria (LAB) has advantages over live LAB in that it has a long shelf-life and is therefore easy to store and transport. From four LAB strains selected by immunomodulatory activity and adherent properties, we prepared the heat-killed multispecies combination of LAB (MLAB) and the cell walls from MLAB under two conditions (100 degrees C for 30 min and 121 degrees C for 15 min). Different effects on the adherent properties of these four LAB strains were observed, depending on the heating conditions. With mouse macrophage cells, the two heat-killed MLABs (HMLABs) showed significantly higher induction activities on the production of interleukin 12 (IL-12) than their individual strains did. Heat-killed MLABs and cell-wall preparations were able to reduce the Salmonella invasion of Caco-2 and mouse macrophage cells. Feeding mice with HMLAB could inhibit the Salmonella invasion of mice significantly. For these mice, the expression level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha and IL-6, in mouse serum was reduced while that of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, i.e. IL-10, was enhanced. The HMLABs developed in this study showed higher protective effect against Salmonella invasion either of Caco-2 cells or of mice, relative to the heat-killed lactobacilli, which consisted of Lactobacillus acidophilus strains selected at random. In conclusion, the HMLABs were potentially useful for the protection of mice against Salmonella infection and the induced inflammation.
TI  - An in vitro study on the secondary caries-prevention properties of three restorative materials.
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Secondary caries is considered to be the most important and common reason for the replacement of all types of restorations. PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to evaluate in vitro both the anticaries efficacy and marginal integrity of amalgam, glass ionomer cement, and composite resin restorations in a cariogenic condition. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Class II cavities were prepared on 60 extracted teeth, which were assigned to 3 groups and restored either with amalgam, glass ionomer, or composite resin. After thermal cycling and sterilization, the teeth were set in an artificial carious environment for 10 days. The bacteria from the margin of the restorations were then collected, and microleakage was evaluated by means of dyeing. According to the locations, the demineralization of tooth tissue around the restoration was divided into 3 parts: artificial outer lesion, artificial enamel wall lesion, and artificial dentin wall lesion. The depths of the artificial outer lesion and the areas of the artificial enamel and dentin wall lesions were investigated with a confocal laser scanning microscope after all the specimens had been stained with 0.1 mM Rhodamine B. Statistical analyses consisted of 1-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests (alpha=.05). RESULTS: No significant difference was noted in terms of the number of bacteria around the restorations for the 3 materials; the microleakage of amalgam was the least among the 3 types of restorations; the outer enamel lesion depth around the glass ionomer cement was the lowest, and the wall lesion area around the amalgam was the smallest. CONCLUSIONS: No definite inhibitory effect of fluoride releasing restorative materials (glass ionomer) was apparent on Lactobacillus acidophilus in this study. The amalgam restorations showed the best marginal integrity and the smallest artificial wall lesion among the 3 types of restorations.
TI  - Purification and characterization of anti-Alicyclobacillus bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  - Lactobacillus rhamnosus CICC 20975 produces a 6,502-Da bacteriocin, named bacteriocin RC 20975, active against Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus brevis, Bacillus subtilis, and Listeria innocua. This bacteriocin is not quite heat stable but is effective after refrigerated storage and freeze-thaw cycles. Bacteriocin RC 20975 was added at a concentration of 256 AU/ml to the endospores of A. acidoterrestris DSM 3922; no viable cells were detected after 24 h. The primary mode of action of bacteriocin RC 20975 seems to be the formation of pores, as indicated by K(+) efflux from metabolically active cells of A. acidoterrestris. However, efflux of larger cytoplasmic content was not observed within the first 30 min after bacteriocin RC 20975 treatment. In addition, adsorption of bacteriocin RC 20975 to target cells at different temperatures and pH levels and in the presence of surfactants was studied. Finally, the effect that different media, media components, and addition of vitamins to the media had on bacteriocin RC 20975 production was also studied.
TI  - Differences in vaginal lactobacilli composition of Iranian healthy and bacterial  vaginosis infected women: a comparative analysis of their cytotoxic effects with commercial vaginal probiotics.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaginal flora of healthy women is dominated by Lactobacillus species  which can prevent bacterial vaginosis. OBJECTIVES: The current study aimed to determine the differences in vaginal lactobacilli composition of Iranian healthy and bacterial vaginosis (BV) infected women and compared their cytotoxic effects with commercial vaginal probiotics. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and seventy eight vaginal specimens were collected from healthy and BV infected women. Lactobacillus colonies were obtained by culturing on laked blood BHI and MRS medias and genetically defined by 16s rRNA sequencing. Differentiating the specimens to normal, intermediate and BV infected were carried out by Ison and Hey grading protocol. Identification of Lactobacillus strains in vaginal specimens were performed by Multiplex PCR. The inhibitory effects of lactobacilli on Hela (tumoral cervical cells) and HNCF-pi52 (normal cervical cells) were conducted by MTT and trypan blue assays. RESULTS: L. crispatus, L. gasseri, L. iners, L. jensenii, L. acidophilus and L. rhamnosus were the most frequently occurring species in vagina of healthy Iranian women. L. crispatus and L. jensenni were significantly higher in the normal than in the BV infected groups. Also the cytotoxic effect of L. crispatus on tumoral cervical cells was higher than other lactobacilli including commercial probiotics. CONCLUSIONS: As L. crispatus and L. jensenni were significantly higher in BV infected women and the cytotoxic effect of L. crispatus on tumoral cervical cells was high, introduction of new probiotics seems necessary.
TI  - Efficacy profiles for different concentrations of Lactobacillus acidophilus in experimental colitis.
AB  - AIM: To determine the efficacy profiles of different concentrations of Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) for treating colitis using an experimental murine model. METHODS: Colitis was established in 64 BALB/c mice by adding 5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to the drinking water and allowing ad libitum access for 7 d. The mice were then randomly divided into the following control and experimental model groups (n = 8 each; day 0): untreated model control; negative-treatment model control (administered gavage of 1 mL/10 g normal saline); experimental-treatment models C4-C8 (administered gavage of 10(4), 10(5), 10(6), 10(7), or 10(8) CFU/10 g L. acidophilus, respectively); positive-treatment model control (administration of the anti-inflammatory agent prednisone acetate at 45 mug/10 g). Eight mice given regular water (no DSS) and no subsequent treatments served as the normal control group. Body weight, fecal traits, and presence of fecal occult blood were assessed daily. All animals were sacrificed on post-treatment day 7 to measure colonic length, perform histological scoring, and quantify the major bacteria in the proximal and distal colon. Intergroup differences were determined by one-way ANOVA and post-hoc Student-Newman-Keuls comparison. RESULTS: All treatments (L. acidophilus and prednisone acetate) protected against colitis-induced weight loss (P < 0.05 vs model and normal control groups). The extent of colitis-induced colonic shortening was significantly reduced by all treatments (prednisone acetate > C4 > C5 > C7 > C8 > C6; P < 0.05 vs untreated model group), and the C6 group showed colonic length similar to that of the normal control group (P > 0.05). The C6 group also had the lowest disease activity index scores among the model groups. The bacterial profiles in the proximal colon were similar between all of the experimental-treatment model groups (all P > 0.05). In contrast, the bacterial profile in the distal colon of the C6 group showed the distinctive features (P < 0.05 vs all other experimental-treatment model groups) of Lactobacillus sp. and Bifidobacterium sp. being the most abundant bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus being the least abundant bacteria. CONCLUSION: The most therapeutically efficacious concentration of L. acidophilus (10(6) CFU/10 g) may exert its effects by modulating the bacterial profile in the distal colon.
TI  - Draft Genome Sequences of Five Strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Strain CIP 76.13T, Isolated from Humans, Strains CIRM-BIA 442 and CIRM-BIA 445, Isolated from Dairy Products, and Strains DSM 20242 and DSM 9126 of Unknown Origin.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus is a natural inhabitant of mammalian gastrointestinal systems and is used in dairy and pharmaceutical products. Five draft genome sequences, covering 1,995,790 nucleotides (nt) on average, are divided into 19 to 34 scaffolds covering 1,995 to 2,053 genes. The draft genome sequences were compared to the sequence of the L. acidophilus NCFM dairy strain.
TI  - Anticariogenic and phytochemical evaluation of Eucalyptus globules Labill.
AB  - In the present study, in vitro anticariogenic potential of ethyl acetate, hexane  and methanol and aqueous extracts of plant leaves of Eucalyptus globules Labill. were evaluated by using four cariogenic bacteria, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus mutans. Agar well diffusion method and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were used for this purpose. The ethyl acetate extracted fraction of plant leaves showed good inhibitory effects against all selected bacteria. In Eucalyptus globules, hexane and ethyl acetate extracts found highly effective against, Lactobacillus acidophilus with MIC value of 0.031 and 0.062 mg/mL, respectively. Qualitative phytochemical investigation of above extracts showed the presence of alkaloids, phenolic compounds, steroids, cardiac glycosides and terpenes. Based on the MIC value and bioautography, ethyl acetate of plant leaf was selected for further study. Further investigation on the structure elucidation of the bioactive compound using IR, GC-MS and NMR techniques revealed the presence of alpha-farnesene, a sesquiterpene. Eucalyptus globules plant leaf extracts have great potential as anticariogenic agents that may be useful in the treatment of oral disease.
TI  - Probiotic administration in early life, atopy, and asthma: a meta-analysis of clinical trials.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Probiotics may reduce the risk of atopy and asthma in children. However, results from clinical trials have been conflicting, and several of them may have been underpowered. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials to assess the effects of probiotic supplementation on atopic sensitization and asthma/wheeze prevention in children. METHODS: Random-effects models were used to calculate pooled risk estimates. Meta-regression was conducted to examine the effect of potential factors on probiotics efficacy. RESULTS: Probiotics were effective in reducing total immunoglobulin E (IgE) (mean reduction: -7.59 U/mL [95% confidence interval (CI): -14.96 to -0.22]; P = .044). Meta-regression showed that the reduction in IgE was more pronounced with longer follow-up. Probiotics significantly reduced the risk of atopic sensitization when administered prenatally (relative risk: 0.88 [95% CI: 0.78 to 0.99]; P = .035 for positive result on the skin prick test and/or elevated specific IgE to common allergens) and postnatally (relative risk: 0.86 [95% CI: 0.75 to 0.98]; P = .027 for positive result on skin prick test). Administration of Lactobacillus acidophilus, compared with other strains, was associated with an increased risk of atopic sensitization (P = .002). Probiotics did not significantly reduce asthma/wheeze (relative risk: 0.96 [95% CI: 0.85 to 1.07]). CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal and/or early-life probiotic administration reduces the risk of atopic sensitization and decreases the total IgE level in children but may not reduce the risk of asthma/wheeze. Follow-up duration and strain significantly modified these effects. Future trials for asthma prevention should carefully select probiotic strain and consider longer follow-up.
TI  - Long-term treatment with probiotics in primary care patients with irritable bowel syndrome--a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE. Meta-analyses have indicated effect of probiotics on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, few long-term trials have been conducted and uncertainty remains as to effectiveness and long-term effect in a primary care setting. We aimed to investigate the effect of probiotics compared with placebo in the management of IBS in primary care during a 6-month treatment period and with a 6-month follow-up. MATERIAL AND METHODS. We randomized IBS patients fulfilling Rome III criteria to receive two capsules twice daily either containing placebo or a probiotic mixture of Lactobacillus paracasei ssp paracasei F19, Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 and Bifidobacterium Bb12 in an amount of 1.3 x 10(10) CFU per capsule. Primary endpoint was proportion of responders defined as patients reporting adequate relief (AR) at least 50% of the time in the 6-month treatment period. Secondary outcomes were proportions of patients reporting AR at different time points, and change in gastrointestinal symptoms and health-related quality of life (HrQOL) from baseline to 6 and 12 months. RESULTS. A total of 131 patients were included in this study. The proportion of responders in the treatment period was 52% (35/67) in the probiotic group versus 41% (26/64) in the placebo group, p = 0.18. Overall we found no difference between the groups in change in gastrointestinal symptoms after treatment. Patients improved in HrQOL, but with no statistically significant difference between the groups. CONCLUSION. During a 6-month treatment period, we were not able to detect a positive effect of probiotic when compared with placebo.
TI  - [System analysis of the relationship between the metabolism of vitamins by micro-biota and the survival of the positive microflora of the digestive tract].
AB  - A perspective direction of the treatment of dysbacteriosis is the use of so-called metabolic prebiotics--products of metabolism of positive flora (for example, water substrate of the products of metabolism of E. coli, S. faecalis, L. acidophilus, L. helveticus (strains of DSM), out of which, as known, drug Hylak Forte is made. Our earlier systematic analysis of metabolomics, representatives of positive microflora, pointed to the fact that the latter contain specific biochemical mechanisms for biosynthesis and processing of a number of vitamins. In the present paper the results of a systematic analysis of the effects of vitamins B2, B6 and K on the survival of the representatives of the positive microflora on the basis of the substrate of metabolic products of positive flora have been presented. The results of the analysis allow us clarify the molecular mechanisms of the therapeutic effects of this drug with a very complex structure and confirm the available clinical data and are an important foundation for subsequent microbiological research. Metabolites in the preparation composition contribute to the normalization of metabolism of pyridoxalphosphate (vitamin B6), flavin adenin dinucleotide (FAD, a derivative of vitamin B2) and nicotinamide dinucleotide (NAD, a derivative of vitamin B3)--cofactors of enzymes that have a significant impact on the survival of microbiota. The proposed molecular mechanisms also indicate on a possible synergies between certain vitamins and micro elements, on the one hand, and molecular components of the preparations on the basis of waste products of microbiota on the other.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 induce different age-related metabolic profiles revealed by 1H-NMR spectroscopy in urine and feces of mice.
AB  - Age-related dysbioses of intestinal microbiota and decline in the overall metabolic homeostasis are frequently found in the elderly. Probiotic supplementation may represent a way to prevent or reduce the senescence-associated metabolic disorders. The present study evaluated the metabolic impact of Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 supplementation in relation to age by analyzing urine and feces metabolic profiles using (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and multivariate analysis. Adult (3 mo old) and aged (16 mo old) mice received an oral supplementation of the 2 probiotics (1 x 10(9) colony-forming units/d each) or phosphate buffered saline (control) daily for 30 d. Urine and feces were collected for 48 h before the end of the study. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis showed that the urinary discriminant metabolites for the probiotic treatment included higher dimethylglycine in adult and aged mice, lower sarcosine and nicotinate in adult mice, higher N-methylnicotinamide in adult mice and lower N-methylnicotinamide in aged mice compared with their controls. These results indicate a probiotic-induced modulation of homocysteine and NAD metabolism pathways, which have important implications because these pathways are involved in essential cellular processes that can be altered in senescence. The probiotic supplementation also modified the fecal metabolic profiles, inducing in both adult and aged mice higher 4-hydroxyphenylacetate and lower xylose in treated mice compared with their control mice, whereas valerate was greater in treated adult mice and lower in treated aged mice compared with their controls. The ANOVA simultaneous component analysis on urinary and fecal metabolic profiling showed an age x treatment interaction (P < 0.05), confirming the age-related modulation of the metabolic response to probiotic supplementation. The results suggest that L. acidophilus and B. lactis may prevent or reduce age-related metabolic dysfunction.
TI  - The metabolic effect of resistant starch and yoghurt on the renal and faecal nitrogen and ammonia excretion in humans as measured by lactose-[(15)N2]ureide.
AB  - Resistant starch (RS) and Lactobacillus acidophilus yoghurt (LC1) were supplemented simultaneously in healthy adults to evaluate the effect on the urinary and faecal nitrogen and ammonia excretion by means of lactose-[(15)N2]ureide ((15)N-LU) degradation. Nineteen subjects received a regular daily diet either without or with supplementation of an RS-LC1-mixture composed of fibre of potatoes (RS type 1), wrinkle pea starch (RS type 2), and LC1 over a 20-day period in randomised order. Thereafter, (15)N-LU was administered together with breakfast. Urine and faeces were collected over a period of 48 and 72 h, respectively. The (15)N abundances were measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. The intake of the pre- and probiotic mixture composed of RS of type 1, type 2 and of LC1 significantly lowered the colonic generation and the renal excretion of toxic (15)NH3 and functioned as an ammonia shift from urinary to faecal (15)N excretion when using (15)N-LU as a xenobiotic marker.
TI  - Probiotic supplementation in mothers of very low birth weight infants.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Oral probiotic supplementation reduces the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in preterm infants. Concerns about safety and purity of probiotic preparations have limited their use in preterm infants. The authors administered probiotic bacteria to mothers of preterm infants, thereby avoiding the risks of direct exposure of infants to probiotic bacteria. DESIGN: This prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial at the Tel Aviv Medical Center (June 2007-November 2009) examined the effects of maternal oral probiotic supplementation on the incidence of NEC, death, and sepsis in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants fed with maternal breast milk. Mothers were assigned to supplementation with Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacteria lactis 2 x 10(E) [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED] CFU/d or to placebo starting from 1 to 3 days postpartum. The primary outcome measures were NEC, sepsis, and death. RESULTS: In total 49 mothers of 58 VLBW infants were recruited. A total of 25 infants were in the probiotic group and 33 in the placebo group. The overall incidence of Bell stage II to III NEC was 12%, with an incidence of 4% in the infants of the probiotic group and 18.2% in the placebo group (p = 0.12), respectively. Sepsis and mortality rates were similar. CONCLUSION: Postpartum maternal supplementation with probiotic bacteria may decrease the incidence of NEC in breastfed infants.
TI  - Stress response of some lactic acid bacteria isolated from Romanian artisan dairy products.
AB  - Understanding the mechanisms of stress response and adaptation to stress in the case of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), especially in the case of strains with functional properties, is very important when such strains are potential candidates for starter cultures or probiotics. In this context, our study shows the response of some LAB [four exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing strains and one strain with potential probiotic effect] to the stresses induced by low and high incubation temperatures, acidity, NaCl, and bile salts, often encountered during the technological processes in food or during the passage through the human gastro-intestinal tract. The strains were able to grow at temperatures up to 40 degrees C (the mesophilic strains) and 47 degrees C (the thermophilic strain), in medium with an initial pH of at least 4.0 (Lactobacillus acidophilus IBB801), or in the presence of NaCl up to 10% (Weissella confusa/cibaria 38.2), or bile salts up to 0.2% (L. acidophilus IBB801). The protein and isoenzyme patterns of the strains subjected to various stress conditions presented several differences compared with the control patterns, among which the overexpression of some proteins of about 50-60 kDa, differences in the bands intensity in the case of the intracellular enzymes, or the complete loss of some of these bands. The best survival to low pH values and high temperatures was observed for strain L. acidophilus IBB801, the candidate probiotic strain. The EPS production of the four tested strains was, in general, directly related to the growth, the highest yields being obtained when strains were incubated at 24 degrees C.
TI  - Impact of adding prophylactic probiotics to a bundle of standard preventative measures for Clostridium difficile infections: enhanced and sustained decrease in the incidence and severity of infection at a community hospital.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2003, hospitals in Quebec, Canada experienced an increase of NAP1/027 Clostridium difficile infections following antibiotic administration (CDIAA). At Pierre-Le Gardeur Hospital (PLGH), the incidence increased from 10 to over 25 cases per 1000 patient admissions. METHODS: We report a quasi-experimental, prospective cohort study evaluating the effect on CDIAA of a probiotic added to existing C. difficile infection (CDI) standard preventative measures (SPM) in 31,832 hospitalized patients receiving antibiotics. Phase I (1580) measured the impact of SPM alone. In Phase II, 50 to 60 x 10(9) cfu daily dose of oral Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285 and L. casei LBC80R probiotic formula (Bio-K+) was administered to all patients receiving antibiotics. Phase III included the same intervention after a move to a new hospital facility. Phases II and III included 4968 patients. During Phase IV, 25,284 patients were submitted to the same regimen but outcome data were compared to those of similar hospitals in Quebec. RESULTS: At the end of Phase III, CDIAA had decreased from more than 18 cases per 1000 patient admissions in Phase I to less than 5 cases. Reductions of CDI cases (73%) (p < 0.001) and severe CDI cases (76.4%) (p < 0.001) were observed. CDI recurrence rate was reduced by 39% (p < 0.001). During the following 6 years, the CDI rate averaged 2.71 cases per 10,000 patient-days at PLGH compared to 8.50 cases per 10,000 patient-days in equivalent hospitals located in Quebec. STUDY LIMITATION: This study is not a randomized clinical trial; it is an open prospective study and should be treated as such. Also, following Phase II, PLGH moved into a new facility and this could have contributed to lower CDI. CONCLUSIONS: Specific probiotic product added to SPM and antibiotic stewardship activities resulted in a further reduction in CDI rates and was shown to be safe.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus supplementation in human subjects and their resistance  to enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli infection.
AB  - To assess the effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 700396) on enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) infection, in the present study, a parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled 4-week intervention was performed in healthy males. The subjects largely consumed their habitual diet, but had to abstain from consuming dairy foods generally high in Ca. The subjects were randomised into the L. acidophilus (dose 10(9) colony-forming units twice daily; n 20) or the placebo (n 19) group. After an adaptation period of 2 weeks, the subjects were orally infected with a live, but attenuated, ETEC vaccine, able to induce mild, short-lived symptoms. Before and after the challenge, the subjects recorded stool consistency, bowel habits, and frequency and severity of gastrointestinal complaints. The ETEC challenge led to a significant increase in faecal output on the 2nd day and a concomitant increase in Bristol stool scale scores. Likewise, abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, fever, headache and nausea peaked 1 d after the oral challenge. The concentrations of faecal calprotectin and IgA peaked 2 d after and that of serum IgM peaked 9 and 15 d after the oral challenge. The concentrations of serum IgA and IgG were unaffected. The ETEC challenge led to a reduction in the number of Bacteroides-Prevotella, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium cluster XIVab and total faecal bacteria. Probiotic treatment was associated with a larger increase in Bristol stool scale scores and more fever, headache and nausea after the ETEC challenge compared with the placebo treatment. These differences were, however, small and with substantial variation within the groups. Oral application of an attenuated live ETEC vaccine provides a useful model for food-borne infections. Supplementation with L. acidophilus ATCC 700396, however, was ineffective in reducing ETEC infection symptoms in healthy men.
TI  - A PDMS/paper/glass hybrid microfluidic biochip integrated with aptamer-functionalized graphene oxide nano-biosensors for one-step multiplexed pathogen detection.
AB  - Infectious pathogens often cause serious public health concerns throughout the world. There is an increasing demand for simple, rapid and sensitive approaches for multiplexed pathogen detection. In this paper we have developed a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)/paper/glass hybrid microfluidic system integrated with aptamer-functionalized graphene oxide (GO) nano-biosensors for simple, one-step, multiplexed pathogen detection. The paper substrate used in this hybrid microfluidic system facilitated the integration of aptamer biosensors on the microfluidic biochip, and avoided complicated surface treatment and aptamer probe immobilization in a PDMS or glass-only microfluidic system. Lactobacillus acidophilus was used as a bacterium model to develop the microfluidic platform with a detection limit of 11.0 cfu mL(-1). We have also successfully extended this method to the simultaneous detection of two infectious pathogens - Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enterica. This method is simple and fast. The one-step 'turn on' pathogen assay in a ready-to-use microfluidic device only takes ~10 min to complete on the biochip. Furthermore, this microfluidic device has great potential in rapid detection of a wide variety of different other bacterial and viral pathogens.
TI  - Secreted aspartic peptidases of Candida albicans liberate bactericidal hemocidins from human hemoglobin.
AB  - Secreted aspartic peptidases (Saps) are a group of ten acidic hydrolases considered as key virulence factors of Candida albicans. These enzymes supply the fungus with nutrient amino acids as well as are able to degrade the selected host's proteins involved in the immune defense. Our previous studies showed that the human menstrual discharge is exceptionally rich in bactericidal hemoglobin (Hb) fragments - hemocidins. However, to date, the genesis of such peptides is unclear. The presented study demonstrates that the action of C. albicans isozymes Sap1-Sap6, Sap8 and Sap9, but not Sap7 and Sap10, toward human hemoglobin leads to limited proteolysis of this protein and generates a variety of antimicrobial hemocidins. We have identified these peptides and checked their activity against selected microorganisms representative for human vagina. We have also demonstrated that the process of Hb hydrolysis is most effective at pH 4.0, characteristic for vagina, and the liberated peptides showed pronounced killing activity toward Lactobacillus acidophilus, and to a lower degree, Escherichia coli. However, only a very weak activity toward Staphylococcus aureus and C. albicans was noticed. These findings provide interesting new insights into pathophysiology of human vaginal candidiasis and suggest that C. albicans may be able to compete with the other microorganisms of the same physiological niche using the microbicidal peptides generated from the host protein.
TI  - Inhibition of Cronobacter sakazakii by heat labile bacteriocins produced by probiotic LAB isolated from healthy infants.
AB  - Cronobacter sakazakii is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause bacteremia, meningitis, and necrotizing enterocolitis, most often in neonates with case-fatality rates that may reach 80%. The antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria against a wide range of foodborne pathogens is well-established in different types of food products. The objective of the current study was to investigate the antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. casei isolated from feces of healthy infants against different strains of C. sakazakii in agar and a rehydrated infant milk formula (RIMF) model. The inhibition zones of C. sakazakii around L. acidophilus or L. casei ranged from 22 to 32 mm on eMan Rogosa Sharpe (MRS) agar under aerobic conditions, while a slight reduction in antibacterial activity was noted on modified MRS (0.2% glucose) under anaerobic conditions. It was observed that pH-neutralized cell-free supernatant (CFS) of L. acidophilus or L. casei was inhibitory against tested C. sakazakii strains. The inhibition zones of neutralized CFS were lower than the antibacterial activities of live cultures. The antibacterial activity of CFS was abolished when CFS from L. acidophilus or L. casei was heated at 60 or 80 degrees C for either 10 min or 2 h, or treated with trypsin or pepsin. This was considered strong evidence that the inhibition was due to the production of bacteriocins by L. casei and L. acidophilus. Both the CFS and active growing cells of L. casei and L. acidophilus were able to reduce the viability of C. sakazakii in the RIMF model. The results may extend the use of natural antimicrobials instead of conventional preservation methods to improve the safety of RIMF.
TI  - Effects of 2 bracket and ligation types on plaque retention: a quantitative microbiologic analysis with real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of self-ligating  brackets and conventional brackets ligated with stainless steel ligatures on dental plaque retention and microbial flora. METHODS: Twenty boys (mean age, 14.2 +/- 1.5 years) underwent bonding with self-ligating bracket systems and conventional standard edgewise bracket systems ligated with stainless steel ligatures with a split-mouth design. Clinical measurements, including plaque index, probing pocket depth, and bleeding on probing, were obtained before bonding, 1 week after bonding, and 3 months after bonding. Supragingival plaque samples were obtained at baseline and 3 months after bonding for the detection of bacteria. A quantitative analysis for Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The Mann-Whitney U test and the Hotelling T(2) multivariate test were used for statistical comparisons of the groups. RESULTS: The numbers of S mutans, S sobrinus, L casei, and L acidophilus were not statistically different between self-ligating brackets and conventional brackets ligated with stainless steel ligatures (P >0.05). The 2 archwire ligation techniques showed no statistically significant differences in plaque index, bleeding on probing, and probing pocket depth values of the bonded teeth (P >0.05). All clinical parameters and the numbers of all microorganisms showed statistically significant increases from baseline to 3 months after bonding in both groups (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Self-ligating brackets and conventional brackets ligated with stainless steel ligatures do not differ with regard to dental plaque retention.
TI  - Effect of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, hs-CRP, and oxidative stress in patients with type 2 diabetes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We are aware of no study that has indicated the effects of daily consumption of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and oxidative stress in diabetic patients. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to determine the effects of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, hs-CRP, and oxidative stress in diabetic patients. METHODS: This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed on 54 diabetic patients aged 35-70 years. Subjects were randomly assigned to take either a multispecies probiotic supplement (n = 27) or placebo (n = 27) for 8 weeks. The multispecies probiotic supplement consisted of 7 viable and freeze-dried strains: Lactobacillus acidophilus (2 x 10(9) CFU), L. casei (7 x 10(9) CFU), L. rhamnosus (1.5 x 10(9) CFU), L. bulgaricus (2 x 10(8) CFU), Bifidobacterium breve (2 x 10(10) CFU), B. longum (7 x 10(9) CFU), Streptococcus thermophilus (1.5 x 10(9) CFU), and 100 mg fructo-oligosaccharide. Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after intervention to measure metabolic profiles, hs-CRP, and biomarkers of oxidative stress including plasma total antioxidant capacity and total glutathione (GSH). RESULTS: Between-group comparisons of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) revealed that consumption of probiotic supplements prevented a rise in FPG (+28.8 +/- 8.5 for placebo vs. +1.6 +/- 6 mg/dl for probiotic group, p = 0.01). Although a significant within-group increase in serum insulin and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels was found in both the probiotic group and the placebo group, the changes were similar between the two groups. We observed a significant increase in HOMA-IR (homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance) in both the probiotic group (p = 0.02) and the placebo group (p = 0.001); however, the increase in the placebo group was significantly higher than that in the probiotic group (+2.38 vs. +0.78, p = 0.03). Mean changes in serum hs-CRP were significantly different between the two groups (-777.57 for the probiotic group vs. +878.72 ng/ml for the placebo group, p = 0.02). Probiotic supplementation led to a significant increase in plasma GSH levels compared to placebo (240.63 vs. -33.46 micromol/l, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, multispecies probiotic supplementation, compared with placebo, for 8 weeks in diabetic patients prevented a rise in FPG and resulted in a decrease in serum hs-CRP and an increase in plasma total GSH.
TI  - Probiotic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from Tibetan kefir grains.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the functional properties of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from Tibetan kefir grains. Three Lactobacillus isolates identified as Lactobacillus acidophilus LA15, Lactobacillus plantarum B23 and Lactobacillus kefiri D17 that showed resistance to acid and bile salts were selected for further evaluation of their probiotic properties. The 3 selected strains expressed high in vitro adherence to Caco-2 cells. They were sensitive to gentamicin, erythromycin and chloramphenicol and resistant to vancomycin with MIC values of 26 microg/ml. All 3 strains showed potential bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity, cholesterol assimilation and cholesterol co-precipitation ability. Additionally, the potential effect of these strains on plasma cholesterol levels was evaluated in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Rats in 4 treatment groups were fed the following experimental diets for 4 weeks: a high-cholesterol diet, a high-cholesterol diet plus LA15, a high-cholesterol diet plus B23 or a high-cholesterol diet plus D17. The total cholesterol, triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in the serum were significantly (P<0.05) decreased in the LAB-treated rats compared with rats fed a high-cholesterol diet without LAB supplementation. The high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in groups B23 and D17 were significantly (P<0.05) higher than those in the control and LA15 groups. Additionally, both fecal cholesterol and bile acid levels were significantly (P<0.05) increased after LAB administration. Fecal lactobacilli counts were significantly (P<0.05) higher in the LAB treatment groups than in the control groups. Furthermore, the 3 strains were detected in the rat small intestine, colon and feces during the feeding trial. The bacteria levels remained high even after the LAB administration had been stopped for 2 weeks. These results suggest that these strains may be used in the future as probiotic starter cultures for manufacturing novel fermented foods.
TI  - Spermicidal and anti-Trichomonas vaginalis activity of Brazilian Sapindus saponaria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sapindus saponaria is used traditionally for curing ulcers, external  wounds and inflammations. The spermicidal and anti-Trichomonas activity of S. saponaria and its effect on Lactobacillus acidophilus were evaluated. METHODS: Water-ethanol (WE) and butanolic (BE) extracts, as well as a purified sample of saponins (SP) from S. saponaria were tested for spermicidal and anti-Trichomonas activity and for their effect on L. acidophilus. RESULTS: WE, BE and SP immobilized spermatozoa at a minimum effective concentration (MEC) of 2.5 (gram %) for extracts and 1.25 (gram %) for SP. The effective concentrations that caused 50% immobilization of spermatozoa (EC(5)(0)) were 0.5 (gram %) for WE and SP, and 0.1 (gram %) for BE. The compounds were effective against Trichomonas vaginalis (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration = 0.156 mg/mL for WE and BE, and 0.078 mg/mL for SP against a clinical strain (CS); and 0.312, 0.156 and 0.078 mg/mL for WE, BE and SP, respectively, against an ATCC strain). In all concentrations tested, the growth of L. acidophilus was not reduced. CONCLUSION: The in vitro study proved the spermicidal and anti-Trichomonas activity of S. saponaria. Complementary in vivo studies should be made for establish the use as a vaginal spermicide, particularly in Brazil and Latin America.
TI  - [Outcomes of Clostridium difficile enterocolitis after administration of antibiotics along with probiotic supplement].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Clostridium difficile enterocolitis is a potentially fatal disease  showing increasing incidence in hospital environment. Therapeutic approach in the management of Clostridium difficile enterocolitis is highly complex, particularly because of its tendency to relapse and reinfection. The study was aimed at investigating the factors influencing the development of Clostridium difficile enterocolitis and outcomes of enterocolitis after administration of standard antimicrobial therapy combined with probiotic supplement. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A non-comparative prospective observational study encompassed 42 patients (22 males and 20 females) diagnosed with Clostridium difficile enterocolitis and treated at the Department of Infectious Diseases in Novi Sad in the period October 2011 - April 2012. RESULTS: Higher incidence of the disease was found in elderly patients (78.6% of them were over 60 years of age), after antimicrobial therapy (83.8%), after hospitalization (83.3%) and in comorbid conditions (85.7%). The clinical picture revealed predominantly mild to moderate symptoms. A good clinical response to the standard antimicrobial therapy (metronidazole, vancomycin) combined with probiotic given for 10 days was observed in all patients, and the improvement in parameters such as the number and appearance of stools, abdominal distension and pain was recorded. Statistically significant changes in laboratory parameters (leukocyte count, C-reactive protein level) were recorded on day 5 after the onset of disease. Recurrent infection after successful therapy was observed in 9.5% of the patients. CONCLUSION: Administration of probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus Rosell-52, Lactobacillus rhamnosus Rosell-11 and Bifidobacterium longum Rosell-175 alongside the standard antimicrobial therapy in the patients with Clostridium difficile enterocolitis demonstrated positive effects on the severity or clinical picture and normalization of laboratory parameters. Recurrent infection after successful therapy was observed in only a small number of patients as compared with the literature data.
TI  - Acne vulgaris, probiotics and the gut-brain-skin axis: from anecdote to translational medicine.
AB  - Acne vulgaris has long been postulated to feature a gastrointestinal mechanism, dating back 80 years to dermatologists John H. Stokes and Donald M. Pillsbury. They hypothesised that emotional states (e.g. depression and anxiety) could alter normal intestinal microbiota, increase intestinal permeability, and contribute to systemic inflammation. They were also among the first to propose the use of probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus cultures. In recent years, aspects of this gut-brain-skin theory have been further validated via modern scientific investigations. It is evident that gut microbes and oral probiotics could be linked to the skin, and particularly acne severity, by their ability to influence systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, glycaemic control, tissue lipid content, and even mood. This intricate relationship between gut microbiota and the skin may also be influenced by diet, a current area of intense scrutiny by those who study acne. Here we provide a historical background to the gut-brain-skin theory in acne, followed by a summary of contemporary investigations and clinical implications.
TI  - A functional glycogen biosynthesis pathway in Lactobacillus acidophilus: expression and analysis of the glg operon.
AB  - Glycogen metabolism contributes to energy storage and various physiological functions in some prokaryotes, including colonization persistence. A role for glycogen metabolism is proposed on the survival and fitness of Lactobacillus acidophilus, a probiotic microbe, in the human gastrointestinal environment. L. acidophilus NCFM possesses a glycogen metabolism (glg) operon consisting of glgBCDAP-amy-pgm genes. Expression of the glg operon and glycogen accumulation were carbon source- and growth phase-dependent, and were repressed by glucose. The highest intracellular glycogen content was observed in early log-phase cells grown on trehalose, which was followed by a drastic decrease of glycogen content prior to entering stationary phase. In raffinose-grown cells, however, glycogen accumulation gradually declined following early log phase and was maintained at stable levels throughout stationary phase. Raffinose also induced an overall higher temporal glg expression throughout growth compared with trehalose. Isogenic DeltaglgA (glycogen synthase) and DeltaglgB (glycogen-branching enzyme) mutants are glycogen-deficient and exhibited growth defects on raffinose. The latter observation suggests a reciprocal relationship between glycogen synthesis and raffinose metabolism. Deletion of glgB or glgP (glycogen phosphorylase) resulted in defective growth and increased bile sensitivity. The data indicate that glycogen metabolism is involved in growth maintenance, bile tolerance and complex carbohydrate utilization in L. acidophilus.
TI  - Impact of 6 different intestinal bacteria on broiler breeder sperm motility in vitro.
AB  - Male fertility is often evaluated by measuring sperm parameters, including concentration, viability, and motility. This is important because after copulation occurs, sperm must overcome many barriers in the female reproductive tract to fertilize the ovum. In mammalian species, sperm have been shown to have reduced motility when bacteria are present. In male broiler breeders, bacteria have been associated with spermatozoa, but their effect on motility has not been investigated. The sperm quality index is a modern rapid method of evaluating avian sperm motility. Therefore, the objective of this study was to use the sperm quality index to determine if broiler breeder sperm motility is reduced when semen is exposed to various bacteria. In this experiment, semen was collected from 20 broiler breeders to obtain a pooled neat semen sample. Six different intestinal bacteria, Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium bifermentans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium animalis were cultured overnight. For each bacterium, 50 microL of semen was diluted in 450 microL of saline, sterile broth, or the overnight culture, creating 3 treatments. The experiment was repeated twice. In each treatment, 3 replicates were evaluated at 0 and 10 min postinoculation, creating a completely randomized design with a split plot over time. Also, the pH was measured for each treatment at 0 and 10 min. The results indicated that all broths containing bacteria immediately reduced broiler breeder sperm motility when compared with the controls (P < 0.0001), but broths containing Bifidobacterium or Lactobacillus virtually made sperm immotile. Although broth containing Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Bifidobacterium immediately reduced sperm motility, the reduction did not change over time. Broths containing E. coli, Clostridium, and Lactobacillus reduced sperm motility immediately, but over time motility continued to decrease. However, pH was increased when semen was exposed to the E. coli and Campylobacter treatment, but when semen was exposed to Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus treatments, pH was reduced. In conclusion, the results indicate that bacteria can reduce broiler breeder sperm motility upon exposure.
TI  - The effect of Lacto- and Bifidobacteria in monoculture on the vaginal microflora  in norm and in cases of intravaginal staphylococcosis.
AB  - The influence of probiotic strains of Lactobacillus casei IMV B-7280, Lactobacillus acidophilus IMV B-7279, Bifidobacterium animalis VKL, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus IMV B-7281 and Bifidobacterium animalis VKB, each strain separately, to the range of the urogenital tract microflora in physiological norm and in cases of experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis of mice induced by Staphylococcus aureus 8325-4. It was found that all these strains had different efficiency in Staphylococcus aureus 8325-4 growth suppression in the vagina of infected mice and affect the spectrum of microorganisms. Lactobacillus casei IMV B-7280 strain had effective antistaphylococcal effect and reduced the number of coliform bacteria and fungi in the vagina in cases of intravaginal staphylococcosis of mice. Lactobacillus casei IMV B-7280 strain is promising to create probiotic drugs effective in treating intravaginal staphylococcosis.
TI  - Changes in satiety hormone concentrations and feed intake in rats in response to  lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - A negative energy balance can be accomplished by reducing the caloric intake which results in an increased feeling of hunger. This physiological state is regulated by secretion of satiety hormones. The secretion of these hormones can be influenced by ingestion of e.g. fat. Fat, dairy beverage and synbiotic mixture have been found to have satiety-inducing effects in humans and rats. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the change of satiety hormone concentration in rats in response to feeding of fermented milks containing lactic acid bacteria. Two studies were conducted with Wistar rats randomly allocated into groups receiving Lactobacillus fermented (2 L. acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. salivarius and L. rhamnosus) milk. A single isocaloric oral dose with the test item or control was given to the rats. Blood samples were taken after dosing with the test product and the satiety hormones were measured. For the test groups, significant changes could be detected in PYY concentrations after 60 min, although some groups had a significant lower feed intake. In conclusion, some probiotic Lactobacillus strains may modify satiety hormones production. However, more studies are needed to evaluate their potential of prolonging satiety.
TI  - Diversity in proteinase specificity of thermophilic lactobacilli as revealed by hydrolysis of dairy and vegetable proteins.
AB  - Ability of industrially relevant species of thermophilic lactobacilli strains to  hydrolyze proteins from animal (caseins and beta-lactoglobulin) and vegetable (soybean and wheat) sources, as well as influence of peptide content of growth medium on cell envelope-associated proteinase (CEP) activity, was evaluated. Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis (CRL 581 and 654), L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (CRL 454 and 656), Lactobacillus acidophilus (CRL 636 and 1063), and Lactobacillus helveticus (CRL 1062 and 1177) were grown in a chemically defined medium supplemented or not with 1 % Casitone. All strains hydrolyzed mainly beta-casein, while degradation of alphas-caseins was strain dependent. Contrariwise, kappa-Casein was poorly degraded by the studied lactobacilli. beta-Lactoglobulin was mainly hydrolyzed by CRL 656, CRL 636, and CRL 1062 strains. The L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis strains, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CRL 656, and L. helveticus CRL 1177 degraded gliadins in high extent, while the L. acidophilus and L. helveticus strains highly hydrolyzed soy proteins. Proteinase production was inhibited by Casitone, the most affected being the L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis species. This study highlights the importance of proteolytic diversity of lactobacilli for rational strain selection when formulating hydrolyzed dairy or vegetable food products.
TI  - Effect of multispecies probiotics on irritable bowel syndrome: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: The efficacy of treatment with multispecies probiotics on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms and the alterations of gut microbiota in patients who have taken probiotics were investigated. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involved 49 IBS patients (probiotics: 25, placebo: 24) diagnosed according to the Rome III criteria. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups: either to receive multispecies probiotics (a mixture of Bifidobacterium longum, B. bifidum, B. lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, and Streptococcus thermophilus) twice a day for 4 weeks or to receive a placebo twice a day for 4 weeks. The primary efficacy end-point was the proportion of participants whose IBS symptoms were substantially relieved at week 4. Secondary end-points were the intensity of abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating, stool frequency/consistency, alterations in fecal microflora over the 4 weeks. Fecal microflora were analyzed in 34 patients (probiotics: 17, placebo: 17) by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays. RESULTS: The proportion of patients whose IBS symptoms were substantially relieved at week 4 was significantly higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo group: 68.0% (17/25) versus 37.5% (9/24) (P < 0.05). Secondary end-points such as improvement in abdominal pain/discomfort and bloating occurred in the probiotics group but not in the placebo group. Fecal analysis revealed that B. lactis, L. rhamnosus, and S. thermophilus had increased significantly in the probiotics group after 4 weeks and that B. lactis had increased in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Multispecies probiotics are effective in IBS patients and induce the alterations in the composition of intestinal microbiota.
TI  - Lab-Test((R)) 4: Dental caries and bacteriological analysis.
AB  - Dental caries is one of the most common infectious ultifactorial diseases worldwide, characterized by the progressive demineralization of the tooth, following the action of bacterial acid metabolism. The main factors predisposing the onset of the carious process are: 1) the presence of bacterial species able to lower the pH until critical values of 5.5, 2) the absence of adequate oral hygiene, 3) an inefficient immune response anti-caries, 4) the type of alimentary diet and 5) the structure of the teeth. Among the 200 bacterial species isolated from dental plaque the most pathogenic for dental caries are: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Actinomices viscusus and Bifidobacterium dentium. Our laboratory (LAB((R)) s.r.l., Codigoro, Ferrara, Italy) has developed a test for absolute and relative quantification of the most common oral cariogenic bacteria. The test uses specific primers and probes for the amplification of bacteria genome sequences in Polymerase Chain Reaction Real Time. The results provide a profile of patient infection, helpful for improving the diagnosis and planning of preventive treatment to reduce the bacterial load.
TI  - ESR spin trapping for characterization of radical formation in Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and Listeria innocua.
AB  - In this study, radicals in pure cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and Listeria innocua were detected in a quantitative way by electron spin resonance spectroscopy using spin trapping with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) or N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone (PBN). No adverse effect of spin trap addition on viability was observed for any of the bacterial strains. L. acidophilus NCFM had a higher production of radicals than L. innocua when incubated in a growth medium. Furthermore, by using DMPO in a buffer system, the radicals produced by L. acidophilus NCFM could be identified as hydroxyl radicals. The presence of polyethylene glycol, impermeable for bacterial cells, decreased the signal intensity of the ESR spectrum of the DMPO-OH adduct in cultures of L. acidophilus NCFM and indicated quenching of hydroxyl radicals outside the bacteria. This suggests that radical production is an extracellular event for L. acidophilus NCFM.
TI  - The influence of sweeteners in probiotic Petit Suisse cheese in concentrations equivalent to that of sucrose.
AB  - As in the case of probiotic functional foods in recent years, demand has increased notably for light or diet foods with added sweeteners. However, little is known about the effect of different sweeteners on the microorganisms present. Thus, the objective of the current study was to establish the ideal sucrose concentration and equivalent concentrations of different sweeteners and to determine, by microbiological analyses, the influence of these compounds on the viability of the starter and probiotic cultures used in the production of strawberry-flavored Petit Suisse cheese during its shelf life. The ideal sucrose concentration was determined using the just-about-right (JAR) scale, and the equivalent concentrations of the sweeteners were subsequently determined by the magnitude estimation method. Microbiological analyses were also carried out to check the viability of the cultures during the product's shelf life. The results showed that the compounds Neotame (NutraSweet, Chicago, IL) and stevia presented, respectively, the greatest and least sweetening power of the sweeteners tested. None of the sweeteners used in this study exerted a negative effect on the viability of the starter or probiotic cultures, and thus we were able to obtain a probiotic, functional food with reduced calorie content.
TI  - A double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial on probiotics in small bowel bacterial overgrowth in children treated with omeprazole.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incidence of small bowel bacterial overgrowth (SBBO) in children treated with omeprazole, and to test whether probiotics influence the incidence. METHODS: A double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was performed in 70 children treated orally during four weeks with 20mg omeprazole per day. Lactobacillus rhamnosus R0011 (1.9x10(9) cfu) and Lactobacillus acidophilus R0052 (0.1x10(9) cfu) were simultaneously given daily to 36 subjects (probiotic group), while 34 subjects received placebo (placebo group). The diagnosis of SBBO was based on the development of suggestive symptoms, in combination with a positive glucose breath test. RESULTS: After one month of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment, 30% (21/70) had a positive breath test suggesting SBBO; of these 62% were symptomatic. Five children developed SBBO-like symptoms, but had a negative breath test; and 44 (63%) were symptom free and had a negative breath test. There was no difference in the incidence of positive breath tests in the probiotic versus the placebo group (33% vs 26.5%; p=0.13). CONCLUSIONS: Since symptoms suggesting SBBO developed in 26% of PPI-treated children, and since the glucose breath test was abnormal in 72% of these, this side-effect should be more frequently considered. The probiotic tested did not decrease the risk to develop SBBO.
TI  - Photodynamic antimicrobial therapy of curcumin in biofilms and carious dentine.
AB  - Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a technique that involves the activation of photosensitizers by light in the presence of oxygen, resulting in the production of reactive radicals that are capable of inducing cell death. The present study evaluated the susceptibility of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus to PDT grown as multi-species in the biofilm phase versus in dentine carious lesions. A brain-heart infusion culture medium supplemented with 1% glucose, 2% sucrose, and 1% young primary culture of L. acidophilus 10(8) CFU/mL and S. mutans 10(8) CFU/mL was used to develop multi-species biofilms and to induce caries on human dentine slabs. Five different concentrations of curcumin (0.75, 1.5, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 g/L) were used associated with 5.7 J/cm(2) light emission diode. Four different groups were analyzed L-D- (control group), L-D+ (drug group), L+D- (light group), and L+D+ (PDT group). ANOVA/Tukey's tests were conducted to compare groups. A significant reduction (p <0.05) in cell viability was observed in the biofilm phase following photosensitization with all curcumin concentrations tested. To achieve significant bacterial reduction (p <0.05) in carious dentine, it was necessary to utilize 5.0 g/L of curcumin in association with blue light. No significant reduction was found for L-D+, supporting the absence of the drug's dark toxicity. S. mutans and L. acidophilus were susceptible to curcumin in the presence of blue light. However, due to light penetration and drug diffusion difficulties, these microorganisms within dentine carious lesions were less affected than they were in the biofilm phase.
TI  - Complete Genome Sequence of Probiotic Strain Lactobacillus acidophilus La-14.
AB  - We present the 1,991,830-bp complete genome sequence of Lactobacillus acidophilus strain La-14 (SD-5212). Comparative genomic analysis revealed 99.98% similarity overall to the L. acidophilus NCFM genome. Globally, 111 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (95 SNPs, 16 indels) were observed throughout the genome. Also, a 416-bp deletion in the LA14_1146 sugar ABC transporter was identified.
TI  - Daily consumption of a synbiotic yogurt decreases energy intake but does not improve gastrointestinal transit time: a double-blind, randomized, crossover study in healthy adults.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Probiotic and synbiotic products are widely marketed to healthy individuals, although potential benefits for these individuals are rarely studied. This study investigated the effect of daily consumption of a synbiotic yogurt on gastrointestinal (GI) function in a sample of healthy adults. SUBJECTS/METHODS: In a randomized crossover double-blind study, 65 healthy adults consumed 200 g/day of yogurt with (synbiotic) or without (control) added probiotics (Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12, Lactobacillus acidophilus La5, Lactobacillus casei CRL431) and 4 g inulin for two 15-day treatment periods, each preceded by a 6-week washout period. GI transit time (GTT), duration of colour (DOC), GI symptoms and dietary intake were assessed and analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA, including PRE-treatment GTT as a covariate. Participants were grouped as short GTT (STT, n = 50, </=32.7 h) or long GTT (LTT, n = 15, >32.7 h) based on their PRE-treatment GTT assessment. RESULTS: POST-treatment GTT and DOC were not different between synbiotic and control, and did not change from PRE-treatment, within the STT or LTT groups. There were no changes in GI symptom ratings, indicating that both yogurts were well tolerated. In STT, energy, fat and protein intakes were decreased from baseline with synbiotic (p = 0.055, p = 0.059 and p = 0.005, respectively) and dietary fibre intake was higher POST-treatment with synbiotic versus control (p = 0.0002). In LTT, decreases in energy and fat intakes with synbiotic were not significant (p = 0.14 and p = 0.18, respectively) and there were no differences in dietary fibre intake. CONCLUSION: Consuming 200 g/day of synbiotic yogurt did not significantly alter GTT in healthy adults, but was well tolerated and helped to reduce overall energy intake.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of Enterococcus strains used in clinical practice as probiotics.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial susceptibilities of probiotic strains that are suggested to be effective for preventing antibiotics-associated diarrhea (AAD). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 17 antibiotics against probiotic strains were tested by the agar plate dilution method or broth microdilution method. In all, eight probiotic strains containing Enterococcus faecalis, Bifidobacterium spp., Clostridium butyricum, and Lactobacillus acidophilus were tested. Although the MIC range was wide, from less than 0.0625 to more than 1,024 mug/ml, the MICs of 11 beta-lactams were high for three of four enterococci, with a range of 32 to more than 1,024 mug/ml. In contrast, fluoroquinolones and vancomycin showed potent activities against all enterococci, of which MICs were 0.25-8 mug/ml. Two Bifidobacterium strains and one Lactobacillus strain showed low MICs against many of the beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, and vancomycin, with MICs of 8 mug/ml or less. Fosfomycin showed generally mild activity against enterococci (MIC, 8-32 mug/ml) and anaerobic strains (MIC, 32 to >1,024 mug/ml), respectively. The probiotics strains with high MIC values may survive in the intestinal tract, even if the patient was concomitantly using the antibiotics in clinical practice. Therefore, our results suggest that adequate combinations of probiotics strains and antibiotics should be important for preventing AAD. Further study is needed to determine the efficacy of probiotics in clinical practice.
TI  - Structure and anti-inflammatory capacity of peptidoglycan from Lactobacillus acidophilus in RAW-264.7 cells.
AB  - Probiotic bacteria, especially the Lactobacillus species, can potentially play a  significant role in the antiviral and antimicrobial activity of a host's immune system. Lactobacillus acidophilus, an intestinal bacterium, is involved in the intestinal epithelial cell response when a pathogen adheres to a cell. In this study, the structure of peptidoglycan (PGN) isolated from L. acidophilus was determined with the help of HPLC, NMR, FT-IR and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. The molecular mass of PGN is 875.260 Da. The anti-inflammatory capacity of PGN was evaluated in model RAW 264.7 cells. Epifluorescence microscopy images and western blot analysis provided compelling evidence of PGN's anti-inflammatory capacity on LPS-induced macrophages. A significant decrease in inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) levels when PGN was added up to 200 mug/ml. These data provide new insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which probiotic bacteria can contribute to maintaining good health.
TI  - Effect of Aloe vera juice on growth and activities of Lactobacilli in-vitro.
AB  - In present investigation, different concentrations of Aloe vera juice incorporated into the growth media of Lactobacilli were tested to observe the effect on growth and activities of these bacteria. From the results obtained, it was observed that aloe vera juice at a concentration of 5% v/v was effective in promoting the growth of L. acidophilus, L. plantarum and L. casei, as evident from the fall in pH and increased acidity, as well as from the improved generation time. At 15 to 25% concentration, growth was unaffected as compared to the controls; however, concentration higher than 25%v/v discouraged the growth. Overall, it was concluded that Aloe vera juice or gel at a particular concentration could possibly be used in combination with probiotic Lactobacillus strain(s) as a combinational therapy for gastrointestinal disorders and cardiovascular diseases.
TI  - Helicobacter pylori VacA suppresses Lactobacillus acidophilus-induced interferon  beta signaling in macrophages via alterations in the endocytic pathway.
AB  - Helicobacter pylori causes chronic gastritis and avoids elimination by the immune system of the infected host. The commensal bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus has been suggested to exert beneficial effects as a supplement during H. pylori eradication therapy. In the present study, we applied whole-genome microarray analysis to compare the immune responses induced in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) stimulated with L. acidophilus, H. pylori, or both bacteria in combination. While L. acidophilus induced a Th1-polarizing response characterized by high expression of interferon beta (IFN-beta) and interleukin 12 (IL-12), H. pylori strongly induced the innate cytokines IL-1beta and IL-1alpha. In BMDMs prestimulated with L. acidophilus, H. pylori blocked the expression of L. acidophilus-induced IFN-beta and IL-12 and suppressed the expression of key regulators of the Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 GTPases. The inhibition of L. acidophilus-induced IFN-beta was independent of H. pylori viability and the virulence factor CagPAI; however, a vacuolating cytotoxin (vacA) mutant was unable to block IFN-beta. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that the addition of H. pylori to L. acidophilus-stimulated BMDMs redirects intracellular processing, leading to an accumulation of L. acidophilus in the endosomal and lysosomal compartments. Thus, our findings indicate that H. pylori inhibits the development of a strong Th1-polarizing response in BMDMs stimulated with L. acidophilus by blocking the production of IFN-beta in a VacA-dependent manner. We suggest that this abrogation is caused by a redirection of the endocytotic pathway in the processing of L. acidophilus. IMPORTANCE Approximately half of the world's population is infected with Helicobacter pylori. The factors that allow this pathogen to persist in the stomach and cause chronic infections have not yet been fully elucidated. In particular, how H. pylori avoids killing by macrophages, one of the main types of immune cell underlying the epithelium, remains elusive. Here we have shown that the H. pylori virulence factor VacA plays a key role by blocking the activation of innate cytokines induced by the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus in macrophages and suppresses the expression of key regulators required for the organization and dynamics of the intracellular cytoskeleton. Our results identify potential targets for the treatment of H. pylori infection and vaccination, since specific inhibition of the toxin VacA possibly allows the activation of an efficient immune response and thereby eradication of H. pylori in the host.
TI  - Effects of Agave tequilana fructans with different degree of polymerization profiles on the body weight, blood lipids and count of fecal Lactobacilli/Bifidobacteria in obese mice.
AB  - Fructans are dietary fibers with beneficial effects on the gastrointestinal physiology and offer a promising approach for the treatment of some metabolic disorders associated with obesity. In vitro and in vivo studies were developed to test the safety of fructans obtained from Agave tequilana Weber var. azul. Additionally, an in vivo experiment using a diet-induced obesity model was performed to compare the effect of agave fructans with different degree of polymerization (DP) profiles: agave fructans with DP > 10 (LcF), agave FOS with DP < 10 (ScF), and agave fructans with and without demineralization (dTF, TF) versus commercial chicory fructans (OraftiSynergy1) on the body weight change, fat, total cholesterol, triglycerides and count of fecal Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. Results showed that A. tequilana fructans were not mutagenic and were safe even at a dose of 5 g per kg b.w. Obese mice that received ScF showed a significant decrease in body weight gain, fat tissue and total cholesterol without increasing the count of fecal Bifidobacteria. Whereas, obese mice that received LcF and TF showed decreased triglycerides and an increased count of fecal Bifidobacteria. Interestingly, although obese mice that received dTF did not show changes in body weight gain, fat tissue, total cholesterol or triglycerides, they showed an increase in the count of Bifidobacteria. These results demonstrate that both the degree of polymerization and the demineralization process can influence the biological activity of agave fructans.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 1014 improved "gut health" in the SHIME reactor.
AB  - BACKGROUND: How to maintain "gut health" is a goal for scientists throughout the  world. Therefore, microbiota management models for testing probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics have been developed. METHODS: The SHIME model was used to study the effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus 1014 on the fermentation pattern of the colon microbiota. Initially, an inoculum prepared from human feces was introduced into the reactor vessels and stabilized over 2-wk using a culture medium. This stabilization period was followed by a 2-wk control period during which the microbiota was monitored. The microbiota was then subjected to a 4-wk treatment period by adding 5 mL of sterile peptone water with L. acidophilus CRL1014 at the concentration of 10(8) CFU/mL to vessel one (the stomach compartment). Plate counts, Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE), short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) and ammonium analyses were carried out for monitoring of the microbial community from the colon compartments. RESULTS: A significant increase (p < 0.01) in the Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. populations was observed during the treatment period. The DGGE obtained showed changes in the lactobacilli community from the colon compartments of the SHIME reactor. The (SCFA) concentration increased (p < 0.01) during the treatment period, due mainly to significant increased levels of acetic, butyric, and propionic acids. However, ammonium concentrations decreased during the same period (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed the beneficial influence of L. acidophilus CRL 1014 on microbial metabolism and lactobacilli community composition for improving human health.
TI  - Strain-specific detection of orally administered canine jejunum-dominated Lactobacillus acidophilus LAB20 in dog faeces by real-time PCR targeted to the novel surface layer protein.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus LAB20 has potential to be a probiotic strain because it can be present at high numbers in the jejunum of dog. To specifically detect LAB20 from dog faecal samples, a real-time PCR protocol was developed targeting the novel surface (S) layer protein gene of LAB20. The presence of S-layer protein was verified by N-terminal sequencing of the approximately 50-kDa major band from SDS-PAGE gel. The corresponding S-layer gene was amplified by inverse PCR using homology to known S-layers and sequenced. This novel S-layer protein has low sequence similarity to other S-layer proteins in the N-terminal region (32-211 aa, 7-39%). This enabled designing strain-specific PCR primers. The primer set was utilized to study intestinal persistence of LAB20 in dog that was fed with LAB20 fermented milk for 5 days. The results showed that LAB20 can be detected from dog faecal sample after 6 weeks with 10(4.53) DNA copies g(-1) postadministration. It suggested that LAB20 could be a good candidate to study the mechanism behind its persistence and dominance in dog intestine and maybe utilize it as a probiotic for canine. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: A real-time PCR method was developed to detect Lactobacillus acidophilus LAB20, a strain that was previously found dominant in canine gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The quantitative detection was based on targeting to variation region of a novel S-layer protein found in LAB20, allowing to specifically enumerate LAB20 from dog faeces. The results showed that the real-time PCR method was sensitive enough to be used in later intervention studies. Interestingly, LAB20 was found to persist in dog GI tract for 6 weeks. Therefore, LAB20 could be a good candidate to study its colonization and potentially utilize as a canine probiotic.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 attenuates the atherosclerotic progression through modulation of oxidative stress and inflammatory process.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Lactobacillus (L.) acidophilus ATCC 4356 on the progression of atherosclerosis in Apoliprotein-E knockout (ApoE(-/-)) mice and the underlying mechanisms. Eight week-old ApoE(-/-) mice were treated with L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 daily for 12 weeks. The wild type (WT) mice or ApoE(-/-) mice in the vehicle group were treated with saline only. Body weights, serum lipid levels, aortic atherosclerotic lesions, and tissue oxidative and inflammatory statuses were examined among the groups. As compared to ApoE(-/-) mice in the vehicle group, ApoE(-/-) mice treated with L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 had no changes in body weights and serum lipid profiles, but showed decreased atherosclerotic lesion size in en face aorta. In comparison with WT mice, ApoE(-/-) mice in the vehicle group showed higher levels of serum malondialdehyde (MDA), oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), but lower levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in serum. Administration of L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 could reverse these trends in a dose-dependent manner in ApoE(-/-) mice. Furthermore, ApoE(-/-) mice treated with L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 showed an inhibition of translocation of NF-kappaB p65 from cytoplasm to nucleus, suppression of degradation of aortic IkappaB-alpha, and improvements of gut microbiota distribution, as compared to ApoE(-/-) mice in the vehicle group. Our findings suggest that administration of L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 can attenuate the development of atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE(-/-) mice through reducing oxidative stress and inflammatory response.
TI  - Caries arresting effect of silver diamine fluoride on dentine carious lesion with S. mutans and L. acidophilus dual-species cariogenic biofilm.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This in vitro study investigated the effects of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) on dentine carious lesion with cariogenic biofilm. STUDY DESIGN: Thirty human dentine blocks were inoculated with Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus dual-species biofilm to create carious lesion. They were equally divided into test and control group to receive topical application of SDF and water. After incubation anaerobically using micro-well plate at 37oC for 7 days, the biofilms were evaluated for kinetics, morphology and viability by colony forming units (CFU), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and confocal microscopy (CLSM), respectively. The carious lesion underwent crystal characteristics analysis, evaluation of the changes in chemical structure and density of collagen fibrils using x-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and immune-labeling. RESULTS: The log CFU of S. mutans and L. acidophilus in the test group was significantly lower than control group. SEM and CLSM showed confluent biofilm in control group, but not in test group. XRD showed the loss of crystallinity of dentine due to the dissolution of hydroxyapatite crystal structure in test group was less than control group. FTIR showed that log [Amide I: HPO42-] for test vs. control group was 0.31+/-0.10 vs. 0.57+/-0.13 (p<0.05). The gold-labeling density in test vs. control group was 8.54+/-2.44/microm2 vs. 12.91+/-4.24/microm2 (p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: SDF had antimicrobial activity against the cariogenic biofilms and reduced demineralization of dentine.
TI  - Synergistic protection of combined probiotic conditioned media against neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis-like intestinal injury.
AB  - Balance among the complex interactions of the gut microbial community is important for intestinal health. Probiotic bacteria can improve bacterial balance and have been used to treat gastrointestinal diseases. Neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a life-threatening inflammatory bowel disorder primarily affecting premature infants. NEC is associated with extensive inflammatory NF-kappaB signaling activation as well as intestinal barrier disruption. Clinical studies have shown that probiotic administration may protect against NEC, however there are safety concerns associated with the ingestion of large bacterial loads in preterm infants. Bacteria-free conditioned media (CM) from certain probiotic organisms have been shown to retain bioactivity including anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties without the risks of live organisms. We hypothesized that the CM from Lactobacillus acidophilus (La), Bifidobacterium infantis (Bi), and Lactobacillus plantarum (Lp), used separately or together would protect against NEC. A rodent model with intestinal injury similar to NEC was used to study the effect of CM from Lp, La/Bi, and La/Bi/Lp on the pathophysiology of NEC. All the CM suppressed NF-kappaB activation via preserved IkappaBalpha expression and this protected IkappaBalpha was associated with decreased liver activity of the proteasome, which is the degrading machinery for IkappaBalpha. These CM effects also caused decreases in intestinal production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha, a downstream target of the NF-kappaB pathway. Combined La/Bi and La/Bi/Lp CM in addition protected intestinal barrier function by maintaining tight junction protein ZO-1 levels and localization at the tight junction. Double combined La/Bi CM significantly reduced intestinal injury incidence from 43% to 28% and triple combined La/Bi/Lp CM further reduced intestinal injury incidence to 20%. Thus, this study demonstrates different protective mechanisms and synergistic bioactivity of the CM from different organisms in ameliorating NEC-like intestinal injury in an animal model.
TI  - The applications of polysaccharides from various mushroom wastes as prebiotics in different systems.
AB  - The bases or stipes of mushrooms are normally discarded as low-economic value animal feed and compost. There are no known reports on deriving polysaccharides from these mushroom wastes for use as prebiotics. This study showed that the relatively low concentration (0.1% to 0.5%) of polysaccharides from Lentinula edodes stipe, Pleurotus eryngii base, and Flammulina velutipes base can enhance the survival rate of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum during cold storage. The polysaccharides had synergistic effects with the peptides and amino acids from a yogurt culture to maintain probiotics above 10(7) CFU/mL during cold storage, and they also had significant protective effects on these probiotics in simulated gastric and bile juice conditions to achieve beneficial effects in the host. These results showed that mushroom wastes, which are cheaper than other sources, could be an important, new, alternative source of prebiotics.
TI  - Efficacy of polymer coating of probiotic beads suspended in pressurized and pasteurized longan juices on the exposure to simulated gastrointestinal environment.
AB  - Alginate-coated Lactobacillus acidophilus LA5 or Lactobacillus casei 01 was recoated with either 0.1-0.5% (w/v) alginate or 0.05-0.15% (w/v) poly-L-lysine (PLL) plus 0.2% (w/v) alginate or 5-15% (w/v) gelatin, after which they were determined for survivability in gastric or bile longan juices. The morphology of encapsulated probiotic cells illustrated that recoated beads with 0.5% alginate showed a more compact surface and a greater protective effect than other recoating materials. The recoated beads with 0.5% alginate and 0.05-0.15% PLL plus 0.2% alginate of both strains showed the highest viability in gastric longan juice. In bile longan juice, only 0.5% alginate showed the best protection for both recoated beads. When considering the storage stability, encapsulated L. acidophilus LA5 exhibited a higher viable count than those of the free cells, whereas L. casei 01 showed equivalent viability of both free and double-coated cells. Based on the impact of pressurization or pasteurization, both processed juices gave rise to equivalent survivability of the probiotic cells during storage.
TI  - [Illumina sequencing 16S rRNA tagging reveals diverse vaginal microbiomes associated with bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze and compare vaginal microbiomes in healthy women at child-bearing ages and patients with bacterial vaginosis (BV). METHODS: A total of 74 vaginal swabs of the vaginal fornix were collected from 37 BV patients and 37 healthy women. BV status was assessed according to Amsels clinical criteria for all the subjects and confirmed using Gram-stain criteria (Nugent scores). Genomic DNA of the samples was extracted for amplifying the 16S rRNA V6 hypervariable region by PCR and pyrosequencing by Illumina. BIPES, UCHIME, TSC and GAST were employed to analyze the information of the species from the samples. RESULTS: Lactobacillus was the predominant species in healthy women (more than 95%), including mainly L. iners and L. crispatus, with a small quantity of Gardnerella, Granulicatella, Streptococcus, Prevotella, Escherichia and other genus. The alpha diversity was significantly increased in 30 BV patients (P<0.001), and beta diversity also changed obviously shown by decreased Lactobacillus (varying from 45% to 1%, consisting mainly of L. iners) or even absence Lactobacillus in 6 cases, with increased relative abundance of Gardnerella, Prevotella, Granulicatella, Anaerococcus, Parvimonas, Peptoniphilus.harei, Peptostreptococcus, and Dialister. Different from previous data, 7 BV cases showed a predominance of the rare species L.gasseri and L.acidophilus (75% to 50%). CONCLUSION: Lactobacillus is the predominant vaginal species in healthy women (mainly L. iners and L. crispatus) co-existing with many other bacteria and a variety of microorganisms. Lactobacillus is significantly decreased and even absent in most of BV patients, and some cases show the predominance of the rare species L.gasseri and L.acidophilus.
TI  - Effect of immersion and inoculation in ovo of Lactobacillus spp. in embryonated chicken eggs in the prevention of Salmonella Enteritidis after hatch.
AB  - The protection level against Salmonella Enteritidis was evaluated in chickens after in ovo treatment with different species of Lactobacillus spp. inoculated into the air cell or by immersion in broth culture. Two hundred forty embryonated eggs were distributed into 8 groups, corresponding to treatments with Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus salivarius, and control. On d 18 of incubation, 4 groups were inoculated with 0.1 mL of inoculum in the air cell and 4 groups were immersed for 3 min in culture of each treatment. Two days after hatching, 0.5 mL of Salmonella Enteritidis culture was inoculated by the intraesophageal route. On d 5 of life, the chicks were euthanized and the ceca were processed to obtain Salmonella Enteritidis counts. There was no decrease in Salmonella Enteritidis colonization of chick ceca, regardless of treatment or route of administration. Lactobacillus spp. samples used in the treatment showed no probiotic potential in chicks when inoculated in ovo, in relation to Salmonella Enteritidis inhibition in poultry ceca.
TI  - Catabolic flexibility of mammalian-associated lactobacilli.
AB  - Metabolic flexibility may be generally defined as "the capacity for the organism  to adapt fuel oxidation to fuel availability". The metabolic diversification strategies used by individual bacteria vary greatly from the use of novel or acquired enzymes to the use of plasmid-localised genes and transporters. In this review, we describe the ability of lactobacilli to utilise a variety of carbon sources from their current or new environments in order to grow and survive. The genus Lactobacillus now includes more than 150 species, many with adaptive capabilities, broad metabolic capacity and species/strain variance. They are therefore, an informative example of a cell factory capable of adapting to new niches with differing nutritional landscapes. Indeed, lactobacilli naturally colonise and grow in a wide variety of environmental niches which include the roots and foliage of plants, silage, various fermented foods and beverages, the human vagina and the mammalian gastrointestinal tract (GIT; including the mouth, stomach, small intestine and large intestine). Here we primarily describe the metabolic flexibility of some lactobacilli isolated from the mammalian gastrointestinal tract, and we also describe some of the food-associated species with a proven ability to adapt to the GIT. As examples this review concentrates on the following species - Lb. plantarum, Lb. acidophilus, Lb. ruminis, Lb. salivarius, Lb. reuteri and Lb. sakei, to highlight the diversity and inter-relationships between the catabolic nature of species within the genus.
TI  - Capsicum annuum enhances L-lactate production by Lactobacillus acidophilus: implication in curd formation.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus is commonly used lactic acid bacteria for producing fermented milk products. In general household practice, curdling is known to occur faster in the presence of red chili. Herein we analyzed the enhanced effect of red chili (Capsicum annuum) and its major component, capsaicin, on Lactobacillus acidophilus (ATCC 4356) in the production of L-lactate in de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe medium at various temperatures (15, 20, 25, 30, and 37 degrees C). The addition of red chili showed significant increase in the amount of L-lactate produced by L. acidophilus compared with the control at all temperatures. Similar results were observed with addition of capsaicin alone. This was accompanied by an increase in the consumption of d-glucose. Capsazepine, a known antagonist of capsaicin, inhibited the production of L-lactate by L. acidophilus in the presence of both capsaicin and red chili. Because no increase occurred in the growth of L. acidophilus in the presence of red chili, the enhanced production of L-lactate in the presence of red chili or capsaicin is due to increased metabolic activity.
TI  - Suppression of TLR-4-related inflammatory pathway and anti-fibrosis effects of probiotic-fermented purple sweet potato yogurt in hearts of spontaneously hypertensive rats.
AB  - Inflammation plays an important role in triggering fibrosis of cardiovascular disease and hypertension. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) has hypotensive effect; GABA concentration could be enhanced in milk fermented with lactic acid bacteria (LAB). This study evaluated the effect of probiotic-fermented purple sweet potato yogurt (PSPY) on the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4)-related inflammatory components, and on fibrosis in the heart of spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). TLR4-related pathway and fibrosis-associated proteins TGFbeta and FGF2 were significantly increased in SHR hearts, but were highly suppressed in 10% PSPY-fed rats. Microscopic examination with Masson trichrome staining of left ventricle further demonstrated that 10% and 100% PSPY both significantly reduced interstitial fibrosis in SHR hearts. These findings indicated that oral administration of 10% probiotic-fermented PSPY was strong enough to lower cardiac fibrosis in SHR rats through the suppression of TLR-4-related inflammatory pathway. Therefore, PSPY may be included in diets to help prevent cardiac fibrosis in patients with hypertension.
TI  - Incorporation of soybean by-product okara and inulin in a probiotic soy yoghurt:  texture profile and sensory acceptance.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the effect of inulin and okara flour on textural and sensory properties of probiotic soy yoghurt (SY) throughout 28 days of storage at 4 degrees C. Employing a 2(2) design, four formulations of SY produced from soymilk and fermented with an ABT-4 culture (Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5, Bifidobacterium animalis Bb-12 and Streptococcus thermophilus) were studied: SY-C (control); SY-I (with inulin); SY-O (with okara); SY-IO (with inulin + okara). RESULTS: The addition of okara and the refrigerated storage led to significant differences in the instrumental texture parameters of SY (P < 0.05). Inulin and okara did not affect SY sensory acceptability (P > 0.05), but there was a tendency for higher scores in the presence of inulin. On the other hand, the storage period, particularly at 21 days, was unfavourable regarding the acceptance of the different SY. CONCLUSION: The results showed that the addition of okara flour and the storage were significant factors to increase firmness of the soy yoghurts. SY acceptability was not affected by the incorporation of inulin or okara. These results suggest that okara, discarded as industrial waste, may be used in probiotic soy yoghurt, helping to increase the nutritional and functional properties without altering its acceptability.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of the antimicrobial efficacy of four chewing sticks commonly used in South India: an in vitro study.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: The use of chewing sticks has been well documented since ancient times in India. Chewing sticks are a good alternative to the toothbrush for maintaining oral hygiene. The present study was designed and conducted to compare and evaluate the antimicrobial effects of the aqueous extracts of neem, miswak, mango, and banyan chewing sticks against two bacterial species considered the most important in the initiation and progression of dental caries, namely Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus, respectively. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twigs of the above mentioned chewing sticks were sun dried and powdered, and sterile aqueous solutions of 10%, 25% and 50% concentrations were prepared. Culture plates for S mutans and L acidophilus were prepared and the growth was transferred to nutrient agar and Mueller-Hinton agar; antimicrobial activity of the extracts was tested after 72 h, using the disc diffusion method. Normal saline was used as control. RESULTS: The antimicrobial activity of neem, miswak, and mango extracts increased as their concentrations increased. Both banyan extract and saline showed no antimicrobial activity against the organisms tested. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Based on the zones of inhibition, aqueous extracts of neem showed the most antimicrobial activity against S mutans, while miswak extracts showed superior antimicrobial activity against L acidophilus. We recommend further phytochemical and pharmacological studies to discover newer nonsynthetic tooth pastes and mouthwashes.
TI  - The protective effect of recombinant FomA-expressing Lactobacillus acidophilus against periodontal infection.
AB  - A number of studies have shown that the outer membrane protein FomA found in Fusobacterium nucleatum demonstrates great potential as an immune target for combating periodontitis. Lactobacillus acidophilus is a useful antigen delivery vehicle for mucosal immunisation, and previous studies by our group have shown that L. acidophilus acts as a protective factor in periodontal health. In this study, making use of the immunogenicity of FomA and the probiotic properties of L. acidophilus, we constructed a recombinant form of L. acidophilus expressing the FomA protein and detected the FomA-specific IgG in the serum and sIgA in the saliva of mice through oral administration with the recombinant strains. When serum containing FomA-specific antibodies was incubated with the F. nucleatum in vitro, the number of Porphyromonas gingivalis cells that coaggregated with the F. nucleatum cells was significantly reduced. Furthermore, a mouse gum abscess model was successfully generated, and the range of gingival abscesses in the immune mice was relatively limited compared with the control group. The level of IL-1beta in the serum and local gum tissues of the immune mice was consistently lower than in the control group. Our findings indicated that oral administration of the recombinant L. acidophilus reduced the risk of periodontal infection with P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum.
TI  - Beneficial role of the probiotic mixture Ultrabiotique on maintaining the integrity of intestinal mucosal barrier in DSS-induced experimental colitis.
AB  - The etiology of inflammatory bowel diseases which include ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease has not yet been clarified. Several hypotheses suggest a change in composition of gut microflora along with an impaired mucosal barrier that lead to excessive mucosal immunologic responses. Increased production of nitric oxide (NO) contributes greatly to the tissue injury caused by chronic inflammation. Evidence indicates that the mucus layer covering the epithelium is altered during UC and experimental colitis. Our aim in this study was to investigate the potential therapeutic effect of probiotic during DSS-induced colitis by modulating the immune system and colonic mucus production. For that purpose, the probiotic formulation Ultrabiotique((R)) (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum and Bifidobacterium breve) was administered daily for 7 d to mice with colitis. Probiotic supplementation improved clinical symptoms and histological alterations observed during DSS induced colitis. Ultrabiotique((R)) treatment down regulated the NO production by peritoneal macrophages of DSS-treated mice and enhanced mucus production in both DSS-treated and healthy mice. In conclusion, the modification of microflora by the Ultrabiotique((R)) played a beneficial role in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier and promoted tissue repair.
TI  - Lactobacillus species isolated from vaginal secretions of healthy and bacterial vaginosis-intermediate Mexican women: a prospective study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus jensenii, L. iners, L. crispatus and L. gasseri are the most frequently occurring lactobacilli in the vagina. However, the native species vary widely according to the studied population. The present study was performed to genetically determine the identity of Lactobacillus strains present in the vaginal discharge of healthy and bacterial vaginosis (BV) intermediate Mexican women. METHODS: In a prospective study, 31 strains preliminarily identified as Lactobacillus species were isolated from 21 samples collected from 105 non-pregnant Mexican women. The samples were classified into groups according to the Nugent score criteria proposed for detection of BV: normal (N), intermediate (I) and bacterial vaginosis (BV). We examined the isolates using culture-based methods as well as molecular analysis of the V1-V3 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) sequence analysis was performed to reject clones. RESULTS: Clinical isolates (25/31) were classified into four groups based on sequencing and analysis of the 16S rRNA gene: L. acidophilus (14/25), L. reuteri (6/25), L. casei (4/25) and L. buchneri (1/25). The remaining six isolates were presumptively identified as Enterococcus species. Within the L. acidophilus group, L. gasseri was the most frequently isolated species, followed by L. jensenii and L. crispatus. L. fermentum, L. rhamnosus and L. brevis were also isolated, and were placed in the L. reuteri, L. casei and L. buchneri groups, respectively. ERIC profile analysis showed intraspecific variability amongst the L. gasseri and L. fermentum species. CONCLUSIONS: These findings agree with previous studies showing that L. crispatus, L. gasseri and L. jensenii are consistently present in the healthy vaginal ecosystem. Additional species or phylotypes were detected in the vaginal microbiota of the non-pregnant Mexican (Hispanic-mestizo) population, and thus, these results further our understanding of vaginal lactobacilli colonisation and richness in this particular population.
TI  - Detection and quantification of probiotic strain Lactobacillus gasseri K7 in faecal samples by targeting bacteriocin genes.
AB  - Lactobacillus gasseri K7 is a probiotic strain that produces bacteriocins gassericin K7 A and K7 B. In order to develop a real-time quantitative PCR assay for the detection of L. gasseri K7, 18 reference strains of the Lactobacillus acidophilus group and 45 faecal samples of adults who have never consumed strain K7 were tested with PCR using 14 pairs of primers specific for gassericin K7 A and K7 B gene determinants. Incomplete gassericin K7 A or K7 B gene clusters were found to be dispersed in different lactobacilli strains as well as in faecal microbiota. One pair of primers was found to be specific for the total gene cluster of gassericin K7A and one for gassericin K7B. The real-time PCR analysis of faecal samples spiked with K7 strain revealed that primers specific for the gene cluster of the gassericin K7 A were more suitable for quantitative determination than those for gassericin K7 B, due to the lower detection level. Targeting of the gassericin K7 A or K7 B gene cluster with specific primers could be used for detection and quantification of L. gasseri K7 in human faecal samples without prior cultivation. The results of this study also present new insights into the prevalence of bacteriocin-encoding genes in gastrointestinal tract.
TI  - Comparison of adhesive gut bacteria composition, immunity, and disease resistance in juvenile hybrid tilapia fed two different Lactobacillus strains.
AB  - This study compares the effects of two Lactobacillus strains, highly adhesive Lactobacillus brevis JCM 1170 (HALB) and less-adhesive Lactobacillus acidophilus JCM 1132 (LALB), on the survival and growth, adhesive gut bacterial communities, immunity, and protection against pathogenic bacterial infection in juvenile hybrid tilapia. During a 5-week feeding trial the fish were fed a diet containing 0 to 10(9) cells/g feed of the two Lactobacillus strains. Samples of intestine, kidney, and spleen were taken at the start and at 10, 20, and 35 days for analysis of stress tolerance and cytokine gene mRNA levels and to assess the diversity of adhesive gut bacterial communities. A 14-day immersion challenge with Aeromonas hydrophila NJ-1 was also performed following the feeding trial. The results showed no significant differences in survival rate, weight gain, or feed conversion in the different dietary treatments. The adhesive gut bacterial communities were strikingly altered in the fish fed either the HALB or the LALB, but the response was more rapid and substantial with the adhesive strain. The two strains induced similar changes in the patterns (upregulation or downregulation) of intestinal, splenic or kidney cytokine expression, but they differed in the degree of response for these genes. Changes in intestinal HSP70 expression levels coincided with changes in the similarity coefficient of the adhesive gut bacterial communities between the probiotic treatments. The highest dose of the HALB appeared to protect against the toxic effects of immersion in A. hydrophila (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the degree to which Lactobacillus strains adhere to the gut may be a favorable criterion in selecting probiotic strain for aquaculture.
TI  - Effects of three-month intake of synbiotic on inflammation and body composition in the elderly: a pilot study.
AB  - We hypothesize that improvements in the gut microbiota are capable of ameliorating gut permeability and, consequently, reducing systemic inflammation and the risk of frailty. This study aims to evaluate some effects of synbiotic supplementation on inflammatory markers and the body composition of the elderly at risk of frailty. In a double-blind study that lasted three months, 17 elderly individuals fulfilling one frailty criteria (grip strength) were randomly distributed into two groups: SYN (n = 9), daily intake of synbiotic (6 g Frutooligossacarides, 108 to 109 CFU Lactobacillus paracasei, 108 to 109 CFU Lactobacillus rhamnosus, 108 to 109 CFU Lactobacillus acidophilus and 108 to 109 CFU Bifidobacterium lactis), or placebo (maltodextrin; PLA; n = 8). Subjects were analyzed for anthropometric measurements, bioelectric impedance with vectorial analysis (BIVA), IL-6 and TNF-alpha. A comparison between groups did not show any difference for the variables investigated. In turn, individual analysis of electrical impedance (BIVA) demonstrated that the majority of SYN individuals maintained or improved their tissue hydration, when compared to the PLA group after supplementation. In conclusion, three months of synbiotic supplementation did not promote any significant changes in inflammatory cytokines or body composition, but demonstrated a trend towards a preservation of hydration status in apparently healthy elderly individuals.
TI  - Anti-influenza virus effects of both live and non-live Lactobacillus acidophilus  L-92 accompanied by the activation of innate immunity.
AB  - The antiviral effects of both a live and non-live Lactobacillus acidophilus strain L-92 (L-92) were investigated by oral administration (10 mg/mouse per d) daily for 21 d in a mouse model infected intranasally with influenza virus (H1N1). Virus titres in the lung of mice administered either live or non-live L-92 cells daily for 15 d were repressed 6 d after virus infection compared with the control group. Natural killer (NK) activity in the orally administered non-live L-92 group was higher compared with that of the control group before virus infection and on day 6. In contrast, NK activity in the live L-92 group compared with the control group was not significantly changed on both days, but was significantly higher on day 1. In contrast, live L-92 showed a greater repression of virus proliferation compared with non-live L-92, 6 d after the infection. Live L-92 decreased the number of neutrophils in the lung and suppressed lung weight, leading to the consequent deterioration of consolidation scores of the lung. These results indicated that pretreatment of live or non-live L-92 cells had protective effects against influenza virus infection. Among the measured cytokines and chemokines, eotaxin, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-1b, RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) and interferon-a were significantly increased in the lung: IL-17 was significantly increased in Peyer's patch of the live L-92 group compared with the control group. A mechanistic study suggested that the enhancement of NK activity in the lung caused by stimulating various antiviral cytokines and chemokines after the oral administration of L-92 cells might be important in protecting against virus infection.
TI  - A mild pulsed electric field condition that improves acid tolerance, growth, and  protease activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-K and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subspecies bulgaricus LB-12.
AB  - Pulsed electric field (PEF) processing involves the application of pulses of voltage for less than 1 s to fluid products placed between 2 electrodes. The effect of mild PEF on beneficial characteristics of probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus is not clearly understood. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of mild PEF conditions on acid tolerance, growth, and protease activity of Lb. acidophilus LA-K and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus LB-12. A pilot plant PEF system (OSU-4M; The Ohio State University, Columbus) was used. The PEF treatments were positive square unipolar pulse width of 3 micros, pulse period of 0.5s, electric field strength of 1 kV/cm, delay time of 20 micros, flow rate of 60 mL/min, and 40.5 degrees C PEF treatment temperature. Both Lb. acidophilus LA-K and Lb. bulgaricus LB-12 subjected to mild PEF conditions were acid tolerant until the end of the 120 min of incubation, unlike the Lb. bulgaricus control, which was not acid tolerant after 30 min. The mild PEF-treated Lb. acidophilus LA-K and Lb. bulgaricus LB-12 reached the logarithmic phase of growth an hour earlier than the control. Mild PEF conditions studied significantly improved acid tolerance, exponential growth, and protease activity of both Lb. acidophilus LA-K and Lb. bulgaricus LB-12 compared with the control. The mild PEF conditions studied can be recommended for pretreating cultures to enhance these desirable attributes.
TI  - Antibacterial efficacy of prophylactic ozone treatment on patients with fixed orthodontic appliances.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the efficacy of ozone on microflora of patients with fixed orthodontic appliances. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten subjects undergoing fixed appliance therapy were enrolled in the study. Before any application, two elastic ligatures were removed with the aid of a sterile probe from the premolar brackets on the upper right and lower left jaws for baseline bacteriological counts. Then ozone gas was applied for 180 s by running the device on prophylaxis mode with included mouth tray according to the manufacturer's recommendations on all brackets. After the ozone application, two other elastic ligatures were removed from the opposite sides of the mouth of the patients. One week after the application two more elastic samples, which were not changed in the previous session, were collected from the upper right and lower left premolar brackets. The elastic ligatures were immersed in transfer solutions and cultured to determine the Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Statistical analysis of the data was obtained by paired Student's t-tests. RESULTS: The ozone treatment reduced the S. mutans and L. acidophilus immediately after the application and these reductions were found to be statistically significant (p = 0.038 and p = 0.020). Both the S. mutans and L. acidophilus values increased by the 1-week period and the S. mutans values were significantly higher than the baseline values (p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that the ozone treatment may have an instantaneous lethal effect on S. mutans and L. acidophilus; however, within the limitations of this study, a long-term preventive effect could not be observed.
TI  - Prospective, randomized, open-label trial comparing the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of an acne treatment regimen with and without a probiotic supplement and minocycline in subjects with mild to moderate acne.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Systemic antibiotics are an effective treatment for acne vulgaris. However, intolerable side effects may invariably occur. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether probiotics reduce the side effects imparted by systemic antibiotics while working synergistically with the latter in treating inflammatory acne. METHODS: Forty-five 18- to 35-year-old females were randomly assigned to one of three arms in this prospective, open-label study. Group A received probiotic supplementation, whereas group B received only minocycline. Group C was treated with both probiotic and minocycline. Clinical and subjective assessments were completed at baseline and during the 2-, 4-, 8-, and 12-week follow-up visits. RESULTS: All patients demonstrated a significant improvement in total lesion count 4 weeks after treatment initiation (p < .001), with continued improvement seen with each subsequent follow-up visit (p < .01). At the 8- and 12-week follow-up visits, group C had a significant decrease in total lesion count versus groups A (p < .001) and B (p < .01). Two patients (13%) from group B failed to complete the study secondary to vaginal candidiasis. CONCLUSION: Probiotics may be considered a therapeutic option or adjunct for acne vulgaris by providing a synergistic antiinflammatory effect with systemic antibiotics while also reducing potential adverse events secondary to chronic antibiotic use.
TI  - In vitro growth of four individual human gut bacteria on oligosaccharides produced by chemoenzymatic synthesis.
AB  - The present study aimed at examining oligosaccharides (OS) for potential stimulation of probiotic bacteria. Nineteen structurally well-defined candidate OS covering groups of beta-glucosides, alpha-glucosides and alpha-galactosides with degree of polymerization 2-4 were prepared in >100 mg amounts by chemoenzymatic synthesis (i.e. reverse phosphorolysis or transglycosylation). Fourteen of the OS are not naturally occurring and five (beta-D-glucosyl-fructose, beta-D-glucosyl-xylitol, alpha-glucosyl-(1,4)-D-mannose, alpha-glucosyl-(1,4)-D-xylose; alpha-glucosyl-(1,4)-L-fucose) have recently been synthesized for the first time. These OS have not been previously tested for effects of bacterial growth and here the ability of all 19 OS to support growth of four gastrointestinal bacteria: three probiotic bacteria Bifidobacterium lactis, Bifidobacterium longum, and Lactobacillus acidophilus, and one commensal bacterium, Bacteroides vulgatus has been evaluated in monocultures. The disaccharides beta-D-glucosyl-xylitol and beta-D-glucosyl-(1,4)-xylose noticeably stimulated growth yields of L. acidophilus NCFM, and additionally, beta-D-glucosyl-(1,4)-xylose stimulated B. longum Bl-05. alpha-Glucosyl-(1,4)-glucosamine and alpha-glucosyl-(1,4)-N-acetyl-glucosamine enhanced the growth rate of B. animalis subsp. lactis and B. longum Bl-05, whereas L. acidophilus NCFM and Bac. vulgatus did not grow on these OS. alpha-Galactosyl-(1,6)-alpha-galactosyl-(1,6)-glucose advanced the growth rate of B. animalis subsp. lactis and L. acidophilus NCFM. Thus several of the structurally well-defined OS supported growth of beneficial gut bacteria. This reflects a broad specificity of their sugar transporters for OS, including specificity for non-naturally occurring OS, hence showing promise for design of novel prebiotics.
TI  - Efficacy of barley based probiotic food mixture in treatment of pathogenic E.coli induced diarrhoea in mice.
AB  - An indigenous food mixture was developed by mixing barley flour (raw and germinated), whey powder and tomato pulp in the ratio of 2:1:1:1 (w/w). The developed food (100 g) was mixed with water (500 ml) and autoclaved at 1.5 kg/cm(2) for 15 min. It was then cooled and inoculated with Lactobacillus acidophilus curd (5%) and incubated at 37 degrees C for 12 h containing 10(6) cfu/ml broth. Fermented food mixture formulated from germinated barley flour maintained adequate cell viability (8.88 cfu/ml) as compared to non-germinated food mixture. To study the therapeutic effect of the food mixture, diarrhoea was induced in mice using 0.5 ml of aqueous suspension orally with the help of sterilized syringe to each of the overnight fasted mice and the mice were examined till onset of diarrhoea. The aqueous suspension was prepared by using 10 ml of six h old culture of E. coli cells (5 x 10(11) cfu/ml) and 6 ml alkaline solution (powdered chalk (40%), colloidal kaolin (43%) and magnesium trisilicate (17%) and both were mixed in 10:6 (v/v) proportions. After induction of diarrhoea, the mice were divided in two groups, control and experimental. The control group was fed on unfermented food mixture whereas experimental group was fed on fermented food mixture. Faecal ash, nitrogen, moisture and coliform count increased while faecal lactobacilli count decreased in mice having diarrhoea. In the experimental group, which was fed on fermented food mixture, normal values were reached within 7 days of feeding but no such changes were observed in control group which was fed on unfermented food mixture. Liver and kidney showed lesions due to E. coli infection were significantly alleviated on feeding of probiotic food mixture.
TI  - Sequence analysis of a cryptic plasmid pKW2124 from Weissella cibaria KLC140 and  construction of a surface display vector.
AB  - Plasmid isolation of kimchi-derived Weissella cibaria KLC140 revealed six different plasmids. The smallest plasmid, pKW2124, was DNA sequenced and characterized, showing 2,124 bp with a GC content of 36.39% and five putative open reading frames (ORFs). In silico analysis of these ORFs showed ORF1 encodes a putative replication protein similar to rolling circular replication proteins from other lactic acid bacteria. However, a single-stranded intermediate was not detected when S1 nuclease was treated, suggesting it may follow theta replication. Interestingly, the replication initiation site of this plasmid is 100% identical to other plasmids from lactic acid bacteria, suggesting it may function for replication initiation. To construct a surface layer expression vector, pTSLGFP, slpA encoding the surface layer protein from Lactobacillus acidophilus was PCR amplified and fused with the gfp gene, forming a SLGFP fused gene. The plasmid pKW2124 was cloned into the XbaI site of pUC19, forming an Weissella-E. coli shuttle vector pKUW22. NheI-linearized pTSLGFP was ligated into pKUWCAT containing pKUW22 and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene from pEK104, resulting in an 8.6 kb pKWCSLGFP surface layer expression vector. After transformation of this vector into W. cibaria KLC140, a GFP fluorescence signal was detected on the surface of the transformant, substantiating production of SLGFP fused protein and its secretion. This is the first report for construction of a Weissella surface layer expression vector, which may be useful for surface layer production of beneficial proteins in Weissella.
TI  - The substitution of a traditional starter culture in mutton fermented sausages by Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium animalis.
AB  - Common starter cultures used in fermented mutton sausages were substituted by probiotic strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus CCDM 476 and Bifidobacterium animalis 241a. Technological properties of the traditional and the probiotic sausages were compared. The potential probiotic effect was evaluated by enumeration of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in stool samples of 15 volunteers before and after a 14-day consumption period. The numbers of lactobacilli (10(7) cfu/g) and bifidobacteria (10(3) cfu/g) in the final product did not affect the technological properties. The use of L. acidophilus as a starter culture was found more beneficial than the use of B. animalis. Even after 60 days of storage, high counts of L. acidophilus (10(6) cfu/g) were detected; on the other hand, the counts of B. animalis were under the detection limit. Regarding sensory properties, the probiotic products showed better texture, and, curiously, a reduction of the typical smell of mutton. The numbers of lactobacilli in stool samples increased significantly after the consumption of the probiotic sausages.
TI  - Lactobacillus isolates from healthy volunteers exert immunomodulatory effects on  activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
AB  - As probiotics in the gut, Lactobacilli are believed to play important roles in the development and maintenance of both the mucosal and systemic immune system of the host. This study was aimed to investigate the immuno-modulatory function of candiate lactobacilli on T cells. Lactobacilli were isolated from healthy human feces and the microbiological characteristics were identified by API 50 CHL and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) assays. Anti-CD3 antibody activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were treated by viable, heat-killed lactobacilli and genomic DNA of lactobacilli, and cytokine profiles were tested by ELISA. Isolated lactobacilli C44 and C48 were identified as L. acidophilus and L. paracacei, which have properties of acid and bile tolerance and inhibitor effects on pathogens. Viable and heat-killed C44 and C48 induced low levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-8) and high levels of IFN-gamma and IL-12p70 in PBMCs. In anti-CD3 antibody activated PBMCs, viable and heat-killed C44 increased Th2 cytokine levels (IL-5, IL-6 and IL-10), and simultaneously enhanced Th1 responses by inducing IFN-gamma and IL-12p70 production. Different from that of lactabacillus strains, their genomic DNA induced low levels of IL-12p70, IFN-gamma and proinflammatory cytokines in PBMCs with or without anti-CD3 antibody activation. These results provided in vitro evidence that the genomic DNA of strains of C44 and C48, especially C44, induced weaker inflammation, and may be potentially applied for treating allergic diseases.
TI  - The effects of bee pollen extracts on the broiler chicken's gastrointestinal microflora.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of bee pollen ethanolic extracts on the in vivo gastrointestinal tract microflora colonization of broiler chickens. A completely randomized experiment based on six treatments (different concentrations of bee pollen - 0, 5, 15, 25, 35 and 45 g kg(-1) diet) was used during 7 weeks. The highest count of faecal Enterococci was found in the experimental group with the addition of 15 g of pollen (8.85 +/- 0.87 log CFU g(-1)) per 1 kg of feed mixture. The highest count of Lactobacilli was detected in the experimental group with 35 g of pollen per 1 kg of feed mixture and the highest number of the Enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in the control group (8.43 +/- 0.15 log CFU g(-1)). Moreover, the MALDI TOF MS Biotyper identified the following genera: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, as well as Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. crispatus, L. fermentum and L. salivarius from the Lactobacilli group and Enterococcus avium, E. casseliflavus, E. cecorum, E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. gallinarum, E. hirae and E. malodoratus from the Enterococci group. Additionally, the in vitro antimicrobial activities of pollen against five bacteria species isolated from gastrointestinal tracts of chickens were tested. The best antimicrobial effect of the pollen extract was detected against K. oxytoca.
TI  - Effect of probiotic species on irritable bowel syndrome symptoms: A bring up to date meta-analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: immune system alteration in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients may be modulated by probiotics. We assessed the efficacy of some probiotic species in alleviating characteristic IBS symptoms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: a meta-analysis of all identified randomized controlled trials comparing probiotics with placebo in treating IBS symptoms was performed with continuous data summarized using standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), where appropriate. The random-effects model was employed in cases of heterogeneity; otherwise, fixed-effects models were used. RESULTS: meta-analysis was performed with 10 of 24 studies identified as suitable for inclusion. Probiotics improved pain scores if they contained Bifidobacterium breve (SMD, - 0.34; 95% CI, - 0.66; -0.02), Bifidobacterium longum (SMD, -0.48; 95% CI, - 0.91; -0.06), or Lactobacillus acidophilus (SMD, -0.31; 95% CI, -0.61; -0.01) species. Distension scores were improved by probiotics containing B. breve (SMD, -0.45; 95% CI, -0.77; -0.13), Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus casei, or Lactobacillus plantarum (SMD, -0.53; 95% CI, -1.00; -0.06) species. All probiotic species tested improved flatulence: B. breve (SMD, -0.42; 95% CI, -0.75;- 0.10), B. infantis, L. casei, L. plantarum (SMD, -0.60; 95% CI, -1.07; -0.13), B. longum, L. acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (SMD, -0.61; 95% CI, -1.01; -0.21). There was not a clear positive effect of probiotics concerning the quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: some probiotics are an effective therapeutic option for IBS patients, and the effects on each IBS symptom are likely species-specific. Future studies must focus on the role of probiotics in modulating intestinal microbiota and the immune system while considering individual patient symptom profiles.
TI  - Effects of encapsulated Lactobacillus acidophilus along with pasteurized longan juice on the colon microbiota residing in a dynamic simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem.
AB  - The effect of encapsulated Lactobacillus acidophilus LA5 along with pasteurized longan juice on the colon microbiota was investigated by applying a dynamic model of the human gastrointestinal tract. Encapsulated L. acidophilus LA5 in pasteurized longan juice or sole encapsulated L. acidophilus LA5 exhibited the efficiency of colonizing the colon and enabling the growth of colon lactobacilli as well as beneficial bifidobacteria but inhibited the growth of fecal coliforms and clostridia. Moreover, these treatments gave rise to a significant increase of lactic acid and short-chain fatty acids such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate. Although acetate displayed the highest quantity, it was likely that after incorporating encapsulated L. acidophilus LA5 plus pasteurized longan juice, quantity of butyrate exceed propionate, and acetate in comparison with their controls. Denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis patterns confirmed that various treatments affected the alteration of microbial community within the simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem.
TI  - Distribution dynamics of recombinant Lactobacillus in the gastrointestinal tract  of neonatal rats.
AB  - One approach to deliver therapeutic agents, especially proteins, to the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract is to use commensal bacteria as a carrier. Genus Lactobacillus is an attractive candidate for use in this approach. However, a system for expressing exogenous proteins at a high level has been lacking in Lactobacillus. Moreover, it will be necessary to introduce the recombinant Lactobacillus into the GI tract, ideally by oral administration. Whether orally administered Lactobacillus can reach and reside in the GI tract has not been explored in neonates. In this study, we have examined these issues in neonatal rats. To achieve a high level of protein expression in Lactobacillus, we tested the impact of three promoters and two backbones on protein expression levels using mRFP1, a red fluorescent protein, as a reporter. We found that a combination of an L-lactate dehydrogenase (ldhL) promoter of Lactobacillus sakei with a backbone from pLEM415 yielded the highest level of reporter expression. When this construct was used to transform Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Lactobacillus acidophilus, high levels of mRFP1 were detected in all these species and colonies of transformed Lactobacillus appeared pink under visible light. To test whether orally administered Lactobacillus can be retained in the GI tract of neonates, we fed the recombinant Lactobacillus casei to neonatal rats. We found that about 3% of the bacteria were retained in the GI tract of the rats at 24 h after oral feeding with more recombinant Lactobacillus in the stomach and small intestine than in the cecum and colon. No mortality was observed throughout this study with Lactobacillus. In contrast, all neonatal rats died within 24 hours after fed with transformed E. coli. Taken together, our results indicate that Lactobacillus has the potential to be used as a vehicle for the delivery of therapeutic agents to neonates.
TI  - Impact of inulin and okara on Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 and Bifidobacterium  animalis Bb-12 viability in a fermented soy product and probiotic survival under in vitro simulated gastrointestinal conditions.
AB  - The effect of inulin and/or okara flour on Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 and Bifidobacterium animalis Bb-12 viability in a fermented soy product (FSP) and on probiotic survival under in vitro simulated gastrointestinal conditions were investigated throughout 28 days of storage at 4 degrees C. Employing a 2(2) design, four FSP trials were produced from soymilk fermented with ABT-4 culture (La-5, Bb-12, and Streptococcus thermophilus): FSP (control); FSP-I (with inulin, 3 g/100 mL of soymilk); FSP-O (with okara, 5 g/100 mL); FSP-IO (with inulin + okara, ratio 3:5 g/100 mL). Probiotic viabilities ranged from 8 to 9 log cfu/g during the 28 days of storage, and inulin and/or okara flour did not affect the viability of La-5 and Bb-12. Bb-12 resistance to the artificial gastrointestinal juices was higher than for La-5, since the Bb-12 and La-5 populations decreased approximately 0.6 log cfu/g and 3.8 log cfu/g, respectively, throughout storage period. Even though the protective effect of inulin and/or okara flour on probiotic microorganisms was not significant, when compared to a fresh culture, the FSP matrix improved Bb-12 survival on day 1 of storage and may be considered a good vehicle for Bb-12 and could play an important role in probiotic protection against gastrointestinal juices.
TI  - Preparation of an orthodontic bracket coated with an nitrogen-doped TiO(2-x)N(y)  thin film and examination of its antimicrobial performance.
AB  - A bracket coated with a nitrogen-doped (N-doped) TiO(2-x)N(y) thin film was prepared using the RF magnetron sputtering method. The physicochemical properties of the thin film were measured using X-ray diffraction and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry, while the antimicrobial activity of the bracket against common oral pathogenic microbes was assessed on the basis of colony counts. The rate of antimicrobial activity of the bracket coated with nano-TiO(2-x)N(y) thin film against Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Actinomyces viscous, and Candida albicans was 95.19%, 91.00%, 69.44%, and 98.86%, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy showed that fewer microbes adhered to the surface of this newly designed bracket than to the surface of the normal edgewise bracket. The brackets coated with the N-doped TiO(2-x)N(y) thin film showed high antimicrobial and bacterial adhesive properties against normal oral pathogenic bacterial through visible light, which is effective in prevention of enamel demineralization and gingivitis in orthodontic patients.
TI  - In vitro assessment of functional properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from faecal microbiota of healthy dogs for potential use as probiotics.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were isolated and identified in the faeces of Chinese Crested and Yorkshire terrier pups and their probiotic features were investigated in vitro. Thirty seven isolates were identified as Lactobacillus or Enterococcus. Out of these isolates, 31 were lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and belonged to the species Lactobacillus reuteri (16/37; 43.3%), Lactobacillus animalis (7/37; 18.9%), Lactobacillus acidophilus (3/37; 8.1%), Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis (2/37; 5.4%), Lactobacillus murinus (2/37; 5.4%), and Lactobacillus paraplantarum (1/37; 2.7%), while six other LAB isolates were Enterococcus spp. (6/37; 16.2%). Strains were tested for resistance to gastric acidity (pH 2.5 for 3 h) and bile salts (0.3% ox gall), cell surface hydrophobicity by microbial adhesion to solvents, antagonism against pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes), production of hydrogen peroxide, and antibiotic susceptibility. Thirty four strains were highly resistant to acidic conditions with slight (18 strains) to moderate (16 strains) growth inhibition by bile salts. Seven isolates had highly hydrophobic cellular surfaces and 28 strains exhibited strong antagonism against the bacterial pathogens tested, although 8 isolates tested against Leptospira interrogans had no effect on pathogen growth. All isolates produced low rates of hydrogen peroxide. Based on these results, two Lactobacillus strains showed promising probiotic-related features and merit investigation as probiotics for dogs.
TI  - Efficacy of different probiotic combinations on death and necrotizing enterocolitis in a premature rat model.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the most effective probiotic combinations to prevent death and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in a premature rat model. METHODS: One hundred fifty-eight premature Sprague-Dawley premature rats were enrolled. Probiotic strains Bifidobacterium bifidum, B longum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L plantarum, and B breve were fed as a single strain or mixture with 2 or 3 strains for a total of 9 study groups; control groups received no exogenous probiotic supplement. Fecal samples were collected for 72 hours to detect probiotic strains and pathologic strains by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Colony counts of probiotic strains Escherichia coli and Klebsiella were compared between groups before and after 36 hours of the study period. The incidence of death and NEC were compared via Fisher exact test between groups. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that L plantarum alone (P = 0.0026) and B bifidum with B longum together (P = 0.0017) were more effective in reducing NEC as compared with the control group. All of the study groups except B breve and B bifidum with B breve definitely prevented death compared with controls. B bifidum and B longum together had significantly lower mortality than the control group (P < 0.0001). Colony counts of E coli and Klebsiella in stool samples were significantly decreased in the B bifidum, B longum, and L plantarum group compared with the other study and control groups after 36 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of a mixture of probiotic strains with B bifidum and B longum was most effective in preventing death and NEC in this animal model, and these observations provide an evidence-based strategy for designing further neonatal clinical trials.
TI  - Association of a probiotic to a Helicobacter pylori eradication regimen does not  increase efficacy or decreases the adverse effects of the treatment: a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The treatment for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)  is complex; full effectiveness is rarely achieved and it has many adverse effects. In developing countries, increased resistance to antibiotics and its cost make eradication more difficult. Probiotics can reduce adverse effects and improve the infection treatment efficacy.If the first-line therapy fails a second-line treatment using tetracycline, furazolidone and proton-pump inhibitors has been effective and low cost in Brazil; however it implies in a lot of adverse effects. The aim of this study was to minimize the adverse effects and increase the eradication rate applying the association of a probiotic compound to second-line therapy regimen. METHODS: Patients with peptic ulcer or functional dyspepsia infected by H. pylori were randomized to treatment with the furazolidone, tetracycline and lansoprazole regimen, twice a day for 7 days. In a double-blind study, patients received placebo or a probiotic compound (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium bifidum and Streptococcus faecium) in capsules, twice a day for 30 days. A symptom questionnaire was administered in day zero, after completion of antibiotic therapy, after the probiotic use and eight weeks after the end of the treatment. Upper digestive endoscopy, histological assessment, rapid urease test and breath test were performed before and eight weeks after eradication treatment. RESULTS: One hundred and seven patients were enrolled: 21 men with active probiotic and 19 with placebo plus 34 women with active probiotic and 33 with placebo comprising a total of 55 patients with active probiotic and 52 with placebo. Fifty-one patients had peptic ulcer and 56 were diagnosed as functional dyspepsia. The per-protocol eradication rate with active probiotic was 89.8% and with placebo, 85.1% (p=0.49); per intention to treat, 81.8% and 79.6%, respectively (p=0.53). The rate of adverse effects at 7 days with the active probiotic was 59.3% and 71.2% with placebo (p=0.20). At 30 days, it was 44.9% and 60.4%, respectively (p=0.08). CONCLUSIONS: The use of this probiotic compound compared to placebo in the proposed regimen in Brazilian patients with peptic ulcer or functional dyspepsia showed no significant difference in efficacy or adverse effects. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN04714018.
TI  - Physicochemical properties of Scamorza ewe milk cheese manufactured with different probiotic cultures.
AB  - The present study was undertaken to produce functional Scamorza cheese from Gentile di Puglia ewe milk by incorporating probiotic strains into the cheese matrix and to evaluate the physicochemical characteristics of Scamorza ewe milk cheese. Gentile di Puglia ewe bulk milk was used for Scamorza cheese production. Cheeses were denoted S-CO for control Scamorza cheese, S-BB for Scamorza cheese made using a mix of Bifidobacterium longum and Bifidobacterium lactis, and S-LA for Scamorza cheese made using Lactobacillus acidophilus as probiotic strain. Cheeses were analyzed at 1, 7, and 15 d of ripening. Probiotic cell recovery in cheese was 7.55 +/- 0.07 log10 cfu/g and 9.09 +/- 0.04 log10 cfu/g in S-LA and S-BB cheese, respectively; probiotic cheeses also displayed the highest levels of lactic microflora. Reverse-phase HPLC chromatograms of the water-soluble nitrogen fraction showed a more complex profile in S-BB, with distinctive peaks in the early-eluting zone. The matured Scamorza cheese containing the mix of B. longum and B. lactis was characterized by significantly higher levels of Gln, Ser, Arg, Ile, and Leu, whereas cheese containing Lb. acidophilus was characterized by higher levels of Tyr and Met. Total FFA content was the highest in S-LA, intermediate in S-BB, and the lowest in S-CO cheese; in particular, Scamorza cheese containing Lb. acidophilus showed the highest level of vaccenic acid, oleic acid, and total conjugated linoleic acid. Probiotic bacteria survived through the technological phases of pasta filata cheese production, maintained their specific metabolic pathways, and conferred functional properties to Scamorza ewe milk cheese.
TI  - Composition and sensory profiling of probiotic Scamorza ewe milk cheese.
AB  - The present study aimed to assess the effect of the addition of different usually recognized as probiotic bacterial strains on chemical composition and sensory properties of Scamorza cheese manufactured from ewe milk. To define the sensory profile of Scamorza cheese, a qualitative and quantitative reference frame specific for a pasta filata cheese was constructed. According to the presence of probiotic bacteria, cheeses were denoted S-BB for Scamorza cheese made using a mix of Bifidobacterium longum 46 and Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12, and S-LA for Scamorza cheese made using Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5. The designation for control Scamorza cheese was S-CO. Analyses were performed at 15d of ripening. The moisture content of Scamorza ewe milk cheese ranged between 44.61 and 47.16% (wt/wt), showing higher values in S-CO and S-BB cheeses than in S-LA cheese; the fat percentage ranged between 25.43 and 28.68% (wt/wt), showing higher value in S-LA cheese. The NaCl percentage in Scamorza cheese from ewe milk was 1.75 +/- 0.04% (wt/wt). Protein and casein percentages were the highest in Scamorza cheese containing a mix of bifidobacteria; also, the percentage of the proteose-peptone fraction showed the highest value in S-BB, highlighting the major proteolysis carried out by enzymes associated with B. longum and B. lactis strains. Texture and appearance attributes were able to differentiate probiotic bacteria-added cheeses from the untreated control product. In particular, S-BB and S-LA Scamorza cheeses showed higher color uniformity compared with S-CO cheese. Furthermore, the control cheese showed higher yellowness and lower structure uniformity than S-BB. The control product was less creamy and grainy than S-BB; conversely, the inclusion of probiotics into the cheese determined lower adhesivity and friability in S-BB and S-LA than in S-CO. This study allowed the definition of the principal composition and sensory properties of Scamorza ewe milk cheese. The specific quantitative vocabulary for sensory analysis and reference frame for assessor training also established in this study should be implemented to systematically monitor the quality of this new typology of ewe milk cheese.
TI  - Crystal structure analysis of a fatty acid double-bond hydratase from Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Bacteria have evolved mechanisms for the hydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids. Hydroxy fatty acid formation may be the first step in such a process; however, knowledge of the structural and mechanistic aspects of this reaction is scarce. Recently, myosin cross-reactive antigen was shown to be a bacterial FAD-containing hydratase which acts on the 9Z and 12Z double bonds of C16 and C18 non-esterified fatty acids, with the formation of 10-hydroxy and 10,13-dihydroxy fatty acids. These fatty acid hydratases form a large protein family which is conserved across Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with no sequence similarity to any known protein apart from the FAD-binding motif. In order to shed light on the substrate recognition and the mechanism of the hydratase reaction, the crystal structure of the hydratase from Lactobacillus acidophilus (LAH) was determined by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion. Crystal structures of apo LAH and of LAH with bound linoleic acid were refined at resolutions of 2.3 and 1.8 A, respectively. LAH is a homodimer; each protomer consists of four intricately connected domains. Three of them form the FAD-binding and substrate-binding sites and reveal structural similarity to three domains of several flavin-dependent enzymes, including amine oxidoreductases. The additional fourth domain of LAH is located at the C-terminus and consists of three alpha-helices. It covers the entrance to the hydrophobic substrate channel leading from the protein surface to the active site. In the presence of linoleic acid, the fourth domain of one protomer undergoes conformational changes and opens the entrance to the substrate-binding channel of the other protomer of the LAH homodimer. The linoleic acid molecule is bound at the entrance to the substrate channel, suggesting movement of the lid domain triggered by substrate recognition.
TI  - Improved membrane protein expression in Lactococcus lactis by fusion to Mistic.
AB  - Difficulty overexpressing (eukaryotic) membrane proteins is generally considered  as the major impediment in their structural and functional research. Lactococcus lactis possesses many properties ideal for membrane protein expression. In order to investigate membrane protein expression in L. lactis, we created a novel expression system by introducing Mistic, a short peptide previously identified in Bacillus subtilis, into L. lactis. The potential of this system was demonstrated in the overexpression of a eukaryotic membrane protein (pkjDes4) and a prokaryotic membrane protein (pkjLi), a newly isolated linoleate isomerase from Lactobacillus acidophilus. The expression levels reached up to 4.4 % and 45.2 % for pkjDes4 and pkjLi, respectively, which represented an exceptionally robust ability to overproduce membrane proteins. Moreover, the expressed pkjLi was functional, with its catalysing nature characterized for the first time in this species. Up to 0.852 mg ml(-1) conjugated linoleic acid was obtained during the linoleic acid conversion catalysed by the recombinant lactococcal strains. In summary, we established a membrane protein expression system in L. lactis and examined its functionality. Our results demonstrate that the Mistic chaperoning strategy can be efficiently applied to L. lactis hosts and show its extraordinary capacity to facilitate the high-yield production of intractable membrane proteins.
TI  - Comparable effects of low-intensity electromagnetic irradiation at the frequency  of 51.8 and 53 GHz and antibiotic ceftazidime on Lactobacillus acidophilus growth and survival.
AB  - The effects of low-intensity electromagnetic irradiation (EMI) with the frequencies of 51.8 and 53 GHz on Lactobacillus acidophilus growth and survival were revealed. These effects were compared with antibacterial effects of antibiotic ceftazidime. Decrease in bacterial growth rate by EMI was comparable with the inhibitory effect of ceftazidime (minimal inhibitory concentration-16 muM) and no enhanced action was observed with combined effects of EMI and the antibiotic. However, EMI-enhanced antibiotic inhibitory effect on bacterial survival. The kinetics of the bacterial suspension oxidation-reduction potential up to 24 h of the growth was changed by EMI and ceftazidime. The changes were more strongly expressed by combined effects of EMI and antibiotic especially up to 12 h. Moreover, EMI did not change overall energy (glucose)-dependent H(+) efflux across the membrane but it increased N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD)-inhibited H(+) efflux. In contrast, this EMI in combination with ceftazidime decreased DCCD-sensitive H(+) efflux. Low-intensity EMI had inhibitory effect on L. acidophilus bacterial growth and survival. The effect on bacterial survival was more significant in the combination with ceftazidime. The H(+)-translocating F 0 F 1-ATPase, for which DCCD is specific inhibitor, might be a target for EMI and ceftazidime. The revealed bactericide effects on L. acidophilus can be applied in biotechnology, food producing and safety technology.
TI  - Genomic and phenotypic evidence for probiotic influences of Lactobacillus gasseri on human health.
AB  - Certain lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have the capacity to occupy mucosal niches of  humans, including the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and vagina. Among commensal, LAB are species of the acidophilus complex, which have proven to be a substantial reservoir for microorganisms with probiotic attributes. Specifically, Lactobacillus gasseri is an autochthonous microorganism which has been evaluated for probiotic activity based on the availability of genome sequence and species-specific adaptation to the human mucosa. Niche-related characteristics of L. gasseri contributing to indigenous colonization include tolerance of low pH environments, resistance to bile salts, and adhesion to the host epithelium. In humans, L. gasseri elicits various health benefits through its antimicrobial activity, bacteriocin production, and immunomodulation of the innate and adaptive systems. The genomic and empirical evidence supporting use of L. gasseri in probiotic applications is substantiated by clinical trial data displaying maintenance of vaginal homeostasis, mitigation of Helicobacter pylori infection, and amelioration of diarrhea.
TI  - Broad-spectrum antibacterial activity of carbon nanotubes to human gut bacteria.
AB  - Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) hold promise in manufacturing, environmental, and biomedical applications, as well as food and agricultural industries. Previous observations have shown that CNTs have antimicrobial activity; however, the impact of CNTs to human gut microbes has not been investigated. Here, the antibacterial activity of CNTs against the microbes commonly encountered in the human digestion system--L. acidophilus, B. adolescentis, E. coli, E. faecalis, and S. aureus--are evaluated. The bacteria studied include pathogenic and non-pathogenic, gram-positive and negative, and both sphere and rod strains. In this study, CNTs, including single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs, 1-3 mum), short and long multi-walled CNTs (s-MWCNTs: 0.5-2 mum; l-MWCNTs: >50 mum), and functionalized multi-walled CNTs (hydroxyl- and carboxyl-modification, 0.5-2 mum), all have broad-spectrum antibacterial effects. Notably, CNTs may selectively lyse the walls and membranes of human gut microbes, depending on not only the length and surface functional groups of CNTs, but also the shapes of the bacteria. The mechanism of antibacterial activity is associated with their diameter-dependent piercing and length-dependent wrapping on the lysis of microbial walls and membranes, inducing release of intracellular components DNA and RNA and allowing a loss of bacterial membrane potential, demonstrating complete destruction of bacteria. Thin and rigid SWCNT show more effective wall/membrane piercing on spherical bacteria than MWCNTs. Long MWCNT may wrap around gut bacteria, increasing the area making contact with the bacterial wall. This work suggests that CNTs may be broad-spectrum and efficient antibacterial agents in the gut, and selective application of CNTs could reduce the potential hazard to probiotic bacteria.
TI  - Infection with feline immunodeficiency virus alters intestinal epithelial transport and mucosal immune responses to probiotics.
AB  - HIV infection is associated with intestinal mucosal dysfunction and probiotics offer the therapeutic potential to enhance the mucosal barrier in HIV+ patients. To evaluate the response of immunocompromised hosts to probiotics, we orally administered Lactobacillus acidophilus to cats with chronic feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection. FIV infection significantly affected transcellular, but not paracellular, transport of small molecules across the intestinal epithelium. Additionally, probiotic treatment of FIV+ cats resulted in changes in cytokine release and mucosal leukocyte percentages that were not paralleled in FIV- cats. These results suggest a novel role for FIV in upregulating transcellular transport across the gastrointestinal epithelial barrier and demonstrate the potential therapeutic use of probiotic bacteria to restore intestinal homeostasis.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of silver diamine fluoride on multi-species cariogenic biofilm on caries.
AB  - BACKGROUNDS: Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) has clinical success in arresting dentin caries, this study aimed to investigate its mechanism of action. METHODS: Using a computer-controlled artificial mouth, we studied the effect of 38% SDF on cariogenic biofilms and dentin carious lesions. We used five common cariogenic bacteria (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Actinomyces naeslundii) to form a cariogenic biofilm that generated carious lesions with a depth of approximately 70 um on human dentin blocks. We applied 38% SDF to the lesions in the test group and water to those in the control group. The blocks were incubated in the artificial mouth for 21 days before evaluation. Microbial kinetics, architecture, viability and distribution were evaluated every 7 days using colony forming unit (CFU), scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The physical properties of the carious lesions were evaluated with microhardness testing, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR). RESULTS: The CFU results revealed fewer colony forming units in the test group compared with the control group (p < 0.01). Scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy showed less bacterial growth in the test group, and confluent cariogenic biofilm in the control group (p < 0.01). The microhardness and weight percentages of calcium and phosphorus in the test group from the outermost 50mum were higher than in the control group (p < 0.05). EDS showed that calcium and phosphous were higher in outer 50 mum in test groups than in the control FTIR revealed less exposed collagen I in the test lesions compared with the control group (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: 38% SDF inhibits multi-species cariogenic biofilm formation on dentin carious lesions and reduces the demineralization process.
TI  - Effects of clinoptilolite and modified clinoptilolite on the growth performance,  intestinal microflora, and gut parameters of broilers.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of natural clinoptilolite (NCLI) and modified clinoptilolite (MCLI) on broiler performance, gut morphology, and its relation to gut circumstances. A total of two hundred forty 1-d-old male chicks were randomly assigned to 3 treatments, each of which comprised 8 pens of 10 chicks per pen. Birds in the control group were fed the basal diet, whereas those in the experimental groups were fed diets supplemented with NCLI at 2% (NCLI group) or MCLI at 2% (MCLI group) for 42 d. The results showed that compared with the control, supplementation with NCLI or MCLI had no significant (P > 0.05) effects on productive parameters from d 1 to 42. Supplementation with MCLI and NCLI was associated with greater (P < 0.05) villus height in the jejunal and ileal mucosa compared with those areas in the controls from d 1 to 42. However, supplementation with NCLI and MCLI had no significant (P > 0.05) influence on the crypt depth in the jejunal and ileal mucosa compared with those in the controls. Total viable counts of Escherichia coli were significantly (P < 0.05) decreased by MCLI and NCLI from d 1 to 21. The NCLI and MCLI significantly increased the total viable counts of Lactobacillus acidophilus from d 22 to 42. Small intestine and cecal pH values in the MCLI group were found to be lower (P < 0.05) than those in other groups. Total volatile fatty acid concentrations were significantly (P < 0.05) decreased in both experimental groups from d 22 to 42. This study showed that NCLI or MCLI, as feed additives for broilers, had a positive effect on gut parameters by acting on microbial populations of the digestive tract.
TI  - Use of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei for a potential probiotic legume-based fermented product using pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan).
AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the use of pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) as an appropriate substrate in the production of a legume-based fermented product with Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 314 or Lactobacillus casei ATCC 393 and then to ascertain the effects of the addition of ingredients such as powdered milk and banana or strawberry sauce. The products were analyzed for viable cell counts, pH, and sensory attributes during product manufacture and throughout the refrigerated storage period at 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days. Nine types of products were produced. At the end of the storage period, the viability of L. acidophilus was above 7 log CFU/g in the presence of milk and 20% sucrose fruit sauce. For products with L. casei, the lack of ingredients such as milk caused no significant loss in viability; however, a high concentration of sucrose in the fruit sauce was an important factor in maintaining a high L. casei population. L. casei had high viability and good sensory attributes. Both strains could be considered suitable for a pigeon pea-based fermented potential probiotic product and a low-cost protein source.
TI  - Effect of Lactobacillus brevis 119-2 isolated from Tsuda kabu red turnips on cholesterol levels in cholesterol-administered rats.
AB  - In a previous in vitro study, we reported that the potential mechanism of the cholesterol-lowering effect of Lactobacillus brevis 119-2 isolated from turnip Tsuda kabu was the incorporation of cholesterol to cell membrane. In this study, we analyzed serum cholesterol and hepatic gene expression of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats kept on a cholesterol diet with or without L. brevis 119-2 for 2 weeks, to evaluate the cholesterol-lowering effect in vivo. Serum cholesterol levels were significantly reduced in SD rats kept on a diet including L. brevis 119-2 compared with that in SD rats kept on a diet without L. brevis 119-2, and both viable and dead L. brevis 119-2 induced this effect. Hepatic gene analysis by DNA microarray suggested that the potential mechanism of the cholesterol-lowering effect of L. brevis 119-2 in vivo was inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity by insulin induced gene (Insig) protein, and induction of catabolism of cholesterol to bile acid by Cyp7a1 (cytochrome P450 a1). In addition, we found that inclusion of L. brevis 119-2 in the diet decreased serum low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels by inducing overexpression of the LDL receptor gene. In contrast, Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 43121 increased high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by inducing overexpression of the ATP-binding cassette sub-family. A member 1 (Abca1) and Angiopoietin-like 3 (Angptl3) genes. These results suggest that L. brevis 119-2 decreases the risk of atherosclerosis by lowering serum cholesterol, ameliorating the effect of fatty liver.
TI  - Lactic acid bacterial extracts as anti-Helicobacter pylori: a molecular approach.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, the main cause of chronic  gastritis, increases gastric cancer risk. Antibiotics-based H. pylori eradication treatment is 90% effective. However, it is expensive and causes side effects and antibiotic resistance. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) could present a low-cost, large-scale alternative solution to prevent or decrease H. pylori colonization. AIM: This work aimed to study the inhibitory effects of LAB strains on the growth and pathogenic activity of H. pylori stains. To this end, we have selected the most virulent H. pylori strains (out of 20 mucosal antral biopsies) regarding cellular vacuolization and induction of apoptosis/necrosis. METHOD: The selection of H. pylori pathogenic strains (clinically pre-isolated) were based on their impact of VacA activities on Hep-2 cell line, induction of apoptosis and necrosis in Caco-2 cell line. The Inhibitory effect of LAB strains on the invasion was carried out using the Caco-2 and Hela cell lines, where, they were co-cultured with the pathogenic H. pylori in the presence or absence of LAB extracts. The effect of LAB extracts on TNF-alpha secretion which induced by H. pylori-LPS was carried out by RT-qPCR. RESULTS: L. bulgaricus DSMZ 20080, L. acidophilus and L. plantarum (studied previously and reported as high antioxidant candidate strains) showed the highest anti-pylori activities with inhibition ranged from 51.46 to 88.19%, they preventing the adhesion, invasion and DNA fragmentation of cell lines. In addition, they could reduce the TNF-alpha expression by 62.13%. CONCLUSION: LAB extracts could inhibit the bacterial adhesion and invasion, gastric inflammation and DNA fragmentation induced by Helicobacter pylori.
TI  - Effects of antibiotics on bacterial species composition and metabolic activities  in chemostats containing defined populations of human gut microorganisms.
AB  - The composition and metabolic activities of the human colonic microbiota are modulated by a number of external factors, including diet and antibiotic therapy. Changes in the structure and metabolism of the gut microbiota may have long-term consequences for host health. The large intestine harbors a complex microbial ecosystem comprising several hundreds of different bacterial species, which complicates investigations on intestinal physiology and ecology. To facilitate such studies, a highly simplified microbiota consisting of 14 anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic organisms (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Clostridium butyricum, C. perfringens, C. bifermentans, C. innocuum, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus) was used in this investigation. Ampicillin [9.2 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to two chemostats operated at different dilution rates (D; 0.10 h(-1) and 0.21 h(-1)), and metronidazole [76.9 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to a third vessel (D = 0.21 h(-1)). Perturbations in bacterial physiology and metabolism were sampled over a 48-h period. Lactobacillus acidophilus and C. bifermentans populations did not establish in the fermentors under the imposed growth conditions. Ampicillin resulted in substantial reductions in bacteroides and C. perfringens populations at both dilution rates. Metronidazole strongly affected bacteroides communities but had no effect on bifidobacterial communities. The bacteriostatic effect of ampicillin on bifidobacterial species was growth rate dependent. Several metabolic activities were affected by antibiotic addition, including fermentation product formation and enzyme synthesis. The growth of antibiotic-resistant bifidobacteria in the large bowel may enable them to occupy ecological niches left vacant after antibiotic administration, preventing colonization by pathogenic species.
TI  - Activities of free and encapsulated Lactobacillus acidophilus LA5 or Lactobacillus casei 01 in processed longan juices on exposure to simulated gastrointestinal tract.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fruit drinks containing probiotics are gaining interest in the global marketplace. For example, longan juice, containing carbohydrate and various bioactive components, is a potentially health-promoting beverage as well as probiotic carrier for human consumption. In this study, high-pressure and thermal processes were applied to eliminate competitive micro-organisms in longan juice prior to the addition of Lactobacillus acidophilus LA5 or Lactobacillus casei 01. The activities of these probiotics in a simulated gastrointestinal tract were also investigated. RESULTS: Encapsulated probiotics could survive in the acidic environment of the stomach and small intestine, while the free cells were completely eliminated. In the colon experiment, the influence of encapsulated L. casei 01 on colon lactobacilli was significantly greater than that of encapsulated L. acidophilus LA5. Both encapsulated probiotics suspended in processed longan juices led to extensive increases in the formation of lactic acid and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). Acetate was the major SCFA produced by colon bacteria, followed by propionate and butyrate. The discernible clear zone suggested that L. casei 01 provided greater antibacterial activity than L. acidophilus LA5. CONCLUSION: Both encapsulated probiotics along with processed longan juice led to significant increases in colon lactobacilli, lactic acid and SCFA formation.
TI  - Bioactivity of probiotic whey cheese: characterization of the content of peptides and organic acids.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotic whey cheeses have been produced for several years. It is recognized that several bacterium-mediated metabolic activities contribute differently to the final sensory and nutritional profiles of dairy products. Hence the metabolic activity of probiotic strains in a whey cheese and their contribution to the bioactivity of such matrices were investigated here, including in particular Bifidobacterium animalis, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei. RESULTS: Both L. casei and B. animalis produce lactic and acetic acids, whereas L. acidophilus produce mainly lactic acid; these metabolites may be considered bioprotection factors. Water-soluble extracts (WSE) obtained from these cheese matrices were subjected to ultrafiltration through a 3 kDa cut-off membrane, and the eluted peptides were resolved by high-performance liquid chromatography. Different qualitative and quantitative profiles were obtained, depending on the strain. WSE were further assayed for their ability to inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme; the <3 kDa fraction exhibited higher activities in the case of L. casei and B. animalis than the control and L. acidophilus. CONCLUSION: Whey cheeses with higher nutritional value were those inoculated with L. casei.
TI  - Effects of a simple or a complex starter microbiota on intestinal microbiota composition in caesarean derived piglets.
AB  - The present study was designed to develop a model in piglets that allows the investigation of the effects of postnatal association with a simple or a complex microbiota on gut health and development. Thirty piglets from 2 sows were obtained by caesarean delivery (day 0) and were equally divided over 2 treatment groups housed in separate clean, nonsterile rooms. All piglets received orally a simple microbiota consisting of Lactobacillus amylovorus, Clostridium glycolicum, and Parabacteroides spp. on days 1, 2, and 3 after birth. On day 3 and 4 the piglets received either a complex microbiota by providing them with a fecal inoculant of an adult sow [complex association (CA)] or a placebo inoculant [simple association (SA)]. Fecal microbiota composition, as determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and by pig intestinal tract chip (PITChip) analysis of 16S rRNA genes (days 3, 5, 7, 14, and 28), was less diverse in the SA group compared to the CA group. A difference in fecal microbiota composition between treatments persisted until the end of the study. It was concluded that the composition of microbiota in feces of cesarean delivery-derived piglets is influenced by bacterial association in the first days after birth. Differences in fecal microbiota composition between piglets exposed to a simple or complex inoculum at early age persisted for at least 3 wk.
TI  - Treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis with probiotics. A proof-of-concept study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics have profound effect on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in animal models. We aimed to test the hypothesis that probiotics treatment was superior to usual care in reducing liver fat in NASH patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with histology-proven NASH were randomized to receive probiotics (n = 10) or usual care (n = 10) for 6 months. The Lepicol probiotic formula contained Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus deslbrueckii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium bifidum. The primary endpoint was change in intrahepatic triglyceride content (IHTG), as measured by proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, from baseline to month 6. Secondary endpoints included changes in liver biochemistry and metabolic profile. RESULTS: IHTG decreased from 22.6 +/- 8.2% to 14.9 +/- 7.0% in the probiotic group (P = 0.034) but remained static in the usual care group (16.9 +/- 6.1% to 16.0 +/- 6.6%; P = 0.55). Six subjects in the probiotic group had IHTG reduced by more than 30% from baseline, compared to 2 subjects in the usual care group (P = 0.17). The probiotic group also had greater reduction in serum aspartate aminotransferase level (P = 0.008). On the other hand, the use of probiotics was not associated with changes in body mass index, waist circumference, glucose and lipid levels. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics treatment may reduce liver fat and AST level in NASH patients. The therapeutic potential of probiotics in NASH should be tested in larger studies.
TI  - Comparative in vitro inhibition of urinary tract pathogens by single- and multi-strain probiotics.
AB  - PURPOSE: Multi-species probiotic preparations have been suggested as having a wide spectrum of application, although few studies have compared their efficacy with that of individual component strains at equal concentrations. We therefore tested the ability of 4 single probiotics and 4 probiotic mixtures to inhibit the urinary tract pathogens Escherichia coli NCTC 9001 and Enterococcus faecalis NCTC 00775. METHODS: We used an agar spot test to test the ability of viable cells to inhibit pathogens, while a broth inhibition assay was used to assess inhibition by cell-free probiotic supernatants in both pH-neutralised and non-neutralised forms. RESULTS: In the agar spot test, all probiotic treatments showed inhibition, L. acidophilus was the most inhibitory single strain against E. faecalis, L. fermentum the most inhibitory against E. coli. A commercially available mixture of 14 strains (Bio-Kult((R))) was the most effective mixture, against E. faecalis, the 3-lactobacillus mixture the most inhibitory against E. coli. Mixtures were not significantly more inhibitory than single strains. In the broth inhibition assays, all probiotic supernatants inhibited both pathogens when pH was not controlled, with only 2 treatments causing inhibition at a neutral pH. CONCLUSIONS: Both viable cells of probiotics and supernatants of probiotic cultures were able to inhibit growth of two urinary tract pathogens. Probiotic mixtures prevented the growth of urinary tract pathogens but were not significantly more inhibitory than single strains. Probiotics appear to produce metabolites that are inhibitory towards urinary tract pathogens. Probiotics display potential to reduce the incidence of urinary tract infections via inhibition of colonisation.
TI  - Fermented milks and milk products as functional foods--a review.
AB  - Fermented foods and beverages possess various nutritional and therapeutic properties. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) play a major role in determining the positive health effects of fermented milks and related products. The L. acidophilus and Bifidobacteria spp are known for their use in probiotic dairy foods. Cultured products sold with any claim of health benefits should meet the criteria of suggested minimum number of more than 10(6) cfu/g at the time of consumption. Yoghurt is redefined as a probiotic carrier food. Several food powders like yoghurt powder and curd (dahi) powder are manufactured taking into consideration the number of organisms surviving in the product after drying. Such foods, beverages and powders are highly acceptable to consumers because of their flavor and aroma and high nutritive value. Antitumor activity is associated with the cell wall of starter bacteria and so the activity remains even after drying. Other health benefits of fermented milks include prevention of gastrointestinal infections, reduction of serum cholesterol levels and antimutagenic activity. The fermented products are recommended for consumption by lactose intolerant individuals and patients suffering from atherosclerosis. The formulation of fermented dietetic preparations and special products is an expanding research area. The health benefits, the technology of production of fermented milks and the kinetics of lactic acid fermentation in dairy products are reviewed here.
TI  - Tailoring gut immune responses with lipoteichoic acid-deficient Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - As highlighted by the development of intestinal autoinflammatory disorders when tolerance is lost, homeostatic interactions between gut microbiota, resident immune cells, and the gut epithelium are key in the maintenance of gastrointestinal health. Gut immune responses, whether stimulatory or regulatory, are dictated by the activated dendritic cells (DCs) that first interact with microorganisms and their gene products to then elicit T and B cell responses. Previously, we have demonstrated that treatment with genetically modified Lactobacillus acidophilus is sufficient to tilt the immune balance from proinflammatory to regulatory in experimental models of colitis and colon cancer. Given the significant role of DCs in efficiently orchestrating intestinal immune responses, characterization of the signals induced within these cells by the surface layer molecules, such as lipoteichoic acid (LTA), and proteins of L. acidophilus is critical for future treatment and prevention of gastrointestinal diseases. Here, we discuss the potential regulatory pathways involved in the downregulation of pathogenic inflammation in the gut, and explore questions regarding the immune responses to LTA-deficient L. acidophilus that require future studies.
TI  - Alterations in fecal Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species in type 2 diabetic patients in Southern China population.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The connection between gut microbiota and metabolism and its role in  the pathogenesis of diabetes are increasingly recognized. The objective of this study was to quantitatively measure Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species, members of commensal bacteria found in human gut, in type 2 diabetic patients (T2D) patients from Southern China. METHODS: Fifty patients with T2D and thirty control individuals of similar body mass index (BMI) were recruited from Southern China. T2D and control subjects were confirmed with both oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and HbA(1c) measurements. Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species in feces were measured by real-time quantitative PCR. Data were analyzed with STATA 11.0 statistical software. RESULTS: In comparison to control subjects T2D patients had significantly more total Lactobacillus (+18%), L. bugaricus (+13%), L. rhamnosum (+37%) and L. acidophilus (+48%) (P < 0.05). In contrast, T2D patients had less amounts of total Bifidobacteria (-7%) and B. adolescentis (-12%) (P < 0.05). Cluster analysis showed that gut microbiota pattern of T2D patients is characterized by greater numbers of L. rhamnosus and L. acidophillus, together with lesser numbers of B. adolescentis (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The gut microflora in T2D patients is characterized by greater numbers of Lactobacillus and lesser numbers of Bifidobacterium species.
TI  - Probiotics Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus acidophilus suppresses DMH-induced procarcinogenic fecal enzymes and preneoplastic aberrant crypt foci in early colon carcinogenesis in Sprague Dawley rats.
AB  - Diet makes an important contribution to colorectal cancer (CRC) risk implying risks for CRC are potentially reducible. Therefore, the probiotics have been suggested as the prophylactic measure in colon cancer. In this study, different probiotics were used to compare their protective potential against 1,2 dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride (DMH)-induced chemical colon carcinogenesis in Sprague Dawley rats. Animals belonging to different probiotic groups were fed orally with 1 x 10(9) lactobacilli daily for 1 week, and then a weekly injection of DMH was given intraperitoneally for 6 wks with daily administration of probiotic. Lactobacillus GG and L.acidophilus + DMH-treated animals had maximum percent reduction in ACF counts. A significant decrease (P < 0.05) in fecal nitroreductase activity was observed in L.casei + DMH and L.plantarum + DMH-treated rats whereas beta-glucuronidase activity decreased in L.GG + DMH and L.acidophilus + DMH-treated rats. Animals treated with Bifidobacterium bifidum + DMH had significant decreased beta-glucosidase activity. However, not much difference was observed in the colon morphology of animals belonging to various probiotic + DMH-treated rats compared with DMH-treated alone. The results indicated that probiotics, L.GG, and L.acidophilus can be used as the better prophylactic agents for experimental colon carcinogenesis.
TI  - Probiotic-mediated competition, exclusion and displacement in biofilm formation by food-borne pathogens.
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the inhibitory effect of probiotic strains on pathogenic biofilm formation in terms of competition, exclusion and displacement. Probiotic strains (Lactobacillus acidophilus KACC 12419, Lact. casei KACC 12413, Lact. paracasei KACC 12427 and Lact. rhamnosus KACC 11953) and pathogens (Salmonella Typhimurium KCCM 40253 and Listeria monocytogenes KACC 12671) were used to evaluate the auto-aggregation, hydrophobicity and biofilm formation inhibition. The highest auto-aggregation abilities were observed in Lact. rhamnosus (17.5%), Lact. casei (17.2%) and Lact. acidophilus (15.1%). Salm. Typhimurium had the highest affinity to xylene, showing the hydrophobicity of 53.7%. The numbers of L. monocytogenes biofilm cells during the competition, exclusion and displacement assays were effectively reduced by more than 3 log when co-cultured with Lact. paracasei and Lact. rhamnosus. The results suggest that probiotic strains can be used as alternative way to effectively reduce the biofilm formation in pathogenic bacteria through competition, exclusion and displacement.
TI  - Effects of selenium-enriched probiotics on heat shock protein mRNA levels in piglet under heat stress conditions.
AB  - The effects of selenium-enriched probiotics (SP) on tissue selenium (Se) deposition, glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx1) activity and mRNA level, and heat shock protein (Hsp) mRNA levels of piglets under heat stress conditions were investigated. A total of 48 crossbred ([Landrace x Yorkshire] x Duroc) piglets were randomly divided into 4 groups and fed a basal diet (Con, 0.16 mg Se/kg) or basal diets with added probiotics (P, 0.16 mg Se/kg), sodium selenite (SS, 0.46 mg Se/kg), or SP (0.46 mg Se/kg), respectively, for 42 days. Three piglets were randomly selected from each group for blood sample collection at days 0, 14, 28, and 42 and for liver, kidney, and spleen sample collection at day 42. The results showed that P, SS, and SP could significantly down-regulate the average mRNA levels of Hsp70 (17.3, 23.7, and 40.1%) and Hsp27 (22.4, 24.4, and 44.7%) of the tissues, respectively (P < 0.05), whereas SS and SP could significantly elevate Se concentration, GPx1 activity and mRNA level (P < 0.05). The maximal effects of these parameters were observed in SP. It was concluded that SP is a feasible dietary supplementation of piglets under heat stress conditions during the summer season.
TI  - Effect of drying methods of microencapsulated Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris on secondary protein structure and glass transition temperature as studied by Fourier transform infrared and differential scanning calorimetry.
AB  - Protective mechanisms of casein-based microcapsules containing mannitol on Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris, changes in their secondary protein structures, and glass transition of the microcapsules were studied after spray- or freeze-drying and after 10 wk of storage in aluminum foil pouches containing different desiccants (NaOH, LiCl, or silica gel) at 25 degrees C. An in situ Fourier transform infrared analysis was carried out to recognize any changes in fatty acids (FA) of bacterial cell envelopes, interaction between polar site of cell envelopes and microcapsules, and alteration of their secondary protein structures. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to determine glass transition of microcapsules based on glass transition temperature (T(g)) values. Hierarchical cluster analysis based on functional groups of cell envelopes and secondary protein structures was also carried out to classify the microencapsulated bacteria due to the effects of spray- or freeze-drying and storage for 10 wk. The results showed that drying process did not affect FA and secondary protein structures of bacteria; however, those structures were affected during storage depending upon the type of desiccant used. Interaction between exterior of bacterial cell envelopes and microencapsulant occurred after spray- or freeze-drying; however, these structures were maintained after storage in foil pouch containing sodium hydroxide. Method of drying and type of desiccants influenced the level of similarities of microencapsulated bacteria. Desiccants and method of drying affected glass transition, yet no T(g) </=25 degrees C was detected. This study demonstrated that the changes in FA and secondary structures of the microencapsulated bacteria still occurred during storage at T(g) above room temperature, indicating that the glassy state did not completely prevent chemical activities.
TI  - An oral preparation of Lactobacillus acidophilus for the treatment of uncomplicated acute watery diarrhoea in Vietnamese children: study protocol for a multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diarrhoeal disease is a major global health problem, particularly affecting children under the age of 5 years. Besides oral rehydration solution, probiotics are also commonly prescribed to children with acute watery diarrhoea in some settings. Results from randomised clinical trials (RCTs) in which investigators studied the effect of probiotics on diarrhoeal symptoms have largely shown a positive effect; yet, the overall quality of the data is limited. In Vietnam, probiotics are the most frequently prescribed treatment for children hospitalised with acute watery diarrhoea, but there is little justification for this treatment in this location. We have designed a RCT to test the hypothesis that an oral preparation of Lactobacillus acidophilus is superior to placebo in the treatment of acute watery diarrhoea in Vietnamese children. METHODS: This RCT was designed to study the effect of treatment with L. acidophilus (4 x 109 colony-forming units/day) for 5 days for acute watery diarrhoea against a placebo in 300 children ages 9 to 60 months admitted to hospitals in Vietnam. Clinical and laboratory data plus samples will be collected on admission, daily during hospitalisation, at discharge, and at follow-up visits for a subset of participants. The primary end point will be defined as the time from the first dose of study medication to the start of the first 24-hour period without diarrhoea as assessed by the on-duty nurse. Secondary endpoints include the time to cessation of diarrhoea as recorded by parents or guardians in an hourly checklist, stool frequency over the first 3 days, treatment failure, rotavirus and norovirus viral loads, and adverse events. DISCUSSION: The existing evidence for the use of probiotics in treating acute watery diarrhoea seems to favour their use. However, the size of the effect varies across publications. An array of different probiotic organisms, doses, treatment durations, study populations, designs, settings, and aetiologies have been described. In this trial, we will investigate whether probiotics are beneficial as an adjuvant treatment for children with acute watery diarrhoea in Vietnam, with the aim of guiding clinical practice through improved regional evidence. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN88101063.
TI  - Ultra-low-dose estriol and lactobacilli in the local treatment of postmenopausal  vaginal atrophy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy of an ultra-low-dose vaginal estriol 0.03 mg in combination with viable Lactobacillus acidophilus KS400 (Gynoflor((R)) vaginal tablets) in the short-term therapy and to investigate the long-term maintenance dose in the treatment of vaginal atrophy. METHODS: This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study (Controlled phase--initial therapy) followed by an open-label follow-up (Open phase--test medication initial and maintenance therapy). Included were postmenopausal women with vaginal atrophy symptoms and Vaginal Maturation Index (VMI) of </= 40%. The method of treatment was initial therapy with test medication (or placebo in first phase), one vaginal tablet daily for 12 days, followed by maintenance therapy, one tablet on two consecutive days weekly for 12 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 87 women completed the study. The Controlled phase results for a change in VMI demonstrated superiority of the 0.03 mg estriol-lactobacilli combination to placebo (p < 0.001). In the test group, the positive change in VMI was 35.2%, compared to 9.9% in the placebo group. In the Open phase after the initial therapy, the VMI was increased to 55.4% and, during maintenance therapy, it stayed at a comparable level (52.8-49.4%). The maturation of epithelium was followed by improvement of clinical symptoms and normalization of the vaginal ecosystem. CONCLUSIONS: The ultra-low-dose, vaginal 0.03 mg estriol-lactobacilli combination (Gynoflor((R))) was superior to placebo with respect to changes in VMI after the 12-day initial therapy, and the maintenance therapy of two tablets weekly was sufficient to prevent the relapse of vaginal atrophy.
TI  - Enzymatic depolymerization of gum tragacanth: bifidogenic potential of low molecular weight oligosaccharides.
AB  - Gum tragacanth derived from the plant "goat's horn" (Astragalus sp.) has a long history of use as a stabilizing, viscosity-enhancing agent in food emulsions. The gum contains pectinaceous arabinogalactans and fucose-substituted xylogalacturonans. In this work, gum tragacanth from Astragalus gossypinus was enzymatically depolymerized using Aspergillus niger pectinases (Pectinex BE Color). The enzymatically degraded products were divided into three molecular weight fractions via membrane separation: HAG1 < 2 kDa; 2 kDa < HAG2 < 10 kDa; HAG3 > 10 kDa. Compositional and linkage analyses showed that these three fractions also varied with respect to composition and structural elements: HAG1 and HAG2 were enriched in arabinose, galactose, and galacturonic acid, but low in fucose and xylose, whereas HAG3 was high in (terminal) xylose, fucose, and 1,4-bonded galacturonic acid, but low in arabinose and galactose content. The growth-stimulating potential of the three enzymatically produced gum tragacanth fractions was evaluated via growth assessment on seven different probiotic strains in single-culture fermentations on Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum (two strains), B. longum subsp. infantis (three strains), Lactobacillus acidophilus , B. lactis, and on one pathogenic strain of Clostridium perfringens . The fractions HAG1 and HAG2 consistently promoted higher growth of the probiotic strains than HAG3, especially of the three B. longum subsp. infantis strains, and the growth promotion on HAG1 and HAG2 was better than that on galactan (control). HAG3 completely inhibited the growth of the C. perfringens strain. Tragacanth gum is thus a potential source of prebiotic carbohydrates that exert no viscosity effects and which may find use as natural functional food ingredients.
TI  - Antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  - Previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (bLf), but the results are inconsistent. Moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-bLf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield bLf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-bLf. However, whether bLf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. Therefore, various probiotic strains in Taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate in vitro. Thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356, Lactobacillus salivarius ATCC 11741, Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 53103, Bifidobacterium longum ATCC 15707, and Bifidobacterium lactis BCRC 17394 were inhibited by both apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate. The growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate, including L. rhamnosus ATCC 7469, Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC 23272, Lactobacillus fermentum ATCC 11739, Lactobacillus coryniformis ATCC 25602, L. acidophilus BCRC 14065, Bifidobacterium infantis ATCC 15697, Bifidobacterium bifidum ATCC 29521, and Pediococcus acidilactici ATCC 8081. However, apo-bLf and its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. Moreover, the supernatants produced by L. fermentum, B. lactis, and B. longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. Importantly, a combination of apo-bLf or bLf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. In conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-bLf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.
TI  - In-vitro activity of saponins of bauhinia purpurea, madhuca longifolia, celastrus paniculatus and semecarpus anacardium on selected oral pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Dental caries, periodontitis and other mucosal diseases are caused by  a complex community of microorganisms. This study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial properties of saponins of four important oil yielding medicinal plant extracts on selected oral pathogens that are involved in such diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Saponins were extracted from Bauhinia purpurea, Madhuca longifolia, Celastrus paniculatus and Semecarpus anacardium and purified. Antimicrobial properties of these saponins against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus salivarius, Staphylococcus aureus and Lactobacillus acidophilus were determined using well diffusion method. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined as the lowest concentration of saponins inhibiting bacterial growth after 14 h of incubation at 37 degrees C. The bactericidal activity was evaluated using the viable cell count method. RESULTS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of Madhuca longifolia saponin on Streptococcus mutans MTCC 890, Streptococcus mitis and Staphylococcus aureus was 18.3 +/- 0.15/34.4 +/- 0.24 mug/ml, 19.0 +/- 0.05/32.2 +/- 0.0 mug/ml and 21.2 +/- 0.35/39.0 +/- 0.30 mug/ml, respectively and Bauhinia purpurea saponin on Streptococcus mutans MTCC 890, Staphylococcus aureus and Lactobacillus acidophilus was 26.4 +/- 0.20/43.0 +/- 0.40 mug/ml, 29.0 +/- 0.30/39.6 +/- 0.12 mug/ml and 20.2 +/- 0.05/36.8 +/- 0.23 mug/ml, respectively. CONCLUSION: The strong antimicrobial activity of Madhuca longifolia and Bauhinia purpurea may be due to the presence of complex triterpenoid saponins, oleanane type triterpenoid glycosides or atypical pentacyclic triterpenoid saponin. Hence, these extracted saponins may be used in food and oral products to prevent and control oral diseases.
TI  - Exploring the ameliorative potential of probiotic Dahi containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum on dextran sodium sulphate induced colitis in mice.
AB  - Conventional medical therapies for ulcerative colitis (UC) are still limited due  to the adverse side effects like dose-dependent diarrhoea and insufficient potency to keep in remission for long-term periods. So, new alternatives that provide more effective and safe therapies for ulcerative colitis are constantly being sought. In the present study, probiotic LaBb Dahi was selected for investigation of its therapeutic effect on DSS-induced colitis model in mice. LaBb Dahi was prepared by co-culturing Dahi culture of Lactococci along with selected strain of Lactobacillus acidophilus LaVK2 and Bifidobacterium bifidum BbVK3 in buffalo milk. Four groups of mice (12 each) were fed for 17 d with buffalo milk (normal control), buffalo milk plus DSS (Colitis control), Dahi plus DSS, and LaBb Dahi plus DSS, respectively, with basal diet. The disease activity scores, weight loss, organ weight, colon length, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and beta-glucoronidase activity was assessed, and the histopathological picture of the colon of mice was studied. All colitis control mice evidenced significant increase in MPO, beta-glucoronidase activity and showed high disease activity scores along with histological damage to colonic tissue. Feeding with LaBb Dahi offered significant reduction in MPO activity, beta-glucoronidase activity and improved disease activity scores. We found significant decline in length of colon, organ weight and body weight in colitis induced controls which were improved significantly by feeding LaBb Dahi. The present study suggests that LaBb Dahi can be used as a potential nutraceutical intervention to combat UC related changes and may offer effective adjunctive treatment for management of UC.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus strain suppresses the transcription of proinflammatory-related factors in human HT-29 cells.
AB  - Previous studies have shown that lactic acid bacteria can inhibit inflammatory responses, but the mechanisms are very little known. In this study, transaction and expression of three proinflammatory factors, iNOS, PTGS-2, and IL8, which are closely related to the inflammatory response, were investigated by luciferase reporter assay and RTPCR in HT-29 cells treated by Lactobacillus acidophilus. The results showed that the live L. acidophilus sharply down-regulated the transcription of these three genes. Because there was a NF-kappaB binding site located at -265 bp, -225 bp, and -95 bp upstream of the iNOS, PTGS-2, and IL8 promoters, respectively, we further addressed the effects of NF-kappaB on transaction of the three promoters by cotransfection. As was expected, NF-kappaBs remarkably upregulated the activity of the reporter gene and, no effect of NF-kappaBs on IL-8 promoter transaction was found after NF-kappaB binding site mutation of the IL8 promoter in HT-29 cells. In conclusion, the live L. acidophilus decreased the transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB and, in turn, inhibited the transaction of NF-kappaB on the three proinflammatory factors mentioned above.
TI  - [Probiotic supplement (Lactobacillus acidophilus and bulgaricus) utility in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a very common functional condition  and a frequent cause of consultation in gastroenterology. With a multifactorial pathophysiology IBS is characterized by abdominal pain, distension and altered bowel habits. Loperamide, antispasmodics and antidepressants are symptomatic relievers of this disorder. Recently probiotics were incorporated to therapy, and could improve the symptomatology. METHODS: multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial that included IBS patients, diagnosed with Rome III criteria. The patients were given pinaverium bromure and placebo or pinaverium bromure and probiotics for 3 weeks. The intensity of symptoms and the effect of therapy were evaluated with the Francis Score, before and after the treatment. Statistics were done with SPSS 12.0 (C.I 95%). RESULTS: 51 patients were evaluated, with an average age of 43 years old, mostly mestizo, 75% (38) married and 55% (28) female. There were statistical differences in four variables: abdominal pain, intensity of pain, days of pain and total score at the end of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics used as supplement are effective in improving symptomatology of IBS.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria convert human fibroblasts to multipotent cells.
AB  - The human gastrointestinal tract is colonized by a vast community of symbionts and commensals. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) form a group of related, low-GC-content, gram-positive bacteria that are considered to offer a number of probiotic benefits to general health. While the role of LAB in gastrointestinal microecology has been the subject of extensive study, little is known about how commensal prokaryotic organisms directly influence eukaryotic cells. Here, we demonstrate the generation of multipotential cells from adult human dermal fibroblast cells by incorporating LAB. LAB-incorporated cell clusters are similar to embryoid bodies derived from embryonic stem cells and can differentiate into endodermal, mesodermal, and ectodermal cells in vivo and in vitro. LAB-incorporated cell clusters express a set of genes associated with multipotency, and microarray analysis indicates a remarkable increase of NANOG, a multipotency marker, and a notable decrease in HOX gene expression in LAB-incorporated cells. During the cell culture, the LAB-incorporated cell clusters stop cell division and start to express early senescence markers without cell death. Thus, LAB-incorporated cell clusters have potentially wide-ranging implications for cell generation, reprogramming, and cell-based therapy.
TI  - Effect of probiotic strains of lacto- and bifidobacteria on the activity of macrophages and other parameters of immunity in cases of staphylococcosis.
AB  - The immunomodulatory properties of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus IMVB-7281, Lactobacillus casei IMV B-7280, Lactobacillus acidophilus IMV B-7279, Bifidobacterium animales VKL and B. animales VKB strains on the models of experimental staphylococcosis infection in mice were determined. It was found that after the mice, infected with staphylococcus, were treated by some probiotic strains of lacto- and bifidobacteria, a normalization of functional activity of phagoctic cells system and increase of the endogenous interferon production were observed. L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus IMVB-7281, L. casei IMVB-7280, L. acidophilus IMV B-7279, B. animales VKB and B. animales VKL are promising for the development of probiotics, effective against staphylococci and for the immunity correction.
TI  - The effect of lacto- and bifidobacteria compositions on the vaginal microflora in cases of intravaginal staphylococcosis.
AB  - The effect of intravaginal injection of Lactobacillus casei IMV B-7280, Lactobacillus acidophilus IMV B-7279, Bifidobacterium animalis VKL and Bifidobacterium animalis VKB strains in various compositions on the range of microflora of the urogenital tract on the model of experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis of mice was determined. It was established that under the influence of various compositions of these strains changes in microflora spectrum occurred the number of representatives of normoflora increased and the number of pathogenic microorganisms, including staphylococci, streptococci, coliform bacteria and fungi, significantly decreased. It was determined that strains of lacto- and bifidobacteria, that were studied, are prospective components of future probiotic drugs efficient in treating staphylococcosis.
TI  - Assessment of the effect of probiotic curd consumption on salivary pH and streptococcus mutans counts.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial methods of controlling dental caries that include probiotic agents can play a valuable role in establishing caries control in children at moderate to high risk for developing dental caries. Several studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of use of various Probiotic products including curd. The objective of this study was to compare the effect of short-term consumption of probiotic curd containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and normal curd on salivary Streptococcus Mutans counts, as well as salivary pH. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty, caries-free, 10-12 years old children were selected and randomly allocated to two groups. Test Group consisted of 20 children who consumed 200ml of probiotic curd daily for 30 days. Control Group consisted of 20 children who were given 200ml of regular curd for 30 days. Salivary pH and salivary Streptococcus Mutans counts were recorded at baseline and after 30 days and statistically compared using the Student's t-test. RESULTS: Consumption of probiotic curd resulted in a statistically significant reduction in S. Mutans colony counts (P<0.001) as compared to regular curd. However, there was a slight reduction in pH (P>0.05) in both the groups. CONCLUSION: Short-term consumption of probiotic curds can reduce oral S. Mutans counts. However, this caused a slight reduction in salivary pH.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus on Helicobacter hepaticus in vitro.
AB  - Helicobacter hepaticus and Helicobacter pylori both belong to Helicobacter species. Strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, including L4 and L6, have shown significant inhibitory effects on H. pylori. Based on this phenomenon, we aim to investigate the inhibitory effect of L. acidophilus on H. hepaticus. Both standard and isolated H. hepaticus strains were grown under microaerophilic conditions at 37 degrees C in the presence of L. acidophilus supernatant, or lactic acid. The diameters of the inhibition zones were measured on the solid culture media. In liquid culture, the cell concentrations were measured and the urease activity was determined by phenol red staining. Sixteen strains of L. acidophilus isolated from human feces (named as L1-L16) showed anti-H. hepaticus effects. Two of them (L4 and L6) exhibited the most apparent effects on H. hepaticus inhibition. The L. acidophilus supernatant of L4 and L6 significantly increased the diameters of the inhibition zones compared with that of the lactic acid control (P < 0.05). The inhibitory role of L. acidophilus supernatant was independent of the pH value of solution (P > 0.05). Moreover, in liquid culture, L. acidophilus supernatant significantly reduced the cell growth rate and the urease activity of H. hepaticus cells in a time-dependent pattern (P < 0.05 compared with lactic acid control). No obvious difference was observed between the standard and isolated strain of H. hepaticus (P > 0.05). Our results indicate that L. acidophilus can decrease the viability and urease activity of H. hepaticus in vitro and this inhibition is independent of pH levels. This provides evidence for developing novel approaches for the prevention and treatment of H. hepaticus infection.
TI  - Zinc uptake by lactic Acid bacteria.
AB  - The study aims to investigate zinc biosorption by strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria with a view to exploit them as organic matrixes for zinc dietary supplementation. Sixteen human strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium were assayed for zinc uptake. The minimum inhibitory concentration of zinc salts differed among the strains, but was never below 15 mmol L(-1). When cultured in MRS broth containing 10 mmol L(-1) ZnSO4, all the strains were capable of accumulating zinc in the range between 11 and 135 mumol g(-1). The highest amount of cell-bound zinc was obtained in L. acidophilus WC 0203. pH-controlled batch cultures of this strain revealed that zinc uptake started in the growth phase, but occurred mostly during the stationary phase. Pasteurized and viable cultures accumulated similar amount of zinc, suggesting that a nonmetabolically mediated mechanism is involved in zinc uptake. These results provide new perspectives on the specific use of probiotics, since L. acidophilus WC 0203 could function as an organic matrix for zinc incorporation. The bioavailability of Lactobacillus-bound zinc deserves to be investigated to provide a future basis for optimization of zinc supplementation or fortification.
TI  - Development of the gut microbiota in southern Indian infants from birth to 6 months: a molecular analysis.
AB  - Acquisition of the gastrointestinal microbiota at birth may have long-term health impacts. We longitudinally characterised major microbial communities in the faeces of a cohort of infants using molecular methods. Faecal samples were prospectively obtained at several time points after birth from eighty-three infants. Real-time PCR using SYBR green and primers targeted at 16S rRNA gene sequences were used to quantify Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus acidophilus group, Bacteroides-Prevotella group, Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus, Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale group, Clostridium leptum group and Staphylococcus. Microbial community abundance was expressed relative to amplification of sequences conserved universally for domain bacteria. Faecal copy number of 16S rRNA genes increased non-significantly from a mean of 4.1 x 10(9)/g on day 1 to 1.1 x 10(10)/g on day 4. All microbial communities were detected from day 1 after birth. Enterobacteriaceae and lactobacilli predominated on day 1, while bifidobacteria and staphylocci increased on day 4. Bacteroides-Prevotella and C. coccoides-E. rectale increased by day 180. C. leptum was detected in half of the cohort at birth and in a slightly larger percentage by 6 months. Caesarean section was associated with delayed colonisation by several bacterial communities. Higher socio-economic status was associated with more abundant lactobacilli and Bacteroides-Prevotella at 90 and 180 d. Supplemental feeding was associated with a reduction in Enterobacteriaceae. Microbial colonisation of the gut was well established on the first day of birth, and relative abundance of microbial communities was influenced by mode of delivery, socio-economic status and supplemental feeding. These findings may have relevance to infant nutrition and growth.
TI  - Comparison of Yacon (Smallanthus sonchifolius) Tuber with Commercialized Fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) in Terms of Physiology, Fermentation Products and Intestinal Microbial Communities in Rats.
AB  - The yacon (Smallanthus sonchifolius) tuber was examined with regard to its prebiotic effects compared with commercialized fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS). A feed containing 10% yacon tuber, which is equivalent to 5% commercialized FOS in terms of the amount of fructo-oligosaccharides (GF2, GF3 and GF4), was administrated to rats for 28 days. The yacon diet changed the intestinal microbial communities beginning in the first week, resulting in a twofold greater concentration of cecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). The SCFA composition differed, but the cecal pH in rats fed yacon tuber was equal to that in rats fed FOS. Serum triglycerides were lower in rats fed yacon compared with rats fed FOS and the control diet. Cecal size was greater with the yacon tuber diet compared with the control diet. The abundant fermentation in the intestines created a selective environment for the intestinal microbiota, which included Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, Bifidobacterium animalis and Barnesiella spp. according to identification with culture-independent analysis, 16S rRNA gene PCR-DGGE combined with cloning and sequencing. Barnesiella spp. and B. pseudolongum were only found in the rats fed the yacon diet, while L. acidophilus and B. animalis were found in abundance in rats fed both the yacon and FOS diets. The genus Barnesiella has not previously been reported to be associated with yacon or FOS fermentation. We concluded that the physiological and microbiological effects of the yacon tuber were different from those of FOS. Differences in cecal size, blood triglycerides and microbial community profiles including their metabolites (SCFAs) between the yacon tuber and FOS were shown to be more greatly affected by the yacon tuber rather than FOS.
TI  - Investigation of inpatient probiotic use at an academic medical center.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Despite the widespread use of probiotics, there are limited data regarding their safety. The aims of this study were to characterize inpatient probiotic use and to determine the incidence of probiotic-related bloodstream infections due to Lactobacillus acidophilus/Lactobacillus bulgaricus. METHODS: This study was a two-part retrospective study conducted at a large academic medical center. The first part was the characterization of probiotic use during 2007-2008, which included the type of prescribing provider, choice of probiotic prescribed, indications for use, and presence of potential risk factors for probiotic infection among recipients; the second part was the determination of the incidence of probiotic-related bloodstream infections due to L. acidophilus/L. bulgaricus for September 2000-August 2008. RESULTS: Probiotic use was uncommon (0.4%). Ninety-six percent of patients received Lactobacillus-based compounds. Use was common in patients at theoretical risk for probiotic infection. The maximum estimated incidence of probiotic-related bacteremia due to L. acidophilus/L. bulgaricus during the 8-year period was 0.2%. CONCLUSIONS: L. acidophilus/L. bulgaricus probiotic use at our institution appeared to be associated with a minimal risk of probiotic-related infection, even though it was used at a high frequency among inpatients who could be considered at high theoretical risk for probiotic-related bloodstream infection.
TI  - Effects of different fermentation parameters on quality characteristics of kefir.
AB  - The main objective of the study was to determine the effects of different fermentation parameters on kefir quality. Kefir samples were produced using kefir grains or natural kefir starter culture, and fermentation was carried out under normal or modified atmosphere (10% CO(2)) conditions. The microbiological (lactobacilli, lactococci, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium spp., and yeasts), chemical (pH, lactic acid, total solids, protein, ethanol, exopolysaccharide contents), rheological, and sensory properties of kefir samples were investigated during a 21-d storage period. The use of different fermentation parameters or the choice of grain versus natural kefir starter culture did not significantly affect the content of microorganisms. Lactobacilli, lactococci, and yeast contents of kefir samples varied between 9.21 and 9.28, 9.23 and 9.29, and 4.71 and 5.53 log cfu/mL, respectively, on d 1 of storage. Contents of L. acidophilus and Bifidobacterium spp. were between 5.78 and 6.43 and between 3.19 and 6.14 log cfu/mL, respectively, during 21 d of storage. During the storage period, pH, lactic acid (%), total solids (%), protein (%), acetaldehyde, and ethanol contents of kefir samples ranged from 4.29 to 4.53, from 0.81 to 0.95%, from 7.81 to 8.21%, from 3.09 to 3.48%, from 3.8 to 23.6 mg/L, and from 76.5 to 5,147 mg/L, respectively. The exopolysaccharide contents of the samples decreased during 21 d of cold storage; the samples fermented under modified atmosphere had relatively higher exopolysaccharide contents, indicating higher potential therapeutic properties. The kefir samples exhibited non-Newtonian pseudoplastic flow behavior according to the power law model. According to the sensory results, kefir produced from natural kefir starter culture under CO(2) atmosphere had the highest overall evaluation score at d 1.
TI  - The effect of a multispecies synbiotic mixture on the duration of diarrhea and length of hospital stay in children with acute diarrhea in Turkey: single blinded randomized study.
AB  - Probiotics have been successfully used for the treatment of acute diarrhea in children and this effect depends on the strains and dose. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of a synbiotic mixture on the duration of diarrhea and the length of hospital stay in children with acute watery diarrhea. This is a prospective randomized, multicenter single blinded clinical trial in hospitalized children with acute watery diarrhea. All children were treated with conventional hydration therapy with or without a daily dose of a synbiotic (2.5 x 10(9) CFU live bacteria including Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum, Enterococcus faecium, and 625 mg fructooligosaccharide) for 5 days. The primary endpoint was duration of diarrhea and duration of hospitalization was the secondary endpoint. Among 209 eligible children, 113 received the synbiotic mixture and 96 served as a control. The duration of diarrhea was significantly shorter ( approximately 36 h) in children receiving the synbiotic group than the controls (77.9 +/- 30.5 vs. 114.6 +/- 37.4 h, p < 0.0001). The duration of hospitalization was shorter in children receiving the synbiotic group (4.94 +/- 1.7 vs. 5.77 +/- 1.97 days, p = 0.002). The effect of synbiotic mixture on diarrhea started after 24th hours and stool frequency significantly decreased after 24th and 48th hours. The percentage of diarrhea-free children is significantly higher in synbiotic group at 48th and 72nd hours of synbiotic group. In conclusion, this study showed a reduction in diarrhea duration by approximately 36 h and a reduction in the duration of hospitalization with approximately 1 day in children with acute diarrhea with this synbiotic mixture.
TI  - Real-time analysis of metabolic activity within Lactobacillus acidophilus by phasor fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy of NADH.
AB  - Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) is an endogenous fluorescent molecule commonly used as a metabolic biomarker. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) is a method in which the fluorescence decay is measured at each pixel of an image. While the fluorescence spectrum of free and protein-bound NADH is very similar, free and protein-bound NADH display very different decay profiles. Therefore, FLIM can provide a way to distinguish free/bound NADH at the level of single bacteria within biological samples. The phasor technique is a graphical method to analyse the entire image and to produce a histogram of pixels with different decay profile. In this study, NADH fluorescence decay profiles within Lactobacillus acidophilus samples treated using different protocols indicated discernible variations. Clear distinctions between fluorescence decay profiles of NADH in samples of artificially heightened metabolic activity in comparison to those of samples lacking an accessible carbon source were obtained.
TI  - Hypolipidemic effects of lactic acid bacteria fermented cereal in rats.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objectives of the present study were to investigate the efficacy  of the mixed culture of Lactobacillus acidophilus (DSM 20242), Bifidobacterium bifidum (DSM 20082) and Lactobacillus helveticus (CK60) in the fermentation of maize and the evaluation of the effect of the fermented meal on the lipid profile of rats. METHODS: Rats were randomly assigned to 3 groups and each group placed on a Diet A (high fat diet into which a maize meal fermented with a mixed culture of Lb acidophilus (DSM 20242), B bifidum (DSM 20082) and Lb helveticus (CK 60) was incorporated), B (unfermented high fat diet) or C (commercial rat chow) respectively after the first group of 7 rats randomly selected were sacrificed to obtain the baseline data. Thereafter 7 rats each from the experimental and control groups were sacrificed weekly for 4 weeks and the plasma, erythrocytes, lipoproteins and organs of the rats were assessed for cholesterol, triglyceride and phospholipids. RESULTS: Our results revealed that the mixed culture of Lb acidophilus (DSM 20242), B bifidum (DSM 20082) and Lb helveticus (CK 60) were able to grow and ferment maize meal into 'ogi' of acceptable flavour. In addition to plasma and hepatic hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia, phospholipidosis in plasma, as well as cholesterogenesis, triglyceride constipation and phospholipidosis in extra-hepatic tissues characterized the consumption of unfermented hyperlipidemic diets. However, feeding the animals with the fermented maize diet reversed the dyslipidemia. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study indicate that consumption of mixed culture lactic acid bacteria (Lb acidophilus (DSM 20242), Bifidobacterium bifidum (DSM 20082) and Lb helveticus (CK 60) fermented food results in the inhibition of fat absorption. It also inhibits the activity of HMG CoA reductase. This inhibition may be by feedback inhibition or repression of the transcription of the gene encoding the enzyme via activation of the sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) transcription factor. It is also possible that consumption of fermented food enhances conversion of cholesterol to bile acids by activating cholesterol-7alpha-hydroxylase.
TI  - Metabolism of biodiesel-derived glycerol in probiotic Lactobacillus strains.
AB  - Three probiotic Lactobacillus strains, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii, were tested for their ability to assimilate and metabolize glycerol. Biodiesel-derived glycerol was used as the main carbon and energy source in batch microaerobic growth. Here, we show that the tested strains were able to assimilate glycerol, consuming between 38 and 48 % in approximately 24 h. L. acidophilus and L. delbrueckii showed a similar growth, higher than L. plantarum. The highest biomass reached was 2.11 g L(-)(1) for L. acidophilus, with a cell mass yield (Y (X/S)) of 0.37 g g(-)(1). L. delbrueckii and L. plantarum reached a biomass of 2.06 and 1.36 g L(-)(1). All strains catabolize glycerol mainly through glycerol kinase (EC 2.7.1.30). For these lactobacillus species, kinetic parameters for glycerol kinase showed Michaelis-Menten constant (K(m)) ranging from 1.2 to 3.8 mM. The specific activities for glycerol kinase in these strains were in the range of 0.18 to 0.58 U mg protein(-)(1), with L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 showing the maximum specific activity after 24 h of cultivation. Glycerol dehydrogenase activity was also detected in all strains studied but only for the reduction of glyceraldehyde with NADPH (K(m) for DL-glyceraldehyde ranging from 12.8 to 32.3 mM). This enzyme shows a very low oxidative activity with glycerol and NADP+ and, most likely, under physiological conditions, the oxidative reaction does not occur, supporting the assumption that the main metabolic flux concerning glycerol metabolism is through the glycerol kinase pathway.
TI  - Factors affecting adhesion of lactic acid bacteria to Caco-2 cells and inhibitory effect on infection of Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - In this study, seven strains isolated from mustard leaf kimchi were screened for  their tolerance to simulated gastric and bile juices, the adhesive properties to Caco-2 cells, and the inhibition ability of Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC 29631 adhesion. Lactobacillus acidophilus GK20, Lactobacillus paracasei GK74, and Lactobacillus plantarum GK81, which were resistant to bile as well as gastric juices, possessed high bile-salt hydrolase (BSH) activity towards both sodium glycocholate and sodium taurocholate. The strongest in vitro adherence of 53.96 +/- 4.49% was exhibited by L. plantarum GK81 followed by L. acidophilus GK20 with adhesion levels of 40.72 +/- 9.46%. The adhesion of these strains was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced after exposure to pepsin and heating for 30 min at 80 degrees C. Addition of Ca2+ led to a significant (p < 0.05) increase of the adhesion of L. acidophilus GK20, but the adhesion ability of L. plantarum GK81 was not different from the control by the addition of calcium. In the competition and exclusion experiment, the adhesion inhibition of S. Typhimurium by L. plantarum GK81 strain was much higher than the other strains. Moreover, the exclusion inhibition of S. Typhimurium by L. acidophilus GK20 was considerably high, although the inhibition activity of this strain was lower than L. plantarum GK81.
TI  - Alleviating effects of Lactobacillus strains on pathogenic Vibrio parahaemolyticus-induced intestinal fluid accumulation in the mouse model.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the probiotic effects of Lactobacillus strains against Vibrio parahaemolyticus causing gastroenteritis. Six-week-old ICR mice were pretreated with four Lactobacillus strains at three dosages, and then challenged with V. parahaemolyticus TGqx01 (serotype O3:K6). The results showed that V. parahaemolyticus TGqx01 caused severe intestinal fluid accumulation (FA) and villi damage in control mice which were pretreated with phosphate-buffered saline. In contrast, significant alleviation of FA was seen in mice pretreated by with a high dose of Lactobacillus strains (P < 0.05, n = 6) but not in mice that received low-dose pretreatments. Among middle-dose treatments, two highly adhesive strains, Lactobacillus rhamnosus H15 and Lactobacillus brevis Y29-4, significantly decreased intestinal FA and villi damage in treated mice (P < 0.05). Two low-adhesive strains, Lactobacillus acidophilus Y14-3 and Lactobacillus fermentum F16-6, had no significant alleviating effects. At the same dosing levels, no significant differences in FA were observed in mice pretreated with strains with similar adhesive abilities but different antagonistic activities. Our findings suggest that Lactobacillus strains can alleviate V. parahaemolyticus-induced intestinal FA in mice, and the doses required for in vivo efficacy depend more on adhesive ability than on the antibacterial activity of strains.
TI  - Suppressive effects of oral administration of heat-killed Lactobacillus acidophilus on T helper-17 immune responses in a bovine beta-lactoglobulin-sensitized mice model.
AB  - The present study was planned to explore the effect of Lactobacillus (L.) acidophilus on the T helper-17 (Th17) immune response in a mouse model of beta-lactoglobulin (beta-lg) allergy. Bovine beta-lg sensitised BALB/c mice were orally administered with different doses of heat-killed L. acidophilus (low, 5x10(7) colony forming unit (CFU); medium, 5x10(8) CFU; high, 5x10(9) CFU) in 200 microL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) three times a week, starting from 1 week before beta-lg sensitisation for 4 weeks. After the allergen challenge, the numbers of blood eosinophils and neutrophils were examined by light microscope; the levels of cytokine (interleukin (IL)-12, IL-4, tumor growth factor (TGF)-beta, IL-10, IL-6 and IL-17A), total immunoglobulin E (IgE) and beta-lg-specific IgE contents in the serum were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); The mRNA expression levels of TGF-beta, IL-17A,CD25, Foxp3, retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gammat (RORgammat) and IL-10 were analyzed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The results showed that oral administration of L. acidophilus suppressed hypersensitivity responses, attenuated the numbers of in fl ammatory cells and inhibited IgE production. We found up-regulation of TGF-beta and down-regulation of IL-17A in the serum of L. acidophilus-treated group, along with IL-6 levels was significantly decreased than that of the allergy group (p<0.05). Moreover, the mRNA expression levels of CD25, forkhead box P3 and TGF-beta were significantly higher in the spleen of L. acidophilus-treated group, while the mRNA expression levels of IL-17A, RORgammat and IL-10 were significantly lower than that in the allergy group (p<0.05). In conclusion, the suppression of major allergic symptoms by oral administration of L.acidophilus was probably due to improve the regulatory T (Treg)/Th17 balance and inhibit the IL-6 production.

TI  - Effect of daily consumption of probiotic yoghurt on insulin resistance in pregnant women: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Owing to excess body weight and increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines primarily during the third trimester, pregnancy is associated with elevated insulin resistance. To our knowledge, no report is available indicating the effects of probiotic yoghurt consumption on serum insulin levels in pregnant women. This study was designed to determine the effects of daily consumption of probiotic yoghurt on insulin resistance and serum insulin levels of Iranian pregnant women. SUBJECTS/METHODS: In this randomized controlled clinical trial, 70 primigravida pregnant women with singleton pregnancy at their third trimester were participated. We randomly assigned participants to consume 200 g per day of conventional (n=33) or the probiotic group (n=37) for 9 weeks. The probiotic yoghurt was a commercially available product prepared with the starter cultures of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus, enriched with probiotic culture of two strains of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus acidophilus LA5) and bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium animalis BB12) with a total of min 1 x 10(7) colony-forming units. Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after 9-week intervention to measure fasting plasma glucose and serum insulin levels. Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was used to calculate insulin resistance score. RESULTS: Although consumption of probiotic yogurt for 9 weeks did not affect serum insulin levels and HOMA-IR score, significant differences were found comparing changes in these variables between probiotic and conventional yogurts (changes from baseline in serum insulin levels: +1.2+/-1.2 vs +5.0+/-1.1 muIU/ml, respectively, P=0.02; and in HOMA-IR score: -0.2+/-0.3 vs 0.7+/-0.2, respectively, P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that in contrast to conventional yogurt, daily consumption of probiotic yogurt for 9 weeks maintains serum insulin levels and might help pregnant women prevent developing insulin resistance.
TI  - Differences in TLR9-dependent inhibitory effects of H(2)O(2)-induced IL-8 secretion and NF-kappa B/I kappa B-alpha system activation by genomic DNA from five Lactobacillus species.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) show anti-inflammatory effects, and their genomic DNA  was identified as one of the anti-inflammatory components. Despite the differences in anti-inflammatory effects between live LAB dependent not only on genus but also species, this effect has not been compared at the genomic DNA level. We compared the anti-inflammatory effects of the genomic DNA from five Lactobacillus species-Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus reuteri-using Caco-2 cells. To evaluate anti-inflammatory effects, decreases in H(2)O(2)-induced IL-8 secretion and inhibition of H(2)O(2)-induced NF-kappaB/IkappaB-alpha system activation were examined. All LAB genomic DNAs dose-dependently decreased H(2)O(2)-induced IL-8 secretion and inhibited H(2)O(2)-induced NF-kappaB/IkappaB-alpha system activation. Comparison of these effects between Lactobacillus species showed that the anti-inflammatory effects of L. acidophilus genomic DNA are lower than those of the other species. Furthermore, suppression of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), a specific receptor of bacterial DNA, expression by RNAi abolished the decrease of H(2)O(2)-induced IL-8 secretion and inhibition of H(2)O(2)-induced NF-kappaB/IkappaB-alpha system activation by LAB genomic DNA. Our results demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory effects of genomic DNA differ between Lactobacillus species and TLR9 is one of the major pathways responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of LAB genomic DNA.
TI  - Effect of supplementation of probiotics and phytosterols alone or in combination  on serum and hepatic lipid profiles and thyroid hormones of hypercholesterolemic rats.
AB  - Probiotic bacteria and phytosterols are natural hypocholesterolemic agents with potential cardiovascular benefits. Accordingly, the present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of supplementation of probiotics and phytosterols alone or in combination on serum and hepatic lipid profiles and thyroid hormones of hypercholesterolemic rats. Mixed probiotics treatment consisted of 8 probiotic strains: 2 strains of each of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus gasseri, and Lactobacillus reuteri. The rats were fed for 8 wk with the given treatments in addition to a high-fat-high-cholesterol basal diet to induce hypercholesterolemia. Results showed that supplementation significantly reduced serum total cholesterol, low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides compared with the controls. The symbiotic treatment was more effective in lowering LDL-C, whereas mixed probiotics treatment more effectively lowered serum total cholesterol and LDL-C than the phytosterol-containing treatment. The phytosterol-containing treatments induced the increased activity of thyroid glands, as evident by elevated levels of serum total thyroxine, total triiodothyronine, and free triiodothyronine. In conclusion, the lipid profile can effectively be reduced to lower the incidence of cardiovascular disease using combinations of Lactobacillus-based probiotics and phytosterols in functional foods.
TI  - Short communication: Effects of different whey concentrations on physicochemical  characteristics and viable counts of starter bacteria in dairy beverage supplemented with probiotics.
AB  - Fermented dairy beverages supplemented with the probiotics Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis containing different concentrations of whey in their formulas (0, 20, 35, 50, 65, and 80%, vol/vol) were processed and checked for pH; proteolysis; levels of glucose, lactose, ethanol, acetic acid, lactic acid, diacetyl, and acetaldehyde; and lactic bacteria and probiotic counts. The results allowed the effect of whey concentration on the dairy beverages to be observed for each of the different parameters analyzed. The degree to which the whey concentration was useful for the microbial cultures, particularly probiotic cultures, appeared to have a limit. In general, dairy beverages processed with different levels of whey in their formulation exhibited good potential as a food matrix for supplementation with probiotic bacteria, with production of characteristic compounds of fermented milk products, such as volatiles and organic acids.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of elderly Irish subjects.
AB  - AIMS: To isolate and characterize bacteriocins produced by predominant species of lactic acid bacteria from faeces of elderly subjects. METHODS AND RESULTS: Screening over 70,000 colonies, from faecal samples collected from 266 subjects, using the indicator organisms Lactobacillus bulgaricus LMG 6901 and Listeria innocua DPC 3572, identified 55 antimicrobial-producing bacteria. Genomic fingerprinting following ApaI digestion revealed 15 distinct strains. The antimicrobial activities associated with 13 of the 15 strains were sensitive to protease treatment. The predominant antimicrobial-producing species were identified as Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus crispatus and Enterococcus spp. A number of previously characterized bacteriocins, including ABP-118 and salivaricin B (from Lact. salivarius), enterocin B (Enterococcus faecium), lactacin B (Lact. acidophilus), gassericin T and a variant of gassericin A (Lact. gasseri), were identified. Interestingly, two antimicrobial-producing species, not generally associated with intestinally derived microorganisms were also isolated: Lactococcus lactis producing nisin Z and Streptococcus mutans producing mutacin II. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that bacteriocin production by intestinal isolates against our chosen targets under the screening conditions used was not frequent (0.08%). SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results presented are important due to growing evidence indicating bacteriocin production as a potential probiotic trait by virtue of strain dominance and/or pathogen inhibition in the mammalian intestine.
TI  - Adjuvant probiotics improve the eradication effect of triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection.
AB  - AIM: To investigate whether the addition of probiotics can improve the eradication effect of triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. METHODS: This open randomized trial recruited 234 H. pylori positive gastritis patients from seven local centers. The patients were randomized to one-week standard triple therapy (omeprazole 20 mg bid, clarithromycin 500 mg bid, and amoxicillin 1000 mg bid; OCA group, n = 79); two weeks of pre-treatment with probiotics, containing 3 x 10(7)Lactobacillus acidophilus per day, prior to one week of triple therapy (POCA group, n = 78); or one week of triple therapy followed by two weeks of the same probiotics (OCAP group, n = 77). Successful eradication was defined as a negative C13 or C14 urease breath test four weeks after triple therapy. Patients were asked to report associated symptoms at baseline and during follow-up, and side effects related to therapy were recorded. Data were analyzed by both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) methods. RESULTS: PP analysis involved 228 patients, 78 in the OCA, 76 in the POCA and 74 in the OCAP group. Successful eradication was observed in 171 patients; by PP analysis, the eradication rates were significantly higher (P = 0.007 each) in the POCA (62/76; 81.6%, 95% CI 72.8%-90.4%) and OCAP (61/74; 82.4%, 95% CI 73.6%-91.2%) groups than in the OCA group (48/78; 61.5%, 95% CI 50.6%-72.4%). ITT analysis also showed that eradication rates were significantly higher in the POCA (62/78; 79.5%, 95% CI 70.4%-88.6%) and OCAP (61/77; 79.2%, 95% CI 70%-88.4%) groups than in the OCA group (48/79; 60.8%, 95% CI 49.9%-71.7%), (P = 0.014 and P = 0.015). The symptom relieving rates in the POCA, OCAP and OCA groups were 85.5%, 89.2% and 87.2%, respectively. Only one of the 228 patients experienced an adverse reaction. CONCLUSION: Administration of probiotics before or after standard triple therapy may improve H. pylori eradication rates.
TI  - Effect of galactooligosaccharides and Bifidobacterium animalis Bb-12 on growth of Lactobacillus amylovorus DSM 16698, microbial community structure, and metabolite production in an in vitro colonic model set up with human or pig microbiota.
AB  - A validated in vitro model of the large intestine (TIM-2), set up with human or pig faeces, was used to evaluate the impact of potentially probiotic Lactobacillus amylovorus DSM 16698, administered alone (i), in the presence of prebiotic galactooligosaccharides (GOS) (ii), and co-administered with probiotic Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis Bb-12 (Bb-12) (iii) on GOS degradation, microbial growth (L. amylovorus, lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and total bacteria) and metabolite production. High performance anion exchange chromatography revealed that GOS degradation was more pronounced in TIM-2 inoculated with pig faeces than with human faeces. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiling of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes detected a more complex Lactobacillus spp. community in pig faecal material than in human faecal inoculum. According to 16S rRNA gene-targeted qPCR, GOS stimulated the growth of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in faecal material from both materials. The cumulative production of short chain fatty acids and ammonia was higher (P < 0.05) for pig than for human faeces. However, lactate accumulation was higher (P < 0.05) in the human model and increased after co-administration with GOS and Bb-12. This study reinforced the notion that differences in microbiota composition between target host organisms need to be considered when animal data are extrapolated to human, as is often done with pre- and probiotic intervention studies.
TI  - Comparative study of the protective capacity against Salmonella infection between probiotic and nonprobiotic Lactobacilli.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the immunoprotective ability of three Lactobacilli strains against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium in a mouse model. To identify the probiotic properties involved in the protection against infection caused by this pathogen. METHODS AND RESULTS: The immunomodulatory effect of three different lactobacilli strains: Lactobacillus (Lact.) casei CRL 431 (probiotic bacterium), Lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CRL 423 (Lact. bulgaricus) and Lact.acidophilus CRL 730 was compared using a mouse model of Salmonella infection. Lactobacillus casei continuous administration improved animal survival, diminished pathogen spreading outside the intestine, attenuated the intestinal inflammation, modulated cytokine profile previous and postinfection and increased the expression and secretion of IgA in the gut. Additionally, the administration of this lactobacilli increased peritoneal, Peyer's patches and spleen macrophages' phagocytic activity in healthy mice and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-1) released by intestinal epithelial cells in an in vitro assay. Although Lact. acidophilus increased the number of IgA-secreting cells previous and postinfection, and Lact. bulgaricus increased MCP-1 released by intestinal epithelial cells and the phagocytic activity of macrophages, these effects alone were not enough to confer protection against Salmonella Typhimurium infection in mouse. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotic strain Lact. casei CRL 431 was the one that induced protection against Salmonella, by increasing the intestinal barrier function and by decreasing the local inflammatory response. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Salmonella spp. constitutes an important agent of foodborne diseases in the world. Not all lactobacilli, even with some immunostimulating properties at gut level, can protect against Salmonella infection. Lactobacillus casei CRL 431, a probiotic bacterium, could be useful as an oral mucosal adjuvant of the immune system to improve gut health, especially in the prevention or amelioration of Salmonella infections. We demonstrated that there is not a unique mechanism by which this protective effect was exerted.
TI  - Evaluation of probiotic strains for development of fermented Alisma canaliculatum and their effects on broiler chickens.
AB  - The present study was conducted to select appropriate microbial strains for the development of fermented Alisma canaliculatum A. Br. et Bouche (FAC) feed additive and to examine their effects on broilers. In experiment 1, 16 strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus coagulans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae from the Korean Collection for Type Cultures (KCTC) were evaluated. The strains were tested for their acid, bile, and heat tolerance levels. Among them, L. acidophilus KCTC 3111, E. faecium KCTC 2022, B. subtilis KCTC 3239, and S. cerevisiae KCTC 7928 were selected to produce FAC. For experiment 2, 140 Ross broiler chicks were allocated to four 5-wk-long dietary groups: NC (basal diet), PC (basal diet with 0.005% oxytetracycline), AC (basal diet with 0.5% A. canaliculatum rhizome powder), and FAC (basal diet with 0.5% FAC). Final BW and total BW gain were increased (P < 0.05) upon the addition of FAC, whereas feed conversion ratio improved (P < 0.05) in the supplemented groups compared with the NC group. Crude protein content increased and crude fat decreased (P < 0.05) in the breast meat of the FAC group compared with the AC and PC groups, respectively. Proventriculus and kidney relative weights of the FAC group differed (P < 0.05) from the AC group but not from the PC group. Lower (P < 0.05) thiobarbituric acid reactive substances value of thigh meat was observed in the FAC group compared with the other groups. The FAC diet increased (P < 0.05) alpha-linolenic acid and linoleic acid in meat. Alteration of these fatty acids led to increased levels of polyunsaturated fatty acid, polyunsaturated fatty acid /saturated fatty acid, n-3 and n-6 fatty acids, and decreased n-6/n-3 ratio in breast or thigh meat (P < 0.05). It is concluded that FAC confers high tolerance to acid, bile and heat; and beneficially affects growth, meat composition, oxidative stability, and fatty acid composition. The FAC may be a functional feed additive in broilers.
TI  - Probiotics prevent necrotizing enterocolitis by modulating enterocyte genes that  regulate innate immune-mediated inflammation.
AB  - Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), an extensive intestinal inflammatory disease of  premature infants, is caused, in part, by an excessive inflammatory response to initial bacterial colonization due to the immature expression of innate immune response genes. In a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial, supplementation of very low birth weight infants with probiotics significantly reduced the incidence of NEC. The primary goal of this study was to determine whether secreted products of these two clinically effective probiotic strains, Bifidobacterium infantis and Lactobacillus acidophilus, prevented NEC by accelerating the maturation of intestinal innate immune response genes and whether both strains are required for this effect. After exposure to probiotic conditioned media (PCM), immature human enterocytes, immature human intestinal xenografts, and primary enterocyte cultures of NEC tissue (NEC-IEC) were assayed for an IL-8 and IL-6 response to inflammatory stimuli. The latter two models were also assayed for innate immune response gene expression. In the immature xenograft, PCM exposure significantly attenuated LPS and IL-1beta-induced IL-8 and IL-6 expression, decreased TLR2 mRNA and TLR4 mRNA, and increased mRNA levels of specific negative regulators of inflammation, SIGIRR and Tollip. In NEC-IEC, PCM decreased TLR2-dependent IL-8 and IL-6 induction and increased SIGIRR and Tollip expression. The attenuated inflammatory response with PCM was reversed with Tollip siRNA-mediated knockdown. The anti-inflammatory secreted factor is a 5- to 10-kDa molecule resistant to DNase, RNase, protease, heat stress, and acid exposure. B. infantis-conditioned media showed superior anti-inflammatory properties to that of L. acidophilus in immature human enterocytes, suggesting a strain specificity to this effect. We conclude that PCM promotes maturation of innate immune response gene expression, potentially explaining the protective effects of probiotics in clinical NEC.
TI  - Targeting aberrant colon cancer-specific DNA methylation with lipoteichoic acid-deficient Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Pathogenic autoinflammatory responses triggered by dysregulated microbial interactions may lead to intestinal disorders and malignancies. Previously, we demonstrated that a lipoteichoic acid (LTA)-deficient Lactobacillus acidophilus strain, NCK2025, ameliorated inflammation-induced colitis, significantly reduced the number of polyps in a colonic polyposis cancer model and restored physiological homeostasis in both cases. Nonetheless, the regulatory signals delivered by NCK2025 to reprogram the gastrointestinal microenvironment, and thus resist colonic cancer progression, remain unknown. Accumulating evidence suggest that epigenetic changes, in the presence and absence of pathogenic inflammation, can result in colorectal cancer (CRC). To test possible epigenetic modifications induced by NCK2025, the expression of epigenetically regulated, CRC-associated genes was measured with and without bacterial treatment. In vivo and in vitro, NCK2025 enhanced the expression of tumor suppressor genes that may regulate CRC development. Therefore, differential epigenetic regulation of CRC-related genes by NCK2025 represents a potential therapy against colitis-associated and sporadic CRC.
TI  - Evaluation of Lactobacillus strains for selected probiotic properties.
AB  - Eleven strains of Lactobacillus collected in the Culture Collection of Dairy Microorganisms (CCDM) were evaluated for selected probiotic properties such as survival in gastrointestinal fluids, antimicrobial activity, and competition with non-toxigenic Escherichia coli O157:H7 for adhesion on Caco-2 cells. The viable count of lactobacilli was reduced during 3-h incubation in gastric fluid followed by 3-h incubation in intestinal fluid. All strains showed antimicrobial activity and the three most effective strains inhibited the growth of at least 16 indicator strains. Antimicrobial metabolites of seven strains active against Lactobacillus and Clostridium indicator strains were found to be sensitive to proteinase K and trypsin, which indicates their proteinaceous nature. The degree of competitive inhibition of non-toxigenic E. coli O157:H7 adhesion on the surface of Caco-2 cells was strain-dependent. A significant decrease (P < 0.05) in the number of non-toxigenic E. coli O157:H7 adhering to Caco-2 cells was observed with all lactobacilli. Three strains were selected for additional studies of antimicrobial activity, i.e., Lactobacillus gasseri CCDM 215, Lactobacillus acidophilus CCDM 149, and Lactobacillus helveticus CCDM 82.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo investigation of the biological and mechanical behaviour of  resin-modified glass-ionomer cement containing chlorhexidine.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate: (1) the in vitro antibacterial, cytotoxic and mechanical properties of a resin-modified glass ionomer cement (RMGIC) containing different concentrations of chlorhexidine (CHX) and (2) the in vivo microbiologic action of the best concentration of CHX associated with the RMGIC applied on remaining dentine after indirect pulp treatment (IPT). METHODS: For the in vitro studies, RMGIC was associated with 0.2, 0.5, 1.25 and 2.5% CHX. Microbiologic evaluation consisted of an agar diffusion test on cariogenic bacteria for 24h. Odontoblast-like cell metabolism and morphology analyses measured the cytotoxic effects of the RMGIC groups after 24h. The same groups were submitted to compressive and diametral tensile strength. The in vivo treatment consisted of IPT using an RMGIC associated with the best CHX concentration. Clinical and microbiologic evaluations were performed before and after 3 months. RESULTS: The use of 1.25% CHX significantly improved the antibacterial effects of the evaluated RMGIC, without causing any detrimental effects to the odontoblast-like cells and on the mechanical properties. This RMGIC and CHX combination completely eliminated mutans streptococci after 3 months of IPT. CONCLUSION: The RMGIC and 1.25% CHX mixture showed great biological and mechanical behaviour and could be a good treatment against caries progression. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The association of CHX with a liner RMGIC opens a new perspective for arresting residual caries after IPT.
TI  - The effect of lacto- and bifidobacteria compositions on the vaginal microflora in cases of intravaginal staphylococcosis.
AB  - The effect of intravaginal injection of Lactobacillus casei IMV B-7280, Lactobacillus acidophilus IMV B-7279, Bifidobacterium animalis VKL and Bifidobacterium animalis VKB strains in various compositions on the range of microflora of the urogenital tract on the model of experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis of mice was determined. It was established that under the influence of various compositions of these strains changes in microflora spectrum occurred: the number of representatives of normoflora increased and the number of pathogenic microorganisms, including staphylococci, streptococci, coliform bacteria and fungi, significantly decreased. It was determined that strains of lacto- and bifidobacteria, that were studied, are prospective components of future probiotic drugs efficient in treating staphylococcosis.
TI  - Astragalus root and elderberry fruit extracts enhance the IFN-beta stimulatory effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus in murine-derived dendritic cells.
AB  - Many foods and food components boost the immune system, but little data are available regarding the mechanisms by which they do. Bacterial strains have disparate effects in stimulating the immune system. In dendritic cells, the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli upregulates proinflammatory cytokines, whereas gram-positive Lactobacillus acidophilus induces a robust interferon (IFN)-beta response. The immune-modulating effects of astragalus root and elderberry fruit extracts were examined in bone marrow-derived murine dendritic cells that were stimulated with L. acidophilus or E. coli. IFN-beta and other cytokines were measured by ELISA and RT-PCR. Endocytosis of fluorescence-labeled dextran and L. acidophilus in the presence of elderberry fruit or astragalus root extract was evaluated in dendritic cells. Our results show that both extracts enhanced L. acidophilus-induced IFN-beta production and slightly decreased the proinflammatory response to E. coli. The enhanced IFN-beta production was associated with upregulation of toll-like receptor 3 and to a varying degree, the cytokines IL-12, IL-6, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha. Both extracts increased endocytosis in immature dendritic cells, and only slightly influenced the viability of the cells. In conclusion, astragalus root and elderberry fruit extracts increase the IFN-beta inducing activity of L. acidophilus in dendritic cells, suggesting that they may exert antiviral and immune-enhancing activity.
TI  - Complete genome sequence of Lactobacillus helveticus R0052, a commercial probiotic strain.
AB  - Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 is a commercially available strain that is widely  used in probiotic preparations. The genome sequence consisted of 2,129,425 bases. Comparative analysis showed that it was unique among L. helveticus strains in that it contained genes encoding mucus-binding proteins similar to those found in Lactobacillus acidophilus.
TI  - Development of probiotic dairy beverages: rheological properties and application  of mathematical models in sensory evaluation.
AB  - Strawberry-flavored probiotic dairy beverages (2% vol/vol Lactobacillus acidophilus) were produced using 0, 20, 35, 50, 65, and 80% (vol/vol) whey in their formulations. Mathematical models (survival analysis, minimal significant difference, and mean global acceptance) were used to identify the optimal (sensorially) whey concentration in probiotic beverages. Fifty-five consumers evaluated acceptance of the beverages using hybrid 9-point hedonic scales. In addition, Lb. acidophilus were enumerated and pH was determined. Rheological behavior is an important characteristic for the processing and sensory acceptance of dairy beverages, varying with the presence of additives, fermentation process (time, bacterial strain), and whey concentrations used. All beverages presented minimal counts of 8 log cfu/mL of Lb. acidophilus, and pH ranged from 4.09 to 4.14. Increasing the whey content increased the fragility of the gel structure, probably because of the replacement of casein by whey proteins, once the concentrations of other ingredients in formulation were fixed. Whey content had a significant effect on acceptance of the probiotic dairy beverages; beverages with whey contents greater than 65% resulted in lower acceptance by consumers. The model of mean global acceptance presented 2 solutions with high sensory scores: beverages with 12 and 65% whey, the latter being of interest because it allows greater use of the whey by-product. The Weibull distribution presented a prediction of whey concentration of 49%, with higher sensory acceptance. The methodologies used in this research were shown to be useful in determining the constituents of food formulations, especially for whey-based probiotic beverages.
TI  - Characterization of the Lactobacillus casei group based on the profiling of ribosomal proteins coded in S10-spc-alpha operons as observed by MALDI-TOF MS.
AB  - The taxonomy of the members of the Lactobacillus casei group is complicated because of their phylogenetic similarity and controversial nomenclatural status. In this study, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) of ribosomal proteins coded in the S10-spc-alpha operon, termed S10-GERMS, was applied in order to classify 33 sample strains belonging to the L. casei group. A total of 14 types of ribosomal protein genes coded in the operon were first sequenced from four type strains of the L. casei group (L. casei JCM 1134(T), L. paracasei subsp. paracasei JCM 8130(T), L. paracasei subsp. tolerans JCM 1171(T), and L. rhamnosus JCM 1136(T)) together with L. casei JCM 11302, which is the former type strain of 'L. zeae'. The theoretical masses of the 14 types of ribosomal proteins used as biomarkers were classified into five types and compiled into a ribosomal protein database. The observed ribosomal proteins of each strain, identified by MALDI-TOF MS, were categorized into types based on their masses, summarized as ribosomal protein profiles, and they were used to construct a phylogenetic tree. The 33 sample strains, together with seven genome-sequenced strains, could be classified into four major clusters, which coincided precisely with the taxa of the (sub)species within the L. casei group. Three "ancient" strains, identified as L. acidophilus and L. casei, were correctly re-identified as L. paracasei subsp. paracasei by S10-GERMS. S10-GERMS would thus appear to be a powerful tool for phylogenetic characterization, with considerable potential for management of culture collections.
TI  - Influence of in ovo prebiotic and synbiotic administration on meat quality of broiler chickens.
AB  - A trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of in ovo injection of prebiotic and synbiotics on growth performance, meat quality traits (cholesterol content, intramuscular collagen properties, fiber measurements), and the presence of histopathological changes in the pectoral muscle (PS) of broiler chickens. On d 12 of incubation, 480 eggs were randomly divided into 5 experimental groups treated with different bioactives, in ovo injected: C, control with physiological saline; T1 with 1.9 mg of raffinose family oligosaccharides; T2 and T3 with 1.9 mg of raffinose family oligosaccharides enriched with different probiotic bacteria, specifically 1,000 cfu of Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis SL1 and Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris IBB SC1, respectively; T4 with commercially available synbiotic Duolac, containing 500 cfu of both Lactobacillus acidophilus and Streptococcus faecium with the addition of lactose (0.001 mg/embryo). Among the hatched chickens, 60 males were randomly chosen (12 birds for each group) and were grown to 42 d in collective cages (n = 3 birds in each 4 cages: replications for experimental groups). Broilers were fed ad libitum commercial diets according to age. In ovo prebiotic and synbiotic administration had a low effect on investigated traits, but depend on the kind of bioactives administered. Commercial synbiotic treatment (T4) reduced carcass yield percentage, and the feed conversion ratio was higher in T3 and T4 groups compared with other groups. The abdominal fat, the ultimate pH, and cholesterol of the PS were not affected by treatment. Broiler chickens of the treated groups with both slightly greater PS and fiber diameter had a significantly lower amount of collagen. The greater thickness of muscle fibers (not significant) and the lower fiber density (statistically significant), observed in treated birds in comparison with those of the C group, are not associated with histopathological changes in the PS of broilers. The incidence of histopathological changes in broiler chickens from examined groups was low, which did not affect the deterioration of meat quality obtained from these birds.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus upregulates intestinal NHE3 expression and function.
AB  - A major mechanism of electroneutral NaCl absorption in the human ileum and colon  involves coupling of Na(+)/H(+) and Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchangers. Disturbances in these mechanisms have been implicated in diarrheal conditions. Probiotics such as Lactobacillus have been indicated to be beneficial in the management of gastrointestinal disorders, including diarrhea. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying antidiarrheal effects of probiotics have not been fully understood. We have previously demonstrated Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) to stimulate Cl(-)/HCO3- exchange activity via an increase in the surface levels and expression of the Cl(-)/HCO3- exchanger DRA in vitro and in vivo. However, the effects of LA on NHE3, the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger involved in the coupled electroneutral NaCl absorption, are not known. Current studies were, therefore, undertaken to investigate the effects of LA on the function and expression of NHE3 and to determine the mechanisms involved. Treatment of Caco2 cells with LA or its conditioned culture supernatant (CS) for 8-24 h resulted in a significant increase in Na(+)/H(+) exchange activity, mRNA, and protein levels of NHE3. LA-CS upregulation of NHE3 function and expression was also observed in SK-CO15 cells, a human colonic adenocarcinoma cell line. Additionally, LA treatment increased NHE3 promoter activity, suggesting involvement of transcriptional mechanisms. In vivo, mice gavaged with live LA showed significant increase in NHE3 mRNA and protein expression in the ileum and colonic regions. In conclusion, LA-induced increase in NHE3 expression may contribute to the upregulation of intestinal electrolyte absorption and might underlie the potential antidiarrheal effects of probiotics.
TI  - The effect of NaCl substitution with KCl on proteinase activities of cell-free extract and cell-free supernatant at different pH levels and salt concentrations: Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of substitution of NaCl with  KCl at different pH levels and salt concentrations on proteinase activity of cell-free extract and cell-free supernatant of the probiotics Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei. de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe broth aliquots were mixed with 2 pure salts (NaCl and KCl) and 2 salt concentrations at 2 concentration levels (5 and 10%), inoculated with Lactobacillus acidophilus or Lactobacillus casei, and incubated aerobically at 37 degrees C for 22 h. The cultures were then centrifuged at 4,000xg for 30 min, and the collected cell pellets were used to prepare cell-wall proteinases and the supernatants used as a source of supernatant (extracellular) proteinases. The proteolytic activity and protein content of both portions were determined. After incubation of both portions with 3 milk caseins (alpha-, beta-, kappa-casein), the supernatants were individually subjected to analysis of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity and proteolytic activity using the o-phthalaldehyde method. Significant differences were observed in ACE-inhibitory and proteolytic activities between salt substitution treatments of cell-free extract and cell-free supernatant from both probiotic strains at the same salt concentration and pH level.
TI  - The effect of selected synbiotics on microbial composition and short-chain fatty  acid production in a model system of the human colon.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics can be used to modulate both the composition and activity of the gut microbiota and thereby potentially affecting host health beneficially. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of eight synbiotic combinations on the composition and activity of human fecal microbiota using a four-stage semicontinuous model system of the human colon. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Carbohydrates were selected by their ability to enhance growth of the probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM (NCFM) and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bl-04 (Bl-04) under laboratory conditions. The most effective carbohydrates for each probiotic were further investigated, using the colonic model, for the ability to support growth of the probiotic bacteria, influence the composition of the microbiota and stimulate formation of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA).The following combinations were studied: NCFM with isomaltulose, cellobiose, raffinose and an oat beta-glucan hydrolysate (OBGH) and Bl-04 with melibiose, xylobiose, raffinose and maltotriose. All carbohydrates showed capable of increasing levels of NCFM and Bl-04 during fermentations in the colonic model by 10(3)-10(4) fold and 10-10(2) fold, respectively. Also the synbiotic combinations decreased the modified ratio of Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes (calculated using qPCR results for Bacteroides-Prevotella-Porphyromonas group, Clostridium perfringens cluster I, Clostridium coccoides - Eubacterium rectale group and Clostridial cluster XIV) as well as significantly increasing SCFA levels, especially acetic and butyric acid, by three to eight fold, as compared to the controls. The decreases in the modified ratio of Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes were found to be correlated to increases in acetic and butyric acid (p=0.04 and p=0.03, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that all synbiotic combinations investigated are able to shift the predominant bacteria and the production of SCFA of fecal microbiota in a model system of the human colon, thereby potentially being able to manipulate the microbiota in a way connected to human health.
TI  - [Assessment of antagonistic activity in vitro Lactobacillus spp. strains againts  Clostridum difficile strains isolated from gastrointestinal tract of patients hospitalized in three hospitals in region Mazovia].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to evaluate the antagonistic activity of  Lactobacillus strains against clinical C. difficile strains isolated from faecal samples of adults patients with diarrhea. A total 61 strains of C. difficile randomly selected isolated in the period 2007-2008 from the gastrointestinal tract of hospitalized patients in three hospitals province Mazovia, Poland. To determination of antagonistic activity ofprobiotic Lactobacillus spp. strains used four reference strains: Lactobacillus plantarum 2017405, Lactobacillus fermentum 353, Lactobacillus acidophilus DSM 21007 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. METHODS: Isolation of C. difficile was performed on selective Columbia agar supplemented with cycloserine/cefoxitine and amphothericin B (CLO medium, bioMerieux, France). The plates were incubated in an anaerobic chamber for 48 h at 37 degrees C. Isolates were identified as C. difficile by the characteristic morphology of the colonies and horse-like odour, green yellow fluorescence under UV. Toxigenicity of of C. difficile strains was determined in PCR to detection of fragments of genes encoding toxin A (tcdA), toxin B (tcdB) and binary toxin (cdtA and cdtB). The study of antagonistic activity four Lactobacillus spp. strains against 61 clinical C. difficile strains was performed according to standard methods. Lactobacillus strains were inoculated on MRS medium and incubated in oxygen-free atmosphere and cut the bars of MRS agar and applied to the plate with cultures of C. difficile strains. RESULTS: Assessment of antagonist activity of Lactobacillus spp. strains was performed by measuring the zone of inhibition of grown of C. difficile strains. The study shows that of probiotic Lactobacillus spp. strains interacted antagonistically in vitro against all toxigenic (A+B+CDT- and A+B+CDT+) of C. difficile strains. CONCLUSIONS: The differences in the antagonistic activity of Lactobacillus spp. strains against different toxigenic clinical C. difficile strains were not observed.
TI  - Gram stains: a resource for retrospective analysis of bacterial pathogens in clinical studies.
AB  - We demonstrate the feasibility of using qPCR on DNA extracted from vaginal Gram stain slides to estimate the presence and relative abundance of specific bacterial pathogens. We first tested Gram stained slides spiked with a mix of 10(8) cfu/ml of Escherichia coli and 10(5) cfu/ml of Lactobacillus acidophilus. Primers were designed for amplification of total and species-specific bacterial DNA based on 16S ribosomal gene regions. Sample DNA was pre-amplified with nearly full length 16S rDNA ribosomal gene fragment, followed by quantitative PCR with genera and species-specific 16S rDNA primers. Pre-amplification PCR increased the bacterial amounts; relative proportions of Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus recovered from spiked slides remained unchanged. We applied this method to forty two archived Gram stained slides available from a clinical trial of cerclage in pregnant women at high risk of preterm birth. We found a high correlation between Nugent scores based on bacterial morphology of Lactobacillus, Gardenerella and Mobiluncus and amounts of quantitative PCR estimated genus specific DNA (rrn copies) from Gram stained slides. Testing of a convenience sample of eight paired vaginal swabs and Gram stains freshly collected from healthy women found similar qPCR generated estimates of Lactobacillus proportions from Gram stained slides and vaginal swabs. Archived Gram stained slides collected from large scale epidemiologic and clinical studies represent a valuable, untapped resource for research on the composition of bacterial communities that colonize human mucosal surfaces.
TI  - Eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection by the probiotic strains Lactobacillus johnsonii MH-68 and L. salivarius ssp. salicinius AP-32.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The current therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection includes antimicrobial agents and proton pump inhibitors. We have examined the ability of Lactobacillus spp. to inhibit H. pylori infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Probiotic strains isolated from samples of adult feces, infant feces, breast milk, and vaginal swab collected from healthy volunteers in Taiwan and commercially available strains were screened for antagonism toward H. pylori. Inhibition liquid culture assay was used to screen potential anti-H. pylori activity. Then, we performed agar plate inhibition assay, and assays to determine the capacity of probiotics for adhesion, and inhibition and killing of H. pylori, and measured the levels of IL-8 and IL-10. Using animal models, we studied regulation of gastric acid and histopathological changes accompanying anti-H. pylori activity. RESULTS: We found that six of the tested strains suppressed urease activity of H. pylori: Lactobacillus acidophilus TYCA08, L. acidophilus TYCA15, L. johnsonii MH-68, and L. salivarius subsp. salicinius AP-32 were more effective than the others. In vivo, L. johnsonii MH-68 and L. salivarius subsp. salicinius AP-32 alone or in combination, reduced the H. pylori load in the gastric mucosa, and also reduced inflammatory chemokine expression and lymphocyte infiltration. CONCLUSIONS: Lactobacillus johnsonii MH-68 and L. salivarius subsp. salicinius AP-32 effectively suppress H. pylori viability, and when used as probiotics, they may help decrease the occurrence of gastritis, and even reduce the risk of H. pylori infection.
TI  - Bugs that debugs: Probiotics.
AB  - The oral cavity harbors a diverse array of bacterial species. There are more than 600 species that colonize in the oral cavity. These include a lot of organisms that are not commonly known to reside in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and also are more familiar: Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Lactobacillus salivarius. The balance of all these microorganisms can easily be disturbed and a prevalence of pathogenic organisms can lead to various oral health problems including dental caries, periodontitis, and halitosis.
TI  - Mucosal immunology and probiotics.
AB  - The cross-talk between the mucosa-associated immune system and microbiota is critical in mucosal tissue homeostasis as well as in protection against infectious and inflammatory diseases occurring at mucosal sites. This recent evidence has paved the way to therapeutic approaches aimed at modulating the mucosa-associated immune system using probiotics. Different strains of probiotics possess the ability to finely regulate dendritic cell (DC) activation, polarizing the subsequent T cell activity toward Th1 (e.g. Lactobacillus (Lb) acidophilus), Th2 (Lb.reuteri and Bifidobacterium bifidum) or, as more recently demonstrated, Th17 responses induced by specific strains such as Lb.rhamnosus GG and Lac23a, the latter isolated in our laboratory. Here, we review some recent advances in our understanding of probiotics effects on mucosal immunology, particularly on cells of the innate immunity such as DCs. We also highlight our own experiences in modulating DC functions by commensal bacteria and discuss the relevance of probiotics administration in the treatment of human immunopathologies.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 cell surface hydrophobicity and survival of the cells under adverse environmental conditions.
AB  - Changes in the cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) of probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 and the survival of these cells were examined in response to varied cultivation conditions and adverse environmental conditions. An inverse linear relationship (P < 0.01) was detected between the CSH of intact L. acidophilus La5 and B. lactis Bb12 and survival of cells subjected to subsequent freezing/thawing, long-term storage or exposure to mineral and bile acids. The observed relationships were supported by significant correlations between the CSH and changes in composition of the cell envelopes (proteins, lipids and carbohydrates) of L. acidophilus La5 and B. lactis Bb12 examined using FT-IR spectroscopy and conventional biochemical analysis methods. The results also suggest that the estimates of hydrophobicity, being a generalized characteristic of cell surfaces, are important parameters to predict the ability of intact probiotic bacteria to endure extreme environments and therefore should be monitored during cultivation. A defined balance of cell components, which can be characterized by the reduced CSH values, apparently helps to ensure the resistance, improved viability and hence the overall probiotic properties of bacteria.
TI  - Capability of different non-nutritive feed additives on improving productive and  physiological traits of broiler chicks fed diets with or without aflatoxin during the first 3 weeks of life.
AB  - An experiment was conducted to determine whether some non-nutritive feed additives (NNFA) could block the adverse effects of aflatoxin (AF) on growth performance and physiological parameters of Cobb broilers throughout the period from 1 to 21 day of age. There were eight treatments consisting of two levels of AF at 0 and 200 ppb and four NNFA within each AF level. These additives included mannan oligosaccharides (MOS) at 2 g/kg diet, hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicate (HSCAS) at 2 g/kg diet and Lactobacillus acidophilus (Lac) at 2 g/kg diet. At 21 day of age, five chickens of each treatment were slaughtered to study dressing percentage and relative weight of inner organs and glands. AF had a significant negative effect on body weight gain (BWG), and feed intake, while impairing feed conversion ratio (FCR). Aflatoxin significantly increased percentage liver, lymphocyte (%), monocyte (%), serum triglyceride level, and the aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), concentrations while decreasing dressing percentage, intestinal percentage, white blood cells (WBCs), red blood cells (RBCs), haemoglobin (Hgb), packed cell volume (PCV), heterophil (%), heterophil/lymphocyte ratio, total serum protein and serum albumin. Aflatoxin adversely affected the morphology of the liver, bursa and the thymus. There was a significant interaction between AF and NNFA on the relative weights of liver, heart and intestine. Lac completely blocked the negative effects of AF on the percentage liver and the heart and partially on the intestine. In conclusion, Lac was most effective in reversing the adverse effects of AF on growth and FCR and on the percentage, functions and morphology of the liver. Hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicate also improved the economic traits of broilers but was less effective than Lac and more effective than MOS.
TI  - [Analysis on the antimicrobial resistance of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the yogurt sold in China].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the antimicrobial susceptibility of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from yogurt, and to provide references for evaluating the safety of LAB and screening safe strains. METHODS: The sensitivity of 43 LAB strains, including 14 strains of Streptococcus thermophilus, 12 strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, 9 strains of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and 8 strains of Bifidobacterium, to 22 antibiotics were tested by agar plate dilution method. RESULTS: All 43 LAB strains were resistant to trimethoprim, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, danofloxacin and polymyxin E. Their resistances to kanamycin, tetracycline, clindamycin, doxycycline and cephalothin were varied. The sensitivity to other antibiotics were sensitive or moderate. All isolates were multidrug-resistant. CONCLUSION: The antimicrobial resistance of tested LAB strains was comparatively serious, and continuously monitoring their antimicrobial resistance and evaluating their safety should be strengthened.
TI  - Yogurt containing bioactive molecules produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5  exerts a protective effect against enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli in mice.
AB  - An active fraction extracted from Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 cell-free spent medium (LAla-5AF) was incorporated in a dairy matrix and tested to assess its antivirulent effect against enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC). Mice in experimental groups were fed for 4 days with yogurt supplemented with LAla-5AF. On the fifth day, mice were challenged with a single dose (10(7) CFU per mouse) of E. coli O157:H7. The clinical manifestations of the infection were significantly less severe in mice fed the yogurt supplemented with LAla-5AF. EHEC attachment and colonization was attenuated by LAla-5AF. Tumor necrosis factor alpha production was down-regulated, which might indicate a protective effect in the kidney during EHEC infection. To investigate the mechanisms associated with the in vivo effects observed, LAla-5AF was tested by reverse transcription real-time PCR to confirm its effects on the expression of several virulence genes of EHEC O157. The results showed that these fractions were able to down-regulate several virulence genes of EHEC, including stxB2, qseA, luxS, tir, ler, eaeA, and hlyB.
TI  - Elaboration of a probiotic oblea from whey fermented using Lactobacillus acidophilus or Bifidobacterium infantis.
AB  - A novel probiotic product was developed, which was formulated as an oblea (wafer-type dehydrated traditional Mexican dessert) using goat sweet whey fermented with Bifidobacterium infantis or Lactobacillus acidophilus. To obtain the probiotic oblea, the fermented whey was formulated with prebiotic carbohydrates (inulin and resistant starch) and gelatin, and the preparation was poured onto a polytetrafluoroethylene-coated nonstick baking pan, dried in a convection oven, and finally dehydrated at a low relative humidity and room temperature (23+/-2 degrees C). The amounts of prebiotic carbohydrates and gelatin to be used in the formulation were determined by a factorial experimental design. An untrained sensory panel evaluated 3 quality characteristics (film formation, homogeneity, and smoothness) in the final product. Three different drying temperatures were tested, namely, 40, 55, and 70 degrees C. Bacterial survival at each temperature was determined by viable plate-counting. The best formulation, based on the quality characteristics tested, consisted of 58.33% (vol/vol) of fermented whey, 8.33% (vol/vol) of 6% (wt/vol) resistant starch dispersion, 16.66% (vol/vol) of 15% (wt/vol) inulin solution, and 16.66% (vol/vol) of a 10% (wt/vol) gelatin solution. Drying at 55+/-2 degrees C for 2.66+/-0.22 h allowed for concentrations of probiotic bacteria above 9 log(10) cfu/g, which is above the minimum concentration required in a probiotic product.
TI  - Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus regulate inflammatory pathway and improve antioxidant status in collagen-induced arthritic rats.
AB  - In view of well-established immunomodulatory properties of Lactobacillus, present investigation was carried out to evaluate antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential of Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus, against inflammatory pathway and oxidative stress developed in an experimental model of arthritis. Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model was used. Oral administration of L. casei, L. acidophilus, standard antiarthritic drug indomethacin, and vehicle were started after induced arthritis and continued up to day 28. Interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-17, IL-4, and IL-10 levels were estimated in serum. In parallel, oxidative stress parameters were also measured from synovial effsuate. All rats were graded for arthritis score at the end of each week. L. casei, L. acidophilus, and indomethacin treatment significantly downregulated proinflammatory and upregulated anti-inflammatory cytokines at P<0.0001. They have significantly decreased oxidative stress in synovial effsuate (P<0.0001) and also arthritis score (P<0.05). Protection provided by L. casei and L. acidophilus was more pronounced than that of indomethacin. These lines of evidence suggest that L. casei and L. acidophilus exert potent protective effect against CIA. It further establishes effective anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of Lactobacillus. However, additional clinical investigations are needed to prove the efficacy of Lactobacillus in treatment/management of rheumatoid arthritis.
TI  - Transcriptional analysis of prebiotic uptake and catabolism by Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM.
AB  - The human gastrointestinal tract can be positively modulated by dietary supplementation of probiotic bacteria in combination with prebiotic carbohydrates. Here differential transcriptomics and functional genomics were used to identify genes in Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM involved in the uptake and catabolism of 11 potential prebiotic compounds consisting of alpha- and beta-linked galactosides and glucosides. These oligosaccharides induced genes encoding phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar phosphotransferase systems (PTS), galactoside pentose hexuronide (GPH) permease, and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. PTS systems were upregulated primarily by di- and tri-saccharides such as cellobiose, isomaltose, isomaltulose, panose and gentiobiose, while ABC transporters were upregulated by raffinose, Polydextrose, and stachyose. A single GPH transporter was induced by lactitol and galactooligosaccharides (GOS). The various transporters were associated with a number of glycoside hydrolases from families 1, 2, 4, 13, 32, 36, 42, and 65, involved in the catabolism of various alpha- and beta-linked glucosides and galactosides. Further subfamily specialization was also observed for different PTS-associated GH1 6-phospho-beta-glucosidases implicated in the catabolism of gentiobiose and cellobiose. These findings highlight the broad oligosaccharide metabolic repertoire of L. acidophilus NCFM and establish a platform for selection and screening of both probiotic bacteria and prebiotic compounds that may positively influence the gastrointestinal microbiota.
TI  - Stability of free and encapsulated Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 in yogurt  and in an artificial human gastric digestion system.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the effect of encapsulation on survival of probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 (ATCC 4356) in yogurt and during artificial gastric digestion. Strain ATCC 4356 was added to yogurt either encapsulated in calcium alginate or in free form (unencapsulated) at levels of 8.26 and 9.47 log cfu/g, respectively, and the influence of alginate capsules (1.5 to 2.5mm) on the sensorial characteristics of yogurts was investigated. The ATCC 4356 strain was introduced into an artificial gastric solution consisting of 0.08 N HCl (pH 1.5) containing 0.2% NaCl or into artificial bile juice consisting of 1.2% bile salts in de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe broth to determine the stability of the probiotic bacteria. When incubated for 2h in artificial gastric juice, the free ATCC 4356 did not survive (reduction of >7 log cfu/g). We observed, however, greater survival of encapsulated ATCC 4356, with a reduction of only 3 log cfu/g. Incubation in artificial bile juice (6 h) did not significantly affect the viability of free or encapsulated ATCC 4356. Moreover, statistically significant reductions (~1 log cfu/g) of both free and encapsulated ATCC 4356 were observed during 4-wk refrigerated storage of yogurts. The addition of probiotic cultures in free or alginate-encapsulated form did not significantly affect appearance/color or flavor/odor of the yogurts. However, significant deficiencies were found in body/texture of yogurts containing encapsulated ATCC 4356. We concluded that incorporation of free and encapsulated probiotic bacteria did not substantially change the overall sensory properties of yogurts, and encapsulation in alginate using the extrusion method greatly enhanced the survival of probiotic bacteria against an artificial human gastric digestive system.
TI  - Lactobacillus reuteri CRL 1098 and Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 1014 differently reduce in vitro immunotoxic effect induced by Ochratoxin A.
AB  - Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a widespread mycotoxin contaminating several food products  which causes detrimental health effects. The ability of Lactobacillus reuteri CRL 1098 and Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 1014 to prevent OTA effects on TNF-alpha and IL-10 production and apoptosis induction in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was investigated. Membrane rafts participation in these responses was also evaluated. L. reuteri reduced by 29% the OTA inhibition of TNF-alpha production whereas L. acidophilus increased 8 times the TNF-alpha production by OTA treated-PBMC. Also, both bacteria reversed apoptosis induced by OTA by 32%. However, neither of the bacteria reversed the OTA inhibition on IL-10 production. On the other hand, the lactobacilli were less effective to reverse OTA effects on disrupted-rafts PBMC. This study shows that two lactobacilli strains can reduce some negative OTA effects, being membrane rafts integrity necessary to obtain better results. Also, the results highlight the potential capacity of some lactobacilli strains usually included in natural dietary components in milk-derived products and cereals feed, to reduce OTA toxicity once ingested by humans or animals.
TI  - Comparison of the kinetics of intestinal colonization by associating 5 probiotic  bacteria assumed either in a microencapsulated or in a traditional, uncoated form.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Beneficial findings concerning probiotics are increasing day by day.  However, one of the most important parameters able to significantly affect the probiotic value of a microorganism is its survival during the transit through the stomach and the duodenum. Some techniques may be applied that aim to improve this parameter, but microencapsulation of bacterial cells remains one of the most important. A recent study assessed the kinetics of intestinal colonization by a mixture of 2 probiotic strains, given either in a microencapsulated or in a traditional, uncoated form. METHODS: A comparison between the intestinal colonization by associating 5 microencapsulated bacteria and the same uncoated strains was performed by a double-blind, randomized, cross-over study. The study (December 2007 to January 2009) involved 53 healthy volunteers. In particular, subjects were divided into 2 groups: group A (27 subjects) was given a mix of probiotic strains Probiotical S.p.A. (Novara, Italy), Lactobacillus acidophilus LA02 (DSM 21717), Lactobacillus rhamnosus LR04 (DSM 16605), L. rhamnosus GG, or LGG (ATCC 53103), L. rhamnosus LR06 (DSM 21981), and Bifidobacterium lactis BS01 (LMG P-21384) in an uncoated form, whereas group B (26 subjects) received the same strains microencapsulated with a gastroprotected material. The uncoated strains were administered at 5x10(9) cfu/strain/d (a total of 25x10(9) cfu/d) for 21 days, whereas the microencapsulated bacteria were given at 1x10(9) cfu/strain/d (a total of 5x10(9) cfu/d) for 21 days. At the end of the first period of supplementation with probiotics, a 3-week wash-out phase was included in the study setting. At the end of the wash-out period, the groups crossed over their treatment regimen; that is, group A was administered the microencapsulated bacteria and group B the uncoated bacteria. The administered quantities of each strain were the same as the first treatment. A quantitative evaluation of intestinal colonization by probiotics, either microencapsulated or uncoated, was undertaken by examining fecal samples at the beginning of the study (time 0), after 10 days and after 21 days of each treatment period. In particular, fecal total Lactobacilli, heterofermentative Lactobacilli, and total Bifidobacteria were quantified at each checkpoint. A genomic analysis of an appropriate number of colonies was performed to quantify individual L. rhamnosus strains among heterofermentative Lactobacilli. RESULTS: A statistically significant increase in the fecal amounts of total Lactobacilli, heterofermentative Lactobacilli, and total Bifidobacteria was registered in both groups at the end of each supplementation period compared with d(0) or d(4)(2) (group A: P=0.0002, P=0.0001, and P<0.0001 at d(2)(1), P=0.0060, P=0.0069, and P<0.0001 at d(6)(3) for total Lactobacilli, heterofermentative Lactobacilli, and Bifidobacteria, respectively; group B: P=0.0002, P=0.0006, and P<0.0001 at d(2)(1), P=0.0015, P=0.0016, and P<0.0001 at d(6)(3) for total Lactobacilli, heterofermentative Lactobacilli, and Bifidobacteria, respectively), confirming the ability of each strain in the administered composition to colonize the human gut, whether supplemented in a gastroprotected or in a traditional freeze-dried form. On the contrary, subjects receiving microencapsulated bacteria reported a kinetics of intestinal colonization that was entirely comparable with those who were given uncoated strains at a 5 times higher amount. CONCLUSIONS: The microencapsulation technique used in this study is a valid approach aimed to significantly improve the survival of strains during gastroduodenal transit, thus enhancing their probiotic value and allowing the use of a 5 times lower amount.
TI  - Effectiveness of the association of 2 probiotic strains formulated in a slow release vaginal product, in women affected by vulvovaginal candidiasis: a pilot study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is the second most common cause of vaginitis after bacterial vaginosis, and it is diagnosed in up to 40% of women with vaginal complaints in the primary care setting. Among Candida spp., Candida albicans is the most common infectious agent. The treatment of choice for uncomplicated VVC is achieved with single-dose or short-course therapy in over 90% of cases. Several topical and oral drugs are available, without evidence for superiority of any agent or route of administration. In any case, most classic treatments are unable to significantly offer a protection against possible recurrences. In recent years, probiotics are emerging as a new strategy to counteract VVC. In fact, they are well known for their ability to lower intravaginal pH, thus establishing a barrier effect against many types of yeasts. Some strains are also able to exert additional and more focused antagonistic activities mediated by specific molecules such as hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins. For example, Lactobacillus fermentum LF5 (CNCM I-789) was successfully tested in 4 human trials involving a total of 340 women reporting VVC at enrollment. In any case, the way used to deliver probiotics to the vaginal environment represents a crucial point. The aim of this work was to first select 1 or more probiotic strains in vitro with an antagonistic activity on Candida yeasts and then to perform an in vivo human pilot study using an association of the most promising and active bacteria. METHODS: For this purpose, 2 probiotic strains Probiotical S.p.A (Italy) were selected based on their strong in vitro inhibition activity toward 4 particular Candida species, namely C. albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida krusei and subsequently tested in a human intervention pilot trial involving 30 women with VVC. The probiotics used, L. fermentum LF10 (DSM 19187) and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA02 (DSM 21717), were administered by means of slow release effervescent vaginal tablets (ActiCand 30 product). The main endpoint was the assessment of the establishment and maintenance of a barrier effect against Candida yeasts in women suffering from VVC. Thirty female subjects who were diagnosed with VVC by both microscopic examination and yeast culture were enrolled in the study and directed to apply a vaginal tablet once a day for 7 consecutive nights, followed by 1 tablet every 3 nights for a further 3-week application (acute phase) and, finally, 1 tablet per week to maintain a long-term vaginal colonization against possible recurrences. A medical examination of each patient was performed at enrollment (d(0)), at the end of the first 4 weeks of treatment (d(2)(8)), and at the end of the second month of relapse prevention (d(5)(6)). The visual and microscopic examination was always accompanied by microbiological analyses of vaginal swabs to assess the presence of Candida. A statistical comparison was made between d(2)(8), or d(5)(6), and d0, and between d(5)(6) and d(2)(8) to quantify the efficacy against possible recurrences. RESULTS: The administration of the product ActiCand 30 was able to significantly solve Candida yeast symptoms after 28 days in 26 patients out of 30 (corresponding to 86.6%, P<0.001). At the end of the second month, recurrences were recorded, albeit not particularly serious, in only 3 out of 26 patients (11.5%, P=0.083) who were found to have fully healed at the end of the first month of treatment. This is a further confirmation of the long-term barrier effect exerted by the product. CONCLUSIONS: VVC has a very high incidence as 70% to 75% of women report at least 1 episode during the life. Many treatments are currently available but, despite a relatively high effectiveness in the relief of symptoms typically associated with acute infections, they are generally unable to offer a long-term protective barrier against possible recurrences. This study demonstrated the ability of ActiCand 30 to not only solve Candida infections in a very high percentage of women, but also to exert a long-term physiological defense due to the colonization of vaginal microbiota and adhesion of the mucosa to the epithelial cells. The special formulation of ActiCand 30, consisting of slow release effervescent vaginal tablets, is able to mediate 2 types of barrier effects, the first represented by the formation of an anaerobic environment due to the release of CO(2) and the second guaranteed by the colonization and adhesion to the vaginal epithelium of the 2 probiotics L. fermentum LF10 and L. acidophilus LA02.
TI  - Differential cytokine expression in T-cell subsets of chicken caecal tonsils co-cultured with three species of Lactobacillus.
AB  - Members of the intestinal microbiota play an important role in the development of T-cells. Little is known about responses of intestinal T-cell subsets of chickens to commensal bacteria. Therefore, we set out to characterise cytokine responses in T-cells after exposure to lactobacilli. Caecal tonsil mononuclear cells were isolated and co-cultured with Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus salivarius for 12 hours. Subsequently the CD4+ and CD8+ cells were fractionated by flow cytometry and the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines as well as Toll-like receptor 21 (TLR21) was determined. The results demonstrated that chicken CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells express TLR21 and that the various isolates of lactobacilli differentially induces the expression of interleukin 10, interferon-gamma and transforming growth factor beta. Our results demonstrate that different Lactobacillus species have the capacity to regulate intestinal T-cell responses and that these responses may be important to intestinal homeostasis.
TI  - Protection of probiotic bacteria in a synbiotic matrix following aerobic storage  at 4 degrees C.
AB  - The survival of single strains of Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium longum,  Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus reuteri was investigated in synbiotics that included 10 mg/ml of fructo-oligosaccharides, inulin and pectic-oligosaccharides in an alginate matrix under refrigerated (4 degrees C) aerobic storage conditions. When the matrices were cross-linked with calcium (45 mM), 102-103 cfu/ml of L. acidophilus and L. reuteri, and 0-103 cfu/ml of B. breve and B. longum survived refrigerated aerobic storage for 28 days. Following refrigerated storage, acetic (3-9 mM), butyric (0-2 mM), propionic (5-16 mM) and lactic acids (1-48 mM) were produced during the growth of probiotics in BHI broth at 37 degrees C, suggesting their metabolic activity after storage was stressed. When calcium cross-linking was not used in synbiotics, the matrix remained more gel-like after inoculation when compared to the calcium cross-linked matrix. At least 107 cfu/ml of probiotic bacteria survived after 21 days of storage within these gel-like alginate matrices. Significantly higher levels of B. breve, L. acidophilus and L. reuteri were obtained from the synbiotic matrices supplemented with fructo-oligosaccharides, inulin and pectic-oligosaccharides compared to alginate alone. B. longum survival was the same (~7 logs) in all gel-like synbiotic matrices. These results show that synbiotics protected probiotic bacteria and extended their shelf-life under refrigerated aerobic conditions. Synbiotics represent a viable delivery vehicle for health-promoting bacteria.

TI  - [Efficacy of freeze-dried Lactobacilli in functional diarrhoe: a pilot study].
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The pathogenic role of the intestinal milieu for symptoms in functional bowel disorders such as functional diarrhea (FD) or associated pain and bloating in the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the rationale for probiotic treatment approaches. It was the aim of this pilot study to test the effects of a lyophilisate from devitalized lactobacilli and their culture medium in patients with chronic FD. METHODS: Following a one-week basal period, 22 patients mit FD (12 with IBS) were treated with Lacteol (2 capsules/day) for 4 weeks. Stool frequency, consistency (assessed by BSFS), urge, pain and bloating were recorded daily using a standardized symptom diary, and global relief was recorded weekly. RESULTS: Daily stool frequency and number of days with urge were significantly decreased starting in week 1 (-0.6 +/- 0.2/day; p = 0.005; and -1.3 +/- 0.3 days, respectively; p = 0.001). This effect persisted throughout week 4 (-0.6 +/- 0.2/day; p< 0.02; and -1.4 +/- 0.5 days, respectively; p = 0.025). After 4 weeks, 50% of patients reported satisfactory symptom relief, including improvement in maximal stool consistency (BSFS: -0.3 +/- 0.2; p = 0.04), and 43% of patients recorded a decrease in stool frequency of >/= 25%. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest a clinically relevant efficacy of Lacteol in a subgroup of patients with FD, particularly with regard to stool frequency, urge and stool consistency. As the study design does not allow to exclude that a placebo component might have contributed to these effects, the results should be corroborated in an larger, placebo-controlled trial.
TI  - Fermentation of sugars and sugar alcohols by plaque Lactobacillus strains.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective was to analyse the ability of Lactobacillus strains isolated from supragingival plaque of subjects with hyposalivation and from healthy controls to ferment sugars and sugar alcohols. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty strains isolated from interproximal plaque from subjects with radiation-induced hyposalivation (25 strains), subjects with primary Sjogren's syndrome (16 strains) and from subjects with normal salivary secretion rate (9 strains) were tested. Growth and pH were determined after 24 and 48 h of anaerobic incubation in vials containing basal media with 1 % of glucose, fructose, sucrose, mannitol, sorbitol or xylitol. RESULTS: No differences between strains isolated from hyposalivated subjects and controls were detected. All strains lowered the pH to <5.0 from fructose and the majority of the strains from glucose and sucrose. A pH of <5.5 was seen for 52 % of the strains using mannitol, 50 % using sorbitol and 36 % using xylitol. The ability to produce acids from sugars and sugar alcohols was highest among strains of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus paracasei and lowest among Lactobacillus fermentum strains. CONCLUSION: A large number of Lactobacillus strains are able to ferment not only sugars but also the sugar substitutes mannitol, sorbitol and xylitol to pH levels critical for enamel demineralisation. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our findings suggest that products containing mannitol, sorbitol and/or xylitol may contribute to the acidogenic potential of the dental plaque and especially in hyposalivated subjects with high numbers of lactobacilli.
TI  - Myosin-cross-reactive antigens from four different lactic acid bacteria are fatty acid hydratases.
AB  - The 67 kDa myosin-cross-reactive antigen (MCRA) is a member of the MCRA family of proteins present in a wide range of bacteria and was predicted to have fatty acid isomerase function. We have now characterised the catalytic activity of MCRAs from four LAB stains, including Lactobacillus rhamnosus LGG, L. plantarum ST-III, L. acidophilus NCFM and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12. MCRA genes from these strains were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant protein function was analysed with lipid profiles by GC-MS. The four MCRAs catalysed the conversion of linoleic acid and oleic acid to their respective 10-hydroxy derivatives, which suggests that MCRA proteins catalyse the first step in conjugated linoleic acid production. This is the first report of MCRA from L. rhamnosus with such catalytic function.
TI  - Probiotic viability and physico-chemical and sensory properties of plain and stirred fruit yogurts made from goat's milk.
AB  - Probiotic plain and stirred fruit yogurts were made from goat's milk using bacterial cultures comprising, Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 and Propionibacterium jensenii 702. The products were stored at 4 degrees C for 4weeks, during which time the viability of the yogurt starter culture and probiotic bacteria was analysed weekly. P. jensenii 702 demonstrated the highest viability (10(8)cfu/g) in all types of yogurt throughout the storage period, while the viability of the bifidobacteria ( approximately 10(7)cfu/g) also remained above the minimum therapeutic level. The viability of L. acidophilus LA-5 fell below 10(6)cfu/g in yogurts, however, the addition of fruit juice appeared to support the viability of lactobacilli, with higher microorganism numbers observed in fruit yogurts than in plain yogurt throughout the shelf life. Addition of fruit juice significantly increased the syneresis, and decreased viscosity and water holding capacity of yogurts (p<0.05), and also enhanced their sensory acceptability.
TI  - [Interaction of Bifidobacterium bifidum with members of normal microflora in human intestine microsymbiocenosis].
AB  - AIM: Study the influence of exometabolites of B. bifidum on biological properties of bacteria that are the members of normoflora and their ability to interact with associative microsymbionts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bacterial strains that are members of the normal microflora of human intestine: B. bifidum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcusfaecium and Escherichia coli lactose positive non-hemolytic (lac "+"/hly "-") were used. As opportunistic microorganisms cultures of E. coli lactose negative hemolytic (lac "-"/hly "+"), Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus were used. Isolation and identification of microorganisms was performed by generally accepted methods according to guidances. In the first series of experiments influence of B. bifidum metabolites on biological properties of microorganisms that are members ofnormoflora was studied. In the second series--the influence of bifidobacteria supernatants on interrelations of B. bifidum, L. acidophilus and E. coli lac "+"/hly "-" with opportunistic associants. Growth properties (GP), biofilm formation (BFF) and anti-lysozyme activity (ALA) of microorganisms was studied photometrically. Optical density measurement were performed on ELx808 (BioTek, U.S.A.) photometer. The data obtained were treated by nonparametric method using Mann-Whitney criteria. RESULTS: B. bifidum supernatant was established to stimulate in 33.3-66.7% of cases or did not alter growth/reproduction, BFF and ALA of microorganisms that are characteristic for eubiosis of intestine including bacteria of the same species that could have implications for realization by bifidobacteria ofbiotope colonization resistance. Features of interaction ofexometabolites of bifidobacteria with microorganisms that are characteristic for eubiosis of human intestine consisting in enchantment or changes of effects of the influence of normoflora members on BFF of associants were revealed. The maximum enchantment of inhibitory effect of indigenous strains under the influence ofbifidobacteria was noted in associations E. coli lac "+"/hly "-" E. coli lac "-"/hly "+" as well as E. faecium--S. aureus. CONCLUSION: Thus, the data obtained may be used for detection of mechanisms of functioning of normal microsymbiocenosis in human associative symbiosis.
TI  - [Influence of corynebacteria metabolites on antagonistic activity of H2O2 producing lactobacilli].
AB  - AIM: Study combined influence of Corynebacterium genus bacteria metabolites and H2O2 producing lactobacilli on survival rate of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus acidophilus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ability to inhibit catalase of the test strains used and to reduce bactericidal effect of hydroxyl radical were determined in corynebacteria. H2O2 containing metabolites were obtained by cultivating lactobacilli in mineral medium, the amount of H2O2 was determined by oxidation of TMB by peroxidase. Bactericidal effect of lactobacilli metabolites for test strains treated by corynebacteria metabolites was evaluated by seeding results. Results. Inhibitio by corynebacteria metabolites of S. aureus catalase activity by 30-40% and E. coli catalase activ ity by 40-70% was shown. A reduction of bactericidal effect of hydroxyl radicals by corynebacteria metabolites by 30-35% for S. aureus, 38-42% for E. coli and 70-73% for L. acidophilus was noted. The enchantment of bactericidal effect of lactobacilli after treatment of the test strain by corynebacteria metabolites against S. aureus and E. coli manifested by reduction of the numbe of viable cells by 2-3 lg CFU. For L. acidophilus the bactericidal effect oflactobacilli metabolite in the same conditions reduced, and that led to the increase ofviability by 2-4 lg PFU. CONCLUSION: A conclusion on the possibility of regulation by associative bacteria the manifestations of antagonistic activity of H2O2 producing dominant microorganisms is made based on the data obtained.
TI  - Study of antimicrobial activity and atomic force microscopy imaging of the action mechanism of cashew tree gum.
AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the antimicrobial potential of two grades of cashew tree gum (crude and purified) against eight microorganisms and to analyze the mechanism of cashew tree gum antimicrobial action via atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging. The results indicated strong antimicrobial properties of pure cashew tree gum against all tested microorganisms, except for Candida albicans and Lactobacillus acidophilus. On the other hand crude cashew gum showed antimicrobial activity only against Gram-positive bacteria (MRSA, MSSA, Listeria innocua and Enterococcus faecium). Atomic force microscopy imaging showed that pure cashew tree gum lead to bacterial cell collapse. In conclusion cashew tree gum presented relevant antimicrobial activity against most of the studied bacteria, and the purification of the cashew gum affected its antimicrobial spectrum.
TI  - Fermented milk supplemented with probiotics and prebiotics can effectively alter  the intestinal microbiota and immunity of host animals.
AB  - Fermented milk supplemented with 2 probiotic strains, Bifidobacterium lactis Bi-07 and Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM, and a prebiotic, isomaltooligosaccharide, was orally administered to 100 healthy adults at 480 g/d for 2 wk in a randomized controlled trial. The fecal bacterial compositions of these subjects were examined by culture before and after the intervention. The same fermented milk was also orally fed to BALB/c mice, and immune as well as fecal bacteria analyses were conducted using the same culturing methods. After the intervention, increases in fecal bifidobacteria and lactobacilli were observed among the subjects compared with the subjects in the control group. In contrast, after the intervention, fecal enterobacilli were significantly decreased in the test group compared with the control group. The same effects on the composition of the intestinal microbiota were observed in mice. Furthermore, the tested mice were found to have significantly increased delayed-type hypersensitivity, plaque-forming cells, and half-hemolysis values after the intervention with the fermented milk. In summary, the synbiotic fermented milk containing probiotics and a prebiotic may contribute to improve intestinal health and may have a positive effect on the humoral and cell-mediated immunity of host animals.
TI  - The effect of NaCl substitution with KCl on Akawi cheese: chemical composition, proteolysis, angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitory activity, probiotic survival, texture profile, and sensory properties.
AB  - The effect of partial substitution of NaCl with KCl on Akawi cheese with probiotic bacteria was investigated during 30 d of storage at 4 degrees C. Chemical composition, the survival of probiotic and lactic acid bacteria, proteolytic activity, and texture profile analysis were analyzed and sensory analysis was carried out to determine the effects of substitution. No significant differences were observed in moisture, protein, fat, and ash contents among the experimental Akawi cheeses at the same storage period. Significant differences were observed in water-soluble nitrogen and phosphotungstic-soluble nitrogen between experimental cheeses at the same of storage period. No significant difference was observed in the growth of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus between experimental cheeses at the same storage period. However, the growth of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus was significantly affected among experimental cheeses. A significant difference was observed in soluble Ca among experimental cheeses at the same storage period. In general, no significant differences existed in hardness and adhesiveness among experimental cheeses at the same storage period. No significant differences existed in sensory attributes, including creaminess, bitterness, saltiness, sour-acid, and vinegar taste among experimental Akawi cheeses at the same storage period.
TI  - MyD88 drives the IFN-beta response to Lactobacillus acidophilus in dendritic cells through a mechanism involving IRF1, IRF3, and IRF7.
AB  - Type I IFNs are induced by pathogens to protect the host from infection and boost the immune response. We have recently demonstrated that this IFN response is not restricted to pathogens, as the Gram-positive bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus, a natural inhabitant of the intestine, induces high levels of IFN-beta in dendritic cells. In the current study, we investigate the intracellular pathways involved in IFN-beta upon stimulation of dendritic cells with L. acidophilus and reveal that this IFN-beta induction requires phagosomal uptake and processing but bypasses the endosomal receptors TLR7 and TLR9. The IFN-beta production is fully dependent on the TIR adapter molecule MyD88, partly dependent on IFN regulatory factor (IRF)1, but independent of the TIR domain-containing adapter inducing IFN-beta MyD88 adapter-like, IRF and IRF7. However, our results suggest that IRF3 and IRF7 have complementary roles in IFN-beta signaling. The IFN-beta production is strongly impaired by inhibitors of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and PI3K. Our results indicate that L. acidophilus induces IFN-beta independently of the receptors typically used by bacteria, as it requires MyD88, Syk, and PI3K signaling and phagosomal processing to activate IRF1 and IRF3/IRF7 and thereby the release of IFN-beta.

TI  - Effect of flavan-3-ols on the adhesion of potential probiotic lactobacilli to intestinal cells.
AB  - The effect of dietary flavan-3-ols on the adhesion of potential probiotic lactobacilli strains to intestinal cells was unraveled. The inhibitory activity of these compounds on intestinal cells was highlighted. The cytotoxic effect was shown to depend on both the compound's chemical structure (galloylation and polymerization) and degree of differentiation of intestinal cells. The effect of flavan-3-ols on bacteria adhesion differed greatly between compounds, strains, and intestinal cells. All flavan-3-ols inhibited significantly Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 and Lactobacillus plantarum IFPL379 adhesion except epigallocatechin gallate, which enhanced L. acidophilus LA-5 adhesion to Caco-2. Procyanidins B1 and B2 increased remarkably the adhesion of Lactobacillus casei LC115 to HT-29 cells, whereas epigallocatechin increased L. casei LC115 adhesion to Caco-2. These data showed the potential of flavan-3-ols to alter gut microecology by modifying adhesion of lactobacilli strains to intestinal cells.
TI  - [The influence of probiotic fermented milk product on colon microbiota, hematological parameters and cell immunity in rats].
AB  - Influence of probiotic fermented milk product on the intestinal microbiota, hematological parameters and immune status of the experiment in vivo at Wistar rats was studied. It was shown, that entering of probiotic strains of Bifidobacterium bifidum 791, Bifidobacterium longum B-379M and Lactobacillus acidophilus NK1 u Streptococcus thermophilus in composition fermented milk products in the total quantity of 2,1 x 10(7) CFU/ sm3 in digestive tract within three weeks has a positive influence on the resident of colon microbiota. Significant increasing of population levels of Bifidobacterium, Enterobacteriaceae with normal biochemical properties, registered a strong tendency to increase the content of Lactobacteria, which led to a decreasing the number of potential pathogenic transient flora with pathogenic factors. Monitoring of body mass in experimental animals has shown that including of fermented milk product with probiotic strains in diet has a positive influence on the feed uptake. Probiotic properties of the product also have stimulated effect on the immune status of the rat: improvements in cell immunity (increasing the relative amount of T-helper cells, immuneregulatory index) and hematological parameters (increase
TI  - Effect of basal hormone profile on the formation of the vaginal bacterial cenosis in women.
AB  - Adhesion activity of L. acidophilus NK1, L. fermentum 90 TS4, and C. albicans 506 B on female vaginal epithelium was studied. Adhesion of various lactobacillus species was hormone-dependent. Adhesion of C. albicans 506 B was not associated with estrogen level. The effects of synthetic drugs and phytopreparations used for hormone replacement on adhesion of vaginal microbiocenosis members varied.
TI  - Is primary prevention of Clostridium difficile infection possible with specific probiotics?
AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of probiotics for the prevention of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is highly controversial, particularly with regard to the prevention of recurrent CDI. We hypothesize that primary prevention of CDI among patients receiving antibiotics might be a more achievable goal for probiotics than prevention in patients with previous CDI where the host flora is markedly altered. METHODS: We conducted a literature search for randomized, placebo-controlled efficacy studies of probiotic use among adults receiving antibiotics, in which CDI was one of the outcomes measured. In addition, we conducted meta-analyses of probiotics that were included in more than one randomized trial. RESULTS: Eleven studies were identified; most were seriously underpowered to determine the efficacy of probiotics in the prevention of CDI. Two showed significantly lower rates of CDI among the probiotic recipients. A meta-analysis of three studies that used the probiotic combination Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285 and Lactobacillus casei LBC80R and a combined analysis of those studies with four studies that used Saccharomyces boulardii, showed lower CDI rates in recipients of probiotics compared with recipients of placebo (risk ratio=0.39; 95% confidence interval 0.19-0.79). CONCLUSIONS: While potential flaws in study design were identified, a review of the available literature suggests that the primary prevention of CDI with specific probiotic agents may be achievable. Additional studies of sufficient size and with rigorous design are needed to confirm these findings.
TI  - Nature of bacterial colonization influences transcription of mucin genes in mice  during the first week of life.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postnatal regulation of the small intestinal mucus layer is potentially important in the development of adult gut functionality. We hypothesized that the nature of bacterial colonization affects mucus gene regulation in early life.We thus analyzed the influence of the presence of a conventional microbiota as well as two selected monocolonizing bacterial strains on the transcription of murine genes involved in mucus layer development during the first week of life.Mouse pups (N = 8/group) from differently colonized dams: Germ-free (GF), conventional specific pathogen free (SPF), monocolonized with either Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM (Lb) or Escherichia coli Nissle (Ec) were analyzed by qPCR on isolated ileal tissue sections from postnatal days 1 and 6 (PND1, PND6) after birth with respect to: (i) transcription of specific genes involved in mucus production (Muc1-4, Tff3) and (ii) amounts of 16S rRNA of Lactobacillus and E. coli. Quantification of 16S rRNA genes was performed to obtain a measure for amounts of colonized bacteria. RESULTS: We found a microbiota-independent transcriptional increase of all five mucus genes from PND1 to PND6. Furthermore, the relative level of transcription of certain mucus genes on PND1 was increased by the presence of bacteria. This was observed for Tff3 in the SPF, Ec, and Lb groups; for Muc2 in SPF; and for Muc3 and Muc4 in Ec and Lb, respectively.Detection of bacterial 16S rRNA genes levels above the qPCR detection level occurred only on PND6 and only for some of the colonized animals. On PND6, we found significantly lower levels of Muc1, Muc2 and Muc4 gene transcription for Lb animals with detectable Lactobacillus levels as compared to animals with Lactobacillus levels below the detection limit. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our data show that development of the expression of genes encoding secreted (Muc2/Tff3) and membrane-bound (Muc1/Muc3/Muc4) mucus regulatory proteins, respectively, is distinct and that the onset of this development may be accelerated by specific groups of bacteria present or absent at the mucosal site.
TI  - Growth performance, meat yield, oxidative stability, and Fatty Acid composition of meat from broilers fed diets supplemented with a medicinal plant and probiotics.
AB  - The experiment was carried out to investigate the effects of Alisma canaliculatum with probiotics (ACP) on the growth performance, meat composition, oxidative stability, and fatty acid composition of broiler meat. Sixteen probiotic strains were tested for their levels of acid, bile, and heat tolerance. Among them, Lactobacillus acidophilus KCTC 3111, Enterococcus faecium KCTC 2022, Bacillus subtilis KCTC 3239, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae KCTC 7928 were selected for use in ACP. Exactly 140 Ross broiler chicks were assigned to four dietary treatments in five replications for 5 wks in a completely randomized design. The dietary treatments were NC (Negative control; basal diet), PC (Positive control; basal diet with 0.005% Chlortetracycline), ACP-0.5% (basal diet with 0.5% ACP powder), and ACP-1% (basal diet with 1% ACP powder). According to the results, body weight of the broilers increased, and feed conversion ratio improved in the ACP-0.5% group compared to the NC group (p<0.05). Crude protein content of breast meat was higher (p<0.05) in the ACP-0.5% group, whereas crude fat content of thigh meat was lower (p<0.05) in the supplemented groups. Breast meat absolute and relative weights were both higher (p<0.05) in the ACP groups compared to the control group. Further, ACP diets increased gizzard and decreased large intestine relative weights, whereas kidney relative weight decreased upon the addition of a higher level (1%) of ACP (p<0.05). Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances values of breast and thigh meats were reduced (p<0.05) by ACP supplementation compared to control. Regarding the fatty acid composition of breast meat, arachidonic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, PUFA, and n6 fatty acid levels decreased (p<0.05) in the ACP groups, whereas the levels of linoleic acid, PUFA, PUFA/SFA, and n6 fatty acid in thigh meat decreased (p<0.05) by ACP and PC diets. It can be suggested based on the study results that ACP-0.5% diet could be an effective feed additive for broilers.
TI  - Improved production of chitin from shrimp waste by fermentation with epiphytic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The epiphytic Lactobacillus acidophilus SW01 isolated from shrimp waste (SW) was  used in SW fermentation. During the fermentation the lag phase of SW01 was hardly observed. The pH of the fermentation broth decreased to 3.86 within 12h and reached the lowest point at 3.73 after 48 h. This indicates a quick and deep acidification process by SW01. Besides, SW01 was observed to have high protease activity. As a result, the minerals and protein in SW were quickly removed with their contents decreasing to 0.73% and 7.8% respectively after 48 h fermentation. In the pilot scale fermentation, the pH was 3.99 and 3.86 respectively after 12 and 24 h fermentation. The mineral and protein contents were 0.98% and 8.44% respectively after 48 h fermentation. The residue of the fermented SW contains less than 1% minerals and can be easily transformed into chitin by a mere bleaching treatment.
TI  - Dominance of Lactobacillus acidophilus in the facultative jejunal Lactobacillus microbiota of fistulated beagles.
AB  - Lactobacilli were isolated from jejunal chyme from five fistulated beagles. Cultivable lactobacilli varied from 10(4) to 10(8) CFU/ml. Seventy-four isolates were identified by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing and differentiated by repetitive element PCR (Rep-PCR), Lactobacillus acidophilus was dominant, and nearly 80% of 54 isolates shared the same DNA fingerprint pattern.
TI  - Transcriptional response of Lactobacillus acidophilus L-92 after attachment to epithelial Caco-2 cells.
AB  - Transcriptome analysis showed that Lactobacillus acidophilus L-92 cells having anti-allergy effects on human up-regulated 41 genes involved permease, ABC transporter, proteinase and transcriptional regulator after attached to epithelial Caco-2 cells. Inversely, 37 genes were down-regulated, including ATP synthases, ABC transporters and transcriptional regulators.
TI  - Cost/benefit of synbiotics in acute infectious gastroenteritis: spend to save.
AB  - The cost/benefit ratio of probiotics in the ambulatory treatment of acute infectious gastro-enteritis with or without a synbiotic food supplement (containing fructo-oligosaccharides and probiotic strains of Streptoccoccus thermophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium lactis and Bifidobacterium infantis) has been studied. 111 children (median age 37 and 43 months for the synbiotic and placebo group, respectively) with acute infectious gastroenteritis were included in a randomised, prospective placebo-controlled trial performed in primary health care. All children were treated with an oral rehydration solution and with the synbiotic food supplement (n=57) or placebo (n=54). Physicians were allowed to prescribe additional medication according to what they considered as 'necessary'. Cost of add-on medication and total healthcare cost were calculated. Median duration of diarrhoea was 1 day shorter (95% confidence interval -0.6 to -1.9 days) in the symbiotic than in the placebo group (P<0.005). Significantly more concomitant medication (antibiotics, antipyretics, antiemetics) was prescribed in the placebo group (39 prescriptions in 28 patients) compared to the synbiotic group (12 prescriptions in 7 patients) (P<0.001). The difference was most striking for antiemetics: 28 vs. 5 prescriptions. The cost of add-on medication in the placebo group was evaluated at euro 4.04/patient (median 4.97 (interquartile (IQ) 25-75: 0-4.97)) vs. euro 1.13 /patient in the synbiotic arm (P<0.001). If the cost of the synbiotic is considered, median cost raised to euro 7.15/patient (IQ 25-75: 7.15-7.15) (P<0.001). The extra consultations needed to prescribe the concomitant medication resulted in a higher health care cost in the placebo group (euro 14.41 vs. euro 10.74/patient, P<0.001). Synbiotic food supplementation resulted in a 24 h earlier normalisation of stool consistency. Although use of the synbiotic supplementation increased cost, add-on medication and extra consultations were reduced, resulting in a reduction of health care cost of 25%.
TI  - [Refinement of taxonomic position of Lactobacillus genus probiotic strains by 16S rDNA and rpoA gene sequencing].
AB  - AIM: Revision of the species identification of collection lactobacilli strains based on 16S rDNA and rpoA gene sequencing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 52 lactobacilli cultures that present mostly Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology (GIMC) collection were studied. 16S rDNA gene fragments were amplified by using Lb16a, Lb16b, 16S-midford, 16S-midrev primers. 2 different reverse primers were used for the analysis of rpoA gene depending on lactobacilli species. DNA fragments sequencing was performed with 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems/Hitachi) with primers used for amplification. RESULTS: The effectiveness of sequencing of 2 targets for differentiation of species within lactobacilli phylogenetic groups was shown. Species diversity was demonstrated for GIMC lactobacilli strain collection that includes members of 9 species. All the strains marked previously as L. acidophilus were determined to belong to L. helveticus. Strains belonging to recently discovered L. farraginis species that has promising application in agriculture were detected. CONCLUSION: Genetic passports of original strains of 9 species of lactobacilli that are promising for further research.
TI  - Cholesterol-lowering activity of lactic acid bacteria probiotic strains in vivo.
AB  - Cholesterol-lowering activity of probiotic strains of lactic acid bacteria genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in the in vivo experiments on the model of experimental hypercholesterolemia in mice was studied. It is established that the prophylactic scheme of introduction of probiotic cultures is more effective than therapeutic one for the manifestation of cholesteraze activity of probiotic cultures. The most effective were the cultures: L. acidophilus and B. bifidum, as well as the composition B. bifidum + B. longum. Cholesterol-lowering activity of the studied strains and their compositions in this experiment ranged between 40-78%. It is noted that cholesteraze activity of other studied strains was not lower and in some cases, higher than that of most of the drugs currently used in cholesterinozis.
TI  - Antioxidant properties of potentially probiotic bacteria: in vitro and in vivo activities.
AB  - Thirty-four strains of lactic acid bacteria (seven Bifidobacterium, 11 Lactobacillus, six Lactococcus, and 10 Streptococcus thermophilus) were assayed in vitro for antioxidant activity against ascorbic and linolenic acid oxidation (TAA(AA) and TAA(LA)), trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), intracellular glutathione (TGSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Wide dispersion of each of TAA(AA), TAA(LA), TEAC, TGSH, and SOD occurred within bacterial groups, indicating that antioxidative properties are strain specific. The strains Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis DSMZ 23032, Lactobacillus acidophilus DSMZ 23033, and Lactobacillus brevis DSMZ 23034 exhibited among the highest TAA(AA), TAA(LA), TEAC, and TGSH values within the lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. These strains were used to prepare a potentially antioxidative probiotic formulation, which was administered to rats at the dose of 10(7), 10(8), and 10(9) cfu/day for 18 days. The probiotic strains colonized the colon of the rats during the trial and promoted intestinal saccharolytic metabolism. The analysis of plasma antioxidant activity, reactive oxygen molecules level, and glutathione concentration, revealed that, when administered at doses of at least 10(8) cfu/day, the antioxidant mixture effectively reduced doxorubicin-induced oxidative stress. Probiotic strains which are capable to limit excessive amounts of reactive radicals in vivo may contribute to prevent and control several diseases associated with oxidative stress.
TI  - Restoring specific lactobacilli levels decreases inflammation and muscle atrophy  markers in an acute leukemia mouse model.
AB  - The gut microbiota has recently been proposed as a novel component in the regulation of host homeostasis and immunity. We have assessed for the first time the role of the gut microbiota in a mouse model of leukemia (transplantation of BaF3 cells containing ectopic expression of Bcr-Abl), characterized at the final stage by a loss of fat mass, muscle atrophy, anorexia and inflammation. The gut microbial 16S rDNA analysis, using PCR-Denaturating Gradient Gel Electrophoresis and quantitative PCR, reveals a dysbiosis and a selective modulation of Lactobacillus spp. (decrease of L. reuteri and L. johnsonii/gasseri in favor of L. murinus/animalis) in the BaF3 mice compared to the controls. The restoration of Lactobacillus species by oral supplementation with L. reuteri 100-23 and L. gasseri 311476 reduced the expression of atrophy markers (Atrogin-1, MuRF1, LC3, Cathepsin L) in the gastrocnemius and in the tibialis, a phenomenon correlated with a decrease of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin-4, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, quantified by multiplex immuno-assay). These positive effects are strain- and/or species-specific since L. acidophilus NCFM supplementation does not impact on muscle atrophy markers and systemic inflammation. Altogether, these results suggest that the gut microbiota could constitute a novel therapeutic target in the management of leukemia-associated inflammation and related disorders in the muscle.
TI  - Construction and immunological evaluation of dual cell surface display of HIV-1 gag and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium FliC in Lactobacillus acidophilus for vaccine delivery.
AB  - Oral vaccines that elicit a mucosal immune response may be effective against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) because its transmission occurs mainly at the mucosa. The aim of this study was to construct recombinant Lactobacillus for oral delivery of oral vaccines against HIV-1 and to evaluate their immunogenicity. A recombinant Lactobacillus acidophilus strain expressing the HIV-1 Gag on the bacterial cell surface was established by fusion with the signal peptide and anchor motif of a mucus binding protein (Mub) from L. acidophilus with or without coexpression of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium flagellin (FliC) fused to a different Mub signal peptide and anchor. Using HEK293 cells engineered to express Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5), the biological activity of FliC on the bacterial cell surfaces was determined. The surface-exposed flagellin retained its TLR5-stimulating activity, suggesting that the recombinant strain with Gag and FliC dual display might provide a different immunopotency than the strain expressing only Gag. The immunological properties of the recombinant strains were assessed by coculture with human myeloid dendritic cells (DCs). The heterologous antigens on the cell surface affected maturation and cytokine responses of DCs. Acquired immune responses were also investigated by intragastric immunization of mice. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay showed induction of gamma interferon-producing cells at local mucosa after immunization of mice with the Gag-producing strain. Meanwhile, the immunization with L. acidophilus displaying both Gag and FliC resulted in an increase of Gag-specific IgA-secreting cells. These results suggested that the Gag-displaying L. acidophilus elicited specific immune responses and the coexistence of FliC conferred an adjuvant effect on local IgA production.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus strains isolated from honey marketed in Malaysia against selected multiple antibiotic resistant (MAR) Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - A total of 32 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from 13 honey samples commercially marketed in Malaysia, 6 strains identified as Lactobacillus acidophilus by API CHL50. The isolates had antibacterial activities against multiple antibiotic resistant's Staphylococcus aureus (25 to 32 mm), Staphylococcus epidermis (14 to 22 mm) and Bacillus subtilis (12 to 19 mm) in the agar overlay method after 24 h incubation at 30 degrees C. The crude supernatant was heat stable at 90 degrees C and 121 degrees C for 1 h. Treatment with proteinase K and RNase II maintained the antimicrobial activity of all the supernatants except sample H006-A and H010-G. All the supernatants showed antimicrobial activities against target bacteria at pH 3 and pH 5 but not at pH 6 within 72 h incubation at 30 degrees C. S. aureus was not inhibited by sample H006-A isolated from Libyan honey and sample H008-D isolated from Malaysian honey at pH 5, compared to supernatants from other L. acidophilus isolates. The presence of different strains of L. acidophilus in honey obtained from different sources may contribute to the differences in the antimicrobial properties of honey.
TI  - Physicochemical and hygienic effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus in Iranian white cheese.
AB  - Increasing incidence of food-borne disease along with its social and economic consequences have led to conducting extensive research in order to produce safer food and develop new antimicrobial agents; among them, extensive use of probiotics and bacteriocins as biological additives is of significant importance. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the interactions (growth behavior and survival) of Listeria monocytogenes and Lactobacillus acidophilus in various stages of production, ripening and storage of Iranian white cheese. Changes in pH values at different stages of cheese ripening, along with changes in organoleptic properties of cheese were also assessed. Compared to other treatments, in the treatment of cheese with probiotic agent without starter, the most significant decrease in Listeria monocytogenes count at the end of ripening stage was observed (3.16 Log per gram cheese compared with the control group) (p < 0.05). Survival of probiotic bacteria in control samples of cheese were significantly higher when compared to cheese sample contaminated with Listeria (p < 0.05). White probiotic cheese with starter had the highest of sensory acceptability (p < 0.05). Listeria Monocytogenes count decreased during ripening period of probiotic white cheese but the bacteria survived in probiotic white cheese. Lactobacillus acidophilus count decreased during ripening period of white cheese but it did not lower to less than 10(6) CFU per g at the end of ripening and storage periods.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of a new haemostatic agent on oral microorganisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the antibacterial effect of a newly developed haemostatic agent Ankaferd Blood Stopper(R) (ABS) and Ferric Sulphate (FS) on various oral microorganisms. STUDY DESIGN: Bacterial strains were freshly incubated in their specific broth media. For each of the strains, 3 wells per each agent, with a 5 mm diameter were made under aseptic conditions in the specific agar media. Then they were filled with a test agents or 0.2% chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) (control group). After 24h and 48h incubation periods, inhibition zones were measured. RESULTS: ABS showed antibacterial effect on all test microorganisms except Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus salivarius. Ferric sulphate and CHX have antibacterial effect on all microorganisms. When the test agents compared, the inhibition zones of the ABS were found smaller than the ferric sulphate and CHX. CONCLUSIONS: Although ferric sulphate and ABS have antibacterial effect, ferric sulphate had better antibacterial activity than ABS on oral microorganisms under in vitro condition. FS and ABS not only exhibit the haemostatic activity but also antimicrobial activity. Key words:Ankaferd blood stopper, ferric sulphate, haemostatic agent, haemostasia, bleeding, bactericide.
TI  - Infectious endocarditis caused by Lactobacillus acidophilus in a patient with mistreated dental caries.
AB  - We present a rare case of infectious endocarditis caused by Lactobacillus acidophilus in a patient on long-term steroid use for autoimmune hepatitis. In vitro susceptibility-guided antibiotics with benzylpenicillin plus clindamycin and successive mitral annuloplasty resulted in a favorable outcome. Infectious endocarditis was suspected to be a complication of mistreated periodontal infection. Maintenance of oral hygiene is important in immunocompromised patients.
TI  - Probiotic cheese attenuates exercise-induced immune suppression in Wistar rats.
AB  - Intense physical activity results in a substantial volume of stress and hence a significant probability of immunosuppression in athletes, with milk proteins being, perhaps, the most recommended protein supplements. Consumption of a probiotic cheese can attenuate immune suppression induced by exhausting exercise in rats. A popular Brazilian fresh cheese (Minas Frescal cheese) containing Lactobacillus acidophilus LA14 and Bifidobacterium longum BL05 was fed for 2wk to adult Wistar rats, which then were brought to exhaustion on the treadmill. Two hours after exhaustion, the rats were killed and material was collected for the determination of serum uric acid, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol fraction, total protein, triacylglycerols, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase, and blood cell (monocyte, lymphocyte, neutrophil, and leukocyte) counts. Exercise was efficient in reducing lymphocyte counts, irrespective of the type of ingested cheese, but the decrease in the group fed the probiotic cheese was 22% compared with 48% in the animals fed regular cheese. Monocyte counts were unaltered in the rats fed probiotic cheese compared with a significant decrease in the rats fed the regular cheese. Most importantly, ingestion of the probiotic cheese resulted in a >100% increase in serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and a 50% decrease in triacylglycerols. We conclude that probiotic Minas Frescal cheese may be a viable alternative to enhance the immune system and could be used to prevent infections, particularly those related to the physical overexertion of athletes.
TI  - Encapsulation of probiotic bacteria in lamb rennet paste: effects on the quality  of Pecorino cheese.
AB  - Lamb rennet pastes containing encapsulated Lactobacillus acidophilus and a mix of Bifidobacterium longum and Bifidobacterium lactis were produced for Pecorino cheese manufacture from Gentile di Puglia ewe milk. Cheeses were denoted as RP cheese when made with traditional rennet paste, RP-L cheese when made with rennet paste containing L. acidophilus culture, and RP-B cheese when made with rennet paste containing a mix of B. lactis and B. longum. Biochemical features of Pecorino cheese were studied at 1, 15, 30, 60, and 120 d of cheese ripening. The effect of encapsulation and bead addition to rennet acted on a different way on the viability of probiotic. Lactobacillus acidophilus retained its viability for 4 to 5 d and then showed a fast reduction; on the other hand, B. longum and B. lactis experienced kinetics characterized by an initial death slope, followed by a tail effect due to acquired resistance. At 1 d of ripening, the levels of L. acidophilus and bifidobacteria in cheese were the lowest, and then increased, reaching the highest levels after 30 d; such cell loads were maintained throughout the ripening for L. acidophilus, whereas bifidobacteria experienced a decrease of about 1 log cfu/g at the end of ripening. Enzymatic activities and biochemical features of cheeses were influenced by the type of rennet used for cheesemaking. Greater enzymatic activity was recorded in RP-L and RP-B cheese due to the presence of probiotic bacteria released from alginate beads. A positive correlation was found between enzymatic activities and water-soluble nitrogen and proteose-peptone in RP-B and RP-L cheeses; water-soluble nitrogen and proteose-peptone were the highest in RP-B. Principal component analysis distinguished RP-L from the other cheeses on the basis of the conjugated linoleic acid content, which was higher in the RP-L due to the ability of L. acidophilus to produce conjugated linoleic acid in the cheese matrix.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus could modulate the immune response against breast cancer in murine model.
AB  - Cancer immune-therapy is an interesting avenue of studying the effects of deviating immune system responses to achieve the desired result. Lactobacilli are inhabitants of the GI tract which have shown beneficial health effects on various ailments including malignancies. Their mechanisms of action comprise a very intense area of research. In this study we evaluated the immunomodulatory effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus in in vivo model of breast cancer. Lactobacillus acidophilus (L.a) was isolated from traditional home-made yogurt and also from neonatal stool by aerobic overnight culture at 37 degrees C in MRS broth. Delayed Type Hypersensitivity (DTH) assay was performed to find the best immunostimulant dose. 4T1 tumour bearing mice were treated with 2 x 10(8) cfu of isolated L. acidophilus and 20 mg/kg Cyclophosphamide for 15 consecutive days. Tumour volume was measured using a digital vernier calliper. Lymphocyte proliferation was done using MTT proliferation assay. Production of IFNgamma, IL-4 and TGF-beta from cultured Splenocytes was assessed in the presence of purified tumour antigen. According to results administration of L.a induced a significant decrease in tumour growth pattern (P value = 0.00). Significant alterations in splenocyte production of IFN-gamma, IL-4 and TGf-beta (P values < 0.05) and also lymphocyte proliferation in L.a treated animals was evident (P value < 0.05). This study indicated that oral administration of L.a is able to alter the cytokine production in tumour bearing mice into a Th1 protective pattern, favourable to anti tumour immunity. Reduced tumour growth rate and increased lymphocyte proliferation are also thus supportive. Further studies are required to elucidate the exact mechanism by which local actions of probiotics affect the systemic immune responses against transformed cells.
TI  - The prebiotic source influences the growth, biochemical features and survival under simulated gastrointestinal conditions of the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - The viability of the probiotic strain Lactobacillus acidophilus DSM 20079, after  its passage through the simulated gastric and pancreatic juices, was evaluated as function of its pre-growth in a medium containing the known prebiotics pectin or inulin, and was compared to glucose used as control. The presence of pectin or inulin did not affect the growth (12.11(log10) colony forming units/mL and 12.08(log10) colony forming units/mL for pectin and inulin respectively versus 12.22(log10) colony forming units/mL obtained for glucose). Pectin and inulin, in contrast to glucose, induced cell stress resistance against gastrointestinal juices (Delta(log10) 1 and 2 colony forming units/mL respectively, versus Delta(log10) 4.5 for glucose). The data were confirmed by the analysis of the protein pattern following stress treatments which, in the case of microbial cells grown with glucose, revealed a relevant protein degradation after the double passage through simulated gastric and intestinal juices. An impressive metabolic change, as function of the growth conditions, was demonstrated by analyzing the proteomic profile with a mu-2DE system, used herein for the first time as evaluation tool of prebiotic-probiotic interactions. The analysis revealed a different pH protein distribution that was mostly acidic in the presence of pectin and neutral-alkaline in the presence of inulin. Both prebiotics stimulated the production of butyrate, a relevant healthy bio-molecule not detectable in the presence of glucose, that was measured by HPLC analysis to be 14.5 fold higher after growth in the presence of inulin, as compared to pectin. Three specific proteins were detected at pH 6 after growth in the presence of pectin or inulin. They could be correlated to the stress resistance and/or to the production of butyrate, the common phenotypic characteristics induced in the bacterial strain by the two prebiotics.
TI  - [Clinical effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus strain L-55-contained yogurt on symptoms of Japanese cedar pollen allergy].
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been reported that oral administration of Lactobacillus acidophilus strain L-55 (L-55) suppressed nasal symptom and antigen-specific IgE induced by antigen challenge in mice. We investigated clinical effects of L-55-contained yogurt on symptoms and IgE production in the patients with Japanese cedar pollinosis. METHOD: The study was performed as a randomized double blind placebo-controlled trial. L-55-contained yogurt (L-55 yogurt) or placebo yogurt was started to administer to each subject from 4 weeks prior to the onset of Japanese cedar pollen release for total 13 weeks. RESULT: The mean value of symptom score and symptom medication score were lower in L-55 yogurt group compared with placebo yogurt group during 5th week to 9th week from the first week of Japanese cedar pollination. Especially, in medicated subjects, total symptom score and throat symptom score were significantly lower in L-55 yogurt group compared with placebo yogurt group at 5th and 4th week from the first week of Japanese cedar pollination, respectively. Moreover, in medicated subjects, change ratio of serum total IgE was significantly lower in L-55 yogurt group compared with placebo yogurt group at 1st week from the first week of Japanese cedar pollination. CONCLUSION: Intake of L-55 during Japanese cedar pollinating season may be effective in alleviating the allergic symptoms related to Japanese cedar pollinosis. From these finding, it was suggested that L-55 is a possible candidate as a complementary medicine for Japanese cedar pollinosis.
TI  - Efficacy of a vaccine and a direct-fed microbial against fecal shedding of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in a randomized pen-level field trial of commercial feedlot cattle.
AB  - Our primary objective was to determine the efficacy of a siderophore receptor and porin proteins-based vaccine (VAC) and a Lactobacillus acidophilus-based direct-fed microbial (DFM) against fecal shedding of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in commercial feedlot cattle fed a corn grain-based diet with 25% distiller's grains. Cattle projected to be on a finishing diet during the summer were randomly allocated into 40 study pens within ten blocks based on allocation dates. Blocks were complete; each of the four pens within a block was randomly assigned one treatment: control, VAC, DFM, or VAC+DFM. The DFM was fed (10(6)CFU/animal/day of Lactobacillus) throughout the study periods (84-88 days) and cattle were vaccinated at enrollment and again three weeks later. Fresh fecal samples (30/pen) from pen floors were collected weekly for four consecutive weeks (study days 52-77). Two concurrent culture procedures were used to enable estimates of E. coli O157:H7 shedding prevalence and prevalence of high shedders. From 4800 total samples, 1522 (31.7%) were positive for E. coli O157:H7 and 169 (3.5%) were considered high shedders. Pen-level linear mixed models were used for data analyses. There were no significant interactions among treatments and time of sampling. However, vaccinated pens had lower (P<0.01) overall prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 (model-adjusted mean +/- SEM=17.4 +/- 3.95%) and lower (P<0.01) prevalence of high shedders (0.95 +/- 0.26%) than unvaccinated pens (37.0 +/- 6.32% and 4.19 +/- 0.81%, respectively). There was no evidence of a DFM effect on either measure of E. coli O157:H7 shedding. Results indicate that a two-dose regimen of the vaccine significantly reduces fecal prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 (vaccine efficacy of 53.0%) and prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 high shedders (vaccine efficacy of 77.3%) in commercial feedlot cattle reared in the summer on a finishing diet with 25% distiller's grains.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria against Listeria monocytogenes on  frankfurters formulated with and without lactate/diacetate.
AB  - Contamination by Listeria monocytogenes has been a constant public health threat  for the ready-to-eat (RTE) meat industry due to the potential for high mortalities from listeriosis. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have shown protective action against various pathogenic bacteria. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antilisterial activity of a combination of three LAB strains (Lactiguard(R)) on L. monocytogenes. The combination of the LAB was inhibitory to L. monocytogenes inoculated onto frankfurters not containing lactate/diacetate after 8weeks of refrigerated storage (0.6 log reduction compared to L. monocytogenes only control), and when a cell free extract (CFS) of the LAB was added with LAB even more inhibition was obtained (1.2 log reduction compared with L. monocytogenes only). In frankfurters containing lactate/diacetate the LAB and the LAB plus CFS were more effective in reducing growth of L. monocytogenes after 8 weeks of refrigerated storage (2 and 3.3 log reductions respectively).
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of propolis on the microbiota from gastrointestinal tract of chickens.
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the effect of propolis extracts on the microbial colonization of chicken gastrointestinal tract in vivo. The propolis was administered to both feed mixtures in various amounts except of the control group. The addition of 150 mg propolis to 1 kg of feed was included in the first experimental group, the addition of 450 mg.kg(-1) in the second experimental group, the addition of 600 mg.kg(-1) the third experimental group and 800 mg kg(-1) in the fourth one. The highest count of faecal enterococci was found in the third group (8.6 cfu.g(-1)) where 600 mg of propolis to 1 kg was added to the feed mixture. The highest count of lactobacilli was detected in the fourth experimental group (8.83 cfu.g(-1)) where was 800 mg of propolis added to 1 kg of feed mixture and number of Enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in control group (8.73 cfu.g(-1)). With RTQ PCR detected species from the genus Enterococcus were: E. avium, E. casseliflavus, E cecorum, E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. gallinarum, E. hirae and E. malodoratus and from genus Lactobacillus were: Lactobacillus crispatus, L. acidophilus and L. salivarius. With MALDI TOF MS Biotyper from Enterobacteriaceae genera were identified Citrobacter braakii, Raoultella ornithinolytica, Serratia fonticola, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella oxytoca. Antimicrobial activities In vitro of six species of bacteria isolated from gastrointestinal tract of chickens were also tested. The best antimicrobial effect of Citrobacter braakii on ethanolic propolis extract in all concentrations were found.
TI  - Photodynamic effects of curcumin against cariogenic pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND DATA: The presence of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus in dental structure is an indicator of a cariogenic biofilm. Photodynamic therapy is a technique that involves the activation of photosensitizers by light in the presence of oxygen, resulting in the production of reactive radicals capable of inducing cell death. Reduction of bacteria levels can provide additional means of preventing dental caries. OBJECTIVE: The present study evaluated the susceptibility of planktonic cultures of S. mutans (ATCC 25175) and L. acidophilus (ATCC-IAL-523) from the Adolfo Lutz Institute (IAL) to photodynamic therapy after sensitization with curcumin and exposure to blue light at 450 nm. METHODS: Bacterial suspensions of S. mutans and L. acidophilus isolated (as single species) and combined (multspecies) were prepared and then evaluated. Four different groups were analyzed: L-D- (control group), L-D+ (drug group), L+D- (light group), and L+D+ (photodynamic therapy group). Two different concentrations of curcumin were tested (0.75 and 1.5 g/L) associated with a 5.7 J/cm(2) light emission diode. RESULTS: Significant decreases (p<0.05) in the viability of S. mutans were only observed when the bacterial suspensions were exposed to both curcumin and light. Then, reductions in viability of up to 99.99% were observed when using 1.5 g/L of the photosensitizer. The susceptibility of L. acidophilus was considerably lower (21% and 37.6%) for both curcumin concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Photodynamic therapy was found to be effective in reducing S. mutans and L. acidophilus on planktonic cultures. No significant reduction was found for L-D+, proving the absence of dark toxicity of the drug.
TI  - Effects of bile salt deconjugation by probiotic strains on the survival of antibiotic-resistant foodborne pathogens under simulated gastric conditions.
AB  - This study was designed to evaluate the effects of bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains on the antibiotic susceptibility of antibiotic-sensitive and multiple antibiotic-resistant Salmonella Typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus. Eight probiotic strains, Bifidobacterium longum B6, Lactobacillus acidophilus ADH, Lactobacillus brevis KACC 10553, Lactobacillus casei KACC 12413, Lactobacillus paracasei ATCC 25598, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Leuconostoc mesenteroides KACC 12312, and Pediococcus acidilactici KACC 12307, were used to examine bile acid tolerance. The ability to deconjugate bile acids was evaluated using both thin-layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography. The antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out to determine the synergistic inhibitory activity of deconjugated bile acids. L. acidophilus, L. brevis, and P. acidilactici showed the most tolerance to the conjugated bile acids. P. acidilactici deconjugated glycocholic acid and glycodeoxycholate from 3.18 and 3.09 mM to the detection limits, respectively. The antibiotic susceptibility of selected foodborne pathogens was increased by increasing the concentration of deconjugated bile acids. The study results are useful for understanding the relationship between bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains and antibiotic susceptibility in the presence of deconjugated bile acids, and they may be useful for designing new probiotic-antibiotic combination therapy based on bile acid deconjugation.
TI  - Abating colon cancer polyposis by Lactobacillus acidophilus deficient in lipoteichoic acid.
AB  - An imbalance of commensal bacteria and their gene products underlies mucosal and, in particular, gastrointestinal inflammation and a predisposition to cancer. Lactobacillus species have received considerable attention as examples of beneficial microbiota. We have reported previously that deletion of the phosphoglycerol transferase gene that is responsible for lipoteichoic acid (LTA) biosynthesis in Lactobacillus acidophilus (NCK2025) rendered this bacterium able to significantly protect mice against induced colitis when delivered orally. Here we report that oral treatment with LTA-deficient NCK2025 normalizes innate and adaptive pathogenic immune responses and causes regression of established colonic polyps. This study reveals the proinflammatory role of LTA and the ability of LTA-deficient L. acidophilus to regulate inflammation and protect against colonic polyposis in a unique mouse model.
TI  - Enzymology and structure of the GH13_31 glucan 1,6-alpha-glucosidase that confers isomaltooligosaccharide utilization in the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM.
AB  - Isomaltooligosaccharides (IMO) have been suggested as promising prebiotics that stimulate the growth of probiotic bacteria. Genomes of probiotic lactobacilli from the acidophilus group, as represented by Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM, encode alpha-1,6 glucosidases of the family GH13_31 (glycoside hydrolase family 13 subfamily 31) that confer degradation of IMO. These genes reside frequently within maltooligosaccharide utilization operons, which include an ATP-binding cassette transporter and alpha-glucan active enzymes, e.g., maltogenic amylases and maltose phosphorylases, and they also occur separated from any carbohydrate transport or catabolism genes on the genomes of some acidophilus complex members, as in L. acidophilus NCFM. Besides the isolated locus encoding a GH13_31 enzyme, the ABC transporter and another GH13 in the maltooligosaccharide operon were induced in response to IMO or maltotetraose, as determined by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) transcriptional analysis, suggesting coregulation of alpha-1,6- and alpha-1,4-glucooligosaccharide utilization loci in L. acidophilus NCFM. The L. acidophilus NCFM GH13_31 (LaGH13_31) was produced recombinantly and shown to be a glucan 1,6-alpha-glucosidase active on IMO and dextran and product-inhibited by glucose. The catalytic efficiency of LaGH13_31 on dextran and the dextran/panose (trisaccharide) efficiency ratio were the highest reported for this class of enzymes, suggesting higher affinity at distal substrate binding sites. The crystal structure of LaGH13_31 was determined to a resolution of 2.05 A and revealed additional substrate contacts at the +2 subsite in LaGH13_31 compared to the GH13_31 from Streptococcus mutans (SmGH13_31), providing a possible structural rationale to the relatively high affinity for dextran. A comprehensive phylogenetic and activity motif analysis mapped IMO utilization enzymes from gut microbiota to rationalize preferential utilization of IMO by gut residents.
TI  - ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein) reduces bacterial attachment to human gastrointestinal LS174T epithelial cells.
AB  - The aim of this project was to show elevated P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression decreasing bacterial association with LS174T human gastrointestinal cells, and that this effect could be reversed upon blocking functional P-gp efflux. Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Lactobacillus acidophilus and numerous strains of Escherichia coli, from commensal to enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic strains (O157:H7) were fluorescently labelled and incubated on LS174T cultures either with or without P-gp amplification using rifampicin. PSC-833 was used as a potent functional P-gp blocking agent. Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas displayed the greatest association with the LS174T cells. Surprisingly, lactobacilli retained more fluorescence than enteropathogenic-E. coli in this system. Irrespective of attachment differences between the bacterial species, the increase in P-gp protein expression decreased bacterial fluorescence by 25-30%. This included the GFP-labelled E. coli, and enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (O157:H7). Blocking P-gp function through the co-administration of PSC-833 increased the amount of bacteria associated with P-gp expressing LS174T cells back to control levels. As most bacteria were affected to the same degree, irrespective of pathogenicity, it is unlikely that P-gp has a direct influence on adhesion of bacteria, and instead P-gp may be playing an indirect role by secreting a bank of endogenous factors or changing the local environment to one less suited to bacterial growth in general.
TI  - Improved bioavailability of dietary phenolic acids in whole grain barley and oat  groat following fermentation with probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus , Lactobacillus johnsonii , and Lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  - The aim of this study was to improve the bioavailability of the dietary phenolic  acids in flours from whole grain barley and oat groat following fermentation with lactic acid bacteria (LAB) exhibiting high feruloyl esterase activity (FAE). The highest increase of free phenolic acids was observed after fermentation with three probiotic strains, Lactobacillus johnsonii LA1, Lactobacillus reuteri SD2112, and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5, with maximum increases from 2.55 to 69.91 mug g(-1) DM and from 4.13 to 109.42 mug g(-1) DM in whole grain barley and oat groat, respectively. Interestingly, higher amounts of bound phenolic acids were detected after both water treatment and LAB fermentation in whole grain barley, indicating higher bioaccessibility, whereas some decrease was detected in oat groat. To conclude, cereal fermentation with specific probiotic strains can lead to significant increase of free phenolic acids, thereby improving their bioavailability.
TI  - Lactobacillus protected bone damage and maintained the antioxidant status of liver and kidney homogenates in female wistar rats.
AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate protective property of Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus in minimizing oxidative stress associated with arthritis from liver and kidney. Subsequently, protective property of Lactobacillus against the bone damage was also taken into consideration. Arthritis was induced by injecting freund's complete adjuvant (100 mul) into sub plantar surface of hind paw. Oral administration of culture, vehicle, and drug started after induction of arthritis (i.e. on day 9th). Indomethacin was used as a standard drug. Radiographic analysis of the hind paw knee joint was also done at the end of the 21st day. Oxidative stress parameters were studied from liver and kidney homogenate. Histopathology of liver and kidney was also performed. Lactobacillus treatment significantly rescued the enzymatic level of catalase, superoxide dismutase, reduced glutathione, and glutathione peroxidase in both liver and kidney homogenates, whereas it has decreased the malonaldehyde accumulation. Oral administration of Lactobacillus also significantly decreased the serum ceruloplasmin level. Radiographic analysis also corroborated these findings. Lactobacillus treatment maintained the normal histopathology of liver and kidney. Results of this study clearly suggest that L. casei and L. acidophilus, alone or in combination, decreased the bone damaged and effectively restored antioxidant status of liver and kidney. Lactobacillus has a significant antiarthritic and antioxidant activity against freund's complete adjuvant induced arthritis in rats.
TI  - Preparation and characterization of alginate and psyllium beads containing Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - This paper describes preparation and characterization of beads of alginate and psyllium containing probiotic bacteria of Lactobacillus acidophilus DMSZ20079. Twelve different formulations containing alginate (ALG) and alginate-psyllium (ALG-PSL) were prepared using extrusion technique. The prepared beads were characterized in terms of size, morphology and surface properties, encapsulation efficiency, viabilities in acid (pH 1.8, 2 hours) and bile (0.5% w/v, 2 hours) conditions, and release in simulated colon pH conditions. The results showed that spherical beads with narrow size distribution ranging from 1.59 +/- 0.04 to 1.67 +/- 0.09 mm for ALG and from 1.61 +/- 0.06 to 1.80 +/- 0.07 mm for ALG-PSL with encapsulation efficiency higher than 98% were achieved. Furthermore, addition of PSL into ALG enhanced the integrity of prepared beads in comparison with ALG formulations. The results indicated that incorporation of PSL into alginate beads improved viability of the bacteria in acidic conditions as well as bile conditions. Also, stimulating effect of PSL on the probiotic bacteria was observed through 20-hour incubation in simulated colonic pH solution. According to our in vitro studies, PSL can be a suitable polymer candidate for partial substitution with ALG for probiotic coating.
TI  - Comparative meta-analysis of the effect of Lactobacillus species on weight gain in humans and animals.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity is associated with alteration of the gut microbiota. In order to clarify the effect of Lactobacillus-containing probiotics (LCP) on weight we performed a meta-analysis of clinical studies and experimental models. We intended to assess effects by Lactobacillus species. METHODS: A broad search with no date or language restriction was performed. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and comparative clinical studies in humans and animals or experimental models assessing the effect of Lactobacillus-containing probiotics on weight. We primarily attempted to extract and use change from baseline values. Data were extracted independently by two authors. Results were pooled by host and by Lactobacillus species and are summarized in a meta-analysis of standardized difference in means (SMDs). RESULTS: We identified and included 17 RCTs in humans, 51 studies on farm animals and 14 experimental models. Lactobacillus acidophilus administration resulted in significant weight gain in humans and in animals (SMD 0.15; 95% confidence intervals 0.05-0.25). Results were consistent in humans and animals. Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus ingluviei were associated with weight gain in animals. Lactobacillus plantarum was associated with weight loss in animals and Lactobacillus gasseri was associated with weight loss both in obese humans and in animals. CONCLUSIONS: Different Lactobacillus species are associated different effects on weight change that are host-specific. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of Lactobacillus species in the human energy harvest and weight regulation. Attention should be drawn to the potential effects of commonly marketed lactobacillus-containing probiotics on weight gain.
TI  - Evaluation of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM encapsulated using a novel impinging aerosol method in fruit food products.
AB  - This study investigated the effect of microencapsulation on the survival of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and their acidification in orange juice at 25 degrees C for nine days and at 4 degrees C over thirty five days of storage. Alginate micro beads (10-40 mum) containing the probiotics were produced by a novel dual aerosol method of alginate and CaCl(2) cross linking solution. Unencapsulated L. rhamnosus GG was found to have excellent survivability in orange juice at both temperatures. However unencapsulated L. acidophilus NCFM showed significant reduction in viability. Encapsulation of these two bacteria did not significantly enhance survivability but did reduce acidification at 25 degrees C and 4 degrees C. In agreement with this, encapsulation of L. rhamnosus GG also reduced acidification in pear and peach fruit-based foods at 25 degrees C, however at 4 degrees C difference in pH was insignificant between free and encapsulated cells. In conclusion, L. rhamnosus GG showed excellent survival in orange juice and microencapsulation has potential in reducing acidification and possible negative sensory effects of probiotics in orange juice and other fruit-based products.
TI  - Antagonistic Action of Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria in Relation to Staphylococcus aureus and Their Influence on the Immune Response in Cases of Intravaginal Staphylococcosis in Mice.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus casei IMV B-7280, Lact. acidophilus IMV B-7279, Bifidobacterium longum VK1, and B. bifidum VK2 strains or their various compositions in relation to Staphylococcus aureus in vitro and on models of experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis of mice was determined. It was found that under the influence of these strains and their various compositions, the in vitro growth of Staph. aureus was inhibited, and the number of colonies of Staph. aureus plated from the vagina of infected mice was significantly reduced. The antibacterial activity of these strains separately and in compositions correlated with their ability to improve the performance of the immune response. These strains were the most effective in the following compositions: Lact. casei IMV B-7280-B. longum VK1-B. bifidum VK2. Strains of Lact. casei IMV B-7280, Lact. acidophilus IMV B-7279, B. bifidum VK2, and B. longum VK1 are prospective components of future probiotic drugs efficient in treating staphylococcosis and for immunity correction.
TI  - S-layer proteins of Lactobacillus acidophilus inhibits JUNV infection.
AB  - It has been previously described that S-layer binds to the C-type lectin DC-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN, CD209). It was also shown that DC-SIGN is a cell-surface adhesion factor that enhances viral entry of several virus families. Among those, Junin virus (JUNV) entry is enhanced in cells expressing DC-SIGN and for that reason surface-layer protein (S-layer) of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4365 was evaluated as a possible JUNV inhibitor. Experiments using 3T3 cells stably expressing DC-SIGN, showed an almost complete inhibition of JUNV infection when they were treated with S-layer in a similar extend as the inhibition shown by mannan. However no inhibition effect was observed in 3T3 wild type cells or in 3T3 cells expressing liver/lymph node-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin (L-SIGN or DC-SIGNR or CD209L). Treatments with S-layer during different times in the infection demonstrated that inhibition was only observed when S-layer was presented in early stages of the viral infection. This inhibition does not involve the classic recognition of mannose by this C-type lectin as the S-layer showed no evidence to be glycosylated. In fact, the highly basic nature of the S-layer (pI>9.5) seems to be involved in electrostatic interactions between DC-SIGN and S-layer, since high pH abolished the inhibitory effect on infection cause by the S-layer. In silico analysis predicts a Ca(2+)-dependant carbohydrate recognition domain in the SlpA protein. This novel characteristic of the S-layer, a GRAS status protein, contribute to the pathogen exclusion reported for this probiotic strain and may be applied as an antiviral agent to inhibit several kinds of viruses.
TI  - The in vitro antimicrobial activities of metabolites from lactobacillus strains on Candida species implicated in Candida vaginitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Research from developing countries, such as Nigeria, on Lactobacillus species in the female urogenital tract and their role as a barrier to vaginal infection is limited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the clinical biotherapeutic potential of indigenous Lactobacillus species. METHODS: Antimicrobial metabolites production were characterised using simple and easily reproducible qualitative and quantitative methods. The in vitro inhibitory effect of Lactobacillus antimicrobials on vulvovaginal candidiasis-associated Candida species was investigated using modified agar spot and agar well-diffusion methods. RESULTS: The maximum levels of lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and diacetyl from 20 vaginal Lactobacillus strains from diseased subjects were 1.46 mg/L, 1.36 mmol/L, and 1.72 mg/L respectively. From the 4 healthy subjects, the maximum level of lactic acid was 1.08 mg/L; hydrogen peroxide, 1.36 mmol/L; and diacetyl, 0.86 mg/L. The maximum productions of these substances occurred between 72 and 120 hours of incubation. The in vitro antagonistic activities of vaginal L. acidophilus, L. fermentum, L. brevis, L. plantarum, L. casei, L. delbrueckii, and L. jensenii from diseased subjects inhibited a maximum of 5.71% of the 35 Candida species tested, while vaginal L. acidophilus and L. plantarum from healthy subjects inhibited between 57.1% and 68.6% of Candida species in vitro. CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial-producing lactobacilli can be considered as adjunct biotherapeutic candidates for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis.
TI  - Caenorhabditis elegans immune conditioning with the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus strain NCFM enhances gram-positive immune responses.
AB  - Although the immune response of Caenorhabditis elegans to microbial infections is well established, very little is known about the effects of health-promoting probiotic bacteria on evolutionarily conserved C. elegans host responses. We found that the probiotic Gram-positive bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM is not harmful to C. elegans and that L. acidophilus NCFM is unable to colonize the C. elegans intestine. Conditioning with L. acidophilus NCFM significantly decreased the burden of a subsequent Enterococcus faecalis infection in the nematode intestine and prolonged the survival of nematodes exposed to pathogenic strains of E. faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus, including multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates. Preexposure of nematodes to Bacillus subtilis did not provide any beneficial effects. Importantly, L. acidophilus NCFM activates key immune signaling pathways involved in C. elegans defenses against Gram-positive bacteria, including the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (via TIR-1 and PMK-1) and the beta-catenin signaling pathway (via BAR-1). Interestingly, conditioning with L. acidophilus NCFM had a minimal effect on Gram-negative infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and had no or a negative effect on defense genes associated with Gram-negative pathogens or general stress. In conclusion, we describe a new system for the study of probiotic immune agents and our findings demonstrate that probiotic conditioning with L. acidophilus NCFM modulates specific C. elegans immunity traits.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Sesbania grandiflora flower polyphenol extracts on some pathogenic bacteria and growth stimulatory effect on the probiotic organism Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Polyphenolic extracts (PE) of edible flower of Sesbania grandiflora were tested to evaluate its antimicrobial effect against some common pathogenic bacteria and growth promoting property against probiotic organism Lactobacillus acidophilus. The antimicrobial activity of S. grandiflora flower PE against selected pathogens was evaluated using both in vitro and in situ methods. In vitro studies suggested that PE has inhibitory effect against Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella flexneri 2a, Salmonella Typhi, Escherichia coli and Vibrio cholerae. The gram-positive organism S. aureus was the most sensitive organism to PE and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was found to be 0.013 mg/mL where as the MIC of PE against V. cholerae was the highest (0.25 mg/mL). On the other hand PE showed growth promoting effect on the common probiotic bacterium L. acidophilus. The major finding was that S. grandiflora PE induced a significant biomass increase of L. acidophilus grown in liquid culture media. PE showed reduction of S. aureus growth in food (fish) during storage at 10 degrees C. High performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that rutin, a major flavonoid of the PE diminished in the culture medium MRS broth with the growth of L. acidophilus.
TI  - Growth properties and cholesterol removal ability of electroporated Lactobacillus acidophilus BT 1088.
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effects of electroporation on the cell growth, cholesterol removal, and adherence abilities of L. acidophilus BT 1088 and their subsequent passages. The growth of electroporated parent cells increased (P<0.05) by 4.49-21.25% compared with that of the control. This may be attributed to the alteration of cellular membrane. However, growth of first, second, and third passages of treated cells was comparable with that of the control, which may be attributed to the resealing of transient pores on the cellular membrane. Electroporation also increased (P<0.05) assimilation of cholesterol by treated parent cells (>185.40%) and first passage (>21.72%) compared with that of the control. Meanwhile, incorporation of cholesterol into the cellular membrane was also increased (P<0.05) in the treated parent cells (>108.33%) and first passage (>26.67%), accompanied by increased ratio of cholesterol:phospholipids (C:P) in these passages. Such increased ratio was also supported by increased enrichment of cholesterol in the hydrophilic heads, hydrophobic tails, and the interface regions of the membrane phospholipids of both parent and first passage cells compared with that of the control. However, such traits were not inherited by the subsequent second and third passages. Parent cells also showed decreased intestinal adherence ability (P<0.05; decreased by 1.45%) compared with that of the control, without inheritance by subsequent passages of treated cells. Our data suggest that electoporation could be a potential physical treatment to enhance the cholesterol removal ability of lactobacilli that was inherited by the first passage of treated cells without affecting their intestinal adherence ability.
TI  - Effect of probiotics on the treatment of children with atopic dermatitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis, a chronic recurrent disease, is frequently encountered in clinical practice. In the last 30 years, the prevalence of atopic dermatitis has rapidly increased due to industrialization. Therefore, there have been attempts in recent years to find new ways of treating and preventing atopic dermatitis. OBJECTIVE: In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, a combination of Bifidobacterium bifidum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus salivarius strains were evaluated in the treatment of atopic dermatitis in pediatric patients. METHODS: Forty pediatric patients (23 males and 17 females) aged 1~13 years were enrolled. One eligible individual who was approached declined to participate. The probiotic group was administered a probiotic complex containing B. bifidum, L. acidophilus, L. casei, and L. salivarius for 8 weeks. The placebo group, on the other hand, was administered skim milk powder and dextrose. All of the parameters including serum cytokines, eosinophil cationic protein), SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) index, and total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) were measured in both the probiotic group and the placebo group at the end of 8 weeks. RESULTS: Probiotic intervention in pediatric atopic dermatitis patients effectively reduced the SCORAD index and serum cytokines interleukin (IL)-5, IL-6, interferon (IFN)-gamma, and total serum IgE levels, but did not reduce levels of serum cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, ECP, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) compared to the placebo group. CONCLUSION: Our study found probiotics to be effective in reducing atopic dermatitis patients' SCORAD index, serum IL-5, IL-6, IFN-gamma, and total serum IgE levels but not effective in reducing serum IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, ECP, or TNF-alpha levels.
TI  - Development and quality of a Brazilian semi-hard goat cheese (coalho) with added  probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The effects of the addition of different strains of lactic acid bacteria on different quality parameters of a Brazilian goat semi-hard cheese (coalho) were assessed during 7 days of storage (10 degrees C) as follows: Control, Lactobacillus lactis subsp. lactis and L. lactis subsp. cremoris (standard); C2, L. acidophilus; C3, L. paracasei; C4, Bifidobacterium lactis; and C5, L. acidophilus, L. paracasei and B. lactis. There were no differences for the proteolysis index and depth of proteolysis among the assessed cheeses. The cheeses presented increase in hardness, gumminess and chewiness during the storage. Regarding the ability to melt, all evaluated cheeses showed a reduction in diameter. Cheeses presented high luminosity with predominance of the yellow component; and number of lactic bacteria greater than 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g during the 7 days of storage. C5 had better sensory scores in the acceptance test, purchase intention and preference ranking test. Coalho goat cheese could be a potential carrier of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Gut Balance, a synbiotic supplement, increases fecal Lactobacillus paracasei but  has little effect on immunity in healthy physically active individuals.
AB  - Synbiotic supplements, which contain multiple functional ingredients, may enhance the immune system more than the use of individual ingredients alone. A double blind active controlled parallel trial over a 21 d exercise training period was conducted to evaluate the effect of Gut Balance, which contains Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (L. casei 431(R)), Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis (BB-12(R)), Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA-5(R)), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LGG(R)), two prebiotics (raftiline and raftilose) and bovine whey derived lactoferrin and immunoglobulins with acacia gum on fecal microbiota, short chain fatty acids (SCFA), gut permeability, salivary lactoferrin and serum cytokines. All subjects randomized were included in the analysis. There was a 9-fold (1.2-fold to 64-fold; 95% confidence intervals p = 0.03) greater increase in fecal L. paracasei numbers with Gut Balance compared with acacia gum supplementation. Gut Balance was associated with a 50% (-12% to 72%; p = 0.02) smaller increase in the concentration of serum IL-16 in comparison to acacia gum from pre- to post-study. No substantial effects of either supplement were evident in fecal SCFA concentrations, measures of mucosal immunity or GI permeability. Clinical studies are now required to determine whether Gut Balance may exert beneficial GI health effects by increasing the recovery of fecal L. paracasei. Both supplements had little effect on immunity. Twenty two healthy physically active male subjects (mean age = 33.9 +/- 6.5y) were randomly allocated to either daily prebiotic or synbiotic supplementation for 21 d. Saliva, blood, urine and fecal samples were collected pre-, mid and post-intervention. Participants recorded patterns of physical activity on a self-reported questionnaire.
TI  - The effect of sourdough and calcium propionate on the microbial shelf-life of salt reduced bread.
AB  - The consumption of low-salt bread represents an efficient way to improve public health by decreasing cardiovascular health issues related to increased intakes of sodium chloride (NaCl). The reduction of NaCl influences the bread quality characteristics, in particular the shelf-life. Calcium propionate (CP) is commonly used in bread as an antifungal agent. Alternatively, sourdough can be used as a natural preservative. This work addresses the feasibility of NaCl reduction in wheat bread focussing on shelf-life and the compensation using sourdough as well as chemical preservatives. The impact of NaCl reduction and the addition of preservative agents in conjunction with different NaCl concentrations on the shelf-life of bread were tested under 'environmental' conditions in a bakery as well as using challenge tests against selected fungi. The challenge tests were performed using fungi commonly found in the bakery environment such as Penicillium expansum, Fusarium culmorum and Aspergillus niger. NaCl reduction decreased the shelf-life by 1-2 days. The addition of sourdough with antifungal activity prolonged the shelf-life to 12-14 days whereas the addition of 0.3 % calcium propionate prolonged the shelf-life to 10-12 days only. The fungal challenge tests revealed differences in the determined shelf-life between the different fungi based on their resistance. Similar antifungal performance was observed in sourdough breads and calcium propionate breads when tested against the different indicator moulds. The findings of this study indicate that addition of sourdough fermented using a specifically selected antifungal Lactobacillus amylovorus DSM 19280 can replace the chemical preservative calcium propionate addition and compensate for the reduced level and, therefore, guarantee the product safety of low-salt bread.
TI  - Influence of exposure time on gene expression by human intestinal epithelial cells exposed to Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Analysis of global temporal gene expression by human intestinal cells when exposed to Lactobacillus acidophilus revealed induction of immune-related pathways and NF-kappaB target genes after a 1-h exposure, compared to a 4- or 8-h exposure. Additionally, an L. acidophilus derivative expressing covalently bound flagellin resulted in increased induction of il8, cxc1, and cxcl2 compared to the parent L. acidophilus.
TI  - Diversity in growth and protein degradation by dairy relevant lactic acid bacteria species in reconstituted whey.
AB  - The high nutritional value of whey makes it an interesting substrate for the development of fermented foods. The aim of this work was to evaluate the growth and proteolytic activity of sixty-four strains of lactic acid bacteria in whey to further formulate a starter culture for the development of fermented whey-based beverages. Fermentations were performed at 37 degrees C for 24 h in 10 and 16% (w/v) reconstituted whey powder. Cultivable populations, pH, and proteolytic activity (o-phthaldialdehyde test) were determined at 6 and 24 h incubation. Hydrolysis of whey proteins was analysed by Tricine SDS-PAGE. A principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to evaluate the behaviour of strains. Forty-six percent of the strains grew between 1 and 2 Deltalog CFU/ml while 19% grew less than 0.9 Deltalog CFU/ml in both reconstituted whey solutions. Regarding the proteolytic activity, most of the lactobacilli released amino acids and small peptides during the first 6 h incubation while streptococci consumed the amino acids initially present in whey to sustain growth. Whey proteins were degraded by the studied strains although to different extents. Special attention was paid to the main allergenic whey protein, beta-lactoglobulin, which was degraded the most by Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 636 and Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CRL 656. The strain variability observed and the PCA applied in this study allowed selecting appropriate strains able to improve the nutritional characteristics (through amino group release and protein degradation) and storage (decrease in pH) of whey.
TI  - Double-blind, randomised clinical assay to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics in preterm newborns weighing less than 1500 g in the prevention of necrotising enterocolitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A randomised, double-blind clinical trial was undertaken in order to  assess the effectiveness of probiotics in the prevention of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) in newborns weighing <1500 g. METHODS: We studied a group of 150 patients who were randomised in two groups after parental consent was obtained, to receive either a daily feeding supplementation with a multispecies probiotic (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Bifidobacteruim infantis, Streptococcus thermophillus) 1 g per day plus their regular feedings or to receive their regular feedings with nothing added (control group), over the period of January 2007 through June 2010. Clinicians in care of the infants were blinded to the group assignment. RESULTS: The primary outcome was the development of NEC. Both groups were comparable, with no differences during hospitalisation, including the type of nutrition received. Blood cultures obtained from cases that developed sepsis did not reveal lactobacillus or Bifidobacteria growth. No differences were detected in terms of NEC risk reduction (RR: 0.54, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.39) although we did observe a clear trend in the reduction of NEC frequency in the studied cases: 6 (8%) versus 12 (16%) in the control group. When the combined risk of NEC or death was calculated as a post hoc analysis, we found a significantly lower risk (RR: 0.39, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.87) for the study group. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics may offer potential benefits for premature infants and are a promising strategy in the reduction of the risk of NEC in preterm newborns.
TI  - Discrimination of the Lactobacillus acidophilus group using sequencing, species-specific PCR and SNaPshot mini-sequencing technology based on the recA gene.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To clearly identify specific species and subspecies of the Lactobacillus acidophilus group using phenotypic and genotypic (16S rDNA sequence analysis) techniques alone is difficult. The aim of this study was to use the recA gene for species discrimination in the L. acidophilus group, as well as to develop a species-specific primer and single nucleotide polymorphism primer based on the recA gene sequence for species and subspecies identification. RESULTS: The average sequence similarity for the recA gene among type strains was 80.0%, and most members of the L. acidophilus group could be clearly distinguished. The species-specific primer was designed according to the recA gene sequencing, which was employed for polymerase chain reaction with the template DNA of Lactobacillus strains. A single 231-bp species-specific band was found only in L. delbrueckii. A SNaPshot mini-sequencing assay using recA as a target gene was also developed. The specificity of the mini-sequencing assay was evaluated using 31 strains of L. delbrueckii species and was able to unambiguously discriminate strains belonging to the subspecies L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. CONCLUSION: The phylogenetic relationships of most strains in the L. acidophilus group can be resolved using recA gene sequencing, and a novel method to identify the species and subspecies of the L. delbrueckii and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was developed by species-specific polymerase chain reaction combined with SNaPshot mini-sequencing.
TI  - A meta-analysis of probiotic efficacy for gastrointestinal diseases.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Meta-analyses on the effects of probiotics on specific gastrointestinal diseases have generally shown positive effects on disease prevention and treatment; however, the relative efficacy of probiotic use for treatment and prevention across different gastrointestinal diseases, with differing etiology and mechanisms of action, has not been addressed. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We included randomized controlled trials in humans that used a specified probiotic in the treatment or prevention of Pouchitis, Infectious diarrhea, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Helicobacter pylori, Clostridium difficile Disease, Antibiotic Associated Diarrhea, Traveler's Diarrhea, or Necrotizing Enterocolitis. Random effects models were used to evaluate efficacy as pooled relative risks across the eight diseases as well as across probiotic species, single vs. multiple species, patient ages, dosages, and length of treatment. Probiotics had a positive significant effect across all eight gastrointestinal diseases with a relative risk of 0.58 (95% (CI) 0.51-0.65). Six of the eight diseases: Pouchitis, Infectious diarrhea, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Helicobacter pylori, Clostridium difficile Disease, and Antibiotic Associated Diarrhea, showed positive significant effects. Traveler's Diarrhea and Necrotizing Enterocolitis did not show significant effects of probiotcs. Of the 11 species and species mixtures, all showed positive significant effects except for Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Bifidobacterium infantis. Across all diseases and probiotic species, positive significant effects of probiotics were observed for all age groups, single vs. multiple species, and treatment lengths. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Probiotics are generally beneficial in treatment and prevention of gastrointestinal diseases. Efficacy was not observed for Traveler's Diarrhea or Necrotizing Enterocolitis or for the probiotic species L. acidophilus, L. plantarum, and B. infantis. When choosing to use probiotics in the treatment or prevention of gastrointestinal disease, the type of disease and probiotic species (strain) are the most important factors to take into consideration.
TI  - Early administration of probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus and/or prebiotic inulin attenuates pathogen-mediated intestinal inflammation and Smad 7 cell signaling.
AB  - Immaturity of gut-associated immunity may contribute to pediatric mortality associated with enteric infections. A murine model to parallel infantile enteric disease was used to determine the effects of probiotic, Lactobacillus acidophilus (La), prebiotic, inulin, or both (synbiotic, syn) on pathogen-induced inflammatory responses, NF-kappaB, and Smad 7 signaling. Newborn mice were inoculated bi-weekly for 4 weeks with La, inulin, or syn and challenged with Citrobacter rodentium (Cr) at 5 weeks. Mouse intestinal epithelial cells (CMT93) were exposed to Cr to determine temporal alterations in NF-Kappa B and Smad 7 levels. Mice with pretreatment of La, inulin, and syn show reduced intestinal inflammation following Cr infection compared with controls, which is associated with significantly reduced bacterial colonization in La, inulin, and syn animals. Our results further show that host defense against Cr infection correlated with enhanced colonic IL-10 and transforming growth factor-beta expression and inhibition of NF-kappaB in syn-treated mice, whereas mice pretreated with syn, La, or inulin had attenuation of Cr-induced Smad 7 expression. There was a temporal Smad 7 and NF-kappaB intracellular accumulation post-Cr infection and post-tumor necrosis factor stimulation in CMT93 cells. These results, therefore, suggest that probiotic, La, prebiotic inulin, or synbiotic may promote host-protective immunity and attenuate Cr-induced intestinal inflammation through mechanisms affecting NF-kappaB and Smad 7 signaling.
TI  - Two-dimensional gel-based alkaline proteome of the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM (NCFM) is a well-documented probiotic bacterium isolated from human gut. Detailed 2D gel-based NCFM proteomics addressed the so-called alkaline range, i.e., pH 6-11. Proteins were identified in 150 of the 202 spots picked from the Coomassie Brilliant Blue stained 2D gel using MALDI-TOF-MS. The 102 unique gene products among the 150 protein identifications were assigned to different functional categories, and evaluated by considering a calculated distribution of abundance as well as grand average of hydrophobicity values. None of the very few available lactic acid bacteria proteome reference maps included the range of pI >7.0. The present report of such data on the proteome of NCFM fundamentally complements current knowledge on protein profiles limited to the acid and neutral pH range.
TI  - Probiotic suppression of the H. pylori-induced responses by conjugated linoleic acids in a gastric epithelial cell line.
AB  - Conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus was reported to decrease the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B. CLA was suggested as one of the anti-inflammatory molecular mechanisms of probiotics. In the present study, the effects of CLA on H. pylori-induced multiple responses were evaluated. IL-8, TNF-alpha and iNOS were measured in mRNA and/or protein levels in AGS cells after pretreatment with CLA or CLA-containing conditioned medium (CM) produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus or Lactobacillus plantarum. The increased expressions of IL-8 mRNA/protein and TNF-alpha mRNA were significantly suppressed by pretreatment with CM or CLA. The levels of IL-8 protein and TNF-alpha mRNA were suppressed by CM pretreatment better than CLA. The expression of iNOS mRNA was also significantly inhibited by CM pretreatment. These results suggest that the suppression of multiple mediators by CLA-containing CM plays a key role in the anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic effects of probiotics on H. pylori infection.
TI  - Anti-inflammatory activity of lactobacillus on carrageenan-induced paw edema in male wistar rats.
AB  - Introduction. Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus were used to assess the anti-inflammatory properties in carrageenan induced acute inflammatory model. Materials and Methods. Diclofenac sodium was used as standard drug at concentration of 150 mg/kg of body weight. Culture of Lactobacillus 2 x 10(7) CFU/ml was given orally. Edema was induced with 1% carrageenan to all the groups after one hour of the oral treatments. Paw thickness was checked at t = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 24 hours. Stair climbing score and motility score were assessed at t = 24 hours. Cytokines assay for IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-alpha was performed on serum samples. Results. Lactobacillus showed a statistically significant decrease in paw thickness at P < 0.001. L. acidophilus and L. casei decreased by 32% and 28% in paw thickness. They both significantly increased the stair climbing and motility score. Lactobacillus treatment significantly downregulated IL-6 and TNF-alpha while upregulated IL-10 at P < 0.0001. Conclusion. L. casei and L. acidophilus significantly decreased the inflammatory reactions induced by carrageenan. This study has also proposed that Lactobacillus ameliorated the inflammatory reaction by downregulating the proinflammatory cytokines pathway.
TI  - Exposure to probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus L-92 modulates gene expression profiles of epithelial Caco-2 cells.
AB  - To understand host gastrointestinal response after exposure to probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus L-92, microarray analysis of cultured epithelial Caco-2 cells was performed. Of the 187 genes down-regulated after 4 h treatment with L-92, 25 were involved in RNA splicing; 12, in cell cycle; 8 were transcriptional regulators; 2 were involved in ubiquitin proteolysis; 2, in adhesion; 2, in meiosis; 2, in splicing; and 2 encoding cytokines. In the RNA splicing group, genes encoding small nuclear RNAs, nuclear pore complex interacting proteins, RNA binding motif proteins, and SMG1 homologs (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase) were identified. Among the only 13 genes up-regulated by the treatment, 5 were involved in histone structure, and 2 were involved in metabolism. Genes belonging to cell adhesion, transmembrane proteins, mitogen-activated protein kinase, immune response, DNA binding, inflammation, and protein synthesis groups were mainly up-regulated after 20 h of treatment, whereas no significantly down-regulated genes were observed. In the present transcriptome analysis, during the early stage of treatment (four hours of treatment) with L-92, genes involved in cell growth and cell meiosis were mainly repressed. During the late phase of treatment (20 h of treatment), the expression of the genes linked to cell adhesion activity and metabolism for cell growth was enhanced. From the present transcriptome analysis, we suggest that Caco-2 cells slow down cell death and turnover of RNA synthesis as an early response to L-92 treatment; at the late stage of treatment, the genes involved in cell proliferation, transcriptional activity, and apoptosis are activated.
TI  - Efficacy of oral metronidazole with vaginal clindamycin or vaginal probiotic for  bacterial vaginosis: randomised placebo-controlled double-blind trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To determine if oral metronidazole (MTZ-400 mg bid) with 2% vaginal clindamycin-cream (Clind) or a Lactobacillus acidophilus vaginal-probiotic containing oestriol (Prob) reduces 6-month bacterial vaginosis (BV) recurrence. METHODS: Double-blind placebo-controlled parallel-group single-site study with balanced randomization (1:1:1) conducted at Melbourne Sexual Health Centre, Australia. Participants with symptomatic BV [Nugent Score (NS) = 7-10 or >/=3 Amsel's criteria and NS = 4-10], were randomly allocated to MTZ-Clind, MTZ-Prob or MTZ-Placebo and assessed at 1,2,3 and 6 months. MTZ and Clind were administered for 7 days and Prob and Placebo for 12 days. Primary outcome was BV recurrence (NS of 7-10) on self-collected vaginal-swabs over 6-months. Cumulative BV recurrence rates were compared between groups by Chi-squared statistics. Kaplan-Meier, log rank and Cox regression analyses were used to compare time until and risk of BV recurrence between groups. RESULTS: 450 18-50 year old females were randomized and 408 (91%), equally distributed between groups, provided >/=1 NS post-randomization and were included in analyses; 42 (9%) participants with no post-randomization data were excluded. Six-month retention rates were 78% (n = 351). One-month BV recurrence (NS 7-10) rates were 3.6% (5/140), 6.8% (9/133) and 9.6% (13/135) in the MTZ-Clind, MTZ-Prob and MTZ-Placebo groups respectively, p = 0.13. Hazard ratios (HR) for BV recurrence at one-month, adjusted for adherence to vaginal therapy, were 0.43 (95%CI 0.15-1.22) and 0.75 (95% CI 0.32-1.76) in the MTZ-Clind and MTZ-Prob groups compared to MTZ-Plac respectively. Cumulative 6-month BV recurrence was 28.2%; (95%CI 24.0-32.7%) with no difference between groups, p = 0.82; HRs for 6-month BV recurrence for MTZ-Clind and MTZ-Prob compared to MTZ-Plac, adjusted for adherence to vaginal therapy were 1.09(95% CI = 0.70-1.70) and 1.03(95% CI = 0.65-1.63), respectively. No serious adverse events occurred. CONCLUSION: Combining the recommended first line therapies of oral metronidazole and vaginal clindamycin, or oral metronidazole with an extended-course of a commercially available vaginal-L.acidophilus probiotic, does not reduce BV recurrence. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ANZCTR.org.au ACTRN12607000350426.
TI  - Randomized controlled trial of probiotics to reduce common cold in schoolchildren.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The common cold is responsible for the largest proportion of school and work absenteeism and causes a huge economic burden. None of the current interventions is greatly effective for prevention. Our aim was to assess the efficacy of a two-strain combination probiotic for prevention of common cold symptoms in healthy schoolchildren. METHODS: A double-blind randomized controlled trial was performed during the winter season in a public school of central Thailand. Children, aged 8-13 years, were randomized to receive either a two-strain combination probiotic (Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum) or placebo given twice a day for 3 months. The primary outcome was any symptom of cold during the 3-month study period while vomiting, diarrhea, use of antibiotics, school absence due to any cause, school absence due to cold and duration of all symptoms were secondary outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 40 children in each group, 31 (77%) in the probiotic group, compared to 38 (95%) in the placebo group (P= 0.048), developed at least one symptom of cold. Children in the probiotics group had significantly lower risk of fever, cough, rhinorrhea, school absence and school absence related to common cold compared to children in the placebo group. There was no impact on diarrhea and vomiting. CONCLUSION: A two-strain probiotic combination given twice a day for 3 months was able to reduce the symptoms of the common cold and school absenteeism in schoolchildren.
TI  - Fatty acid profile of pig meat after probiotic administration.
AB  - The aim of this work was to study the fatty acid profile of pig meat after probiotic administration. Thirty postweaned pigs (25 day old) were distributed into 2 groups: control (n = 15) and probiotic (n = 15). Each experimental group was fed ad libitum on a commercial diet for 35 days. Lactobacillus amylovorus and Enterococcus faecium mixed culture (10(8) CFU/ml)was daily orally delivered to the probiotic group. At the end of the assay, six pigs randomly selected from each group were slaughtered and muscle samples (Longissimus dorsi) were taken for fatty acid analysis. Tissues from the probiotic group animals exhibited an increase in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids; furthermore, linoleic acid (C18:2), linolenic acid (18:3), and cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) concentrations were significantly higher (p < 0.05) compared to the control group. These results suggest probiotic administration could be useful to modify and improve the fatty acid profile of pig meat.
TI  - Analysis of fumonisin B1 removal by microorganisms in co-occurrence with aflatoxin B1 and the nature of the binding process.
AB  - The objectives of this investigation were to evaluate the ability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae CECT 1891 and Lactobacillus acidophilus 24 to remove fumonisin B(1) (FB(1)) from liquid medium; to determine the nature of the mechanism involved in FB(1)-microorganism interaction and to analyze whether the presence of aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1)) interferes with the removal of FB(1) and vice versa. The results obtained indicated that: (i) both microorganisms were able to remove FB(1) from liquid medium; (ii) the removal was a fast and reversible process; (iii) cell viability was not necessary; (iv) the amount of FB(1) removed was both toxin- and microorganism concentration-dependent; (v) the process did not involve chemical modification of FB(1) molecules; and (vi) cell wall structural integrity of the microorganisms was required for FB(1) removal. Consequently, we propose that the mechanism involved in the removal of FB(1) is a physical adsorption (physisorption) of the toxin molecule to cell wall components of the microorganisms. It is highly probable that FB(1) and AFB(1) co-occur in contaminated foods, since the fungal genera Aspergillus and Fusarium frequently occur simultaneously. Therefore, we analyzed whether the presence of AFB(1) interferes with the removal of FB(1) by the microorganisms previously evaluated, and vice versa. Studies of co-occurrence of both mycotoxins clearly showed that they did not compete for binding sites on the microorganism cell wall and the presence of one toxin did not modify the efficiency of the organism in the removal of the other mycotoxin. These findings may be useful for optimization of mycotoxin binding and provide an important contribution to research on microorganisms with ability to remove these secondary metabolites.
TI  - Determination of wine microbiota using classical method, polymerase chain method  and Step One Real-Time PCR during fermentation process.
AB  - The aim of our study was the identification of grape, must and wine microbiota during the fermentation process using a classical microbiological method and Real-Time PCR. The changes in different groups of microorganisms were monitored in total counts of bacteria, lactobacilli and yeasts. Microbiological parameters were observed during the current collection and processing of grapes in 2009. Samples were taken during the fermentation process in wine enterprises and a private vineyard. During this period 30 samples of wine among Muller Thurgau, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Tramin and Red Bio-wine were examined. Samples were collected from stages of grape-must unfiltered, grape-must filtered, the beginning of fermentation, fermentation, late fermentation and young wine. The highest total counts of bacteria ranged from 0.00 to 176 +/- 15 CFU.mL(-1) in the wine of Muller Thurgau, the highest number of yeast ranged from 0.00 to 150 +/- 9 CFU.mL(-1) in the wine of Muller Thurgau and the number of Lactobacillus spp. ranged from 0.00 to 92 +/- 5 CFU.mL(-1) in the sample of Cabernet Sauvignon wine. The presence and sensitivity of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus salivarius were detected using Real-Time PCR (RTQ PCR). Susceptibility of Enterococcus faecium varied in different isolates from 1 to 10(6) CFU.mL(-1), the sensitivity of the species Lactobacillus acidophilus in different isolates of the wine samples ranged from 1 to 10(5) CFU.mL(-1). We also monitored representation of species Lactobacillus crispatus, which were captured by RTQ PCR sensitivity and ranged from 1 to 10(5) CFU.mL(-1). Identification of the species Lactobacillus salivarius in each of isolates by RTQ PCR method showed the presence of these bacteria in the range of 1 to 10(4) CFU.mL(-1).
TI  - Probiotic modulation of dendritic cells co-cultured with intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  - AIM: To investigate cytokine production and cell surface phenotypes of dendritic  cells (DC) in the presence of epithelial cells stimulated by probiotics. METHODS: Mouse DC were cultured alone or together with mouse epithelial cell monolayers in normal or inverted systems and were stimulated with heat-killed probiotic bacteria, Bifidobacterium lactis AD011 (BL), Bifidobacterium bifidum BGN4 (BB), Lactobacillus casei IBS041 (LC), and Lactobacillus acidophilus AD031 (LA), for 12 h. Cytokine levels in the culture supernatants were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and phenotypic analysis of DC was investigated by flow cytometry. RESULTS: BB and LC in single-cultured DC increased the expression of I-Ad, CD86 and CD40 (I-Ad, 18.51 vs 30.88, 46.11; CD86, 62.74 vs 92.7, 104.12; CD40, 0.67 vs 6.39, 3.37, P < 0.05). All of the experimental probiotics increased the production of inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. However, in the normal co-culture systems, LC and LA decreased the expression of I-A(d) (39.46 vs 30.32, 33.26, P < 0.05), and none of the experimental probiotics increased the levels of IL-6 or TNF-alpha. In the inverted co-culture systems, LC decreased the expression of CD40 (1.36 vs -2.27, P < 0.05), and all of the experimental probiotics decreased the levels of IL-6. In addition, BL increased the production of IL-10 (103.8 vs 166.0, P < 0.05) and LC and LA increased transforming growth factor-beta secretion (235.9 vs 618.9, 607.6, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that specific probiotic strains exert differential immune modulation mediated by the interaction of dendritic cells and epithelial cells in the homeostasis of gastrointestinal tract.
TI  - Fluid bed porosity mathematical model for an inverse fluidized bed bioreactor with particles growing biofilm.
AB  - A new mathematic model to estimate bed porosity as a function of Reynolds and Archimedes numbers was developed based in experimental data. Experiments were performed using an inverse fluidized bed bioreactor filled with polypropylene particles, Lactobacillus acidophillus as the immobilized strain and fluidized with a Man-Rogosa-Sharpe culture medium under controlled temperature and pH conditions. Bed porosity was measured at different flow rates, starting from 0.95 to 9.5 LPM. The new model has several advantages when compared with previously reported. Among them, advantages such as standard deviation values </= 1% between experimental and calculated bed porosity, its applicability in traditional and inverse fluidization, wall effects do not take account, it gives excellent agreement with spherical particles with or without biofilm, and inertial drag coefficient allow extend the new model a non-spherical particles.
TI  - Transfer of antibiotic resistance determinants between lactobacilli isolates from the gastrointestinal tract of chicken.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the potential horizontal transfer of genetic  traits for antibiotic resistance between lactobacilli isolated from the chicken gut, both in vitro and in vivo. Thirty-seven Lactobacillus spp. strains isolated from the gizzard, small and large intestines and caeca of free-range broiler chickens showed multi-drug resistance as assessed by disc diffusion assays. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for vancomycin, tetracycline, erythromycin and chloramphenicol was determined in De Man, Rogosa and Sharpe broth in a microplate assay. Almost all the lactobacilli isolates were resistant to vancomycin (except strains belonging to the Lactobacillus acidophilus group) and to tetracycline (MIC>/=128 mug/ml). Only five strains were resistant to erythromycin, and six to chloramphenicol. The transfer rate in filter mating experiments performed using L. acidophilus strain 4M14E (EmR), Lactobacillus vaginalis strain 5M14E (CmR), Lactobacillus salivarius strain 5C14C (EmR), and the 4G14L and 3C14C strains of Lactobacillus reuteri (CmR) showed a frequency of approximately 1x104 cfu/ml of double-resistant transconjugants for the different combinations. The exception was the L. salivarius 5C14C (EmR) and L. vaginalis 5M14E (CmR) mating combination, which produced no transconjugants. In vivo experiments performed in gnotobiotic mice by mating L. acidophilus 4M14E (EmR) with L. reuteri 3C14C (CmR), L. reuteri 4G14L (CmR) or L. vaginalis 5M14E (CmR) resulted in transconjugants at 3.95+/-0.29, 3.16+/-0.33, and 4.55+/-1.52 log10 cfu/g of faeces, respectively. Taken together, these data suggest that genetic exchange may occur between native bacterial strains within the gastrointestinal tract of chickens, which might maintain a dynamic gene pool conferring antibiotic resistance upon indigenous microbiota components, even in the absence of the pathogens. This possibility must be taken into account as a complementary criterion when lactobacilli are screened for probiotic use.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus strain L-92 induces CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T  cells and suppresses allergic contact dermatitis.
AB  - The anti-allergic mechanism of heat-killed Lactobacillus acidophilus strain L-92  has not been fully investigated. Recent studies have reported that CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) (forkhead box P3) T regulatory (Treg) cells play important roles in controlling allergic diseases. Hence, we examined the effect of orally administered L-92 on CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) cell populations. BALB/c mice were supplemented daily with L-92 by gavage for 5 weeks. 2,4-Dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) was used to induce allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) in mice. Fluorescent-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis was used to determine CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) T cell populations in spleen and cervical lymph nodes (CLN). Interleukin-10 (IL-10), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), and Foxp3 mRNA expressions in mouse ear skin were investigated by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The percentage of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) T cell populations were significantly increased in both spleen and CLN of L-92-fed group than vehicle and control. In addition, L-92 produced higher levels of Foxp3, IL-10 and TGF-beta compared to control mice. These results suggest that L-92 can up-regulate the number of Treg cells to suppress the progression of DNFB-induced contact dermatitis in mice.
TI  - The effect of using prebiotic and probiotic products on intestinal micro-flora of the honeybee (Apis mellifera carpatica).
AB  - Maintaining bee colonies in a healthy state throughout the year is one of the main concerns of apiculture researchers. The phenomenon of disappearance of bee colonies is determined by several factors, one of which is bee disease. Due to the organizational structure of the bee colony, disease transmission is rapid, especially through infected food or via the nurse worker bees that feed the brood bees of the colony concerned. The practice of stimulating the bee colonies in spring using sugar syrup feeds with added prebiotic products (lactic acid or acetic acid) and probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-14 and Bifidobacterium lactis BI-04) by using an Enterobiotic product (Lactobacillus casei), marketed as Enterolactis Plus, for three weeks, resulted in a significant reduction of the total number of bacteria in the digestive tracts of the bees, compared with the control group. By contrast, intestinal colonization with beneficial bacteria contained in probiotics products administered to the bees was observed. This resulted in an improved health status and bio productive index of the bee colonies studied.
TI  - Effectiveness of the Novel Herbal Medicine, KIOM-MA, and Its Bioconversion Product, KIOM-MA128, on the Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis.
AB  - This study was conducted to determine if oral administration of the novel herbal  medicine, KIOM-MA, and its Lactobacillus acidophilus-fermented product, KIOM-MA128, has therapeutic properties for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). Using AD-induced BALB/c mice by Ovalbumin and aluminum hydroxide, the effectiveness of KIOM-MA and KIOM-MA128 on AD was evaluated. Oral administration of KIOM-MA and KIOM-MA128 reduced major clinical signs of AD including erythema/darkening, edema/papulation, excoriations, lichenification/prurigo, and dryness. Interestingly, KIOM-MA128 more significantly improved AD-related symptoms including decrease of IgE level in the plasma as well as reduction of scratching behavior, skin severity in the AD BALB/c model. HPLC analysis showed the significant changes in the constituent patterns between KIOM-MA and KIOM-MA128. Our results suggest that both KIOM-MA and KIOM-MA128 have potential for therapeutic reagent for the treatment of AD, and further, the efficacy is significantly enhanced by L. acidophilus fermentation via increases in its indicator molecule.
TI  - Effects of probiotics and antibiotics on the intestinal homeostasis in a computer controlled model of the large intestine.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic associated diarrhea and Clostridium difficile infection are frequent complications of broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. Probiotic bacteria are used as therapeutic and preventive agents in these disorders, but the exact functional mechanisms and the mode of action are poorly understood. The effects of clindamycin and the probiotic mixture VSL#3 (containing the 8 bacterial strains Streptococcus thermophilus, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. Bulgaricus) consecutively or in combination were investigated and compared to controls without therapy using a standardized human fecal microbiota in a computer-controlled in vitro model of large intestine. Microbial metabolites (short chain fatty acids, lactate, branched chain fatty acids, and ammonia) and the intestinal microbiota were analyzed. RESULTS: Compared to controls and combination therapy, short chain fatty acids and lactate, but also ammonia and branched chain fatty acids, were increased under probiotic therapy. The metabolic pattern under combined therapy with antibiotics and probiotics had the most beneficial and consistent effect on intestinal metabolic profiles. The intestinal microbiota showed a decrease in several indigenous bacterial groups under antibiotic therapy, there was no significant recovery of these groups when the antibiotic therapy was followed by administration of probiotics. Simultaneous application of anti- and probiotics had a stabilizing effect on the intestinal microbiota with increased bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of VSL#3 parallel with the clindamycin therapy had a beneficial and stabilizing effect on the intestinal metabolic homeostasis by decreasing toxic metabolites and protecting the endogenic microbiota from destruction. Probiotics could be a reasonable strategy in prevention of antibiotic associated disturbances of the intestinal homeostasis and disorders.
TI  - Probiotics in milk replacer influence lamb immune function and meat quality.
AB  - This study was undertaken to assess the effect of milk replacer (MR) containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and a mix of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis and Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum on lamb immune response and on lamb meat quality. A 6-week-trial was conducted on 40 male Comisana lambs, divided into four groups, fed maternal milk (MM), MR, MR with L. acidophilus supplementation (MRL) and MR with a mix (1 : 1) of B. animalis subsp. lactis and B. longum subsp. longum supplementations (MRB). Lambs fed MR containing a mix of bifidobacteria showed the highest in vivo cellular immune response to phytohemagglutinin, whereas MM and MRB showed the highest antibody response to ovalbumin. At day 11 of the trial, MRL displayed the highest value of Interleukin-10; differences disappeared among groups subsequently. Blood cholesterol levels in lambs fed MR containing L. acidophilus was almost halved compared with that found in MM and MR groups. Meat from artificially reared lambs was characterized by trans-11 18:1 and total conjugated 18:2n-6, whereas meat from the dam-suckled lambs was characterized by 14:0, cis-9 14:1 and 16:0. Polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratio was higher in meat of MR, MRL and MRB than in MM lambs. Meat from artificially reared lamb fed MR containing probiotics showed an improved fatty acid profile for human diet.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus ameliorates H. pylori-induced gastric inflammation by inactivating the Smad7 and NFkappaB pathways.
AB  - BACKGROUND: H. pylori infection may trigger Smad7 and NFkappaB expression in the  stomach, whereas probiotics promote gastrointestinal health and improve intestinal inflammation caused by pathogens. This study examines if probiotics can improve H. pylori-induced gastric inflammation by inactivating the Smad7 and NFkappaB pathways. RESULTS: Challenge with H. pylori increased IL-8 and TNF-alpha expressions but not TGF-beta1 in MKN45 cells. The RNA levels of Smad7 in AGS cells increased after H. pylori infection in a dose-dependent manner. A higher dose (MOI 100) of L. acidophilus pre-treatment attenuated the H. pylori-induced IL-8 expressions, but not TGF-beta1. Such anti-inflammatory effect was mediated via increased cytoplasmic IkappaBalpha and depletion of nuclear NFkappaB. L. acidophilus also inhibited H. pylori-induced Smad7 transcription by inactivating the Jak1 and Stat1 pathways, which might activate the TGF-beta1/Smad pathway. L. acidophilus pre-treatment ameliorated IFN-gamma-induced Smad7 translation level and subsequently reduced nuclear NF-kappaB production, as detected by western blotting. CONCLUSIONS: H. pylori infection induces Smad7, NFkappaB, IL-8, and TNF-alpha production in vitro. Higher doses of L. acidophilus pre-treatment reduce H. pylori-induced inflammation through the inactivation of the Smad7 and NFkappaB pathways.
TI  - Elevated IgG levels against specific bacterial antigens in obese patients with diabetes and in mice with diet-induced obesity and glucose intolerance.
AB  - High fat diets increase the risk for insulin resistance by promoting inflammation. The cause of inflammation is unclear, but germfree mouse studies have implicated commensal gut bacteria. We tested whether diet-induced obesity, diabetes, and inflammation are associated with anti-bacterial IgG. Blood from lean and obese healthy volunteers or obese patients with diabetes were analyzed by ELISA for IgG against extracts of potentially pathogenic and pro-biotic strains of Escherichia coli (LF-82 and Nissle), Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and Lactobacillus acidophilus, and for circulating tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). C57Bl/6 mice were fed low- or high-fat diets (10% or 60% kcal from fat) for 10 weeks and tested for anti-bacterial IgG, bodyweight, fasting glucose, and inflammation. Obese diabetic patients had significantly more IgG against extracts of E. coli LF-82 compared with lean controls, whereas IgG against extracts of the other bacteria was unchanged. Circulating TNFalpha was elevated and correlated with IgG against the LF-82 extract. Mice fed high-fat diets had increased fasting glucose levels, elevated TNFalpha and neutrophils, and significantly more IgG against the LF-82 extracts. Diabetes in obesity is characterized by increased IgG against specific bacterial antigens. Specific commensal bacteria may mediate inflammatory effects of high-fat diets.
TI  - Induction of intestinal pro-inflammatory immune responses by lipoteichoic acid.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The cellular and molecular mechanisms of inflammatory bowel disease are not fully understood; however, data indicate that uncontrolled chronic inflammation induced by bacterial gene products, including lipoteichoic acid (LTA), may trigger colonic inflammation resulting in disease pathogenesis. LTA is a constituent glycolipid of Gram-positive bacteria that shares many inflammatory properties with lipopolysaccharide and plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of severe inflammatory responses via Toll-like receptor 2. Accordingly, we elucidate the role of LTA in immune stimulation and induced colitis in vivo. METHODS: To better understand the molecular mechanisms utilized by the intestinal microbiota and their gene products to induce or subvert inflammation, specifically the effect(s) of altered surface layer protein expression on the LTA-mediated pro-inflammatory response, the Lactobacillus acidophilus surface layer protein (Slp) genes encoding SlpB and SlpX were deleted resulting in a SlpB- and SlpX- mutant that continued to express SlpA (assigned as NCK2031). RESULTS: Our data show profound activation of dendritic cells by NCK2031, wild-type L. acidophilus (NCK56), and purified Staphylococcus aureus-LTA. In contrary to the LTA-deficient strain NCK2025, the LTA-expressing strains NCK2031 and NCK56, as well as S. aureus-LTA, induce pro-inflammatory innate and T cell immune responses in vivo. Additionally, neither NCK2031 nor S. aureus-LTA supplemented in drinking water protected mice from DSS-colitis, but instead, induced significant intestinal inflammation resulting in severe colitis and tissue destruction. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that directed alteration of two of the L. acidophilus NCFM-Slps did not ameliorate LTA-induced pro-inflammatory signals and subsequent colitis.
TI  - Increases in GroES and GroEL from Lactobacillus acidophilus L-92 in response to a decrease in medium pH, and changes in cytokine release from splenocytes: Transcriptome and proteome analyses.
AB  - To study the anti-allergy effects of probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus L-92 (L-92), changes in the immunomodulatory effect and key cell components in response to media pH in which L-92 cells were cultivated were studied using microarray and proteome analyses. Growth of L-92 cells was restricted if the medium pH was uncontrolled and the release of IL-12 from splenocytes increased as the pH decreased during cell growth. The decrease in pH from 5.0 to 4.5 at the exponential phase of growth had the greatest effect on the release of IL-12. When L-92 cells were cultured at low pH, the release of IL-12, IFN-gamma and IL-10 was increased but IL-4 release was decreased from splenocytes. Comparative transcriptome analysis between L-92 cells cultured at pH 5.0 and pH 4.5 in MRS medium revealed significant up-regulation of 121 genes and down-regulation of 92 genes. Among the significantly changed genes, heat shock proteins such as GroES and GroEL were considered to be the most likely components affecting immunomodulation. Proteome analysis of the cell wall-associated components of L-92 also supported increases in GroES and GroEL as cell surface components in L-92 cells cultured at a lower pH. In conclusion, increases in cell wall-associated components of L-92, such as GroES and GroEL, in response to a pH decrease affect the release of certain cytokines from splenocytes.
TI  - Determination of lactic microflora of kefir grains and kefir beverage by using culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  - In this study, we investigated the bacterial compositions of kefir grains and kefir beverages collected from different regions of Turkey by using culture-independent and culture-dependent methods. In the culture-independent detection, 10 different species of bacteria were detected in total by using the polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analysis of the 16S rRNA gene V3 region. Among these species, Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens was the most dominant one in the kefir grains, while Lactococcus lactis was found to be significantly prevalent in the kefir beverages. In the culture-dependent detection, the primary differentiation and grouping of the isolates from kefir beverages and kefir grains were performed using repetitive sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) fingerprinting, and the results were validated by 16S rDNA full-length sequencing. According to the results of culture-dependent methods, the most frequently isolated species were L. lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Lactobacillus kefiri, respectively. Only 3 species, which are L. lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Streptococcus thermophilus, were detected with both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. This study showed that the combination of both methods is necessary for a detailed and reliable investigation of microbial communities in kefir grains and kefir beverages. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Due to their artisan- and region-dependent microflora, kefir products can be a source of interesting lactic acid bacteria, either new taxa or strains with specific functional properties, which might be used for the development of new starter cultures and innovative food products. Therefore, an increasing demand exists for new strains that show desirable effects on the product characteristics Artisan dairy products are a candidate source of such microorganisms. For this reason, in this study, the bacterial compositions of kefir grains and kefir beverages obtained from different regions of Turkey were studied using culture-dependent and culture-independent molecular methods.
TI  - [A study on human tongue cancer cells' proliferation affected by Lactobacillus acidophilus].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) on  the proliferation and cell cycle distribution of human tongue cancer cells (Tca8113 cells). METHODS: In vitro cultivated human Tca8113 cells were treated by L. acidophilus supernatant, inactivated bacilli, cell free extracts and normal culture medium respectively, which were 1, 4, 16-fold(s) dilutelly, to investigate the proliferous effects of Tca8113 cells using of inverted microscope, cell counting, sulforhodamine B (SRB) and flow cytometry. The free radicals and Ca2+ in Tca8113 cells were also studied by confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM). RESULTS: At the 48th hour after adding different L. acidophilus components, the Tca8113 cells changed in shape from the diamond-like, polygonal and slabs into the elongated form. In the condition of different times and different culture concentrations, the proliferation of Tca8113 cells was significantly inhibited by L. acidophilus components, which enhanced as the time prolonged and the concentrations of each L. acidophilus components increased according to the cell counting and the SRB experimental analysis. The cell proliferation index (CPI) was significantly reduced (P<0.01). The free radicals and Ca2+ in Tca8113 cells under the effect of each L. acidophilus components for 48 h indicated an obviously rising (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: L. acidophilus restrains the proliferation of Tca8113 cells, which might be due to the increase in quantity of free radicals and Ca2+ in Tca8113 cells, and might be resulted from the release of metabolic products of L. acidophilus.
TI  - Sublingual administration of Lactobacillus paracasei KW3110 inhibits Th2-dependent allergic responses via upregulation of PD-L2 on dendritic cells.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria have potential in immunomodulation therapy, but their clinical efficacy and underlying mechanisms are unclear. We aimed to clarify the anti-allergic immune responses induced by intragastric and sublingual administration of heat-killed Lactobacillus paracasei KW3110 and Lactobacillus acidophilus L-92. The KW3110 strain (but not the L-92 strain) enhanced ovalbumin (OVA)-induced expression of CCR-7 and PD-L2 in murine dendritic cells (DCs), and strongly inhibited IL-5 and IL-13 production in vitro in co-cultures with Th2-skewed CD4(+) T cells from DO11.10 transgenic mice. Sublingual administration of low-dose KW3110 (but not L-92) to OVA-sensitized mice selectively suppressed serum IgE production and Th2 cytokine expression in cervical lymph nodes, and significantly improved symptoms after OVA provocation in vivo. KW3110 probably accelerates DC migration into the regional lymph nodes and inhibits Th2 cytokine production through enhanced CCR-7 and PD-L2 expression. Thus, sublingual KW3110 administration may be effective in reducing allergic inflammation.
TI  - Effect of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Lactobacillus acidophilus on secretion of  IL1B, IL6, and IL8 by gingival epithelial cells.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis alters cytokine expression in gingival epithelial cells, stimulating inflammatory responses that may lead to periodontal disease. This study explored the effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus on the specific expressions of the interleukins (ILs) IL1B, IL6, and IL8 induced by the pathogen. Human gingival epithelial cells were co-cultured with P. gingivalis, L. acidophilus, or L. acidophilus + P. gingivalis; the control group consisted of the cells alone. Protein and gene expression levels of the ILs were detected using ELISA and qRT-PCR, respectively. The supernatant from the P. gingivalis group held significantly higher protein and mRNA levels of IL1B, IL6, and IL8, compared to the control group. In the mixed bacterial group (L. acidophilus + P. gingivalis), the levels of all three ILs decreased with increasing concentrations of L. acidophilus and were significantly different from the P. gingivalis group. This suggests that in gingival cells, L. acidophilus offsets the P. gingivalis-induced secretion of these ILs in a dose-dependent manner.
TI  - Minimum taxonomic criteria for bacterial genome sequence depositions and announcements.
AB  - Multiple bioinformatic methods are available to analyse the information encoded within the complete genome sequence of a bacterium and accurately assign its species status or nearest phylogenetic neighbour. However, it is clear that even now in what is the third decade of bacterial genomics, taxonomically incorrect genome sequence depositions are still being made. We outline a simple scheme of bioinformatic analysis and a set of minimum criteria that should be applied to all bacterial genomic data to ensure that they are accurately assigned to the species or genus level prior to database deposition. To illustrate the utility of the bioinformatic workflow, we analysed the recently deposited genome sequence of Lactobacillus acidophilus 30SC and demonstrated that this DNA was in fact derived from a strain of Lactobacillus amylovorus. Using these methods researchers can ensure that the taxonomic accuracy of genome sequence depositions is maintained within the ever increasing nucleic acid datasets.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus induces cytokine and chemokine production via NF-kappaB and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways in intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  - Intestinal epithelial cells can respond to certain bacteria by producing an array of cytokines and chemokines which are associated with host immune responses. Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM is a characterized probiotic, originally isolated from human feces. This study aimed to test the ability of L. acidophilus NCFM to stimulate cytokine and chemokine production in intestinal epithelial cells and to elucidate the mechanisms involved in their upregulation. In experiments using intestinal epithelial cell lines and mouse models, we observed that L. acidophilus NCFM could rapidly but transiently upregulate a number of effector genes encoding cytokines and chemokines such as interleukin 1alpha (IL-1alpha), IL-1beta, CCL2, and CCL20 and that cytokines showed lower expression levels with L. acidophilus NCFM treatment than chemokines. Moreover, L. acidophilus NCFM could activate a pathogen-associated molecular pattern receptor, Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), in intestinal epithelial cell lines. The phosphorylation of NF-kappaB p65 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in intestinal epithelial cell lines was also enhanced by L. acidophilus NCFM. Furthermore, inhibitors of NF-kappaB (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate [PDTC]) and p38 MAPK (SB203580) significantly reduced cytokine and chemokine production in the intestinal epithelial cell lines stimulated by L. acidophilus NCFM, suggesting that both NF-kappaB and p38 MAPK signaling pathways were important for the production of cytokines and chemokines induced by L. acidophilus NCFM.
TI  - Effect of the consumption of a new symbiotic shake on glycemia and cholesterol levels in elderly people with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The consumption of foods containing probiotic and prebiotic ingredients is growing consistently every year, and in view of the limited number of studies investigating their effect in the elderly. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the consumption of a symbiotic shake containing Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium bifidum and fructooligosaccharides on glycemia and cholesterol levels in elderly people. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted on twenty volunteers (ten for placebo group and ten for symbiotic group), aged 50 to 60 years. The criteria for inclusion in the study were: total cholesterol > 200 mg/dL; triglycerides > 200 mg/dL and glycemia > 110 mg/dL. Over a total test period of 30 days, 10 individuals (the symbiotic group) consumed a daily dose of 200 mL of a symbiotic shake containing 10(8) UFC/mL Lactobacillus acidophilus, 10(8) UFC/mL Bifidobacterium bifidum and 2 g oligofructose, while 10 other volunteers (the placebo group) drank daily the same amount of a shake that did not contain any symbiotic bacteria. Blood samples were collected 15 days prior to the start of the experiment and at 10-day intervals after the beginning of the shake intake. The standard lipid profile (total cholesterol, triglycerides and HDL cholesterol) and glycemia, or blood sugar levels, were evaluated by an enzyme colorimetric assay. RESULTS: The results of the symbiotic group showed a non-significant reduction (P > 0.05) in total cholesterol and triglycerides, a significant increase (P < 0.05) in HDL cholesterol and a significant reduction (P < 0.05) in fasting glycemia. No significant changes were observed in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: The consumption of symbiotic shake resulted in a significant increase in HDL and a significant decrease of glycemia. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00123456.
TI  - Dual functionality of triticale as a novel dietary source of prebiotics with antioxidant activity in fermented dairy products.
AB  - The objectives of this study were to: (i) define the optimum concentration of triticale bran (TB) that can be incorporated in yogurt, (ii) evaluate the prebiotic effects of TB on microbial viability, pH and total titratable acidity (TTA) in yogurt across 28 days of cold storage, and (iii) measure the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) of water-extractable polysaccharides (WEP) in TB. Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus were used as starter cultures. Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis were used as probiotics. A concentration of 4% TB in yogurt was determined to be the maximum amount that could be added without causing synersis. By day 7, the number of bacteria greatly increased in yogurt samples containing TB and maintained higher viable bacteria counts at the end of the cold storage period, in comparison to controls (P </= 0.05). Confirming this data was the lower pH levels and higher TTA values of TB yogurt samples exhibited throughout 28 days (P </= 0.05). Polysaccharide extracts of TB exhibited strong antioxidant activity with an ORAC value of 33.86 +/- 2.30 mumol trolox equivalents (TE)/g of bran. Results of this study suggest that TB may serve as a new prebiotic and antioxidant source for functional foods and nutraceutical applications.
TI  - Effect of water activity and protective solutes on growth and subsequent survival to air-drying of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium cultures.
AB  - Probiotic cultures of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus were grown in media having water activities (a (w)) adjusted between 0.99 and 0.94 with NaCl or with a mixture of glycerol and sucrose in order to find conditions of osmotic stress which would still allow for good growth. Cultures grown at a (w) = 0.96 or 0.99 were then recovered by centrifugation, added to a sucrose-phosphate medium and air-dried. In some assays, a 2-h osmotic stress was applied to the cell concentrate prior to air-drying. Assays were also carried out where betaine, glutamate and proline (BGP) supplements were added as protective compounds to the growth or drying media. For most strains, evidence of osmotic stress and benefits of BGP supplementation on growth occurred at a (w) = 0.96. Growing the cells in complex media adjusted at a (w) = 0.96 did not enhance their subsequent survival to air-drying, but applying the 2-h osmotic stress did. Addition of the BGP supplements to the growth medium or in the 2-h stress medium did not enhance survival to air-drying. Furthermore, addition of BGP to a sucrose-phosphate drying medium reduced survival of the cultures to air-drying. This study provides preliminary data for producers of probiotics who wish to use air-drying in replacement of freeze-drying for the stabilization of cultures.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus reuteri modulate cytokine responses in gnotobiotic pigs infected with human rotavirus.
AB  - Probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been shown to alleviate inflammation, enhance the immunogenicity of rotavirus vaccines, or reduce the severity of rotavirus diarrhoea. Although the mechanisms are not clear, the differential Th1/Th2/Th3-driving capacities and modulating effects on cytokine production of different LAB strains may be the key. Our goal was to delineate the influence of combining two probiotic strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus reuteri on the development of cytokine responses in neonatal gnotobiotic pigs infected with human rotavirus (HRV). We demonstrated that HRV alone, or HRV plus LAB, but not LAB alone, initiated serum cytokine responses, as indicated by significantly higher concentrations of IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-12, and IL-10 at postinoculation day (PID) 2 in the HRV only and LAB+HRV+ pigs compared to LAB only and LAB-HRV- pigs. Peak cytokine responses coincided with the peak of HRV replication. LAB further enhanced the Th1 and Th2 cytokine responses to HRV infection as indicated by significantly higher concentrations of IL-12, IFN-gamma, IL-4 and IL-10 in the LAB+HRV+ pigs compared to the LAB-HRV+ pigs. The LAB+HRV+ pigs maintained relatively constant concentrations of TGF-beta compared to the HRV only group which had a significant increase at PID 2 and decrease at PID 7, suggesting a regulatory role of LAB in maintaining gut homeostasis. At PID 28, cytokine secreting cell (CSC) responses, measured by ELISpot, showed increased Th1 (IL-12, IFN-gamma) CSC numbers in the LAB+HRV+ and LAB-HRV+ groups compared to LAB only and LAB-HRV- pigs, with significantly increased IL-12 CSCs in spleen and PBMCs and IFN-gamma CSCs in spleen of the LAB+HRV+ group. Thus, HRV infection alone, but not LAB alone was effective in inducing cytokine responses but LAB significantly enhanced both Th1 and Th2 cytokines in HRV-infected pigs. LAB may also help to maintain immunological homeostasis during HRV infection by regulating TGF-beta production.
TI  - Genes involved in lactose catabolism and organic acid production during growth of Lactobacillus delbrueckii UFV H2b20 in skimmed milk.
AB  - There are three main reasons for using lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as starter cultures in industrial food fermentation processes: food preservation due to lactic acid production; flavour formation due to a range of organic molecules derived from sugar, lipid and protein catabolism; and probiotic properties attributed to some strains of LAB, mainly of lactobacilli. The aim of this study was to identify some genes involved in lactose metabolism of the probiotic Lactobacillus delbrueckii UFV H2b20, and analyse its organic acid production during growth in skimmed milk. The following genes were identified, encoding the respective enzymes: ldh - lactate dehydrogenase, adhE - Ldb1707 acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, and ccpA-pepR1 - catabolite control protein A. It was observed that L. delbrueckii UFV H2b20 cultivated in different media has the unexpected ability to catabolyse galactose, and to produce high amounts of succinic acid, which was absent in the beginning, raising doubts about the subspecies in question. The phylogenetic analyses showed that this strain can be compared physiologically to L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, which are able to degrade lactose and can grow in milk. L. delbrueckii UFV H2b20 sequences have grouped with L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus ATCC 11842 and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus ATCC BAA-365, strengthening the classification of this probiotic strain in the NCFM group proposed by a previous study. Additionally, L. delbrueckii UFV H2b20 presented an evolutionary pattern closer to that of probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM, corroborating the suggestion that this strain might be considered as a new and unusual subspecies among L. delbrueckii subspecies, the first one identified as a probiotic. In addition, its unusual ability to metabolise galactose, which was significantly consumed in the fermentation medium, might be exploited to produce low-browning probiotic Mozzarella cheeses, a desirable property for pizza cheeses.
TI  - The influence of probiotic treatment on sulfasalazine metabolism in rat.
AB  - Probiotics are live microorganisms claimed to exert beneficial effects on the host. This study investigated their effect on the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of sulfasalazine (SSZ), a drug whose efficacy depends on metabolism by azoreductase (AR) in the gut microbiota to sulfapyridine (SP) and 5-acetylsalicylic acid (5-ASA). The probiotic strains Lactobacillus acidophilus L10, Bifidobacterium lactis B94 and Streptococcus salivarius K12 possessed AR activity and a corresponding ability to metabolize SSZ. Treatment of male Wistar rats (n = 5) with oral 2 g doses of a mixture of the three probiotics (total dose 1.8 x 10(9) cfu) every 12 h for 3 days resulted in a significant increase (p < 0.05) in AR activity in ex vivo colon contents with a corresponding increase in SSZ metabolism. Similar probiotic treatment of male Wistar rats (n = 8) followed by an oral 100 mg/kg dose of SSZ produced high plasma levels of SP, but pharmacokinetic parameters of SSZ and SP were not significantly different from control rats given SSZ. These results indicate that probiotic strains possess AR activity and can metabolize SSZ. Treatment with probiotics increases AR activity in the gut microbiota but has no effect on plasma levels of SSZ and SP following a subsequent oral dose of SSZ.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of different Lactobacillus species against multi- drug resistant clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactobacilli are the well known friendly bacteria for their probiotic activities against pathogens. The inhibitory activity of different strains of lactobacilli either obtained as commercial products or isolated from human feces was investigated against the clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The isolates were selected as the most resistant strains when challenged with anti-pseudomonal antibiotics already in clinical practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Both the plate spot test as well as the agar cup method were used for screening of Lactobacillus strains against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. RESULTS: A Lactobacillus acidophilus strain isolated from feces of an Iranian child showed a strong anti-pseudomonal activity (90 percent after 72h incubation) against the multi-drug resistant clinical isolates while a Lactobacillus reuteri strain isolated from a commercial oral product resulted in relatively weak response and a Lactobacillus acidophilus strain isolated from a commercial vaginal product did not show any inhibitory activity. In a kinetic study the lactobacillus sensitive Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed a significant bacteriostatic activity in vitro in the presence of lactobacillus supernatants. CONCLUSION: Some lactobacilli exhibit significant inhibitory activity against the multidrug resistant clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Strain dependent protection conferred by Lactobacillus spp. administered orally with a Salmonella Typhimurium vaccine in a murine challenge model.
AB  - Consumption of Lactobacillus spp. has been shown to enhance immune responses in mice. This study examined the immuno-adjuvant capacity of two strains: Lactobacillus acidophilus L10 and Lactobacillus fermentum PC2, in the induction of protective humoral immunity in a Salmonella Typhimurium vaccine challenge model. Briefly, BALB/c mice were divided into four groups. Three groups of mice received S. Typhimurium vaccine (10(8) colony forming units (CFU) per dose) on days 0 and 14. In addition to the vaccine, five doses (10(8) CFU per dose) of either L. acidophilus L10 or L. fermentum PC2 were also administered to a group. All mice were challenged with viable S. Typhimurium on day 28. On day 10 post challenge, the study was terminated and microbial and immunological parameters were assessed. Mice dosed with L. fermentum PC2 in addition to the vaccine had a significantly enhanced S. Typhimurium humoral response. The mice in this group had high levels of lactobacilli in the feces and in association with the Peyer's patches, no detectable levels of either lactobacilli or S. Typhimurium in the spleen, and no detectable weight loss. Mice given L. acidophilus L10 with the vaccine were unable to exhibit elevated S. Typhimurium specific humoral responses. However, there was no detectable S. Typhimurium in the spleens of this group. Interestingly, translocation of lactobacilli into the spleen was observed as well as a slight weight loss was noted in mice that received the L. acidophilus L10 with the vaccine. This study shows that, the L. fermentum PC2 had a greater capacity than the L. acidophilus L10 to act as an oral adjuvant in a S. Typhimurium oral vaccine program and afforded greater protection against a live S. Typhimurium challenge.
TI  - Modulating intestinal immune responses by lipoteichoic acid-deficient Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the mechanism(s) by which the intestinal commensal microbe Lactobacillus acidophilus can affect host immunity, we studied the role of a component of the cell wall, lipoteichoic acid, in colitis. MATERIALS & METHODS: Colitis was induced by the intraperitoneal injection of pathogenic CD4(+)CD25(-)CD45RB(hi) T cells into Rag1(-/-) mice. The parental strain, NCK56, or the lipoteichoic acid-deficient strain, NCK2025, was then administered orally. Fluorescent microscopy was employed to examine resulting cell populations and their cytokine production in the colon. RESULTS: NCK2025 enhanced IL-10 production by dendritic cells and macrophages. Increased numbers of regulatory dendritic cells coincided with the induction of activated FoxP3(+) Tregs. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the oral administration of the genetically modified strain NCK2025 may be an effective immunotherapeutic approach that reprograms the immune response in colonic inflammatory conditions.
TI  - Effect of daily consumption of probiotic yogurt on oxidative stress in pregnant women: a randomized controlled clinical trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to the enhanced oxygen requirement of the mitochondria-rich placenta primarily during the third trimester, pregnancy is associated with elevated levels of oxidative stress. This study was designed to determine the effects of daily consumption of probiotic yogurt on oxidative stress among Iranian pregnant women. METHODS: This randomized single-blind controlled clinical trial was performed among 70 pregnant women, singleton primigravida, aged 18-30 in their third trimester. Subjects were randomly assigned to two groups to consume 200 g/day of either conventional yogurt (n = 33) or probiotic yogurt (n = 37) for 9 weeks. Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after a 9-week intervention to measure oxidative stress parameters. RESULTS: Consumption of probiotic yogurt resulted in increased erythrocyte glutathione reductase (GR) levels as compared to the conventional yogurt (p = 0.01). Despite the significant effect of probiotic yogurt consumption on plasma glutathione (67.9 mumol/l, p = 0.01), erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase (163 mmol/min/ml, p = 0.04) and serum 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine levels (-74.3 ng/ml, p = 0.04), no significant differences were found between the two yogurts in terms of their effects on the mentioned parameters. CONCLUSION: Consumption of probiotic yogurt among pregnant women resulted in increased levels of erythrocyte GR as compared to the conventional yogurt, but could not affect other indices of oxidative stress.
TI  - [Development of pulsed field gel electrophoresis and application for characterization and identification of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus thermophilus].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) method for molecular typing of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus thermophilus (S. thermophilus) and to apply it in identification and characterization of both bacteria isolated from yoghurt collected from Beijing supermarket. METHODS: The five most useful restriction enzymes including Apa I, Not I, Sfi I, Xba I and Sma I were chosen to cut DNA of 52 strains of Lactobacillus, S. thermophilus as well as associated standard bacteria strains. The endonucleases and electrophoresis conditions for PFGE analysis were optimized and applied in molecular typing of Lactobacillus and S.thermophilus isolates. Cluster analysis based on the PFGE data was conducted. The identification results of PFGE were compared with those obtained in biochemical and 16s ribosomal RNA PCR identification tests. RESULTS: Not I was suitable for L. bulgaricus, L. fermentum and L. delbrueckii digestion. While Apa I was an appropriate endonuclease for S. thermophilus, L. acidophilus and L. casei digestion. The results of molecular typing indicated that 24 strains of L.bulgaricus and 15 strains of S. thermophilus were grouped into 8 types by PFGE method, respectively. While 7 strains of L.acidophilus were grouped into 3 types and 2 strains of L. delbrueckii were grouped into 2 different PFGE types. CONCLUSION: The results of PFGE analysis are in compliance with those of 16s rRNA PCR and biochemical identification. The PFGE method developed in this study is suitable for molecular characterization of both Lactobacillus and S. thermophilus.
TI  - Development of an innovative nutraceutical fermented beverage from herbal mate (Ilex paraguariensis A.St.-Hil.) extract.
AB  - Herbal mate (Ilex paraguariensis A.St.-Hil.) leaves are traditionally used for their stimulant, antioxidant, antimicrobial, and diuretic activity, presenting as principal components polyphenolic compounds. The aim of this work was to develop an innovative, non-dairy, functional, probiotic, fermented beverage using herbal mate extract as a natural ingredient which would also be hypocholesterolemic and hepatoprotective. Among different strains used, Lactobacillus acidophilus was selected as the best for fermentation. The addition of honey positively affected the development of L. acidophilus and the formulated beverage maintained microbial stability during shelf life. Key ingredients in the extract included xanthines, polyphenols and other antioxidants with potential health benefits for the consumer. Caffeine levels and antioxidant activity were also studied. Acceptable levels of caffeine and large antioxidant capacity were observed for the formulation when compared to other antioxidant beverages. An advantage of this product is the compliance to organic claims, while providing caffeine, other phyto-stimulants and antioxidant compounds without the addition of synthetic components or preservatives in the formulation. Sensorial analysis demonstrated that the beverage had good consumer acceptance in comparison to two other similar commercial beverages. Therefore, this beverage could be used as a new, non-dairy vehicle for probiotic consumption, especially by vegetarians and lactose intolerant consumers. It is expected that such a product will have good market potential in an era of functional foods.
TI  - Qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of Lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal Chinese women.
AB  - The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of Lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy Chinese women. Vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy Chinese women were analysed using a 16S rRNA gene clone library and species-specific PCR followed by sequencing and real-time PCR. A total of 13 different Lactobacillus species were detected. Species-specific PCR showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of Lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. Among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of Lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. In the fertile women, L. iners (82.61%), L. crispatus (70.65%) and L. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than L. jensenii (40.22%), L. acidophilus (39.13%), L. brevis (23.91%), L. plantarum (5.43%), L. johnsonii (3.26%), L. fermentum (2.17%), L. salivarius (2.17%), L. rhamnosus (1.09%), L. reuteri (1.09%) and L. paracasei (1.09%); L. delbrueckii was not detected. In the postmenopausal women, L. fermentum, L. rhamnosus, L. reuteri and L. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just a few samples. The prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific PCR. According to the semiquantitative analysis, the total Lactobacillus DNA concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. Sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by L. iners, 35% by L. crispatus, and 2% by L. gasseri. Associations between pairs of Lactobacillus species in fertile women were significant (P<0.05) between the following pairs: L. iners and L. gasseri, L. iners and L. jensenii, L. iners and L. acidophilus, L. gasseri and L. acidophilus, and L. gasseri and L. jensenii. In conclusion, this study provided detailed information on Lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy Chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. The study also showed that the diversity of Lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. According to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific PCR and comparison against a 16S rRNA gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. These findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of bacterial communities. According to our findings regarding species associations, L. iners and L. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of other vaginal Lactobacillus species.
TI  - Role of Lactobacillus acidophilus loaded floating beads in chronic fatigue syndrome: behavioral and biochemical evidences.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years the interface between neuropsychiatry and gastroenterology has converged in to a new discipline referred to as enteric neuroscience. Implications of brain-gut communication in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders indicate a possible role of suitably packaged/delivered probiotics as newer therapeutic options. In the present study probable role of per-oral administration of free Lactobacillus acidophilus (LAB) and LAB loaded alginate beads in attenuation of the symptoms associated with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) were evaluated. METHODS: Chronic fatigue syndrome following physical fatigue was induced in rats by forcing them to swim (forced swim test; FST) in water till exhaustion, after weighing them down with 10% their body weight, daily for 28 days. Immobility (I) and postswim fatigue time (PSF) were taken as suitable markers. Free LAB and LAB loaded floating beads (FBs) were administered, from 21 to 28 days. KEY RESULTS: Immobility and PSF were found to increase considerably in FST rats (665 +/- 22 s and 196 +/- 6 s) as compared with the naive (32 +/- 7 s and 22 +/- 2 s) at 20 days, establishing severe fatigue like behavior. FST control group exhibited significant (P < 0.05) hypertrophy of spleen, hypotrophy of thymus, and increased oxido-nitrosative stress in brain and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels in serum. Treatment with LAB and LAB FBs significantly decreased I and PSF and attenuated (P < 0.05) oxido-nitrosative stress and TNF-alpha levels. Spleen and thymus were also restored to their original size in this group. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: The findings suggest a valuable therapeutic role of LAB especially when incorporated into alginate beads for the treatment of CFS.
TI  - Effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCDC 13 supplementation on the progression of obesity in diet-induced obese mice.
AB  - There is an increased interest in investigating the relationship between the gut  microbiota and energy homeostasis. Probiotics are health beneficial microbes mainly categorised under the genus Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which when administered in adequate amounts confer health benefits to the host, and have been implicated in various physiological functions. The potential role of probiotics in energy homeostasis is a current and an emerging area of research. In the present study, Lactobacillus acidophilus NCDC 13 was used to evaluate its anti-obesity potential in diet-induced obese (C57BL/6) mice. The probiotic bacterial culture was administered in Indian yogurt preparation called 'dahi', prepared using native starter cultures, and compared with control dahi containing only dahi starter cultures. The dietary intervention was followed for 8 weeks, and whole-body fat composition, and liver and muscle adiposity were measured using MRI. Changes in gut microbiota were assessed by fluorescent in situ hybridisation in faeces and caecal contents. The feeding of the probiotic brought no changes in body-weight gain, food and dahi intake when compared with the control dahi-fed animals. No significant changes in body fat composition, liver and muscle adiposity were also observed. At the end of the dietary intervention, a significant increase (P < 0.05) in the number of total Bifidobacterium was observed in both faeces and caecal contents of mice as a result of probiotic dahi administration. Thus, L. acidophilus NCDC 13 supplementation could be beneficial in shifting the gut microbiota balance positively. However, its anti-obesity potential could not be established in the present study and warrants further exploration.
TI  - Effect of tween series on growth and Cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid production of Lactobacillus acidophilus F0221 in the presence of bile salts.
AB  - Cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (c9, t11 CLA) producing bacteria have attracted much attention as novel probiotics which have shown beneficial effects on host health. However, bile salts are able to inhibit bacterial growth and c9, t11 CLA production. For recovering growth and c9, t11 CLA production of Lactobacillus acidophilus F0221 in the presence of bile salts, Tween series (Tween 20, Tween 40, Tween 60 and Tween 80) were added in growth culture containing 0.3% oxgall. Results showed that the viable counts were significantly (P < 0.05) recovered to 8.58-8.75 log CFU/mL in the presence of all Tween treatments. However, recovery of c9, t11 CLA production was only demonstrated in the presence of Tween 80 (72.89 mug/mL). Stepwise increasing oxgall in a concentrations range from 0.1% to 0.9% according to human intestinal physiological environments, Tween 80 still showed significant (P < 0.05) recovery ability on growth (8.91-8.04 log CFU/mL) and c9, t11 CLA (69.22-34.27 mug/mL) production. The effect of Tween 80 on growth and production was also investigated in the presence of different types of bile salts (sodium salts of cholic acid (CA), deoxycholic acid (DCA), chendeoxycholic acid (CDCA), glycocholic acid (GCA) and taurocholic acid (TCA)). Results showed that Tween 80 could significantly (P < 0.05) recover c9, t11 CLA production in the presence of all types of bile salts, but the Tween 80 could only significantly (P < 0.05) recover viable counts of the strain in the presence of CA, DCA and CDCA. This recovery ability could be attributed to the protection of leakage of intracellular material. Additionally, although bile salts inhibited growth and c9, t11 CLA production by the growing cell, it promoted the c9, t11 CLA production by the resting cell.
TI  - Antagonistic activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 on the growth and adhesion/invasion characteristics of human Campylobacter jejuni.
AB  - The aim of this research was to determine the potential probiotic activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 against several human Campylobacter jejuni isolates. The ability to inhibit the pathogen's growth was evaluated by co-culture experiments as well as by antimicrobial assays with cell-free culture supernatant (CFCS), while interference with adhesion/invasion to intestinal Caco-2 cells was studied by exclusion, competition, and displacement tests. In the co-culture experiments L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 strain reduced the growth of C. jejuni with variable percentages of inhibition related to the contact time. The CFCS showed inhibitory activity against C. jejuni strains, stability to low pH, and thermal treatment and sensitivity to proteinase K and trypsin. L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 was able to reduce the adhesion and invasion to Caco-2 cells by most of the human C. jejuni strains. Displacement and exclusion mechanisms seem to be the preferred modalities, which caused a significant reduction of adhesion/invasion of pathogens to intestinal cells. The observed inhibitory properties of L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 on growth ability and on cells adhesion/invasion of C. jejuni may offer potential use of this strain for the management of Campylobacter infections.
TI  - Production of potentially probiotic beverages using single and mixed cereal substrates fermented with lactic acid bacteria cultures.
AB  - In the present work, single and mixed cereal substrates were fermented with lactic acid bacteria to study and compare the effect of the media formulation on fermentation parameters. Three cereal flours namely malt, barley and barley mixed with malt (barley-malt) were selected and fermented with two probiotic strains: Lactobacillus plantarum (NCIMB 8826) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (NCIMB 8821). The effect of the single and mixed cereal flour suspensions on the fermentation of these two strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) was studied at an incubation temperature of 30 degrees C for 28 h. It was found that the LAB growth was enhanced in media containing malt and significant amounts of lactic acid were produced (0.5-3.5 g/L). A cell concentration between 7.9 and 8.5 Log(1)(0) CFU/mL and a pH below 4.0 was achieved within 6 h of fermentation. Though the cell populations in the mixed culture fermentations of mixed substrates were similar to the ones obtained with single cereal flours, significant differences in the production of lactic acid were observed. These results suggest that the functional and organoleptic properties of these cereal-based probiotic drinks could be considerably modified through changes in the substrate or inocula composition.
TI  - Survival of freeze-dried microcapsules of alpha-galactosidase producing probiotics in a soy bar matrix.
AB  - Soy oligosaccharides, mainly alpha-galactosides, are prevalently present in soy protein products, and can result in unfavorable digestive effects when consumed. The aim of this research was to investigate the efficiency of alpha-galactoside reduction by probiotic bacterial hydrolysis and if such bacteria could be maintained in a high number in a soy protein product in a microencapsulated and freeze-dried form. The probiotic bacterium, Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-2, when induced by raffinose, exhibited a high level of alpha-galactosidase activity at 5.0 U/mg. To preserve probiotics with high viability, cells were microencapsulated and freeze-dried. Optimization of microencapsulation presented that a combination of kappa-carrageenan and inulin at a proportion of 1.9:0.1 (w:w) as capsule wall materials, significantly retained the viability of the probiotics through freeze-drying (P </= 0.05). Scanning electron microscopic images confirmed that the morphology of the microcapsules was well preserved after freeze-drying. Upon incorporation into soy protein bars, the freeze-dried microcapsules of L. acidophilus LA-2 remained in high numbers throughout 14 weeks of storage at 4 degrees C. Results of this work with the support of other studies on microencapsulation benefits indicate a promising use of freeze-dried alpha-galactosidase positive microencapsulated probiotics in a soy food.
TI  - Fibers from fruit by-products enhance probiotic viability and fatty acid profile  and increase CLA content in yoghurts.
AB  - This study evaluated the effect of the supplementation of total dietary fiber from apple, banana or passion fruit processing by-products on the post-acidification, total titratable acidity, bacteria counts and fatty acid profiles in skim milk yoghurts co-fermented by four different probiotics strains: Lactobacillus acidophilus L10 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BL04, HN019 and B94. Apple and banana fibers increased the probiotic viability during shelf-life. All the fibers were able to increase the short chain and polyunsaturated fatty acid contents of yoghurts compared to their respective controls. A synergistic effect between the type of fiber and the probiotic strain on the conjugated linoleic acid content was observed, and the amount of alpha-linolenic acid was increased by banana fiber. The results of this study demonstrate, for the first time, that fruit fibers can improve the fatty acid profile of probiotic yoghurts and point out the suitability of using fibers from fruit processing the by-products to develop new high value-added fermented dairy products.
TI  - Sensory acceptance and survival of probiotic bacteria in ice cream produced with  different overrun levels.
AB  - The effect of different overrun levels on the sensory acceptance and survival of  probiotic bacteria in ice cream was investigated. Vanilla ice creams supplemented with Lactobacillus acidophilus were processed with overruns of 45%, 60%, and 90%. Viable probiotic bacterial counts and sensory acceptance were assessed. All the ice creams presented a minimum count of 6 log CFU/g at the end of 60 d of frozen storage. However, higher overrun levels negatively influenced cell viability, being reported a decrease of 2 log CFU/g for the 90% overrun treatment. In addition, it was not reported an influence about acceptability with respect to appearance, aroma, and taste of the ice creams (P > 0.05). Overall, the results suggest that lower overrun levels should be adopted during the manufacture of ice cream in order to maintain its probiotic status through the shelf life.
TI  - Supplementation with probiotics modifies gut flora and attenuates liver fat accumulation in rat nonalcoholic fatty liver disease model.
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between gut probiotic flora and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in a diet-induced rat model, and to compare the effects of two different probiotic strains on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into 4 groups for 12 weeks: control (standard rat chow), model (fat-rich diet), Lactobacillus (fat-rich diet plus Lactobacillus acidophilus), and Bifidobacterium (fat-rich diet plus Bifidobacterium longum) groups. Probiotics were provided to rats in drinking water (10(10)/ml). Gut bifidobacteria and lactobacilli were obviously lower at weeks 8 and 10, respectively, in the model group compared with the control group. Supplementation with Bifidobacterium significantly attenuated hepatic fat accumulation (0.10 +/- 0.03 g/g liver tissue) compared with the model group (0.16 +/- 0.03 g/g liver tissue). However, there was no improvement in intestinal permeability in either the Lactobacillus or the Bifidobacterium group compared with the model group. In all 40 rats, the hepatic total lipid content was negatively correlated with gut Lactobacillus (r = -0.623, p = 0.004) and Bifidobacterium (r = -0.591, p = 0.008). Oral supplementation with probiotics attenuates hepatic fat accumulation. Further, Bifidobacterium longum is superior in terms of attenuating liver fat accumulation than is Lactobacillus acidophilus.
TI  - The effect of microbial-nutrient interaction on the immune system of young chicks after early probiotic and organic acid administration.
AB  - The combined effects of probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus faecium, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and organic acids (sorbic and citric acid) on intestinal morphology and expression of immune-related genes were investigated. One-day-old chicks were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: birds not receiving probiotic or organic acids (control; T1), or birds receiving an oral combination (1 g/L in water) of 10(8) CFU/g of each of the aforementioned probiotics and organic acids (1% sorbic acid and 0.2% citric acid) for 7 (T2) or 14 d (T3). Each group was divided into 5 replicate pens of 20 birds each, and 5 birds from each group (1 from each pen) were killed on d 11 and 22. Intestinal sections were collected for histological assessment, and reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis was used to assess defensin and cathelicidins expression. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to assess toll-like receptors (TLR) and cytokine expression. Duodenal villus height was greater in T2 and T3 at d 11 (P </= 0.036) and 22 (P </= 0.015) compared with T1. At d 11, duodenal goblet cell/unit area was less in T3, whereas it was greater in T2 compared with T1 in the jejunum (P = 0.009). Ileal goblet cell/unit area was greater in T3 at d 22 compared with T1 (P < 0.001). Avian beta-defensin-3 was expressed in all tissues except the bursa of T3 birds at d 11, and TLR-2 was down regulated in the cecal tonsil of birds in T2 and T3 at d 11 compared with T1 (P = 0.020 and 0.003, respectively). Expression of IL-12p35 in the ileum at d 11 was down regulated in T2 and T3 compared with T1 (P = 0.030 and 0.012, respectively). Reduced expression of INF-gamma was observed in the ileum in T3 compared with T1 at d 11 (P = 0.047). Ileal IL-6 and IL-10 and cecal tonsil interferon-gamma (INF-gamma) expressions were greater T2 at d 22 (P </= 0.047) than T1. In conclusion, supplementation of combined probiotics and organic acids resulted in inconsistent gut morphology associated responses, and avian beta-defensins and cathelicidins expression were not associated with combined probiotics and organic acids supplementation. Birds supplemented with combined probiotics and organic acids for 7 d showing similar responses in TLR-2, IL-12p35, and IFN-gamma compared with those supplemented for 14 d indicates that shorter periods of supplementation might be enough to elicit beneficial responses.
TI  - [The influence of lactic acid bacteria and yeast on production of staphylococcal  enterotoxins].
AB  - Research of influence of 10 lactic acid bacteria cultures on staphylococcal growth and production of staphylococcal enterotoxins SEA and SEB has shown that lactic acid bacteria slow down SEA in 5,7 fold and SEB - 1,56 fold. All investigated cultures possessed inhibition action on SEA and SEB production. Has been established, what lactic acid bacteria slow down growth of staphylococcus in 1,48 fold. It has shown that appears, that the most effective inhibitors of SEA and SEB production are strains L. casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus 317/402.
TI  - Cytokine profile and induction of T helper type 17 and regulatory T cells by human peripheral mononuclear cells after microbial exposure.
AB  - The immunomodulatory effects of probiotics were assessed following exposure of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), cord blood cells and the spleen-derived monocyte/macrophage cell line CRL-9850 to Lactobacillus acidophilus LAVRI-A1, Lb. rhamnosus GG, exopolysaccharides (EPS)-producing Streptococcus thermophilus St1275, Bifidobacteriun longum BL536, B. lactis B94 and Escherichia coli TG1 strains. The production of a panel of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines by PBMC following bacterial stimulation was measured, using live, heat-killed or mock gastrointestinal tract (GIT)-exposed bacteria, and results show that (i) all bacterial strains investigated induced significant secretion of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines from PBMC-derived monocytes/macrophages; and (ii) cytokine levels increased relative to the expansion of bacterial cell numbers over time for cells exposed to live cultures. Bifidobacteria and S. thermophilus stimulated significant concentrations of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, an interleukin necessary for the differentiation of regulatory T cells (T(reg) )/T helper type 17 (Th17) cells and, as such, the study further examined the induction of Th17 and T(reg) cells after PBMC exposure to selected bacteria for 96 h. Data show a significant increase in the numbers of both cell types in the exposed populations, measured by cell surface marker expression and by cytokine production. Probiotics have been shown to induce cytokines from a range of immune cells following ingestion of these organisms. These studies suggest that probiotics' interaction with immune-competent cells produces a cytokine milieu, exerting immunomodulatory effects on local effector cells, as well as potently inducing differentiation of Th17 and T(reg) cells.
TI  - Comparison of fructooligosaccharide utilization by Lactobacillus and Bacteroides  species.
AB  - The utilization of 1-kestose (GF(2)) and nystose (GF(3)), the main components of  fructooligosaccharides (FOS), by Lactobacillus and Bacteroides species was examined. Of seven Lactobacillus and five Bacteroides strains that utilized FOS, L. salivarius, L. rhamnosus, L. casei, and L. gasseri utilized only GF(2), whereas L. acidophilus and all the Bacteroides strains utilized both GF(2) and GF(3). Only the strains able to utilize both GF(2) and GF(3) had beta-fructosidase activity in the culture supernatants. The culture supernatants of the Lactobacillus strains had higher beta-fructosidase activity for GF(2) than for GF(3), whereas those of the Bacteroides strains had higher activity for GF(3) than for GF(2). Furthermore, beta-fructosidase activity of the culture supernatants of the Lactobacillus cells grown in the GF(3) medium was much higher than that of the cells grown in the GF(2) medium, whereas the activity of the culture supernatants of the Bacteroides cells grown in the GF(3) medium was almost the same as that of the cells grown in the GF(2) medium. These results indicate that Lactobacillus species metabolize FOS in a different way from that of Bacteroides species.
TI  - Evidence for Gardnerella vaginalis uptake and internalization by squamous vaginal epithelial cells: implications for the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV), a common condition seen in premenopausal women, is associated with preterm labor, pelvic inflammatory disease, and delivery of low birth weight infants. Gardnerella vaginalis is the predominant bacterial species associated with BV, although its exact role in the pathology of BV is unknown. Using immunofluorescence, confocal and transmission electron microscopy, we found that VK2 vaginal epithelial cells take up G. vaginalis after exposure to the bacteria. Confocal microscopy also indicated the presence of internalized G. vaginalis within vaginal epithelial cells obtained from a subject with BV. Using VK2 cells and (35)S labeled bacteria in an invasion assay, we found that a 1 h uptake of G. vaginalis was 21.8-fold higher than heat-killed G. vaginalis, 84-fold compared to Lactobacillus acidophilus and 6.6-fold compared to Lactobacillus crispatus. Internalization was inhibited by pre-exposure of cells to cytochalasin-D. In addition, the cytoskeletal protein vimentin was upregulated in VK2 cells exposed to G. vaginalis, but there was no change in actin cytoskeletal polymerization/rearrangements or vimentin subcellular relocalization post exposure. Cytoskeletal protein modifications could represent a potential mechanism for G. vaginalis mediated internalization by vaginal epithelial cells. Finally, understanding vaginal bacteria/host interactions will allow us to better understand the underlying mechanisms of BV pathogenesis.
TI  - Expression and characterization of an endo-1,4-beta-galactanase from Emericella nidulans in Pichia pastoris for enzymatic design of potentially prebiotic oligosaccharides from potato galactans.
AB  - Potato pulp is a high-volume side-stream from industrial potato starch manufacturing. Enzymatically solubilized beta-1,4-galactan-rich potato pulp polysaccharides of molecular weights >100 kDa (SPPP) are highly bifidogenic in human fecal sample fermentations in vitro. The objective of the present study was to use potato beta-1,4-galactan and the SPPP as substrates for enzymatic production of potentially prebiotic compounds of lower and narrower molecular weight. A novel endo-1,4-beta-galactanase from Emericella nidulans (anamorph Aspergillus nidulans), GH family 53, was produced in a recombinant Pichia pastoris strain. The enzyme was purified by Cu(2+) affinity chromatography and its optimal reaction conditions were determined to pH 5 and 49 degrees C via a statistical experimental design. The specific activity of the E. nidulans enzyme expressed in P. pastoris was similar to that of an endo-1,4-beta-galactanase from Aspergillus niger used as benchmark. The E. nidulans enzyme expressed in P. pastoris generated a spectrum poly- and oligo-saccharides which were fractionated by membrane filtration. The potential growth promoting properties of each fraction were evaluated by growth of beneficial gut microbes and pathogenic bacteria. All the galactan- and SPPP-derived products promoted the growth of probiotic strains of Bifidobacterium longum and Lactobacillus acidophilus and generally did not support the propagation of Clostridium perfringens in single culture fermentations. Notably the growth of B. longum was significantly higher (p<0.05) or at least as good on galactan- and SPPP-derived products as fructooligosaccharides (FOS). Except in one case these products did not support the growth of the pathogen Cl. perfringens to any significant extent.
TI  - Grape antioxidant dietary fiber stimulates Lactobacillus growth in rat cecum.
AB  - The digesta is a highly active biological system where epithelial cells, microbiota, nondigestible dietary components, and a large number of metabolic products interact. The gut microbiota can be modulated by both endogenous and exogenous substrates. Undigested dietary residues are substrates for colonic microbiota and may influence gut microbial ecology. The objective of this work was to study the capacity of grape antioxidant dietary fiber (GADF), which is rich in polyphenols, to modify the bacterial profile in the cecum of rats. Male adult Wistar rats were fed for 4 wk with diets containing either cellulose or GADF as dietary fiber. The effect of GADF on bacterial growth was evaluated in vitro and on the cecal microbiota of rats using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The results showed that GADF intake stimulates proliferation of Lactobacillus and slightly affects the composition of Bifidobacterium species. GADF was also found to have a stimulative effect on Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus acidophilus in vitro. These findings suggest that the consumption of a diet rich in plant foods with high dietary fiber and polyphenol content may enhance the gastrointestinal health of the host through microbiota modulation. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Grape antioxidant fiber combines nutritional and physiological properties of dietary fiber and natural antioxidants from grapes. Grape antioxidant fiber could be used as an ingredient for functional foods and as a dietary supplement to increase the intake of dietary fiber and bioactive compounds.
TI  - Synbiotic (probiotic and ginger extract) loaded floating beads: a novel therapeutic option in an experimental paradigm of gastric ulcer.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the use of a bioactive phytochemical, namely ginger extract (GE), for its antioxidant and antiulcer effects, and also for supporting probiotic growth and activity. Use of probiotics is limited in therapy because of their transience and inability to survive the adverse physiological conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. Packaging probiotics in a suitably designed pharmaceutical system with GE may facilitate their establishment in the stomach mucosa. METHODS: A probiotic (Lactobacillus acidophilus) and GE were simultaneously and individually encapsulated/immobilized in alginate floating beads. The developed system was evaluated for diameter, buoyancy, entrapment, porosity, in-vitro viability/release and pharmacodynamics in a cold restraint stress induced gastric ulcer model in rats. KEY FINDING: The developed floating beads stayed in the stomach for more than 10 h and both agents were released slowly and over a prolonged period from these beads. Significant and promising results were obtained for the combination (synbiotic) system in terms of ulcer index, mucus secretion, oxidative stress and histopathological parameters, as compared with the individual agents. The developed system could completely revert the damage induced in ulcerated stomachs at physiological (ulcer index and mucus secretion), biochemical (oxidative stress) and histological levels. CONCLUSION: This study establishes that suitable packaging of GE and Lactobacillus acidophilus together in floating beads can help exploit their prospects as therapeutic curative agents rather than potential preventive agents.
TI  - Evaluation of the effect of CaCl2 and alginate concentrations and hardening time  on the characteristics of Lactobacillus acidophilus loaded alginate beads using response surface analysis.
AB  - PURPOSE: This article describes preparation and characterization of beads of alginate containing probiotic bacteria of Lactobacillus acidophilus DMSZ20079. METHODS: Fourteen formulations using different alginate (ALG) and CaCl2 concentrations as well as hardening times were prepared using extrusion technique. The prepared beads were characterized in terms of size, morphology, encapsulation efficiency and bacterial viabilities in acid (pH 1.8, 2 hours) condition. RESULTS: The results showed that spherical beads with narrow size distribution ranging from 1.32+/-0.04 to 1.70+/-0.07 mm were achieved with encapsulation efficiency higher than 98%. Surface response analysis revealed that alginate concentration was the important factor for the size, shape and encapsulation efficiency of prepared beads. Furthermore, survived bacteria after acid exposure in all prepared beads (63-83%) were significantly higher than those of untreated cells (39%) and enhanced by increasing alginate concentration. Surface response analysis revealed that the effect of all three factors of alginate and CaCl2 concentrations as well as hardening times were significant in acid viability, however alginate concentration played the most important role according to its regression coefficient. CONCLUSION: Among alginate and CaCl2 concentrations as well as hardening times, alginate concentration was the most variable in the characteristics of Alginate beads.
TI  - Antibacterial and phytochemical studies on Calotropis gigantia (L.) R. Br. latex  against selected cariogenic bacteria.
AB  - In vitro antibacterial potential of the chloroform, ethyl acetate, hexane, methanol and aqueous extracts of Calotropis gigantia (L.) R. Br. was evaluated by using five cariogenic bacteria, Actinomyces viscosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus mutans. Agar well diffusion method and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were used for this purpose. The chloroform extracted fraction of latex showed inhibitory effect against S. mutans and L. acidophilus with MIC value of 0.032 and 0.52 mg/mL, respectively. Qualitative investigation on structure elucidation of bioactive compound using IR, NMR and GC-MS techniques revealed the presence of methyl nonanoate, a saturated fatty acid.
TI  - Antiasthmatic Effects of Herbal Complex MA and Its Fermented Product MA128.
AB  - This study was conducted to determine if oral administration of the novel herbal  medicine, MA, and its Lactobacillus acidophilus fermented product, MA128, have therapeutic properties for the treatment of asthma. Asthma was induced in BALB/c mice by systemic sensitization to ovalbumin (OVA) followed by intratracheal, intraperitoneal, and aerosol allergen challenges. MA and MA128 were orally administered 6 times a week for 4 weeks. At 1 day after the last ovalbumin exposure, airway hyperresponsiveness was assessed and samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, lung cells, and serum were collected for further analysis. We investigated the effect of MA and MA128 on airway hyperresponsiveness, pulmonary eosinophilic infiltration, various immune cell phenotypes, Th2 cytokine production, OVA-specific IgE production, and Th1/Th2 cytokine production in this mouse model of asthma. In BALB/c mice, we found that MA and MA128 treatment suppressed eosinophil infiltration into airways and blood, allergic airway inflammation and AHR by suppressing the production of IL-5, IL-13, IL-17, Eotaxin, and OVA-specific IgE, by upregulating the production of OVA-specific Th1 cytokine (IFN-gamma), and by downregulating OVA-specific Th2 cytokine (IL-4) in the culture supernatant of spleen cells. The effectiveness of MA was increased by fermentation with Lactobacillus acidophilus.
TI  - Effect of antioxidant activity and functional properties of Chingshey purple sweet potato fermented milk by Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and L. gasseri strains.
AB  - In this study, individual selected lactic acid bacteria strains Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA), L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis (LDL), and L. gasseri (LGA) were grown in Chingshey purple sweet potato (CPSP) substrate/media. CPSP is rich in anthocyanin, which possesses antioxidant activity and in vitro cell assay. The antioxidant ability and functional properties of the fermented milk were examined. High-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method was used to analyze the free amino acid, organic acids, and anthocyanin content. Total phenolic compounds, scavenging effects of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picyl-hydrazyl (DPPH) radicals, and scavenging effects of superoxide anion radicals were determined to evaluate the antioxidant ability of the samples. The cell proliferation of the fermented PSP milk was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethyldiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyl Tetrazolium Bromide (MTT) assay. The result indicated that the antioxidant ability of the fermented CPSP milk through LA, LDL, and LGA strains was significantly higher than CPSP. The main anthocyanins present in the samples are cyanidin and delphinidin. MTT assay has revealed that incubation with both PSP and fermented CPSP milk prevented the cell death of macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells. The potential health benefit of fermented PSP milk through LA, LDL, and LGA strains makes the further application of CPSP in health food highly worthwhile. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: (1) In our study, we have employed the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), organic acid contents, total phenol content, anthocyanins content, DPPH, oxygen radical absorbance capacity, superoxide dismutase activity assay, and cytotoxicity assay to assess the functional properties of fermented CPSP milk by different lactic acid bacteria. (2) Our results have revealed that the fermented CPSP milk samples possess high GABA concentrations, organic acid contents, anthocyanins contents, and antioxidant activity. This will provide potential opportunity to develop different functional food products from fermented CPSP milk. (3) The potential health benefit of fermented CPSP milk makes the further application of CPSP in health food highly worthwhile.
TI  - Differential targeting of the E-Cadherin/beta-Catenin complex by gram-positive probiotic lactobacilli improves epithelial barrier function.
AB  - The intestinal ecosystem is balanced by dynamic interactions between resident and incoming microbes, the gastrointestinal barrier, and the mucosal immune system. However, in the context of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), where the integrity of the gastrointestinal barrier is compromised, resident microbes contribute to the development and perpetuation of inflammation and disease. Probiotic bacteria have been shown to exert beneficial effects, e.g., enhancing epithelial barrier integrity. However, the mechanisms underlying these beneficial effects are only poorly understood. Here, we comparatively investigated the effects of four probiotic lactobacilli, namely, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. fermentum, L. gasseri, and L. rhamnosus, in a T84 cell epithelial barrier model. Results of DNA microarray experiments indicating that lactobacilli modulate the regulation of genes encoding in particular adherence junction proteins such as E-cadherin and beta-catenin were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). Furthermore, we show that epithelial barrier function is modulated by Gram-positive probiotic lactobacilli via their effect on adherence junction protein expression and complex formation. In addition, incubation with lactobacilli differentially influences the phosphorylation of adherence junction proteins and the abundance of protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms such as PKCdelta that thereby positively modulates epithelial barrier function. Further insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms triggered by these probiotics might also foster the development of novel strategies for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases (e.g., IBD).
TI  - High dose and low dose Lactobacillus acidophilus exerted differential immune modulating effects on T cell immune responses induced by an oral human rotavirus vaccine in gnotobiotic pigs.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Strain-specific effects of probiotics in pro- or anti-inflammatory immune responses have been well recognized. Several proinflammatory Lactobacillus strains have been shown to act as adjuvants to enhance the immunogenicity of vaccines. However, dose effects of probiotics in modulating immune responses are not clearly understood. This study examined the dose effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) NCFM strain on T cell immune responses to rotavirus vaccination in a gnotobiotic (Gn) pig model. METHODS: Frequencies of IFN-gamma producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cell and IL-10 and TGF-beta producing CD4+CD25+ and CD4+CD25- regulatory T (Treg) cell responses were determined in the intestinal and systemic lymphoid tissues of Gn pigs vaccinated with an oral human rotavirus vaccine in conjunction with low dose (5 feedings; up to 10(6) colony forming units [CFU]/dose) or high dose (14 feedings; up to 10(9)CFU/dose) or without LA feeding. RESULTS: Low dose LA significantly promoted IFN-gamma producing T cell responses and down-regulated Treg cell responses and their TGF-beta and IL-10 productions in all the tissues compared to the high dose LA and control groups. To the contrary, high dose LA increased the frequencies of Treg cells in most of the tissues compared to the control groups. The dose effects of LA on IFN-gamma producing T cell and CD4+CD25- Treg cell immune responses were similar in the intestinal and systemic lymphoid tissues and were independent from the vaccination. CONCLUSION: Thus the same probiotic strain in different doses can either promote or suppress IFN-gamma producing T cell or Treg cell immune responses. These findings have significant implications in the use of probiotic lactobacilli as immunostimulatory versus immunoregulatory agents. Probiotics can be ineffective or even detrimental if not used at the optimal dosage for the appropriate purposes.
TI  - Effect of a synbiotic on microbial community structure in a continuous culture model of the gastric microbiota in enteral nutrition patients.
AB  - Patients with dysphagia require long-term nutritional support. This can be delivered by the enteral route via a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. Enteral nutrition (EN) bypasses the body's innate defences that prevent the microbial colonization of the proximal gut, which predisposes to microbial overgrowth. A continuous culture model simulating the upper gastrointestinal tract microbiota of EN patients was used to investigate the effects of a synbiotic (Lactobacillus acidophilus DUN-311, Bifidobacterium bifidum BB-02, Bifidobacterium lactis BL-01, Synergy 1) on microbial community structure and metabolism. A PEG tube was inserted into the fermenters to study biofilm formation. The synbiotic delivered in sterile semi-skimmed milk (SSSM) was introduced either 48 h prior to or after PEG tube insertion. The synbiotic reduced biofilm formation on PEG tube surfaces, with suppression of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae when it was added subsequent to PEG insertion. When synbiotic feeding was commenced prior to PEG insertion, colonization by Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and Candida famata was also inhibited. Lactate production increased in response the synbiotic or control (SSSM). These results indicate that the use of a synbiotic has the potential to reduce pathogen colonization on PEG tube surfaces in vivo, thereby reducing the incidence of biofilm-related infectious complications.
TI  - The effect of using different probiotic cultures on conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) concentration and fatty acid composition of white pickle cheese.
AB  - Pickle white cheeses were produced from whole milk with five different probiotic  cultures (Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus paracasei, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium bifidum and Lactobacillus acidophilus). Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) content of cheeses ranged from 3.52 to 3.92 mg/g. Probiotic differences and storage process have not affected the CLA contents of the samples statistically. There was no correlation between the CLA content of all probiotic cheeses and saturated fatty acids. A positive correlation between the CLA and linoleic acid contents of L. paracasei and L. acidophilus cheeses was observed.
TI  - The effect of a multispecies probiotic mixture on the symptoms and fecal microbiota in diarrhea-dominant irritable bowel syndrome: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical effect of probiotics on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is still controversial. AIMS: We aimed to evaluate the effects of a probiotic mixture on IBS symptoms and the composition of fecal microbiota in patients with diarrhea-dominant IBS (D-IBS). METHODS: Fifty patients with D-IBS were randomized into placebo or probiotic mixture (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium lactis, Bifidobacterium longum, and Streptococcus thermophilus 1.0x10 CFU) groups. Treatment was taken daily for 8 weeks. The primary outcome was adequate relief (AR) of overall IBS symptoms, which was assessed weekly for 10 weeks. A responder was defined as a patient who experienced AR for at least half of the 10-week study period. Secondary outcomes included the effects on individual symptoms, stool parameters, and IBS quality of life. The fecal flora compositions were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). RESULTS: The proportion of AR was consistently higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo group throughout the 10-week period (P<0.05). The proportion of responders was significantly higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo group (48% vs. 12%, P=0.01). Stool consistency improved significantly in the probiotics group compared with the placebo group. Percent changes in individual symptom scores were similar in the 2 groups, but IBS quality of life improvement tended to be higher in the probiotics group. Comparison of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles of fecal flora showed that the concordance rate between bacterial compositions before and after treatment was significantly higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo group (69.5% vs. 56.5%, P=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The probiotic mixture was effective in providing AR of overall IBS symptoms and improvement of stool consistency in D-IBS patients, although it had no significant effect on individual symptoms. The therapeutic effect of probiotics is associated with the stabilization of intestinal microbiota.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of different lactic acid bacteria strains.
AB  - Five lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains belonging to species Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus were tested for their susceptibility to 27 antibiotics. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of each antimicrobial were determined using a microdilution test. Among the strains a high susceptibility was detected for most of the cell-wall synthesis inhibitors (penicillins, cefoxitin and vancomycin) and resistance toward inhibitors of DNA synthesis (trimethoprim/sulfonamides and fluoroquinolones). Generally, the Lactobacillus strains were inhibited by antibiotics such as chloramphenicol, erythromycin and tetracycline at breakpoint levels lower or equal to the levels defined by the European Food Safety Authority. Despite the very similar profile of S. thermophilus LC201 to lactobacilli, the detection of resistance toward erythromycin necessitates the performance of additional tests in order to prove the absence of transferable resistance genes.
TI  - Bacteriocin production and resistance to drugs are advantageous features for Lactobacillus acidophilus La-14, a potential probiotic strain.
AB  - L. acidophilus La-14 produces bacteriocin active against L. monocytogenes ScottA  (1600 AU/ml) in MRS broth at 30 degrees C or 37 degrees C. The bacteriocin proved inhibitory to different serological types of Listeria spp. Antimicrobial activity was completely lost after treatment of the cell-free supernatant with proteolytic enzymes. Addition of bacteriocin produced by L. acidophilus La-14 to a 3 h-old culture of L. monocytogenes ScottA repressed cell growth in the following 8h. Treatment of stationary phase cells of L. monocytogenes ScottA (107-108 CFU/ml) by the bacteriocin resulted in growth inhibition. Growth of L. acidophilus La-14 was not inhibited by commercial drugs from different generic groups, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) containing diclofenac potassium or ibuprofen arginine. Only one non-antibiotic drug tested, Atlansil (an antiarrhythmic agent), had an inhibitory effect on L. acidophilus La-14 with MIC of 2.5 mg/ml. L. acidophilus La-14 was not affected by drugs containing sodium or potassium diclofenac. L. acidophilus La-14 shows a good resistance to several drugs and may be applied in combination for therapeutic use.
TI  - Probiotic yogurt improves antioxidant status in type 2 diabetic patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Oxidative stress plays a major role in the pathogenesis and progression of diabetes. Among various functional foods with an antioxidant effect, probiotic foods have been reported to repress oxidative stress. The objective of this clinical trial was to assess the effects of probiotic and conventional yogurt on blood glucose and antioxidant status in type 2 diabetic patients. METHODS: Sixty-four patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, 30 to 60 y old, were assigned to two groups in this randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial. The patients in the intervention group consumed 300 g/d of probiotic yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 and those in the control group consumed 300 g/d of conventional yogurt for 6 wk. Fasting blood samples, 24-h dietary recalls, and anthropometric measurements were collected at the baseline and at the end of the trial. RESULTS: Probiotic yogurt significantly decreased fasting blood glucose (P < 0.01) and hemoglobin A1c (P < 0.05) and increased erythrocyte superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities and total antioxidant status (P < 0.05) compared with the control group. In addition, the serum malondialdehyde concentration significantly decreased compared with the baseline value in both groups (P < 0.05). No significant changes from baseline were shown in insulin concentration and erythrocyte catalase activity within either group (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The consumption of probiotic yogurt improved fasting blood glucose and antioxidant status in type 2 diabetic patients. These results suggest that probiotic yogurt is a promising agent for diabetes management.
TI  - Production of xylooligosaccharides from corncob xylan by fungal xylanase and their utilization by probiotics.
AB  - The selective production of xylooligosaccharides (XOS) was carried out using partially purified xylanase from Aspergillus foetidus MTCC 4898. Corncob xylan was extracted using a mild alkali treatment which yielded 178.73+/-5.8 g of xylan/kg of corncobs. Partially purified beta-xylosidase free xylanase was found efficient in releasing xylooligosaccharides from corncob xylan. Maximum yield of xylooligosaccharides was 6.73+/-0.23 mg/ml after 8 h of reaction time using 20 U of xylanase at 45 degrees C. Purification of XOS was done using activated charcoal column chromatography. The purified XOS preparation contained mainly xylobiose and xylotriose. XOS mixture was found suitable for food industry looking at its high thermal stability at low pH. Prebiotic effect of XOS was evaluated by in vitro fermentation of XOS using known probiotic strains viz. Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus acidophilus. The results of this study revealed better growth of Bifidobacterium spp. on XOS than Lactobacillus spp.
TI  - Effect of daily consumption of probiotic yoghurt on lipid profiles in pregnant women: a randomized controlled clinical trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to enhanced fat storage primarily during the mid-pregnancy period, pregnancy is associated with elevated levels of lipid profiles. To our knowledge, no reports are available indicating the effects of probiotic yoghurt consumption on serum lipid profiles in pregnant women. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to determine the effects of daily consumption of probiotic yoghurt on lipid profiles of Iranian pregnant women. METHODS: This randomized single-blinded controlled clinical trial was performed among 70 pregnant women, primigravida, aged 18-30 years old who were carrying singleton pregnancy at their third trimester. Subjects were randomly assigned to consume 200 g/d of conventional (n=33) or the probiotic group (n=37) for 9 weeks. The probiotic yoghurt was a commercially available product prepared with the starter cultures of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus, enriched with probiotic culture of two strains of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus acidophilus LA5) and bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium animalis BB12) with a total of min 1 x 10(7) colony-forming units. The conventional yoghurt contained the starter cultures of S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus. Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after 9-weeks intervention to measure serum lipid profiles. RESULTS: Although consumption of probiotic yogurt for 9 weeks had been resulted in a significant reduction in serum total- (-53.7 mg/dL, p=0.001), LDL- (-35.2 mg/dL, p=0.006) and HDL-cholesterol levels (-9.8 mg/dL, p=0.002) as well as serum triglyceride concentrations (-42.8 mg/dL, p=0.029), no significant differences were found comparing probiotic and conventional yogurts in terms of their effect on serum lipid profiles. Within-Group differences in conventional yogurt group revealed a significant reduction in HDL-cholesterol levels (-8.4 mg/dL, p=0.005) and borderline significant reduction in serum total cholesterol concentrations (-21.6 mg/dL, p=0.08). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, consumption of probiotic yogurt among pregnant women could not affect serum lipid profiles as compared to the conventional yogurt.

TI  - Anti-genotoxic potential of casein phosphopeptides (CPPs): a class of fermented milk peptides against low background radiation and prevention of cancer in radiation workers.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Radiation workers are constantly exposed to low background radiation  which is their occupational hazard. This continuous and prolonged exposure produces genotoxicity and cancerous condition in many workers. The authors have tested casein phosphopeptides (CPP) as a radioprotectant against low background radiation using animal models. METHODS: Fermented milk was produced by addition of a bacterial culture, Lactobacillus acidophilus to a commercially available milk brand. After the fermentation process is completed in the milk, CPP is isolated from fermented milk by enzymatic hydrolysis-based method. The radioprotective role of CPP was proved using albino mice and Catla catla fish. RESULTS: The micronucleus assay showed higher level of cell deformation and micronucleus formation in the control animal cells than the test animal cells. CPP has found to be having radioprotective activity potential. CONCLUSIONS: This radioprotective potential of CPP can be harnessed to produce formulations which can be used by radiation workers and personnel exposed to low ionization background as an occupational hazard, thus reducing the risk and preventing any type of cancer.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus contributes to a healthy environment for vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  - Lactobacillus species in the female genital tract are thought to act as a barrier to infection. Several studies have demonstrated that lactobacilli can adhere to vaginal epithelial cells. However, little is known about how the adherence of lactobacilli to vaginal epithelial cells affects the acidity, cell viability, or proliferation of the lactobacilli themselves or those of vaginal epithelial cells. Lactobacillus acidophilus was co-cultured with immortalized human vaginal epithelial cells (MS74 cell line), and the growth of L. acidophilus and the acidity of the culture medium were measured. MS74 cell density and viability were also assessed by counting cell numbers and observing the cell attachment state. L. acidophilus showed exponential growth for the first 6 hr until 9 hr, and the pH was maintained close to 4.0-5.0 at 24 hr after culture, consistent with previous studies. The growth curve of L. acidophilus or the pH values were relatively unaffected by co-culture with MS74 cells, confirming that L. acidophilus maintains a low pH in the presence of MS74 cells. This co-culture model could therefore potentially be used to mimic vaginal conditions for future in vitro studies. On the other hand, MS74 cells co-cultured with L. acidophilus more firmly attached to the culture plate, and a higher number of cells were present compared to cells cultured in the absence of L. acidophilus. These results indicate that L. acidophilus increases MS74 cell proliferation and viability, suggesting that lactobacilli may contribute to the healthy environment for vaginal epithelial cells.
TI  - Spoilage characteristics of traditionally packaged ground beef with added lactic  acid bacteria displayed at abusive temperatures.
AB  - Growth of pathogenic organisms such as Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella spp. can be inhibited in ground beef through the addition of certain lactic acid-producing bacteria (LAB; Lactobacillus acidophilus NP51, Lactobacillus crispatus NP35, Pediococcus acidilactici, and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis). This study evaluated the effects of LAB inclusion on the organoleptic and biochemical properties typically associated with spoilage in traditionally packaged ground beef displayed at abusive (10 degrees C) temperatures for 36 h. Trained and untrained panelist evaluations of lean color and off-odor, as well as instrumental color analyses, did not indicate an effect on spoilage traits due to LAB utilization (P > 0.05). However, display length affected each variable independently and was indicative of decreased stability and acceptability as display time (h) increased (P < 0.05). Thiobarbituric acid values were decreased for ground beef with added LAB (P < 0.05), but likely can be related to bacterial degradation of lipid oxidation by-products because no reduction in organoleptic traits due to oxidation was noted between treatments. Overall, LAB did not adversely influence the spoilage characteristics of traditionally packaged ground beef displayed at abusive temperatures for up to 36 h. Furthermore, biochemical and sensory indicators of spoilage were present for all treatments at the conclusion of display. Therefore, LAB can be added to ground beef in traditional packaging as a processing intervention without masking or delaying the expected spoilage characteristics.
TI  - Six-week consumption of a wild blueberry powder drink increases bifidobacteria in the human gut.
AB  - Wild blueberries are a rich source of polyphenols and other compounds that are highly metabolized by the intestinal microbiota and may, at the same time, affect the intestinal environment itself. A repeated-measure, crossover dietary intervention on human volunteers was designed to study the effect of six week consumption of a wild blueberry ( Vaccinium angustifolium ) drink, versus a placebo drink, in modulating the intestinal microbiota. Relative to total eubacteria, Bifidobacterium spp. significantly increased following blueberry treatment (P </= 0.05), while Lactobacillus acidophilus increased after both treatments (P </= 0.05). No significant differences were observed for Bacteroides spp., Prevotella spp., Enterococcus spp., and Clostridium coccoides . Bifidobacteria, which have been largely proposed to be of benefit for the host, appeared to be selectively favored suggesting an important role for the polyphenols and fiber present in wild blueberries. Results obtained suggest that regular consumption of a wild blueberry drink can positively modulate the composition of the intestinal microbiota.
TI  - Treatment with probiotics in experimental oral colonization by Candida albicans in murine model (DBA/2).
AB  - The aim of this study is to evaluate the oral colonization by Candida albicans in experimental murine immunosuppressed DBA/2 and treatment with probiotic bacteria. To achieve these objectives, 152 DBA/2-immunosuppressed mice were orally inoculated with a suspension of C. albicans containing 10(8) viable yeast cells, the animals were treated with nystatin or with the probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus rhamnosus). Evaluations were performed by Candida count from oral mucosa swabbing. The oral mucosa colonization by C. albicans started at day 1 after inoculation, remained maximal from day 3 until day 7, and then decreased significantly. Probiotics reduced the C. albicans colonization significantly on the oral mucosa in comparison with the untreated animal group. In the group treated with L. rhamnosus, the reduction in yeast colonization was significantly higher compared with that of the group receiving nystatin. Immunosuppressed animal model DBA/2 is a relevant model for experimental Candida oral colonization, and the treatment with probiotics in this model may be an effective alternative to prevent it.
TI  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of natural infant fluoride-free toothpastes on oral micro-organisms.
AB  - PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of six toothpastes for infants: 3 fluoride-free experimental toothpastes--cashew-based, mango-based and without plant extract and fluoride compared with 2 commercially fluoride-free toothpastes and 1 fluoridated toothpastes. METHODS: Six toothpastes for infants were evaluated in this study: (1) experimental cashew-based toothpaste; (2) experimental mango-based toothpaste; (3) experimental toothpaste without plant extract and fluoride (negative control); (4) First Teeth brand toothpaste; (5) Weleda brand toothpaste; and (6) Tandy brand toothpaste (positive control). The antimicrobial activity was recorded against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Candida albicans using the agar plate diffusion test. RESULTS: First Teeth, Weleda, mango-based toothpaste, and toothpaste without plant extract presented no antimicrobial effect against any of the tested micro-organisms. Cashew toothpaste had antimicrobial activity against S mutans, S sobrinus, and L acidophilus, but it showed no antimicrobial activity against C albicans. There was no statistical difference between the inhibition halo of cashew and Tandy toothpastes against S mutans and L acidophilus. CONCLUSIONS: Cashew fluoride-free toothpaste had inhibitory activity against Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus, and these results were similar to those obtained for fluoridated toothpaste.
TI  - Entrapment of Lactobacillus acidophilus into alginate beads for the effective treatment of cold restraint stress induced gastric ulcer.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus (LAB) loaded alginate floating beads (FBs) were developed with an intent to (i) preserve their viability during manufacture and upon exposure to adverse physiological conditions existing in the stomach, (ii) achieve an increased stay of the system in the stomach for improved pharmacodynamics and to provide for their effective establishment within the gastric mucosa. In vitro characterization of developed beads was performed in terms of entrapment efficiency, buoyancy, and surface as well as cross sectional morphology and viability studies of LAB in a gastric environment. The developed system was evaluated and was found to be significantly better in an experimental model of cold restraint stress (CRS) induced gastric ulcer model in terms of ulcer index, hemorrhagic streak length, histopathological and biochemical markers and their cross talk with reactive oxygen/nitrogen species. The present study emphasizes the advantages and future potential of probiotic loaded FBs in gastric disorders.
TI  - Heterologous protein display on the cell surface of lactic acid bacteria mediated by the s-layer protein.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have revealed that the C-terminal region of the S-layer protein from Lactobacillus is responsible for the cell wall anchoring, which provide an approach for targeting heterologous proteins to the cell wall of lactic acid bacteria (LAB). In this study, we developed a new surface display system in lactic acid bacteria with the C-terminal region of S-layer protein SlpB of Lactobacillus crispatus K2-4-3 isolated from chicken intestine. RESULTS: Multiple sequence alignment revealed that the C-terminal region (LcsB) of Lb. crispatus K2-4-3 SlpB had a high similarity with the cell wall binding domains SA and CbsA of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lb. crispatus. To evaluate the potential application as an anchoring protein, the green fluorescent protein (GFP) or beta-galactosidase (Gal) was fused to the N-terminus of the LcsB region, and the fused proteins were successfully produced in Escherichia coli, respectively. After mixing them with the non-genetically modified lactic acid bacteria cells, the fused GFP-LcsB and Gal-LcsB were functionally associated with the cell surface of various lactic acid bacteria tested. In addition, the binding capacity could be improved by SDS pretreatment. Moreover, both of the fused proteins could simultaneously bind to the surface of a single cell. Furthermore, when the fused DNA fragment of gfp:lcsB was inserted into the Lactococcus lactis expression vector pSec:Leiss:Nuc, the GFP could not be secreted into the medium under the control of the nisA promoter. Western blot, in-gel fluorescence assay, immunofluorescence microscopy and SDS sensitivity analysis confirmed that the GFP was successfully expressed onto the cell surface of L. lactis with the aid of the LcsB anchor. CONCLUSION: The LcsB region can be used as a functional scaffold to target the heterologous proteins to the cell surfaces of lactic acid bacteria in vitro and in vivo, and has also the potential for biotechnological application.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of an Amazon medicinal plant (Chancapiedra) (Phyllanthus niruri L.) against Helicobacter pylori and lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The potential of water extracts of the Amazon medicinal plant Chancapiedra (Phyllanthus niruri L.) from Ecuador and Peru for antimicrobial activity against Helicobacter pylori and different strains of lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus plantarum was investigated. H. pylori was inhibited by both water extracts in a dose dependent manner, whereas lactic acid bacterial growth was not affected. Both extracts contained ellagic acid and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives and exhibited high free radical scavenging linked-antioxidant activities (89%). However, gallic acid was detected only in the Ecuadorian extract. Preliminary studies on the mode of action of Chancapiedra against H. pylori revealed that inhibition may not involve proline dehydrogenase-based oxidative phosphorylation inhibition associated with simple mono-phenolics and could involve ellagitannins or other non-phenolic compounds through a yet unknown mechanism. This study provides evidence about the potential of Chancapiedra for H. pylori inhibition without affecting beneficial lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus KFRI342 on the development of chemically induced precancerous growths in the rat colon.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus KFRI342, isolated from the Korean traditional food kimchi, was investigated for its suitability as a dietary probiotic. The effects of L. acidophilus KFRI342 on the development of chemically induced (1,2-dimethylhydrazine; DMH) precancerous cytological changes of the colon were investigated in rats. Forty-five male F344 rats were randomly divided into three dietary groups. The control group received a high-fat diet (HF), a second group received a high-fat diet containing the carcinogen (HFC), and a final group received a high-fat diet containing the carcinogen and L. acidophilus KFRI342 (HFCL). L. acidophilus KFRI342 was administered orally three times per week at 2x10(9) c.f.u. ml(-1). L. acidophilus KFRI342 treatments decreased the number of Escherichia coli in faecal samples, the enzyme activities of beta-glucuronidase and beta-glucosidase, and plasma triglyceride concentration compared to the HF and HFC treatments (P<0.05). L. acidophilus KFRI342 consumption also decreased the ratio of aberrant crypts to aberrant crypt foci incidence and the number of aberrant crypts in HFCL rats. Therefore, L. acidophilus showed potential probiotic activity as an inhibitor of DMH-induced symptoms in live rats. Our in vivo studies indicate that L. acidophilus from kimchi may be suitable as a probiotic for human use.
TI  - Novel vaginal microflora colonization model providing new insight into microbicide mechanism of action.
AB  - Several broad-spectrum microbicides, including cellulose sulfate (CS), have passed conventional preclinical and phase I clinical safety evaluation and yet have failed to protect women from acquiring HIV-1 in phase II/III trials. Concerns have been raised that current preclinical algorithms are deficient in addressing the complexity of the microflora-regulated vaginal mucosal barrier. We applied a novel microflora-colonized model to evaluate CS and hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC), which is used as a "universal placebo" in microbicide trials. Cervicovaginal epithelial cultures were colonized with normal vaginal microflora isolates representing common Lactobacillus species used as probiotics (L. acidophilus and L. crispatus) or Prevotella bivia and Atopobium vaginae, most prevalent in the disturbed microflora of bacterial vaginosis (BV). At baseline, all strains maintained constant epithelium-associated CFUs without inducing cytotoxicity and apoptosis. CS selectively reduced epithelium-associated CFUs and (to a lesser extent) planktonic CFUs, most significantly affecting L. crispatus. Inducing only minor changes in sterile epithelial cultures, CS induced expression of innate immunity mediators (RANTES, interleukin-8 [IL-8], and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor [SLPI]) in microflora-colonized epithelia, most significantly potentiating effects of bacteria causing BV. In the absence of CS, all bacterial strains except L. acidophilus activated NF-kappaB, although IL-8 and RANTES levels were increased by the presence of BV-causing bacteria only. CS enhanced NF-kappaB activation in a dose-dependent manner under all conditions, including L. acidophilus colonization. HEC remained inert. These results offer insights into possible mechanisms of CS clinical failure. The bacterially colonized cervicovaginal model reveals unique aspects of microflora-epithelium-drug interactions and innate immunity in the female genital tract and should become an integral part of preclinical safety evaluation of anti-HIV microbicides and other vaginal formulations. IMPORTANCE: This report provides experimental evidence supporting the concept that the vaginal microflora regulates the epithelial innate immunity in a species- and strain-specific manner and that topically applied microbicides may alter both the bacterial and epithelial components of this homeostatic interaction. Our data also highlight the importance of differentiating the effects of biomedical interventions on epithelium-associated versus conventional planktonic bacterial growth when assessing vaginal mucosal health and immunity.
TI  - Evaluation of chitoligosaccharides effect upon probiotic bacteria.
AB  - The main objective of the present study was to evaluate the antibacterial effect  - through the determination of minimum inhibitory (and lethal) concentrations, as well as the possible prebiotic potential of chitooligosaccharides (COS) - through the determination of growth curves, on Bifidobacterium animalis Bb12, Bifidobacterium animalis Bo and Lactobacillus acidophilus Ki. Atomic force microscopy was further used to obtain high resolution images of COS effects upon the cell morphology. Our results demonstrate that COS do not stimulate the growth of those strains, neither the strains are capable of using COS as a primary source of carbon. Analysis of morphology when exposed to inhibitory/bactericidal concentrations, suggested that COS do not exert any direct damage upon the bacteria structure, instead the bacteria are apparently covered by COS, which likely prevent nutrient uptake.
TI  - Savings from the use of a probiotic formula in the prophylaxis of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) and particularly Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) are the most common causes of healthcare associated infectious diarrhea. A double-blind, dose response, placebo-controlled trial of the probiotic formula (Bio-K+ Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285 and Lactobacillus casei LBC80R formula) for prophylaxis of AAD and CDAD was published in 2010. The Bio-K+ Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285 and Lactobacillus casei LBC80R formula is a registered trademark of Bio-K Plus International Inc. (Laval, Quebec, Canada). Results indicated that the incidence of AAD and CDAD were lower for patients assigned to the probiotic formula compared with the placebo option. The present study aims to estimate the savings in direct medical costs that might result from the use of two different doses of the probiotic formula vs placebo. METHODS: A cost-consequence analysis was conducted to compare the two doses of the probiotic formula compared to placebo. The analysis was based upon published data and adjusted to the North American context. RESULTS: Economic analyses showed that the use of the probiotic formula would result in estimated mean per patients savings of US$1968 for the single dose and US$2661 for the double dose compared with the placebo option if used an average of 13 days by all patients at risk of developing AAD and CDAD. LIMITATIONS: Several key parameters considered within the economic model were not captured within the Gao et al. study. Numerous sensitivity analyses were conducted to address this issue. CONCLUSION: The use of the probiotic formula in prophylaxis of AAD and CDAD would lead to estimated savings in direct medical costs that would substantially offset its acquisition cost. Treating 1000 hospitalized patients on antibiotics with the double dose of the product compared to current practice would save a single payer system the sum of $2,661,218.

TI  - D-Fagomine lowers postprandial blood glucose and modulates bacterial adhesion.
AB  - D-Fagomine is an iminosugar originally isolated from seeds of buckwheat (Fagopyrum sculentum Moench), present in the human diet and now available as a pure crystalline product. We tested D-fagomine for activities connected to a reduction in the risk of developing insulin resistance, becoming overweight and suffering from an excess of potentially pathogenic bacteria. The activities were: intestinal sucrase inhibition in vitro (rat mucosa and everted intestine sleeves), modulation of postprandial blood glucose in rats, bacterial agglutination and bacterial adhesion to pig intestinal mucosa. When ingested together with sucrose or starch, D-fagomine lowered blood glucose in a dose-dependent manner without stimulating insulin secretion. D-Fagomine reduced the area under the curve (0-120 min) by 20 % (P < 0.01) and shifted the time to maximum blood glucose concentration (Tmax) by 15 min at doses of 1-2 mg/kg body weight when administered together with 1 g sucrose/kg body weight. Moreover, D-fagomine (0.14 mm) agglutinated 60 % of Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium) populations (P < 0.01), while it did not show this effect on Bifidobacterium spp. or Lactobacillus spp. At the same concentration, d-fagomine significantly (P < 0.001) inhibited the adhesion of Enterobacteriaceae (95-99 % cells in the supernatant) and promoted the adhesion of Lactobacillus acidophilus (56 % cells in the supernatant) to intestinal mucosa. D-Fagomine did not show any effect on bacterial cell viability. Based on all this evidence, D-fagomine may be used as a dietary ingredient or functional food component to reduce the health risks associated with an excessive intake of fast-digestible carbohydrates, or an excess of potentially pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - [Relation between dysbacteriosis of Helicobacter pylori and Lactobacillus acidophilus and the pathogenesis of chronic gastropathy patients of Pi-Wei damp-heat syndrome].
AB  - Pi-Wei theory is an important component of the basic theory of Chinese medicine.  The pathogenesis of Pi-Wei damp-heat syndrome is an important content of Pi-Wei theory. The tongue coating is one of the most important signs reflecting Pi-Wei damp-heat syndrome. From the perspective of microecology and pathogenesis, the microbial disequilibrium caused by quantity changes of Helicobacter pylori (Hp) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) and their interaction in the gastric mucosa and the tongue coating might have certain correlation with "mutual struggle between the evil and the vital qi, the disequilibrium between yin and yang". The pathogenesis features of chronic gastritis patients of Pi-Wei damp-heat syndrome was initially proposed in this article.
TI  - In vitro assessment of photocatalytic titanium oxide surface modified stainless steel orthodontic brackets for antiadherent and antibacterial properties against Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the antiadherent and antibacterial properties of surface modified stainless steel orthodontic brackets with photocatalytic titanium oxide (TiO(2)) against Lactobacillus acidophilus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was done on 120 specimens of stainless steel preadjusted edgewise appliance (PEA) orthodontic brackets. The specimens were divided into four test groups. Each group consisted of 30 specimens. Groups containing uncoated brackets acted as a control group for their respective experimental group containing coated brackets. Surface modification of brackets was carried out by the radiofrequency (RF) magnetron sputtering method with photocatalytic TiO(2). Brackets then were subjected to microbiological tests for assessment of the antiadherent and antibacterial properties of photocatalytic TiO(2) coating against L acidophilus. RESULTS: Orthodontic brackets coated with photocatalytic TiO(2) showed an antiadherent effect against L acidophilus compared with uncoated brackets. The bacterial mass that was bound to the TiO(2)-coated brackets was less when compared with the uncoated brackets. Furthermore, TiO(2)-coated brackets had a bactericidal effect on L acidophilus, which causes dental caries. CONCLUSION: Surface modification of orthodontic brackets with photocatalytic TiO(2) can be used to prevent the accumulation of dental plaque and the development of dental caries during orthodontic treatment.
TI  - Transcriptional and functional analysis of galactooligosaccharide uptake by lacS  in Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Probiotic microbes rely on their ability to survive in the gastrointestinal tract, adhere to mucosal surfaces, and metabolize available energy sources from dietary compounds, including prebiotics. Genome sequencing projects have proposed models for understanding prebiotic catabolism, but mechanisms remain to be elucidated for many prebiotic substrates. Although beta-galactooligosaccharides (GOS) are documented prebiotic compounds, little is known about their utilization by lactobacilli. This study aimed to identify genetic loci in Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM responsible for the transport and catabolism of GOS. Whole-genome oligonucleotide microarrays were used to survey the differential global transcriptome during logarithmic growth of L. acidophilus NCFM using GOS or glucose as a sole source of carbohydrate. Within the 16.6-kbp gal-lac gene cluster, lacS, a galactoside-pentose-hexuronide permease-encoding gene, was up-regulated 5.1-fold in the presence of GOS. In addition, two beta-galactosidases, LacA and LacLM, and enzymes in the Leloir pathway were also encoded by genes within this locus and up-regulated by GOS stimulation. Generation of a lacS-deficient mutant enabled phenotypic confirmation of the functional LacS permease not only for the utilization of lactose and GOS but also lactitol, suggesting a prominent role of LacS in the metabolism of a broad range of prebiotic beta-galactosides, known to selectively modulate the beneficial gut microbiota.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal activities of punica granatum peel extracts against  oral pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Punica granatum has been used for many years in folk medicine due to several purposes. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of methanolic extract of Punica granatum peel (MEPGP) against Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguinis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Actynomyces viscosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Candida albicans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this in vitro study, the mentioned oral organisms were cultured in blood agar and mueller-hinton media and then paper disks containing MEPGP at concentrations of 4 mg/ml, 8 mg/ml and 12 mg/ml were inserted on medias. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated by agar disk diffusion method. The effects of three different concentrations of MEPGP against microorganisms were compared using one-way ANOVA and Tukey tests. RESULTS: All concentrations of MEPGP had antibacterial activity against S. aureus and S. epidermidis. Only at concentration of 8 mg/ml and 12 mg/ml MEPGP was effective against L. acidophilus, S. mutans and S. salivarius. Furthermore; no concentrations of MEPGP inhibited A. viscosus and C. albicans. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that MEPGP might be used as an antibacterial agent in controlling oral infections.
TI  - Dental health of 6-year-old children in Alpes Maritimes, France.
AB  - AIM: To describe the dental health status of 6-year-old children using the ICDAS-II advanced method and to evaluate the association between the known caries risk factors with the cavitated caries lesion (WHO basic method) or with both non-cavitated and cavitated caries lesion caries (ICDAS II). METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a questionnaire was used to evaluate oral health and dietary habits of children. A clinical examination and a Cario analysis test (Pierre Fabre Oral care) were performed. STATISTICS: Logistic regression analyses were used to assess the association between caries and daily tooth-brushing, dietary habits, visible plaque and salivary factors. RESULTS: There were 341 children (52% female and 6.25+/-0.46 years of age) in this study. Using the ICDAS-II advanced method, 39% of the children were caries-free. This proportion was larger (67.2%) using the WHO method. In multivariate models, visible dental plaque and Streptococcus mutans count were associated with caries experience registered as ICDAS-II codes 1-6 or codes 3-6. The absence of daily tooth-brushing with fluoridated toothpaste was associated only with caries experience ICDAS-II codes 3-6. CONCLUSION: The use of WHO or ICDAS-II method changed the proportion of caries-free children but not the clinical caries risk factors associated with caries experience.
TI  - Oral inoculation of probiotics Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM suppresses tumour growth both in segmental orthotopic colon cancer and extra-intestinal tissue.
AB  - Modulation of the cellular response by the administration of probiotic bacteria may be an effective strategy for preventing or inhibiting tumour growth. We orally pre-inoculated mice with probiotics Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM (La) for 14 d. Subcutaneous dorsal-flank tumours and segmental orthotopic colon cancers were implanted into mice using CT-26 murine colon adenocarcinoma cells. On day 28 after tumour initiation, the lamina propria of the colon, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and spleen were harvested and purified for flow cytometry and mRNA analyses. We demonstrated that La pre-inoculation reduced tumour volume growth by 50.3 %, compared with untreated mice at 28 d after tumour implants (2465.5 (SEM 1290.4) v. 4950.9 (SEM 1689.3) mm(3), P<0.001). Inoculation with La reduced the severity of colonic carcinogenesis caused by CT-26 cells, such as level of colonic involvement and structural abnormality of epithelial/crypt damage. Moreover, La enhanced apoptosis of CT-26 cells both in dorsal-flank tumour and segmental orthotopic colon cancer, and the mean counts of apoptotic body were higher in mice pre-inoculated with La (P<0.05) compared with untreated mice. La pre-inoculation down-regulated the CXCR4 mRNA expressions in the colon, MLN and extra-intestinal tissue, compared with untreated mice (P<0.05). In addition, La pre-inoculation reduced the mean fluorescence index of MHC class I (H-2Dd, -Kd and -Ld) in flow cytometry analysis. Taken together, these findings suggest that probiotics La may play a role in attenuating tumour growth during CT-26 cell carcinogenesis. The down-regulated expression of CXCR4 mRNA and MHC class I, as well as increasing apoptosis in tumour tissue, indicated that La may be associated with modulating the cellular response triggered by colon carcinogenesis.
TI  - Probiotics for prevention and treatment of diarrhea.
AB  - Probiotics have been extensively studied over the past several years in the prevention and, to a larger extent, in the treatment of diarrheal diseases, especially in pediatric populations. Diarrhea is a symptom, and not a disease. This review will not address chronic disorders associated with diarrhea, or Clostridium difficile-induced diarrhea. Rather it will focus on published clinical trials performed on acute-onset, likely infectious diarrhea occurring in the settings of day-care centers, in the community, acquired in the hospital, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and treatment of acute infectious diarrhea. For prevention of diarrhea acquired in day-care centers, 9 randomized and placebo-controlled trials have been published, conducted in different parts of the world. Probiotics tested were Lactobacillus GG, Bifidobacterium lactis (alone or in combination with Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus (not GG), and Lactobacillus acidophilus, in various trials either alone or in comparison with each other. The evidence of their efficacy in these settings is only modest for the prevention of diarrhea, although somewhat better for prevention of upper respiratory infections. In the community, new trails conducted in underprivileged areas of India, again with modest efficacy. Previous trials that examined the potential role of probiotics in preventing the spreading of diarrhea in hospitalized children had yielded conflicting results. More recently, a large trial in Poland showed, however, rather good evidence of efficacy for Lactobacillus GG. The prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea has been the subject of many investigations, both in children and in adults. Most commonly used probiotics were Lactobacillus GG, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Bifidobacterium ssp, Streptococcus ssp, and the yeast Saccharomyces boulardii. In general, most of these trials do show clear evidence of efficacy, with the 2 most effective strains being Lactobacillus GG and S. boulardii. Evidence is also emerging on the importance of the dose in reducing the incidence of this type of diarrhea, and the incidence of Clostridium difficile-associated postantibiotic diarrhea. As for treatment, a large body of data is available, especially in children, on the effect of several strains of probiotics in treating sporadic infectious diarrhea. The vast majority of the published trials show a statistically significant benefit and moderate clinical benefit of a few, well-identified probiotic strains-mostly Lactobacillus GG and S. boulardii-in the treatment of acute watery diarrhea, and particularly those due to rotavirus. Such a beneficial effect results, on average, in a reduction of diarrhea duration of approximately 1 day. The effect is strain-dependent and dose-dependent.
TI  - Probiotics in the prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis.
AB  - Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a common gastrointestinal inflammatory necrosis affecting almost exclusively premature infants usually after oral nutrition has been started, for example, 10 day plus postpartum. Although the pathogenesis is incompletely understood, major risk factors include prematurity and incomplete bacterial colonization. Evidence has been shown that the premature infant because of rapid passage through the birth canal or because of delivery by cesarean section has an inadequate initial ingestion of maternal colonic and vaginal flora and therefore, an inadequate initial colonization with less diversity of bacteria phylla and fewer species of bacteria in the microbiota. As a result, they are more susceptible to environmental pathogens. In addition, prematures have immature intestinal defenses (glycocalyx, tight junctions, innate immune response, etc.) resulting in excessive inflammation in response to luminal stimuli. Recently, we reported that genes mediating the innate inflammatory immune response are developmentally expressed with an increase in toll-like receptors, signaling molecules and transgenic factors and decreased negative regulators of inflammation, which undoubtedly contribute to an excessive inflammatory response. Several clinical studies have suggested that the use of probiotics and ingestion of expressed maternal breast milk containing probiotics can help to stabilize colonization and to reduce the incidence and severity of NEC when given to premature infants at risk. Meta-analyses of multiple small studies strongly suggest a protective effect in the use of probiotics. A multicenter study in Taiwan suggests that Bifidobacteria infantis and Lactobacillus acidophilus in combination may prevent NEC. These meta-analyses suggest that these probiotics should be used in routine care of premature infants. Other clinicians, however, suggest caution, holding out for a single protocol multicenter trial before routine use can be suggested.
TI  - Murine models of vaginal trichomonad infections.
AB  - Trichomonas vaginalis and Tritrichomonas foetus cause common sexually transmitted infections in humans and cattle, respectively. Mouse models of trichomoniasis are important for pathogenic and therapeutic studies. Here, we compared murine genital infections with T. vaginalis and T. foetus. Persistent vaginal infection with T. foetus was established with 100 parasites but T. vaginalis infection required doses of 10(6), perhaps because of greater susceptibility to killing by mouse vaginal polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Infection with T. vaginalis persisted longest after combined treatment of mice with estrogen and dexamethasone, whereas infection was only short-lived when mice were given estrogen or dexamethasone alone, co-infected with Lactobacillus acidophilus, and/or pretreated with antibiotics. Infection rates were similar with metronidazole-resistant (MR) and metronidazole-sensitive (MS) T. vaginalis. High dose but not low dose metronidazole treatment controlled infection with MS better than MR T. vaginalis. These murine models will be valuable for investigating the pathogenesis and treatment of trichomoniasis.
TI  - The alteration of components in the fermented Hwangryunhaedok-tang and its neuroprotective activity.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hwangryunhaedok-tang is a traditional herbal prescription that has sedative activity, hypotensive and anti-bacterial effects. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated the alteration of contents of components in Hwangryunhaedok-tang, antioxidant activity and neuroprotective activity by fermentation with Lactobacillus acidophilus KFRI 128. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Contents of three marker compounds (geniposide, berberine and palmatine) and unknown compounds in the Hwangryunhaedok-tang (HR) and the fermented Hwangryunhaedok-tang (FHR) were measured and compared using the established high-performance liqued chromatograph coupled with a photodiode (HPLC-DAD) method. The antioxidant activity of HR and FHR were determined by DPPH free radical and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) scavenging assay. Also, the neuroprotective activities of HR and FHR against glutamate-induced oxidative stress in a mouse hippocampal cell line (HT22) were evaluated by MTT assay. RESULTS: The contents of geniposide and palmatine were decreased but the content of berberine was increased in the FHR. And the contents of unknown compounds (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) in the HR were altered by fermentation. Electron donating activity (EDA, %) value of FHR was higher than HR for DPPH radical scavenging activity and H2O2 scavenging activity, respectively. In the MTT assay, FHR showed more potent neuroprotective activity than HR by 513.90%. CONCLUSION: The FHR using microorganism could convert compounds in HR and enhance the antioxidant and neuroprotective activity.
TI  - A novel biosensor based on Lactobacillus acidophilus for determination of phenolic compounds in milk products and wastewater.
AB  - Different branches of industry need to use phenolic compounds (PCs) in their production, so determination of PCs sensitively, accurately, rapidly, and economically is very important. For the sensitive determination of PCs, some biosensors based on pure polyphenol oxidase, plant tissue and microorganisms were developed before. But there has been no study to develop a microbial phenolic compounds biosensor based on Lactobacillus species, which contain polyphenol oxidase enzyme. In this study, we used different forms of Lactobacillus species as enzyme sources of biosensor and compared biosensor performances of these forms for determination of PCs. For this purpose, we used lyophilized Lactobacillus cells (containing L. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, Streptococcus thermophilus), pure L. acidophilus, pure L. bulgaricus, and L. acidophilus- and L. bulgaricus adapted to catechol in Lactobacilli MRS Broth. The most suitable form was determined and optimization studies of the biosensor were carried out by using this form. For preparing the bioactive layer of the biosensor, the Lactobacillus cells were immobilized in gelatin by using glutaraldehyde. In the study, we used catechol as a substrate. Phenolic compound determination is based on the assay of the differences on the respiration activity of the cells on the oxygen meter in the absence and the presence of catechol. The microbial biosensor response depends directly on catechol concentration between 0.5 and 5.0 mM with 18 min response time. In the optimization studies of the microbial biosensor the most suitable microorganism amount was found to be 10 mg, and also phosphate buffer (pH 8.0; 50 mM) and 37.5 degrees C were obtained as the optimum working conditions. In the characterization studies of the microbial biosensor some parameters such as substrate specificity on the biosensor response and operational and storage stability were examine. Furthermore, the determination of PC levels in synthetic wastewater, industrial wastewater, and milk products was investigated by using the developed biosensor under optimum conditions.
TI  - The effect of probiotics on faecal microbiota and genotoxic activity of faecal water in patients with atopic dermatitis: a randomized, placebo-controlled study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Colonic microbiota is involved in the etiology of colon cancer according to several reports. Studies also indicate that the microbiota differs between atopic patients and healthy subjects. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether a probiotic mix containing Lactobacillus paracasei Lpc-37, Lactobacillus acidophilus 74-2, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis DGCC 420 can affect the microbiota and its genotoxic activity in healthy subjects and patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). METHODS: A placebo-controlled cross-over study was conducted. Fifteen healthy adults and 15 adult AD patients consumed 2x100 ml/d of either a probiotic or a placebo drink for 8 weeks followed by a wash out period of 2 weeks before crossing the intervention. Faecal water was isolated from stool samples collected at the end of each period. HT29c19a cells incubated with faecal water were measured for DNA damage using single-cell gel electrophoresis ("comet assay"). Bacterial species were determined by qPCR and concentrations of short-chain fatty acids were measured by means of gas chromatography. RESULTS: Probiotic supplementation resulted in a significant increase in lactobacilli, whereas numbers of Bifidobacteria and Bacteroidetes remained unchanged. Clostridium perfringens cluster I-II was significantly reduced in healthy subjects. Genotoxic potential (expressed as tail intensity) of faecal water, was not affected. However, tail intensity decreased significantly in the probiotic period compared to placebo (23.5 vs. 16.7%) in AD patients. Although faecal concentrations of short-chain fatty acids were not affected, faecal pH was significantly reduced (7.0 vs. 6.6) in AD patients after probiotics. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that probiotics lower the genotoxic potential of faecal water in AD patients. The faecal C. perfringens cluster I-II levels remained unaffected suggesting either a change in their activity, or the fact that other bacterial species are responsible for the reduced genotoxic activity of faecal water.
TI  - Vaginal microbiota of healthy pregnant Mexican women is constituted by four Lactobacillus species and several vaginosis-associated bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the microbiota communities in the vaginal tracts of healthy Mexican women across the pregnancy. METHODS: Vaginal swabs were obtained during the prenatal visit of women from all trimesters (n = 64) of healthy pregnant women of Mexico City. DNA was isolated from each sample, and PCR-DGGE and sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments were used to identify the bacterial communities. RESULTS: 21 different microorganisms were identified in the vaginal samples. Lactobacillus genus was present in 98% of women studied. Four lactobacilli species were identified in vaginal samples. L. acidophilus was the predominant (78%) followed by L. iners (54%), L. gasseri (20%), and L. delbrueckii (6%). 17 different microorganisms related to bacterial vaginosis conditions were identified. Ureaplasma urealyticum was the predominant (21%) followed by BVAB1 (17%) and Gemella bergeriae (7.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Lactobacillus genus predominates in the vaginal samples of Mexican pregnant women associated with different microorganisms related to bacterial vaginosis conditions.
TI  - Establishment of tolerance to commensal bacteria requires a complex microbiota and is accompanied by decreased intestinal chemokine expression.
AB  - Intricate regulation of tolerance to the intestinal commensal microbiota acquired at birth is critical. We hypothesized that epithelial cell tolerance toward early gram-positive and gram-negative colonizing bacteria is established immediately after birth, as has previously been shown for endotoxin. Gene expression in the intestine of mouse pups born to dams that were either colonized with a conventional microbiota or monocolonized (Lactobacillus acidophilus or Eschericia coli) or germ free was examined on day 1 and day 6 after birth. Intestinal epithelial cells from all groups of pups were stimulated ex vivo with L. acidophilus and E. coli to assess tolerance establishment. Intestine from pups exposed to a conventional microbiota displayed lower expression of Ccl2, Ccl3, Cxcl1, Cxcl2, and Tslp than germ-free mice, whereas genes encoding proteins in Toll-like receptor signaling pathways and cytokines were upregulated. When comparing pups on day 1 and day 6 after birth, a specific change in gene expression pattern was evident in all groups of mice. Tolerance to ex vivo stimulation with E. coli was only established in conventional animals. Colonization of the intestine was reflected in the spleen displaying downregulation of Cxcl2 compared with germ-free animals on day 1 after birth. Colonization reduced the expression of genes involved in antigen presentation in the intestine-draining mesenteric lymph nodes, but not in the popliteal lymph nodes, as evidenced by gene expression on day 23 after birth. We propose that microbial detection systems in the intestine are upregulated by colonization with a diverse microbiota, whereas expression of proinflammatory chemokines is reduced to avoid excess recruitment of immune cells to the maturing intestine.
TI  - Enhanced survival of probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus by encapsulation with nanostructured polyelectrolyte layers through layer-by-layer approach.
AB  - The encapsulation of probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus through layer-by-layer self-assembly of polyelectrolytes (PE) chitosan (CHI) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) has been investigated to enhance its survival in adverse conditions encountered in the GI tract. The survival of encapsulated cells in simulated gastric (SGF) and intestinal fluids (SIF) is significant when compared to nonencapsulated cells. On sequential exposure to SGF and SIF for 120 min, almost complete death of free cells is observed. However, for cells coated with three nanolayers of PEs (CHI/CMC/CHI), about 33 log % of the cells (6 log cfu/500 mg) survived under the same conditions. The enhanced survival rate of encapsulated L. acidophilus can be attributed to the impermeability of polyelectrolyte nanolayers to large enzyme molecules like pepsin and pancreatin that cause proteolysis and to the stability of the polyelectrolyte nanolayers in gastric and intestinal pH. The PE coating also serves to reduce viability losses during freezing and freeze-drying. About 73 and 92 log % of uncoated and coated cells survived after freeze-drying, and the losses occurring between freezing and freeze-drying were found to be lower for the coated cells.
TI  - The hsp 16 gene of the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus is differently regulated by salt, high temperature and acidic stresses, as revealed by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis.
AB  - Small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are ubiquitous conserved chaperone-like proteins involved in cellular proteins protection under stressful conditions. In this study, a reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) procedure was developed and used to quantify the transcript level of a small heat shock gene (shs) in the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM, under stress conditions such as heat (45 degrees C and 53 degrees C), bile (0.3% w/v), hyperosmosis (1 M and 2.5 M NaCl), and low pH value (pH 4). The shs gene of L. acidophilus NCFM was induced by salt, high temperature and acidic stress, while repression was observed upon bile stress. Analysis of the 5' noncoding region of the hsp16 gene reveals the presence of an inverted repeat (IR) sequence (TTAGCACTC-N9-GAGTGCTAA) homologue to the controlling IR of chaperone expression (CIRCE) elements found in the upstream regulatory region of Gram-positive heat shock operons, suggesting that the hsp16 gene of L. acidophilus might be transcriptionally controlled by HrcA. In addition, the alignment of several small heat shock proteins identified so far in lactic acid bacteria, reveals that the Hsp16 of L. acidophilus exhibits a strong evolutionary relationship with members of the Lactobacillus acidophilus group.
TI  - Effect of the inoculation level of Lactobacillus acidophilus in probiotic cheese  on the physicochemical features and sensory performance compared with commercial cheeses.
AB  - The complex metabolism of probiotic bacteria requires several technological options to guarantee the functionally of probiotic dairy foods during the shelf life. This research aimed to evaluate the effect of the supplementation of increasing amounts of Lactobacillus acidophilus (0, 0.4, or 0.8 g/L of milk) on the physicochemical parameters and sensory acceptance of Minas fresh cheese. In addition, the sensory acceptance of probiotic cheeses was assessed using a consumer test and compared with commercial cheeses (conventional and probiotic). High counts (9.11 to 9.42 log cfu/g) of L. acidophilus were observed throughout the shelf life, which contributed to the maintenance of its probiotic status and resulted in lower pH values and greater production of organic acids. The probiotic cheeses presented lower scores for appearance, aroma, and texture compared with conventional cheeses. Internal preference mapping explained almost 60% of the total variation of the data and showed a large number of consumers concentrated near the conventional cheeses, demonstrating greater preference for these samples. The findings indicated that some negative sensory effects could occur when high level of supplementation with L. acidophilus is used in probiotic cheese processing.
TI  - N,N'-Dithiobisphthalimide, a disulfide aromatic compound, is a potent spermicide  agent in humans.
AB  - Several studies have shown that users of vaginal preparations containing nonoxynol-9 (N-9) are at a high risk for sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV. Therefore, there is a great interest in identifying compounds that can specifically inhibit sperm without damaging the vaginal lining, possess a powerful spermicide activity, and can be used in contraceptive vaginal preparations to replace N-9. In this work, we studied the spermostatic and/or spermicidal activity of five non-detergent, disulfide compounds on human sperm, HeLa cells, and Lactobacillus acidophilus. The motility and viability of human sperm in semen and culture medium was evaluated after treatment with different concentrations of the disulfide compounds (2.5 - 100 microM). In addition, we evaluated the cytotoxic effect on HeLa cells and L. acidophilus. We identified compound 101, N,N'-dithiobisphthalimide (No. CAS 7764-30-9), as the most effective molecule. It has a half maximal effective concentration (EC(50)) of 8 microM and a minimum effective concentration (defined as the concentration that immobilizes 100 percent of the sperm in 20 sec) of 24 microM. At these concentrations, compound 101 does not affect the viability of the sperm, HeLa cells, or L. acidophilus. Our results indicate that dithiobisphthalimide has a potent spermostatic, irreversible effect with no toxic effects on HeLa cells and L. acidophilus.
TI  - Effects of daily consumption of probiotic yoghurt on inflammatory factors in pregnant women: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - Previous studies have shown that inflammatory factors increases in pregnancy and  is associated with several complications of pregnancy. The aim of this study was to assess effects of daily consumption of probiotic yoghurt on inflammatory factors in pregnant women. In a randomized clinical trial, seventy primigravid (the first pregnancy) and singleton pregnant women aged 18-30 years were assigned to two groups. Subjects consumed daily 200 g probiotic yoghurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 and Bifidobacterium animalis BB12 (10(7) CFU g(-1) for each) or 200 g conventional yoghurt for 9 weeks. Fasting blood samples were collected at baseline (28 weeks of gestation) and after intervention (37 weeks of gestation). Inflammatory factors, hs-CRP and TNF-alpha, were measured by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Independent t-test was used to compare the two groups after intervention and paired-sample t-test compared variables before and after treatment. The results showed that the probiotic yogurt brought about a decrease in the serum hs-CRP level, from 10.44 +/- 1.56 to 7.44 +/- 1.03 microg mL(-1) (p = 0.041). There was no significant change in the conventional yogurt group in the serum hs-CRP level (12.55 +/- 1.57 to 14.51 +/- 1.62 microg mL(-1), p = 0.202). The probiotic yogurt had no effect on TNF-alpha (from 73.75 +/- 6.59 to 77.91 +/- 5.61 pg mL(-1), p = 0.633). Serum TNF-alpha did not change in the conventional yogurt group (p = 0.134). In conclusion probiotic yogurt significantly decreased hs-CRP in pregnant women but had no effect on TNF-alpha.
TI  - [Antagonistic effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium adolescents on periodontalpathogens in vitro].
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the possible antagonistic effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus (La) and Bifidobacterium adolescents (Ba) on Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) and Fusobacteriurn nuclearum (Fn). METHODS: Cylinder plate method was used to observe the inhibition zone formation.The suspensions of periodontal pathogens were mixed with cell free solutions of probiotics respectively, to investigate the antagonistic effect on the production of probiotics. The data were analyzed by ANOVA using SAS 9.0 software package. RESULTS: La only inhibited the growth of Pg. The cell free extract of La also significantly inhibited the growth of Pg (P<0.001). There was no antagonistic effect of Ba on the two periodontal pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: La strongly inhibits the growth of Pg by its metabolites. The new strategy of confining periodontal pathogens with La as ecological modulator is worthy of further study.
TI  - Utilization of UF-permeate for production of beta-galactosidase by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Four lactobacilli strains (Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacilus casei and Lactobacillus reuteri) were grown in MRS broth and three lactococci strains (Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. Lactis and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar. diacetilactis) were grown in M17 broth. L. reuteri and S. thermophilus were chosen on the basis of the best mean beta-galactosidase activity of 10.44 and 10.01 U/ml respectively, for further studies on permeate-based medium. The maximum production of beta-galactosidase by L. reuteri was achieved at lactose concentration of 6%, initial pH 5.0-7.5, ammonium phosphate as nitrogen source at a concentration of 0.66 g N/L and incubation temperature at 30 degrees C/24 hrs to give 6.31 U/ml. While in case of S. thermophilus, maximum beta-galactosidase production was achieved at 10% lactose concentration of permeate medium, supplemented with phosphate buffer ratio of 0.5:0.5 (KH2PO4:K2HPO4, g/L), at initial pH 6.0-6.5, ammonium phosphate (0.66g N/L) as nitrogen source and incubation temperature 35 degrees C for 24 hrs to give 7.85 U/ml.
TI  - Randomised clinical trial: the synbiotic food supplement Probiotical vs. placebo  for acute gastroenteritis in children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some probiotic strains reduce the duration of acute diarrhoea. As a result of strain and product specificity, each product needs support by clinical data. AIM: In children with acute diarrhoea, to test the efficacy of the synbiotic food supplement Probiotical (Streptoccoccus thermophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium lactis, Bifidobacterium infantis, fructo-oligosaccharides). The primary end-points were duration of diarrhoea and the number of children that had a normalised stool consistency. METHOD: A total of 111 children with acute diarrhoea (median age 40 months) were included in this randomised, prospective placebo-controlled parallel clinical trial in primary health care. All children were treated with oral rehydration solution ad libitum and with the synbiotic (n=57) or placebo (n = 54). RESULTS: The median duration of diarrhoea was 3 days (IQ 25-75: 2-4 days) in the Probiotical group, compared with 4 days (IQ 25-75: 4-5 days) in the placebo group (P<0.005). The number of children with normal stool consistency (defined as stool Bristol score </=4) was higher in the synbiotic group on days 2 and 3 [21 vs. 2% (P<0.001) and 50 vs. 24% (P<0.001) respectively]. Less additional medication (antipyretics, antiemetics, antibiotics) was administered in the synbiotic group. Physicians were globally more satisfied with the synbiotic food supplement treatment than with placebo (P=0.005). One patient in the placebo group was hospitalised. CONCLUSION: The median duration of diarrhoea was significantly 1 day shorter in the synbiotic than in the placebo group, associated with decreased prescription of additional medications.
TI  - Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria induce differential interferon-beta profiles in dendritic cells.
AB  - The health promoting effects of probiotics are well-documented; however, current  knowledge on immunostimulatory effects is based on data from a single strain or a limited selection of strains or species. Here, we compared the capacity of 27 lactobacilli and 16 bifidobacteria strains to stimulate bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DC). Most lactobacilli strains, including Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus plantarum, induced strong IL-12 and TNF-alpha production and up-regulation of maturation markers. In contrast, all bifidobacteria and certain lactobacilli strains were low IL-12 and TNF-alpha inducers. IL-10 and IL-6 levels showed less variation and no correlation with IL-12 and TNF-alpha. DC matured by strong IL-12-inducing strains also produced high levels of interferon (IFN)-beta. When combining two strains, low IL-12 inducers inhibited this IFN-beta production as well as IL-12 and Th1-skewing chemokines. The IFN-beta induction was mediated through c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) irrespective of the stimulating strain. The inhibitory bacteria induced higher levels of the transcription factor c-Jun dimerization protein (JDP)-2, thereby counteracting the effect of JNK. Our data demonstrate that lactobacilli can be divided into two groups of bacteria featuring contrasting effects, while all bifidobacteria exhibit uniform effects. This underlines the importance of selecting the proper strain(s) for probiotic purposes.
TI  - Macrolide resistance and in vitro selection of resistance to antibiotics in Lactobacillus isolates.
AB  - Spreading of resistance to antibiotics is of great concern due to the increasing  rate of isolation of multiresistant pathogens. Since commensal bacteria may transfer determinants of resistance to pathogens, studies on development of resistance should include also lactobacilli. Resistance to macrolides, penicillins and tetracycline was determined in 40 isolates of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus crispatus, and Lactobacillus casei isolated from faeces of apparently healthy volunteers. Frequency of mutation and changes in susceptibility after serial exposure to these antibiotics at concentrations of 4x and 8x MIC were evaluated in susceptible isolates. Acquired resistance was defined as an increment in MIC values of at least four times in respect to the pre-selection values. Resistance to macrolides and/or tetracycline was identified in 14 and 4 isolates, respectively. ermB gene and A2058G mutation in 23S rRNA were detected in macrolide resistant isolates. Frequencies of mutation of susceptible isolates (n=26) were lower for ampicillin and erythromycin than for tetracycline. Serial exposure to antibiotics led to selection of resistant mutants. However, acquired resistance was rather unstable and was lost after subcultures in antibiotic-free medium in most mutants. Resistance to erythromycin was associated to a A2058G mutation in 23S rRNA. In conclusion, results indicate that resistance to macrolides and tetracycline is present among intestinal lactobacilli. Decrease in susceptibility following serial exposure to antibiotics might occur in lactobacilli, in a strain- and antibiotic-dependent way. Since lactobacilli are often used as probiotics, their ability to acquire resistance should be evaluated for isolates candidate to be included in probiotics based products.
TI  - Effects of penicillin G on morphology and certain physiological parameters of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356.
AB  - Evidence shows that probiotic bacteria can undergo substantial structural and morphological changes in response to environmental stresses, including antibiotics. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of penicillin G (0.015, 0.03, and 0.06 mg/l) on the morphology and adhesion of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356, including the colony morphotype, biofilm production, hydrophobicity, H(2)O(2) formation, S-layer structure, and slpA gene expression. Whereas only smooth colonies grew in the presence of penicillin, rough and smooth colony types were observed in the control group. L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 was found to be hydrophobic under normal conditions, yet its hydrophobicity decreased in the presence of the antibiotic. No biofilm was produced by the bacterium, despite testing a variety of different culture conditions; however, treatment with penicillin G (0.015-0.06 mg/l) significantly decreased its production of H(2)O(2) formation and altered the S-layer protein structure and slpA gene expression. The S-protein expression decreased with 0.015 mg/l penicillin G, yet increased with 0.03 and 0.06 mg/l penicillin G. In addition, the slpA gene expression decreased in the presence of 0.015 mg/l of the antibiotic. In conclusion, penicillin G was able to alter the S-layer protein production, slpA gene expression, and certain physicochemical properties of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356.
TI  - Functional outcome, quality of life, and efficacy of probiotics in postoperative  patients with colorectal cancer.
AB  - PURPOSE: We investigated the functional outcome and health-related quality of life (QOL) of patients who underwent a surgical resection of colorectal cancer, and reviewed the efficacy of probiotics for improving bowel function. METHODS: A questionnaire was mailed to 193 patients. Questionnaires contained the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36-Item Health Survey and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 as QOL scores, the Wexner incontinence score, and original questionnaire items about bowel functions. Probiotics, containing Bacillus natto and Lactobacillus acidophilus, were given to 77 patients for 3 months; after 3 months of treatment, the same questionnaire was administered. The results were analyzed by location of the resected cancer: rectal, colonic, right, and left. RESULTS: In the rectal group, defecation frequency, anal pain, and the Wexner score were significantly worse than in the colonic group. In the right group, the fecal form was looser and nighttime defecation frequency was higher than those of the left group. Three items in the QOL score of the right group were significantly worse compared with the left group. Functional outcome including defecation frequency, feeling of incomplete defecation, and five items in the QOL score were significantly improved after taking probiotics. Improvement in functional outcome and/or QOL was observed in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Not only rectal resection but also rightside colectomy affected bowel dysfunction. Probiotics could be an effective treatment for improvement in functional outcome and QOL after colorectal resection.
TI  - Directed chromosomal integration and expression of the reporter gene gusA3 in Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM is a probiotic microbe that survives passage through the human gastrointestinal tract and interacts with the host epithelium and mucosal immune cells. The potential for L. acidophilus to express antigens at mucosal surfaces has been investigated with various antigens and plasmid expression vectors. Plasmid instability and antibiotic selection complicate the possibility of testing these constructs in human clinical trials. Integrating antigen encoding genes into the chromosome for expression is expected to eliminate selection requirements and provide genetic stability. In this work, a reporter gene encoding a beta-glucuronidase (GusA3) was integrated into four intergenic chromosomal locations. The integrants were tested for genetic stability and GusA3 activity. Two locations were selected for insertion downstream of constitutively highly expressed genes, one downstream of slpA (LBA0169), encoding a highly expressed surface-layer protein, and one downstream of phosphopyruvate hydratase (LBA0889), a highly expressed gene with homologs in other lactic acid bacteria. An inducible location was selected downstream of lacZ (LBA1462), encoding a beta-galactosidase. A fourth location was selected in a low-expression region. The expression of gusA3 was evaluated from each location by measuring GusA3 activity on 4-methyl-umbelliferyl-beta-d-glucuronide (MUG). GusA3 activity from both highly expressed loci was more than three logs higher than the gusA3-negative parent, L. acidophilus NCK1909. GusA3 activity from the lacZ locus was one log higher in cells grown in lactose than in glucose. The differences in expression levels between integration locations highlights the importance of rational targeting with gene cassettes intended for chromosomal expression.
TI  - Probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in a fermented milk product with added  fruit preparation reduce antibiotic associated diarrhea and Helicobacter pylori activity.
AB  - To investigate matrix-specifity of probiotic effects and particularly of the reduction of antibiotics-associated diarrhea, a controlled, randomized, double-blind study was performed, in which 88 Helicobacter pylori-infected but otherwise healthy subjects were given for eight weeks either a) a probiotic fruit yoghurt "mild" containing Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 plus Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12, n = 30), b) the same product but pasteurized after fermentation (n = 29) or c) milk acidified with lactic acid (control, n = 29). During week five, a Helicobacter eradication therapy was performed. Helicobacter activity was measured via 13C-2-urea breath tests and antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal complaints were recorded by validated questionnaires. In intervention group a, b and c the mean number of days with diarrhoea was 4, 10 and 10 (P<0.05), the frequency of episodes 17%, 7% and 27% (n.s.), and the change in total symptoms score before antibiotics treatment was -1.4 +/- 1.1, -1.2 +/- 1.1, 2.6 +/- 1.1 points/four weeks (P<0.05). All milk products decreased Helicobacter activity by 18 to 45% without significant differences between groups. The observed decrease in Hel. pylori activity seems to be not or not only due to probiotic bacteria but (rather) to components of acidified milk (most probably lactic acid). Fruit-yogurt-like fermented milk products with living probiotic bacteria significantly shorten the duration of antibiotics-associated diarrhoea and improve gastrointestinal complaints. Fruit yogurt-like fermented milk is a matrix suitable for probiotic bacteria.
TI  - Age-related decline in macrophage and lymphocyte functions in mice and its alleviation by treatment with probiotic Dahi containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum.
AB  - This study evaluated the effects of probiotic Dahi administration in ageing mice  on macrophage and lymphocyte functions. Probiotic Dahi were prepared by co-culturing in buffalo milk (3% fat) Dahi bacteria (Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris NCDC-86 and Lc. lactis ssp. lactis biovar diacetylactis NCDC-60) along with Lactobacillus acidophilus LaVK2 (La-Dahi) or combined Lb. acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum BbVK3 (LaBb-Dahi). Four groups of 12 mo old mice were fed for four months, with the supplements (5 g/day) of buffalo milk (3% fat), Dahi, La-Dahi and LaBb-Dahi, respectively, in addition to basal diet, and a fifth group that received no supplements served as control. The immune functions of young mice (4 mo old) were also compared with those of ageing adult mice (16 mo old). The production of nitric oxide and cytokines IL-6 and TNF-alpha declined and that of immunosuppressive prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) increased by stimulated peritoneal and splenic macrophages in ageing mice, compared with their young counterparts. The proliferation of stimulated splenocytes diminished and the production of IL-2 decreased and that of IL-6 and TNF-alpha enhanced in ageing compared with young mice. Feeding ageing mice with La-Dahi or LaBb-Dahi improved peritoneal macrophage functions stimulating nitric oxide and IL-6 and diminishing PGE2 production. Feeding La-Dahi or LaBb-Dahi also improved lymphocyte functions stimulating their proliferation and production of IL-2 in ageing mice. To conclude, the probiotic La-Dahi and LaBb-Dahi are effective in reversing age related decline in immune functions in mice.
TI  - Effects of the addition of direct-fed microbials and glycerol to the diet of lactating dairy cows on milk yield and apparent efficiency of yield.
AB  - A study was conducted to evaluate the effects of a direct-fed microbial (M) and dietary glycerol (G) on milk yield, efficiency of yield, and nutrient digestibility during hot weather. Sixty Holstein cows averaging 120 d in milk (DIM) and 36.2 kg/d of milk were used in a 12-wk 2x2 factorial design trial from June through September 2008. Cows were fed a common diet during the 2-wk standardization period and were blocked by milk yield, DIM, parity, and dry matter intake. Diets were based on corn and ryegrass silages and balanced to be isocaloric and isonitrogenous. Treatments included a negative control (M- or G-), 4 x 10(9) cfu/head of a combination of Lactobacillus acidophilus NP51 and Propionibacterium freudenreichii NP24 (M+), control plus 400 g/h per day of 99% pure food-grade glycerol (G+), and 4x10(9) cfu/h per day of a combination of Lactobacillus acidophilus NP51 and Propionibacterium freudenreichii NP24 plus 400 g/h per day of 99% pure food-grade glycerol (MG++). No interactions were observed between direct-fed microbials and dietary glycerol in the study except on apparent nutrient digestibility. No differences were observed in dry matter intake, which averaged 22.7, 23.1, 23.4, and 22.9 for M-, G-, M+, and G+, respectively. Milk yield was increased for M+ compared with M- at 34.1 and 31.7 kg/d, but G+ had no effect on yield. No treatment effect was noted for milk fat percentage or milk protein percentage among diets. Milk protein yield was higher for M+ compared with M- at 0.93 versus 0.87 kg/d. Energy-corrected milk was improved for the M+ versus M- groups at 33.5 and 31.6 kg/d, respectively. No differences in respiratory rate, skin temperature, body temperature, or concentrations of serum glucose or urea N were observed among treatments. Improvement in apparent digestibility was observed with M+ and G+ compared with M-/G- in this experiment. The addition of a direct-fed microbial alone improved milk and protein yield, energy-corrected milk, and apparent digestibility of crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, and acid detergent fiber, and the inclusion of glycerol (G+) had a positive effect on apparent dry matter and acid detergent fiber digestibility compared with M-/G-. The addition of a direct-fed microbial and dietary glycerol may improve yield and digestibility for cows subject to heat stress.
TI  - Gut microbiota of healthy elderly NSAID users is selectively modified with the administration of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and lactitol.
AB  - Ageing changes gut microbiota composition and alters immune system function. Probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics may improve the health status of elderly individuals by modifying the intestinal environment and the microbiota composition, and by stimulating the immune system. In this work, we studied the effects of synbiotic supplementation on the gut microbiota of healthy elderly volunteers. Fifty-one elders were randomly assigned to consume either a synbiotic dietary supplement or a placebo in addition to their usual diet for a 2-week period. The synbiotic product consisted of the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and the prebiotic lactitol and was ingested twice a day, with a total daily dose of 10 g lactitol and 2 x 10(10) cells of probiotic bacteria. Before, during and after the intervention period fecal quantities of six phylogenetic bacterial groups were determined using quantitative PCR, and relative changes in total microbiota composition were assessed by percent guanine-plus-cytosine profiling. The microbiota profiles showed certain relative changes within the microbial community, and indicated an increase of bifidobacteria levels during synbiotic supplementation. Quantification by PCR confirmed the in changes in the microbiota composition; for example increases in total levels of endogenous bifidobacteria and lactobacilli were recorded. Throughout the 6-week study period there was a decrease unrelated to intervention in the Blautia coccoides-Eubacterium rectale bacterial group levels and Clostridium cluster XIVab levels, but this decrease appeared to be halted during the synbiotic intervention. In conclusion, putatively beneficial changes in microbiota were observed in the elderly subjects supplemented with the synbiotic product.
TI  - [The influence assessment of probiotic fermented milk products on intestinal microflora, hematological indices and cellular immunity in rats (report 1)].
AB  - Influence of probiotic fermented milk products on the intestinal flora, hematological parameters and immune status of the experiment in vivo at rats is studied. Entering in digestive tract of probiotic strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus NK-1 and Bifidobacterium bifidum 791 at the level of hundreds of millions CFU in a day (from 1,7 x 10(8) to 9 x 10(8) CFU) in composition fermented milk products renders on the whole positive, but not significant statistically influence on the indexes of colon microflora and immune status of rats, and it must be extended for the achievement of reliable effect.
TI  - Survival of probiotic lactobacilli in the upper gastrointestinal tract using an in vitro gastric model of digestion.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate survival of three commercial probiotic strains (Lactobacillus casei subsp. shirota, L. casei subsp. immunitas, Lactobacillus acidophilus subsp. johnsonii) in the human upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract using a dynamic gastric model (DGM) of digestion followed by incubation under duodenal conditions. Water and milk were used as food matrices and survival was evaluated in both logarithmic and stationary phase. The % of recovery in logarithmic phase ranged from 1.0% to 43.8% in water for all tested strains, and from 80.5% to 197% in milk. Higher survival was observed in stationary phase for all strains. L. acidophilus subsp. johnsonii showed the highest survival rate in both water (93.9%) and milk (202.4%). Lactic acid production was higher in stationary phase, L. casei subsp. shirota producing the highest concentration (98.2 mM) after in vitro gastric plus duodenal digestion.
TI  - Effect of grape polyphenols on lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria growth: resistance and metabolism.
AB  - Food polyphenols are able to selectively modify the growth of susceptible micro-organisms. This study describes the effect of a flavan-3-ol enriched grape seed extract (GSE) on the growth of several lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and bifidobacteria and the ability of the resistant strains to metabolize these compounds. Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus vaginalis strains showed a remarkable sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, including a GSE fraction consisting mainly in (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin (GSE-M). On the other hand, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus bulgaricus strains reached maximal growth with the GSE fractions, including a rich-oligomeric (GSE-O) fraction. Within bifidobacteria, Bifidobacterium lactis BB12 showed the highest sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, whereas Bifidobacterium breve 26M2 and Bifidobacterium bifidum HDD541 reached maximum growth in presence of GSE-O and GSE-M fractions. Metabolism of flavan-3-ols by LAB and bifidobacteria resistant strains was investigated in vitro. The results revealed that only L. plantarum IFPL935 was able to metabolize the polyphenols studied by means of galloyl-esterase, decarboxylase and benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase activities that led to the formation of gallic acid, pyrogallol and catechol, respectively. An unknown metabolite that does not exhibit a phenolic-acid-type structure was also detected, which suggests a new enzyme activity in L. plantarum IFPL935 able to degrade flavan-3-ol monomers.
TI  - The Manitoba Inflammatory Bowel Disease Cohort Study: a prospective longitudinal  evaluation of the use of complementary and alternative medicine services and products.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of complementary and alternative medicine  (CAM) use over time in a population-based cohort of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: The Manitoba IBD Cohort Study is a longitudinal, population-based study of multiple determinants of health outcomes in an IBD cohort. Participants completed semi-annual surveys, and annual in-person interviews. Enquiries about the use of 12 types of CAM service providers and 13 CAM products, based on items from a national survey, were included at months 0, 12, 30 and 54. RESULTS: Overall, 74% of respondents used a CAM service or product in the 4.5-year period, with approximately 40% using some type of CAM at each time point, and 14% using CAM consistently at every time point. There was a trend for women to use CAM more than men; there was no difference in CAM use between patients with Crohn's disease and those with ulcerative colitis. The most often used CAM services (on average) were massage therapy (30%) and chiropractic (14%), physiotherapy (4%), acupuncture (3.5%) and naturopathy/homeopathy (3.5%). A wide range of CAM products were used, with Lactobacillus acidophilus (8%), fish and other oils (5.5%), glucosamine (4%) and chamomile (3.5%) as the most common. On average, only 18% of consumers used CAM for their IBD, so the majority chose it for other problems. There were no differences in psychological variables between CAM users and non-users. CONCLUSIONS: Those with IBD commonly try CAM, although very few use these approaches regularly over the years. CAM is not usually used by patients with IBD for disease management, but clinicians should be aware that many will test the services and products.
TI  - Safety and persistence of orally administered human Lactobacillus sp. strains in  healthy adults.
AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the safety and persistence of selected Lactobacillus strains in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of healthy adult volunteers after oral consumption of high doses of lactobacilli to identify potential candidates for probiotic and biotechnological applications. In the first phase of the study, nine individuals consumed capsules containing Lactobacillus gasseri 177 and E16B7, Lactobacillus acidophilus 821-3, Lactobacillus paracasei 317 and Lactobacillus fermentum 338-1-1 (each daily dose 1x1010 cfu) for 5 consecutive days. Data on gut health, blood parameters, and liver and kidney function were collected. The persistence of Lactobacillus strains was assessed by culturing combined with arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (AP-PCR) and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) on days 0, 5, 8, 10 and 20 from faecal samples. All strains survived gastrointestinal passage and were detected on the 5th day. L. acidophilus 821-3 was detected in four volunteers on the 8th day (4.3 to 7.0 log10 cfu/g) and in two on the 10th day (8.3 and 3.9 log10 cfu/g, respectively). In the second phase of the study, five additional volunteers consumed L. acidophilus 821-3 (daily 1x1010 cfu) for 5 consecutive days. The strain was subsequently detected in faeces of all individuals using real-time PCR on the 10th day (range 4.6-6.7; median 6.0 log10 cell/g) in both phases of the study for at least 5 days after discontinuation of consumption. The administration of high doses of different Lactobacillus strains did not result in any severe adverse effects in GIT and/or abnormal values of blood indices. Thus, the strain L. acidophilus 821-3 is a promising candidate for probiotic and biotechnological applications. Further studies will be performed to confirm the strain persistence and safety in a larger number of individuals.
TI  - Analysis of the human intestinal epithelial cell transcriptional response to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus salivarius, Bifidobacterium lactis and Escherichia coli.
AB  - The complex microbial population residing in the human gastrointestinal tract consists of commensal, potential pathogenic and beneficial species, which are probably perceived differently by the host and consequently could be expected to trigger specific transcriptional responses. Here, we provide a comparative analysis of the global in vitro transcriptional response of human intestinal epithelial cells to Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM, Lactobacillus salivarius Ls-33, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis 420, and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 (EHEC). Interestingly, L. salivarius Ls-33 DCE-induced changes were overall more similar to those of B. lactis 420 than to L. acidophilus NCFM, which is consistent with previously observed in vivo immunomodulation properties. In the gene ontology and pathway analyses both specific and unspecific changes were observed. Common to all was the regulation of apoptosis and adipogenesis, and lipid-metabolism related regulation by the probiotics. Specific changes such as regulation of cell-cell adhesion by B. lactis 420, superoxide metabolism by L. salivarius Ls-33, and regulation of MAPK pathway by L. acidophilus NCFM were noted. Furthermore, fundamental differences were observed between the pathogenic and probiotic treatments in the Toll-like receptor pathway, especially for adapter molecules with a lowered level of transcriptional activation of MyD88, TRIF, IRAK1 and TRAF6 by probiotics compared to EHEC. The results in this study provide insights into the relationship between probiotics and human intestinal epithelial cells, notably with regard to strain-specific responses, and highlight the differences between transcriptional responses to pathogenic and probiotic bacteria.
TI  - Crystal structure of alpha-galactosidase from Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM: insight into tetramer formation and substrate binding.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM is a probiotic bacterium known for its beneficial  effects on human health. The importance of alpha-galactosidases (alpha-Gals) for growth of probiotic organisms on oligosaccharides of the raffinose family present in many foods is increasingly recognized. Here, the crystal structure of alpha-Gal from L. acidophilus NCFM (LaMel36A) of glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 36 (GH36) is determined by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion. In addition, a 1.58-A-resolution crystallographic complex with alpha-d-galactose at substrate binding subsite -1 was determined. LaMel36A has a large N-terminal twisted beta-sandwich domain, connected by a long alpha-helix to the catalytic (beta/alpha)(8)-barrel domain, and a C-terminal beta-sheet domain. Four identical monomers form a tightly packed tetramer where three monomers contribute to the structural integrity of the active site in each monomer. Structural comparison of LaMel36A with the monomeric Thermotoga maritima alpha-Gal (TmGal36A) reveals that O2 of alpha-d-galactose in LaMel36A interacts with a backbone nitrogen in a glycine-rich loop of the catalytic domain, whereas the corresponding atom in TmGal36A is from a tryptophan side chain belonging to the N-terminal domain. Thus, two distinctly different structural motifs participate in substrate recognition. The tetrameric LaMel36A furthermore has a much deeper active site than the monomeric TmGal36A, which possibly modulates substrate specificity. Sequence analysis of GH36, inspired by the observed structural differences, results in four distinct subgroups having clearly different active-site sequence motifs. This novel subdivision incorporates functional and architectural features and may aid further biochemical and structural analyses within GH36.
TI  - Impairment of swimming motility by antidiarrheic Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LB retards internalization of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium within human enterocyte-like cells.
AB  - We report that both culture and the cell-free culture supernatant (CFCS) of Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LB (Lacteol Boucard) have the ability (i) to delay the appearance of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain SL1344-induced mobilization of F-actin and, subsequently, (ii) to retard cell entry by S. Typhimurium SL1344. Time-lapse imaging and Western immunoblotting showed that S. Typhimurium SL1344 swimming motility, as represented by cell tracks of various types, was rapidly but temporarily blocked without affecting the expression of FliC flagellar propeller protein. We show that the product(s) secreted by L. acidophilus LB that supports the inhibitory activity is heat stable and of low molecular weight. The product(s) caused rapid depolarization of the S. Typhimurium SL1344 cytoplasmic membrane without affecting bacterial viability. We identified inhibition of swimming motility as a newly discovered mechanism by which the secreted product(s) of L. acidophilus strain LB retards the internalization of the diarrhea-associated pathogen S. enterica serovar Typhimurium within cultured human enterocyte-like cells.
TI  - Sequencing and analysis of three plasmids from Lactobacillus casei TISTR1341 and  development of plasmid-derived Escherichia coli-L. casei shuttle vectors.
AB  - Pyrosequencing followed by conventional PCR and sequencing was used to determine  the complete nucleotide sequence of three plasmids (pRCEID2.9, pRCEID3.2, and pRCEID13.9) from the Lactobacillus casei strain TISTR1341. The plasmid sequences were found to be almost identical, respectively, to those of pLA106, pLA105, and pLA103 from Lactobacillus acidophilus strain TK8912, suggesting that these strains may be related. Sequence analysis and comparison indicated that pRCEID2.9 replicates by a rolling circle (RC) mechanism, while pRCEID3.2 and pRCEID13.9 probably follow a theta-type mode of replication. Replicons of pRCEID2.9 and pRCEID13.9 were used to develop Escherichia coli/L. casei compatible shuttle vectors, which were stably maintained in different genetic backgrounds. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis showed copy numbers of around 4 and 15, respectively, for the pRCEID13.9- and pRCEID2.9-derived shuttle vectors per chromosome equivalent. The functionality of vector pRCEID-LC13.9 was proved by cloning and expressing in L. casei of a green fluorescent protein gene variant from Aequorea victoria under the control of the promoter from a homologous lactate dehydrogenase gene. The new vectors might complement those currently in use for the exploitation of L. casei as a cellular factory and in other biotechnological applications.
TI  - Integrative food grade expression system for lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM is a probiotic microbe with the ability to survive passage to the -gastrointestinal tract, interact intimately with the host and induce immune responses. The genome of NCFM has been determined and the bacterium is genetically accessible. Therefore, L. acidophilus has excellent potential for use as a vaccine delivery vehicle to express antigens at mucosal surfaces. Plasmids, commonly used to carry antigen encoding genes, are inherently unstable and require constant selection by antibiotics, which can be problematic for in vivo studies and clinical trials. Chromosomal expression of gene cassettes encoding antigens offers enhanced genetic stability by eliminating requirements for marker selection. This work illustrates the integration and inducible expression of the reporter gene gusA3, -encoding a beta-glucuronidase (GusA3), in the L. acidophilus chromosome. A previously described upp-counterselectable gene replacement system was used to direct insertion of the gusA3 gene into an intergenic chromosomal location downstream of lacZ (LBA1462), encoding a beta-galactosidase. The transcriptional activity of integrated gusA3 was evaluated by GUS activity assays using 4-methyl-umbelliferyl-beta-D: -glucuronide (MUG) and was determined to be one to two orders of magnitude higher than the GusA3-negative parent, NCK1909. The successful chromosomal integration and expression of GusA3 demonstrate the potential of this method for higher levels of inducible gene expression in L. acidophilus.
TI  - Selective and differential enumerations of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium spp. in yoghurt--a review.
AB  - Yoghurt is increasingly being used as a carrier of probiotic bacteria for their potential health benefits. To meet with a recommended level of >/=10(6) viable cells/g of a product, assessment of viability of probiotic bacteria in market preparations is crucial. This requires a working method for selective enumeration of these probiotic bacteria and lactic acid bacteria in yoghurt such as Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lb. acidophilus, Lb. casei and Bifidobacterium. This chapter presents an overview of media that could be used for differential and selective enumerations of yoghurt bacteria. De Man Rogosa Sharpe agar containing fructose (MRSF), MRS agar pH 5.2 (MRS 5.2), reinforced clostridial prussian blue agar at pH 5.0 (RCPB 5.0) or reinforced clostridial agar at pH 5.3 (RCA 5.3) are suitable for enumeration of Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus when the incubation is carried out at 45 degrees C for 72h. S. thermophilus (ST) agar and M17 are recommended for selective enumeration of S. thermophilus. Selective enumeration of Lb. acidophilus in mixed culture could be made in Rogosa agar added with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside (X-Glu) or MRS containing maltose (MRSM) and incubation in a 20% CO2 atmosphere. Lb. casei could be selectively enumerated on specially formulated Lb. casei (LC) agar from products containing yoghurt starter bacteria (S. thermophilus and Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), Lb. acidophilus, Bifidobacterium spp. and Lb. casei. Bifidobacterium could be enumerated on MRS agar supplemented with nalidixic acid, paromomycin, neomycin sulphate and lithium chloride (MRS-NPNL) under anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees C for 72h.
TI  - Evaluation of safety margins of Chenopodium album seed decoction: 14-day subacute toxicity and microbicidal activity studies.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sperm immobilizing activity and plausible mechanism of action of Chenopodium album seed decoction (CAD) have been elucidated in our earlier studies. The present study has been carried out to explore the safety standards of CAD along with microbicidal properties as prerequisite for its use as a topically applicable vaginal contraceptive. METHODS: The safety standards of CAD were assessed by a) Hemolytic index determination using rabbit erythrocytes, to set the doses of the other experiments, b) Dermal irritancy test using refined version of Draize scoring system on rabbits, c) Possible effect on local tissues and reproductive performance in female rats after fourteen daily single dose application, d) PCNA staining- to evaluate the effect of CAD on vaginal tissue proliferation, e) TUNEL assay- to examine its ability to induce in situ apoptosis in the vaginal tissue sections of the treated animals, and f) Microbicidal activity- to explore the effect of CAD on the growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Candida albicans. RESULTS: In vitro irritation studies on rabbit erythrocytes revealed the hemolytic index of CAD to be 8.2 mg/ml. The dermal irritation test showed it to be a non-irritant even at higher doses. Intra vaginal application of CAD in rat vagina for 14 consecutive days caused slight reversible inflammation on vaginal epithelial cells at doses as high as 82 mg/ml. However, at this dose level it neither had any adverse effect on vaginal tissue proliferation nor did it cause in situ apoptosis as evident from PCNA staining and TUNEL assay. Fertility and fecundity were restored 4-15 days after withdrawal of CAD application. At dose level 10 times that of its spermicidal MEC (minimum effective concentration), CAD did not block the growth of Lactobacillus, although the size of individual colony was marginally reduced. However, growth of the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans was completely inhibited with 20 mg/ml of CAD. CONCLUSION: The overall result evolved from the study strengthens the candidature of CAD as a safe microbicidal spermicide. It is almost non-irritant to rabbit skin and rat vaginal tissues at doses 10 fold higher than its hemolytic index. The effect of CAD on Lactobacillus culture was not highly encouraging but it prevented the growth of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans at 20 mg/ml of CAD.
TI  - [Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM affects host adhesion-related gene expression after adhering to host].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Adhering to the intestinal epithelial cells is one of the beneficial functions exerting by probiotics. We tested and verified the expression of adhesion-related genes in vivo and in vitro to understand the influence from Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM on host cells. METHOD: We selected the adhesion-related genes through GO (gene ontology) category from the Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array analysis. These genes were verified by in vitro Caco-2 cells culture model and in vivo mouse model using Real-time PCR method. RESULTS: After L. acidophilus NCFM adhering to Caco-2, we found that 12 adhesion-related genes were up-regulated. The up-regulation was confirmed in vivo and in vitro by Real-time PCR assay. Among them, the up-regulated expression of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) gene was the most distinguished one. CONCLUSION: Our research showed that L. acidophilus NCFM, adhering to Caco-2 cells, could cause the differential expression of the host adhesion-related genes. Results of this study seemed to provide some useful data for further revealing its effect on intestinal epithelial cells.
TI  - [Expression of PTX3 gene in Caco-2 cells treated with Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the expression of immunity and inflammatory mediator factor PTX3 in intestinal epithelial cells treated with Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and further to reveal the regulatory mechanism. METHODS: Caco-2 cells were cocultured with Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM for 0, 2, 4, 8, 12 h and 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 h respectively, then the total RNA and protein were extracted. The expression of PTX3 gene was analyzed by Real Time RT-PCR. The phosphorylation levels of NF-kappaB was analyzed by Western Blot. Caco-2 cells were pretreated with PDTC for 30 min before cocultured with Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM for 2 h, then the total RNA was extracted and the expression of PTX3 gene was analyzed by Real Time RT-PCR. RESULTS: Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM could induce the expression of PTX3 in Caco-2 cells. The PTX3 expression peaked at 4 h after coculture. Then its expression gradually waned out. Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM could rapidly activate the phosphorylation of NF-kappaB, and the expression of PTX3 was decreased notably after pretreated with PDTC for 30 min. CONCLUSION: Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM could transiently regulate the immunity and inflammatory mediator factor PTX3 expression through rapidly activating NF-kappaB signaling pathway in Caco-2 cells.
TI  - Some low homogenization pressures improve certain probiotic characteristics of yogurt culture bacteria and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-K.
AB  - Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus, and Lactobacillus acidophilus are dairy cultures widely used in the manufacture of cultured dairy products. Commonly used homogenization pressures in the dairy industry are 13.80 MPa or less. It is not known whether low homogenization pressures can stimulate bacteria to improve their probiotic characteristics. Objectives were to determine the effect of homogenization at 0, 3.45, 6.90, 10.34, and 13.80 MPa on acid tolerance, bile tolerance, protease activity, and growth of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus LB-12, S. salivarius ssp. thermophilus ST-M5, and L. acidophilus LA-K. The cultures were individually inoculated in cool autoclaved skim milk (4 degrees C) and homogenized for 5 continuous passes. Growth and bile tolerance of samples were determined hourly for 10h of incubation. Acid tolerance was determined every 20 min for 120 min of incubation. Protease activity was determined at 0, 12, and 24h of incubation. All homogenization pressures studied improved acid tolerance of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus LB-12 but had no beneficial effect on protease activity and had negative effects on growth and bile tolerance. A pressure of 6.90 MPa improved acid tolerance, bile tolerance, and protease activity of S. salivarius ssp. thermophilus ST-M5, but none of the homogenization pressures studied had an effect on its growth. Homogenization pressures of 13.80 and 6.90 MPa improved acid tolerance and bile tolerance, respectively, of L. acidophilus LA-K but had no effect on protease activity and its growth. Some low homogenization pressures positively influenced some characteristics of yogurt culture bacteria and L. acidophilus LA-K. Culture pretreatment with some low homogenization pressures can be recommended for improvement of certain probiotic characteristics.
TI  - Dissimilar properties of two recombinant Lactobacillus acidophilus strains displaying Salmonella FliC with different anchoring motifs.
AB  - Display of heterologous antigens on the cell surface is considered a useful technique for vaccine delivery by recombinant lactobacilli. In this study, two recombinant Lactobacillus acidophilus derivatives displaying Salmonella flagellin (FliC) were constructed using different anchor motifs. In one instance, the FliC protein was fused to the C-terminal region of a cell envelope proteinase (PrtP) and was bound to the cell wall by electrostatic bonds. In the other case, the same antigen was conjugated to the anchor region of mucus binding protein (Mub) and was covalently associated with the cell wall by an LPXTG motif. These two recombinant L. acidophilus cell surface displays resulted in dissimilar maturation and cytokine production by human myeloid dendritic cells. The surface-associated antigen was highly sensitive to simulated gastric and small intestinal juices. By supplementation with bicarbonate buffer and soybean trypsin inhibitor, the cell surface antigen was protected from proteolytic enzymes during gastric challenge in vitro. The protective reagents also increased the viability of the L. acidophilus cells upon challenge with simulated digestive juices. These results demonstrate the importance of protecting cells and their surface-associated antigens during oral immunization.
TI  - The quorum sensing luxS gene is induced in Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM in response to Listeria monocytogenes.
AB  - The luxS gene involved in quorum sensing has been shown to control different behaviour of probiotic lactobacilli. In this study we investigated if luxS in Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM was up-regulated in response to Listeria monocytogenes EGD-e. The two bacterial strains were grown in mono- and co-culture and the growth of both bacteria and the transcriptional level of luxS in L. acidophilus cells were monitored. Contrary to L. acidophilus, the growth of L. monocytogenes was significantly affected by co-cultivation. Transcriptional analysis showed that the expression of luxS increased during exponential growth in L. acidophilus cells with the highest level in the late-exponential growth phase, decreasing in the stationary phase. Following co-cultivation with L. monocytogenes, the transcriptional level of luxS increased significantly in mid-exponential growing cells of L. acidophilus after incubation with viable L. monocytogenes cells and by addition of cell-free culture supernatant of L. monocytogenes, whereas incubation with heat killed cells of L. monocytogenes had no effect on the transcriptional level. This could indicate that the up-regulation of luxS is due to a response to a secreted compound produced by L. monocytogenes cells.
TI  - Enhanced growth of lactobacilli and bioconversion of isoflavones in biotin-supplemented soymilk upon ultrasound-treatment.
AB  - This study aimed at utilizing ultrasound treatment to further enhance the growth  of lactobacilli and their isoflavone bioconversion activities in biotin-supplemented soymilk. Strains of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus acidophilus BT 1088, L. fermentum BT 8219, L. acidophilus FTDC 8633, L. gasseri FTDC 8131) were treated with ultrasound (30 kHz, 100 W) at different amplitudes (20%, 60% and 100%) for 60, 120 and 180 s prior to inoculation and fermentation in biotin-soymilk. The treatment affected the fatty acids chain of the cellular membrane lipid bilayer, as shown by an increased lipid peroxidation (P<0.05). This led to increased membrane fluidity and subsequently, membrane permeability (P<0.05). The permeabilized cellular membranes had facilitated nutrient internalization and subsequent growth enhancement (P<0.05). Higher amplitudes and longer durations of the treatment promoted growth of lactobacilli in soymilk, with viable counts exceeding 9 log CFU/mL. The intracellular and extracellular beta-glucosidase specific activities of lactobacilli were also enhanced (P<0.05) upon ultrasound treatment, leading to increased bioconversion of isoflavones in soymilk, particularly genistin and malonyl genistin to genistein. Results from this study show that ultrasound treatment on lactobacilli cells promotes (P<0.05) the beta-glucosidase activity of cells for the benefit of enhanced (P<0.05) isoflavone glucosides bioconversion to bioactive aglycones in soymilk.
TI  - Characterization of adhesive molecule with affinity to Caco-2 cells in Lactobacillus acidophilus by proteome analysis.
AB  - The adhesive activities of eight Lactobacillus acidophilus strains toward intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells were studied to understand the probiotic characteristics of the L. acidophilus L-92 strain. Most of the strains, including L-92, showed high adhesive activity; CP23 showed the lowest adhesive activity. CP23 was selected for comparative analysis of cell wall-associated proteins versus the L-92 strain. Cell wall-associated proteins extracted from L-92 and CP23 were subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis, and major spots observed in the former were compared to the corresponding spots in the latter. To understand the effects of key components of L-92 on its adhesion to Caco-2 cells, 18 spots with stronger signals in L-92 than those in CP23 were identified by a MALDI-TOF/TOF of Ultraflex analysis. Among the identified proteins of L-92, surface-layer protein A (SlpA) was considered strongly involved in adhesion in the eight L. acidophilus strains. To study the importance of SlpA in the adhesion of L. acidophilus, the amounts of SlpA proteins in LiCl extracts of the eight strains were compared by SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As a result, the adhesive abilities of L. acidophilus strains to Caco-2 cells correlated closely to the amount of SlpA in the cells and the productivity of IL-12, an inflammatory cytokine, in all eight strains. These results strongly suggested that SlpA in L. acidophilus might play a key role in its attachment to Caco-2 cells and in the release of IL-12 from dendritic cells.
TI  - Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG as an Effective Probiotic for Murine Giardiasis.
AB  - The gut microflora is an important constituent in the intestinal mucosal barrier  and has been introduced as the concept of probiotic therapy that beneficially affects the host by improving its intestinal microbial balance. Therefore, the main objective of the study was to explore the protective potential of various lactobacilli strains for murine giardiasis. By experimentation, it was found that the probiotic supplementation of either Lactobacillus casei, L. acidophilus, L. plantarum, or L. rhamnosus GG, 7 days prior to inoculation with G. lamblia trophozoites, reduced the rate of cyst excretion compared with Giardia-infected mice. Interestingly, L. GG was found to be the most effective probiotic in reducing the duration of giardia cycle and acts as an effective prophylactic probiotic for murine giardiasis but needs to be clinically correlated due to entirely different human microflora.
TI  - Proteome reference map of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and quantitative proteomics towards understanding the prebiotic action of lactitol.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM is a probiotic bacterium adapted to survive in the gastrointestinal tract and with potential health benefits to the host. Lactitol is a synthetic sugar alcohol used as a sugar replacement in low calorie foods and selectively stimulating growth of L. acidophilus NCFM. In the present study the whole-cell extract proteome of L. acidophilus NCFM grown on glucose until late exponential phase was resolved by 2-DE (pH 3-7). A total of 275 unique proteins assigned to various physiological processes were identified from 650 spots. Differential 2-DE (DIGE) (pH 4-7) of L. acidophilus NCFM grown on glucose and lactitol, revealed 68 spots with modified relative intensity. Thirty-two unique proteins were identified in 41 of these spots changing 1.6-12.7-fold in relative abundance by adaptation of L. acidophilus NCFM to growth on lactitol. These proteins included beta-galactosidase small subunit, galactokinase, galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase and UDP-glucose-4-epimerase, which all are potentially involved in lactitol metabolism. This first comprehensive proteome analysis of L. acidophilus NCFM provides insights into protein abundance changes elicited by the prebiotic lactitol.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of gastrointestinal survival of Lactobacillus amylovorus DSM  16698 alone and combined with galactooligosaccharides, milk and/or Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bb-12.
AB  - Probiotic properties of Lactobacillus amylovorus DSM 16698 were previously demonstrated in piglets. Here, its potential as a human probiotic was studied in vitro, using the TIM-1 system, which is fully validated to simulate the human upper gastrointestinal tract. To evaluate the effect of the food matrix composition on the survival of L. amylovorus DSM 16698 in TIM-1, the microorganism was inoculated alone or with prebiotic galactooligosaccharides (GOS), partially skimmed milk (PSM) and/or commercial probiotic Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bb-12 (Bb-12). Samples were collected from TIM-1 for six hours, at one-hour intervals and L. amylovorus populations were enumerated on MRS agar plates with confirmation of identity of selected isolates by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fingerprinting. The cumulative survival for L. amylovorus alone (control) was 30% at the end of the experiment (t=6h). Co-administration of L. amylovorus with GOS, PSM and/or Bb-12 increased its survival in comparison with the control significantly from the 4th hour after ingestion onwards (P<0.05). Furthermore, by the use of High Performance Anion Exchange Chromatography, both L. amylovorus and Bb-12 were observed to promptly degrade GOS compounds in samples collected from TIM-1, as assessed at t=2h. Hence, food matrix composition interfered with survival and growth of L. amylovorus during passage through TIM-1, providing leads towards optimization of probiotic properties in vivo.
TI  - Oral treatment of chickens with lactobacilli influences elicitation of immune responses.
AB  - Commensal microbes in the intestine are in constant interaction with host cells and play a role in shaping the immune system. Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus reuteri, and Lactobacillus salivarius are members of the chicken intestinal microbiota and have been shown to induce different cytokine profiles in mononuclear cells in vitro. The objective of the present study was to examine the effects of these bacteria individually or in combination on the induction of antibody- and cell-mediated immune responses in vivo. The birds received lactobacilli weekly via oral gavage starting on day of hatch and subsequently, at 14 and 21 days, were immunized with sheep red blood cells (SRBC), keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), Newcastle disease virus vaccine, and infectious bursal disease virus vaccine. Antibody responses in serum were measured weekly for 4 weeks beginning on the day of primary immunization. The cell-mediated immune response was evaluated at 21 days postimmunization by measurement of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) production in splenocytes stimulated with inactivated vaccine antigens. L. salivarius-treated birds had significantly more serum antibody to SRBC and KLH than birds that were not treated with probiotics. L. salivarius-treated birds also had decreased cell-mediated immune responses to recall antigen stimulation. L. reuteri treatment did not significantly affect the systemic immune response, while L. acidophilus treatment increased the antibody response to KLH. These results indicate that systemic antibody- and cell-mediated immune responses can be modulated by oral treatment with lactobacilli but that these bacteria may vary in their ability to modulate the immune response.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial effects of commercially available mouth-wetting agents.
AB  - Products have been developed to provide palliation for persons with dry mouth. In addition to mouth-wetting agents, some products incorporate antimicrobial constituents with the goal of improving oral microbial defenses. The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the potential antimicrobial and antifungal effects of two commercially available saliva substitutes on Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Candida albicans by using the agar-well diffusion method. Antimicrobial activity as measured by the size of the inhibition zone growth for S. mutans and L. acidophilus was observed only with Biotene Dry Mouth Oral Rinse(R) and BioXtra(R) gel. The zone of inhibition of Biotene Dry Mouth Oral Rinse was larger than that of BioXtra gel (p= 0.00, p < 0.01). No anticandidal effect was seen with any of the test products. The pH of the preparations, the variations between the amount of active ingredients within the products, and the potential antimicrobial effects of inactive ingredients should be investigated to determine the factors that impacted microbial inhibition.
TI  - Agrowaste-based nanofibers as a probiotic encapsulant: fabrication and characterization.
AB  - This study explored the potential of soluble dietary fiber (SDF) from agrowastes, okara (soybean solid waste), oil palm trunk (OPT), and oil palm frond (OPF) obtained via alkali treatment, in the nanoencapsulation of Lactobacillus acidophilus . SDF solutions were amended with 8% poly(vinyl alcohol) to produce nanofibers using electrospinning technology. The spinning solution made from okara had a higher pH value at 5.39 +/- 0.01 and a higher viscosity at 578.00 +/- 11.02 mPa.s (P < 0.05), which resulted in finer fibers. FTIR spectra of nanofibers showed the presence of hemicellulose material in the SDF. Thermal behavior of nanofibers suggested possible thermal protection of probiotics in heat-processed foods. L. acidophilus was incorporated into the spinning solution to produce nanofiber-encapsulated probiotic, measuring 229-703 nm, visible under fluorescence microscopy. Viability studies showed good bacterial survivability of 78.6-90% under electrospinning conditions and retained viability at refrigeration temperature during the 21 day storage study.
TI  - Regulation of the IL-10/IL-12 axis in human dendritic cells with probiotic bacteria.
AB  - In this study, we have used monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) to design a screening model for the selection of microorganisms with the ability to suppress DC-secreted IL-12p70, a critical cytokine for the induction of T-helper cell type 1 immune responses under inflammatory conditions. By the treatment of DCs with cocktails containing TLR agonists and proinflammatory cytokines, the cells increased the secretion of the Th1-promoting cytokine IL-12p70. Clinically used probiotics were tested for their IL-10- and IL-12p70-stimulating properties in immature DCs, and showed a dose-dependent change in the IL-10/IL-12p70 balance. Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM() and the probiotic mixture VSL#3 showed a strong induction of IL-12p70, whereas Lactobacillus salivarius Ls-33 and Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 preferentially induced IL-10. Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 induced both IL-10 and IL-12p70, whereas the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii induced low levels of cytokines. When combining these microorganisms with the Th1-promoting cocktails, E. coli Nissle 1917 and B. infantis 35624 were potent suppressors of IL-12p70 secretion in an IL-10-independent manner, indicating a suppressive effect on Th1-inducing antigen-presenting cells. The present model, using cocktail-stimulated DCs with potent IL-12p70-stimulating capacity, may be used as an efficient tool to assess the anti-inflammatory properties of microorganisms for potential clinical use.
TI  - Lactobacillus S-layer protein inhibition of Salmonella-induced reorganization of  the cytoskeleton and activation of MAPK signalling pathways in Caco-2 cells.
AB  - Surface layer (S-layer) proteins are crystalline arrays of proteinaceous subunits that are present as the outermost component of the cell wall in several Lactobacillus species. The S-layer proteins have been shown to play a role in the antimicrobial activity of certain lactobacilli. However, it is not fully understood how the S-layer proteins exert this biological function. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that Lactobacillus acidophilus S-layer proteins antagonize Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) infection by protecting against F-actin cytoskeleton rearrangements and the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathways. Monolayer transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) was measured after S. Typhimurium infection in Caco-2 cultured human intestinal cells with L. acidophilus S-layer proteins. F-actin rearrangement and MAPK activation were also assessed by immunofluorescence staining or Western blotting. The results showed that when S. Typhimurium was co-incubated with S-layer proteins, the S. Typhimurium-induced Caco-2 cell F-actin rearrangement was reduced, and the S. Typhimurium-induced TER decrease and interleukin 8 (IL-8) secretion were attenuated. Additionally, L. acidophilus S-layer proteins could inhibit S. Typhimurium-induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38. This study indicates that L. acidophilus S-layer proteins are able to inhibit S. Typhimurium infection through blocking S. Typhimurium-induced F-actin rearrangements and S. Typhimurium-induced ERK1/2, JNK and p38 activation in Caco-2 cells. These data provide a rationale for the use of lactobacillus S-layer proteins as therapeutic and preventative agents, at least in infectious diarrhoea.
TI  - Effect of probiotic yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis on lipid profile in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of probiotic and conventional yogurt on the lipid profile in type 2 diabetic people. In a randomized double-blind controlled trial, 60 people (23 males and 37 females) with type 2 diabetes and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) greater than 2.6 mmol/L were assigned to 2 groups. Participants consumed daily 300 g of probiotic yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 or 300 g of conventional yogurt for 6 wk. Fasting blood samples, anthropometric measurements and 3-d, 24-h dietary recalls were collected at the baseline and at the end of the trial. Probiotic yogurt consumption caused a 4.54% decrease in total cholesterol and a 7.45% decrease in LDL-C compared with the control group. No significant changes from baseline were shown in triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in the probiotic group. The total cholesterol:HDL-C ratio and LDL-C:HDL-C ratio as atherogenic indices significantly decreased in the probiotic group compared with the control group. Probiotic yogurt improved total cholesterol and LDL-C concentrations in type 2 diabetic people and may contribute to the improvement of cardiovascular disease risk factors.
TI  - Effect of functional yogurt NY-YP901 in improving the trait of metabolic syndrome.
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: This study was aimed to assess the beneficial effects on metabolic syndrome of functional yogurt NY-YP901 (Namyang Dairy Product Co. Ltd and Nutra R&BT Inc., Seoul, Korea) supplemented with mixture of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium infantis and extra-ingredients containing Bifidobacterium breve (CBG-C2), Enterococcus faecalis FK-23, fibersol-2 and so on. SUBJECTS/METHODS: This study was designed as an 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study. Treatment and control groups consumed a functional yogurt NY-YP901 (150 ml) and a placebo yogurt twice a day, respectively, for 8 weeks. Body weight and body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, lipid profiles, fasting glucose with HbA1C and waist circumference were measured before and after treatment. Inclusion criteria were healthy individuals between the ages 20-65 years old who submitted an informed consent. RESULTS: During the period August 2009 to December 2009, 101 healthy participants (31 males and 70 females) finished the study. Treatment group were 53 individuals, and the control group were 48 individuals. In the treatment group consuming NY-YP901, statistically significant beneficial changes were observed in body weight (treatment group vs control group=-0.24+/-1.50 vs +0.64+/-1.39 kg, P<0.05), BMI (-0.10+/-0.58 vs +0.24+/-0.50 kg/m(2), P<0.05 ) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (-7.71+/-14.14 vs -0.43+/-15.32 mg/dl, P<0.05) after 8 weeks. The change in other parameters was not different between the treatment and the control groups. CONCLUSIONS: The functional yogurt NY-YP901 reduced LDL-cholesterol, body weight and BMI in the subjects at a 300-ml consumption daily for 8 weeks. From these findings, regular intake of functional yogurt NY-YP901 may be consequently related to improve metabolic syndrome.
TI  - Quantitative transcript analysis of the inducible expression system pSIP: comparison of the overexpression of Lactobacillus spp. beta-galactosidases in Lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Two sets of overlapping genes, lacLMReu and lacLMAci, encoding heterodimeric beta-galactosidases from Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus acidophilus, respectively, have previously been cloned and expressed using the pSIP vector system and Lactobacillus plantarum WCSF1 as host. Despite the high similarity between these lacLM genes and the use of identical cloning and expression strategies, strains harboring lacLMReu produced about twenty-fold more beta-galactosidase than strains containing lacLMAci. RESULTS: In this study, the plasmid copy numbers (PCN) of expression vectors pEH9R (lacLMReu) and pEH9A (lacLMAci) as well as the transcription levels of both lacLM genes were compared using quantitative PCR methods. Analyses of parallel fermentations of L. plantarum harboring either pEH9R or pEH9A showed that the expression plasmids were present in similar copy numbers. However, transcript levels of lacLM from L. reuteri (pEH9R) were up to 18 times higher than those of lacLM from L. acidophilus (pEH9A). As a control, it was shown that the expression levels of regulatory genes involved in pheromone-induced promoter activation were similar in both strains. CONCLUSION: The use of identical expression strategies for highly similar genes led to very different mRNA levels. The data indicate that this difference is primarily caused by translational effects that are likely to affect both mRNA synthesis rates and mRNA stability. These translational effects thus seem to be a dominant determinant for the success of gene expression efforts in lactobacilli.
TI  - [Survival of probiotic microorganisms in the conditions in vitro imitating the process of human digestion].
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Assessment of survival bifidobacteria and lactobacteria under the conditions in vitro, simulating digestion in human stomach and intestine, and study of survival probiotic and indigenous microorganisms in co-cultivation on solid nutrient medium. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Probiotic microorganisms from commercial preparations Bifidobacterin and Lactobacterin, clinical isolates lactobacillus (Lactobacillus acidophilus No 1, L. brevis No 2) were used in experiments. Survival study of probiotic microorganisms was performed on a model in vitro, simulating the process of digestion in the human body. Assessment of the relationship of probiotic microorganisms and indigenous microorganisms was carried out in co-cultivation in vitro on solid nutrient medium. RESULTS: A significant reduction in the number of viable probiotic microorganisms during their incubation in model media was set as well as suppression of probiotic microorganisms growth by cultures of a clinical strains of lactobacillus, corresponding to biocompatibility by type "host against probiotic". CONCLUSION: While choosing probiotics in the treatment of dysbacterioses the character of relationship between probiotic microorganisms and indigenous microorganisms of a patient is recommended to be preliminarily tested. Also microorganisms of own microflora should be stimulated using modern prebiotics.
TI  - Bioactive compounds and prebiotic activity in Thailand-grown red and white guava  fruit (Psidium guajava L.).
AB  - This research involves the comparison of bioactive compounds, volatile compounds  and prebiotic activity of white guava (Psidium guajava L.) cv. Pansithong and red guava cv. Samsi. The antioxidant activity values determined by 2-diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays were 10.28 microg fresh weight (fw)/microg DPPH and 78.56 microg Trolox equivalent (TE)/g fw for white guava and 7.82 microg/microg DPPH, fw and 111.06 microM TE/g fw for red guava. Ascorbic acid contents were 130 and 112mg/100g fw total phenolics contents 145.52 and 163.36 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/100 g fw and total flavonoids contents 19.06 and 35.85 mg catechin equivalents (CE)/100 g fw, in white and red guava, respectively. Volatile compounds in guava were analyzed by the solid-phase microextraction (SPME)/gas chromatography (GC)/mass spectrometry (MS) method. The major constituents identified in white and red guavas were cinnamyl alcohol, ethyl benzoate, ss-caryophyllene, (E)-3-hexenyl acetate and alpha-bisabolene. Prebiotic activity scores for Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 and Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12 were 0.12 and 0.28 in white guava, respectively, and 0.13 and 0.29 in red guava, respectively.
TI  - Probiotic Dahi containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum alleviates age-inflicted oxidative stress and improves expression of biomarkers of ageing in mice.
AB  - The potential benefiting effects of probiotic Dahi on age-inflicted accumulation  of oxidation products, antioxidant enzymes and expression of biomarkers of ageing were evaluated in mice. Probiotic Dahi were prepared by co-culturing in buffalo milk (3% fat) Dahi bacteria (Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris NCDC-86 and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis biovar diacetylactis NCDC-60) along with selected strain of Lactobacillus acidophilus LaVK2 (La-Dahi) or combined L. acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum BbVK3 (LaBb-Dahi). Four groups of 12 months old mice (6 each) were fed for 4 months supplements (5 g/day) of buffalo milk (3% fat), Dahi, La-Dahi and LaBb-Dahi, respectively, with basal diet. The activities of catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) declined and the contents of oxidation products, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and protein carbonyls, increased in red blood corpuscles (RBCs), liver, kidney and heart tissues and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity increased in RBCs and hepatic tissues during ageing of mice. Feeding ageing mice with La-Dahi or LaBb-Dahi increased CAT activity in all the four tissues, and GPx activity in RBCs and hepatic tissue, and a significant decline in TBARS in plasma, kidney and hepatic tissues and protein carbonyls in plasma. Feeding mice with probiotic Dahi also reversed age related decline in expression of biomarkers of ageing, peroxisome proliferators activated receptor-alpha, senescence marker protein-30 (SMP-30) and klotho in hepatic and kidney tissues. The present study suggests that probiotic Dahi containing selected strains of bacteria can be used as a potential nutraceutical intervention to combat oxidative stress and molecular alterations associated with ageing.
TI  - Use of the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridisation technique for in vivo detection of  cariogenic microorganisms on metallic brackets, with or without use of an antimicrobial agent.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridisation (CDDH) assay, this randomised clinical study evaluated the contamination of metallic brackets by four cariogenic bacterial strains (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus) and the efficacy of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) mouthwashes in reducing bacterial contamination. METHODS: Thirty-nine 11-33-year-old patients under treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances were enrolled in the study and had 2 new metallic brackets bonded to premolars. Nineteen patients used a 0.12% CHX mouthwash (Periogard) and 20 patients used a placebo mouthwash (control) twice a week. After 30 days, the brackets were removed and samples were obtained for analysis by CDDH. Data were analysed statistically by the Kruskal-Wallis test (alpha=0.05) using the SAS software. RESULTS: S. mutans, S. sobrinus, L. casei and L. acidophilus were detected in 100% of the samples from both groups. However, brackets of the control group were more heavily contaminated by S. mutans and S. sobrinus (P<0.01). In the experimental group, although all counts decreased after rinsing with the chlorhexidine solution, there was significant difference only for S. mutans (P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The use of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwashes can be useful in clinical practice to reduce the levels of cariogenic microorganisms in patients under treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances.
TI  - Probiotics in functional bowel disorders getting it right.
AB  
TI  - Effect of kynurenic acid on the viability of probiotics in vitro.
AB  - Probiotics are bacteria that are commercially available as dietary supplements. One of the important properties of probiotics is their ability to survive in the intestine. Recent evidence has identified kynurenic acid (KYNA) as a bactericidal constituent of intestinal fluid. These data led us to study the influence of KYNA on the viability of selected probiotics. We found that KYNA supported the growth of bacteria in the probiotics Acidolac (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium) and Lakcid Forte (Lactobacillus rhamnosus) or retarded the growth of bacteria from the Acidolac, BioGaia (Lactobacillus reuteri Protectis), Dicoflor (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG), Lacium (Lactobacillus plantarum) and Trilac (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis) probiotics depending on its concentration. KYNA did not affect the viability of bacteria from the probiotic Linex (Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12). Our results suggest a potential role of KYNA in the regulation of bacterial growth in the digestive system.
TI  - IBD: Modified Lactobacillus acidophilus may regulate intestinal inflammation.
AB  
TI  - Immunomodulatory effects of lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium on both murine and  human mitogen-activated T cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Beneficial effects of probiotics have been reported for patients with allergic diseases and intestinal disorders. There is increasing interest in studying the role of different strains or combined probiotic administration on immunoregulation. In this study, we investigated whether probiotics modulate the immune response through regulating T cell proliferation and differentiation. METHODS: We examined the effect of probiotic I (a combination of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidus) and probiotic II (a combination of L. acidophilus and B. infantis) on cell survival and proliferation, the progression of the cell cycle, and the production of Th1/Th2 cytokines by mitogen-stimulated murine spleen cells and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). RESULTS: Our experimental results showed that high concentrations (>/= 1 x 10(6) CFU/ml) of probiotic I or II inhibited mitogen-induced cell proliferation and arrested the cell cycle at the G0/G1 stage in both mitogen-stimulated spleen cells and PBMCs. In the results of low concentrations (<1 x 10(6) CFU/ml), probiotic I or II enhanced the production of IFN-gamma but inhibited the production of IL-4. Our results indicated that high concentrations of probiotic I or II treatment could attenuate mitogen-induced overactive immune responses. On the other hand, low concentrations of probiotic I or II treatment could promote a shift in the Th1/Th2 balance toward Th1-skewed immunity. CONCLUSION: Dose selection is an important issue for probiotic studies. Our results indicated that probiotics have beneficial effects on regulating T cell-mediated immune responses by attenuating mitogen-induced overactive immune responses and promoting Th1 immune responses.
TI  - [Probiotics as an items of increasing the effectiveness of treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in adolescents].
AB  - The aim of the work was to evaluate the efficiency of microbial probiotics Vitaflor and metabolic probiotic Aktoflor-C in complex treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in adolescents in a hospital. The observation involved 38 children aged 11 to 18 years with radiologically verified community-acquired pneumonia, including 23 boys and 15 girls. Patients were divided in 3 groups. Patients in group 1 (n = 13) simultaneously with the antibiotic therapy received per os Vitaflor probiotic containing symbiotic strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus; patients in group 2 (n = 10) along with antibiotic therapy received per os metabolic probiotic Aktoflor-C, containing low molecular weight exometabolites bacteria; patient of the comparison group (n = 15) received antibiotic therapy only. The effectiveness of the used treatment schemes was assessed on the dynamics of the gut state microbiot acoarding to an extended bacteriological examination of faecal flora, level of saliva IgA secretory (before and after treatment), the dynamics of SF-36 quality of life 1 month after discharge from hospital. Was conducted a study of economic efficiency of different modes of therapy. Results showed that adolescents with community-acquired pneumonia during standard antibiotic therapy indicated development of dysbiotic bowel disturbances in the form of reliable oppression of the bifidobacteria and laktoflora. Dysbiosis of the microbial associations are not conducive to proper implementation of immune and nutritional functions of the intestine that shows the imperfection of rehabilitation of patients with pneumonia according to the evaluation of SF-36 quality of life. Pharmacoeconomic analysis revealed the benefits of probiotic metabolic type "Aktoflor" used in addition to standard therapy of community-acquired pneumonia in adolescents.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus S-layer protein-mediated inhibition of Salmonella-induced apoptosis in Caco-2 cells.
AB  - Surface layer (S-layer) proteins are crystalline arrays of proteinaceous subunits present as the outermost component of the cell wall in several Lactobacillus species. The underlying mechanism for how S-layer proteins inhibit pathogen infections remains unclear. To gain insights into the mechanism of the antimicrobial activity of Lactobacillus S-layer proteins, we examined how Lactobacillus S-layer proteins impact Salmonella Typhimurium-induced apoptosis in vitro in Caco-2 human colon epithelial cells. When Caco-2 cells infected with Salmonella Typhimurium SL1344, we found that apoptosis was mediated by activation of caspase-3, but not caspase-1. When Salmonella Typhimurium SL1344 and S-layer proteins were coincubated simultaneously, Caco-2 cell apoptosis was markedly decreased and the cell damage was modified, as evaluated by flow cytometry and microscopy. Detailed analyses showed that the S-layer proteins inhibited the caspase-3 activity and activated the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway. Taken together, these findings suggest that Lactobacillus S-layer proteins protected against Salmonella-induced apoptosis through reduced caspase-3 activation. In addition, Salmonella-induced apoptotic cell damage was modified by S-layer proteins through the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. This mechanism may represent a novel approach for antagonizing Salmonella infection.
TI  - Proteolytic activity of lactic acid bacteria strains and fungal biota for potential use as starter cultures in dry-cured ham.
AB  - During the processing of dry-cured meat products, sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar proteins undergo proteolysis, which has a marked effect on product flavor. Microbial proteolytic activity is due to the action of mostly lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and to a lesser extent micrococci. The proteolytic capacity of molds in various meat products is of interest to meat processors in the Mediterranean area. Eleven LAB and mold strains from different commercial origins were tested for proteolytic activity against pork myosin, with a view to possible use of these strains as starter cultures for Iberian dry-cured ham. Proteolytic activity was tested by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The LAB strains with the highest proteolytic activity were Lactobacillus plantarum (L115), Pediococcus pentosaceus (Saga P TM), and Lactobacillus acidophilus (FARGO 606 TM). The best fungal candidate was Penicillium nalgiovense LEM 50I followed by Penicillium digitatum, Debaryomyces hansenii, and Penicillium chrysogenum.
TI  - Microbial and chemical markers: runoff transfer in animal manure-amended soils.
AB  - Fecal contamination of water resources is evaluated by the enumeration of the fecal coliforms and Enterococci. However, the enumeration of these indicators does not allow us to differentiate between the sources of fecal contamination. Therefore, it is important to use alternative indicators of fecal contamination to identify livestock contamination in surface waters. The concentration of fecal indicators (, enteroccoci, and F-specific bacteriophages), microbiological markers (Rum-2-bac, Pig-2-bac, and ), and chemical fingerprints (sterols and stanols and other chemical compounds analyzed by 3D-fluorescence excitation-matrix spectroscopy) were determined in runoff waters generated by an artificial rainfall simulator. Three replicate plot experiments were conducted with swine slurry and cattle manure at agronomic nitrogen application rates. Low amounts of bacterial indicators (1.9-4.7%) are released in runoff water from swine-slurry-amended soils, whereas greater amounts (1.1-28.3%) of these indicators are released in runoff water from cattle-manure-amended soils. Microbial and chemical markers from animal manure were transferred to runoff water, allowing discrimination between swine and cattle fecal contamination in the environment via runoff after manure spreading. Host-specific bacterial and chemical markers were quantified for the first time in runoff waters samples after the experimental spreading of swine slurry or cattle manure.
TI  - Effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus & epidermal growth factor on experimentally induced Clostridium difficile infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD) remains  an important nosocomial ailment. Antimicrobial therapy used for CDAD gives inconsistent results. This experimental study was planned to investigate the beneficial effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus and epidermal growth factor (EGF) for CDAD management. METHODS: Among 10 groups of BALB/c mice (6 in each), group 1 served as controls receiving no inoculum. Animals in groups 2-10 received C. difficile, those in groups 3, 6 and 9 received L. acidophilus and those in groups 4, 7 and 10 received EGF after C. difficile inoculation. Animals in groups 5-7 were pre-treated with ampicillin and those in groups 8-10 with lansoprazole prior to C. difficile. The animals were killed and investigated for colonisation by C. difficile and toxin production, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and histopathology. RESULTS: Colonisation by C. difficile was found to be significantly different (P<0.001) in the various groups. C. difficile toxin titres and MPO activity were significantly lower in animals given L. acidophilus and EGF after ampicillin (groups 6 and 7) and lansoprazole (groups 9 and 10). The severity of acute inflammation was also significantly less (P<0.05) in caecal and colonic segments of animals in groups 6 and 7 compared to those in group 5. Although the severity of acute inflammation was less in the caecal and colonic segment of animals in groups 9 and 10, the reduction was not significant compared to group 8. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that the administration of L. acidophilus and EGF reduced the severity of C. difficile infection in the experimental animals.
TI  - Adherent properties and macrophage activation ability of 3 strains of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) must possess probiotic properties in order to be beneficial to humans and animals. The adherent properties, the acid and bile tolerance as well as the macrophage activation ability of isolated LAB strains were investigated in this study. The adhesion was analyzed following heat, acid, trypsin, and sodium periodate treatments. Production of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) by RAW 264.7 macrophages was also measured after stimulation with heat-killed LAB strains. The viable strains of Lactobacillus fermentum AF7, L. acidophilus GG5, and L. plantarum BB9 were able to tightly adhere to the intestinal Caco-2 cells. In addition, the GG5 strain was not affected by heating, acid, trypsin, or sodium periodate treatment. However, the adhesion of strains AF7 and BB9 was reduced significantly by heating and trypsin treatment. This result suggested the GG5 and AF7 or BB9 strains had different cell-surface adherent factors. TNF-alpha production by the RAW 264.7 macrophages was induced significantly following stimulation with heat-killed LAB at 10(8) CFU/mL in a dose-dependent fashion. In addition, macrophage activity was similar whether the treatment consisted of live probiotics, or probiotics treated with heat, acid, or trypsin. However, the activity was reduced after treating with sonication. These in vitro results showed that the LAB studied possess probiotic characteristics, such as acid or bile tolerance, adherent capability, and immune activation, and may suggest that these LAB strains retain their probiotic activity as they pass through the gastrointestinal tract.
TI  - Assessment of potential probiotic properties of Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus spp., and Pediococcus spp. strains isolated from kefir.
AB  - In this study, the metabolic activities (in terms of quantities of the produced lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and exopolysaccharides) of 8 strains of Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus spp., and Pediococcus spp., were determined. Lactic acid levels produced by strains were 8.1 to 17.4 mg/L. The L. acidophilus Z1L strain produced the maximum amount (3.18 mug/mL) of hydrogen peroxide. The exopolysaccharides (EPS) production by the strains was ranged between 173 and 378 mg/L. The susceptibility of 7 different antibiotics against these strains was also tested. All strains were found to be sensitive to ampicillin. The tolerance of the strains to low pH, their resistance to bile salts of strains, and their abilities to autoaggregate and coaggregate with Escherichia coli ATCC 11229 were also evaluated. High EPS-producing strains showed significant autoaggregation and coaggregation ability with test bacteria (P < 0.01). A correlation also was determined between EPS production and acid-bile tolerance (P < 0.05). EPS production possibly affects or is involved in acid-bile tolerance and aggregation of Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus spp., and Pediococcus spp. strains and supports the potential of L. acidophilus Z1L strain as new probiotic.
TI  - LC-MS/MS analysis of surface layer proteins as a useful method for the identification of lactobacilli from the Lactobacillus acidophilus group.
AB  - For precise identification of a Lactobacillus K1 isolate, LC-MS/MS analysis of the putative surface layer protein was performed. The results obtained from LTQ-FT-ICR mass spectrometry confirmed that the analyzed protein spot is the surface layer protein originating from Lb. helveticus species. Moreover, the identified protein has the highest similarity with the surface layer protein from Lb. helveticus R0052. To evaluate the proteomic study, multilocus sequence analysis of selected housekeeping gene sequences was performed. Combination of 16S rRNA sequencing with partial sequences for the genes encoding the RNA polymerase alpha subunit (rpoA), phenylalanyl-tRNA synthase alpha subunit (pheS), translational elongation factor Tu (tuf), and Hsp60 chaperonins (groEL) also allowed to classify the analyzed isolate as Lb. helveticus. Further classification at the strain level was achieved by sequencing of the slp gene. This gene showed 99.8% identity with the corresponding slp gene of Lb. helveticus R0052, which is in good agreement with data obtained by nano-HPLC coupled to an LTQ-FT-ICR mass spectrometer. Finally, LC-MS/ MS analysis of surface layer proteins extracted from three other Lactobacillus strains proved that the proposed method is the appropriate molecular tool for the identification of S-layer-possessing lactobacilli at the species and even strain levels.
TI  - Survival of probiotic adjunct cultures in cheese and challenges in their enumeration using selective media.
AB  - Various selective media for enumerating probiotic and cheese cultures were screened, with 6 media then used to study survival of probiotic bacteria in full-fat and low-fat Cheddar cheese. Commercial strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus paracasei, or Bifidobacterium lactis were added as probiotic adjuncts. The selective media, designed to promote growth of certain lactic acid bacteria (LAB) over others or to differentiate between LAB, were used to detect individual LAB types during cheese storage. Commercial strains of Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium spp. were initially screened on the 6 selective media along with nonstarter LAB (NSLAB) isolates. The microbial flora of the cheeses was analyzed during 9 mo of storage at 6 degrees C. Many NSLAB were able to grow on media presumed selective for Lactococcus, Bifidobacterium spp., or Lb. acidophilus, which became apparent after 90 d of cheese storage, Between 90 and 120 d of storage, bacterial counts changed on media selective for Bifidobacterium spp., suggesting growth of NSLAB. Appearance of NSLAB on Lb. casei selective media [de man, Rogosa, and Sharpe (MRS)+vancomycin] occurred sooner (30 d) in low-fat cheese than in full-fat control cheeses. Differentiation between NSLAB and Lactococcus was achieved by counting after 18 to 24h when the NSLAB colonies were only pinpoint in size. Growth of NSLAB on the various selective media during aging means that probiotic adjunct cultures added during cheesemaking can only be enumerated with confidence on selective media for up to 3 or 4 mo. After this time, growth of NSLAB obfuscates enumeration of probiotic adjuncts. When adjunct Lb. casei or Lb. paracasei cultures are added during cheesemaking, they appear to remain at high numbers for a long time (9 mo) when counted on MRS+vancomycin medium, but a reasonable probability exists that they have been overtaken by NSLAB, which also grow readily on this medium. Enumeration using multiple selective media can provide insight into whether it is the actual adjunct culture or a NSLAB strain that is being enumerated.
TI  - Application of novel starter cultures for sourdough bread production.
AB  - Sourdough application has been extensively increased in the last years due to the consumers demand for food consumption without the addition of chemical preservatives. Several starter cultures have been applied in sourdough bread making targeting the increase of bread self-life and the improvement of sensorial character. More specific, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus sakei as single and mixed cultures were used for sourdough bread making. Various sourdough breads were produced with the addition of sourdough perviously prepared with 10% w/w L. acidophilus, 10% w/w L. sakei and 5% w/w L. acidophilus and 5% w/w L. sakei at the same time. Various chemical parameters were determined such as lactic acid, total titratable acidity and pH. The results revealed that the produced sourdough bread made with sourdough containing the mixed culture was preserved for more days (12 days) than all the other breads produced in the frame of this study, since it contained lactic acid in higher concentrations. The respective total titratable acidity varied between 10.5 and 11 ml NaOH N/10. The same sourdough bread had a firmer texture, better aroma, flavor and overall quality compared to other sourdough breads examined in this study, as shown by sensory evaluation tests and results obtained through SPME GC-MS analysis, which revealed significant differences among the different bread types.
TI  - Consumption of probiotics increases the effect of regulatory T cells in transfer  colitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics may alter immune regulation. Recently, we showed that the  probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM influenced the activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in vitro. The aim of the present work was to demonstrate if L. acidophilus NCFM also affects the function of Tregs in vivo. METHODS: Development of colitis after transfer of CD4+CD25- T cells and protection from colitis by Tregs was studied in immunodeficient SCID mice which were simultaneously tube-fed with L. acidophilus NCFM or L. salivarius Ls-33 for 5 weeks. RESULTS: Probiotic-fed SCID mice transplanted with low numbers of Tregs in addition to the disease-inducing T cells were completely protected from colitis. This was in contrast to the control group, which showed intermediate levels of inflammation. In addition, feeding with probiotics lowered serum levels of inflammatory cytokines in both colitic mice and in mice protected from colitis by Tregs. Gene expression patterns of rectum samples of protected mice that receive either one of the probiotics showed a closer resemblance to naive SCID mice than did patterns of the control group. The mechanism of action of the probiotics appears to be an indirect effect by inducing a Treg-favorable environment rather than a direct effect on the Tregs. CONCLUSIONS: L. acidophilus NCFM and L. salivarius Ls-33 feeding of SCID mice increases the in vivo effect of Tregs, resulting in a gene expression pattern in the rectum resembling that of the naive SCID mouse.
TI  - Metabolism of L-selenomethionine and selenite by probiotic bacteria: in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB  - Since selenium supplements have been shown to undergo biotransformation in the gut, probiotic treatment in combination with selenium supplements may change selenium disposition. We investigated the metabolism of L-selenomethionine (SeMet) and selenite by probiotic bacteria in vitro and the disposition of selenium after probiotic treatment followed by oral dosing with SeMet and selenite in rats. When SeMet was incubated anaerobically with individual antibiotic-resistant probiotic strains (Streptococcus salivarius K12, Lactobacillus rhamnosus 67B, Lactobacillus acidophilus L10, and Bifidobacterium lactis LAFTI(R) B94) at 37 degrees C for 24 h, 11-18% was metabolized with 44-80% of SeMet lost being converted to dimethyldiselenide (DMDSe) and dimethylselenide (DMSe). In similar incubations with selenite, metabolism was more extensive (26-100%) particularly by the lactobacilli with 0-4.8% of selenite lost being converted to DMSe and DMDSe accompanied by the formation of elemental selenium. Four groups of rats (n = 5/group) received a single oral dose of either SeMet or selenite (2 mg selenium/kg) at the time of the last dose of a probiotic mixture or its vehicle (lyoprotectant mixture used to maintain cell viability) administered every 12 h for 3 days. Another three groups of rats (n = 3/group) received a single oral dose of saline or SeMet or selenite at the same dose (untreated rats). Serum selenium concentrations over the subsequent 24 h were not significantly different between probiotic and vehicle treated rats but appeared to be more sustained (SeMet) or higher (selenite) than in the corresponding groups of untreated rats. Probiotic treated rats given SeMet also had selenium concentrations at 24 h that were significantly higher in liver and lower in kidney than untreated rats given SeMet. Thus, treatment with probiotics followed by SeMet significantly affects tissue levels of selenium.
TI  - Development of gammadelta T cell subset responses in gnotobiotic pigs infected with human rotaviruses and colonized with probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  - gammadelta T cell responses are induced by various viral and bacterial infections. Different gammadelta T cells contribute to activation and regulation of the inflammatory response and to epithelial repair. How gammadelta T cells respond to rotavirus infection and how the colonization of probiotics influences the gammadelta T cell response were unknown. In this study, we evaluated by multicolor flow cytometry the frequencies and distribution of total gammadelta T cells and three major subsets (CD2-CD8-, CD2+CD8- and CD2+CD8+) in ileum, spleen and blood of gnotobiotic (Gn) pigs at early (3-5 days) and late phases (28 days) after rotavirus infection. The Gn pigs were inoculated with the virulent human rotavirus Wa strain and colonized with a mixture of two strains of probiotics Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus reuteri. In naive pigs, the highest frequency of total gammadelta T cells was found in blood, followed by spleen and ileum at the early age (8-10 days old) whereas in older pigs (32 days of age) the highest frequency of total gammadelta T cells was found in ileum and spleen followed by blood. Rotavirus infection significantly increased frequencies of intestinal total gammadelta T cells and the putatively regulatory CD2+CD8+ gammadelta T cell subset and decreased frequencies of the putatively proinflammatory CD8- subsets in ileum, spleen and blood at post-infection days (PID) 3 or 5. The three gammadelta T cell subsets distributed and responded differently after rotavirus infection and/or lactobacilli colonization. The CD2+CD8+ subset contributed the most to the expansion of total gammadelta T cells after rotavirus infection in ileum because more than 77% of the total gammadelta T cells there were CD2+CD8+ cells. There was an additive effect between lactobacilli and rotavirus in inducing total gammadelta T cell expansion in ileum at PID 5. The overall effect of lactobacilli colonization versus rotavirus infection on frequencies of the CD2+CD8+ gammadelta T cell subset in ileum was similar; however, rotavirus-infected pigs maintained significantly higher frequencies of CD8- subsets in ileum than lactobacilli-colonized pigs. The dynamic gammadelta T cell responses suggest that gammadelta T cell subsets may play important roles in different stages of immune responses after rotavirus infection and probiotic colonization. The knowledge on the kinetics and distribution patterns of gammadelta T cell subsets in naive pigs and after rotavirus infection or lactobacilli colonization provides the foundation for further mechanistic studies of their functions.
TI  - Group-specific comparison of four lactobacilli isolated from human sources using  differential blast analysis.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been used in fermentation processes for centuries. More recent applications including the use of LAB as probiotics have significantly increased industrial interest. Here we present a comparative genomic analysis of four completely sequenced Lactobacillus strains, isolated from the human gastrointestinal tract, versus 25 lactic acid bacterial genomes present in the public database at the time of analysis. Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM, Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC533, Lactobacillus gasseri ATCC33323, and Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1are all considered probiotic and widely used in industrial applications. Using Differential Blast Analysis (DBA), each genome was compared to the respective remaining three other Lactobacillus and 25 other LAB genomes. DBA highlighted strain-specific genes that were not represented in any other LAB used in this analysis and also identified group-specific genes shared within lactobacilli. Initial comparative analyses highlighted a significant number of genes involved in cell adhesion, stress responses, DNA repair and modification, and metabolic capabilities. Furthermore, the range of the recently identified potential autonomous units (PAUs) was broadened significantly, indicating the possibility of distinct families within this genetic element. Based on in silico results obtained for the model organism L. acidophilus NCFM, DBA proved to be a valuable tool to identify new key genetic regions for functional genomics and also suggested re-classification of previously annotated genes.
TI  - Complete genome sequencing of Lactobacillus acidophilus 30SC, isolated from swine intestine.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus 30SC has been isolated from swine intestines and considered a probiotic strain for dairy products because of its ability to assimilate cholesterol and produce bacteriocins. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of Lactobacillus acidophilus 30SC (2,078,001 bp) exhibiting strong acid resistance and enhanced bile tolerance.
TI  - Genome sequence of Lactobacillus amylovorus GRL1118, isolated from pig ileum.
AB  - Lactobacillus amylovorus is a common member of the beneficial microbiota present  in the pig gastrointestinal tract. Here, we report the genome sequence of the surface layer (S-layer) protein-carrying and potentially probiotic strain L. amylovorus GRL1118, which was isolated from porcine ileum and which shows strong adherence to pig intestinal epithelial cells.
TI  - The combination of mixed lactic acid bacteria and dietary fiber lowers serum cholesterol levels and fecal harmful enzyme activities in rats.
AB  - Probiotics such as lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and prebiotics such as fiber are generally considered beneficial for health. These affect the microflora composition and fermentation metabolites and consequently contribute to local and systemic effects in humans. The beneficial effects of probiotics can be improved when combined with prebiotics. Here we investigated the effects of a mixed LAB supplement combined with dietary fiber on the population of LAB in the gut, as well as on serum cholesterol levels, fecal water content and microbial harmful enzyme activities. For animal studies, 0.2 mL of mixed LAB (Bifidobacterium longum SPM1205, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and SAFELAC isolated from Pediococcus pentosaceus) supplement (10(7) approximately 10(8) colony forming units per day) was orally administered to male Sprague-Dawley rats every day for 2 weeks along with a diet containing 5% or 10% cellulose. The mixed LAB supplement combined with dietary cellulose significantly (p < 0.05) reduced serum total cholesterol and LDL levels. This combination also significantly (p < 0.05) increased the population of LAB and the fecal water content and significantly (p < 0.05) reduced microbial harmful enzyme (beta-glucosidase, beta-glucuronidase and tryptophanase) activities. These effects of LAB were particularly improved by its combination with 5% cellulose compared to the control (a diet without cellulose), and the 5% cellulose combination was more effective than the 10% cellulose combination. In conclusion, the incorporation of a fibrous diet such as cellulose with lactic acid bacteria improved the population of LAB, and daily consumption of this combination could reduce the serum cholesterol levels and activities of harmful enzymes such as beta-glucosidase, beta-glucuronidase, tryptophanase, urease in rats.
TI  - Salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli modulations in young children on consumption of probiotic ice-cream containing Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 and Lactobacillus acidophilus La5.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the levels of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in saliva of school children, before and after consumption of probiotic and control ice-cream. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled trial was carried out in forty, 12-14 year-old children, with no clinically detectable caries. The selected children were randomized equally into two groups I and II. Following an initial run-in period of 1 week, children in group I and II were given ice-creams 'A' and 'B', respectively, for 10 days. Being a cross-over study, the ice-creams were interchanged in the two groups after a 2-week wash-out period. Saliva samples at baseline and follow-up were assessed using Dentocult SM and Dentocult LB kits. RESULTS: On statistical evaluation, it was seen that probiotic ice-cream brought about a statistically significant reduction (p-value = 0.003) in salivary mutans streptococci levels with no significant effect on lactobacilli levels. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, probiotic ice-cream containing Bifidobacterium lactis Bb-12 ATCC27536 and Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 can reduce the levels of certain caries-associated micro-organisms in saliva.
TI  - Probiotic Fermented Milk Containing Dietary Fiber Has Additive Effects in IBS with Constipation Compared to Plain Probiotic Fermented Milk.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Although controversial, probiotics and dietary fiber are commonly used for patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We evaluated the effects of multistrain probiotics on the symptoms of IBS to determine whether the addition of dietary fi ber had an additive effect on constipation-predominant IBS. METHODS: A total of 142 participants who met the Rome III criteria were recruited and randomized into a control group or a test group. Participants in the control group received multistrain probiotic fermented milk with Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium infantis; the participants in the test group received the same probiotic fermented milk mixed with dietary fi ber such as sea tangle extracts, radish extracts and glasswort extracts. The patients were treated for four weeks. RESULTS: Most of the symptoms of IBS, with the exception of fl atulence, stool consistency, and frequency of defecation, signifi cantly improved in both groups. In the analysis of IBS subtypes, especially constipation-predominant IBS, the frequency and duration of defecation and straining at stool were improved more in the test group than in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary fiber had additive benefits for the symptoms of constipation, especially in constipation-predominant IBS.
TI  - A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial with Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 for maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To investigate the clinical effect of treatment with Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 (Probio-Tec AB-25) to maintain remission in patients with ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Patients with left-sided ulcerative colitis in remission - including proctitis and at least one relapse within the last year were randomised (2:1) in a double-blind placebo-controlled study to Probio-Tec AB-25 or placebo for 52 weeks. The patients were evaluated clinically, endoscopically and histologically at entry and if relapsing. No other medication for ulcerative colitis than the study drug was allowed during the study. Primary endpoint was maintenance of clinical remission, secondary endpoints comparisons of days to relapse, and safety and tolerability of the study drug. The concentrations of the probiotic bacterial strains in stool were analysed in a subset of patients. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were randomised. Twenty patients received Probio-Tec AB-25 and twelve patients received placebo. Five patients (25%) in the Probio-Tec AB-25 group and one patient (8%) in the placebo group maintained remission after 1 year of treatment (p=0.37). The median time to relapse was 125.5days (range 11-391 days) in the probiotic group and 104 days (range 28-369 days) in the placebo group respectively, (p=0.683). Probio-Tec AB-25 was overall well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: In this small randomised placebo-controlled trial no significant clinical benefit of Probio-Tec AB-25 could be demonstrated in comparison with placebo for maintaining remission in patients with left-sided ulcerative colitis. A difference may be achieved in larger studies, but the clinical significance of this would be questionable. This study was registered in ClinicalTrial.gov (NCT00268164).
TI  - Effects of probiotic fermented milk on symptoms and intestinal flora in patients  with irritable bowel syndrome: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The effect of probiotics on IBS symptoms has been mixed, but remains an intriguing treatment option with appeal to the patient. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients fulfilling the Rome II criteria were randomized double-blind to a daily intake of 500 ml of fermented milk containing at least 5 x 10(7) CFU/ml of Lactobacillus paracasei ssp paracasei F19, Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 or an equal volume of acidified milk for 8 weeks. Symptoms were assessed at baseline and weekly using a disease-specific validated symptom rating scale (IBS-SSI). The predefined primary outcome measure was patient reported adequate symptom relief. Adherence to study protocol were assessed by performing stool samples at the of the treatment period. RESULTS: Eight-one patients were screened. Sixty-four patients were randomized; 18 patients did not complete the study due to protocol violations or withdrew due to lack of effect. Fifty-two patients (13 males) completed the study as per protocol; mean age was 51.3 years (range 29-67). The proportion of patients reporting adequate symptom relief increased in both patient groups, but there was not any statistical difference between the groups. IBS-SSI scores did not differ statistically between the groups at the end of the treatment period, but improved during the study period in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: During this 8-week trial gastrointestinal symptoms improved. However, there was no difference between treatment with fermented milk containing probiotics or acidified milk. The effect of probiotics on IBS symptoms remains uncertain and further studies are warranted.
TI  - [PH and oxidation-reduction potential change of environment during a growth of lactic acid bacteria: effects of oxidizers and reducers].
AB  - Decrease of pH and dropping of oxidation-reduction potential have been observed during growing Lactobacillus salivarius 1588 and 3823, Lactobacillus acidophilus 101E, and Lactococcus lactis 3690 in anaerobic conditions in medium with glucose acidification. These parameters and membrane proton permeability of bacteria (C(M)(H+)) changed in the mediums with different pH. Oxidizer ferrycianide and reducer DL-dithiothreitol affected the bacterial growth and their changed H+ extrusion from the cells and K+ uptake by the cells in experiment conditions. Application of oxidizers and reducers are suggested for regulation of growth related with H+ ion transport in lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and Bifidobacterium lactis Bi-07 versus placebo for the symptoms of bloating in patients with functional bowel disorders: a double-blind study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent data suggest a role for the intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of functional bowel disorders (FBDs). Probiotic studies in FBDs generated inconsistent results suggesting a strain-specific and product-specific effect. AIM: To investigate the clinical efficacy of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM (L-NCFM) and Bifidobacterium lactis Bi-07 (B-LBi07) in nonconstipation FBDs. METHODS: A double-blind, placebo-control clinical trial of the probiotic bacterias L-NCFM and B-LBi07 twice a day (2x10(11) CFU/d) versus placebo over 8 weeks. Primary endpoints were global relief of gastrointestinal symptoms and satisfaction with treatment. Secondary endpoints were change in symptoms severity, well-being, and quality of life. Microbiological effect was assessed by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction on fecal samples. RESULTS: Sixty patients (probiotic, n=31; placebo, n=29), 72% females, 84% whites, mean age 37 years. Abdominal bloating improved in the probiotics compared with the placebo group at 4 weeks (4.10 vs 6.17, P=0.009; change in bloating severity P=0.02) and 8 weeks (4.26 vs 5.84, P=0.06; change in bloating severity P<0.01). Analyses on the irritable bowel syndrome subgroup (n=33) showed similar results. CONCLUSIONS: L-NCFM and B-LBi07 twice a day improve symptoms of bloating in patients with FBDs. These data supports the role of intestinal bacteria in the pathophysiology of FBD and the role for probiotic bacteria in the management of these disorders.
TI  - Lactobacillus amylovorus DSM 19280 as a novel food-grade antifungal agent for bakery products.
AB  - Mould spoilage is the main cause of substantial economic loss in bakery industry  and might also cause public health problems due to the production of mycotoxins. The reduction of mould growth in bakery products is thus of crucial importance and there is great interest to develop safe and efficient strategies for this purpose. In this study Lactobacillus amylovorus DSM19280 has been shown to produce a wide spectrum of antifungal compounds active against common bread spoilage fungi. Among the indicator moulds, Aspergillus fumigatus and Fusarium culmorum were the most sensitive organisms. Several antifungal compounds were found to be present in synthetic medium inoculated with L. amylovorus DSM19280 strain, some of them being reported here for the first time. Wheat doughs fermented with L. amylovorus DSM19280 had good rheological properties and the breads thereof were of high quality as shown by rheofermentometer and texture analyser measurements. The results were compared with those obtained with a control non-antifungal L. amylovorus DSM20531(T) strain, a non-acidified and a chemically acidified dough. The quality of sourdough and bread fermented with L. amylovorus DSM 19280 was comparable to that obtained by using L. amylovorus DSM20531 (T). Additionally, breads were evaluated for the ability to retard the growth of Fusarium culmorum FST 4.05, Aspergillus niger FST4.21, Penicillium expansum FST 4.22, Penicillium roqueforti FST 4.11 and fungal flora from the bakery environment. The biological preservation of bread with L. amylovorus DSM 19280 was also compared to the most commonly used antifungal agent Calcium propionate. Breads containing sourdough fermented with L. amylovorus DSM 19280 were more effective in extending the shelf life of bread than the calcium propionate.
TI  - [Identification and analysis of vaginal lactobacilli in patients with bacterial vaginosis patients and healthy women in nationality of Pastoral area].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify and analyze the species of vaginal lactobacilli between patients with bacterial vaginosis (BV) and healthy women at childbearing age in Inner Mongolia. METHODS: From Jun. 2008 to Dec. 2008, 203 Mongolian healthy women, 74 Han healthy women and 102 Mongolian patients with BV from 3 pastoral areas were enrolled in this study. Isolation and culture of lactobacilli from vaginal wall were performed by modified culture medium. DNA of lactobacilli were extracted and sequenced. H(2)O(2) were detected by TMB-HRP-MRS. RESULTS: (1) The rate of lactobacilli identification were 76.8% (156/203) in Mongolian healthy women and 21.6% (22/102) in Mongolian patients with BV, which reached statistical difference (P < 0.01). Lactobacilli identification in Han healthy women [82.4% (61/74)] did not show significant difference with that of Mongolian healthy women (P > 0.05). (2) The total of 193 strains and 11 species of Lactobacillus were detected in 203 Mongolian healthy women. Meanwhile, 22 strains and 4 species of Lactobacillus were found in 102 Mongolian BV cases. (3) The rate of H(2)O(2) generating Lactobacilli was 27.3% (6/22) in Mongolian BV patients and 75.7% (56/74) in Mongolian healthy women, which showed statistical difference (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The rate of Lactobacillus was not related with the race of women in pastoral area in Inner Mongolian. The amount of lactobacilli and H(2)O(2) generating Lactobacilli in the vagina of BV patients was remarkably lower than those of healthy women at childbearing age.
TI  - Lactobacillus gigeriorum sp. nov., isolated from chicken crop.
AB  - In the early 1980s, a facultatively anaerobic, non-motile, short rod, designated  202(T), was isolated from a chicken crop and identified as a homofermentative lactic acid bacterium. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that the strain was affiliated with the genus Lactobacillus, clustering within the Lactobacillus acidophilus-delbrueckii group. In this analysis, strain 202(T) appeared to be most closely related to the type strains of Lactobacillus intestinalis and Lactobacillus amylolyticus, with gene sequence similarities of 96.1 and 96.2 %, respectively. Strain 202(T) was found to differ from these two species, however, when investigated by multilocus sequence analysis, and it also differed in terms of some of its metabolic properties. On the basis of these observations, strain 202(T) is considered to represent a novel species in the genus Lactobacillus, for which the name Lactobacillus gigeriorum sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is 202(T) ( = CRBIP 24.85(T) = DSM 23908(T)).
TI  - Bacterial Pathogenesis
AB  - Infection is the invasion of the host by microorganisms, which then multiply in close association with the host's tissues. Infection is distinguished from disease, a morbid process that does not necessarily involve infection (diabetes, for example, is a disease with no known causative agent). Bacteria can cause a multitude of different infections, ranging in severity from inapparent to fulminating. Table 7-1 lists these types of infections. The capacity of a bacterium to cause disease reflects its relative pathogenicity. On this basis, bacteria can be organized into three major groups. When isolated from a patient, frank or primary pathogens are considered to be probable agents of disease (e.g., when the cause of diarrheal disease is identified by the laboratory isolation of Salmonella spp. from feces). Opportunistic pathogens are those isolated from patients whose host defense mechanisms have been compromised. They may be the agents of disease (e.g., in patients who have been predisposed to urinary tract infections with Escherichia coli by catheterization). Finally, some bacteria, such as Lactobacillus acidophilus, are considered to be nonpathogens, because they rarely or never cause human disease. Their categorization as nonpathogens may change, however, because of the adaptability of bacteria and the detrimental effect of modern radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy on resistance mechanisms. In fact, some bacteria previously considered to be nonpathogens are now known to cause disease. Serratia marcescens, for example, is a common soil bacterium that causes pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and bacteremia in compromised hosts. Virulence is the measure of the pathogenicity of an organism. The degree of virulence is related directly to the ability of the organism to cause disease despite host resistance mechanisms; it is affected by numerous variables such as the number of infecting bacteria, route of entry into the body, specific and nonspecific host defense mechanisms, and virulence factors of the bacterium. Virulence can be measured experimentally by determining the number of bacteria required to cause animal death, illness, or lesions in a defined period after the bacteria are administered by a designated route. Consequently, calculations of a lethal dose affecting 50 percent of a population of animals (LD50) or an effective dose causing a disease symptom in 50 percent of a population of animals (ED50) are useful in comparing the relative virulence of different bacteria. Pathogenesis refers both to the mechanism of infection and to the mechanism by which disease develops. The purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of the many bacterial virulence factors and, where possible, to indicate how they interact with host defense mechanisms and to describe their role in the pathogenesis of disease. It should be understood that the pathogenic mechanisms of many bacterial diseases are poorly understood, while those of others have been probed at the molecular level. The relative importance of an infectious disease to the health of humans and animals does not always coincide with the depth of our understanding of its pathogenesis. This information is best acquired by reading each of the ensuing chapters on specific bacterial diseases, infectious disease texts, and public health bulletins.
TI  - Prunus mume extract exhibits antimicrobial activity against pathogenic oral bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Prunus mume is a common fruit in Asia, which has been used in traditional Chinese medicine. In this study, we focused on the antimicrobial properties of Prunus mume extract against oral pathogens related to dental caries and periodontal diseases. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 15 oral pathogens including Streptococcus mutans, S. sobrinus, S. mitis, S. sanguinis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, P. gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and Candida species were included in the study. Initially, agar diffusion assay was performed to screen the antimicrobial activities of Prunus mume extract. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were then determined for sensitive species. Effect of Prunus mume extract on human oral keratinocytes (HOK) viability was also tested. RESULT: In the agar diffusion assay, drug suspension of 2 g/mL was able to inhibit all the bacterial species tested, but not the fungal species. MIC and MBC range of Prunus mume extract against the oral bacteria was 0.15625-0.0003 g/mL and P. gingivalis being the most susceptible species. Prune extract did not cause any detrimental effect on HOK. CONCLUSION: Prunus mume extract may be a potential candidate for developing an oral antimicrobial agent to control or prevent dental diseases associated with oral pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Lipoteichoic acid-deficient Lactobacillus acidophilus regulates downstream signals.
AB  - The trillions of microbes residing within the intestine induce critical signals that either regulate or stimulate host immunity via their bacterial products. To better understand the immune regulation elicited by lipoteichoic acid (LTA)-deficient Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM in steady state and induced inflammation, we deleted phosphoglycerol transferase gene, which synthesizes LTA in L. acidophilus NCFM. In vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted in order to compare the immune regulatory properties of the L. acidophilus strain deficient in LTA (NCK2025) with its wild-type parent (NCK56) in C57BL/6, C57BL/6 recombination-activation gene 1-deficient (Rag1 (-/-)) and C57BL/6 Rag1(-/-)IL-10(-/-) mice. We demonstrate that NCK2025 significantly activates the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 but downregulates the phosphorylation of Akt1, cytosolic group IV PLA2 and p38 in mouse dendritic cells. Similarly, mice treated orally with NCK2025 exhibit decreased phosphorylation of inflammatory signals (Akt1, cytosolic group IV PLA2 or P38) but upregulate Erk1/2-phosphorylation in colonic epithelial cells in comparison with mice treated with NCK56. In addition, regulation of pathogenic CD4+ T cell induced colitis by NCK2025 was observed in Rag1 (-/-) but not Rag1(-/-)IL-10 (-/-) mice suggests a critical role of IL-10 that may be tightly regulated by Erk1/2 signaling. These data highlight the immunosuppressive properties of NCK2025 to deliver regulatory signals in innate cells, which results in the mitigation of T-cell-induced colitis in vivo.
TI  - (GTG)(5)-PCR fingerprinting of lactobacilli isolated from cervix of healthy women.
AB  - A group of lactobacilli isolated from the cervix of 31 healthy women was characterized by (GTG)(5)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fingerprinting in order to evaluate this method for identification of vaginal lactobacilli. Obtained fingerprints were compared with profiles available in an in-house database of the CCM bacteria collection covering type and reference strains of multiple lactic acid bacteria including lactobacilli. Selected strains representing individual clusters were further identified by pheS gene sequencing. In total, six lactobacillus species were found among lactobacilli isolated from the cervix of healthy women. The (GTG)(5)-PCR method identified Lactobacillus gasseri (11 strains), Lactobacillus fermentum (one), and some of the Lactobacillus jensenii strains (eight out of 11), but failed to identify the remaining strains, including the Lactobacillus crispatus (18), Lactobacillus mucosae (one), and Lactobacillus vaginalis (one) species. L. jensenii strains were distributed over two fingerprint clusters. The majority of samples was dominated by one (GTG)(5)-PCR type. The rep-PCR fingerprinting using the (GTG)(5) primer allowed straightforward identification of many, but not all, isolates. This method has been shown to be a useful tool for fast screening and grouping of vaginal lactobacilli, but its combination with another identification method is needed to obtain reliable identification results. In addition, Lactobacillus acidophilus was not shown to be the most common inhabitant of the female genital tract as generally assumed.
TI  - [Species composition and antibiotic resistance of lactobacillus in infants].
AB  - AIM: To study species composition and antibiotic resistance of indigenous bacteria from Lactobacillus genus in infants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-six strains of lactobacilli isolated from feces of infants living in Kazan. Species membership of lactobacilli was determined using PCR with primers for identification of 7 species of lactobacilli: L. acidophilus, L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus, L. delbrueckii, L. casei, L. paracasei, and L. zeae. Susceptibility to antibiotics was determined by indicator paper discs method. RESULTS. In breastfed infants L. fermentum and L. rhamnosus dominated, whereas in artificially fed infants colonization with L. casei and L. paracasei was characteristic. L.acidophilus, L. plantarum, and L. zeae were not detected in infants. In 6 cases isolates could be identified only to genus characteristic. Lactobacilli were polyresistant and had from 8 to 15 markers of resistance. All strains were resistant to ciprofloxacin, co-trimoxazole, ceftriaxone, nitroxoline, metronidazole, furazolidone, and 95% of strains were resistant to vancomycin. In 60-70% of cases lactobacilli were susceptible to penicillin, linezolid, erythromycin and lyncomycin. CONCLUSION: Regional features of species composition and antibiotic resistance of lactobacilli in infants depending on type of feeding were revealed.
TI  - Development of probiotic carriers using microbial transglutaminase-crosslinked soy protein isolate incorporated with agrowastes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics are live micro-organisms that exert beneficial effects on  their host. A high survival rate during gastrointestinal transit and storage is often desirable. The main aim of this study was to develop protective carriers for probiotics via the use of enzymatically crosslinked soy protein isolate incorporated with agrowastes such as banana peel, banana pulp, cempedak rind and cocoa rind. RESULTS: Addition of agrowastes significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the strength and pH and darkened the colour of the gel. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that microbial transglutaminase induced crosslinking in the carrier network, while scanning electron microscopy showed that agrowaste addition resulted in a denser, finer and thinner protein network. Controlled release and swelling tests of the carriers in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids showed a low release under gastric conditions but a high release under intestinal conditions. The viability of Lactobacillus acidophilus FTDC 1331 incorporated in carriers containing agrowastes was more stable during storage at 4 degrees C for 28 days compared with the control (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that agrowastes could be utilised as new probiotic carriers for enhanced gastrointestinal transit and storage.
TI  - Identification and characterization of potential autochthonous starter cultures from a Croatian "brand" product "Slavonski kulen".
AB  - The microbial population of a traditional Croatian fermented sausage "Slavonski kulen" was isolated, identified and subjected to technological and functional characterization in order to select potential autochthonous functional starter cultures. Dominant microflora were lactic acid bacteria (LAB), followed by staphylococci. Identification of isolated lactobacilli showed domination of Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Lactobacillus acidophilus while Staphylococcus xylosus and Staphylococcus warneri outnumbered the staphylococcal microbiota. Most of the isolated LAB and Staphylococcus species displayed good growth in the presence of 5% of NaCl and at 12, 18 and 22 degrees C. All LAB and most of the staphylococci possess proteolytic activity and only Staphylococcus xylosus had lipolytic activity. All lactobacilli and staphylococci isolates produced significant concentrations of lactic acid (as determined by HPLC) and showed antimicrobial activity against pathogenic test microorganisms. Dominant LAB and Staphylococcus species displayed growth in the presence of 1% bile. Most of the staphylococci and all of lactobacilli showed sensitivity to all antibiotics tested.
TI  - Construction of vectors for inducible and constitutive gene expression in Lactobacillus.
AB  - Microarray analysis of the genome of Lactobacillus acidophilus identified a number of operons that were differentially expressed in response to carbohydrate source or constitutively expressed regardless of carbohydrate source. These included operons implicated in the transport and catabolism of fructooligosaccharides (FOS), lactose (lac), trehalose (tre) and genes directing glycolysis. Analysis of these operons identified a number of putative promoter and repressor elements, which were used to construct a series of expression vectors for use in lactobacilli, based on the broad host range pWV01 replicon. A beta-glucuronidase (GusA3) reporter gene was cloned into each vector to characterize expression from each promoter. GUS reporter assays showed FOS, lac and tre based vectors to be highly inducible by their specific carbohydrate and repressed by glucose. Additionally, a construct based on the phosphoglycerate mutase (pgm) promoter was constitutively highly expressed. To demonstrate the potential utility of these vectors, we constructed a plasmid for the overexpression of the oxalate degradation pathway (Frc and Oxc) of L. acidophilus NCFM. This construct was able to improve oxalate degradation by L. gasseri ATCC 33323 and compliment a L. acidophilus oxalate-deficient mutant. Development of these expression vectors could support several novel applications, including the expression of enzymes, proteins, vaccines and biotherapeutics by intestinal lactobacilli.
TI  - Localized delivery of interferon-beta by Lactobacillus exacerbates experimental colitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There have been conflicting reports of the role of Type I interferons (IFN) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Clinical trials have shown potent efficacy of systemic interferon-beta (IFN-beta) in inducing remission of ulcerative colitis. Likewise, IFNAR1(-/-) mice display an increased sensitivity to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, suggesting Type I IFN play a protective role during inflammation of the gut. Curiously, however, there have also been reports detailing the spontaneous development of IBD in patients receiving systemic IFN-beta therapy for multiple sclerosis or hepatitis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To investigate the effects of local administration of IFN-beta on a murine model of colitis, we developed a transgenic Lactobacillus acidophilus strain that constitutively expresses IFN-beta (La-IFN-beta). While pretreatment of mice with control Lactobacillus (La-EV) provided slight protective benefits, La-IFN-beta increased sensitivity to DSS. Analysis showed colitic mice pretreated with La-IFN-beta had increased production of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-17A and IL-13 by intestinal tissues and decreased regulatory T cells (Tregs) in their small intestine. Examination of CD103(+) dendritic cells (DCs) in the Peyer's patches revealed that IFNAR1 expression was dramatically reduced by La-IFN-beta. Similarly, bone marrow-derived DCs matured with La-IFN-beta experienced a 3-fold reduction of IFNAR1 and were impaired in their ability to induce Tregs. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our IFNAR1 expression data identifies a correlation between the loss/downregulation of IFNAR1 on DCs and exacerbation of colitis. Our data show that Lactobacillus secreting IFN-beta has an immunological effect that in our model results in the exacerbation of colitis. This study underscores that the selection of therapeutics delivered by a bacterial vehicle must take into consideration the simultaneous effects of the vehicle itself.
TI  - Starvation induces physiological changes that act on the cryotolerance of Lactobacillus acidophilus RD758.
AB  - The relationship between lactose starvation and cryotolerance was investigated in Lactobacillus acidophilus RD758. Cryotolerance was measured from the acidification activity of cells recovered after 18-h lactose starvation. It was compared to that of nonstarved cells, both of them in a stationary phase and in the same medium. This measurement allowed quantifying the initial acidification activity before freezing, as well as the loss of acidification activity during freezing and the rate of loss during frozen storage. Even if initial acidification activity was similar for nonstarved and starved bacteria, the latter displayed a significantly better resistance to freezing and frozen storage at -20 degrees C. To investigate the mechanisms that triggered these cryotolerance phenomena, the membrane fatty acid composition was determined by gas chromatography, and the proteome was established by 2-D electrophoresis, for starved and nonstarved cells. The main outcome was that the improved cryotolerance of starved cells was ascribed to two types of physiological responses as a result of starvation. The first one corresponded to an increased synthesis of unsaturated, cyclic, and branched fatty acids, to the detriment of saturated fatty acids, thus corresponding to enhanced membrane fluidity. The second response concerned the upregulation of proteins involved in carbohydrate and energy metabolisms and in pH homeostasis, allowing the cells to be better prepared for counteracting the stress they encountered during subsequent cold stress. These two phenomena led to a cross-protection phenomenon, which allowed better cryotolerance of Lb. acidophilus RD758, following cellular adaptation by starvation.
TI  - Upregulation of P-glycoprotein by probiotics in intestinal epithelial cells and in the dextran sulfate sodium model of colitis in mice.
AB  - P-glycoprotein (P-gp) mediates efflux of xenobiotics and bacterial toxins from the intestinal mucosa into the lumen. Dysregulation of P-gp has been implicated in inflammatory bowel disease. Certain probiotics have been shown to be effective in treating inflammatory bowel disease. However, direct effects of probiotics on P-gp are not known. Current studies examined the effects of Lactobacilli on P-gp function and expression in intestinal epithelial cells. Caco-2 monolayers and a mouse model of dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis were utilized. P-gp activity was measured as verapamil-sensitive [(3)H]digoxin transepithelial flux. Multidrug resistant 1 (MDR1)/P-gp expression was measured by real-time quantitative PCR and immunoblotting. Culture supernatant (CS; 1:10 or 1:50, 24 h) of Lactobacillus acidophilus or Lactobacillus rhamnosus treatment of differentiated Caco-2 monolayers (21 days postplating) increased ( approximately 3-fold) MDR1/P-gp mRNA and protein levels. L. acidophilus or L. rhamnosus CS stimulated P-gp activity ( approximately 2-fold, P < 0.05) via phosphoinositide 3-kinase and ERK1/2 MAPK pathways. In mice, L. acidophilus or L. rhamnosus treatment (3 x 10(9) colony-forming units) increased mdr1a/P-gp mRNA and protein expression in the ileum and colon (2- to 3-fold). In the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model (3% DSS in drinking water for 7 days), the degree of colitis as judged by histological damage and myeloperoxidase activity was reduced by L. acidophilus. L. acidophilus treatment to DSS-treated mice blocked the reduced expression of mdr1a/P-gp mRNA and protein in the distal colon. These findings suggest that Lactobacilli or their soluble factors stimulate P-gp expression and function under normal and inflammatory conditions. These data provide insights into a novel mechanism involving P-gp upregulation in beneficial effects of probiotics in intestinal inflammatory disorders.
TI  - Is Bifidobacterium breve effective in the treatment of childhood constipation? Results from a pilot study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics are increasingly used in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders. Studies in constipated adults with a Bifidus yoghurt (containing Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium bifidum and Lactobacillus acidophilus) showed a significant increase in defecation frequency. The aim of this pilot study was to determine if Bifidobacterium breve is effective in the treatment of childhood constipation. METHODS: Children, 3 to 16 years of age, with functional constipation according to the Rome III criteria were eligible for this study. During 4 weeks, children received one sachet of powder daily, containing 108- 1010 CFU Bifidobacterium breve. Furthermore, children were instructed to try to defecate on the toilet for 5-10 minutes after each meal and to complete a standardized bowel diary daily. The primary outcome measure was change in defecation frequency. Secondary outcome measures were stool consistency using the Bristol stool scale frequency of episodes of faecal incontinence, pain during defecation, frequency of abdominal pain, frequency of adverse effects (nausea, diarrhoea and bad taste), and frequency of intake of bisacodyl. RESULTS: Twenty children (75% male, mean age 7.4) were included in this pilot study. The defecation frequency per week significantly increased from 0.9 (0-2) at baseline to 4.9 (0-21) in week 4 (p < 0.01). The mean stool consistency score increased from 2.6 (2-4) at baseline to 3.5 (1-6) in week 4 (p = 0.03). The number of faecal incontinence episodes per week significantly decreased from 9.0 (0-35) at baseline to 1.5 (0-7) in week 4 (p < 0.01). Abdominal pain episodes per week significantly decreased from 4.2 (0-7) at baseline to 1.9 (0-7) in week 4 (p = 0.01). No side effects occurred. CONCLUSION: Bifidobacterium breve is effective in increasing stool frequency in children with functional constipation. Furthermore it has a positive effect with respect to stool consistency, decreasing the number of faecal incontinence episodes and in diminishing abdominal pain. A randomized placebo controlled trial is required to confirm these data.
TI  - The effect of a probiotic strain (Lactobacillus acidophilus) on the plaque formation of oral Streptococci.
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the ability of biofilm formation among mutans and non mutans oral streptococci and to determine the effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus DSM 20079 as a probiotic strain on the adhesion of selected streptococcal strains on the surfaces. The sample comprised 40 isolates of oral streptococci from dental plaque and caries of volunteer persons. Streptococcus mutans ATCC35668 (no24) was as an standard strain. The probiotic strain was Lactobacillus acidophilus DSM 20079. The ability of biofilm formation was investigated with colorimetric method and the strongest isolates were selected. Then the effect of probiotic strain on the adhesion of streptococci isolates was determined in polystyrene microtiter plate simultaneously and 30 minutes before streptococci entrance to the system. The results showed that 42% of mutans streptococci were strongly adherent (SA) and in non mutans streptococci, only 23.5% of isolates were found strongly adherent. The strong biofilm forming bacterium isolated was Streptococcus mutans strain22. In the next step, in the presence of probiotic strain the streptococcal adhesion were reduced, and this reduction was non significantly stronger if the probiotic strain was inoculated to the system before the oral bacteria. The Lactobacillus acidophilus had more effect on adherence of mutans streptococci than non mutans streptococci with significant difference (p < 0.05). Adhesion reduction is likely due to bacterial interactions and colonization of adhesion sites with probiotic strain before the presence of streptococci. Adhesion reduction can be an effective way on decreasing cariogenic potential of oral streptococci.
TI  - Effect of supplementation of micronutrients and phytochemicals to fructooligosaccharides on growth response of probiotics and E. coli.
AB  - Probiotics and prebiotics, which can change the colonic microenvironment, are the areas of current interest. Unutilizable fractions of the foods and fortificants, which reach the colon can affect the profile of probiotics. Effects of eight such factors viz. zinc sulphate, zinc carbonate, ferrous sulphate, ferric citrate, quercetin, gallic acid, phytic acid, and oxalic acid were, therefore, investigated on 24 H growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus (L1) and Lactobacillus plantarum (L2), two isolates of bifidobacteria (longum (L3) and bifidum (L4)) and a marketed consortium (L5) of eight probiotic cultures. MRS medium with marketed fructooligosaccharide as the only source of carbon was used for study of dose response curves. Quercetin and zinc sulphate showed significant positive effect for L1 and L5 (P < 0.01), whereas there was slight positive effect or no effect on growth of other probiotics. Phytic acid showed a significant inhibitory effect for L2 and a slight inhibitory effect on L3 and L4 whereas L5 were able to tolerate phytic acid. Oxalic acid had slight positive effect for L1 (P < 0.05) and L5 and no effect on growth of other probiotics (P > 0.05). Further, zinc sulphate, ferrous sulphate, quercetin, and oxalic acid significantly inhibited growth of E. coli (P < 0.05)
TI  - The effect of xylitol on the composition of the oral flora: a pilot study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the microbial composition of plaque and saliva. METHODS: Twelve volunteers (22-38 yrs) harboring mutans streptococci (MS) participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. The experimental chewing gum contained 65% xylitol while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol and 2% maltitol w/w. The polyol dose was approximately 6 g/day. Stimulated saliva and plaque samples were collected before and after the two four-week test periods. The samples were cultured for MS, total streptococci, lactobacilli, and total facultatives. A part of the samples were subjected to DNA-DNA hybridizations of 14 microbial plaque species: Actinomyces naeslundii, A. viscosus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. fermentum, L. paracasei, L. rhamnose, L. plantarum, Streptococcus gordonii, S. oralis, S. parasanguis, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis, Veillonella parvula. RESULTS: The MS counts of the plaque samples collected from "caries-prone" tooth sites decreased significantly (P<.01) in the xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. Also the plaque MS percentage decreased significantly in the xylitol gum group (P<.01). The salivary MS counts did not decrease either in the xylitol or in the sorbitol gum groups. Nor were changes detected in the salivary levels of total streptococci or lactobacilli. The DNA-DNA hybridization assay revealed no study-induced changes in the microbial composition of the dental plaque. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this pilot study, xylitol consumption reduced MS counts in plaque but appeared not to affect the microbial composition of plaque or saliva in general.
TI  - Co-aggregation and growth inhibition of probiotic lactobacilli and clinical isolates of mutans streptococci: an in vitro study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Co-aggregation and growth inhibition abilities of probiotic bacteria may play a key role in their interference with the oral biofilm. The aim was to investigate the in vitro ability of selected commercial probiotic lactobacilli to co-aggregate and inhibit growth of oral mutans steptococci isolated from adults with contrasting levels of caries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mutans streptococci (MS) strains were isolated from caries-free (n = 3) and caries-susceptible (n = 5) young adults and processed with eight commercial probiotic lactobacilli strains. One laboratory reference strain (S. mutans Ingbritt) was selected as control. Co-aggregation was determined spectrophotometrically and growth inhibition was assessed with the agar overlay technique. RESULTS: All probiotic lactobacilli showed an ability to co-aggregate with the isolated MS strains. Statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were found between strains from different individuals when compared with the reference strain. The selected lactobacilli inhibited MS growth, but the ability varied between the strains and was clearly related to pH. No differences were observed between the different MS strains from caries-free and caries-susceptible individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The selected lactobacilli displayed co-aggregation activity and inhibited growth of clinical mutans streptococci. The growth inhibition was strain-specific and dependent on pH and cell concentration. The findings indicate that the outcome of lactobacilli-derived probiotic therapy might vary between individuals and depend on the specific strain used.
TI  - Diversity and metabolic impact of intestinal Lactobacillus species in healthy adults and the elderly.
AB  - The present study aimed at assessing the counts and species distribution of intestinal lactobacilli and exploring if the data are associated with BMI and blood glucose level in healthy adults and elderly persons. The BMI (P < 0.01), the level of fasting blood glucose (P < 0.001) and the total counts of lactobacilli (P < 0.01 by bacteriology; P < 0.001 by real-time PCR) were higher in the elderly. The number of species in adults was lower (P < 0.05), who were more often colonised with Lactobacillus acidophilus (P = 0.031) and L. helveticus (P < 0.001). In contrast, L. plantarum (P = 0.035), L. paracasei (P < 0.001) and L. reuteri (P = 0.031) were more prevalent in the elderly. L. rhamnosus was detected in adults (P < 0.001), but not in any elderly person. BMI was associated with counts of lactobacilli, adjusted for age and sex (P = 0.008). The higher BMI in both groups of persons was associated with the presence of obligate homofermentative lactobacilli and L. sakei, both adjusted for age and sex. Plasma glucose values were positively correlated with BMI and negatively correlated with colonisation with L. paracasei (P = 0.0238) in adults and on the borderline with L. fermentum (P = 0.052) in the elderly. Thus, the species-specific PCR analysis of Lactobacillus sp. combined with viable plating data indicates substantial age-related structural differences in the intestinal lactobacilli communities. The higher counts of intestinal Lactobacillus sp. are associated with higher BMI and blood glucose content, while their specific fermentative groups and species of lactobacilli appear at different glucose levels both in adults and in the elderly.
TI  - Immunomodulatory effect of probiotics enriched diets on Uronema marinum infected  olive flounder.
AB  - The effect of five probiotics, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus sakei, Bacillus subtilis, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae as individual and mixed enriched diet on the seasonal prevalence, activity and intensity of Uronema marinum infection in olive flounder Paralichthys olivaceus is reported. The growth performance, feed efficiency, blood biochemistry, survival rate, and non-specific immune response of U. marinum infected olive flounder on week 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 were quantified. The prevalence and infection intensity reached a peak from June to December and then it declined from December to March. The scuticocidal activity in the serum was significantly higher when fed with L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, and S. cerevisiae diets on weeks 2-8. All enriched diets significantly enhanced the weight gain significantly between week 6 and 8; the feed efficiency registered a significantly increase from week 4 to 8 when compared to infected fish fed with control diet. Infected fish fed with L. plantarum-supplemented diet had higher survival rate than with other enriched diets. The serum aspartate aminotransferase (GOT) and alanine aminotransferase (GPT) levels significantly increased when fed with L. plantarum, L. acidophilus or S. cerevisiae-supplemented diet. Total protein (TP) and glucose (GLU) level significantly increased with any enriched diet from week 4 to 8. The superoxide anion production and serum lysozyme activity registered a significant increase when fed with L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, and S. cerevisiae-supplemented diet from week 4-8. The present study concludes that L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, and S. cerevisiae-supplemented diets act as immunostimulants enhancing the growth, feed efficiency, blood biochemistry, survival rate, and non-specific immune response in U. marinum infected olive flounder.
TI  - Impact of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 and, Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5-containing yoghurt, on fecal bacterial counts of healthy adults.
AB  - This randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, parallel dose-response study investigated the impact of 4-week commercial yoghurt consumption supplemented with Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (BB-12) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA-5) on fecal bacterial counts of healthy adults. Fifty-eight volunteers were randomly assigned to three different groups: 1. placebo (no probiotic, no starter and no green tea extract); 2. Yoptimal (10(9)cfu/100g of BB-12 and LA-5 and 40mg of green tea extract) and 3. Yoptimal-10 (10(10)cfu/100g of BB-12, 10(9)cfu/100g of LA-5 and 40mg of green tea extract). These yoghurt products also contained Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (10(7)cfu/100g) and Streptococcus thermophilus (10(10)cfu/100g). The quantitative PCR (qPCR) results showed that there were significant increases (P=0.02) in bifidobacteria counts with the Yoptimal treatment as compared to baseline. The fecal numbers of B. animalis subsp. lactis and LA-5 significantly increased in the two probiotic treatments compared to the placebo treatment. Viable counts of fecal lactobacilli were significantly higher (P=0.05) and those of enterococci were significantly lower (P=0.04) after the intervention when compared to placebo. No significant difference was observed between treatments in volunteers' weight, waist girth, blood pressure, fasting plasma triglyceride and HDL-C concentrations, as well as cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio. However, a significant increase in plasma cholesterol levels was observed in the placebo group (P=0.0018) but the levels remained stable in the two probiotic yoghurt groups. These results show that probiotic strains supplemented in the form of yoghurt remain active during gut transit and are associated with an increase in beneficial bacteria and a reduction in potentially pathogenic bacteria. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00730626.
TI  - Regulation of induced colonic inflammation by Lactobacillus acidophilus deficient in lipoteichoic acid.
AB  - Imbalance in the regulatory immune mechanisms that control intestinal cellular and bacterial homeostasis may lead to induction of the detrimental inflammatory signals characterized in humans as inflammatory bowel disease. Induction of proinflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-12) induced by dendritic cells (DCs) expressing pattern recognition receptors may skew naive T cells to T helper 1 polarization, which is strongly implicated in mucosal autoimmunity. Recent studies show the ability of probiotic microbes to treat and prevent numerous intestinal disorders, including Clostridium difficile-induced colitis. To study the molecular mechanisms involved in the induction and repression of intestinal inflammation, the phosphoglycerol transferase gene that plays a key role in lipoteichoic acid (LTA) biosynthesis in Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM (NCK56) was deleted. The data show that the L. acidophilus LTA-negative in LTA (NCK2025) not only down-regulated IL-12 and TNFalpha but also significantly enhanced IL-10 in DCs and controlled the regulation of costimulatory DC functions, resulting in their inability to induce CD4(+) T-cell activation. Moreover, treatment of mice with NCK2025 compared with NCK56 significantly mitigated dextran sulfate sodium and CD4(+)CD45RB(high)T cell-induced colitis and effectively ameliorated dextran sulfate sodium-established colitis through a mechanism that involves IL-10 and CD4(+)FoxP3(+) T regulatory cells to dampen exaggerated mucosal inflammation. Directed alteration of cell surface components of L. acidophilus NCFM establishes a potential strategy for the treatment of inflammatory intestinal disorders.
TI  - Acne vulgaris, probiotics and the gut-brain-skin axis - back to the future?
AB  - Over 70 years have passed since dermatologists John H. Stokes and Donald M. Pillsbury first proposed a gastrointestinal mechanism for the overlap between depression, anxiety and skin conditions such as acne. Stokes and Pillsbury hypothesized that emotional states might alter the normal intestinal microflora, increase intestinal permeability and contribute to systemic inflammation. Among the remedies advocated by Stokes and Pillsbury were Lactobacillus acidophilus cultures. Many aspects of this gut-brain-skin unifying theory have recently been validated. The ability of the gut microbiota and oral probiotics to influence systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, glycemic control, tissue lipid content and even mood itself, may have important implications in acne. The intestinal microflora may also provide a twist to the developing diet and acne research. Here we provide a historical perspective to the contemporary investigations and clinical implications of the gut-brain-skin connection in acne.
TI  - Survivability of probiotics encapsulated in alginate gel microbeads using a novel impinging aerosols method.
AB  - Encapsulation of probiotic bacteria in cross-linked alginate beads is of major interest for improving the survivability in harsh acid and bile environment and also in food matrices. Alginate micro beads (10-40 mum) containing the probiotics Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM were produced by a novel technique based on dual aerosols of alginate solution and CaCl(2) cross linking solution. Extruded macro beads (approximately 2mm diameter) produced by the conventional method and micro beads produced by novel aerosols technique offered comparable protection to L. rhamnosus in high acid and bile environment. Chitosan coating of micro beads resulted in a significant increase in survival time of L. rhamnosus from 40 to 120 min in acid condition and the reduction in cell numbers was confined to 0.94 log over this time. Alginate macro beads are more effective than micro beads in protecting L. acidophilus against high acid and bile. Chitosan coating of micro beads resulted in similar protection to L. acidophilus in macro beads in acid and extended the survival time from 90 to at least 120 min. Viability of this organism in micro beads was 3.5 log after 120 min. The continuous processing capability and scale-up potential of the dual aerosol technique offers potential for an efficient encapsulation of probiotics in very small alginate micro beads below sensorial detection limits while still being able to confer effective protection in acid and bile environment.
TI  - Probiotic cheese containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 and Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM(R) modifies subpopulations of fecal lactobacilli and Clostridium difficile in the elderly.
AB  - Aging is associated with alterations in the intestinal microbiota and with immunosenescence. Probiotics have the potential to modify a selected part of the intestinal microbiota as well as improve immune functions and may, therefore, be particularly beneficial to elderly consumers. In this randomized, controlled cross-over clinical trial, we assessed the effects of a probiotic cheese containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 and Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM on the intestinal microbiota and fecal immune markers of 31 elderly volunteers and compared these effects with the administration of the same cheese without probiotics. The probiotic cheese was found to increase the number of L. rhamnosus and L. acidophilus NCFM in the feces, suggesting the survival of the strains during the gastrointestinal transit. Importantly, probiotic cheese administration was associated with a trend towards lower counts of Clostridium difficile in the elderly, as compared with the run-in period with the plain cheese. The effect was statistically significant in the subpopulation of the elderly who harbored C. difficile at the start of the study. The probiotic cheese was not found to significantly alter the levels of the major microbial groups, suggesting that the microbial changes conferred by the probiotic cheese were limited to specific bacterial groups. Despite that the administration of the probiotic cheese to the study population has earlier been shown to significantly improve the innate immunity of the elders, we did not observe measurable changes in the fecal immune IgA concentrations. No increase in fecal calprotectin and beta-defensin concentrations suggests that the probiotic treatment did not affect intestinal inflammatory markers. In conclusion, the administration of probiotic cheese containing L. rhamnosus HN001 and L. acidophilus NCFM, was associated with specific changes in the intestinal microbiota, mainly affecting specific subpopulations of intestinal lactobacilli and C. difficile, but did not have significant effects on the major microbial groups or the fecal immune markers.
TI  - Heat-killed Lactobacillus acidophilus La205 enhances NK cell cytotoxicity through increased granule exocytosis.
AB  - Heat-killed lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are known to be important immunomodulators that stimulate tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and nitric oxide (NO) production as well as increase phagocytic activity in macrophages. NK cells play a critical role in innate immune response and induce spontaneous killing of tumor cells and virus-infected cells. However, the effect of heat-killed LAB on NK cells is still unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of heat-killed Lactobacillus acidophilus La205 (La205) on NK cytolytic activity. We found that heat-killed La205 directly stimulated NK cytolytic activity in dose- and time-dependent manners. To determine the mechanism underlying heat-killed La205-enhanced NK cytotoxicity, the expression of NK activating receptors was tested. Heat-killed La205 did not affect the expression of NK activating receptors. To investigate whether NK degranulation is related to heat-killed La205-enhanced NK cytotoxicity, NK degranulation inhibitor concanamycin A (CMA) was used. CMA effectively blocked heat-killed La205-induced NK cytotoxicity, and an assay for detection of a degranulation marker, CD107a, showed that heat-killed La205 increased granule exocytosis approximately 2-fold in comparison to non-treated NK cells. In addition, heat-killed La205 dramatically elevated mRNA expression of granulysin, a component of the cytolytic granule contents, in NK cells. However, other granule contents, including perforin and granzymes, were not changed by heat-killed La205. From these data, we concluded that heat-killed La205 stimulated NK cytolytic activity through enhancement of granule exocytosis, and granulysin may be a critical mediator in heat-killed La205-induced granule exocytosis.
TI  - Beneficial effects of a synbiotic supplement on self-perceived gastrointestinal well-being and immunoinflammatory status of healthy adults.
AB  - The use of synbiotics as health promoters is still poorly defined, and human intervention studies are scarce. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of a commercialized synbiotic product containing Lactobacillus acidophilus La5, Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis Bb-12, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, Streptococcus thermophilus, and fructooligosaccharides on the self-reported gastrointestinal well-being and the immunoinflammatory status of healthy human subjects. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 20 women and 16 men (25-45 years old) received either three tablets per day of the synbiotic product (2.4 x 10(9) colony-forming units/day) or placebo during 6 weeks. Gastrointestinal symptoms and bowel habits were evaluated through a self-administered questionnaire. In those subjects suffering from any kind of digestive disturbance (mild dyspepsia, flatulence, postprandial bloating, constipation, etc.), improvements in symptoms after product consumption were also evaluated. Blood lymphocyte subsets, phagocytic activity, serum C-reactive protein, ceruloplasmin, and adhesion molecules concentrations were analyzed prior and after treatment. A significant improvement in overall self-reported gastrointestinal symptoms and bowel habit was found in the synbiotic group. A marginal effect of treatment (analysis of variance P = .050) was observed with L-selectin, which showed a significant decrease in the synbiotic group (P = .019). In addition, basal L-selectin levels correlated with final intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 levels (r = 0.468; P = .050), and basal ICAM-1 levels tended to correlate negatively with final L-selectin concentration (r = -0.457; P = .056). None of these correlations was found in the placebo group. The rest of the immunological parameters studied were not modified by the intervention. In conclusion, consumption of the synbiotic product improves self-perceived bowel habits and might facilitate a better profile of adhesion molecules in healthy adults.
TI  - Potent spermicidal effect of oleanolic acid 3-beta-D-glucuronide, an active principle isolated from the plant Sesbania sesban Merrill.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The spermicidal activity of oleanolic acid 3-beta-D-glucuronide (OAG), an active principle isolated from root extracts of Sesbania sesban, was evaluated. STUDY DESIGN: Under the Sander-Cramer test criteria, the sperm-immobilizing activity of OAG was studied using highly motile rat sperm. Sperm mortality and membrane integrity were assessed by supravital staining, hypo-osmotic swelling (HOS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and sperm membrane lipid peroxidation (LPO). In vitro microbicidal potential and hemolytic index of OAG were examined in Lactobacillus culture and rat red blood corpuscles (RBCs), respectively. Post-intravaginal OAG application, the in vivo contraceptive efficacy was evaluated in rats. Ames test determined the carcinogenic potential of OAG. RESULTS: The minimum effective concentration (MEC) of OAG was 50 mcg/mL. More than 97% of the OAG-treated sperm lost their HOS responsiveness in a dose-dependent manner. TEM and LPO revealed that OAG affected the sperm membrane integrity. OAG declined fertility to zero, was nonmutagenic and was not harmful to lactobacillus. CONCLUSION: OAG has significant spermicidal activity that may be explored further.
TI  - Selected aspects of the oral environment in cleft palate patients--a problem evidently beyond dentists' scope.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The oral cavity is a specialized ecosystem composed of dentition and mucosa exposed to the effects of saliva and gingival liquid. Its structure provides advantageous conditions for various microorganisms, both aerobic streptococci and anaerobic bacilli. The dynamic balance of the oral cavity ecosystem can be threatened by various factors. Lip and palatal clefts are the most frequent disorders in embryonic facial development. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus and oral cavity hygiene in patients with cleft palate treated orthodontically are significantly different compared with patients without these congenital malformations. MATERIAL/METHODS: The study group consisted of 200 patients aged 6-21 who were divided into two groups depending on the presence of cleft palate and treatment method. Group C (control) consisted of 50 orthodontically untreated patients with occlusal dental defects. The performed studies consisted of 2 parts: the clinical-laboratory part and statistical analysis. Clinical-laboratory part RESULTS: High bacteria levels of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus in saliva of patients were comparably frequent between groups, but there were statistically significant differences in inter-group comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: As the orthodontic treatment changes the oral environment, control of proper hygienic behavior is an essential element of health education. Introduction of preventive programs is also very important.
TI  - Characterization and transfer of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria from fermented food products.
AB  - The study provides phenotypic and molecular analyses of the antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from fermented foods in Xi'an, China. LAB strains (n = 84) belonging to 16 species of Lactobacillus (n = 73), and Streptococcus thermophilus (n = 11) were isolated and identified by sequencing their 16S rRNA gene. All strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, and cefsulodin, and intrinsically resistant to nalidixic acid, kanamycin, and vancomycin (except L. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, and S. thermophilus, which were susceptible to vancomycin). Some strains had acquired resistance for penicillin (n = 2), erythromycin (n = 9), clindamycin (n = 5), and tetracycline (n = 14), while resistance to gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol was species dependent. Minimum inhibitory concentrations presented in this study will help to review microbiological breakpoints for some of the species of Lactobacillus. The erm(B) gene was detected from two strains of each of L. fermentum and L. vaginalis, and one strain of each of L. plantarum, L. salivarius, L. acidophilus, L. animalis, and S. thermophilus. The tet genes were identified from 12 strains of lactobacilli from traditional foods. This is the first time, the authors identified tet(S) gene from L. brevis and L. kefiri. The erm(B) gene from L. fermentum NWL24 and L. salivarius NWL33, and tet(M) gene from L. plantarum NWL22 and L. brevis NWL59 were successfully transferred to Enterococcus faecalis 181 by filter mating. It was concluded that acquired antibiotic resistance is well dispersed in fermented food products in Xi'an, China and its transferability to other genera should be monitored closely.
TI  - Evaluation of Helicobacter pylori eradication by triple therapy plus Lactobacillus acidophilus compared to triple therapy alone.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of adding Lactobacillus acidophilus to a triple regimen for Helicobacter pylori eradication in untreated patients with peptic ulcers or ulcer-scars. This was a pre-randomized, single-blind, interventional, treatment-efficacy study with active controls and parallel-assignment, set in Coimbra, Portugal, on 62 consecutive H. pylori-positive untreated adults with peptic ulcers or ulcer-scars, diagnosed by gastroduodenoscopy, with pre-treatment direct Gram-staining and culture of gastric biopsies. The first 31 patients received esomeprazole 20 mg, amoxicillin 1000 mg and clarithromycin 500 mg (EAC), all b.i.d., for 8 days. The remaining 31 added L. acidophilus, 5 x 10(9) organisms per capsule, 3 + 2 i.d. for 8 days (EACL). The main outcome measure was (13)C urea breath test (UBT), >/=6 weeks after completion of therapy. Successful eradication (UBT-negativity after treatment), was similar in both groups (EAC = 80.6%; EACL = 83.9%, p = 0.740) by both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis. The non-eradicated strains were susceptible in vitro to both antibiotics. Adding L. acidophilus to EAC triple therapy did not increase H. pylori eradication rates. Considering the cost and the burden of ingesting five extra capsules daily, supplementing the EAC therapy with L. acidophilus, at this dose, shows no benefit. Further studies with different dosages and duration of treatment, and other probiotics or probiotic combinations are required to improve eradication.
TI  - Predominant genera of fecal microbiota in children with atopic dermatitis are not altered by intake of probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bi-07.
AB  - The effect of probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and Bifidobacterium lactis Bi-07 on the composition of the Lactobacillus group, Bifidobacterium and the total bacterial population in feces from young children with atopic dermatitis was investigated. The study included 50 children randomized to intake of one of the probiotic strain or placebo. Microbial composition was characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, quantitative PCR and, in a subset of subjects, by pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The core population of the Lactobacillus group was identified as Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus oris, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, while the bifidobacterial community included Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum and Bifidobacterium catenulatum. The fecal numbers of L. acidophilus and B. lactis increased significantly after intervention, indicating survival of the ingested bacteria. The levels of Bifidobacterium correlated positively (P=0.03), while the levels of the Lactobacillus group negatively (P=0.01) with improvement of atopic eczema evaluated by the Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis index. This correlation was observed across the whole study cohort and not attributed to the probiotic intake. The main conclusion of the study is that administration of L. acidophilus NCFM and B. lactis Bi-07 does not affect the composition and diversity of the main bacterial populations in feces.
TI  - In vitro fermentation of rice bran combined with Lactobacillus acidophilus 14 150B or Bifidobacterium longum 05 by the canine faecal microbiota.
AB  - The fermentability of rice bran (RB), alone or in combination with one of two probiotics, by canine faecal microbiota was evaluated in stirred, pH-controlled, anaerobic batch cultures. RB enhanced the levels of bacteria detected by probes Bif164 (bifidobacteria) and Lab158 (lactic acid bacteria); however, addition of the probiotics did not have a significant effect on the predominant microbial counts compared with RB alone. RB sustained levels of Bifidobacterium longum 05 throughout the fermentation; in contrast, Lactobacillus acidophilus 14 150B levels decreased significantly after 5-h fermentation. RB fermentation induced changes in the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) profile. However, RB combined with probiotics did not alter the SCFA levels compared with RB alone. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of samples obtained at 24 h showed a treatment effect with RB, which was not observed in the RB plus probiotic systems. Overall, the negative controls displayed lower species richness than the treatment systems and their banding profiles were distinct. This study illustrates the ability of a common ingredient found in pet food to modulate the canine faecal microbiota and highlights that RB may be an economical alternative to prebiotics for use in dog food.
TI  - Effects of yogurt starter cultures on the survival of Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Recognized to confer health benefits to consumers, probiotics such as Lactobacillus acidophilus are commonly incorporated into fermented dairy products worldwide; among which yogurt is a popular delivery vehicle. To materialize most of the putative health benefits associated with probiotics, an adequate amount of viable cells must be delivered at the time of consumption. However, the loss in their viabilities during refrigerated storage has been demonstrated previously. This study focused on the effects of yogurt starter cultures on the survival of five strains of L. acidophilus, with emphases on low pH and acid production. Differential survival behavior between L. acidophilus strains was further analyzed. To this end, viable cell counts of L. acidophilus were determined weekly during 4 degrees C storage in various types of yogurts made with Streptococcus thermophilus alone, L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus alone, both species of the starter cultures, or glucono-delta-lactone (GDL). All yogurt types, except for pasteurized yogurts, were co-fermented with L. acidophilus. Yogurt filtrate was analyzed for the presence of any inhibitory substance and for the amount of hydrogen peroxide. Multiplication of L. acidophilus was not affected by the starter cultures as all strains reached high level on day 0 of the storage period. Throughout the 28-day storage period, cell counts of L. acidophilus PIM703 and SBT2062 remained steady (~6 x 10(7)CFU/g) in yogurts made with both starter cultures, whereas those of ATCC 700396 and NCFM were reduced by a maximum of 3 and 4.6 logs, respectively. When starter cultures were replaced by GDL, all strains survived well, suggesting that a low pH was not a critical factor dictating their survival. In addition, the filtrate collected from yogurts made with starter cultures appeared to have higher inhibitory activities against L. acidophilus than that made with GDL. The presence of viable starter cultures was necessary to adversely affect the survival of some strains, as pasteurized yogurts had no effect on their survival. In particular, the inhibitory effect exerted by L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus on L. acidophilus NCFM was highly pronounced than by S. thermophilus, nevertheless, the same effect was not observed on SBT2062. The inhibition against stationary-phase NCFM cells might be caused by the elevated level of hydrogen peroxide produced by L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. Delineating factors driving the differences in survival trait among probiotic strains will lead to a more efficacious delivery of health benefits in fermented dairy products through targeted technological interventions.
TI  - Phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. However, the phylogenetic relationships among LAB species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. RESULTS: We performed a phylogenetic analysis of LAB species based on 232 genes from 28 LAB genome sequences. Regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. The LAB species examined were divided into two groups. Group 1 included families Enterococcaceae and Streptococcaceae. Group 2 included families Lactobacillaceae and Leuconostocaceae. Within Group 2, the LAB species were divided into two clades. One clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus Lactobacillus and two other species, Lb. sakei and Lb. casei. In the acidophilus complex, Lb. delbrueckii separated first, while Lb. acidophilus/Lb. helveticus and Lb. gasseri/Lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. The other clade within Group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, Lb. salivarius, Lb. plantarum, Lb. brevis, Lb. reuteri, Lb. fermentum, and the genera Pediococcus, Oenococcus, and Leuconostoc. In this clade, Lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to Lb. plantarum/Lb. brevis pair and Pediococcus, and the other including Oenococcus/Leuconostoc pair and Lb. reuteri/Lb. fermentum pair. In addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be more useful than others. The genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (TRSB), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein B (uvrB), DNA polymerase III (polC) and penicillin binding protein 2B (pbpB). CONCLUSIONS: Our phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of LAB species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. We infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in LAB species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. Further analyses of more genes from additional, representative LAB species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of LAB species to various environmental niches.
TI  - Use of lactobacilli and estriol combination in the treatment of disturbed vaginal ecosystem: a review.
AB  - To maintain a healthy vaginal ecosystem or to restore any disturbance, sufficient estrogen levels, an intact mature vaginal epithelium, and physiological lactobacillary microflora are essential. Thus, a combination of beneficial lactobacilli and estrogen is an appealing treatment option. This article reviews the published data on the use of viable Lactobacillus acidophilus KS400 and a low dose of estriol (0.03 mg E3) in the form of vaginal tablets (Gynoflor(R)). In vitro studies demonstrated that L. acidophilus KS400 produces lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), inhibits the growth of relevant vaginal pathogens, and inhibits adherence of pathogens to epithelial cells. Topical administration of E3 for treatment of vaginal diseases is generally preferred, as this route of application of hormones produces a more significant local proliferative response and has no stimulating effect on the endometrium. Overall, 16 clinical studies have been published with the combination of L. acidophilus KS400 and 0.03 mg E3. The results of these trials have demonstrated that the combination improves the vaginal epithelium and the restoration of the lactobacillary microflora with an excellent safety profile, even during pregnancy. The combination can be used in pre- and postmenopausal women for the restoration of the vaginal flora after anti-infective therapy, for treatment of symptomatic vaginal atrophy, and for abnormal vaginal flora therapy. It can be also considered in repetitive therapy courses for the long-term prevention of recurrences of bacterial vaginosis, even though further clinical studies are needed to substantiate the benefit of this application.
TI  - Lactobacillus Acidophilus-Derived Biosurfactant Effect on GTFB and GTFC Expression Level in Streptococcus Mutans Biofilm Cells.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans), harboring biofilm formation, considered as a main aetiological factor of dental caries. Gtf genes play an important role in S. mutans biofilm formation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus-derived biosurfactant on S. mutans biofilm formation and gtfB/C expression level (S. mutans standard strain ATCC35668 and isolated S. mutans strain (22) from dental plaque). The Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) DSM 20079 was selected as a probiotic strain to produce biosurfactant. The FTIR analysis of its biosurfactant showed that it appears to have a protein-like component. Due to the release of such biosurfactants, L. acidophilus was able to interfere in the adhesion and biofilm formation of the S. mutans to glass slide. It also could make streptococcal chains shorter. Using realtime RT-PCR quantitation method made it clear that gtfB and gtfC gene expression were decreased in the presence of L. acidophilus-derived biosurfactant fraction. Several properties of S. mutans cells (the surface properties, biofilm formation, adhesion ability and gene expression) were changed after L. acidophilus- derived biosurfactant treatment. It is also concluded that biosurfacant treatment can provide an optional way to control biofilm development. On the basis of our findings, we can suggest that the prepared biosurfactant may interfere with adhesion processes of S. mutans to teeth surfaces, provided additional evaluation produce satisfactory results.
TI  - Correlation between api 50 ch and multiplex polymerase chain reaction for the identification of vaginal lactobacilli in isolates.
AB  - Identification of Lactobacillus sp. strains by phenotypic methods may lead to doubtful results possibly interfering in the reliability of the epidemiological and probiotics studies. Therefore this study aimed to determine the best methodology for the identification of the large diversity of lactobacilli species found in the vagina by comparing two techniques, one based on their biochemical profile and other employing molecular biology. A carbohydrate fermentation test (API 50 CH) was compared with multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the identification of species of vaginal lactobacilli from 135 healthy women. The kappa index was used to evaluate agreement between the methods. Using the molecular technique, L. crispatus (32.6%), L. jensenii (25%) and L. gasseri (20.6%) were the most frequent species. However, using the biochemical technique, the most frequent species were: L. acidophilus (34.8%), L. crispatus (27.2%) and L. fermentum (13%). Although L. acidophilus was the most frequent specie found by biochemical tests, no strain of this microorganism was detected by PCR. Agreement between the methods was low for identification of all the most common species. Although rates of L. crispatus detected were similar using both methods (32.6% and 27.2%), agreement between them was relatively low (kappa = 0.52). CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirmed the limitation of the biochemical method and the applicability of a previously published molecular method (Multiplex PCR) for the identification of lactobacilli in the vaginal tract, focusing on further necessity of its improvement for also targeting L. vaginalis and L. iners.
TI  - Comparative Analysis of two Component Signal Transduction Systems of the Lactobacillus Acidophilus Group.
AB  - The Lactobacillus acidophilus group is a phylogenetically distinct group of closely related lactobacilli. Members of this group are considered to have probiotic properties and occupy different environmental niches. Bacteria generally sense and respond to environmental changes through two component systems (TCSs) which consist of a histidine protein kinase (HPK) and its cognate response regulator (RR). With the use of in silico techniques, the five completely sequenced L. acidophilus group genomes were scanned in order to predict TCSs. Five to nine putative TCSs encoding genes were detected in individual genomes of the L. acidophilus group. The L. acidophilus group HPKs and RRs were classified into subfamilies using the Grebe and Stock classification method. Putative TCSs were analyzed with respect to conserved domains to predict biological functions. Putative biological functions were predicted for the L. acidophilus group HPKs and RRs by comparing them with those of other microorganisms. Some of TCSs were putatively involved in a wide variety of functions which are related with probiotic ability, including tolerance to acid and bile, production of antimicrobial peptides, resistibility to the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin, and oxidative condition.
TI  - [Effect of acidophilic multiprobiotic symbiter on pathological changes in bone periodontal tissue under hypo-acidic condition].
AB  - The omeprazole-induced hypoacidity leads to metabolic disorders in the bone periodontal tissue: a disbalance of NO-ergic system, activation of collagen and noncollagen proteins catabolism. We have shown that such disorders are corrected by a multiprobiotic of new generation -- symbiter acidophilic.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus as a live vehicle for oral immunization against chicken anemia virus.
AB  - The AcmA binding domains of Lactococcus lactis were used to display the VP1 protein of chicken anemia virus (CAV) on Lactobacillus acidophilus. One and two repeats of the cell wall binding domain of acmA gene were amplified from L. lactis MG1363 genome and then inserted into co-expression vector, pBudCE4.1. The VP1 gene of CAV was then fused to the acmA sequences and the VP2 gene was cloned into the second MCS of the same vector before transformation into Escherichia coli. The expressed recombinant proteins were purified using a His-tag affinity column and mixed with a culture of L. acidophilus. Whole cell ELISA and immunofluorescence assay showed the binding of the recombinant VP1 protein on the surface of the bacterial cells. The lactobacilli cells carrying the CAV VP1 protein were used to immunize specific pathogen-free chickens through the oral route. A moderate level of neutralizing antibody to CAV was detected in the serum of the immunized chickens. A VP1-specific proliferative response was observed in splenocytes of the chickens after oral immunization. The vaccinated groups also showed increased levels of Th1 cytokines interleukin (IL)-2, IL-12, and IFN-gamma. These observations suggest that L. acidophilus can be used in the delivery of vaccines to chickens.
TI  - Effects of multistrain probiotic-containing yogurt on second-line triple therapy  for Helicobacter pylori infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The adjuvant effects of probiotic-containing yogurt on second-line triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection have not been evaluated. METHODS: A total of 337 patients with persistent H. pylori infection, after first-line triple therapy, were randomly assigned to receive either triple therapy with (yogurt group, n=151) or without (control group, n=186) Will yogurt. Triple therapy consisted of 400 mg moxifloxacin q.d., 1000 mg amoxicillin b.i.d., and 20 mg esomeprazole b.i.d. for 14 days. Will yogurt contains Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Bifidobacterium longum, and Streptococcus thermophilus. H. pylori eradication was evaluated by the (13)C-urea breath test, histology, or the rapid urease test. RESULTS: The eradication rates by intention-to-treat analysis were 66.7% and 68.9% in the control and yogurt groups, respectively (P=0.667). The eradication rates by per-protocol analysis were 78.5% and 86% in the control and the yogurt groups, respectively (P=0.110). The adverse event rates were 25.3% and 28.5% in the control group and yogurt group, respectively (P=0.508). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of yogurt containing probiotics to moxifloxacin-containing second-line treatment neither improved H. pylori eradication rates nor reduced the adverse events of treatment.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria fermentation of human milk oligosaccharide components, human milk oligosaccharides and galactooligosaccharides.
AB  - Human milk contains about 7% lactose and 1% human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) consisting of lactose with linked fucose, N-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid. In infant formula, galactooligosaccharides (GOSs) are added to replace HMOs. This study investigated the ability of six strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus reuteri, Streptococcus thermophilus and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris, to digest HMO components, defined HMOs, and GOSs. All strains grew on lactose and glucose. N-acetylglucosamine utilization varied between strains and was maximal in L. plantarum; fucose utilization was low or absent in all strains. Both hetero- and homofermentative LAB utilized N-acetylglucosamine via the Embden-Meyerhof pathway. Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. plantarum were the most versatile in hydrolysing pNP analogues and the only strains releasing mono- and disaccharides from defined HMOs. Whole cells of all six LAB hydrolysed oNP-galactoside and pNP-galactoside indicating beta-galactosidase activity. High beta-galactosidase activity of L. reuteri, L. fermentum, S. thermophilus and L. mesenteroides subsp. cremoris whole cells correlated to lactose and GOS hydrolysis. Hydrolysis of lactose and GOSs by heterologously expressed beta-galactosidases confirmed that LAB beta-galactosidases are involved in GOS digestion. In summary, the strains of LAB used were not capable of utilizing complex HMOs but metabolized HMO components and GOSs.
TI  - Use of lactulose as prebiotic and its influence on the growth, acidification profile and viable counts of different probiotics in fermented skim milk.
AB  - Lactulose can be considered as a prebiotic, which is able to stimulate healthy intestinal microflora. In the present work, the use of this ingredient in fermented milk improved quality of skim milk fermented by Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Bifidobacterium lactis in co-culture with Streptococcus thermophilus. Compared to control fermentations without lactulose, the addition of such a prebiotic in skim milk increased the counts of all probiotics, with particular concern to B. lactis (bifidogenic effect), the acidification rate and the lactic acid acidity, and concurrently reduced the time to complete fermentation (t(pH4.5)) and the pH at the end of cold storage for 1 to 35 days.
TI  - Genome sequence of Lactobacillus amylovorus GRL1112.
AB  - Lactobacillus amylovorus is a common member of the normal gastrointestinal tract  (GIT) microbiota in pigs. Here, we report the genome sequence of L. amylovorus GRL1112, a porcine feces isolate displaying strong adherence to the pig intestinal epithelial cells. The strain is of interest, as it is a potential probiotic bacterium.
TI  - Host range of enterococcal vanA plasmids among Gram-positive intestinal bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The most prevalent type of acquired glycopeptide resistance is encoded by the vanA transposon Tn1546 located mainly on transferable plasmids in Enterococcus faecium. The limited occurrence in other species could be due to the lack of inter-species transferability and/or stability of Tn1546-containing plasmids in other species. We investigated the in vitro transferability of 14 pre-characterized vanA-containing plasmids hosted by E. faecium (n = 9), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 4) and Enterococcus raffinosus (n = 1) into several enterococcal, lactobacterial, lactococcal and bifidobacterial recipients. METHODS: A filter-mating protocol was harmonized using procedures of seven partner laboratories. Donor strains were mated with three E. faecium recipients, three E. faecalis recipients, a Lactobacillus acidophilus recipient, a Lactococcus lactis recipient and two Bifidobacterium recipients. Transfer rates were calculated per donor and recipient. Transconjugants were confirmed by determining their phenotypic and genotypic properties. Stability of plasmids in the new host was assessed in long-term growth experiments. RESULTS: In total, 282 enterococcal matings and 73 inter-genus matings were performed and evaluated. In summary, intra-species transfer was far more frequent than inter-species transfer, if that was detectable at all. All recipients of the same species behaved similarly. Inter-genus transfer was shown for broad host range control plasmids (pIP501/pAMbeta1) only. Acquired resistance plasmids remained stable in the new host. CONCLUSIONS: Intra-species transfer of enterococcal vanA plasmids was far more frequent than transfer across species or genus barriers and may thus explain the preferred prevalence of vanA-containing plasmids among E. faecium. A reservoir of vanA plasmids in non-enterococcal intestinal colonizers does not seem to be reasonable.
TI  - Modulation of Bax/Bcl-2 and caspases by probiotics during acetaminophen induced apoptosis in primary hepatocytes.
AB  - Oxidative stress is an important factor in drug induced hepatotoxicity and antioxidants from natural sources have potential to ameliorate it. The present study was aimed to investigate cyto-protective potential of probiotic Enterococcus lactis IITRHR1 (El(SN)) and Lactobacillus acidophilus MTCC447 (La(SN)) lysate against acetaminophen (APAP) induced hepatotoxicity. Cultured rat hepatocytes pretreated with El(SN)/La(SN) showed higher cell viability under APAP stress. Pre-treatment with El(SN,) restored glutathione level and reduced ROS generation significantly which are major biomarkers of oxidative stress. It also reduced NO level, MDA formation and enhanced SOD activity. Pre-treatment with probiotic lysates significantly inhibited the translocation of pro-apoptotic protein (Bax), enhanced anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) protein levels and prevented release of cyt c to cytosol; suggesting involvement of mitochondrial proteins in protection against APAP induced oxidative cellular damage. Loss in mitochondrial membrane potential due to APAP treatment was prevented in the presence of probiotic lysates. Protective action of El(SN)/La(SN) pretreatment was further supported by prevention of procaspase-3 activation, DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation, in turn inhibiting APAP induced apoptotic cell death. The results indicate that probiotic preparations modulate crucial end points of oxidative stress induced apoptosis and may be used for management of drug induced liver injury.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum stored at ambient temperature are effective in the treatment of acute diarrhoea.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Probiotics have demonstrated potential to reduce duration of diarrhoea and frequency of watery stools. Probiotics such as Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum (Infloran((R))) are usually maintained at a storage temperature of 4 degrees C which is generally not feasible in tropical or sub-tropical countries. AIM: The efficacy of Infloran((R)) for treatment of acute diarrhoea when stored at 28-32 degrees C (room temperature) was evaluated. METHODS: This was a double-blind, randomised study of infants and children aged 2 months to 7 years with acute diarrhoea. Patients were randomly assigned to receive Infloran((R)) stored at 4 degrees C, at room temperature, or to a placebo group. Duration of diarrhoea was a primary outcome, while the number of stools, hospital stay and requirement for rehydration fluid were secondary outcomes. RESULTS: Probiotics shortened duration of diarrhoea (34.1 and 34.8 hrs when stored either at 4 degrees C or at room temperature, respectively, and 58 hrs with placebo, p<0.01) and reduced the number of stools (7.3 and 8 vs 15.9 with placebo, p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Administration of probiotics is beneficial as additional treatment of acute diarrhoea and efficacy is not affected by storage temperature.
TI  - Therapeutic efficacy of Lactobacillus acidophilus against bacterial isolates from burn wounds.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics are live microorganisms which are mainly strains of Lactobacillus spp., Bifidobacterium spp. When administered in adequate amounts, these microorganisms offer a health benefit for the host. Probiotic organisms are also available commercially in milk, sour milk, ice cream and other foods. AIMS: To identify bacterial species isolated from burn wounds, and also to evaluate (In-vitro) the therapeutic efficacy of Lacto. acidophilus against these bacterial isolates. To compare this activity to other antibacterial agents which are used medically in the treatment of burn wound cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Burn wound swabs were obtained from 50 patients who had been admitted to hospitals in Baghdad during August to November 2009. These swabs were inoculated onto enriched and differential culture media. Subcultures were performed on selective media. The necessary biochemical tests were conducted and the organisms identified using standard procedures. Susceptibility of isolated pathogens to local isolates Lacto. Acidophilus (with 1x10(8) cells/mL) and 10 commonly used burn wounds antibiotics was examined using standard susceptibility testing. RESULTS: Ninety different organisms were isolated. Gram-positive cocci accounted for 16 (17.7%) and gram-negative bacilli for 74 (82.2%) bacterial isolates. Pseudomonas aeruginosa 30(33.3%) were the most commonly isolated organisms, followed by Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp.(22.2,20,4.4,2.2%), respectively. Staphylococcus aureus isolates were performed in 8(8.8%). However, the incidence of Staphylococcus epidermidis was 2 (2.2%), while ss-haemolytic Streptococci was 4(4.4%). In susceptibility testing, Lacto. acidophilus had coverage against 90 (100%) of 74 gram-negative and 16 of gram-positive bacteria tested. The coverage of the remaining 10 antibacterial agents used was different in their activity (resistance or sensitivity), which ranged between 50-100%. CONCLUSION: The results of the study concluded that lactobacillus acidophilus concentration of 1x10(8) cells/mL had a high activity to inhibit the growth in-vitro of all pathogenic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, which cause burn wound infections. This indicated the therapeutic efficacy of lactobacillus acidophilus bacteria.
TI  - Isoflavone phytoestrogens in soymilk fermented with beta-glucosidase producing probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Isoflavones significantly contribute to human health and disease prevention, and  exist as glucosides and aglycones. The beta-glucosidase enzyme that hydrolyzes glucosides to aglycones is very sensitive to molecular structure, and thus the profile of the isoflavones can affect their rate of hydrolysis. Soymilk was fermented with Lactobacillus acidophilus B4496 (La), Lactobacillus bulgaricus CFR2028 (Lb), Lactobacillus casei B1922 (Lc), Lactobacillus plantarum B4495 (Lp) and Lactobacillus fermentum B4655 (Lf) for 48 h at 37 degrees C. beta-Glucosidase activity was determined using p-nitrophenyl beta-D-glucopyranoside as a substrate and the hydrolysis was carried out in soymilk. During fermentation, maximum growth was seen at 24 h with Lb, Lc, Lp and Lf and at 48 h with La. Polyphenol content ranged from 12.98 to 17.90 at 24 h and from 12.44 to 15.24 mg/100 ml at 48 h of fermentation. All the lactic acid bacteria produced beta-glucosidase enzyme, which hydrolyzed isoflavone glucosides to aglycones at a significant level (P < 0.05) in the fermented soymilk.
TI  - [Effects of S-layer proteins from lactobacillus against Salmonella typhimurium adhesion and invasion on Caco-2 cells].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: S-layer proteins of Lactobacillus acidophilus were extracted and purified, then the effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus and its S-layer proteins against the adhesion and invasion of salmonella typhimurium to caco-2 cells were investigated. METHODS: S-layer proteins were purified by anion-exchange column {diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) DE52}, and the inhibition of Lactobacillus acidophilus and its S-layer proteins were studied against the adhesion and invasion of salmonella typhimurium on Caco-2 cells. RESULTS: S-layer proteins exhibited strongly inhibitory effects of adhesive and invading properties of Salmonella typhimurium. In the adhesive experiments (competitive, exclusive and displacement), Salmonella typhimurium adhesion was reduced by S-layer proteins and the ability of adherence to Caco-2 cells were 1.17% +/- 5.97%, 8.71% +/- 1.36% and 10.56% +/- 0.92%, respectively (P < 0.01). The influence to inhibit the competitive adhesion of Salmonella typhimurium was optimal. Furthermore, the S-layer proteins showed a stronger effect than Lactobacillus acidophilus to inhibit Salmonella typhimurium adhesion on Caco-2 monolayers (P < 0.01). Moreover, invasion of Salmonella typhimurium to Caco-2 monolayers was inhibited by S-layer proteins. CONCLUSION: S-layer proteins inhibited adherence and invasion of Salmonella typhimurium. The result can merit a highlight for preventive or probiotic therapy in human or animals with disease caused by Salmonella typhimurium.
TI  - [Classification of domestic probiotic cultures of Lactobacillus genus].
AB  - AIM: To study strains of bacteria from Lactobacillus genus using combination of microbiological and molecular biological methods in order to define more accurately their systematic position and biochemical characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen cultures of Lactobacillus bacteria isolated from stool of healthy persons were studied: L. plantarum CS 396, L. plantarum 8-PA-3, L. plantarum 421-2, L. fermentum 90-TC-4, L. delbrueckii gKNM 101, L. delbrueckii gKNM 526, L. acidophilus Er 317/402 NARINE, L. acidophilus 100 ash, L. acidophilus NK-1, L. acidophilus NNIE, L. acidophilus K3sh24, L. brevis gKNM 23 11, L. casei gKNM 577. Their enzymatic activity relative to 50 sugars was studied using API-50 system. Structure of proximal region of 16S rRNA gene was studied also. RESULTS: According to results of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis strains were divided on 2 groups: 1) L. casei gKNM 577, L. plantarum 8-PA-3, L. plantarum CS 396, which species belonging corresponded to stated description. Comparison of nucleotide sequence of 16S rRNA gene of group 2 strains with nucleotide sequences database revealed that cultures NK-1, Er315/402 NARINE, 100 ash, NNIE identified early as L. acidophilus belong to species L. helveticus; L. brevis gKNM 23 and L. acidophilus K3sh24--to group L. casei/paracasei, L. delbrueckii gKNM 101 and L. fermentum 90-TC-4--to L. plantarum, L. delbrueckii gKNM 526--to L. fermentum, and L. plantarum 421-2--to L. rhamnosus. CONCLUSION: Obtained data allowed to perform taxonomic reclassification of species belonging of studied probiotic cultures of lactobacilli according to modem level of systematic of bacteria.
TI  - Probiotic yogurt effects on intestinal flora of patients with chronic liver disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic liver disease generally have intestinal flora imbalance that is related to the development and worsening of the disease. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of probiotic yogurt on intestinal flora of patients with chronic liver disease. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial, pretest-posttest control group design, was used. Patients were randomized to an experimental group (41 patients) or a control group (40 patients). Patients in the experimental group were given probiotic yogurt (one cup each time, three times per day for 14 days) containing Bacillus bifidus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus within 2 hours after meals. Levels of fecal flora, symptoms and signs, and laboratory examination indexes were collected. RESULTS: After intervention, the experimental group had a lower Escherichia coli count and reduced intestinal flora imbalance (p < .05). Comparison of the experimental and control groups after the intervention showed that the former had improved symptoms and signs, including significant improvement in debilitation, food intake, appetite, abdominal distension, and ascitic fluid (p < .05). CONCLUSION: Probiotic yogurt reduces the levels of intestinal flora imbalance and has an additional therapeutic effect on patients with chronic liver disease.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance and molecular characterization of probiotic and clinical Lactobacillus strains in relation to safety aspects of probiotics.
AB  - The evaluation of the safety of probiotic strains includes the exclusion of antibiotic resistance of clinical importance. Ninety-two strains from the genus Lactobacillus isolated from probiotics, food, and clinical sources were included in the investigation. Species tested were the L. acidophilus group, L. casei group, L. reuteri/fermentum group, and L. sakei/curvatus group. Cell and colony morphology, fermentation patterns, and growth characteristics as well as soluble whole cell proteins were analyzed. Antibiotic resistance against clinically important agents was determined by broth dilution tests. The vanA and tet genes were confirmed. Resistances occurred mainly against gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, sulfonamides, and, in some cases, glycopeptides. The natural glycopeptide resistance within the L. casei group and L. reuteri appears to be not of clinical relevance, as there was no vanA gene present. Therefore, the transfer of this resistance is very unlikely. Tet-(A), -(B), -(C), -(M), or -(O) gene could not be detected. The protein fingerprinting within the L. casei group proved that L. rhamnosus strains of clinical origin clustered together with probiotic strains. For safety evaluations resistance patterns of a broad range of strains are a useful criterion together with the exclusion of known resistance genes (like the vanA gene) and can be used for decision making on the safety of probiotics, both by authorization bodies and manufacturers.
TI  - [Isolation and identification of probiotics from yoghourt in Beijing].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To carry out isolation and the viable plate count of probiotics from yoghourt. To investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility of strains to penicillin, gentamicin, ampicillin, vancomycin, clindamycin and erythromycin. METHODS: Probiotics were recovered and counted from yoghourt by plate count method. The recovered isolates were characterized by Gram's stain, biochemical test, antimicrobial susceptibility test. RESULTS: MRS medium and (36 +/- 1) degrees C were the optimum condition of culture. In total, 52 probiotic isolates were recovered from 31 yoghourt products, 12 (38.7%) products showed a lower probiotic quantity than 1 x 10(6) cfu/ml of the national stantard, and 19 (61.3%) products were higher than 1 x 10(6) cfu/ml. Gram's stain showed that 37 isolates were gram positive bacilli and 15 isolates were positive coccus. These 52 isolates were grouped into six species by biochemical method, including L. bulgaricus, S. thermophilus, L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. delbrueckii and L. fermentum. All 52 isolates were susceptible to penicillin and ampicillin, one isolate was resistant to both clindamycin and erythromycin, four isolates were resistant to vancomycin. CONCLUSION: Most of yoghourt products contained sufficient viable probiotics as required by the national standard. A small quantity of isolates were resistant to some antimicrobials and multi -drug resistant isolates were also found.
TI  - Effect of the antimicrobial decapeptide KSL on the growth of oral pathogens and Streptococcus mutans biofilm.
AB  - Dental caries and periodontitis are common oral bacterial infectious diseases. Their prevention and treatment requires control of the causative pathogens, such as Streptococcus mutans and Porphyromonas gingivalis, that exist within dental plaque. As one of the attractive future substitutes for conventional antibiotics, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), both natural and synthetic, have been widely tested and used for controlling bacterial infections. In this study, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of KSL (KKVVFKVKFK-NH(2)), a novel AMP, against several major cariogenic and periodontopathogenic bacteria as well as Candida albicans in vitro. Streptococcus mutans, the causative agent of dental caries, was chosen for in-depth testing. Bacterial susceptibility and time-kill assays were performed to investigate the sensitivity of S. mutans to KSL. The effect of KSL on biofilm formation and on pre-formed biofilm was also examined. For biofilm studies, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to observe and analyse bacterial biofilm. The results showed that KSL had antimicrobial activity against a variety of oral bacteria and fungi. Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus were the most susceptible strains to KSL peptide [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.0625 mg/mL] compared with other species tested (MICs of 0.125-1mg/mL). KSL also inhibited S. mutans biofilm formation, with a minimum biofilm inhibition concentration of 0.0625-0.125 mg/mL, and reduced 1-day-old developed S. mutans biofilm, with a minimum biofilm reduction concentration of 0.25-0.5mg/mL. CLSM images showed that KSL significantly reduced the viability of biofilm cells. This study suggests that KSL may have a potential clinical application in treating dental caries by killing S. mutans within dental plaque.
TI  - Probiotic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and Taiwanese pickled cabbage.
AB  - This study assessed potential probiotic Lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and from Taiwanese pickled cabbage for their possible use in probiotic fermented foods by evaluating their (i) in vitro adhesive ability, resistance to biotic stress, resistance to pathogenic bacteria, and production of beta-galactosidase; (ii) milk technological properties; and (iii) in vivo adhesive ability, intestinal survival and microbial changes during and after treatment. Five Lactobacillus isolates identified as Lactobacillus reuteri F03, Lactobacillus paracasei F08, Lactobacillus rhamnosus F14, Lactobacillus plantarum C06, and Lactobacillus acidophilus C11 that showed resistance to gastric juice and bile salts were selected for further evaluation of their probiotic properties. All the strains demonstrated the ability to adhere to Caco-2 cells, particularly, strain L. plantarum C06 and L. reuteri F03 showed satisfactory abilities, which were similar to that of the reference strain L. rhamnosus GG. The strains L. paracasei F08 and L. acidophilus C11 had the highest beta-galactosidase activity. Most of the strains were resistant to aminoglycosides and vancomycin but sensitive to ampicillin, erythromycin, and penicillin. All the 5 strains elicited antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus) and -negative (Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica) pathogens. Moreover, the strains L. reuteri F03, L. paracasei F08, and L. plantarum C06 could grow rapidly in milk without nutrient supplementation and reached 10(8) cfu/mL after 24 h of fermentation at 37 degrees C. The viable cell counts of the 3 strains remained above 10(7) cfu/mL after 21 d of storage at 4 degrees C. In the animal feeding trial, the number of intestinal lactobacilli increased significantly after administration of milk fermented with the 3 strains, and the counts of fecal coliforms and Clostridium perfringens were markedly reduced. Lactobacillus strains could also survive in the ileal intestinal tissue of the treated rats. Technologically interesting Lactobacillus isolates may be used in the future as probiotic starter cultures for manufacturing novel fermented foods.
TI  - Oral bacterial deactivation using a low-temperature atmospheric argon plasma brush.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the plasma treatment effects on deactivation effectiveness of oral bacteria. METHODS: A low temperature atmospheric argon plasma brush were used to study the oral bacterial deactivation effects in terms of plasma conditions, plasma exposure time, and bacterial supporting media. Oral bacteria of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus with an initial bacterial population density between 1.0x10(8) and 5.0x10(8)cfu/ml were seeded on various media and their survivability with plasma exposure was examined. Scanning electron microscopy was used to examine the morphological changes of the plasma treated bacteria. Optical absorption was used to determine the leakage of intracellular proteins and DNAs of the plasma treated bacteria. RESULTS: The experimental data indicated that the argon atmospheric plasma brush was very effective in deactivating oral bacteria. The plasma exposure time for a 99.9999% cell reduction was less than 15s for S. mutans and within 5 min for L. acidophilus. It was found that the plasma deactivation efficiency was also dependent on the bacterial supporting media. With plasma exposure, significant damages to bacterial cell structures were observed with both bacterium species. Leakage of intracellular proteins and DNAs after plasma exposure was observed through monitoring the absorbance peaks at wavelengths of 280 nm and 260 nm, respectively. CONCLUSION: The experimental results from this study indicated that low temperature atmospheric plasma treatment was very effective in deactivation of oral bacteria and could be a promising technique in various dental clinical applications such as bacterial disinfection and caries early prevention.
TI  - Bacteria competing with the adhesion and biofilm formation by Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The activity of antagonistic substances produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Lactobacillus acidophilus against the planktonic and sessile populations of Staphylococcus aureus strains was demonstrated. The strongest effects were caused by probiotic L. acidophilus strain - bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (BLIS) positive. However, the S. aureus A3 growth, adhesion and biofilm formation was also limited by cell-free supernatant of L. acidophilus H-1 (BLIS negative). Moreover, competitive direct interactions were observed between staphylococci and the above bacteria, which influenced the formation of dualspecies aggregates on the surface.
TI  - Rapid molecular identification and characteristics of Lactobacillus strains.
AB  - Eleven type strains and 24 Lactobacillus isolates, preliminarily classified to the species due to phenotypic features, were investigated. Standard methods of identification with species-specific PCRs and typing with PFGE (with ApaI, NotI and SmaI restriction enzymes) allowed us to distinguish 16 unique strains belonging to 5 species (L. acidophilus, L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus, L. salivarius). Alternative approach with 16S-23S rDNA ARDRA identification (with merely two restrictases, BsuRI and TaqI) and PCR-based typing (RAPD with two random- and rep-PCR with (GTG)(5) primers) showed to be more discriminative, i.e. 21 unique strains were classified in the same species as above. As a result, 7 out of 24 phenotypically species-assigned isolates were reclassified. The alternative procedure of rapid identification and typing of Lactobacillus isolates appeared to be equally effective and shortened from 1 week to 2-3 d (in comparison to the standard methods).
TI  - Anti-allergic effects of probiotic Dahi through modulation of the gut immune system.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The alarming increase in allergy in the last few decades demands the development of new anti-allergic prevention strategies, and consumption of functional foods (i.e. probiotic Dahi, which has already been proven to enhance immunity by modulation of the gut mucosal immune system) may be one of them. In the present study, we evaluated anti-allergic effects of a Dahi (yogurt) containing probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. casei and normal Dahi culture Lactococcus lactis biovar diacetylactis (named probiotic Dahi) on ovalbumin induced allergy in mice. METHODS: Allergy was induced by injecting (i.p.) ovalbumin at 0 and 14 days. Animals were fed with standard diet (control), milk, control Dahi or probiotic Dahi for 21 days. Total and ovalbumin-specific IgE, cytokines and lymphocyte proliferation index were examined after 7, 14 and 21 days. RESULTS: Feeding of probiotic Dahi completely suppressed the elevation of total and ovalbumin-specific IgE in the serum of ovalbumin-injected mice. Similarly, splenocytes collected from mice fed with probiotic Dahi entirely lost the total and ovalbumin-specific IgE production property during in-vitro culture. Production of T helper (Th)-1 cell-specific cytokines, i.e. interferon -gamma and interleukin (IL)-2, increased, while Th2-specific cytokines, i.e. IL-4 and IL-6, decreased in the supernatant of cultured splenocytes collected from mice fed with probiotic Dahi compared to the other groups. Moreover, ovalbumin-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation was strongly suppressed by feeding of probiotic Dahi in comparison to milk and control Dahi. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the present study indicate that probiotic Dahi suppressed ovalbumin-induced allergic consequences characterized by decreasing levels of total and ovalbumin-specific IgE and lymphocyte proliferation and skewed ovalbumin-induced Th2-specific immune response towards Th1-specific response.
TI  - Chitosan-based polyherbal toothpaste: as novel oral hygiene product.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present work was to develop chitosan-based polyherbal toothpaste and evaluate its plaque-reducing potential and efficacy in reduction of dental pathogens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antimicrobial activity of herbal extracts against dental pathogens were performed by using disk diffusion method. The pharmaceutical evaluation of toothpaste was carried out as per the US Government Tooth Paste Specifications. A 4-week clinical study was conducted in patients with oro-dental problems to evaluate the plaque removing efficacy of chitosan-based polyherbal toothpaste with commercially available chlorhexidine gluconate (0.2% w/v) mouthwash as positive control. Total microbial count was carried out to determine the percentage decrease in the oral bacterial count over the period of treatment. RESULT: Herbal extracts were found to possess satisfactory antimicrobial activity against most of the dental pathogens. Chitosan-containing polyherbal toothpaste significantly reduces the plaque index by 70.47% and bacterial count by 85.29%, and thus fulfills the majority of esthetic and medicinal requirements of oral hygiene products. CONCLUSION: Chitosan-based polyherbal toothpaste proves itself as a promising novel oral hygiene product as compared with currently available oral hygiene products. A further study to confirm the exact mechanism and active constituents behind antiplaque and antimicrobial activity of chitosan-based polyherbal toothpaste and its efficacy in large number of patient population is on high demand.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of members of the Lactobacillus acidophilus group using broth microdilution and molecular identification of their resistance determinants.
AB  - The range of antibiotic susceptibility to 13 antibiotics in 101 strains of the Lactobacillus acidophilus group was examined using the lactic acid bacteria susceptibility test medium (LSM) and broth microdilution. Additionally, microarray analysis and PCR were applied to identify resistance genes responsible for the displayed resistant phenotypes in a selection of strains. In general, narrow as well as broad unimodal and bimodal MIC distributions were observed for the Lactobacillus acidophilus group and the tested antimicrobial agents. Atypically resistant strains could be determined by visual inspection of the obtained MIC ranges for ampicillin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, erythromycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, streptomycin and tetracycline. For most of these atypically resistant strains underlying resistance determinants were found. To our knowledge erm(A) was detected in lactobacilli for the first time within this study. Data derived from this study can be used as a basis for reviewing present microbiological breakpoints for categorization of susceptible and resistant strains within the Lactobacillus acidophilus group to assess the safety of microorganisms intended for use in food and feed applications.
TI  - Lymphoid neoplastic P388D1 cells express membrane protein candidates that discriminate among the C-terminal phylogenetic diversity in heat shock protein 70 sequences.
AB  - We previously found that mouse inducible Hsp72 bound more extensively to lymphoblast-like lymphoid neoplastic P388D1 cells than to RAW264.7 monocyte-macrophages. In the present study, we analyzed the characteristics of the binding to P388D1 cells of recombinant HSP70 derived from different species. Recombinant mouse inducible-type Hsp72 bound extensively to P388D1 cells in a saturable manner, but not to P815 mastocytoma or EL4 thymoma. Spinach Hsc70-1, highly homologous with mouse Hsp72 in the C-terminal region, also bound to P388D1 cells. In contrast, significant binding was not observed for bacterial DnaK derived from Lactobacillus acidophilus and Escherichia coli which have relatively little homology in this region. Analyses of surface antigens showed that B220, and CD19, but not CD91, LOX-1, and CD40, the HSP70 receptors reported so far, were present on P388D1 cells, suggesting a B-cell lineage for this cell line. A similar discrimination of the diversity between mouse Hsp72 and bacterial DnaK occurred for CD19(+) B cells derived from mouse spleen, Peyer's patches, and mesenteric lymph nodes. The binding of HSP70 to P388D1 cells was partially, but significantly, antagonized by fucoidan and maleylated BSA, implying a few types of scavenger receptors to be responsible for the binding of HSP70 to this cell line. Furthermore, photo-affinity labeling revealed several membrane protein candidates larger than 110kDa to be involved in the recognition of HSP70 molecules. Using a NF-kappaB-luciferase reporter assay, we found that exogenous HSP70 did not stimulate NF-kappaB-dependent signal transduction in P388D1 cells. It thus follows that lymphoid neoplastic P388D1 cells express membrane protein candidates that discriminate among the C-terminal sequences of the HSP70 family. The present results indicate that several types of cells in the innate immune system may distinguish among the phylogenetically specific signals in protein molecules.
TI  - [Genetic improvement of technological characteristics of starters for fermented milk products].
AB  - Possibility for improvement of technological characteristics of lactobacilli using mutations of resistance to rifampicin (rif(r)) and streptomycin (str(r)) was studied. Using starter model of Narine Lactobacillus acidophilus INMIA-9602 Armenian diet milk product, it was showed that a possibility for selecting strains with increased rate of milk fermentation and acid production is higher in Rif(r) and Str(r) mutants induced by nitrosoguanidine than in cultures sensitive to antibiotics. The milk products obtained using Rif(r) and Str(r) strains had high viscosity, improved texture, increased amount of alive cells and good organoleptic features.
TI  - [Effect of birid triple viable on peptic ulcer patients with Helicobacter pylori  infection].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of birid triple viable on peptic ulcer patients  with Helicobacter pylori(H.pylori) infection. METHODS: A total of 120 peptic ulcer patients with H.pylori infection was randomly divided into 2 groups. The control group was treated with the triple therapy including Esomeprazole, Amoxicillin, and Furazolidone. The treatment group was treated with the same triple therapy plus birid triple viable. The pH values of the gastric juice, bacterial culture of the gastric juice, the therapy-related side effects and the healing rate of ulcer and erosive were observed before the treatment and after a 14-day-treatment respectively. The (14)C-urea breath test((14)C-UBT) was used to evaluate the H.pylori eradication rates 4 weeks after the treatment. RESULTS: After the treatment, pH values of the gastric juice in both groups were significantly higher than those before the treatment (P<0.05). When pH values of the gastric juice >/=4, the positive rate of bacterial culture in the treatment group was lower than that of the control group (80.0% and 97.4% respectively, P<0.05). The rate of adverse effects in the treatment group was lower than that in the control group (11.7% and 30% respectively, P<0.05).After a 2-week treatment, the healing rate of ulcer and erosion was 80% and 68.7% in the treatment group, and 73.3% and 40.7% in the control group. The healing rate of ulcer had no significant difference in the 2 groups (P>0.05),while the healing rate of erosion in the treatment group was higher than that of the control group (P<0.05).The H.pylori eradication rates evaluated by per-protocol (PP) analysis in the treatment group was significantly higher than that of the control group (80.4% and 62.4% respectively, P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The combined use of birid triple viable and the triple therapy of H.pylori in peptic ulcer patients with H.pylori infection can reduce the bacteria of the gastric juice and therapy-related side effects. It can increase the H.pylori eradication rate and promote the healing of erosion.
TI  - Polymerase chain reaction detection of Lactobacillus acidophilus in human oral cavity and fecal samples after 2-week consumption of yoghurt.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether short-term daily consumption of yoghurt leads to colonization by Lactobacillus acidophilus in a group of human subjects who were initially totally devoid of L. acidophilus in their oral cavities. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-three volunteers consumed yogurt containing L. acidophilus during a 14-day trial stage. Oral and fecal samples were collected at the clearance stage and at the post-yoghurt intake stage until L. acidophilus was found. Standard polymerase chain reaction methods using specific primers were adopted for the detection and identification of L. acidophilus. RESULTS: The isolation frequency decreased rapidly 72 h after stopping intake of yoghurt. After 1 week, L. acidophilus was absent in all oral samples. Non-significant differences were found between the survival rates of L. acidophilus in samples of saliva, plaque, tongue surface, and buccal mucosa. L. acidophilus was also found to remain in the gastrointestinal tract for longer than in the oral cavity. CONCLUSION: Allochthonous L. acidophilus is not likely to permanently colonize the oral cavity and intestine.
TI  - Effects of oral administration of Lactobacillus acidophilus L-92 on the symptoms  and serum markers of atopic dermatitis in children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have investigated the complementary effects of long-term  oral administration of Lactobacillus acidophilus on traditional medical therapy in the treatment of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). METHODS: The Atopic Dermatitis Area and Severity Index was used to evaluate AD severity. Symptom severity was assessed using the symptom score. The effect of medical therapy was evaluated by adding the medication score, calculated as the sum of each product of the amount of steroid ointment used for therapy and its designated strength graded on a 4-point scale, to the symptom score. The complementary effect of long-term oral administration of L. acidophilus strain L-92 (L-92) as a probiotic or biogenic strain in patients with AD was evaluated using the symptom-medication score, which was calculated as the sum of the symptom score and medication score. Both a preliminary casuistic study and a double-blinded, placebo-controlled study were performed to evaluate the effects of L-92 on the symptoms of AD in children. RESULTS: Orally administered L-92 significantly ameliorated the symptoms of AD in Japanese children. L-92 also affected the serum concentrations of thymus and activation-regulated chemokine in a time-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the preliminary trial and the double-blinded, placebo-controlled study revealed a complementary effect of oral L-92 on the standard medical therapy (topical application of a steroid ointment) in patients with AD that was mediated, at least in part, by alterations in the Th1/Th2 balance.
TI  - Sensory and microbiological quality of yogurt drinks with prebiotics and probiotics.
AB  - The popularity of dairy products fortified with prebiotics and probiotics continues to increase as consumers desire flavorful foods that will fulfill their health needs. Our objectives were to assess the sensory profile of drinkable yogurts made with prebiotics and probiotics and to determine the viability of the probiotics in the yogurt drink over the duration of storage. Thirteen trained descriptive panelists evaluated 10 yogurt drinks on a 16-point category scale. Three selected prebiotics, soluble corn fiber, polydextrose, and chicory inulin, were each present individually at an amount to claim an excellent source of fiber (5 g of fiber/serving) or a good source of fiber (2.5 g of fiber/serving) in 6 different yogurt drinks. Three additional yogurt drinks contained 5 g of each of the separate prebiotics along with a mixture of the selected probiotics (Bifidobacterium lactis Bb-12 and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5). A control sample with no prebiotics or probiotics was also included in the experimental design. Data were analyzed by ANOVA, Fisher's least significant difference, and principal component analysis. Survival of the probiotics in the yogurt drinks during a 30-d refrigerated storage period was also analyzed. Results showed that clover honey aroma, buttermilk aroma, butter aroma, sweetness, sourness, chalky mouthfeel, and viscosity were identified as significant attributes in the yogurt drinks. Total variance explained by the principal component analysis biplot of factors 1 and 2 was 65%, which showed yogurt drinks with soluble corn fiber and inulin varying by the sweet versus sour attributes and yogurt drinks with polydextrose varying by the mouthfeel attributes. The viability study determined a 2- to 3-log decrease in the survival of probiotics in all of the yogurt treatments during a 30-d refrigerated storage period. Based on the results of the current study, only the polydextrose treatment would be an acceptable vehicle to deliver the probiotic health effects at the end of the 30-d storage period.
TI  - Fermentation of calcium-fortified soya milk does not appear to enhance acute calcium absorption in osteopenic post-menopausal women.
AB  - Ageing women may choose to drink soya milk to reduce menopausal symptoms. As fermentation enriches soya milk with isoflavone aglycones, its beneficial qualities may improve. To reduce osteoporotic risk, however, soya milk must be Ca enriched, and it is not known how fermentation affects Ca bioavailability. A randomised crossover pilot study was undertaken to compare the Ca absorption of fortified soya milk with that of fermented and fortified soya milk in twelve Australian osteopenic post-menopausal women. The fortified soya milk was inoculated with Lactobacillus acidophilus American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 4962 and fermented for 24 h at 37 degrees C. Ca absorption from soya milk samples was measured using a single isotope radiocalcium method. Participants had a mean age of 54.8 (sd 12.3) years, with mean BMI of 26.5 (sd 5.5) kg/m2 and subnormal to normal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (mean 62.5 (sd 19.1) nmol/l). Participants consumed 185 kBq of 45Ca in 44 mg of Ca carrier. The mean fractional Ca absorption (alpha) from soya milk and fermented soya milk was 0.64 (sd 0.23) and 0.71 (sd 0.29), respectively, a difference not of statistical significance (P = 0.122). Although fermentation of soya milk may provide other health benefits, fermentation had little effect on acute Ca absorption.
TI  - Orally supplemented Lactobacillus acidophilus strain L-92 inhibits passive and active cutaneous anaphylaxis as well as 2,4-dinitroflurobenzene and mite fecal antigen induced atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions in mice.
AB  - Oral supplementation of lactic acid bacteria is a potential approach to the prevention and manipulation of allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis. Our previous report showed that heat-killed Lactobacillus acidophilus strain L-92 (L-92) possessed anti-allergic properties, although its physiological function in atopic dermatitis has largely remained undefined. To evaluate the anti-allergic efficacy of L-92, we used four experimental animal models with the major features of atopic dermatitis and compared the results to those of clinically active drugs. ICR mice were passively sensitized by anti-dinitrophenyl mouse monoclonal IgE for passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA), and BALB/c mice were actively sensitized by ovalbumin for active cutaneous anaphylaxis (ACA). Allergic reaction was induced by repeated exposure to 2,4-dinitroflurobenzene (DNFB) and mite (Dermatophagoides farinae) fecal allergen, in BALB/c and NC/Nga mice, respectively. Orally administrated L-92 significantly inhibited the vascular permeability increase in both PCA and ACA, and the elevation of ovalbumin-specific IgE titer in ACA. Moreover, repeated applications of DNFB and mite fecal antigen onto the BALB/c and NC/Nga mouse ear, respectively, caused clinical symptoms similar to atopic dermatitis such as ear swelling, scratching behavior and elevation of total serum IgE levels that were also moderately suppressed by L-92. In addition, L-92 treated mice exhibited lower levels of mast cells, eosinophil infiltration and Th1/Th2 cytokine expression. Our results, therefore, suggest that oral administration of L-92 might be useful for alleviating allergic symptoms.
TI  - Dying in yoghurt: the number of living bacteria in probiotic yoghurt decreases under exposure to room temperature.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: While probiotic bacteria are successfully used in the treatment  of ulcerative colitis, the effect of commercially available probiotic products is still controversial. Here, we study whether the number of living probiotic bacteria in yoghurts is altered by an interruption of the cold chain. METHODS: Three commonly available probiotic yoghurts were kept at 4 degrees C or put at room temperature (RT) for 6 h or 24 h. An aliquot of each yoghurt was applied on Man-Rogosa-Sharpe agar and incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 h. Colony forming units (CFU) were counted by microscopy. RESULTS: The first yoghurt, containing Lactobacillus johnsonii, showed a significant decrease in CFU after 6 h of storage at RT, which was further pronounced after 24 h. The number of CFU of the second yoghurt, containing Lactobacillus GG, was also decreased after 6 h and further diminished after 24 h at RT. From the third yoghurt, containing Lactobacillus acidophilus, only 53.8% of the CFU remained after 6 h at RT; after 24 h, only about one fourth of the CFU were found. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that the number of living probiotic bacteria in yoghurt products decreases dramatically after exposure to RT. This represents an important information for consumers of such products.
TI  - Functional and phenotypic characterization of a protein from Lactobacillus acidophilus involved in cell morphology, stress tolerance and adherence to intestinal cells.
AB  - Structural components of the cell surface have an impact on some of the beneficial attributes of probiotic bacteria. In silico analysis of the L. acidophilus NCFM genome sequence revealed the presence of a putative cell surface protein that was predicted to be a myosin cross-reactive antigen (MCRA). As MCRAs are conserved among many probiotic bacteria, we used the upp-based counterselective gene replacement system, designed recently for use in L. acidophilus, to determine the functional role of this gene (LBA649) in L. acidophilus NCFM. Phenotypic assays were undertaken with the parent strain (NCK1909) and deletion mutant (NCK2015) to assign a function for this gene. The growth of NCK2015 (DeltaLBA649) was reduced in the presence of lactate, acetate, porcine bile and salt. Adhesion of NCK2015 to Caco-2 cells was substantially reduced for both stationary-phase ( approximately 45 % reduction) and exponential-phase cells ( approximately 50 % reduction). Analysis of NCK2015 by scanning electron microscopy revealed a longer cell morphology after growth in MRS broth compared to NCK1909. These results indicate a role for LBA649 in stress tolerance, cell wall division and adherence to Caco-2 cells.
TI  - Intestinal lactobacilli and the DC-SIGN gene for their recognition by dendritic cells play a role in the aetiology of allergic manifestations.
AB  - Diminished exposure to harmless micro-organisms, such as lactobacilli, has been suggested to play a role in the increased prevalence of allergic disorders in Westernized communities. The development of allergies depends on both environmental factors and genetic variations, including polymorphisms in genes encoding pattern recognition receptors. The present study examines the effects of both colonization with specific Lactobacillus species and genetic variations in DC-SIGN, a pattern recognition receptor on dendritic cells that recognizes lactobacilli, on the development of atopic dermatitis (AD) and sensitization in infancy. Within the KOALA Birth Cohort Study, faecal samples of 681 one-month-old infants were collected and quantitatively screened for five Lactobacillus species: L. casei, L. paracasei, L. rhamnosus, L. acidophilus and L. reuteri. Eleven haplotype-tagging polymorphisms in the DC-SIGN gene were genotyped in these children. Allergic outcomes were a clinical diagnosis of AD and sensitization (specific IgE) at age 2 years. L. rhamnosus (31.5 %), L. paracasei (31.3 %) and L. acidophilus (14.4 %) were frequently detected in the faecal samples of one-month-old infants, whereas L. casei (2.5 %) and L. reuteri (<1 %) were rare. Colonization with L. paracasei decreased the risk of AD significantly (odds ratio 0.57, 95 % confidence interval 0.32-0.99), whereas effects of L. acidophilus were of borderline statistical significance (0.46, 0.20-1.04). Two DC-SIGN polymorphisms, rs11465413 and rs8112555, were statistically significantly associated with atopic sensitization. The present study supports the 'old friends' hypothesis suggesting that certain health-beneficial micro-organisms protect us from developing allergies and that these protective effects are species-dependent. Firm conclusions on the potential interaction between lactobacillus colonization and genetic variations in DC-SIGN in association with the development of allergic disorders cannot be drawn, given the limited power of our study. Therefore, incorporation of consecutive faecal sampling in newly started (birth) cohort studies would be a first requisite to further increase our understanding of host-microbial interactions in health and disease.
TI  - Human mucosal in vivo transcriptome responses to three lactobacilli indicate how  probiotics may modulate human cellular pathways.
AB  - Probiotic bacteria, specific representatives of bacterial species that are a common part of the human microbiota, are proposed to deliver health benefits to the consumer by modulation of intestinal function through largely unknown molecular mechanisms. To explore in vivo mucosal responses of healthy adults to probiotics, we obtained transcriptomes in an intervention study after a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over design. In the mucosa of the proximal small intestine of healthy volunteers, probiotic strains from the species Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. casei, and L. rhamnosus each induced differential gene-regulatory networks and pathways in the human mucosa. Comprehensive analyses revealed that these transcriptional networks regulate major basal mucosal processes and uncovered remarkable similarity to response profiles obtained for specific bioactive molecules and drugs. This study elucidates how intestinal mucosa of healthy humans perceives different probiotics and provides avenues for rationally designed tests of clinical applications.
TI  - Heterologous expression of glycoside hydrolase family 2 and 42 beta-galactosidases of lactic acid bacteria in Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - This study characterized a glycoside hydrolase family 42 (GH42) beta-galactosidase of Lactobacillus acidophilus (LacA) and compared lactose hydrolysis, hydrolysis of oNPG, pNPG and pNPG-analogues and galactooligosaccharides (GOSs) formation to GH2 beta-galactosidases of Streptococcus thermophilus (LacZ type), Lactobacillus plantarum and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris (both LacLM type). Beta-galactosidases were heterologously expressed in Lactococcus lactis using a p170 derived promoter; experiments were performed with L. lactis crude cell extract (CCE). The novel GH42 beta-galactosidase of Lb. acidophilus had lower activity on lactose, oNPG and pNPG but higher relative activity on pNP analogues compared to GH2 beta-galactosidases, and did not transgalactosylate at high lactose concentrations. Temperature and pH optima for lactose hydrolysis varied between GH2 beta-galactosidases. oNPG and pNPG were the preferred substrates for hydrolysis; in comparison, activity on pNPG-analogues was less than 1.5%. GH2 beta-galactosidases formed structurally similar GOS with varying preferences. The diversity of lactic acid bacteria beta-galactosidase activity in L. lactis CCE can be exploited in future nutritional or therapeutic applications.
TI  - Effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM on insulin sensitivity and the systemic inflammatory response in human subjects.
AB  - According to animal studies, intake of probiotic bacteria may improve glucose homeostasis. We hypothesised that probiotic bacteria improve insulin sensitivity by attenuating systemic inflammation. Therefore, the effects of oral supplementation with the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM on insulin sensitivity and the inflammatory response were investigated in subjects with normal or impaired insulin sensitivity. In a double-blinded, randomised fashion, forty-five males with type 2 diabetes, impaired or normal glucose tolerance were enrolled and allocated to a 4-week treatment course with either L. acidophilus NCFM or placebo. L. acidophilus was detected in stool samples by denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis and real-time PCR. Separated by the 4-week intervention period, two hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamps were performed to estimate insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, the systemic inflammatory response was evaluated by subjecting the participants to Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide injection (0.3 ng/kg) before and after the treatment course. L. acidophilus NCFM was detected in 75 % of the faecal samples after treatment with the probiotic bacterium. Insulin sensitivity was preserved among volunteers in the L. acidophilus NCFM group, whereas it decreased in the placebo group. Both baseline inflammatory markers and the systemic inflammatory response were, however, unaffected by the intervention. In conclusion, intake of L. acidophilus NCFM for 4 weeks preserved insulin sensitivity compared with placebo, but did not affect the systemic inflammatory response.
TI  - New method for electroporation of Lactobacillus species grown in high salt.
AB  - We here describe a new method for electroporation of Lactobacillus species, obligately homofermentative and facultatively heterofermentative, based on the cell-wall weakening resulting from growth in high-salt media. For L. casei, optimum transformation efficiency of up to 10(5) transformants per microgram of plasmid DNA was achieved following growth in the presence of 0.9 M NaCl. Plasmids of different sizes and replication origins were also similarly transformed. These competent cells could be used either directly or stored frozen, up to 1 month, for future use, with similar efficiency. This protocol was assayed with different Lactobacillus species: L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, L. paracasei, L. plantarum and L. acidophilus, and it was found that they were transformed with similar efficiency.
TI  - Patterns of survival and volatile metabolites of selected Lactobacillus strains during long-term incubation in milk.
AB  - The focus of this study was to monitor the survival of populations and the volatile compound profiles of selected Lactobacillus strains during long-term incubation in milk. The enumeration of cells was determined by both the Direct Epifluorescent Filter Technique using carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFDA) staining and the plate method. Volatile compounds were analysed by the gas-chromatography technique. All strains exhibited good survival in cultured milks, but Lactobacillus crispatus L800 was the only strain with comparable growth and viability in milk, assessed by plate and epifluorescence methods. The significant differences in cell numbers between plate and microscopic counts were obtained for L. acidophilus strains. The investigated strains exhibited different metabolic profiles. Depending on the strain used, 3 to 8 compounds were produced. The strains produced significantly higher concentrations of acetic acid, compared to other volatiles. Lactobacillus strains differed from one another in number and contents of the volatile compounds.
TI  - Probiotics in the treatment of acute rotavirus diarrhoea. A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial using two different probiotic preparations in Bolivian children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that probiotics reduce rotavirus diarrhoea duration. Although there are several probiotic strains potentially useful, daily practice is often limited by the type and number of products locally available. In general, information about combined products is scarce. In this study we compare the effect of two probiotic products in the treatment of diarrhoea in children less than 2 years of age. METHODS: A Randomized double-blind controlled clinical trial in children hospitalized for acute rotavirus diarrhoea, in the Paediatric Centre Albina Patino, Cochabamba, Bolivia.Participants were children aged 1 - 23 months, who were randomly assigned to receive one of three treatments: Oral rehydration therapy plus placebo; Oral rehydration solution plus Saccharomyces boulardii; or Oral rehydration solution plus a compound containing Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium longum and Saccharomyces boulardii. Sample size was 20 per group and the outcomes were duration of diarrhoea, of fever, of vomiting and of hospitalization. RESULTS: 64 cases finished the protocol. On admission, patients' characteristics were similar. Median duration of diarrhoea (p = 0.04) in children who received the single species product (58 hours) was shorter than in controls (84.5 hrs). Comparing children that received the single probiotic product and controls showed shorter duration of fever (18 vs 67 hrs) (p = 0.0042) and the mixed probiotic of vomiting (0 vs 42.5 hrs) (p = 0.041). There was no effect on duration of hospitalization (p = 0.31). When experimental groups were merged, statistical significance of changes increased (total duration of diarrhoea, fever and vomiting P = 0.025, P = 0.025 and P = 0.014, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Both products decreased the duration of diarrhoea compared to oral rehydration solution alone. This decrease was significant only for the single species product which also decreased the duration of fever. With the multiple species product there was no vomiting subsequent to the initiation of treatment. The quantity of probiotic bacteria needed for optimum treatment of gastroenteritis remains to be determined, particularly when multiple species are included in the product.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT00981877Link: https://register.clinicaltrials.gov/prs/app/action/SelectProtocol/sid/S0002653/se lectaction/View/ts/2/uid/U0000N04 TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical trials NCT ID: NCT00981877.
TI  - Clinical trial: the microbiological and immunological effects of synbiotic consumption - a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study in active Crohn's disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is an inflammatory illness in which the immune response against gut microorganisms is believed to drive an abnormal immune response. Consequently, modification of mucosal bacterial communities, and the immune effects they elicit, might be used to modify the disease state. AIM: To investigate the effects of synbiotic consumption on disease processes in patients with Crohn's disease. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial was conducted involving 35 patients with active Crohn's disease, using a synbiotic comprising Bifidobacterium longum and Synergy 1. Clinical status was scored and rectal biopsies were collected at the start, and at 3- and 6-month intervals. Transcription levels of immune markers and mucosal bacterial 16S rRNA gene copy numbers were quantified using real-time PCR. RESULTS: Significant improvements in clinical outcomes occurred with synbiotic consumption, with reductions in both Crohn's disease activity indices (P = 0.020) and histological scores (P = 0.018). The synbiotic had little effect on mucosal IL-18, INF-gamma and IL-1beta; however, significant reductions occurred in TNF-alpha expression in synbiotic patients at 3 months (P = 0.041), although not at 6 months. Mucosal bifidobacteria proliferated in synbiotic patients. CONCLUSION: Synbiotic consumption was effective in improving clinical symptoms in patients with active Crohn's disease.
TI  - [Identification of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus thermophilus by PCR amplification and sequence analysis of 16S rRNA].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a PCR method for identifying the 16S rRNA of Lactobacillus  and Streptococcus thermophilus at the species level. METHODS: Optimizing the method for DNA extraction and the conditions for PCR amplification. Joining the PCR amplification products from 16S rRNA to plasmid puc18-T and detecting the sequence. RESULTS: All 50 isolates recovered from yoghourt products were characterized by 16S rRNA sequence analysis and 7 groups were identified as L. bulgaricus (24 strains), S. thermophilus (12 strains), L. acidophilus (7 strains), L. casei (3 strains), L. delbrueckii (2 strains), L. fermentum (1 strain) and S. lutetiensis (1 strain). CONCLUSION: 16S rRNA PCR method developed in this research is a sensitive and reliable method for the identification of both Lactobacillus and Streptococcus thermophilus.
TI  - The effect of selected microbial strains on internal milieu of broiler chickens after peroral administration.
AB  - The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of probiotic preparation with  multi-strains composition (Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus LAT 187, Lactobacillus acidophilus LAT 180, Lactobacillus helveticus LAT 179, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis LAT 182, Streptococcus thermophilus LAT 205 and Enterococcus faecium E 253) on internal milieu, antioxidant status and body weight of broiler chickens. Chickens were divided into three groups (C, control; E1 and E2, experimental groups). Experimental chickens received the probiotic preparation in drinking water. Probiotic preparation caused a significant increase of serum calcium and potassium content. In the group with higher dose of probiotic strains serum triglycerides level decreased. Total antioxidant status in groups with addition of probiotic strains showed higher values in comparison to control group. Serum albumin level was found to increase after consumption of probiotic preparation in group with higher dose of probiotic strains. Probiotic strains improved body weight in last observed weeks of feeding.
TI  - Phytase activity from Lactobacillus spp. in calcium-fortified soymilk.
AB  - The presence of phytate in calcium-fortified soymilk may interfere with mineral absorption. Certain lactic acid bacteria (LAB) produce the enzyme phytase that degrades phytates and therefore may potentially improve mineral bioavailability and absorption. This study investigates the phytase activity and phytate degradation potential of 7 strains of LAB including: Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC4962, ATCC33200, ATCC4356, ATCC4161, L. casei ASCC290, L. plantarum ASCC276, and L. fermentum VRI-003. Activity of these bacteria was examined both in screening media and in calcium-fortified soymilk supplemented with potassium phytate. Most strains produced phytase under both conditions with L. acidophilus ATCC4161 showing the highest activity. Phytase activity in fortified soymilk fermented with L. acidophilus ATCC4962 and L. acidophilus ATCC4161 increased by 85% and 91%, respectively, between 12 h and 24 h of fermentation. All strains expressed peak phytase activity at approximately pH 5. However, no phytate degradation could be observed.
TI  - Targeted expression of anthrax protective antigen by Lactobacillus gasseri as an  anthrax vaccine.
AB  - AIM: Induction of protective immunity against pathogenic microbes, including Bacillus anthracis, requires efficient vaccines that potentiate antibody avidity and increase T-cell longevity. We recently reported that the delivery of targeted B. anthracis protective antigen (PA) genetically fused to a DC-binding peptide (DCpep) by Lactobacillus acidophilus induced mucosal and systemic immunity against B. anthracis challenge in mice. MATERIALS & METHODS: Improvement of this oral vaccine strategy was attempted by use of the high copy and genetically stable q-replicating vector, pTRKH2, for expression of the targeted PA fusion protein in Lactobacillus gasseri, a common human commensal microbe, to vaccinate animals against anthrax Sterne infection. RESULTS: Oral application of L. gasseri expressing the PA-DCpep fusion proteins elicited robust PA-neutralizing antibody and T-cell mediated immune responses against anthrax Sterne challenge, resulting in complete animal survival. Collectively, this improved expression vaccine strategy reduced the number of inoculations and length of the boosting period, leading to animal protection via efficacious bacterial adjuvanticity and safe oral delivery of this vaccine to mucosal immune cells, including dendritic cells. CONCLUSION: Lactobacillus-based delivery offers tremendous practical advantages. Recombinant antigens such as PA would not require chemical coupling agents, and the recombinant bacteria can be administered orally where upon both mucosal and systemic immune responses are elicited.
TI  - Suppression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication in macrophages by  commensal bacteria preferentially stimulating Toll-like receptor 4.
AB  - Protection from primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection has not yet been accomplished by vaccines inducing HIV-1-specific acquired immunity. Nevertheless, it has been reported that a small subgroup of women remain resistant to HIV-1 infection under natural conditions. If similar conditions can be induced in uninfected individuals, it will contribute the first line of protection against HIV-1 infection, and also improve the effects of anti-HIV-1 vaccines. We reasoned that innate immunity may be involved in the resistance to HIV-1 infection, and investigated the effects of various Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands and commensal bacteria on HIV-1 replication in macrophages, one of the initial targets of HIV-1 infection and also the main mediators of innate immunity. We established the HIV-1 reporter monocytic cell line, THP-1/NL4-3luc, which could be differentiated into macrophage-like cells in vitro. In these cells, stimulation of TLR3 and TLR4 by their ligands suppressed HIV-1 expression partly through type I interferon (IFN). Among the commensal bacteria tested, Escherichia coli, Veillonella parvula and Neisseria mucosa suppressed HIV-1 expression, whereas Lactobacillus acidophilus, Prevotella melaninogenica, P. bivia and Mycobacterium smegmatis enhanced it. The bacteria with suppressive effects preferentially stimulated TLR4, whereas the ones with enhancing effects stimulated TLR2. Neutralizing antibodies against TLR4 and IFN-alpha/beta receptor abrogated bacterially mediated HIV-1 suppression. Suppressive effects of E. coli, V. parvula and N. mucosa on HIV-1 replication were reproducible in primary monocyte-derived macrophages following acute HIV-1 infection. These findings suggest that certain commensal bacteria preferentially stimulating TLR4 potentially produce local environments resistant to HIV-1 infection.
TI  - Rational engineering of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM maltose phosphorylase into either trehalose or kojibiose dual specificity phosphorylase.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM maltose phosphorylase (LaMP) of the (alpha/alpha)(6)-barrel glycoside hydrolase family 65 (GH65) catalyses both phosphorolysis of maltose and formation of maltose by reverse phosphorolysis with beta-glucose 1-phosphate and glucose as donor and acceptor, respectively. LaMP has about 35 and 26% amino acid sequence identity with GH65 trehalose phosphorylase (TP) and kojibiose phosphorylase (KP) from Thermoanaerobacter brockii ATCC35047. The structure of L. brevis MP and multiple sequence alignment identified (alpha/alpha)(6)-barrel loop 3 that forms the rim of the active site pocket as a target for specificity engineering since it contains distinct sequences for different GH65 disaccharide phosphorylases. Substitution of LaMP His413-Glu421, His413-Ile418 and His413-Glu415 from loop 3, that include His413 and Glu415 presumably recognising the alpha-anomeric O-1 group of the glucose moiety at subsite +1, by corresponding segments from Ser426-Ala431 in TP and Thr419-Phe427 in KP, thus conferred LaMP with phosphorolytic activity towards trehalose and kojibiose, respectively. Two different loop 3 LaMP variants catalysed the formation of trehalose and kojibiose in yields superior of maltose by reverse phosphorolysis with (alpha1, alpha1)- and alpha-(1,2)-regioselectivity, respectively, as analysed by nuclear magnetic resonance. The loop 3 in GH65 disaccharide phosphorylase is thus a key determinant for specificity both in phosphorolysis and in regiospecific reverse phosphorolysis.
TI  - Biodegradable gelatin-chitosan films incorporated with essential oils as antimicrobial agents for fish preservation.
AB  - Essential oils of clove (Syzygium aromaticum L.), fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Miller), cypress (Cupressus sempervirens L.), lavender (Lavandula angustifolia), thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.), herb-of-the-cross (Verbena officinalis L.), pine (Pinus sylvestris) and rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) were tested for their antimicrobial activity on 18 genera of bacteria, which included some important food pathogen and spoilage bacteria. Clove essential oil showed the highest inhibitory effect, followed by rosemary and lavender. In an attempt to evaluate the usefulness of these essential oils as food preservatives, they were also tested on an extract made of fish, where clove and thyme essential oils were the most effective. Then, gelatin-chitosan-based edible films incorporated with clove essential oil were elaborated and their antimicrobial activity tested against six selected microorganisms: Pseudomonas fluorescens, Shewanella putrefaciens, Photobacterium phosphoreum, Listeria innocua, Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus acidophilus. The clove-containing films inhibited all these microorganisms irrespectively of the film matrix or type of microorganism. In a further experiment, when the complex gelatin-chitosan film incorporating clove essential oil was applied to fish during chilled storage, the growth of microorganisms was drastically reduced in gram-negative bacteria, especially enterobacteria, while lactic acid bacteria remained practically constant for much of the storage period. The effect on the microorganisms during this period was in accordance with biochemical indexes of quality, indicating the viability of these films for fish preservation.
TI  - Nisin inhibits dental caries-associated microorganism in vitro.
AB  - Nisin, produced by Lactococcus lactis, is an antibiotic peptide to effectively antagonize a broad spectrum of Gram-positive bacteria, and is widely used as a safe food antimicrobial agent. In the present study, we investigated whether nisin could be used as an effective antibiotic peptide against the nine common cariogenic microorganisms, and its antimicrobial activity could be affected by the ingredients of saliva in oral cavity. In the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericide concentration (MBC) and spot-on-lawn assay, nisin displayed different MIC, MBC and antimicrobial activity against the nine tested strains. There was statistical difference between the inhibitory zone diameters of nisin against the different tested bacteria (p<0.05), but no statistical difference between the inhibitory zone diameters of nisin dissolved in PBS and saliva (p>0.05). Furthermore, morphology and membranes of Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus fermenti and Lactobacillus acidophilus with nisin treatment were observed and showed different degrees of variation by a Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM). Our findings suggested that nisin has considerable potential for prevention and treatment of dental caries.
TI  - The effect of pre- and probiotics on the colonic ammonia metabolism in humans as  measured by lactose-[(1)(5)N(2)]ureide.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The evaluation of ammonia detoxification by pre- and probiotics by means of colonic lactose-[(15)N(2)]ureide ((15)N-LU) degradation is of great interest both scientifically and in terms of nutrition physiology. OBJECTIVE: Pre- and probiotics were supplemented in healthy adults to evaluate the effect of the ammonia metabolism in the human colon by means of (15)N-LU. METHODS: A total of 14 participants aged 20-28 years daily received a regular diet either without (no treatment) or with supplementation of 30 g fibre of potatoes (FPs), 30 g wrinkle pea starch (WPS, resistant starch content: 12 and 70%, respectively) and 375 g Lactobacillus acidophilus (LC1) yoghurt, over a 10-day period in a randomised order. After 1 week, 5.7 mg/kg body weight (15)N-LU was administered together with breakfast. A venous blood sample was taken after 6 h. Urine and faeces were collected over a period of 48 and 72 h, respectively. The (15)N abundances were measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The mean renal (15)N-excretion differed significantly between the supplementation of FP and no treatment (32.5 versus 46.3%, P=0.034), FP and LC1 (32.5 versus 51.6%, P=0.001), and WPS and LC1 (38.5 versus 51.6%, P=0.048). The mean faecal (15)N-excretion amounted to 42.7% (no treatment), 59.7% (FP), 41.8% (WPS) and 44.0% (LC1). In comparison with no treatment, the urinary (15)NH(3)-enrichment was significantly decreased at 16 h after FP supplementation. CONCLUSION: The prebiotic intake of FP and WPS lowered the colonic generation and the renal excretion of toxic (15)NH(3), respectively, when using (15)N-LU as a xenobiotic marker.
TI  - Lactic acid fermentation of germinated barley fiber and proliferative function of colonic epithelial cells in loperamide-induced rats.
AB  - To develop a functional food from the dietary fiber fraction of germinated barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) (GBF), lactic acid fermentation was attempted using Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Bifidobacterium bifidus. The quality characteristics of the lactic acid-fermented product and its effect on gastrointestinal function in an animal model were examined. The anaerobic fermentation of 1% and 2% GBF yielded lactic acid bacteria at 8.9 +/- 1.0 x 10(8) and 1.6 +/- 0.2 x 10(9) colony-forming units/mL, and it was considered acceptable for consumption by sensory assessment. To determine the effect on gastrointestinal function, Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with three types of diets: a normal chow diet and chow diets supplemented with 10% lactic acid bacteria or a yogurt fermented with 2% GBF (GBFY). The rats fed GBFY for 6 weeks gained less body weight, excreted more fecal mass, and had improved gastrointestinal transit as examined with barium sulfate. The effect of GBFY on colonic epithelial proliferation was investigated through loperamide (LPM)-induced constipation in rats. The rats fed with GBFY for 6 weeks were intraperitoneally administered LPM twice daily for 7 days. GBFY supplementation decreased fecal excretion and moisture content in feces and depleted goblet cells as observed by hematoxylin and eosin stain. However, the rats supplemented with GBFY prior to the LPM administration had enhanced bowel movement, mucin secretion, and production of short-chain fatty acids compared with values for the LPM-alone group. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the GBFY supplement increased the numbers of nuclei stained positively for Ki-67 and extended from the base to the middle zone of crypts. These results indicate that GBFY alleviates constipation via the proliferation of the colonic crypts in LPM-administered rats.
TI  - Effects of lactobacilli on cytokine expression by chicken spleen and cecal tonsil cells.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus reuteri, and Lactobacillus salivarius are all normal residents of the chicken gastrointestinal tract. Given the interest in using probiotic bacteria in chicken production and the important role of the microbiota in the development and regulation of the host immune system, the objective of the current study was to examine the differential effects of these bacteria on cytokine gene expression profiles of lymphoid tissue cells. Mononuclear cells isolated from cecal tonsils and spleens of chickens were cocultured with one of the three live bacteria, and gene expression was analyzed via real-time quantitative PCR. All three lactobacilli induced significantly more interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) expression in spleen cells than in cecal tonsil cells, indicating a more inflammatory response in the spleen than in cecal tonsils. In cecal tonsil cells, substantial differences were found among strains in the capacity to induce IL-12p40, IL-10, IL-18, transforming growth factor beta4 (TGF-beta4), and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma). In conclusion, we demonstrated that L. acidophilus is more effective at inducing T-helper-1 cytokines while L. salivarius induces a more anti-inflammatory response.
TI  - Efficacy of vaginal probiotic capsules for recurrent bacterial vaginosis: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We assessed the effectiveness of vaginal probiotic capsules for recurrent bacterial vaginosis (BV) prevention. STUDY DESIGN: One hundred twenty healthy Chinese women with a history of recurrent BV were assigned randomly to daily vaginal prophylaxis with 1 capsule (Probaclac Vaginal; Nicar Laboratories, Inc, Blainville, Quebec, Canada) that contained 8 billion colony-forming units of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, L acidophilus, and Streptococcus thermophilus (n = 58 women) or 1 placebo capsule (n = 62 women) for 7 days on, 7 days off, and 7 days on. RESULTS: Probiotic prophylaxis resulted in lower recurrence rates for BV (15.8% [9/57 women] vs 45.0% [27/60 women]; P < .001) and Gardnerella vaginalis incidence through 2 months (3.5% [2/57 women] vs 18.3% [11/60 women]; P = .02). Between the 2- and 11-month follow-up period, women who received probiotics reported a lower incidence of BV and G vaginalis. Aside from vaginal discharge and malodor, no adverse events were reported in either study group. CONCLUSION: Short-term probiotic prophylaxis is well tolerated and reduces BV recurrence and G vaginalis risk through 11 months after treatment.
TI  - Biochemical patterns in ovine cheese: influence of probiotic strains.
AB  - This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of lamb rennet paste containing  probiotic strains on proteolysis, lipolysis, and glycolysis of ovine cheese manufactured with starter cultures. Cheeses included control cheese made with rennet paste, cheese made with rennet paste containing Lactobacillus acidophilus culture (LA-5), and cheese made with rennet paste containing a mix of Bifidobacterium lactis (BB-12) and Bifidobacterium longum (BB-46). Cheeses were sampled at 1, 7, 15, and 30 d of ripening. Starter cultures coupled with probiotics strains contained in rennet paste affected the acidification and coagulation phases leading to the lowest pH in curd and cheese containing probiotics during ripening. As consequence, maturing cheese profiles were different among cheese treatments. Cheeses produced using rennet paste containing probiotics displayed higher percentages of alpha(S1)-I-casein fraction than traditional cheese up to 15 d of ripening. This result could be an outcome of the greater hydrolysis of alpha-casein fraction, attributed to higher activity of the residual chymosin. Further evidence for this trend is available in chromatograms of water-soluble nitrogen fractions, which indicated a more complex profile in cheeses made using lamb paste containing probiotics versus traditional cheese. Differences can be observed for the peaks eluted in the highly hydrophobic zone being higher in cheeses containing probiotics. The proteolytic activity of probiotic bacteria led to increased accumulation of free amino acids. Their concentrations in cheese made with rennet paste containing Lb. acidophilus culture and cheese made with rennet paste containing a mix of B. lactis and B. longum were approximately 2.5 and 3.0 times higher, respectively, than in traditional cheese. Principal component analysis showed a more intense lipolysis in terms of both free fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acid content in probiotic cheeses; in particular, the lipolytic pattern of cheeses containing Lb. acidophilus is distinguished from the other cheeses on the basis of highest content of health-promoting molecules. The metabolic activity of the cheese microflora was also monitored by measuring acetic, lactic, and citric acids during cheese ripening. Cheese acceptability was expressed for color, smell, taste, and texture perceived during cheese consumption. Use of probiotics in trial cheeses did not adversely affect preference or acceptability; in fact, panelists scored probiotic cheeses higher in preference over traditional cheese, albeit not significantly.
TI  - Probiotics for prevention of necrotising enterocolitis: an updated meta-analysis.
AB  - Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have investigated the prophylactic use of probiotics in preterm infants aimed at reducing the rate of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC). There are 4 meta-analyses on this subject. 2 more RCTs have been published since these meta-analyses were completed. Each meta-analysis, as well as the 2 recent RCTs, document reduced rates of NEC and mortality with the use of prophylactic probiotics. We calculated meta-analyses based on 3 approaches: A - RCTs common to all meta-analyses, B - RCTs ever accounted for in a meta-analysis but not common to all, and C - the 2 recent RCTs. The 3 subgroups yield similar results, with an overall reduction in the relative risk (RR) of NEC (Bell > or =2) to 0.35 (95% CI 0.23-0.55) and of mortality to 0.41 (0.28-0.60). NEC rates and mortalities in the dominant RCTs are in the range reported from North American and European networks. Best results appear to be achieved with probiotics based on 2 or more probiotic species and/or with a combination of Bifidusbacterium spp. and Lactobacillus acidophilus. No unwanted side effects have been reported among 1 117 infants randomized to receive probiotics. We conclude that probiotics are safe and beneficial in preterm infants at risk for NEC.
TI  - Probiotic supplement reduces atopic dermatitis in preschool children: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of probiotics in the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD) remains controversial. A recent systematic review of the available evidence called for further clinical trials with new probiotic formulations. OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical efficacy and impact of Lactobacillus acidophilus DDS-1, Bifidobacterium lactis UABLA-12 with fructo-oligosaccharide on peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets in preschool children with moderate-to-severe AD. METHOD: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective trial of 90 children aged 1-3 years with moderate-to-severe AD who were treated with a mixture of L. acidophilus DDS-1, B. lactis UABLA-12 with fructo-oligosaccharide at a dosage of 5 billion colony-forming units twice daily for 8 weeks versus placebo. The primary outcome measure was the percentage change in Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) value. Other outcome measures were changes in Infant Dermatitis Quality Of Life (IDQOL) and Dermatitis Family Impact (DFI) scores, frequency and amount of topical corticosteroid used, and lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood measured by laser flow cytometry. RESULTS: At the final visit, the percentage decrease in SCORAD was 33.7% in the probiotic group compared with 19.4% in the placebo group (p = 0.001). Children receiving probiotic showed a greater decrease in the mean [SD] SCORAD score than did children from the placebo group at week 8 (-14.2 [9.9] vs -7.8 [7.7], respectively; p = 0.001). IDQOL and DFI scores decreased significantly from baseline by 33.0% and 35.2% in the probiotic group and by 19.0% and 23.8% in the placebo group, respectively (p = 0.013, p = 0.010). Use of topical corticosteroids during the 8-week trial period averaged 7.7 g less in probiotic patients (p = 0.006). CD3, CD16, and CD22 lymphocyte subsets remained unchanged, whereas the percentage of CD4, and the percentage and absolute count of CD25 decreased, and the percentage and absolute count of CD8 increased in the probiotic group at week 8 (p < 0.007 vs placebo). There was a significant correlation between CD4 percentage, CD25 percentage, CD25 absolute count, and SCORAD values (r = 0.642, r = 0.746, r = 0.733, respectively; p < 0.05) in the probiotic group at week 8. CONCLUSION: The administration of a probiotic mixture containing L. acidophilus DDS-1, B. lactis UABLA-12, and fructo-oligosaccharide was associated with significant clinical improvement in children with AD, with corresponding lymphocyte subset changes in peripheral blood. The efficacy of probiotic therapy in adults with AD requires further investigation.
TI  - Physico-chemical properties, probiotic survivability, microstructure, and acceptability of a yogurt-like symbiotic oats-based product using pre-polymerized whey protein as a gelation agent.
AB  - Consumption of a food product containing prebiotics and probiotics has been recognized as an important factor in lowering risk of intestinal cancer and gastrointestinal diseases and risks associated with high cholesterol. An oats-based symbiotic yogurt-like food (Oagurt) was developed using oats and probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Bifidobacterium), with pre-polymerized whey protein (PWP) as a gelation agent. The product was also fortified with inulin to increase soluble fiber, minerals, and vitamins. Physico-chemical analyses and 9 wk shelf life for viability of probiotics and changes in pH and viscosity were carried out for formulations with (F) and without (C) fortification. Results of the shelf life study showed that both L. casei and Bifidobacterium remained at therapeutic levels: 4.8 x 10(6) CFU/g (F), 4.3 x 10(6) CFU/g (C) and 3.1 x 10(6) CFU/g (F), 3.17 x 10(6) CFU/g (C) after 9 wk. However L. acidophilus did not survive after 3 wk. Viscosity and pH decreased significantly during the study with the difference between formulations also significant for pH (P < 0.0001). Scanning electron microscopy of samples revealed that the pre-polymerized whey protein played a major role in the structure of the gel with an increased protein network structure visible at higher PWP levels. A consumer acceptability study showed that the product was "fair" for all organoleptic attributes.
TI  - Growth inhibition of oral mutans streptococci and candida by commercial probiotic lactobacilli--an in vitro study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotic bacteria are suggested to play a role in the maintenance of oral health. Such health promoting bacteria are added to different commercial probiotic products. The aim of the study was to investigate the ability of a selection of lactobacilli strains, used in commercially available probiotic products, to inhibit growth of oral mutans streptococci and C. albicans in vitro. METHODS: Eight probiotic lactobacilli strains were tested for growth inhibition on three reference strains and two clinical isolates of mutans streptococci as well as two reference strains and three clinical isolates of Candida albicans with an agar overlay method. RESULTS: At concentrations ranging from 109 to 105 CFU/ml, all lactobacilli strains inhibited the growth of the mutans streptococci completely with the exception of L. acidophilus La5 that executed only a slight inhibition of some strains at concentrations corresponding to 107 and 105 CFU/ml. At the lowest cell concentration (103 CFU/ml), only L. plantarum 299v and L. plantarum 931 displayed a total growth inhibition while a slight inhibition was seen for all five mutans streptococci strains by L. rhamnosus LB21, L. paracasei F19, L. reuteri PTA 5289 and L. reuteri ATCC 55730. All the tested lactobacilli strains reduced candida growth but the effect was generally weaker than for mutans streptococci. The two L. plantarum strains and L. reuteri ATCC 55730 displayed the strongest inhibition on Candida albicans. No significant differences were observed between the reference strains and the clinical isolates. CONCLUSION: The selected probiotic strains showed a significant but somewhat varying ability to inhibit growth of oral mutans streptococci and Candida albicans in vitro.
TI  - Bacteriocins produced by L. Fermentum and L. Acidophilus can inhibit cephalosporin resistant e. Coli.
AB  - Reemerging infections occur due to resistant bacteria. Such infections create restrictions for clinicians and microbiologists in drug selection. Such problems demand new strategies for solution. Use of bacteriocins for this purpose may be fruitful. In the present research work, the inhibitory effects of bactericins on cephalosporin resistant Escherichia coli are used as model system for the control of antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacteria. Cephalosporin resistant Escherichia coli strain was isolated from pus by using conventional methodology. For bacteriocin production, Lactobacilli strains were selected by using selective media. Out of seventy two strains isolated from yogurt, fecal materials of human, chick, parrot and cat, only two strains (strain 45 and strain 52) were found to produce bacteriocins having antimicrobial potential against cephalosporin resistant Escherichia coli. Biochemical characterization showed that strain 45 belonged to group of Lactobacillus fermentum and strain 52 to Lactobacillus acidophilus. Both strains showed maximum growth at 25 degrees C and 35 degrees C respectively. Suitable pH was 5.5 and 6.0 for Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus acidophilus respectively. Bacteriocins produced by both strains were found stable at 50, 75 and 100 degrees C for 60min. Function of bacteriocin was also not disturbed due to change in pH. These findings suggest that bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus acidophilus can be used for the infection control of cephalosporin resistant Escherichia coli.
TI  - Effect of live Lactobacillus plantarum L2 on TNF-alpha-induced MCP-1 production in Caco-2 cells.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum is a commensal bacterium that is known to ameliorate intestinal injury and inflammation caused by a wide variety of enteric pathogens. We hypothesized that L. plantarum may exert its probiotic effects by attenuation of pro-inflammatory signaling induced by TNF-alpha. Caco-2 cells were stimulated with TNF-alpha in the presence of L. plantarum L2 and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA. The protein and mRNA levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, MCP-1, were measured by ELISA and RT-PCR, respectively. The effect of Lactobacillus bacteria on IkappaBalpha degradation was further studied by western blotting. L. plantarum L2 and L. acidophilus LA had no effect on mRNA expression and production of MCP-1 in Caco-2 cells. A significant elevation in MCP-1 mRNA and protein expression in Caco-2 cells was detected after a 4h exposure to TNF-alpha. Pre-incubation of Caco-2 cells with L. plantarum L2 for 2h resulted in an attenuation of both MCP-1 protein production and mRNA expression in TNF-alpha-stimulated cells. L. plantarum L2 also prevented IkappaBalpha degradation in TNF-alpha-stimulated Caco-2 cells. L. plantarum L2 inhibited MCP-1 secretion and mRNA expression via a NF-kappaB dependent pathway by interfering with IkappaBalpha degradation in TNF-alpha-stimulated Caco-2 cells.
TI  - [Kinetics of bioconversion of linoleic acid to conjugated linoleic acid by permeabilized Lactobacillus acidophilus cells].
AB  - In this study, we analyzed the kinetics of bioconversion of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) by permeabilized Lactobacillus acidophilus cells. The effects of cell mass, linoleic acid (LA) concentration, reaction pH and temperature on the bioconversion of CLA by permeabilized cells were investigated and the model system of bioconversion of CLA was established. The results showed that the production of CLA was increased by permeabilized cells. The optimal cell mass, pH and temperature of bioconversion of CLA were 10 x 10(10) ufc/mL, 4.5 and 45 degrees C, respectively. A marked LA inhibition phenomenon existed, and the early reaction rate of producing CLA reached the maximum (17.8 microg/mL x min) when LA concentration was 0.6 mg/mL. Michaelis constant was obtained by double-reciprocal plot and Hanes-Woolf plot. The reaction rate equation followed the classic Michaelis-Mentent equation at the low LA concentration, while there was a marked LA inhibition phenomenon at the high LA concentration. With the evaluated model parameters, the model system appeared to provide a description for the bioconversion of CLA by permeabilized Lactobacillus acidophilus cells.
TI  - Functional roles of aggregation-promoting-like factor in stress tolerance and adherence of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM.
AB  - Aggregation-promoting factors (Apf) are secreted proteins that have been associated with a diverse number of functional roles in lactobacilli, including self-aggregation, the bridging of conjugal pairs, coaggregation with other commensal or pathogenic bacteria, and maintenance of cell shape. In silico genome analysis of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM identified LBA0493 as a 696-bp apf gene that encodes a putative 21-kDa Apf protein. Transcriptional studies of NCFM during growth in milk showed apf to be one of the most highly upregulated genes in the genome. In the present study, reverse transcriptase-quantitative PCR (RT-QPCR) analysis revealed that the apf gene was highly induced during the stationary phase compared to that during the logarithmic phase. To investigate the functional role of Apf in NCFM, an Delta apf deletion mutant was constructed. The resulting Delta apf mutant, NCK2033, did not show a significant difference in cell morphology or growth compared to that of the NCFMDelta upp reference strain, NCK1909. The autoaggregation phenotype of NCK2033 in planktonic culture was unaffected. Additional phenotypic assays revealed that NCK2033 was more susceptible to treatments with oxgall bile and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Survival rates of NCK2033 decreased when stationary-phase cells were exposed to simulated small-intestinal and gastric juices. Furthermore, NCK2033 in the stationary phase showed a reduction of in vitro adherence to Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells, mucin glycoproteins, and fibronectin. The data suggest that the Apf-like proteins may contribute to the survival of L. acidophilus during transit through the digestive tract and, potentially, participate in the interactions with the host intestinal mucosa.
TI  - Transcriptional analysis of genes associated with stress and adhesion in Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM during the passage through an in vitro gastrointestinal tract model.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the transcription of genes associated with stress and adhesion in Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM during the passage through an in vitro gastrointestinal tract model. As acidified milk exerted a protective effect on the bacteria leading to increased survival, the gene expression studies were carried out with pre-inoculation of L. acidophilus NCFM in acidified milk. The induction of the genes encoding the stress-related proteins GroEL, DnaK and ClpP, and adhesion-related genes encoding mucin-binding proteins, fibronectin-binding protein and S-layer was analyzed by real-time PCR. The genes encoding GroEL, DnaK and ClpP were significantly up-regulated (9- to 16-fold) during gastric digestion and declined upon subsequent duodenal digestion. The genes encoding mucin-binding proteins and fibronectin-binding protein were not influenced by saliva and gastric juice, but they were significantly upregulated during incubation in duodenal juice and bile (6- to 7-fold). A significant induction of the gene encoding the S-layer protein was not detected. Our results give a better understanding of the functionality of L. acidophilus NCFM and other probiotics during passage through the gastrointestinal tract; hence, they provide an implementable basis for the selection of prospective probiotic candidates.
TI  - [Identification of anaerobic bacteria isolated from various clinical specimens and determination of antibiotic susceptibilities].
AB  - Routine isolation, identification and susceptibility testing of anaerobic bacteria present several difficulties leading to defects in the determination of local susceptibility patterns which will guide empirical treatment protocols. This study was carried out to identify the anaerobic bacteria isolated from various clinical materials obtained from the suspected patients with anaerobic infection and to determine the antibiotic susceptibilities against several antibiotics. One hundred clinical specimens (36 blood, 31 abscess, 12 peritoneal fluid, 7 joint fluid, 7 pleural fluid, 3 biopsies, 3 cerebrospinal fluids and 1 surgical wound) that were examined in our laboratory during March 20-October 30 2007, were included in the study. The specimens were collected and transported under anaerobic conditions and inoculated to conventional aerobic media and to Wilkins Chalgren agar, Schaedler agar and chopped-meat broth for anaerobic isolation. Isolated anaerobic bacteria were identified with API 20A panels (Bio-Merieux, France) via conventional methods and by the help of AN-IDENT Discs (Oxoid, England). Penicillin G, clindamycin, cefoxitin, metronidazole, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem susceptibility tests were performed with E- test method. Twenty two anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 14 clinical specimens; 7 of the specimens yielding the growth of more than one type of anaerobic bacteria and 8 specimens yielding both anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial (4 Escherichia coli and 4 Enterococcus spp.) growth. Anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 89 abscess and in 6 peritoneal fluid specimens. The distribution of the anaerobic bacteria identified among these specimens were as follows: Bacteroides fragilis (n = 6), Bacteroides spp. other than B.fragilis (n = 4), Clostridium spp. (n = 2), Fusobacterium necrophorum/nucleatum (n = 1), Prevotella intermedia/disiens (n = 1), Peptococcus niger (n = 2), Peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 5), and Lactobacillus acidophilus/lenseii (n = 1). Beta-lactamase activity was detected only in 2 of the 6 B. fragilis isolates. All of the isolates were susceptible to imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam. The highest rate of resistance was detected against penicillin G (9/22; 41%). While anaerobic gram-positive cocci (n = 7) were found to be sensitive to all antibiotics, the rate of resistance among anaerobic gram-negative bacilli were 75% (9/12) to penicillin, 33.3% (4/12) to clindamycin, 8.3% (1/12) to metronidazole. Among anaerobic gram-positive bacilli (n = 3), 2 were resistant to metronidazole, one to clindamycin and one to cefoxitin. The results of this first anaerobic antimicrobial susceptibility testing study performed at Konya area in Turkey revealed that penicillin was not appropriate in empirical treatment of anaerobic infections, clindamycin susceptibility should be tested before use, metronidazole and cefoxitin could be used in empirical treatment and imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam should be saved for the treatment of complicated infections and infections caused by resistant bacteria.
TI  - Bifidobacterium bifidum actively changes the gene expression profile induced by Lactobacillus acidophilus in murine dendritic cells.
AB  - Dendritic cells (DC) play a pivotal regulatory role in activation of both the innate as well as the adaptive immune system by responding to environmental microorganisms. We have previously shown that Lactobacillus acidophilus induces a strong production of the pro-inflammatory and Th1 polarizing cytokine IL-12 in DC, whereas bifidobacteria do not induce IL-12 but inhibit the IL-12 production induced by lactobacilli. In the present study, genome-wide microarrays were used to investigate the gene expression pattern of murine DC stimulated with Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and Bifidobacterium bifidum Z9. L. acidophilus NCFM strongly induced expression of interferon (IFN)-beta, other virus defence genes, and cytokine and chemokine genes related to the innate and the adaptive immune response. By contrast, B. bifidum Z9 up-regulated genes encoding cytokines and chemokines related to the innate immune response. Moreover, B. bifidum Z9 inhibited the expression of the Th1-promoting genes induced by L. acidophilus NCFM and had an additive effect on genes of the innate immune response and Th2 skewing genes. The gene encoding Jun dimerization protein 2 (JDP2), a transcription factor regulating the activation of JNK, was one of the few genes only induced by B. bifidum Z9. Neutralization of IFN-beta abrogated L. acidophilus NCFM-induced expression of Th1-skewing genes, and blocking of the JNK pathway completely inhibited the expression of IFN-beta. Our results indicate that B. bifidum Z9 actively inhibits the expression of genes related to the adaptive immune system in murine dendritic cells and that JPD2 via blocking of IFN-beta plays a central role in this regulatory mechanism.
TI  - Drivers of liking for yogurt drinks with prebiotics and probiotics.
AB  - Several studies have addressed the sensory properties of yogurt. However, as the  market for yogurt continues to expand and new varieties of yogurt with novel ingredients emerge, additional sensory tests are needed to ensure the quality of the products. Three selected prebiotics, soluble corn fiber, polydextrose, and chicory inulin, were each added at an excellent source of fiber (5 g fiber/serving) or a good fiber source (2.5 g fiber/serving) levels into a yogurt drink base. Three additional yogurt drinks contained 5 g of each of the separate prebiotics along with a mixture of probiotics (Bifidobacterium lactis Bb-12 and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5). A control sample with no prebiotics or probiotics was also included in the experimental design. Yogurt drinks were evaluated by 110 consumers for overall acceptance, acceptance of aroma, appearance, taste, and texture, and purchase intent. Demographic information pertaining to consumer knowledge of prebiotics and probiotics was collected. Consumer data were correlated with previously obtained descriptive analysis data to identify drivers of liking. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA), Fisher's least significant difference (LSD), cluster analysis, internal preference mapping, and external preference mapping. Total variance explained by the internal and external preference maps were 32.2% and 64.6%, respectively, which showed higher levels of the prebiotics with probiotics drove consumer liking compared to lower levels without probiotics. In terms of ingredients added, chicory inulin and polydextrose were preferred over soluble corn fiber. Yogurt drinks with these prebiotics included and probiotics were characterized by a medium level of sweetness and high viscosity. Development of new prebiotic and probiotic containing drinkable yogurts should strive for a medium level of sweetness and high viscosity for maximum consumer acceptance.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus induces virus immune defence genes in murine dendritic  cells by a Toll-like receptor-2-dependent mechanism.
AB  - Lactobacilli are probiotics that, among other health-promoting effects, have been ascribed immunostimulating and virus-preventive properties. Certain Lactobacillus spp. have been shown to possess strong interleukin-12 (IL-12) -inducing properties. As IL-12 production depends on the up-regulation of type I interferons (IFNs), we hypothesized that the strong IL-12-inducing capacity of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM in murine bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs) is caused by an up-regulation of IFN-beta, which subsequently induces IL-12 and the double-stranded RNA binding Toll-like receptor-3 (TLR-3). The expression of the genes encoding IFN-beta, TLR-3, IL-12 and IL-10 in DCs upon stimulation with L. acidophilus NCFM was determined. Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM induced a much stronger expression of Ifn-beta, Il-12 and Il-10 compared with the synthetic double-stranded RNA ligand Poly I:C, whereas the levels of expressed Tlr-3 were similar. Whole genome microarray gene expression analysis revealed that other genes related to viral defence were significantly up-regulated and among the strongest induced genes in DCs stimulated with L. acidophilus NCFM. The ability to induce IFN-beta was also detected in another L. acidophilus strain (X37), but was not a property of other probiotic strains tested, i.e. Bifidobacterium bifidum Z9 and Escherichia coli Nissle 1917. The IFN-beta expression was markedly reduced in TLR-2(-/-) DCs, dependent on endocytosis, and the major cause of the induction of Il-12 and Tlr-3 in DCs stimulated with L. acidophilus NCFM. Collectively, our results reveal that certain lactobacilli trigger the expression of viral defence genes in DCs in a TLR-2 manner dependent on IFN-beta.
TI  - Probiotics in pregnant women to prevent allergic disease: a randomized, double-blind trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous reports have suggested that certain probiotics given to mothers and children at risk of atopy halves the incidence of atopic dermatitis (AD) at 2 years of age. OBJECTIVES: To examine if probiotics given to pregnant women in a nonselected population could prevent atopic sensitization or allergic diseases during the child's first 2 years. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind trial of children from a nonselected maternal population (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00159523), women received probiotic milk or placebo from 36 weeks of gestation to 3 months postnatally during breastfeeding. The probiotic milk contained Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. acidophilus La-5 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bb-12. Children with an itchy rash for more than 4 weeks were assessed for AD. At 2 years of age, all children were assessed for atopic sensitization, AD, asthma and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was enabled by multiple imputations. RESULTS: Four hundred and fifteen pregnant women were computer randomized. At 2 years, 138 and 140 children in the probiotic and the placebo groups, respectively, were assessed. In the ITT analysis, the odds ratio (OR) for the cumulative incidence of AD was 0.51 in the probiotic group compared with the placebo [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30-0.87; P=0.013]. There were no significant effects on asthma (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.26-1.80; P=0.437) or atopic sensitization (OR 1.52, 95% CI 0.74-3.14; P=0.254). CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics given to nonselected mothers reduced the cumulative incidence of AD, but had no effect on atopic sensitization.
TI  - Cell-bound exopolysaccharide from probiotic bacteria induces autophagic cell death of tumour cells.
AB  - AIM: Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are beneficial micro-organisms that have been associated with several probiotic effects in both humans and animals. Here, using proteome analysis, we investigate the antitumour effects of cell-bound exopolysaccharides (cb-EPS) isolated from Lactobacillus acidophilus 606 on colon cancer cells and explore the proteins critical for their antitumour activity. METHODS AND RESULTS: cb-EPS inhibited the proliferation of HT-29 colon cancer cells by directly affecting cell morphology and not the cell cycle. Using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) and immunoblot analysis, we found that cb-EPS dramatically induced Beclin-1 and GRP78, and affected Bcl-2 and Bak regulation. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that cb-EPS are antitumourigenic against HT-29 colon cancer cells and that this activity is because of the activation of autophagic cell death promoted directly by the induction of Beclin-1 and GRP78, as well as indirectly through the induction of Bcl-2 and Bak. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These results may contribute to understanding the novel mechanisms by which probiotic bacteria induce tumour cell death via autophagy.
TI  - Synbiotic effects of lactitol and Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM in a semi-continuous colon fermentation model.
AB  - The effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM, lactitol, and the combination of lactitol and L. acidophilus NCFM were studied with a semi-continuous colon fermentation simulation; consisting of compartments mimicking, ascending, transverse, descending and sigmoid colon and their conditions with faecal inoculation. L. acidophilus NCFM was detected throughout the colon simulator. Lactitol was utilised early on by the microbes in the proximal part of the simulator. Lactitol increased the total numbers of microbes and bifidobacteria, and decreased clostridia cluster IV, while L. acidophilus NCFM alone decreased the numbers of clostridia cluster XIV. Combination treatment increased the numbers of bifidobacteria. Furthermore, concentrations of acetic acid, butyric acid and the sum of total short-chain fatty acids were increased by both lactitol-including treatments. The treatment with L. acidophilus NCFM alone increased the concentration of propionic acid and butyric acid. L. acidophilus NCFM tended to increase the total concentrations of biogenic amines, while lactitol suppressed production of biogenic amines also in the presence of L. acidophilus NCFM. True synergistic effects are suggested in stimulation of the production of butyrate, an important microbial metabolite for colon health. In conclusion, lactitol as well as the combination of lactitol and L. acidophilus NCFM were found to exhibit complementary beneficial effects on the colon microbial composition and activity.
TI  - Anti-inflammatory properties of probiotic bacteria on Salmonella-induced IL-8 synthesis in enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells.
AB  - Invasion of the gut by pathogenic Salmonella leads to production of IL-8 that initiates inflammatory reactions to combat the bacterium. However, its persistent production causes tissue damage and interventions that suppress IL-8 production prevent tissue damage. We hypothesised that probiotics could mediate their benefits via inhibition of IL-8 synthesis. Caco-2 cells were infected with probiotic Bifidobacterium infantis W52, Lactobacillus casei W56, Lactococcus lactis W58, Lactobacillus acidophilus W70, Bifidobacterium bifidum W23, or Lactobacillus salivarius W24 or pathogenic Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis 857 at 0, 0.2, 1, 2, 10, 20, 100 or 200 bacterial cells/Caco-2 cell for 1 hour. Cells were also exposed to a combination of one probiotic bacterium (200 bacterial cells/Caco-2 cell) and the graded numbers of Salmonella as either co-incubation (1 hour) or pre-incubation of the probiotic bacterium (1 hour) followed by Salmonella (1 hour). The cells recovered for 2 or 24 hours. IL-8 and Hsp70 were determined by ELISA and Western blot respectively. Both probiotics and Salmonella induced a dose- and time-dependent synthesis of IL-8 but probiotics induced far lower IL-8 levels than Salmonella. The Salmonella-induced IL-8 was significantly suppressed by B. infantis W52, L. casei W56 and L. lactis W58 at low numbers of Salmonella (0.2 to 20 bacterial cells/Caco-2 cell) and within 2 hours of recovery. The observed probiotic-mediated reduction in IL-8 secretion was transient, and lost after a few hours. In addition, these three probiotics induced a significant increase in Hsp70 expression while L. acidophilus W70, B. bifidum W23 and L. salivarius W24 induced a weak Hsp70 expression and could not suppress the Salmonella-induced IL-8 synthesis. We conclude that suppression of Salmonella-induced IL-8 synthesis by Caco-2 cells is exhibited by probiotics that induce expression of Hsp70, suggesting that the protective role of probiotics could be mediated, at least in part, via Hsp70 expression. This suppression is limited to a low number of infecting pathogenic Salmonella.
TI  - Comparing the efficacy of plasmid curing agents in Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - This study was mainly focused on plasmid profiling and plasmid characterisation of Lactobacillus acidophilus isolated from molasses. The secondary objective was to observe the efficacy of the plasmid curing agents acriflavine, ethidium bromide, novobiocin and SDS on L. acidophilus. Plasmid-free strains and cured derivatives harbouring only a single plasmid (6.2 kbp) were also obtained. Treatment of L. acidophilus with novobiocin at concentrations of 2.4 microg/ml could produce a large number of chloramphenicol- variants at a very high frequency (4.6%). These curing data confirmed that novobiocin acts as an effective curing agent for L. acidophilus.
TI  - Mechanical non-surgical treatment of peri-implantitis: a single-blinded randomized longitudinal clinical study. II. Microbiological results.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Peri-implantitis is common in patients with dental implants. We performed a single-blinded longitudinal randomized study to assess the effects of mechanical debridement on the peri-implant microbiota in peri-implantitis lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An expanded checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization assay encompassing 79 different microorganisms was used to study bacterial counts before and during 6 months following mechanical treatment of peri-implantitis in 17 cases treated with curettes and 14 cases treated with an ultrasonic device. Statistics included non-parametric tests and GLM multivariate analysis with p<0001 indicating significance and 80% power. RESULTS: At selected implant test sites, the most prevalent bacteria were: Fusobacterium nucleatum sp., Staphylococci sp., Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Helicobacter pylori, and Tannerella forsythia. 30 min. after treatment with curettes, A. actinomycetemcomitans (serotype a), Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus anginosus, and Veillonella parvula were found at lower counts (p<0.001). No such differences were found for implants treated with the ultrasonic device. Inconsistent changes occurred following the first week. No microbiological differences between baseline and 6-month samples were found for any species or between treatment study methods in peri-implantitis. CONCLUSIONS: Both methods failed to eliminate or reduce bacterial counts in peri-implantitis. No group differences were found in the ability to reduce the microbiota in peri-implantitis.
TI  - Comparison between killed and living probiotic usage versus placebo for the prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis and sepsis in neonates.
AB  - The aim of the study is to compare the role of killed (KP) Lactobacillus acidophilus with living (LP) in reducing incidence of sepsis (NS) and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in neonates. Randomized double blind placebo study, included 150 neonates admitted to NICU at day 1, sixty received oral (LP) and 60 received (KP) and 30 received placebo. One gram of stools was collected on admission, at day 7, at end of the study, as well as on suspected NEC or NS and was sent for culture. RESULTS: LP and KP were preventive factors for NEC with absolute risk reduction (AAR) 16, 15%, respectively and 18% for NS compared to placebo. Incidence of NEC and NS did not differ significantly between neonates supplemented with LP and those with KP. Preterm neonates supplemented with KP showed significantly lower incidence of NEC compared to placebo, while incidence of NS showed no significant difference between both groups. There is significant reduction in NS and NEC among neonates with positive Lactobacillus colonization of gut compared to those none colonized at day 7 (27.9 vs. 85.9%, 0 vs. 7.8%) and at day 14 (48.7 vs. 91.7% for NS and 0 vs. 20.8% for NEC). Overall comparison between the three groups showed statistical significant reduction in the incidence of NEC. Present conclusions are that early gut colonization with beneficial bacteria lowers the incidence of NEC and NS. KP retained similar benefits to live bacteria.
TI  - Genetic and proteomic analysis of factors affecting serum cholesterol reduction by Lactobacillus acidophilus A4.
AB  - This article identifies novel factors involved in cholesterol reduction by probiotic bacteria, which were identified using genetic and proteomic approaches. Approximately 600 Lactobacillus acidophilus A4 mutants were created by random mutagenesis. The cholesterol-reducing ability of each mutant was determined and verified using two different methods: the o-phthalaldehyde assay and gas chromatographic analysis (GC). Among screened mutants, strain BA9 showed a dramatically diminished ability to reduce cholesterol, as demonstrated by a 7.7% reduction rate, while the parent strain had a more than 50% reduction rate. The transposon insertion site was mapped using inverse PCR (I-PCR), and it was determined using bioinformatic methods that the deleted region contained the Streptococcus thermophilus catabolite control protein A gene (ccpA). In addition, we have shown using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) that several proteins, including a transcription regulator, FMN-binding protein, major facilitator superfamily permease, glycogen phosphorylase, the YknV protein, and fructose/tagatose bisphosphate aldolase, were strongly regulated by the ccpA gene. In addition, in vivo experiments investigating ccpA function were conducted with rats. Rats fed wild-type L. acidophilus A4 showed a greater than 20% reduction in total serum cholesterol, but rats fed BA9 mutant L. acidophilus showed only an approximately 10% reduction in cholesterol. These results provide important insights into the mechanism by which these lactic acid bacteria reduce cholesterol.
TI  - Enhanced growth of lactobacilli in soymilk upon immobilization on agrowastes.
AB  - Cell immobilization is an alternative to microencapsulation for the maintenance of cells in a liquid medium. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of agrowastes from durian (Durio zibethinus), cempedak (Artocarpus champeden), and mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana) as immobilizers for lactobacilli grown in soymilk. Rinds from the agrowastes were separated from the skin, dried, and ground (150 microm) to form powders and used as immobilizers. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that lactobacilli cells were attached and bound to the surface of the immobilizers. Immobilized cells of Lactobacillus acidophilus FTDC 1331, L. acidophilus FTDC 2631, L. acidophilus FTDC 2333, L. acidophilus FTDC 1733, and L. bulgaricus FTCC 0411 were inoculated into soymilk, stored at room temperature (25 degrees C) and growth properties were evaluated over 168 h. Soymilk inoculated with nonimmobilized cells was used as the control. Utilization of substrates, concentrations of lactic and acetic acids, and changes in pH were evaluated in soymilk over 186 h. Immobilized lactobacilli showed significantly better growth (P < 0.05) compared to the control, accompanied by higher production of lactic and acetic acids in soymilk. Soymilk containing immobilized cells showed greater reduction of soy sugars such as stachyose, raffinose, sucrose, fructose, and glucose compared to the control (P < 0.05).
TI  - Enhancing the biotransformation of isoflavones in soymilk supplemented with lactose using probiotic bacteria during extended fermentation.
AB  - Soymilk (SM) lacks lactose; hence supplementation of SM with lactose is likely to enhance the growth of probiotic bacteria and biotransformation of isoflavone glycosides to isoflavone aglycones. In this study, 11 strains of probiotic bacteria including Lactobacillus rhamnosus, L. salivarius, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. paracasei, HOWARU L. rhamnosus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium lactis type Bi-07, B. longum, HOWARU B. bifidum, and B lactis type Bi-04 were inoculated individually or as mixed cultures into SM and soymilk supplemented with lactose (SML). A total of 2% of lactose was added to 1 L of SM with the aim of improving the growth of probiotic organisms and promoting the biotransformation of isoflavone isomers to bioactive isoflavone aglycomes. Samples of SM were incubated at 37 degrees C and 10 mL aliquots of SM were taken at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h to monitor the growth of probiotic bacteria and changes in isoflavone contents using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results indicated that SML fermented with probiotics had higher viable counts by >2.4 log CFU/mL than that in SM at the end of the 72 h fermentation period. Mixed cultures grew at different rates and in general Lactobacilius spp. had >1.02 log CFU/mL more cells than Bifidobacterium spp. at the end of the fermentation period. The total aglycone content in SM at 72 h of fermentation was 0.924 mg/100 mL, whereas that in SML was 1.623 mg/100 mL. Addition of lactose not only improved the growth of probiotic bacteria in SM but also enhanced the biotransformation of isoflavone glucosides to the more bioactive isoflavone aglycones. Mixed cultures did not improve the biotransformation of bioactive isoflavones when compared to single cultures.
TI  - Competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the competition between probiotics in bio-yogurt and periodontal pathogens in vitro. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of bio-yogurt was studied by agar diffusion assays, using eight species of putative periodontal pathogens and a 'protective bacteria' as indicator strains. Four probiotic bacterial species (Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium) were isolated from yogurt and used to rate the competitive exclusion between probiotics and periodontal pathogens. RESULTS: Fresh yogurt inhibited all the periodontal pathogens included in this work, showing inhibition zones ranging from 9.3 (standard deviation 0.6) mm to 17.3 (standard deviation 1.7) mm, whereas heat-treated yogurt showed lower antimicrobial activity. In addition, neither fresh yogurt nor heat-treated yogurt inhibited the 'protective bacteria', Streptococcus sanguinis. The competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens depended on the sequence of inoculation. When probiotics were inoculated first, Bifidobacterium inhibited Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas circumdentaria, and Prevotella nigrescens; L. acidophilus inhibited P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. circumdentaria, P. nigrescens, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius; L. bulgaricus inhibited P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and P. nigrescens; and S. thermophilus inhibited P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, and P. nigrescens. However, their antimicrobial properties were reduced when both species (probiotics and periodontal pathogens) were inoculated simultaneously. When periodontal pathogens were inoculated first, Prevotella intermedia inhibited Bifidobacterium and S. thermophilus. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that bio-yogurt and the probiotics that it contains are capable of inhibiting specific periodontal pathogens but have no effect on the periodontal protective bacteria.
TI  - Functional fermented whey-based beverage using lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Whey protein concentrate (WPC) is employed as functional food ingredient because  of its nutritional value and emulsifying properties. However, the major whey protein beta-lactoglobulin (BLG) is the main cause of milk allergy. The aim of this study was to formulate a fermented whey beverage using selected lactic acid bacteria and WPC35 (WPC containing 35% of proteins) to obtain a fermented product with low lactose and BLG contents and high essential amino acid concentration. Cell viability, lactose consumption, lactic acid production, proteolytic activity, amino acid release and BLG degradation by the selected strains Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 636, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CRL 656 and Streptococcus thermophilus CRL 804, as single or mixed (SLaB) cultures were evaluated in WPC35 (10%, w/v) incubated at 37 degrees C for 24h. Then, the fermented WPC35 was mixed with peach juice and calcium lactate (2%, w/v) and stored at 10 degrees C for 28 days. During fermentation, single cultures grew 1.7-3.1 log CFU/ml and produced 25.1-95.0 mmol/l of lactic acid as consequence of lactose consumption (14.0-41.8 mmol/l) after 12h fermentation. L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CRL 656 was the most proteolytic strain (626 microg/ml Leu) and released the branched-chain essential amino acids Leu (16 microg/ml), Ile (27 microg/ml) and Val (43 microg/ml). All strains were able to degrade BLG in a range of 41-85% after 12h incubation. The starter culture SLaB grew 3.0 log CFU/ml, showed marked pH reduction, produced 122.0 mmol/l of lactic acid, displayed high proteolytic activity (484 microg/ml Leu) releasing Leu (13 microg/ml), Ile (18 microg/ml) and Val (35 microg/ml), and hydrolyzed 92% of BLG. The addition of calcium lactate to WPC35 maintained the drink pH stable during shelf life; no contamination was detected during this period. After 28 days, a decrease in cell viability of all strains was observed being more pronounced for L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CRL 656 and L. acidophilus CRL 636 (2.3 and 1.9 log CFU/ml, respectively). The results showed that WPC fermentation by rationally selected lactic acid bacteria might be used for developing functional beverages with improved characteristics such as reduced BLG content and increased branched-chain essential amino acids.
TI  - Bioconversion of isoflavone glycosides to aglycones, mineral bioavailability and  vitamin B complex in fermented soymilk by probiotic bacteria and yeast.
AB  - AIM: To study the role of beta-glucosidase producing probiotic bacteria and yeast in the biotransformation of isoflavone glycosides to aglycones, mineral bioavailability and vitamin B complex in fermented soymilk. METHODS AND RESULTS: Five isolates of probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Lactobacillus acidophilus B4496, Lactobacillus bulgaricus CFR2028, Lactobacillus casei B1922, Lactobacillus plantarum B4495 and Lactobacillus fermentum B4655 with yeast Saccharomyces boulardii were used to ferment soymilk to obtain the bioactive isoflavones, genistein and daidzein. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to analyse the concentration of isoflavones. Bioactive aglycones genistein and daidzein after 24 and 48 h of fermentation ranged from 97.49 to 98.49% and 62.71 to 92.31% respectively with different combinations of LAB with yeast. Increase in bioavailability of minerals and vitamin B complex were also observed in fermented soymilk. CONCLUSIONS: LAB in combination with yeast S. boulardii has great potential for the enrichment of bioactive isoflavones, enhancing the viability of LAB strains, decreasing the antinutrient phytic acid and increasing the mineral bioavailability in soymilk fermentation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Fermentation of soymilk with probiotic organisms improves the bioavailability of isoflavones, assists in digestion of protein, provides more soluble calcium, enhances intestinal health and supports immune system. Increased isoflavone aglycone content in fermented soymilk improves the biological functionality of soymilk.
TI  - Assessment of bile salt effects on s-layer production, slp gene expression and some physicochemical properties of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356.
AB  - In many conditions, bacterial surface properties are changed as a result of variation in growth medium and conditions. This study examined the influence of bile salt concentrations (0-0.1%) on colony morphotype, hydrophobicity, H2O2 concentration, S-layer protein production and slpA gene expression in Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356. It was observed that two types of colonies (R and S) were in the control group and the stress condition. When the bile level increased in the medium, the amount of S type was more than the R. A stepwise increment in the bile concentration resulted in a stepwise decline in the maximum growth rate. The results showed that hydrophobicity was increased in 0.01%-0.02% bile but it was decreased in 0.1% bile. Treatment by bile (0.01%- 0.1%) profoundly decreased H2O2 formation. S-layer protein and slpA gene expression was also altered by stress condition. S-protein expression was increased in stress condition. slpA gene expression increased in 0.01%-0.05% bile and it decreased in 0.1% bile. However, we found that different of bile salt concentrations influence on morphology and some surface properties of L. acidophilus ATCC 4356. These changes were very different in the 0.1% bile. It appears that the bacteria respond abruptly to 0.1% bile.
TI  - Genetic and functional aspects of linoleate isomerase in Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - While the remarkable health effects of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) catalyzed from alpha-linoleic acid by the enzyme linoleate isomerase (LI, EC 5.2.1.5) are well recognized, how widely this biochemical activity is present and the mechanisms of its regulation in lactic acid bacteria are unknown. Although certain strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus can enrich CLA in fermented dairy products, it is unknown if other strains share this capacity. Due to its immense economic importance, this work aimed to investigate genetic aspects of CLA production in L. acidophilus for the first time. The genomic DNA from industrial and type strains of L. acidophilus were subjected to PCR and immunoblot analyses using the putative LI gene of L. reuteri ATCC 55739 as probe. The CLA production ability was estimated by gas chromatography of the biomass extracts. The presumptive LI gene from L. acidophilus ATCC 832 was isolated and sequenced. The resulting sequence shared 71% identity with that of L. reuteri and at least 99% with reported sequences from other L. acidophilus strains. All the strains accumulated detectable levels of CLA and tested positive by PCR and immunoblotting. However, no apparent correlation was observed between the yields and the hybridization patterns. The results suggest that LI activity might be common among L. acidophilus and related species and provide a new tool for screening potential CLA producers.
TI  - Comparison of expression vectors in Lactobacillus reuteri strains.
AB  - The synthesis of heterologous proteins in lactobacilli is strongly influenced by  the promoter selected for the expression. In addition, the activity of the promoters themselves may vary among different bacterial hosts. Three different promoters were investigated for their capability to drive enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression in Lactococcus lactis spp. cremoris MG1363, in Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 20016(T) and in five L. reuteri strains isolated from chicken crops. The promoters of the Lactobacillus acidophilus surface layer protein gene (slp), L. acidophilus lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldhL) and enterococcal rRNA adenine N-6-methyltransferase gene (ermB) were fused to the coding sequence of EGFP and inserted into the backbone of the pTRKH3 shuttle vector (pTRKH3-slpGFP, pTRKH3-ldhGFP, pTRKH3-ermGFP). Besides conventional analytical methods, a new quick fluorimetric approach was set up to quantify the EGFP fluorescence in transformed clones using the Qubit() fluorometer. ermB proved to be the most effective promoter in L. reuteri isolates, producing 3.90 x 10(-7) g of fluorescent EGFP (mL OD(stationary culture))(-1). Under the same conditions, the ldhL promoter produced 2.66 x 10(-7) g of fluorescent EGFP (mL OD(stationary culture))(-1). Even though the slp promoter was efficient in L. lactis spp. cremoris MG1363, it was nearly inactive both in L. reuteri DSM 20016(T) and in L. reuteri isolates.
TI  - Immune-enhancing effect of fermented Maesil (Prunus mume Siebold & Zucc.) with probiotics against Bordetella bronchiseptica in mice.
AB  - Maesil (Prunus mume) has long been used as a traditional drug and healthy food in East Asian countries. It possesses a number of beneficial biological activities including potential antimicrobial effects against pathogens. Probiotics also have antibacterial effects. Moreover, some probiotics have an important role in regulating the immune system. The present study evaluated the immune enhancing effects of fermented Maesil with probiotics (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus acidophilus) in mice, especially against Bordetella bronchiseptica, as an initial step towards the development of feed supplements for the promotion of immune activity and prevention of disease, especially in pigs. Continuous ingestion of fermented Maesil with probiotics markedly increased the macrophage ratio in peripheral blood and the T lymphocyte ratio in the spleen. In addition, antibody production against formalin-killed B. bronchiseptica significantly increased in the mice fed fermented Maesil compared with the control group. The number of leukocytes was significantly higher in the bronchio-alveolar lavage obtained from the fermented Maesil-fed animals compared to it in the control group at day 3 (maximal peak time) after experimental B. bronchiseptica infection. Moreover, at 7 day post-infection, relative messenger RNA expression levels of tumor necrosis factor- alpha and interferon-gamma were significantly increased in splenocytes of mice fed fermented Maesil compared with those in the control group. Taken together, these findings suggest that feed containing fermented Maesil with probiotics enhances immune activity in mice, especially against B. bronchiseptica, via the potent stimulation of non-specific immune responses.
TI  - Probiotics for patients with compensated liver cirrhosis: a double-blind placebo-controlled study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gut flora is related to the major complications of liver cirrhosis including hepatic encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and variceal bleeding. Prior studies have reported a beneficial effect of gut flora modification with probiotic bacteria in patients with minimal hepatic encephalopathy. We aimed to study the effect of probiotics on clinical and laboratory parameters of patients with compensated cirrhosis. METHODS: A double-blind placebo-controlled study that included patients with liver cirrhosis and at least one major complication of cirrhosis in the past, clinical evidence of portal hypertension, or decreased hepatic synthetic function. Participants were randomly assigned to receive probiotic capsules containing Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium lactis, and Streptococcus thermophiles or placebo for a period of 6 mo. RESULTS: A total of 36 patients were available for final analysis (distributed equally between the probiotic and placebo groups). The administration of probiotics was not associated with significant differences in either clinical or laboratory parameters between the two groups. Because the lack of a beneficial effect may be related to the compensated liver disease of patients, we conducted a subanalysis of patients with baseline ammonia levels > 50 mmol/L. In this subgroup, the administration of probiotics appeared to significantly reduce the ammonia levels starting after 1 mo of treatment. However, this effect diminished and lost its significance following comparison to the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Our study did not show a significant beneficial effect of probiotic supplementation in patients with compensated liver cirrhosis. Nevertheless, it points toward a possible positive effect of probiotics in patients with above normal baseline ammonia levels. This issue requires further investigation in larger cohorts.
TI  - Low levels of faecal lactobacilli in women with iron-deficiency anaemia in south  India.
AB  - Fe deficiency in women contributes significantly to maternal and child morbidity  in India. The intestinal bacterial flora may facilitate absorption of Fe from the caecum and proximal colon. The present study investigated the possibility that intestinal microbiota of anaemic young women may differ from that of women with normal Hb levels. The microbiota was quantified by real-time PCR in faeces of eight anaemic (Hb </= 100 g/l) and twenty-six normohaemic (Hb >/= 120 g/l) women aged 18-25 years. Sequences of 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) specific to Bifidobacterium genus, Lactobacillus acidophilus group, Bacteroides-Prevotella-Porphyromonas group, Clostridium leptum group and Eubacterium rectale were amplified and expressed (as relative difference) relative to the universally conserved bacterial 16S rDNA sequences. Dietary intakes of energy, carbohydrate, fibre and Fe were ascertained by maintenance of a diet diary for a week. Faecal lactobacilli were significantly lower in anaemic women (median 6.6 x 10(-8), relative difference compared with total bacteria) than in the reference group (2.9 x 10(-6); P = 0.001, unpaired t test with logarithmic transformation). There was no difference between the two groups with respect to any of the other bacteria that were examined. Intakes of energy, carbohydrate, fibre, Fe and milk were similar in both the groups. Fe deficiency in young women in south India was associated with low levels of lactobacilli in the faeces. The relationship between lactobacilli and Fe deficiency needs to be explored further.
TI  - Randomized controlled trial of live lactobacillus acidophilus plus bifidobacterium bifidum in prophylaxis of diarrhea during radiotherapy in cervical cancer patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Radiation-induced diarrhea is frequently observed during pelvic radiotherapy. This study was performed to determine the ability of a probiotic containing live lactobacillus acidophilus plus bifidobacterium bifidum to reduce the incidence of radiation-induced diarrhea in locally advanced cervical cancer patients. METHODS: Patients who were undergoing pelvic radiotherapy concurrent with weekly cisplatin were randomly assigned to a study drug or placebo, in a double-blind study. Diarrhea was graded weekly according the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) system. Stool consistency and white and red blood cell count in stool were also assessed. The primary endpoint was to reduce the incidence of diarrhea, defined by a CTC grade 2 or more, and the need for anti-diarrheal medication. RESULTS: A total of 63 patients were enrolled. Grade 2 -3 diarrhea was observed in 45% of the placebo group (n = 31) and 9% of the study drug group (n = 32) (p = 0.002). Anti-diarrheal medication use was significantly reduced in the placebo group (p = 0.03). The patients in the study drug group had a significantly improved stool consistency (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Live lactobacillus acidophilus plus bifidobacterium bifidum reduced the incidence of radiation-induced diarrhea and the need for anti-diarrheal medication and had a significant benefits on stool consistency.
TI  - The hypocholesterolaemic effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus American type culture collection 4356 in rats are mediated by the down-regulation of Niemann-Pick C1-like 1.
AB  - The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus 4356 on cholesterol metabolism in vivo. Rats were fed a cholesterol-enriched experimental diet with or without L. acidophilus 4356 supplementation at a dose of 10(9) colony-forming units per d. L. acidophilus 4356 feeding significantly lowered total serum cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and TAG concentrations, but there was no change in the serum HDL-cholesterol concentrations. In addition, total liver cholesterol and TAG were decreased in the L. acidophilus 4356-fed group. The expression of Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) in the duodenum and jejunum was significantly decreased following L. acidophilus 4356 feeding. Lactobacillus acidophilus 4356 increased the population of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in the small intestine and faeces compared with the control. These results indicate that the probiotic potential of the L. acidophilus 4356 strain in the control of cholesterol is at least partially mediated by the down-regulation of NPC1L1. Furthermore, these results also potentially suggest a new mechanism that is responsible for the cholesterol-reducing effects of probiotics.
TI  - Decrease in frequency of liquid stool in enterally fed critically ill patients given the multispecies probiotic VSL#3: a pilot trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diarrhea has adverse consequences for critically ill patients, health care staff, and health care costs. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of the multispecies probiotic VSL#3 in reducing the mean number of episodes of liquid stool in enterally fed critically ill patients. METHODS: A single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study was done in a 6-bed intensive care unit in a 330-bed public hospital in Australia. A total of 45 adults (20 intervention, 25 control) who required enteral nutrition for more than 72 hours were given VSL#3 or a placebo twice daily. The frequency (mean number of episodes per patient per day) and weight (grams per day) were determined for both liquid stool and liquid and loose (unformed) stool. RESULTS: The 2 groups of patients had no demographic or clinical differences. Patients received enteral nutrition for a mean of 8.5 days (SD, 5.4) and were studied for a mean of 11.9 days (SD, 5.6). Compared with the control group, the intervention group had a significant reduction in the frequency of liquid stools (incidence rate ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.27 to 0.93; P = .03). Smaller but still significant differences also occurred between the groups in both the frequency of episodes and the weight of liquid and loose (unformed) stool. CONCLUSION: VSL#3 was effective in reducing the frequency of liquid stool in critically ill patients receiving enteral nutrition. Probiotics possibly can minimize diarrhea in critically ill tube-fed patients, but more controlled clinical trials are needed.
TI  - Effect of probiotics on symptoms in korean adults with irritable bowel syndrome.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a troublesome disease. Some strains of probiotics reportedly exert remarkable immunomodulatory effects, and so we designed a prospective double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical study to assess their effects in Korean adults with IBS. METHODS: IBS patients who met Rome III criteria were randomly assigned to receive composite probiotics or placebo. A total of 20 billion lyophilized bacteria were administered twice daily for 8 weeks. Primary outcome variables were symptom scores consisting of abdominal pain, flatulence, defecation discomfort, and sum of symptom scores. A visual analogue scale was used to quantify the severity. Secondary outcome variables consisted of the quality of life and bowel habits including defecation frequency and stool form. RESULTS: Thirty-six and 34 patients were randomized to the probiotics and placebo groups, respectively. Intention-to-treat analysis showed significant reductions in pain after 8 weeks of treatment: -31.9 and -17.7 in the probiotics and placebo groups, respectively (p=0.045). The reductions in abdominal pain, defecation discomfort, and sum of scores were more significant in 58 patients with a score of at least 3 on the baseline stool-form scale. CONCLUSIONS: Composite probiotics containing Bifidobacterium bifidum BGN4, Lactobacillus acidophilus AD031, and other species are safe and effective, especially in patients who excrete normal or loose stools.
TI  - Inducer bacteria, unique signal peptides, and low-nutrient media stimulate in vitro bacteriocin production by Lactobacillus spp. and Enterococcus spp. Strains.
AB  - Bacteriocins (BCN) are antimicrobial peptides that provide potential to control bacterial infections in a variety of applications. We previously reported on three class IIa BCN molecules produced by Lactobacillus salivarius B-30514 (OR-7), Enterococcus faecium B-30746 (E 50-52), and Enterococcus durans/faecium/hirae B-30745 (E-760). These BCN are notably effective against a wide array of pathogenic bacteria. To commercially apply such BCN, adequate quantities must be produced and harvested. We determined that a combination of host producer synthesized signal peptides (SP) in the presence of both producer and inducer bacteria grown in a dilute fermentation medium enabled marked increases in the synthesis of BCN. These SP contained 24-30 amino acid residues with sizes ranging from 2095 to 3065 Da having the unique terminal carboxyl sequence of VKGLT. The inducer bacterial isolates used were Lactobacillus acidophilus B-30510 and Lactobacillus crispatus B-30884. We used a nutrient-limited medium of 10% brucella broth (containing 0.01% glucose) to enhance BCN production. Using the combination of these above three parameters enabled us to reproducibly harvest at least 200 mg of BCN/L of the spent fermentation broth. This information can be used to assist in the production of BCN.
TI  - The effect of nonylphenol on the growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Nonylphenol (NP) is a well-known environmental hormone recognized as detrimental to the reproductive systems of aquatic animals and humans. The effect of NP on probiotics in the human gastrointestinal tract remains unclear. This study investigated the effect of NP on the growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum. METHODS: L. acidophilus and B. bifidum were grown in anaerobic cultures. Both strains were incubated with and without NP. The dose effects of NP on the growth of both probiotics were compared, and the effects of NP on the growth of L. acidophilus and B. bifidum in different concentrations were evaluated. RESULTS: NP 5 to 10 microg/mL inhibited the growth of L. acidophilus (p < 0.05), but was ineffective at 2.5 microg/mL (p > 0.05). NP significantly inhibited the growth of B. bifidum in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.05). NP inhibited the growth of different concentrations of L. acidophilus (6.25 x 10(4); to 2.5 x 10(5); colony-forming units [CFU]/mL) and B. bifidum (1.25 x 10(9); to 5.0 x 10(9); CFU/mL) [p < 0.05]. CONCLUSIONS: Growth of L. acidophilus and B. bifidum was inhibited by NP. This finding suggests that NP may interfere with normal gastrointestinal microbiota. This may alter immunomodulation in the intestinal mucosa and may be correlated with an increase in the incidence of allergic diseases or other gastrointestinal disorders.
TI  - Development of microparticulate systems for intestinal delivery of Lactobacillus  acidophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis.
AB  - In the present study intestinal delivery systems resistant to gastric juice, loaded with the probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus LA14 and Bifidobacterium lactis BI07, were produced by the polyelectrolyte complexation. First, beads were prepared by the traditional extrusion method and nine formulations were developed using alginate as main carrier and the biopolymer, xanthan gum (XG), as hydrophilic retardant polymer or the cellulose derivative, cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP), as gastro-resistant polymer. The results showed that the incorporation of the 0.5% (w/v) of XG or the 1% (w/v) of CAP within the 3% (w/v) of alginate solution increased the survival of the probiotic bacteria in acid conditions from 63% of the freeze-dried bacteria up to 76%. Subsequently, these formula was used to prepare smaller microcapsules by means of an atomization device. Despite of the high viscosity of the biomass suspension, the spraying system produced spherical and non-aggregated microcapsules able to survive in harsh condition better than beads: the survival of the probiotic bacteria after acid incubation was 91%. The performance of the microcapsules in simulated gastric fluid (SGF) containing pepsin and in gut medium (GM) containing bile salts was excellent (viability>95%). Furthermore, the viability of probiotic bacteria was maintained after an incubation of 24h in GM. Finally, stability tests performed at 5 degrees C highlighted a bacterial viability of about 82% and 70% after 6 and 9 months, respectively.
TI  - Probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome: underachievers or underpowered?
AB  
TI  - Identification of the bacterial biodiversity in koumiss by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and species-specific polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - Bacterial biodiversity in traditional koumiss fermented milk was studied by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Target DNA bands were identified according to the reference species ladder, constructed in this study. Comigrating bands present in the DGGE profiles were resolved by species-specific PCR. The results revealed a novel bacterial profile and extensive bacterial biodiversity in koumiss. The dominant lactic acid bacteria included Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus fermentum, and Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens. Frequently encountered bacterial species were Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus kitasatonis, and Lactobacillus kefiri. Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus buchneri, and Lactobacillus jensenii were occasionally found in this product. In addition, L. buchneri, L. jensenii, and L. kitasatonis, which were never previously isolated by culture-dependent methods, were identified for the first time in the Xinjiang koumiss. Furthermore, conventional cultivation was performed by plating samples on M17, de Man-Rogosa-Sharpe, Halligan-Pearce, and Kenner fecal media. The results revealed that lactobacilli were the dominant species in the koumiss ecosystem, which was consistent with the results obtained by the DGGE analysis. This is the first systematic study of the microbial composition in koumiss, and our findings will be helpful in selecting appropriate strains for the manufacture of this product at the industrial level.
TI  - Effect of source and dose of probiotics and exogenous fibrolytic enzymes (EFE) on intake, feed efficiency, and growth of male buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) calves.
AB  - Probiotics of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Aspergillus niger and three commercial exogenous fibrolytic enzymes (EFE) were tested in vitro to select best source and optimum dose followed by in vivo studies on male buffalo calves. Bacterial (P < 0.001) and protozoal population were increased significantly (P < 0.001) with probiotics and EFE. In vitro dry matter digestibility was more (P < 0.001) on L. acidophilus and then on S. cerevisiae. Dose required for L. acidophilus and S. cerevisiae probiotics was 1 x 10(9) and 3 x 10(9) cfu/flask, respectively. Cellulase and xylanase were effective at 4,000 and 12,500 IU/kg DM. In vitro cell wall digestibility was increased (P < 0.001) when probiotics and EFE were used together. Best source and optimum dose of probiotics and EFE were fed to 18 male buffalo calves with concentrate supplement (CS). Calves were randomly divided into three groups either without probiotics and EFE (CG) or with probiotics (EG(1)) or probiotics combined with EFE (EG(2)) on wheat straw diet. Organic matter, neutral detergent fiber, and acid detergent fiber digestibility was improved significantly. Average daily weight gain (ADG) and feed efficiency were significantly higher (P < 0.001) in EG(2) than EG(1) or CG. Final body weight was 4% and 12% and feed efficiency was 2.6% or 1.6% more (P < 0.001) in EG(2) compared to CG or EG(1), respectively. Fortification of CS with probiotics and EFE together had more impact on FE and ADG in buffalo calves.
TI  - Association of Lactobacillus acidophilus with mice Peyer's patches.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To clarify the adhesion mechanism of Lactobacillus acidophilus to Peyer's patches. METHODS: Adhesion of L. acidophilus FN001 to mice Peyer's patches was studied in vitro using a fluorescent quantization method. The nature of adhesion mediator was studied by the differing effects of physical, chemical, and enzymatic pre-treatments of the bacteria and the inhibitory effects of sugars on the adhesion. The presence of lectin-like proteins on the cell surface was determined by hemagglutination assay. The effect of L. acidophilus FN001 on the inhibition of adhesion of pathogens to Peyer's patches was also studied. RESULTS: The adhesion of L. acidophilus FN001 was strongly inhibited in the presence of D-mannose and methyl-alpha-D-mannoside. Pretreatment of L. acidophilus FN001 with pepsin and trypsin decreased the adhesive capacity indicating that some cell surface proteins might be involved in the adhesion. L. acidophilus FN001 showed agglutinating activity toward the rabbit red cells in a mannose specific manner, which was decreased after protease pretreatment, suggesting possible occurrence of mannose specific lectin(s) on the L. acidophilus FN001 surface. In adhesion inhibition assay, L. acidophilus NF001, when applied to Peyer's patches first or at the same time with pathogen, significantly inhibited adhesion of Escherichia coli ATCC25922 to Peyer's patches. CONCLUSION: L. acidophilus FN001 contains some mannose-specific protein(s) on its surface that mediates its adhesion to the Peyer's patches. FN001 inhibits the adhesion of E. coli, which also contains mannose specific lectin.
TI  - Efficient one-pot enzymatic synthesis of alpha-(1-->4)-glucosidic disaccharides through a coupled reaction catalysed by Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM maltose phosphorylase.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM maltose phosphorylase (LaMalP) of glycoside hydrolase family 65 catalysed enzymatic synthesis of alpha-(1-->4)-glucosidic disaccharides from maltose and five monosaccharides in a coupled phosphorolysis/reverse phosphorolysis one-pot reaction. Thus phosphorolysis of maltose to beta-glucose 1-phosphate circumvented addition of costly beta-glucose 1-phosphate for reverse phosphorolysis with different monosaccharide acceptors, resulting in 91%, 89%, 88%, 86% and 84% yield of alpha-d-glucopyranosyl-(1-->4)-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminopyranose [N-acetyl-maltosamine], alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->4)-D-glucosaminopyranose [maltosamine], alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->4)-D-mannopyranose, alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->4)-L-fucopyranose and alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->4)-D-xylopyranose, respectively, from 0.1M maltose, 0.5M N-acetyl glucosamine, 0.1M glucosamine, 0.1M mannose, 1M L-fucose and 0.5M xylose in 0.2M phosphate-citrate pH 6.2. These current yields of 0.27-0.34 g of disaccharide products from 10 mL reaction mixtures are easy to scale up and moreover the strategy can be applied to large-scale production of other oligosaccharides from low-cost disaccharides as catalysed by phosphorylases with different substrate specificities.
TI  - The effects of an orally administered probiotic on sulfasalazine metabolism in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis: a preliminary study.
AB  - AIM: To carry out a pilot study to investigate the effect of short-term oral probiotic administration on the metabolism of sulfasalazine (SSZ) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) stabilized on SSZ. METHODS: Twelve subjects with RA taking stable doses of SSZ for a minimum of 3 months prior to the study, received a probiotic preparation contained three strains of bacteria (1.8 x 10(9) CFU/day) twice daily for 1 week. Single point blood and 12-h urine samples were taken before and after probiotic treatment and 3 weeks following discontinuation of probiotics, for determination of SSZ and its metabolites. The presence of the probiotic bacteria in the feces of patients was investigated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). RESULTS: Adverse events recorded were three instances of gastrointestinal disturbance and one flare of RA. Plasma and urinary levels of SSZ and its metabolites showed no statistically significant changes after probiotic administration and the incidence of gastrointestinal disturbance did not appear to be ascribed to higher sulfapyridine plasma levels. Probiotic-specific DGGE bands were detected in the feces of some patients after the treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term treatment of RA patients with a multi-strain probiotic did not significantly influence SSZ metabolism as has been demonstrated in animal models.
TI  - Porcine small intestinal epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2) of rotavirus infection as a new model for the study of innate immune responses to rotaviruses and probiotics.
AB  - Previous studies of epithelial immune responses to rotavirus infection have been  conducted in transformed cell lines. In this study, we evaluated a non-transformed porcine jejunum epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2) as an in-vitro model of rotavirus infection and probiotic treatment. Cell-culture-adapted porcine rotavirus (PRV) OSU strain, or human rotavirus (HRV) Wa strain, along with Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) or Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) were used to inoculate IPEC-J2 cells. LA or LGG treatment was applied pre- or post-rotavirus infection. We demonstrated that IPEC-J2 cells were productively infected by PRV. LA or LGG treatment of the cells did not reduce virus replication. PRV infection increased MUC3 mucin secretion. LGG treatment post-rotavirus infection reduced the mucin secretion response induced by PRV; LGG alone increased the production of membrane-associated MUC3 mucin. LA treatment prior to rotavirus infection significantly increased PRV replication and the IL-6 response to PRV infection, which is consistent with the adjuvant effect of LA. LGG treatment post-rotavirus infection downregulated the IL-6 response, confirming the anti-inflammatory effect of LGG. IPEC-J2 cells expressed toll-like receptor (TLR) 2, TLR3, and TLR9 constitutively. TLR2 expression was upregulated by LGG and peptidoglycan, corresponding to the decreased IL-6 response, indicating that the protective effect of LGG is associated with upregulation of TLR2 expression on intestinal epithelial cells. The IPEC-J2 cell model of PRV infection is a completely homologous system. It is a valuable model for studying the interactions among rotavirus-host-probiotics, and the mechanisms behind the immunomodulating effect of probiotic bacteria on innate immune responses.
TI  - [Probiotic properties of industrial strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria].
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were isolated from the samples of dry microbial substance "Vivolac" and identified. The lactic acid bacteria were identified as Lactobacillus acidophilus. L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. paracasei. Bifidobacteria belonged to the species Bifidobacterium animalis. Manifestation of biological activity of all studied strains was investigated. It was shown, that adhesive activity of the studied strains depended on the genus of the strain: lactobacilli manifested medium adhesiveness to buccal epithelium (medium adhesive index 2.07-2.26), bifidobacteria manifested high adhesiveness (medium adhesive index 4.11-4.76). Antagonism against pathogenic and opportunistic reference strains was manifested to a greater extent to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria were resistant to aminoglycosides. Sensitivity of the studied strains to antibiotics did not depend on the genus and species of microorganism. Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains were capable to survive in gastric juice and at different concentration of bile, which is promising for development of probiotic preparations on the basis of these strains.
TI  - Probiotics in diverticular disease of the colon: an open label study.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the effectiveness and safety of a symbiotic mixture in preventing recurrence of constipation-related abdominal pain in patients with uncomplicated diverticular disease of the colon. METHODS: Forty-six consecutive patients (10 men, 36 women, mean age 62.5 years, range 49 to 77 years), previously affected by symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease of the colon, were enrolled in a 6-month follow-up study in a prospective, randomized, open-label study. The following symptoms were assessed at entry and through follow-up by using a quantitative scale: constipation, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. After recruitment, the patients were assigned to the following treatment: SCM-III symbiotic mixture, 10 ml three times a day. The colonization of ingested Lactobacillus acidophilus 145 and Bifidobacterium spp. 420 was assessed by species-specific PCR. Forty-five patients completed the study (97%). RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (68%) were still symptom free after the 6th month of treatment. Treatment with SCM-III was regarded as "effective" or "very effective" in more than 78% of the patients altogether (p<0.01 vs baseline values). The microbiological study showed that, as compared to baseline values, SCM-III enabled a significant increase of the lactobacilli and bifidobacteria counting and a trend decrease of clostridia. Genomic analysis confirmed the survivability of the ingested strain as long as treatment was given. CONCLUSIONS: The present symbiotic mixture seems to be effective in preventing recurrence of symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease of the colon, especially in those patients with constipation-predominant features.
TI  - Probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. casei mix sensitize colorectal tumoral cells to 5-fluorouracil-induced apoptosis.
AB  - To assess the potential of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei strains to increase the apoptosis of a colorectal cancer cell line in the presence of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), LS513 colorectal cancer cells were treated for 48 h with increasing concentrations of these lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in the presence of 100 mu g/ml of 5-FU. In the presence of 10(8) CFU/ml of live LAB, the apoptotic efficacy of the 5-FU increased by 40%, and the phenomenon was dose dependent. Moreover, irradiation-inactivated LAB caused the same level of induction, whereas microwave-inactivated LAB reduced the apoptotic capacity of the 5-FU. When cells were treated with a combination of live LAB and 5-FU, a faster activation of caspase-3 protein was observed, and the p21 protein seems to be downregulated. These results suggest that live L. acidophilus and L. casei are able to increase the apoptosis-induction capacity of 5-FU. The mechanisms of action are still not elucidated, and more research is needed to understand them. This is the first set of experiments demonstrating that some strains of LAB can enhance the apoptosis-induction capacity of the 5-FU. Based on these results, it is possible to speculate that LAB or probiotics could be used as an adjuvant treatment during anticancer chemotherapy.
TI  - Effect of prebiotics on viability and growth characteristics of probiotics in soymilk.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Soy products have attracted much attention lately as carriers for probiotics. This study was aimed at enhancing the growth of probiotics in soymilk via supplementation with prebiotics. RESULTS: Lactobacillus sp. FTDC 2113, Lactobacillus acidophilus FTDC 8033, Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356, Lactobacillus casei ATCC 393, Bifidobacterium FTDC 8943 and Bifidobacterium longum FTDC 8643 were evaluated for their viability and growth characteristics in prebiotic-supplemented soymilk. In the presence of fructooligosaccharides (FOS), inulin, mannitol, maltodextrin and pectin, all strains showed viability exceeding 7 log(10) colony-forming units mL(-1) after 24 h. Their growth was significantly (P < 0.05) increased on supplementation with maltodextrin, pectin, mannitol and FOS. Additionally, supplementation with FOS, mannitol and maltodextrin increased (P < 0.05) the production of lactic acid. Supplementation with FOS and maltodextrin also increased the alpha-galactosidase activity of probiotics, leading to enhanced hydrolysis and utilisation of soy oligosaccharides. Finally, prebiotic supplementation enhanced the utilisation of simpler sugars such as fructose and glucose in soymilk. CONCLUSION: Supplementation with prebiotics enhances the potential of soymilk as a carrier for probiotics.
TI  - Induction of protective immunity against microbial challenge by targeting antigens expressed by probiotic bacteria to mucosal dendritic cells.
AB  - Efficient vaccines combined with adjuvants potentiate and enhance antibody avidity and increase T cell longevity, particularly in individuals with compromised immunity. The efficacy of a novel vaccine can be improved by specifically targeting its immunogenic subunits and expressing it in live probiotic vector (i.e. Lactobacillus acidophilus) that protects vaccine bioavailability and to induces not only mucosal but also systemic immunity against microbes. Accordingly, our data clearly show that specific Lactobacillus species (L. gasseri) not only optimally activate DCs but also deliver targeted antigens to mucosal DCs via 12-mer peptides derived from a phage display library resulting in robust humoral and T cell immunity against microbial challenge. This effort is accomplished via novel tools that provide "targeting" of the vaccine, evaluation of innovative vaccine effectiveness against a wide array of microbes, and controlling gene expression/presentation technologies in probiotic lactobacilli that can be orally consumed at high levels resulting in natural delivery of a "targeted" antigen to mucosal DCs. In this review I will discuss the potential benefits and efficacy of the employed vaccine strategy that may be feasible for various studies in the field.
TI  - Removal of cholesterol by lactobacilli via incorporation and conversion to coprostanol.
AB  - Fifteen strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium were screened based on their ability to adhere to hydrocarbons via the determination of cellular hydrophobicity. Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 314, L. acidophilus FTCC 0291, Lactobacillus bulgaricus FTCC 0411, L. bulgaricus FTDC 1311, and L. casei ATCC 393 showed greater hydrophobicity and, thus, were selected for examination of cholesterol-removal properties. All selected strains showed changes in cellular fatty acid compositions, especially total fatty acids and saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in the presence of cholesterol compared with those grown in the absence of cholesterol. In addition, we found that cells grown in media containing cholesterol were more resistant to sonication and enzymatic lysis compared with those grown without cholesterol. We further evaluated the location of the incorporated cholesterol via the insertion of fluorescence probes into the cellular membrane. In general, enrichment of cholesterol was found in the regions of the phospholipid tails, upper phospholipids, and polar heads of the cellular membrane phospholipid bilayer. Our results also showed that lactobacilli were able to reduce cholesterol via conversion of cholesterol to coprostanol, aided by the ability of strains to produce cholesterol reductase. Our results provided experimental evidence to strengthen the hypothesis that probiotics could remove cholesterol via the incorporation of cholesterol into the cellular membrane and conversion of cholesterol to coprostanol. The strains studied may be potential health adjunct cultures in fermented dairy products with possible in vivo hypocholesterolemic effects.
TI  - Differential effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus plantarum strains on cytokine induction in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
AB  - Lactic acid bacterial strains have received interest for their immunomodulating activities and potential use in probiotic products. A wide variety of strain-dependent properties have been reported, but comparative studies at the species level are scarce. The objective of this study was to assess the immunomodulatory effect of Lactobacillus species on the cytokine profiles and proliferative response of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMC), and in particular, on the comparison between the species Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus plantarum. hPBMC from healthy donors were stimulated in the presence or absence of the lactic acid bacteria, and cytokine production, surface marker staining, proliferation and cell death were determined after 1 and 4 days of culture. All Lactobacillus strains tested were capable of inducing the production of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-10, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). The bacterial strains did not differentially influence the amount of proliferating, viable, apoptotic and necrotic cells. Generally, L. plantarum showed a significantly higher induction capacity of IFN-gamma, IL-12 and TNF-alpha compared with L. acidophilus. We conclude that the variation in immunomodulatory effects between species is even larger than the variation between the strains of the same species. In addition, we demonstrate that L. plantarum strains are most potent in skewing the T-cell differentiation toward a putative Th1 response.
TI  - Probiotics and immunosenescence: cheese as a carrier.
AB  - Oral intake of specific probiotics has been reported to enhance the immunity of the elderly. Earlier studies have used milk or yoghurt as a probiotic carrier. We chose a commercial probiotic cheese to evaluate its potential as a probiotic food. Thirty-one healthy elderly volunteers (21 female, 10 male) aged from 72 to 103 (median 86) consumed a commercial probiotic cheese containing approximately 10(9) CFU day(-1) of Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 and Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM. The 4-week probiotic intervention was preceded by a 2-week consumption of probiotic-free cheese (run-in) and followed by a 4-week wash-out period with the same control cheese. The cytotoxicity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), the relative numbers of natural killer (NK) and NKT cells in the total PBMCs, and phagocytic activity were assessed. Consumption of the probiotic cheese significantly increased the cytotoxicity of NK cells. A significant increase in phagocytosis was observed for both the control and the probiotic cheese. Cheese was found to be an effective carrier for the study of probiotics, and daily consumption of the probiotic enhanced parameters of innate immunity in elderly volunteers. It remains to be determined whether this enhancement correlates with a beneficial effect on the health of the elderly population.
TI  - Can Lactobacillus acidophilus influence the adhesion capacity of Candida albicans on the combined contraceptive vaginal ring?
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to evaluate the influence of Lactobacillus acidophilus on the adhesion capacity of Candida albicans on the combined contraceptive vaginal ring (CCVR). STUDY DESIGN: Two vaginal isolates of C. albicans and an ATCC strain of lactobacilli were used. Isolated and associated yeasts and bacteria (co-aggregated) were employed on the CCVR adherence assays and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). RESULTS: Isolated yeasts and lactobacilli adhered strongly to the CCVR. After the co-aggregation, there were an increase in adhesion capacity of the yeasts (p<.001) and a diminished adhesion of the lactobacilli (p<.001). SEM showed the isolated and co-aggregated microorganisms intimately attached to the irregularities of the CCVR. CONCLUSIONS: If these findings correlated with the conditions in vivo, the use of probiotics based on L. acidophilus or its presence in the vaginal microbiota would not protect against the adhesion of C. albicans to the ring.
TI  - Intestinal Lactobacillus sp. is associated with some cellular and metabolic characteristics of blood in elderly people.
AB  - The higher counts or particular groups (Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes) of intestinal microbiota are related to host metabolic reactions, supporting a balance of human ecosystem. We further explored whether intestinal lactobacilli were associated with some principal cellular and metabolic markers of blood in 38 healthy >65-year-old persons. The questionnaire, routine clinical and laboratory data of blood indices as much as the oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) and baseline diene conjugates in low-density lipoprotein (BDC-LDL) of blood sera were explored. The PCR-based intestinal Lactobacillus sp. composition and counts of cultivable lactobacilli (LAB) were tested. The facultative heterofermentative lactobacilli (Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus paracasei) were the most frequent (89 and 97%, respectively) species found, while Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus reuteri were present in almost half of the elderly persons. The number of species simultaneously colonizing the individuals ranged from 1 to 7 (median 4). In elderly consuming probiotics the LAB counts were significantly higher than in these not consuming (median 7.8, range 4.2-10.8 vs. median 6.3, range 3.3-9.7 log cfu/g; p=0.005), adjusted (OR=1.71, CI95 1.04-2.82; p=0.035) for age and body mass index (BMI). The colonization by L. acidophilus was negatively related (r=-0.367, p=0.0275) to L. reuteri, staying significant after adjusting for age, sex and BMI (OR=0.16, CI95 0.04-0.73; p=0.018). However, the blood glucose concentration showed a tendency for a negative correlation for colonization with Lactobacillus fermentum (r=-0.309, p=0.062) adjusted for BMI (Adj. R(2)=0.181; p=0.013) but not for age and sex. The higher white blood cells (WBC) count was positively related (r=0.434, p=0.007) to presence of Lactobacillus reuteri adjusted for age, sex and BMI (Adj. R(2)=0.193, p=0.027). The lower values of ox-LDL were predicted by higher counts of cultivable lactobacilli adjusted by sex, age and BMI (r = -0.389, p = 0.016; Adj. R(2)=0.184 p=0.029). In conclusion, the pilot study of elderly persons shows that the intestinal lactobacilli are tightly associated with WBC count, blood glucose and content of ox-LDL which all serve as risk markers in pathogenesis of inflammation, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease (CVD).
TI  - Oral administration of Lactobacillus acidophilus induces IL-12 production in spleen cell culture of BALB/c mice bearing transplanted breast tumour.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria can affect the maturation of immune cells and their products not only in the gut but also on the systemic immune organs such as lymph nodes and spleen. In the present work, we studied the effects of oral administration of Lactobacillus acidophilus on the immune responses of BALB/c mice bearing transplanted breast tumour. Two groups of female inbred BALB/c mice, each containing nine mice as test and control, were used. The L. acidophilus ATCC4356 strain was inoculated in DeMan-Rogosa-Sharpe broth and cultivated for 24 h at 37 degrees C. Then, it was collected by centrifugation, and was washed and suspended in PBS. Afterwards, 0.5 ml/d of this suspension, which contained 2.7 x 108 colony forming units/ml of bacteria, was orally administered to the mice by gavage, 14 d before tumour transplantation and 30 d after that with 3-d intervals. Similar to the test mice, the control mice received an equal volume of PBS. The results showed that oral administration of L. acidophilus increased the production of IL-12 (P < 0.05) and decreased the level of transforming growth factor beta (P = 0.05) in the splenocyte culture. Moreover, the growth rate of tumour in the test mice decreased (P < 0.01), and the results of delayed-type hypersensitivity assay after 48 h were risen (P < 0.05) in comparison with the controls. Results suggest that daily consumption of L. acidophilus can improve the production of immunomodulatory cytokine IL-12 in the splenocyte culture, which was stimulated by tumour antigen in BALB/c mice bearing transplanted breast tumour. But further studies are needed to find out some other possible mechanisms of this effect.
TI  - Efficacy of BIO K+ CL1285 in the reduction of antibiotic-associated diarrhea - a  placebo controlled double-blind randomized, multi-center study.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Antibiotic associated diarrhea (AAD) is a frequently encountered adverse event following antibiotic administration. Evidence suggests that probiotics may be beneficial in preventing and decreasing the severity of AAD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Adult patients who were prescribed antibiotics for 3-14 days were enrolled from eight Canadian centers. Study treatment was randomized at a 1 : 1 ratio of BIO-K+CL1285( ((R)) ) or placebo and was administered within 24 h of initiation to 5 days after termination of antibiotherapy. Patients were followed for 21 days after last dose of study treatment. The primary outcome was severity and incidence of AAD. Severity was measured by the total number of days with diarrhea and incidence was defined as the number of patients with at least one day with diarrhea over the total number of patients enrolled in the study. RESULTS: 216 patients were randomized to BIO-K+ and 221 to placebo. The mean (SD) number of days with diarrhea was 1.19. (3.20) days for the placebo and 0.67 (2.05) days for BIO-K+CL1285( ((R)) ) (p = 0.040). Adjusted multivariate linear regression results showed that the duration of diarrhea for BIO-K+CL1285 ((R))vs. placebo was reduced by 51.5% (b[SE] = 0.515 [0.256], p = 0.045). The incidence of diarrhea was 21.8% for the BIO-K+ and 29.4% for the placebo group (OR = 0.667, p = 0.067). Multivariate logistic regression, showed that the adjusted odds ratio of AAD in patients receiving BIO-K+ vs. placebo was 0.627 (p = 0.037). Study treatment was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: BIO-K+ is effective for preventing and reducing the severity of AAD in patients receiving antibiotic therapy in a hospital setting.
TI  - Pategras cheese as a suitable carrier for six probiotic cultures.
AB  - The viability of five single-strain and one three-strain probiotic cultures was assessed during Pategras cheese ripening. Probiotics were inoculated into cheese-milk after a pre-incubation step - intended to improve their survival - or directly as a lyophilised culture; control cheeses without probiotics were also obtained. pH of probiotic and control cheeses was similar, except in probiotic cheeses containing the strain Lb. acidophilus B or the mixed culture. In these cases, the probiotic cheeses were more acid than their respective control cheeses. All the probiotics tested maintained counts above 107 cfu/g during the shelf-life settled for the product. Strains of the Lb. casei group: Lb. paracasei, Lb. casei and Lb. rhamnosus reached and kept the highest cell concentration during cheese ripening, followed by Lb. acidophilus and bifidobacteria. The direct addition of the probiotic cultures was more efficient than their inoculation after a pre-incubation step, for all the probiotics assayed. We have provided evidence that support the use of Pategras cheese as a performing food-based vehicle for probiotic bacteria.
TI  - Use of PCR primers and probes based on the 23S rRNA and internal transcription spacer (ITS) gene sequence for the detection and enumerization of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus plantarum in feed supplements.
AB  - Novel polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers designed from the 16S-23S internal  transcription spacer (ITS) rRNA and 23S rRNA genes, respectively, were used for the specific detection of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus plantarum. Molecular weights of the PCR products were 221 and 599 bp, respectively. Strains of L. acidophilus and L. plantarum obtained from the culture center, dairy products, infant stool and other samples, could be identified with these PCR primers. DNAs from other lactic acid bacteria (LAB) species including strains of Lactobacillus pentosus which was closely related to L. plantarum, and bacteria species other than LAB, would not generate the false positive results. When this PCR primer set was used for the detection of L. acidophilus and L. plantarum in feed supplement or feed starter samples, reliable results were obtained. Furthermore, when these L. acidophilus or L. plantarum specific primers were used as DNA probes for the colony hybridization of L. acidophilus and L. plantarum, the viable cells of these LAB species in culture and feed supplements or starter products could be identified and enumerized. The method described here thus offers a rapid and economic way to inspect and assure the quality of the feed supplements or fermentation starters.
TI  - Microbial risk markers for childhood caries in pediatricians' offices.
AB  - Dental caries in pre-school children has significant public health and health disparity implications. To determine microbial risk markers for this infection, this study aimed to compare the microbiota of children with early childhood caries with that of caries-free children. Plaque samples from incisors, molars, and the tongue from 195 children attending pediatricians' offices were assayed by 74 DNA probes and by PCR to Streptococcus mutans. Caries-associated factors included visible plaque, child age, race, and snacking habits. Species were detected more frequently from tooth than tongue samples. Lactobacillus gasseri (p < 0.01), Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus vaginalis, and S. mutans with Streptococcus sobrinus (all p < 0.05) were positively associated with caries. By multifactorial analysis, the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus was negatively associated with caries. Prevotella nigrescens was the only species (p < 0.05) significantly associated with caries by the 'false discovery' rate. Analysis of the data suggests that selected Lactobacillus species, in addition to mutans streptococci, are risk markers for early childhood caries.
TI  - [Construction of a recombinant Lactobacillus acidophilus expressing high levels of Helicobacter pylori adhesin Hp0410].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To construct a recombinant Lactobacillus acidophilus that expresses high levels of Helicobacter pylori (Hp) adhesin Hp0410. METHODS: The gene fragment encoding Hp0410 was amplified by PCR from the DNA of H. pylori NCTC11639 strain and cloned into the shuttle plasmid pMG36e to construct pMG36e-Hp0410, which was transformed into Lactobacillus acidophilus by electroporation. The target protein was confirmed with SDS-PAGE and silver nitrate staining and analyzed by Western blotting. The stability of the recombinant plasmid was assessed by drawing the growth curve of the recombinant Lactobacillus acidophilus. RESULTS: A 750-bp fragment was inserted into the pMG36e plasmid and transformed into Lactobacillus lactis. The transformed bacterium expressed the target protein with a relative molecular mass of about 34 kD. Western blotting confirmed that the expressed proteins could be recognized by the serum of patients with Hp infection. The recombinant plasmid pMG36e-Hp0410 exhibited good stability in the presence or absence of erythromycin. CONCLUSIONS: The recombinant Lactobacillus acidophilus with high constitutive expression of Hp0410 has been constructed successfully.
TI  - Dose-response efficacy of a proprietary probiotic formula of Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285 and Lactobacillus casei LBC80R for antibiotic-associated diarrhea and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea prophylaxis in adult patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Standard therapies for antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) have limited efficacy. Probiotic prophylaxis is a promising alternative for reduction of AAD and CDAD incidence. METHODS: In this single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-ranging study, we randomized 255 adult inpatients to one of three groups: two probiotic capsules per day (Pro-2, n=86), one probiotic capsule and one placebo capsule per day (Pro-1, n=85), or two placebo capsules per day (n=84). Each probiotic capsule contained 50 billion c.f.u. of live organisms (Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285 +Lactobacillus casei LBC80R Bio-K+ CL1285). Probiotic prophylaxis began within 36 h of initial antibiotic administration, continued for 5 days after the last antibiotic dose, and patients were followed for an additional 21 days. RESULTS: Pro-2 (15.5%) had a lower AAD incidence vs. Pro-1 (28.2%). Each probiotic group had a lower AAD incidence vs. placebo (44.1%). In patients who acquired AAD, Pro-2 (2.8 days) and Pro-1 (4.1 days) had shorter symptom duration vs. placebo (6.4 days). Similarly, Pro-2 (1.2%) had a lower CDAD incidence vs. Pro-1 (9.4%). Each treatment group had a lower CDAD incidence vs. placebo (23.8%). Gastrointestinal symptoms were less common in the treatment groups vs. placebo and in Pro-2 vs. Pro-1. CONCLUSIONS: The proprietary probiotic blend used in this study was well tolerated and effective for reducing risk of AAD and, in particular, CDAD in hospitalized patients on antibiotics. A dose-ranging effect was shown with 100 billion c.f.u., yielding superior outcomes and fewer gastrointestinal events compared to 50 billion c.f.u. (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00958308).

TI  - Efficacy of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) supplement in management of constipation among nursing home residents.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Constipation is a significant problem in the elderly, specifically nursing home and/or extended-care facility residents are reported to suffer from constipation. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are beneficial probiotic organisms that contribute to improved nutrition, microbial balance, and immuno-enhancement of the intestinal tract, as well as diarrhea and constipation effect. The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of this LAB supplement in the management of nursing home residents. METHODS: Nineteen subjects (8M, 11F; mean age 77.1 +/- 10.1) suffering with chronic constipation were assigned to receive LAB (3.0 x 10(11) CFU/g) twice (to be taken 30 minutes after breakfast and dinner) a day for 2 weeks in November 2008. Subjects draw up a questionnaire on defecation habits (frequency of defecation, amount and state of stool), and we collected fecal samples from the subjects both before entering and after ending the trial, to investigate LAB levels and inhibition of harmful enzyme activities. Results were tested with SAS and Student's t-test. RESULTS: Analysis of questionnaire showed that there was an increase in the frequency of defecation and amount of stool excreted in defecation habit after LAB treatment, but there were no significant changes. And it also affects the intestinal environment, through significantly increase (p < 0.05) fecal LAB levels. In addition, tryptophanase and urease among harmful enzyme activities of intestinal microflora were significantly decreased (p < 0.05) after LAB treatment. CONCLUSION: LAB, when added to the standard treatment regimen for nursing home residents with chronic constipation, increased defecation habit such as frequency of defecation, amount and state of stool. So, it may be used as functional probiotics to improve human health by helping to prevent constipation.
TI  - Effects of a probiotic intervention in acute canine gastroenteritis--a controlled clinical trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of a probiotic product in acute self-limiting  gastroenteritis in dogs. METHODS: Thirty-six dogs suffering from acute diarrhoea or acute diarrhoea and vomiting were included in the study. The trial was performed as a randomised, double blind and single centre study with stratified parallel group design. The animals were allocated to equal looking probiotic or placebo treatment by block randomisation with a fixed block size of six. The probiotic cocktail consisted of thermo-stabilised Lactobacillus acidophilus and live strains of Pediococcus acidilactici, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis and Lactobacillus farciminis. RESULTS: The time from initiation of treatment to the last abnormal stools was found to be significantly shorter (P = 0.04) in the probiotic group compared to placebo group, the mean time was 1.3 days and 2.2 days, respectively. The two groups were found nearly equal with regard to time from start of treatment to the last vomiting episode. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The probiotic tested may reduce the convalescence time in acute self-limiting diarrhoea in dogs.
TI  - Anti-inflammatory actions of probiotics through activating suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) expression and signaling in Helicobacter pylori infection: a novel mechanism.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In spite of the International Agency for Research on Cancer's definition that Helicobacter pylori is the definite carcinogen of gastric cancer, the simple eradication of the bug is not enough to prevent resultant gastric cancer, and increasing microbial resistance further limits the eradication application. Therefore, probiotics, non-pathogenic microbial feed that can affect the host in a beneficial manner, could be an alternate way to enhance anti-inflammation against H. pylori. However, the mechanism of their anti-inflammatory actions is still unclear. In the current study, we hypothesized that suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) signaling could be a feasible anti-inflammatory mechanism of probiotics against H. pylori infection. RESULTS: H. pylori infection or their lipopolysaccharide stimulation led to significant increased expressions of inflammatory mediators including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-8, inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 in AGS cells and pretreatment of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosis and Lactobacillus acidophilus significantly attenuated the expressions of these inflammatory mediators in accordance with the blocking action of nuclear factor-kappaB nuclear translocation. Probiotic administration increased expression of SOCS-2 and SOCS-3 and exerted the active SOCS signaling featured with earlier and higher expressions of SOCS-2 and SOCS-3. In contrast to weak inactivation of mitogen-activated protein kinases including p-38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, probiotic-induced SOCS expressions were mediated through either significant phosphorylation of signal transducers and activation of transcription (STAT)-1 and STAT-3 or simultaneous inhibition of Janus kinase (JAK)2 phosphorylation, which is known to signal SOCS-2/SOCS-3 negatively. CONCLUSION: Anti-inflammatory signals of SOCS through STAT-1/STAT-3 activation and JAK2 inactivation might be a key anti-inflammatory mechanism of probiotics, setting probiotics as a non-microbial strategy to H. pylori infection.
TI  - Fermentation of Metroxylon sagu resistant starch type III by Lactobacillus sp. and Bifidobacterium bifidum.
AB  - The in vitro fermentability of sago (Metroxylon sagu) resistant starch type III (RS(3)) by selected probiotic bacteria was investigated. Sago RS(3) with 12% RS content was prepared by enzymatic debranching of native sago starch with pullulanase enzyme, followed by autoclaving, cooling, and annealing. The fermentation of sago RS(3) by L. acidophilus FTCC 0291, L. bulgaricus FTCC 0411, L. casei FTCC 0442, and B. bifidum BB12 was investigated by observing the bacterial growth, carbohydrate consumption profiles, pH changes, and total short chain fatty acids (SCFA) produced in the fermentation media. Comparisons were made with commercial fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS), Hi-maize 1043, and Hi-maize 240. Submerged fermentations were conducted in 30 mL glass vials for 24 h at 37 degrees C in an oven without shaking. The results indicated that fermentation of sago RS(3) significantly (P < 0.05) yielded the highest count of Lactobacillus sp. accompanied by the largest reduction in pH of the medium. Sago RS(3) was significantly the most consumed substrate compared to FOS and Hi-maizes.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a multidrug-resistant microorganism and the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. The antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria against MRSA from ten human clinical isolates as well as MRSA standard strain ATCC 43300 was tested in vitro. The Lactobacillus (Lb.) strains (Lb. acidophilus CL1285((R)) and Lb. casei LBC80R) as pure cultures, which came from commercial food products were employed. The growth inhibitory effect produced by the antimicrobial activity of the lactic acid bacteria on the MRSA strains was tested on solid medium using agar diffusion methods as well as a using a liquid medium procedure that contained a mixture of MRSA and lactic acid bacteria cultures. In the latter instance, we were able to demonstrate that the direct interaction of lactic acid bacteria and MRSA in such a mixture led to the elimination of 99% of the MRSA cells after 24 h of their incubation at 37 degrees C.
TI  - Effect of stress pretreatment on survival of probiotic bacteria in gastrointestinal tract simulator.
AB  - The effect of stress pretreatment on survival of probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, and Lactobacillus fermentum ME-3 cultures was investigated in the single bioreactor gastrointestinal tract simulator (GITS). The cultures were pregrown in pH-auxostat, subjected to temperature, acid, or bile stress treatment, fast frozen in liquid nitrogen (LN(2)), and tested for survival in GITS. After LN(2) freezing the colony forming ability of L. rhamnosus GG and L. fermentum ME-3 nonstressed and stressed cells was well retained (average survival of 75.4 +/- 18.3% and 88.0 +/- 7.2%, respectively). L. acidophilus La-5 strain showed good survival of auxostat nonstressed cells after fast freezing (94.2 +/- 15.0), however the survival of stress pretreated cells was considerably lower (30.8 +/- 8.5%). All LN(2) frozen auxostat cultures survived well in the acid phase of the GIT simulation (survival 81 +/- 21%); however, after the bile phase, the colony formation ability of L. acidophilus La-5, L. rhamnosus GG, and L. fermentum ME-3 decreased by approximately 1.4 +/- 0.2, 3.8 +/- 0.3, and 3.5 +/- 1.2 logarithmic units, respectively. No statistically relevant positive effect of stress pretreatments on survival of LN(2) frozen L. acidophilus La-5, L. rhamnosus GG, and L. fermentum ME-3 in GITS was observed.
TI  - Probiotic characteristics of lactic acid bacteria isolated from kimchi.
AB  - AIMS: The present work was aimed at identifying strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from kimchi, with properties suitable for use as starter cultures in yogurt fermentation. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 2344 LAB strains were obtained from two different sources, one group consisted of commercial LAB strains from kimchi, and the second group consisted of those strains isolated from various types of kimchi. The LAB strains from both groups were screened for resistance to biological barriers (acid and bile salts), and the four most promising strains were selected. Further analysis revealed that KFRI342 of the four selected strains displayed the greatest ability to reduce the growth of the cancer cells, SNU-C4. The in vivo efficacy of strains in quinone reductase induction assay was evaluated, and the extent of DNA strand breakage in individual cells was investigated using the comet assay. Strain KFRI342 was identified as Lactobacillus acidophilus by 16S rRNA sequence analysis, showed protection against tumour initiation and imparted immunostimulation as well as protection against DNA damage. CONCLUSIONS: Strain KFRI342, which showed probiotic characteristics reducing cancer cell growth, could be a suitable starter culture for yogurt fermentation because of its strong acid production and high acid tolerance. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first report to describe a bacterium, isolated from kimchi, Lact. acidophilus KFRI342 which has the probiotic characteristics and the acid tolerance needed for its use as a starter culture in yogurt fermentation.
TI  - Two stomach-originated Lactobacillus strains improve Helicobacter pylori infected murine gastritis.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the potential anti-Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and anti-inflammation in vivo effects of two lactobacillus strains from human stomach. METHODS: Forty H. pylori infected Balb/c mice were randomly divided into 4 groups: proton pump inhibitor and antibiotics triple treated group, Lactobacillus fermenti (L. fermenti) treated group, Lactobacillus acidophilus treated group and normal saline control group. Ten uninfected mice were also included as blank control group. The infection of H. pylori was detected by rapid urease tests, Giemsa staining and bacterial culture. The colonization of H. pylori was assessed in bacterial density score and gastric inflammation was assessed in histological score. The colonization of L. fermenti was performed by fluorescent probe. RESULTS: Histopathologic evaluation showed significant release of mucosal inflammation in gastric antrum and gastric body in lactobacillus treated groups and triple treated group. H. pylori eradication rate in both lactobacillus treated groups and triple treated group were higher than normal saline control group. Lactobacillus treated groups and triple treated group showed significant decrease of H. pylori bacterial density. CONCLUSION: Both lactobacillus strains have a significant anti-H. pylori activity; L. fermenti displays more efficient antagonistic activity in vivo against H. pylori infection.
TI  - The effects of probiotic and conventional yoghurt on lipid profile in women.
AB  - Many studies have been done on the hypocholesterolaemic effect of probiotic yoghurt. The results, however, are not conclusive. The aim of the present study was to test the effect of probiotic and conventional yoghurt on the lipid profile in women. In a randomised trial, ninety female volunteers aged 19-49 years were assigned to three groups. Subjects consumed daily 300 g probiotic yoghurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 or 300 g conventional yoghurt or no yoghurt for 6 weeks. Fasting blood samples, 3 d dietary records and anthropometric measurements were collected at baseline (T1), end of week 3 (T2) and end of week 6 (T3). Lipid profile parameters were determined by enzymic methods. Results showed no significant difference in lipid profile within any group throughout the study. Comparing mean differences (T1 - T3) among the three groups showed: no difference in TAG and LDL-cholesterol, a decrease in cholesterol in both conventional (P < 0.05) and probiotic yoghurt groups (P < 0.005) compared with the control group, a decrease in total:HDL-cholesterol ratio for conventional (P < 0.05) and probiotic yoghurt groups (P < 0.001) compared with the control group, and an increase in HDL-cholesterol in the probiotic yoghurt group (P < 0.05) compared with the control group. Positive changes in lipid profile were observed in both yoghurt groups. Any added effect, therefore, is due to the consumption of fermented milk products.
TI  - Probiotics: multifarious oral vaccine against infectious traumas.
AB  - Microorganisms have been used for a long time in food and alcoholic fermentation. In the last few years they have undergone scientific scrutiny of their preventative and therapeutic aspects. This has led to the discovery of a new term, probiotics. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are microbial communities normally present in the intestine of most animals. They play an important role in humans and other animals, and act as immunomodulators. They are helpful in the treatment and prevention of disease as well as improving the digestion and absorption of nutrients. Probiotic microorganisms include the LAB Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. Use of these live bacteria to elicit an immune response or to carry a vaccine component is a new invention in vaccine development. The advantage of live bacterial vaccines is that they mimic natural infection, have intrinsic adjuvant properties and can be given orally. Components of pathogenic and nonpathogenic food-related microorganisms are currently being evaluated as candidates for oral vaccines.
TI  - High-level expression of Lactobacillus beta-galactosidases in Lactococcus lactis  using the food-grade, nisin-controlled expression system NICE.
AB  - In this work the overlapping genes (lacL and lacM) encoding heterodimeric beta-galactosidases from Lactobacillus reuteri , Lb. acidophilus , Lb. sakei , and Lb. plantarum were cloned into two different nisin-controlled expression (NICE) vectors and expressed using Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 and NZ3900 as hosts. The lacL gene, encoding the large subunit of the beta-galactosidases, was fused translationally downstream of the nisin-inducible promoter nisA. Chloramphenicol was employed as selection marker for the standard system using L. lactis NZ9000, whereas lactose utilization based on the complementation of the lacF gene was used as a dominant selection marker for the food-grade system employing L. lactis NZ3900. Comparison of the standard and the food-grade expression system, differing only in their selection markers, gave considerable differences in volumetric beta-galactosidase activity, ranging from 1.17 to 14 kU/L of fermentation broth, depending on both the origin of the lacLM genes and the selection marker used. The occurrence of codons less frequently used by L. lactis especially at the beginning of the lacL gene could be an explanation for the significant differences between the expression levels of lacLM from different origins, while plasmid stability might cause the difference obtained when employing the different selection markers.
TI  - Metabolites produced by probiotic Lactobacilli rapidly increase glucose uptake by Caco-2 cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although probiotic bacteria and their metabolites alter enterocyte gene expression, rapid, non-genomic responses have not been examined. The present study measured accumulation of tracer (2 microM) glucose by Caco-2 cells after exposure for 10 min or less to a chemically defined medium (CDM) with different monosaccharides before and after anaerobic culture of probiotic Lactobacilli. RESULTS: Growth of L. acidophilus was supported by CDM with 110 mM glucose, fructose, and mannose, but not with arabinose, ribose, and xylose or the sugar-free CDM. Glucose accumulation was reduced when Caco-2 cells were exposed for 10 min to sterile CDM with glucose (by 92%), mannose (by 90%), fructose (by 55%), and ribose (by 16%), but not with arabinose and xylose. Exposure of Caco-2 cells for 10 min to bacteria-free supernatants prepared after exponential (48 h) and stationary (72 h) growth phases of L. acidophilus cultured in CDM with 110 mM fructose increased glucose accumulation by 83% and 45%, respectively; exposure to a suspension of the bacteria had no effect. The increase in glucose accumulation was diminished by heat-denaturing the supernatant, indicating the response of Caco-2 cells is triggered by as yet unknown heat labile bacterial metabolites, not by a reduction in CDM components that decrease glucose uptake. Supernatants prepared after anaerobic culture of L. gasseri, L. amylovorus, L. gallinarum, and L. johnsonii in the CDM with fructose increased glucose accumulation by 83%, 32%, 27%, and 14%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The rapid, non-genomic upregulation of SGLT1 by bacterial metabolites is a heretofore unrecognized interaction between probiotics and the intestinal epithelium.
TI  - Antibacterial surface properties of fluoride-containing resin-based sealants.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to determine the antibacterial properties of three resin-based pit and fissure sealant products: Clinpro (3M ESPE), Embrace (Pulpdent), and UltraSeal XT plus (Ultradent). METHODS: The antibacterial effects of the sealants were tested in both an agar diffusion assay and a planktonic growth inhibition assay using Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus. The materials were applied to paper and enamel disks in the former and on the side walls of 96-well microtiter plates on the latter. RESULTS: All materials showed either diffusible or contact antibacterial effects in the agar diffusion assays. The effect was diminished when enamel disks were used as substrate. In the planktonic growth inhibition assay, Clinpro had its effect reduced, but retained activity against both bacteria over time. L. acidophilus was more sensitive than S. mutans to UltraSeal. Embrace retained antibacterial activity against both bacteria over time. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this in vitro study it can be concluded that all materials are capable of contact inhibition of L. acidophilus and S. mutans growth. Embrace has the longer lasting antibacterial activity when in solution, especially against S. mutans.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus induces a slow but more sustained chemokine and cytokine response in naive foetal enterocytes compared to commensal Escherichia coli.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The first exposure to microorganisms at mucosal surfaces is critical  for immune maturation and gut health. Facultative anaerobic bacteria are the first to colonise the infant gut, and the impact of these bacteria on intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) may be determinant for how the immune system subsequently tolerates gut bacteria. RESULTS: To mirror the influence of the very first bacterial stimuli on infant IEC, we isolated IEC from mouse foetuses at gestational day 19 and from germfree neonates. IEC were stimulated with gut-derived bacteria, Gram-negative Escherichia coli Nissle and Gram-positive Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM, and expression of genes important for immune regulation was measured together with cytokine production. E. coli Nissle and L. acidophilus NCFM strongly induced chemokines and cytokines, but with different kinetics, and only E. coli Nissle induced down-regulation of Toll-like receptor 4 and up-regulation of Toll-like receptor 2. The sensitivity to stimulation was similar before and after birth in germ-free IEC, although Toll-like receptor 2 expression was higher before birth than immediately after. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, IEC isolated before gut colonisation occurs at birth, are highly responsive to stimulation with gut commensals, with L. acidophilus NCFM inducing a slower, but more sustained response than E. coli Nissle. E. coli may induce intestinal tolerance through very rapid up-regulation of chemokine and cytokine genes and down-regulation of Toll-like receptor 4, while regulating also responsiveness to Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory activity and bioconversion of isoflavones by probiotics in soymilk supplemented with prebiotics.
AB  - Lactobacillus sp. FTDC 2113, L. acidophilus FTDC 8033, L. acidophilus ATCC 4356,  L. casei ATCC 393, Bifidobacterium FTDC 8943 and B. longum FTDC 8643 were incorporated into soymilk supplemented with fructooligosaccharides (FOS), inulin, mannitol, maltodextrin and pectin. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of prebiotics on the bioactivity of probiotic-fermented soymilk. Proteolytic activity was increased in the presence of FOS, while the supplementation of inulin and pectin increased the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory activity accompanied by lower IC(50) values. The beta-glucosidase activity was also enhanced in the presence of pectin. This led to higher bioconversion of glucosides to aglycones by probiotics, especially genistin and malonyl genistin to genistein. Results from this study indicated that the supplementation of prebiotics enhanced the in-vitro antihypertensive effect and production of bioactive aglycones in probiotic-fermented soymilk. Therefore, this soymilk could potentially be used as a dietary therapy to reduce the risks of hypertension and hormone-dependent diseases such as breast cancer, prostate cancer and osteoporosis.
TI  - Effect of biotherapeutics on cyclosporin-induced Clostridium difficile infection  in mice.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Immunosuppressive therapy may precipitate Clostridium difficile associated disease (CDAD). We evaluated the role of cyclosporin in the development of CDAD in the experimental mouse model and studied the effect of probiotic and epidermal growth factor (EGF) as biotherapeutics measures. METHODS: BALB/c mice (n = 24) were divided into four groups. Group I animals not given any inoculum served as controls. Animals in the remaining three groups (Group II, III and IV) were given cyclosporin daily from days 1-7 followed by C. difficile inoculum on day 8. Additionally, the animals received Lactobacillus acidophilus (Group III) and EGF (Group IV) for one-week post C. difficile challenge. The animals were evaluated for colonization and toxin production by C. difficile, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and histopathological changes. RESULTS: Clostridium difficile was colonized and elaborated its toxins in animals receiving cyclosporin and C. difficile. MPO activity was significantly higher (P < 0.05) and histopathological epithelial damage, cryptitis and acute inflammatory changes were seen in the cecum and colon. C. difficile count, toxins A and B titers and MPO activity were significantly lowered (P < 0.05) in animals receiving probiotic and EGF. Histopathologically, mucodepletion and inflammatory infiltrate were decreased in the biotherapeutic receiving animals. CONCLUSIONS: Cyclosporin led to the development of mild to moderate CDAD in animals. Administration of biotherapeutics reduced the severity of CDAD. Future clinical trials are needed for further investigation of these potential biotherapeutic measures.
TI  - Immunostimulatory activity of potential probiotic yeast strains in the dorsal air pouch system and the gut mucosa.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the immunostimulatory activity of 15 presumptive probiotic yeast strains in the dorsal air pouch system in comparison with their activity in the gut mucosa. METHODS AND RESULTS: Presumptive probiotic yeast strains previously isolated from human gastrointestinal tract and Feta cheese were further characterized genotypically and biochemically. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae 982, Saccharomyces boulardii KK1 and Kluyveromyces lactis 630 strains exhibited in the air pouch increased polymorphonuclear cell influx and phagocytic activity as well as cytokine production with similar potency as the probiotics Ultra levure S. boulardii and Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFB 1748. Oral administration of these strains in mice results in differential activation of small intestine immune responses concerning IgA and cytokine production as well as Toll-like receptor expression. CONCLUSION: Besides the Saccharomyces strains 982 and KK1, the K. lactis 630 strain could also be considered as a candidate probiotic. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The air pouch model may be used as an alternative and rapid method for the discrimination and selection of potential probiotic yeast strains.
TI  - Viability of Lactobacillus acidophilus in synbiotic guava mousses and its survival under in vitro simulated gastrointestinal conditions.
AB  - The effects of refrigeration, freezing and substitution of milk fat by inulin and whey protein concentrate (WPC) on Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 viability and resistance to gastric and enteric simulated conditions in synbiotic guava mousses effects were investigated. Refrigerated mousses supplemented with WPC presented the best probiotic viability, ranging from 7.77 to 6.24 log cfu/g during 28 days of storage. The highest probiotic populations, above 7.45 log cfu/g, were observed for all frozen mousses during 112 days of storage. Decreased L. acidophilus survival during the in vitro gastrointestinal simulation was observed both for refrigerated and frozen mousses. Nonetheless, for the refrigerated mousses, the addition of inulin enhanced the probiotic survival during the in vitro assays in the first week of storage. L. acidophilus survival in simulated gastrointestinal fluids was also improved through freezing. The frozen storage may be used to provide increased shelf-life for synbiotic guava mousses. Even though the protective effect of inulin and WPC on the probiotic microorganism tested was shown to be more specific for the refrigerated products, the partial replacement of milk fat by these ingredients may also help, as it improves the nutritional value of mousses in both storage conditions.
TI  - Purification, characterisation and identification of acidocin LCHV, an antimicrobial peptide produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus n.v. Er 317/402 strain Narine.
AB  - In the last two decades, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been gaining attention as antimicrobial alternatives to chemical food preservatives and commonly used antibiotics. Lactobacillus acidophilus n.v. Er 317/402 strain Narine produces a small AMP with a molecular weight of 1.1kDa, designated acidocin LCHV. In this study, the AMP was extremely heat stable (90min at 130 degrees C), was active over a wide pH range and was found to be sensitive to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, pepsin and proteinase K). Acidocin LCHV has a broad spectrum of activity both against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, including several that are classified as Especially Dangerous Infections by the World Health Organization as well as meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Clostridium difficile. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) was used to determine the molecular mass and sequence of the purified peptide. Complete killing with immediate impact on cells was observed within a very short period of time (10min).
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus stimulates the expression of SLC26A3 via a transcriptional mechanism.
AB  - Clinical efficacy of probiotics in treating various forms of diarrhea has been clearly established. However, mechanisms underlying antidiarrheal effects of probiotics are not completely defined. Diarrhea is caused either by decreased absorption or increased secretion of electrolytes and solutes in the intestine. In this regard, the electroneutral absorption of two major electrolytes, Na(+) and Cl(-), occurs mainly through the coupled operation of Na(+)/H(+) exchangers and Cl(-)/OH(-) exchangers. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) acutely stimulated Cl(-)/OH(-) exchange activity via an increase in the surface levels of the apical anion exchanger SLC26A3 (DRA). However, whether probiotics influence SLC26A3 expression and promoter activity has not been examined. The present studies were, therefore, undertaken to investigate the long-term effects of LA on SLC26A3 expression and promoter activity. Treatment of Caco-2 cells with LA for 6-24 h resulted in a significant increase in Cl(-)/OH(-) exchange activity. DRA mRNA levels were also significantly elevated in response to LA treatment starting as early as 8 h. Additionally, the promoter activity of DRA was increased by more than twofold following 8 h LA treatment of Caco-2 cells. Similar to the in vitro studies, in vivo studies using mice gavaged with LA also showed significantly increased DRA mRNA ( approximately 4-fold) and protein expression in the colonic regions as assessed by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence. In conclusion, increase in DRA promoter activity and expression may contribute to the upregulation of intestinal electrolyte absorption and might underlie the potential antidiarrheal effects of LA.
TI  - Vaginal lactobacilli as potential probiotics against Candida SPP.
AB  - Urogenital infections affect millions of people every year worldwide. The treatment of these diseases usually requires the use of antimicrobial agents, and more recently, the use of probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) cultures for the management of vaginal infections has been extensively studied. In this work, 11 vaginal lactobacilli isolates, previously obtained from healthy patients, were studied to screen microorganisms with probiotic properties against Candida spp. The LAB were tested for their ability of auto-aggregation, co-aggregation with C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, and C. tropicalis, adhesion to Caco-2 epithelial cells and production of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). All lactobacilli isolates tested were able to auto-aggregate (ranging from 25.3% to 75.4% assessed at 4 hours of incubation) and to co-aggregate with the four Candida species into different degrees; among them L. crispatus showed the highest scores of co-aggregation. The highest amount of lactic acid was produced by L. salivarius (13.9 g/l), followed by L. johnsonii (6.5 g/l), L. acidophilus (5.5 g/l), and L. jensenii (5.4 g/l). All isolates produced H2O2, but the highest levels (3 - 10 mg/l) were observed for L. acidophilus, L. crispatus, L. gasseri, L. johnsonii, and L. vaginalis. Only L. agilis, L. jensenii, L. johnsonii and L. ruminus were able to adhere to epithelial Caco-2 cells. Among the isolates evaluated, L agilis, L. jensenii, L. johnsonii, and L. ruminus exhibited simultaneously several desirable properties as potential probiotic strains justifying future studies to evaluate their technological properties in different pharmaceutical preparations for human use.
TI  - Candidiasis (vulvovaginal).
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vulvovaginal candidiasis is estimated to be the second most common  cause of vaginitis after bacterial vaginosis. Candida albicans accounts for 85% to 90% of cases. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of drug treatments for acute vulvovaginal candidiasis in non-pregnant symptomatic women? What are the effects of alternative or complementary treatments for acute vulvovaginal candidiasis in non-pregnant symptomatic women? What are the effects of treating a male sexual partner to resolve symptoms and prevent recurrence in non-pregnant women with symptomatic acute vulvovaginal candidiasis? What are the effects of alternative or complementary treatments for symptomatic recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis in non-pregnant women? What are the effects of treating a male sexual partner in non-pregnant women with symptomatic recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis? What are the effects of treating asymptomatic non-pregnant women with a positive swab for candidiasis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to March 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 61 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: alternative or complementary treatments; douching; drug treatments; garlic; intravaginal preparations (boric acid, nystatin, imidazoles, tea tree oil); oral fluconazole; oral itraconazole; treating a male sexual partner; and yoghurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus (oral or vaginal).
TI  - Antibacterial activity of triclosan incorporated glass ionomer cements--an in vitro pilot study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cement impregnated with different concentrations (0.5%, 1.25% and 2.5%) of a non releasing bactericide--Triclosan (TC) against two common cariogenic bacteria - Lactobacillus acidophilus and Streptococcus mutans; and to compare Triclosan incorporated GIC with chlorhexidine (CHX) incorporated GIC (2.5%) in terms of Antibacterial activity. METHODS: Chlorhexidine or Triclosan were added to glass ionomer cement powder to achieve 2.5% CHX--GIC (positive control--Group II), 0.5%, 1.25% and 2.5% TC-GIC (experimental groups III, IV and V respectively) formulations. Restorative glass ionomer cement (Fuji IX GC--Group I) served as negative control. The powder and liquid were mixed and inserted into the wells punched in agar plates (10 mm x 4 mm). The agar diffusion method was used to determine the antibacterial activity of the cements after 1, 7 and 30 days. Mean values were compared between different study groups using One-way ANOVA and Tukey's HSD procedure at a significance level of 5%. RESULTS: Triclosan incorporated GIC was more effective against L. acidophilus and S. mutans than Chlorhexidine incorporated GIC. Triclosan at a concentration of 2.5% was more effective than at lower concentrations. At all time periods studied, the maximum zone of inhibition against L. acidophilus was produced by Group V. Against S. mutans, on days 1, 7 and 30, there was no significant difference between Groups II and IV (p > 0.05), while the other groups showed significant differences. CONCLUSION: The use of triclosan as an antibacterial additive in GIC holds promise and further clinical research is needed in this direction.
TI  - Evaluation of Lactobacillus sobrius/L. amylovorus as a new microbial marker of pig manure.
AB  - Based on a comparison of the dominant microbial populations in 17 pig manure samples and using a molecular typing method, we identified a species, Lactobacillus sobrius and Lactobacillus amylovorus (which now are considered a single species and are designated L. sobrius/amylovorus here), that was consistently found in manure. The aim of the present study was to confirm by real-time PCR the relevance of this species as a marker of pig fecal contamination. The specificity of L. sobrius/amylovorus was evaluated in human and animal DNA extracted from feces. The real-time PCR assay then was applied to water samples, including effluents from urban wastewater treatment plants, runoff water, and rivers. L. sobrius/amylovorus was consistently present in all samples of swine origin: 48 fecal samples, 18 from raw manure and 10 from biologically treated manure at mean concentrations of 7.2, 5.9, and 5.0 log(10) cells/g, respectively. The species was not detected in any of the other livestock feces (38 samples from cattle and 16 from sheep), in the 27 human fecal samples, or in the 13 effluent samples from urban wastewater treatment plants. Finally, L. sobrius/amylovorus was not detected in runoff water contaminated by cattle slurry, but it was quantified at concentrations ranging from 3.7 to 6.5 log(10) cells/100 ml in runoff water collected after pig manure was spread on soil. Among the stream water samples in which cultured Escherichia coli was detected, 23% tested positive for L. sobrius/amylovorus. The results of this study indicate that the quantification of L. sobrius/amylovorus using real-time PCR will be useful for identifying pig fecal contamination in surface waters.
TI  - A standard quantitative method to measure acid tolerance of probiotic cells.
AB  - The aim of this work was to develop a standard quantitative method to measure the acid tolerance of probiotic cells when exposed to a simulated gastric fluid. Three model strains of different cell concentrations were exposed to a standard simulated gastric fluid of fixed volume. The fluid pH ranged from pH 1.5 to 2.5. In general, the death kinetics followed an exponential trend. The overall death constant, k (d), for all strains was found to be in a power relationship with the pH value and the initial cell concentration, and it can be expressed as k(d)=k(AII) (pH(-9.0)N(0)(-0.19)) where k (AII) is defined as the acid intolerance indicator and N (0) is the initial cell concentration (CFU/ml). This equation was validated with the experimental data with an average R (2) of 0.98. The acid intolerance of cells can be quantitatively expressed by the k (AII) values, where higher value indicates higher intolerance. In conclusion, a standard quantitative method has been developed to measure the acid tolerance of probiotic cells. This could facilitate the selection of probiotic strains and processing technologies.
TI  - [Expression profile analysis of intestinal Caco-2 cells treated with Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM is a probiotic strain that promotes human health. We evaluated the influence of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM on the genetic expression patterns in the Caco-2 cells. METHODS: Caco-2 cells were treated with Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM for 2h. The total RNA of cells was extracted. Hybridization with Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array was performed. The image scanning and data analysis were performed subsequently. Genes with significant expression changes were selected and analyzed. To support the microarray data, three striking difference genes were studied using Real-time RT PCR. RESULTS: Microarrays analysis showed that the expression levels of 508 genes were altered as compared with the control 473 of them were up-regulated, and 35 were down-regulated. It was supposed that many genes in Caco-2 cell were induced, so that Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM could play a part in immune system process, antioxidant activity, biological adhesion, cholesterol absorption and so on. Three striking difference genes CCL2, PTX3 and TNFRSF9 which involved immune system process were validated by Real-time RT PCR. And the results of Real-time RT PCR showed the same expression trend as in microarray. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of gene expression alterations, the beneficial function of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM could be more greatly and deeply understood than ever before, and the mechanism of lactic acid bacteria would be revealed.
TI  - Validation of the dorsal air pouch model to predict and examine immunostimulatory responses in the gut.
AB  - AIMS: To validate the use of the air pouch system to predict and examine early immune responses induced by the presumptive probiotics Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei B112, DC205, DC215 and DC412 strains in the gut mucosa. METHODS AND RESULTS: Only the DC412 strain interacted strongly with the cells forming the air pouch lining tissue and induced early innate immune responses such as polymorphonuclear (PMN) cell recruitment, phagocytosis and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) production that equal the respective responses induced by the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFB 1748. The strains exhibiting strong immunoregulatory activity in the air pouch also interacted strongly with the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). The strain DC412 exerts its effect on the intestine through stimulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR)2/TLR4-mediated signalling events leading to secretion of a certain profile of cytokines in which gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), TNF-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 are included. The probiotic Lact. acidophilus NCFB 1748 induces the same cytokine profile in addition to IL-12B, and this response is potentially mediated by the synergy of TLR2 and TLR9. CONCLUSION: The strain DC412 possesses the in vitro and in vivo characteristics of a probiotic micro-organism. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The dorsal mouse or rat air pouch may be used as an alternative and rapid method for the initial discrimination and selection of potential probiotic Lactobacillus strains.
TI  - Combined effects of probiotic fermentation and high-pressure extraction on the antioxidant, antimicrobial, and antimutagenic activities of deodeok (Codonopsis lanceolata).
AB  - This study was designed to evaluate the combined effects of probiotic fermentation and high-pressure extraction (HPE) on the functional properties of Codonopsis lanceolata. The ground C. lanceolata samples were anaerobically fermented with Lactobacillus acidophilus ADH, Bifidobacterium longum B6, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, or Lactobacillus paracasei at 37 degrees C for 10 days and subjected to 500 MPa at 50 degrees C for 30 min. The extraction yields of C. lanceolata samples were noticeably increased to 29-32% by HPE. The B. longum-fermented C. lanceolata samples extracted by high pressure (BLF-HPE) exhibited the highest antimicrobial activity (MIC < 14 mg/mL) against Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella boydii, and Salmonella typhimurium. The nonfermented C. lanceolata samples extracted with high pressure (NF-HPE) had the highest total phenolic content (13.3 mg of GAE/g). The lowest effective concentrations (EC(50) and EC(0.5)) were 4.55 and 1.76 mg/mL, respectively, for NF-HPE extracts, indicating its highest antioxidant activity. The BLF-HPE and L. rhamnosus-fermented C. lanceolata samples extracted by high pressure (LRF-HPE) exhibited the highest antimutagenic activities in S. typhimurium TA 100, which were 82 and 83% inhibition, respectively. The use of probiotic fermentation and HPE can produce more biologically active compounds in C. lanceolata than the conventional solvent extraction method. The results provide pharmaceutically useful information for improving biological properties and an approach to drug discovery.
TI  - Multistep mechanism of probiotic bacterium, the effect on innate immune system.
AB  - The etiology and pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease are still not fully understood. However, evidence from both animal models and clinical observations suggests luminal bacteria as the most probable inducer of this disease. The intestinal bacterial microbiota may be modified by dietary addition of viable probiotic bacteria, thereby constituting an alternative approach to disease prevention and treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the effects of two probiotic regiments; Lactobacillus GG and a mixture of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium lactis (YO-MIX Y 109 FRO 1000) in both normal and trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid colitis-induced rats. Colon morphology and damage were evaluated histologically; colonic tissues were used for mRNA analysis, using real-time PCR. Administration of both probiotics reduced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and IL-6 and increased the expression of mucin 2 in compared with colitis group and reduced the inflammatory response. These results provide additional support for the positive effect of probiotics in the gut and may shed light on the mechanism by which probiotic bacteria exert their action in an animal model.
TI  - Use of colony-based bacterial strain typing for tracking the fate of Lactobacillus strains during human consumption.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) are important components of the healthy gut flora and have been used extensively as probiotics. Understanding the cultivable diversity of LAB before and after probiotic administration, and being able to track the fate of administered probiotic isolates during feeding are important parameters to consider in the design of clinical trials to assess probiotic efficacy. Several methods may be used to identify bacteria at the strain level, however, PCR-based methods such as Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) are particularly suited to rapid analysis. We examined the cultivable diversity of LAB in the human gut before and after feeding with two Lactobacillus strains, and also tracked the fate of these two administered strains using a RAPD technique. RESULTS: A RAPD typing scheme was developed to genetically type LAB isolates from a wide range of species, and optimised for direct application to bacterial colony growth. A high-throughput strategy for fingerprinting the cultivable diversity of human faeces was developed and used to determine: (i) the initial cultivable LAB strain diversity in the human gut, and (ii) the fate of two Lactobacillus strains (Lactobacillus salivarius NCIMB 30211 and Lactobacillus acidophilus NCIMB 30156) contained within a capsule that was administered in a small-scale human feeding study. The L. salivarius strain was not cultivated from the faeces of any of the 12 volunteers prior to capsule administration, but appeared post-feeding in four. Strains matching the L. acidophilus NCIMB 30156 feeding strain were found in the faeces of three volunteers prior to consumption; after taking the Lactobacillus capsule, 10 of the 12 volunteers were culture positive for this strain. The appearance of both Lactobacillus strains during capsule consumption was statistically significant (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: We have shown that genetic strain typing of the cultivable human gut microbiota can be evaluated using a high throughput RAPD technique based on single bacterial colonies. Validation of this strategy paves the way for future systematic studies on the fate and efficacy of bacterial probiotics during human clinical trials.
TI  - Viability and growth characteristics of Lactobacillus in soymilk supplemented with B-vitamins.
AB  - Ten strains of Lactobacillus were evaluated for their viability in soymilk. Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 314, L. acidophilus FTDC 8833, L. acidophilus FTDC 8633 and L. gasseri FTDC 8131 displayed higher viability in soymilk and were thus selected to be evaluated for viability and growth characteristics in soymilk supplemented with B-vitamins. Pour plate analyses showed that the supplementation of all B-vitamins studied promoted the growth of lactobacilli to a viable count exceeding 7 log CFU/ml. alpha-Galactosidase specific activity of lactobacilli as determined spectrophotometrically showed an increase upon supplementation of B-vitamins. High-performance liquid chromatography analyses revealed that this led to increased hydrolysis of soy oligosaccharides and subsequently higher utilization of simple sugars. Production of organic acids as determined via high-performance liquid chromatography also showed an increase, accompanied by a decrease in pH of soymilk. Additionally, the supplementation of B-vitamins also promoted the synthesis of riboflavin and folic acid by lactobacilli in soymilk. Our results indicated that B-vitamin-supplemented soymilk is a good proliferation medium for strains of lactobacilli.
TI  - Functional and probiotic attributes of an indigenous isolate of Lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotic microorganisms favorably alter the intestinal microflora balance, promote intestinal integrity and mobility, inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria and increase resistance to infection. Probiotics are increasingly used in nutraceuticals, functional foods or in microbial interference treatment. However, the effectiveness of probiotic organism is considered to be population-specific due to variation in gut microflora, food habits and specific host-microbial interactions. Most of the probiotic strains available in the market are of western or European origin, and a strong need for exploring new indigenous probiotic organisms is felt. METHODS AND FINDINGS: An indigenous isolate Lp9 identified as Lactobacillus plantarum by molecular-typing methods was studied extensively for its functional and probiotic attributes, viz., acid and bile salt tolerance, cell surface hydrophobicity, autoaggregation and Caco-2 cell-binding as well as antibacterial and antioxidative activities. Lp9 isolate could survive 2 h incubation at pH 1.5-2.0 and toxicity of 1.5-2.0% oxgall bile. Lp9 could deconjugate major bile salts like glycocholate and deoxytaurocholate, indicating its potential to cause hypocholesterolemia. The isolate exhibited cell-surface hydrophobicity of approximately 37% and autoaggregation of approximately 31%. Presence of putative probiotic marker genes like mucus-binding protein (mub), fibronectin-binding protein (fbp) and bile salt hydrolase (bsh) were confirmed by PCR. Presence of these genes suggested the possibility of specific interaction and colonization potential of Lp9 isolate in the gut, which was also suggested by a good adhesion ratio of 7.4+/-1.3% with Caco-2 cell line. The isolate demonstrated higher free radical scavenging activity than standard probiotics L. johnsonii LA1 and L. acidophilus LA7. Lp9 also exhibited antibacterial activity against E. coli, L. monocytogenes, S. typhi, S. aureus and B. cereus. CONCLUSION: The indigenous Lactobacillus plantarum Lp9 exhibited high resistance against low pH and bile and possessed antibacterial, antioxidative and cholesterol lowering properties with a potential for exploitation in the development of indigenous functional food or nutraceuticals.
TI  - Fates of acid-resistant and non-acid-resistant Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia  coli strains in ruminant digestive contents in the absence and presence of probiotics.
AB  - Healthy ruminants are the main reservoir of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC). During their transit through the ruminant gastrointestinal tract, STEC encounters a number of acidic environments. As all STEC strains are not equally resistant to acidic conditions, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether acid resistance confers an ecological advantage to STEC strains in ruminant digestive contents and whether acid resistance mechanisms are induced in the rumen compartment. We found that acid-resistant STEC survived at higher rates during prolonged incubation in rumen fluid than acid-sensitive STEC and that they resisted the highly acidic conditions of the abomasum fluid, whereas acid-sensitive strains were killed. However, transit through the rumen contents allowed acid-sensitive strains to survive in the abomasum fluid at levels similar to those of acid-resistant STEC. The acid resistance status of the strains had little influence on STEC growth in jejunal and cecal contents. Supplementation with the probiotic Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-1077 or Lactobacillus acidophilus BT-1386 led to killing of all of the strains tested during prolonged incubation in the rumen contents, but it did not have any influence in the other digestive compartments. In addition, S. cerevisiae did not limit the induction of acid resistance in the rumen fluid. Our results indicate that the rumen compartment could be a relevant target for intervention strategies that could both limit STEC survival and eliminate induction of acid resistance mechanisms in order to decrease the number of viable STEC cells reaching the hindgut and thus STEC shedding and food contamination.
TI  - Synergistic effects of the Lactobacillus acidophilus surface layer and nisin on bacterial growth.
AB  - We have previously described a murein hydrolase activity for the surface layer (S-layer) of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356. Here we show that, in combination with nisin, this S-layer acts synergistically to inhibit the growth of pathogenic Gram-negative Salmonella enterica and potential pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. In addition, bacteriolytic effects were observed for the Gram-positive species tested. We postulate that the S-layer enhances the access of nisin into the cell membrane by enabling it to cross the cell wall, while nisin provides the sudden ion-nonspecific dissipation of the proton motive force required to enhance the S-layer murein hydrolase activity.
TI  - [Immunomodulation characteristics of Lactobacillus genus bacteria].
AB  - Immunomodulation properties of the composition which contains live cells of bacteria of genus Lactobacillus: L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus LB86 VKPM B-5788, L. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii DSM20074, L. rhmanosus LB3 IMB B-7038, L. acidophilus, L. rhamnosus VR were studied. Stimulation of phagocytic system under the influence of lactobacteria composition correlated with an increase of cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells and with their influence on synthesis of cytokines: interferon and tumor necrosis factor was shown.
TI  - The maltodextrin transport system and metabolism in Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and production of novel alpha-glucosides through reverse phosphorolysis by maltose phosphorylase.
AB  - A gene cluster involved in maltodextrin transport and metabolism was identified in the genome of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM, which encoded a maltodextrin-binding protein, three maltodextrin ATP-binding cassette transporters and five glycosidases, all under the control of a transcriptional regulator of the LacI-GalR family. Enzymatic properties are described for recombinant maltose phosphorylase (MalP) of glycoside hydrolase family 65 (GH65), which is encoded by malP (GenBank: AAV43670.1) of this gene cluster and produced in Escherichia coli. MalP catalyses phosphorolysis of maltose with inversion of the anomeric configuration releasing beta-glucose 1-phosphate (beta-Glc 1-P) and glucose. The broad specificity of the aglycone binding site was demonstrated by products formed in reverse phosphorolysis using various carbohydrate acceptor substrates and beta-Glc 1-P as the donor. MalP showed strong preference for monosaccharide acceptors with equatorial 3-OH and 4-OH, such as glucose and mannose, and also reacted with 2-deoxy glucosamine and 2-deoxy N-acetyl glucosamine. By contrast, none of the tested di- and trisaccharides served as acceptors. Disaccharide yields obtained from 50 mmbeta-Glc 1-P and 50 mm glucose, glucosamine, N-acetyl glucosamine, mannose, xylose or l-fucose were 99, 80, 53, 93, 81 and 13%, respectively. Product structures were determined by NMR and ESI-MS to be alpha-Glcp-(1-->4)-Glcp (maltose), alpha-Glcp-(1-->4)-GlcNp (maltosamine), alpha-Glcp-(1-->4)-GlcNAcp (N-acetyl maltosamine), alpha-Glcp-(1-->4)-Manp, alpha-Glcp-(1-->4)-Xylp and alpha-Glcp-(1-->4)- L-Fucp, the three latter being novel compounds. Modelling using L. brevis GH65 as the template and superimposition of acarbose from a complex with Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum GH15 glucoamylase suggested that loop 3 of MalP involved in substrate recognition blocked the binding of candidate acceptors larger than monosaccharides.
TI  - Maternal-to-infant transmission of probiotics: concept validation in mice, rats,  and pigs.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postnatal introduction of probiotics results in a low incidence of colonization, whereas maternal fecal and vaginal bacteria colonize the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of vaginally delivered infants. OBJECTIVE: We tested if probiotic bacteria, fed to three pregnant animal models, would colonize the GIT of offspring delivered vaginally. METHODS: Probiotic strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis were fed to pregnant mice, rats, and sows for at least 7 days prior to vaginal delivery. Cultural approaches and genotyping were used to determine if the probiotic bacteria colonized the GIT after birth. RESULTS: The probiotic bacteria were detected in the feces and vagina of maternal mice, rats, and sows after, but not before, administration. L. acidophilus was detected at postnatal day 14 in 22, 33, and 75% of the mice, rats, and pigs, respectively, and after weaning in 35% of the mice and 1 of 5 pigs. B. lactis was present at postnatal day 14 in 30 and 80% of the mice and pigs. Bacterial assemblages in the GIT of the colonized young differed from those in which the probiotics were not detected. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotic bacteria administered to mothers during late gestation are transferred to infants born vaginally and influence the assemblages of GIT bacteria. However, colonization of the neonatal GIT and persistence past weaning does not occur in all offspring and varies among probiotics and animal models.
TI  - Screening of Quercus infectoria gall extracts as anti-bacterial agents against dental pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A number of bacteria have now become antibiotic-resistant. This increases the importance of ayurvedic drugs. We report, here, the activity of different extracts (petroleum ether, chloroform, methanol and water) of Quercus infectoria galls against dental pathogens -- Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus acidophilus (designated) and Streptococcus sanguis (isolated). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cup-plate method was used in anti-bacterial activity of the extracts at concentration of 200 mg/ml against dental pathogens. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of most effective extracts against the most susceptible bacteria were determined using a two-fold serial micro dilution method. RESULTS: Methanolic extract showed maximum anti-bacterial activity against all the bacteria. The most susceptible bacteria were S. sanguis followed by S. aureus, S. mutans, S. salivarius and L. acidophilus. The MIC values showed that methanolic extract was more effective than water extract. CONCLUSION: The plant has the potential to generate herbal metabolites. The crude extracts demonstrating anti-dental caries activity could result in the discovery of new chemical classes of antibiotics. These chemical classes of antibiotics could serve as selective agents for the maintenance of human health and provide bio-chemical tools for the study of infectious diseases.
TI  - Clinical trial: the effects of a fermented milk containing three probiotic bacteria in patients with irritable bowel syndrome - a randomized, double-blind, controlled study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effects of probiotic bacteria in IBS remain controversial. AIM: To study the effects of a probiotic product on IBS symptoms. METHODS: We randomized 74 IBS patients to receive 8 weeks of daily treatment with 400 mL milk fermented with the yoghurt bacteria and containing Lactobacillus paracasei, ssp. paracasei F19, Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 (Cultura; active) or acidified milk without these bacteria (control). The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects reporting adequate relief of their IBS symptoms at least 50% of the weeks. IBS symptom severity, psychological symptoms and quality of life were assessed. RESULTS: The proportion of responders was 38% (14/37 patients) in the active group and 27% (10/37 patients) in the control group (P = 0.3). IBS symptom severity improved significantly in both groups during the treatment period. This change was greater in the active group during the first 2 weeks, but thereafter, no significant group differences were seen. CONCLUSIONS: We could not detect a clearly positive effect of fermented milk containing three probiotic bacteria on GI symptoms in IBS patients compared with the control treatment. However, a trend towards a more favourable effect during the first weeks was seen in the active group.
TI  - Quantitative differences in intestinal Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in obese Indian children.
AB  - Gut bacteria contribute to energy conservation in man through their ability to ferment unabsorbed carbohydrate. The present study examined the composition of predominant faecal microbiota in obese and non-obese children. The participants (n 28) aged 11-14 years provided fresh faecal samples and completed a dietary survey consisting of 24 h diet recall and a FFQ of commonly used foods taken over the previous 3 months. Faecal bacteria were quantitated by real-time PCR using primers targeted at 16S rDNA. Of the participants, fifteen (seven female) were obese, with median BMI-for-age at the 99th percentile (range 97 to>99) while thirteen participants (seven female) were normal weight, with median BMI-for age being at the 50th percentile (range 1-85). Consumption of energy, carbohydrates, fat and protein was not significantly different between the obese and non-obese participants. There was no significant difference between the two groups in faecal levels of Bacteroides-Prevotella, Bifidobacterium species, Lactobacillus acidophilus group or Eubacterium rectale. Levels of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were significantly higher in obese children than in non-obese participants (P = 0.0253). We concluded that the finding of increased numbers of F. prausnitzii in the faeces of obese children in south India adds to the growing information on alterations in faecal microbiota in obesity.
TI  - Functional identification of a putative beta-galactosidase gene in the special lac gene cluster of Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - The putative beta-galactosidase gene (lacZ) of Lactobacillus acidophilus has a very low degree of homology to the Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase gene (lacZ) and locates in a special lac gene cluster which contains two beta-galactosidase genes. No functional characteristic of the putative beta-galactosidase has been described so far. In this study, the lacZ gene of L. acidophilus was hetero-expressed in E. coli and the recombinant protein was purified by a three-step procedure. The product of the lacZ gene was also extracted from L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 and active staining was carried out. The enzymatic properties of the purified recombinant LacZ were assayed. The results of hetero-expression showed the recombinant LacZ without tag had beta-galactosidase activity. The purified recombinant LacZ had a specific activity of 43.2 U/mg protein. The result of active staining showed that the functional product of the lacZ gene did exist in L. acidophilus. The L. acidophilus beta-galactosidase (LacZ) had an optimal pH of 6, an optimal temperature of 37 degrees C and could hydrolyze 73% of lactose in milk in 30 h at 10 degrees C. The L. acidophilus beta-galactosidase (LacZ) was identified as cold-adapted beta-galactosidase in this study for the first time, and may be useful for lactose removal from dairy products at low temperatures.
TI  - Effect of probiotic mix (Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus) in the primary prevention of eczema: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  - Controversy exists regarding the preventive effect of probiotics on the development of eczema or atopic dermatitis. We investigated whether supplementation of probiotics prevents the development of eczema in infants at high risk. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 112 pregnant women with a family history of allergic diseases received a once-daily supplement, either a mixture of Bifidobacterium bifidum BGN4, B. lactis AD011, and Lactobacillus acidophilus AD031, or placebo, starting at 4-8 wks before delivery and continuing until 6 months after delivery. Infants were exclusively breast-fed during the first 3 months, and were subsequently fed with breastmilk or cow's milk formula from 4 to 6 months of age. Clinical symptoms of the infants were monitored until 1 yr of age, when the total and specific IgE against common food allergens were measured. A total of 68 infants completed the study. The prevalence of eczema at 1 yr in the probiotic group was significantly lower than in the placebo group (18.2% vs. 40.0%, p=0.048). The cumulative incidence of eczema during the first 12 months was reduced significantly in probiotic group (36.4% vs. 62.9%, p=0.029); however, there was no difference in serum total IgE level or the sensitization against food allergens between the two groups. Prenatal and postnatal supplementation with a mixture of B. bifidum BGN4, B. lactis AD011, and L. acidophilus AD031 is an effective approach in preventing the development of eczema in infants at high risk of allergy during the first year of life.
TI  - Effect of probiotic supplementation on immunoglobulins, isoagglutinins and antibody response in children of low socio-economic status.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antigen exposure is one of the major exogenous factors modulating human immunocompetence acquisition. Decline in family size and improvements in public health and hygiene in developed countries, may deprive the immune system of appropriate antigen input by diminishing infectious stimuli. Probiotics are a large group of microorganisms defined by their beneficial effects on human health and with stimulating effects on different functions of the immune system. AIM OF THE STUDY: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine if probiotics maintain their immune-stimulating effects in a population of 162 children with a high index of natural exposure to microorganisms. Children were to ingest for at least 4 months one of two products, low-fat milk fermented by Streptococcus thermophilus (control product) or low-fat milk fermented by S. thermophilus and Lactobacillus casei, with Lactobacillus acidophilus, oligofructose and inulin added after the fermentation process (test product). According to their age, children were vaccinated with DTP-Hib vaccine or a 23-valent anti-pneumococcal vaccine. RESULTS: Final analysis of results was done in 70 children in each group, showing that the rate of immunoglobulin and isoagglutinin acquisition was similar in both groups. There was no difference between groups in antibody levels neither before nor after vaccination. Days of fever and number of episodes of infection were not statistically different in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation of standard fermented milk with additional probiotics was not of benefit. The high natural rate of early microbial exposure in infants and children from a population of low socio-economic status living in a "less hygienic environment" may account for the absence of an additional immune-stimulating effect by supplementary probiotics.
TI  - Stimulatory role of grape pomace polyphenols on Lactobacillus acidophilus growth.
AB  - Grape pomace is a natural product rich in dietary fiber and polyphenols. A major  part of dietary polyphenols is not absorbed in the small intestine and can interact with colonic microbiota. The influence of grape polyphenols on Lactobacillus acidophilus CECT 903 growth was investigated through agar diffusion assays and cultures in liquid media. Grape phenolic extracts and some standards of phenolic compounds (caffeic acid, gallic acid, tannic acid, catechin, epicatechin, and quercetin) were assayed. All phenolic compounds tested did not exert an inhibitory effect on L. acidophilus growth at a maximum concentration of 5000 microg/disk in agar diffusion assays. In addition, a stimulatory trend in bacterial growth was observed in both grape phenolic extracts and tannic acid. The major finding was that grape pomace phenolic extract (1mg/mL) induced a significant biomass increase of L. acidophilus grown in liquid culture media. Further research into the interaction between phenolic compounds and other intestinal bacteria, as well as healthy consequences, is required.
TI  - Effect of fermented milk containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium longum on plasma lipids of women with normal or moderately elevated cholesterol.
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effect of milk fermented with Lactobacillus acidophilus 145 and Bifidobacterium longum BB536 on plasma lipids in a sample of adult women. A double-blind, placebo controlled, cross-over study (two periods of four weeks each separated by a 1-week washout period) was performed in 34 women, aged between 18 and 65 years. Group A consumed 125 g fermented milk three times a day for the first 4 weeks while group B consumed regular yoghurt under the same conditions. (Groups A and B switched products for the second treatment period). Women taking the test product with a baseline total cholesterol above 190 mg/dl showed a significant reduction in LDL cholesterol. HDL cholesterol was also reduced by the test product. We conclude that the fermented milk may help to reduce LDL levels in hypercholesterolemic adult women.
TI  - Evaluation of agrowastes as immobilizers for probiotics in soy milk.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate agricultural wastes as immobilizers for probiotics in liquid foods, such as soy milk. Probiotic strains were initially evaluated for acid and bile tolerance and the ability to produce alpha-galactosidase. Rinds of durian, mangosteen, and jackfruit were dried, ground, and sterilized prior to immobilization of selected strains ( Lactobacillus acidophilus FTDC 1331, L. acidophilus FTDC 2631, L. acidophilus FTDC 2333, L. acidophilus FTDC 1733, and Lactobacillus bulgaricus FTCC 0411). Immobilized cells were inoculated into soy milk, and growth properties were evaluated over 168 h at 37 degrees C. Soy milk containing free cells without agrowastes was used as the control. Immobilized probiotics showed increased growth, greater reduction of stachyose, sucrose, and glucose, higher production of lactic and acetic acids, and lower pH in soy milk compared to the control. The results illustrated that agrowastes could be used for the immobilization of probiotics with enhanced growth, utilization of substrates, and production of organic acids.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of the antimicrobial efficacy of aloe vera tooth gel and two popular commercial toothpastes: an in vitro study.
AB  - Aloe vera (Aloe barbadensis Miller) has been suggested for a wide variety of ailments but its use in dentistry is limited. This article reviews the uses of the plant and describes an in vitro investigation that compared the antimicrobial effectiveness of aloe vera tooth gel with two popular, commercially available dentifrices. The preliminary results showed that aloe vera tooth gel and the toothpastes were equally effective against Candida albicans, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. Aloe vera tooth gel demonstrated enhanced antibacterial effect against S. mitis.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria differ in their ability to induce functional regulatory T cells in humans.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Trials with probiotic lactic acid bacteria have yielded different results, which may be due to the strains used. Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are known to be potent modulators of the immune system. The capacity of these bacteria used as probiotics to influence both T helper type 1 (Th1)- and Th2-mediated diseases has been shown before. However, the ability of strains to induce forkhead box P3 (FOXP3(+)) expressing regulatory T cells has not yet been investigated. OBJECTIVE: Test the inherent differences between strains in their capacity to induce functional regulatory T cells in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). METHODS: Human PBMC were co-cultured in vitro with either Bifidobacterium lactis W51, Lactobacillus acidophilus W55 or Lactobacillus plantarum W62 or an Escherichia coli control strain. The percentage of FOXP3(+) cells, the origin of the induced cells and the functionality of these cells were assessed. Results Probiotic strains differ in their capacity to induce regulatory T cells. FOXP3(+) cells were induced from CD25(-) cells and were able to suppress effector T cells. Naturally occurring regulatory T cells were not affected by co-culture with lactobacilli. IL-10 concentrations found in the supernatant showed a trend towards the same differences between strains. Blockade of IL-10 did not influence the up-regulation of FOXP3. No differences between lactic acid bacteria were found in IL-17, IFN-gamma or IL-13. CONCLUSIONS: Some probiotic strains are potent inducers of regulatory cells, while others are not. The clear differences between strains imply that an in vitro characterization of probiotic strains before application is recommended.
TI  - The probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus reduces cholesterol absorption through the down-regulation of Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 in Caco-2 cells.
AB  - Elevated blood cholesterol is an important risk factor associated with atherosclerosis and CHD. The search for mediators that fine tune cholesterol homeostasis has recognised probiotics as being potentially beneficial. Here, we present data describing bacterial regulation of Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1), which, when weakly expressed, results in a marked reduction in intestinal absorption of cholesterol. The probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 reduced NPC1L1 gene expression and inhibited the cellular uptake of micellar cholesterol in Caco-2 cells. Soluble effector molecules secreted by ATCC 4356 were shown to be responsible for the decrease in NPC1L1. Furthermore, ATCC 4356 mediated this effect partly through the liver X receptors (LXR). The role of NPC1L1 and the LXR in cholesterol metabolism underscores the basis for the use of probiotics, such as ATCC 4356, in managing hypercholesterolaemia.
TI  - Growth-inhibiting activities of phenethyl isothiocyanate and its derivatives against intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The growth-inhibiting activities of Sinapis alba L. seed-derived materials were examined on the growth of Bifidobacterium bifidum, B. breve, B. longum, Clostridium difficile, C. perfringens, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and L. casei. The active component of S. alba seeds was purified using silica gel column chromatography and HPLC and was identified as phenethyl isothiocyanate by various spectroscopic analyses. The antimicrobial activity of phenethyl isothiocyanate varied according to the dose and bacterial strain tested. Phenethyl isothiocyanate strongly inhibited the growth of C. difficile and C. perfringens at 1 mg/disc, and weakly (+) inhibited its growth at 0.1 mg/disc. Furthermore, phenethyl isothiocyanate moderately (++) inhibited the growth of E. coli at a dose of 2 mg/disc, but did not inhibit the growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. Addition of various functional groups to isothiocyanates resulted in selective inhibitory activity against harmful bacteria with low concentrations of aromatic isothiocyanates demonstrating greater inhibitory activity against clostridia and E. coli than aliphatic isothiocyanates. In conclusion, aromatic isothiocyanates containing phenethyl-, benzyl-, and benzoyl-groups might be useful in the development of novel preventive and therapeutic agents against diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.
TI  - Complete genome sequence of Lactobacillus johnsonii FI9785, a competitive exclusion agent against pathogens in poultry.
AB  - Lactobacillus johnsonii is a member of the acidophilus group of lactobacilli. Because of their probiotic properties, including attachment to epithelial cells, immunomodulation, and competitive exclusion of pathogens, representatives of this group are being intensively studied. Here we report the complete annotated genome sequence of Lactobacillus johnsonii FI9785, a strain which prevents the colonization of specific-pathogen-free chicks by Clostridium perfringens.
TI  - Growth of Lactobacillus paracasei A13 in Argentinian probiotic cheese and its impact on the characteristics of the product.
AB  - The growth capacity of probiotic Lactobacillus paracasei A13, Bifidobacterium bifidum A1 and L. acidophilus A3 in a probiotic fresh cheese commercialized in Argentina since 1999 was studied during its manufacture and refrigerated storage at 5 degrees C and 12 degrees C for 60 days. Additionally, viable cell counts for probiotic bacteria in the commercial product are reported for batch productions over the last 9 years. L. paracasei A13 grew a half log order at 43 degrees C during the manufacturing process of probiotic cheese and another half log order during the first 15 days of storage at 5 degrees C, without negative effects on sensorial properties of the product. However, a negative impact on sensorial characteristics was observed when cheeses were stored at 12 degrees C for 60 days. Colony counts in the commercial product showed variations from batch to batch over the last 9 years. However, colony counts for each probiotic bacterium were always above the minimum suggested. Growth capacity of L. paracasei A13 in cheese during manufacturing and storage, mainly at temperatures commonly found in retail display cabinets in supermarkets (12 degrees C or more), would make it necessary to re-evaluate its role as possible probiotic starter and the consequences on food sensorial characteristics if storage temperature during commercial shelf life is not tightly controlled.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria population in children diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus.
AB  - AIM: To determine the effect of trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole treatment on the natural population of lactic acid bacteria in the intestinal tract and to determine if any of the strains developed resistance to antibiotics. METHODS: Lactic acid bacteria were isolated from stool samples of 100 children. The isolates were identified based on biochemical characteristics and DNA profiles obtained from polymerase chain reaction with genus- and species-specific primers. Resistance to sulphamethoxazole, streptomycin, compound sulphonamides, chloramphenicol and vancomycin was tested using the paper-disk method. RESULTS: The lactic acid bacteria were identified as Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus pentosus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, Enterococcus spp. and Weissella spp. Lactobacillus plantarum and Bifidobacterium spp. were not isolated. All strains, except two, were sensitive to chloramphenicol and streptomycin. Thirty-five percent of the isolates were resistant to vancomycin, 50% to compound sulphonamides and 66% to sulphamethoxazole. CONCLUSION: Treatment with trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole repressed a large number of lactic acid bacteria normally present in the intestinal tract of children. A number of strains were resistant to sulphamethoxazole and may be used as probiotics to correct the imbalance in lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - AI-2 signalling is induced by acidic shock in probiotic strains of Lactobacillus  spp.
AB  - Survival and ability to respond to various environmental stresses such as low pH  are important factors for lactobacilli for their function as probiotics. LuxS-mediated quorum sensing mechanism, which is based on the production of universal signal molecule called autoinducer-2 (AI-2), regulates important physiological traits and a variety of adaptive processes in different bacteria. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of acidic stress on LuxS-mediated quorum sensing (AI-2 signalling) in four probiotic strains of different Lactobacillus species. Initially, the production of AI-2-like molecule was investigated in four strains of Lactobacillus spp. at standard growth conditions using Vibrio harveyi bioluminescence assay. Species variation in AI-2 activity was observed. AI-2 activity started at early-exponential growth phase and increased during the mid-exponential phase concomitant with the reduction of pH, reaching maximum at late exponential phase (L. rhamnosus GG) or at stationary phase (L. salivarius UCC118, L. acidophilus NCFM and L. johnsonii NCC533). Acidic shock experiments were conducted on L. rhamnosus GG and L. acidophilus NCFM after exposure to different acidic shocks (pH 5.0, 4.0 and 3.0) and to pH 6.5 as control, measuring AI-2 activity and transcription of the luxS gene. AI-2 activity increased by lowering the pH in a dose dependent manner and was negatively influenced by acid adaptation. In both species, the luxS gene was repressed after exposure to pH 6.5 as control. However, after acidic shock (pH 4.0) a transient response of luxS gene was observed and the transcription augmented over time, reaching a maximum level and decreased subsequently. Acid adaptation of cells attenuated the transcription of this gene. Based on the observations done in the present study, the luxS gene appears to have a clear role in acidic stress response in probiotic lactobacilli. This might be important in the survival of these bacteria during the passage through the gastrointestinal tract, and further influence the cell-to-cell communication among bacteria in the intestinal microbiota.
TI  - Decolorization of water and oil-soluble azo dyes by Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus fermentum.
AB  - The capability of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus fermentum to degrade azo dyes was investigated. The bacteria were incubated under anaerobic conditions in the presence of 6 microg/ml Methyl Red, Ponceau BS, Orange G, Amaranth, Orange II, and Direct Blue 15; 5 microg/ml Sudan I and II; or 1.5 microg/ml Sudan III and IV in deMann-Rogosa-Sharpe broth at 37 degrees C for 36 h, and reduction of the dyes was monitored. Both bacteria were capable of degrading all of the water-soluble azo dyes to some extent. They were also able to completely reduce the oil-soluble diazo dyes Sudan III and IV but were unable to reduce the oil-soluble monoazo dyes Sudan I and II to any significant degree in the concentrations studied. Growth of the bacteria was not significantly affected by the presence of the Sudan azo dyes. Metabolites of the bacterial degradation of Sudan III and IV were isolated and identified by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry analyses and compared with authentic standards. Aniline and o-toluidine (2-methylaniline), both potentially carcinogenic aromatic amines, were metabolites of Sudan III and IV, respectively.
TI  - Assessment of cell surface properties and adhesion potential of selected probiotic strains.
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the physicochemical cell surface and adhesive properties of selected probiotic strains for human use. METHODS AND RESULTS: Probiotic strains, Bifidobacterium longum B6, Lactobacillus acidophilus ADH, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus casei, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Pediococcus acidilactici were tested for the physicochemical properties of cell surfaces and the adhesion abilities against foodborne pathogens. Bif. longum B6 (53.6%) and Lact. rhamnosus GG (46.5%) showed the highest hydrophobicity, while the least affinity to xylene was observed in Ped. acidilactici (10.4%). Bifidobacterium longum B6 showed the strongest coaggregation phenotype with Listeria monocytogenes (53.0%), Shigella boydii (42.0%) and Staphylococcus aureus (45.9%). Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG had the strong binding ability to Caco-2 cells and effectively inhibited the adhesion of L. monocytogenes, Salmonella Typhimurium, Sh. boydii and Staph. aureus to Caco-2 cells. The hydrophobicity was highly correlated with coaggregative abilities and competitive inhibition, suggesting a good relationship between in vitro adhesion and in vivo colonization. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that Bif. longum B6 and Lact. rhamnosus GG can be candidate probiotics available for human consumption. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Because the use of probiotic strains has been more concerned with their beneficial effects in the GI tract, it is essential to examine the potential of probiotic strains based on the physicochemical properties in terms of bacterial-binding and adhesion capabilities.
TI  - Effect of homogenization techniques on reducing the size of microcapsules and the survival of probiotic bacteria therein.
AB  - This study investigated 2 different homogenization techniques for reducing the size of calcium alginate beads during the microencapsulation process of 8 probiotic bacteria strains, namely, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, L. salivarius, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. paracasei, Bifidobacterium longum, B. lactis type Bi-04, and B. lactis type Bi-07. Two different homogenization techniques were used, namely, ultra-turrax benchtop homogenizer and Microfluidics microfluidizer. Various settings on the homogenization equipment were studied such as the number of passes, speed (rpm), duration (min), and pressure (psi). The traditional mixing method using a magnetic stirrer was used as a control. The size of microcapsules resulting from the homogenization technique, and the various settings were measured using a light microscope and a stage micrometer. The smallest capsules measuring (31.2 microm) were created with the microfluidizer using 26 passes at 1200 psi for 40 min. The greatest loss in viability of 3.21 log CFU/mL was observed when using the ultra-turrax benchtop homogenizer with a speed of 1300 rpm for 5 min. Overall, both homogenization techniques reduced capsule sizes; however, homogenization settings at high rpm also greatly reduced the viability of probiotic organisms.
TI  - [Ultrastructural change of lactobacilli during suppression of their growth by clinical strains of Candida albicans].
AB  - AIM: Detection of morphophysiological changes in cells of manufacturing strains of lactobacilli suppressed by antagonistically active clinical cultures of Candida albicans, isolated from women with torpid course of vaginosis and vaginitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three clinical strains of C. albicans suppressing growth of bacterial cells from manufacturing strains of Lactobacillus plantarum 8-PA-3, L. fermentum 90-4C and L. acidophilus D75 on modified agar-added nutrient medium were used. Using electron microscopy, ultrastructural changes in lactobacilli suppressed by C. albicans were studied. RESULTS: In places of tight contacts of interacting microorganisms, destructive changes in cell walls of lactobacilli appeared as desquamation of small layerwise fragments of peptidoglycan layers were observed. Rearrangement of ultrafine structure of lactobacilli's cytoplasm which expressed as destruction of protein-ribosomal complex was also noted. Local defects of cellular components led to total destruction of cytoplasmic contents and appearance of "cellular shadows". CONCLUSION: Surmounting by C. albicans the antagonistic action of lactobacilli with destruction of peptidoglycan layer of their cell walls could explain persistence of yeast fungi during chronic forms of vaginosis in women.
TI  - Antigen-presenting cells exposed to Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM, Bifidobacterium bifidum BI-98, and BI-504 reduce regulatory T cell activity.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect in vitro of six different probiotic strains including Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM, Lactobacillus salivarius Ls-33, Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei YS8866441, Lactobacillus plantarum Lp-115, Bifidobacterium bifidum BI-504 and BI-98 was studied on splenic enteroantigen-presenting cells (APC) and CD4(+)CD25(+) T-regulatory cells (Tregs) in splenocyte-T cell proliferation assays. METHODS: Splenocytes exposed to enteroantigen +/- probiotics were used to stimulate cultured CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells to which titrated numbers of Tregs were added. Cytokine assays were performed by use of neutralizing antibodies and ELISA. RESULTS: Exposure of APCs to enteroantigens and the series of probiotic strains mentioned above did not influence the stimulatory capacity of APCs on proliferative enteroantigen-specific T cells. However, exposure to B. bifidum BI-98, BI-504 and L. acidophilus NCFM consistently reduced the suppressive activity of Tregs. The suppressive activity was analyzed using fractionated components of the probiotics, and showed that a component of the cell wall is responsible for the decreased Treg activity in the system. The probiotic-induced suppression of Treg function is not mediated by changes in APC-secretion of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 or IL-1b. CONCLUSION: We conclude that certain probiotic strains can modify APCs to cause reduced Treg activity. This effect apparently depends on a direct APC-to-Treg cell contact. The APC-mediated suppressive effect on Treg function of certain probiotic strains may constrain the anti-inflammatory activity, which is often desired from probiotic therapy. This unexpected function of certain probiotic strains should be taken into consideration when designing adjuvant therapies with these bacteria, or when probiotic strains are selected for improvement of gut-associated inflammation like IBD.
TI  - Acaciaside-B-enriched fraction of Acacia auriculiformis is a prospective spermicide with no mutagenic property.
AB  - As a part of our continued venture to develop a safe and effective spermicide, we have identified a triterpene glycoside (Acaciaside-B (Ac-B))-enriched fraction (Ac-B-en) isolated from the seeds of Acacia auriculiformis and evaluated its spermicidal potential in vitro. Sperm motility was completely inhibited within 20 s at a minimum effective concentration (MEC) of 120 microg/ml. Tests for sperm viability by dual fluoroprobe staining showed the effect to be spermicidal with an EC(50) of 35.20 microg/ml. A series of investigations including tests for hypo-osmotic swelling, membrane lipid peroxidation, and electron microscopy document that the spermicidal effect of the fraction involves loss of sperm plasma membrane integrity and dissolution of the acrosomal vesicle--the two most important structural components that play diverse roles in physiological functions of sperm including fertilization. The fraction at 10 x MEC exerted no detrimental effects on in vitro growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus, which is considered the major constituent of vaginal microflora that maintains vaginal health. Ames tests performed with different strains of Salmonella typhimurium including TA 97a, 98, 100, and 102, which detect mutagens causing bp substitution or frameshifting at G-C or A-T bp, demonstrate no mutagenic potential of the fraction. Significant spermicidal potential with no possible mutagenic effect and adverse impacts on lactobacilli growth attests to the credential of Ac-B-en as a prospective future spermicide for the development of a safe and effective vaginal contraceptive formulation.
TI  - Impact of stress conditions on the growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus IBB 801 and production of acidophilin 801.
AB  - The influence of different stress conditions, such as low and high temperatures,  the presence of salt or ethanol in the medium, on the growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus IBB801 and the production of acidophilin 801 was investigated in this study. The strain was able to grow at up at to 47 degrees C, while higher temperatures were lethal. A slow growth was detected at 24 degrees C, starting after 24 h of incubation, and the strain was able to survive at 10 degrees C for more than 48 h of incubation. The protein profiles revealed by one dimensional SDS-PAGE showed at least four overexpressed and two repressed bands at low temperatures (10 degrees C and 24 degrees C) compared with the profiles at 37 degrees C and 42 degrees C. The bacteriocin activity was the highest when the producing strain was grown at optimum temperature. However, at 10 degrees C, the inhibitory activity showed a slight increase compared with the one reached at 24 degrees C and 47 degrees C. The same increase in activity was observed in the presence of low amounts of salt (5 to 10 g/L). Higher concentrations of salt or ethanol addition to the growth medium had a negative effect on acidophilin biosynthesis.
TI  - Probiotics in spondyloarthropathy associated with ulcerative colitis: a pilot study.
AB  
TI  - Enhancement of survival of probiotic and non-probiotic lactic acid bacteria by yeasts in fermented milk under non-refrigerated conditions.
AB  - The effects of yeasts on the survival of probiotic and non-probiotic lactic acid  bacteria (LAB) were studied in fermented milk under non-refrigerated conditions (30 degrees C) with a view to develop ambient-stable fermented milk with live LAB. Five yeasts tested (Saccharomyces bayanus, Williopsis saturnus var. saturnus, Yarrowia lipolytica, Candida kefyr and Kluyveromyces marxianus) enhanced the survival of Lactobacillus bulgaricus (but not Streptococcus thermophilus) in a mixed yoghurt culture in yoghurt by approximately 10(2) to 10(5)-fold. Seven yeasts examined (Candida krusei, Geotrichum candidum, Pichia subpelliculosa, Kloeckera apiculata, Pichia membranifaciens, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Y. lipolytica) improved the survival of Lactobacillus rhamnosus in fermented milk by approximately10(3) to 10(6)-fold. W. saturnus var. saturnus enhanced the survival of Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. rhamnosus (probiotic) and Lactobacillus reuteri by up to 10(6)-fold, but the same yeast failed to improve the survival of Lactobacillus johnsonii (probiotic), S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus in fermented milk. These results provide definitive evidence that yeasts possess stability-enhancing effects on LAB and that the specific effects of yeasts on LAB stability vary with yeasts as well as with LAB. However, the molecular mechanism of such interaction of yeasts with LAB remains to be found.
TI  - Antagonistic activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus RY2 isolated from healthy infancy feces on the growth and adhesion characteristics of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli.
AB  - Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAggEC) infection is an important cause of acute diarrhea, affecting children in developing countries and travelers visiting tropical or subtropical areas. Three probiotics can exert bacteriostatic or bactericidal effects on human and animal intestinal pathogens, the efficiency of probiotics on EAggEC infection remains unclear. In this study, the antagonistic activity of probiotic bacteria isolated from infant faeces was examined against several EAggEC stains. While three isolates, Lactobacillus acidophilus RY2, Lactobacillus salivarius MM1 and Lactobacillus paracasei En4 were shown to significantly inhibit the growth of EAggEC. In addition, the antagonistic activity of the Lactobacillus species was maintained despite heating (100 degrees C, 15 min) of cell free culture supernatant (CFCS). The antagonistic activity of the CFCS however, could be reduced following lactate dehydrogenase treatment and at pH 7.2. Furthermore, in an adhesion-inhibition assay, L. acidophilus RY2 was shown to be more effective than L. salivarius MM1 and L. paracasei EN4. This study suggests that L. acidophilus RY2 could be used as a probiotic organism against EAggEC.
TI  - Probiotic effects on cold and influenza-like symptom incidence and duration in children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Probiotic consumption effects on cold and influenza-like symptom incidence and duration were evaluated in healthy children during the winter season. METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 326 eligible children (3-5 years of age) were assigned randomly to receive placebo (N = 104), Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM (N = 110), or L acidophilus NCFM in combination with Bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis Bi-07 (N = 112). Children were treated twice daily for 6 months. RESULTS: Relative to the placebo group, single and combination probiotics reduced fever incidence by 53.0% (P = .0085) and 72.7% (P = .0009), coughing incidence by 41.4% (P = .027) and 62.1% (P = .005), and rhinorrhea incidence by 28.2% (P = .68) and 58.8% (P = .03), respectively. Fever, coughing, and rhinorrhea duration was decreased significantly, relative to placebo, by 32% (single strain; P = .0023) and 48% (strain combination; P < .001). Antibiotic use incidence was reduced, relative to placebo, by 68.4% (single strain; P = .0002) and 84.2% (strain combination; P < .0001). Subjects receiving probiotic products had significant reductions in days absent from group child care, by 31.8% (single strain; P = .002) and 27.7% (strain combination; P < .001), compared with subjects receiving placebo treatment. CONCLUSION: Daily dietary probiotic supplementation for 6 months was a safe effective way to reduce fever, rhinorrhea, and cough incidence and duration and antibiotic prescription incidence, as well as the number of missed school days attributable to illness, for children 3 to 5 years of age.
TI  - Probiotic cheddar cheese: influence of ripening temperatures on proteolysis and sensory characteristics of cheddar cheeses.
AB  - Bifidobacterium longum 1941, B. animalis subsp. lactis LAFTI B94, Lactobacillus casei 279, Lb. casei LAFTI L26, Lb. acidophilus 4962, or Lb. acidophilus LAFTI L10 were used as an adjunct in the production of Cheddar cheeses, which were ripened at 4 and 8 degrees C for 24 wk. Effects of ripening temperatures and probiotic adjuncts on proteolysis and sensory evaluation of the cheeses were examined. Higher ripening temperature increased the level of proteolysis in the cheeses. Product of proteolysis and organic acids released during ripening were shown to be important for the flavor of Cheddar cheeses. There were positive and significant correlations between the levels of soluble nitrogen, lactic, acetic, and butyric acids, percentage hydrolysis of alpha(s1)-CN and beta-CN to the scores of cheddary flavor (P < 0.05). Scores for sour-acid and vinegary flavors were higher in cheeses with the addition of Bifidobacterium sp. or Lb. casei 279 ripened at 8 degrees C. The scores were positively and significantly correlated to the level of lactic, acetic, and free amino acids in the cheeses (P < 0.05). The results show that both 4 and 8 degrees C have potential for use in the ripening of probiotic Cheddar cheeses.
TI  - Intervention of Acidophilus-casei dahi and wheat bran against molecular alteration in colon carcinogenesis.
AB  - An in vivo trial was conducted on seventy five rats allocated to three groups, first group was DMH control group, second group was Wheat bran-DMH group (WB-DMH) in which wheat bran was given along with DMH (1,2-dimethylhydrazine) injection, third group was Wheat bran-DMH-Ac Dahi group in which both wheat bran and Acidophilus-casei dahi (a probiotic microorganisms fermented dairy product) was given along with DMH injections. Animals received subcutaneous injections of DMH at a dose rate of 20 mg/kg body weight, once weekly for 15 weeks. The rats were dissected at 40th week of experiment and comet assay was done in colonic cells to assess the DNA damage. The c-myc and cox-2 expression was studied in rat tumour. A significant reduction in DNA damage (48.2%) was observed in WB-DMH-Ac Dahi group as compared to DMH control group (87.8%). The c-myc and cox-2 mRNA level was found highest in DMH control group as compared to WB-DMH and WB-DMH-Ac Dahi group. The results of present study show the enhanced protective potential of Acidophilus-casei and wheat bran against DMH induced molecular alteration in colonic cells during carcinogenesis.
TI  - Antioxidant and cholesterol assimilation activities of selected lactobacilli and  lactococci cultures.
AB  - In present study, three strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) viz. Lactobacillus  casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactococcus lactis and milk fermented with these strains have been studied for antioxidant and cholesterol assimilation activities in-vitro and in-vivo, in addition to the effect on total lactobacilli, lactococci and coliform counts into the gut of mice fed with diets supplemented by fermented milk. All three selected strains exhibited potent 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, malonaldialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide radical scavenging abilities as well as inhibition of linoleic acid peroxidation activity. These activities were highest in Lb. casei as followed by Lb. acidophilus and Lc. lactis. In addition, these bacterial cultures also exhibited good in-vitro cholesterol assimilation potential. Oral administration to mice of milk fermented with selected LAB strains, slightly decreased blood cholesterol, increased colonization of total lactobacilli and lactococci, and decreased coliforms in the intestinal tissues as well as faecal samples. These results indicate that, selected LAB strains have good antioxidant, hypocholesterolemic and coliform removal activities. It may suggest that, a novel functional food can be obtained by supplementation of selected LAB in milk, which may have various health beneficial properties such as antioxidant and hypocholesterolemic activities.
TI  - Role of transporter proteins in bile tolerance of Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM derivatives containing deletion mutations in the transporter genes LBA0552, LBA1429, LBA1446, and LBA1679 exhibited increased sensitivity to bile. These strains showed unique patterns of sensitivity to a variety of inhibitory compounds, as well as differential accumulations of ciprofloxacin and taurocholate.
TI  - Oral bacterial adhesion forces to biomaterial surfaces constituting the bracket-adhesive-enamel junction in orthodontic treatment.
AB  - Bacterial adhesion to biomaterial surfaces constituting the bracket-adhesive-enamel junction represents a growing problem in orthodontics, because bacteria can adversely affect treatment by causing demineralization of the enamel surface around the brackets. It is important to know the forces with which bacteria adhere to the surfaces of these junction materials, as the strength of these forces will determine how easy it will be to remove the bacteria. We compared the adhesion forces of five initially colonizing and four cariogenic strains of bacteria to an orthodontic adhesive, stainless steel, and enamel, with and without a salivary conditioning film. Adhesion forces were determined using atomic force microscopy and a bacterial probe. In the absence of a salivary conditioning film, the strongest bacterial adhesion forces occurred to the adhesive surface (-2.9 to -6.9 nN), while adhesion forces to the enamel surfaces were lowest (-0.8 to -2.7 nN). In the presence of a salivary conditioning film, adhesion forces were reduced strongly, to less than 1 nN, and the differences between the various materials were reduced. Generally, however, initial colonizers of dental hard surfaces presented stronger adhesion forces to the different materials (-4.7 and -0.6 nN in the absence and presence of a salivary conditioning film, respectively) than cariogenic strains (-1.8 and -0.5 nN).
TI  - Heterologous expression and secretion of Lactobacillus amylovorus alpha-amylase in Leuconostoc citreum.
AB  - To develop a gene expression system for Leuconostoc genus, construction of expression vector and expression of a heterologus protein in Leuconostoc was performed. Alpha-amylase gene from Lactobacillus amylovorus was cloned into a Leuconostoc cloning vector, pLeuCM, with its own signal peptide. pLeuCMamy was introduced into Leuconostoc citreum CB2567 and a successful expression of alpha-amy gene was confirmed by enzyme activity assays. About 90% of alpha-amylase activity was detected in the culture broth, revealing most of expressed alpha-amylase was secreted out cells. The signal sequence of alpha-amy gene is a good candidate for the secretion of heterologous protein by using Leuconostoc host-vector system.
TI  - Lactobacillus taiwanensis sp. nov., isolated from silage.
AB  - Strain FIRDI 006T, isolated from silage cattle feed, was characterized by using phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. The strain was a homofermentative lactic acid bacterium; the cells stained Gram-positive and were catalase-negative, non-motile, facultatively anaerobic rods. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that the strain belongs phylogenetically to the genus Lactobacillus and can be placed within the Lactobacillus acidophilus-delbrueckii group. Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus johnsonii were the most closely related species, with 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities of 99.53 and 99.46% to the respective type strains. Low gyrB gene sequence similarities (<90%) and low DNA-DNA reassociation values (<45%) were obtained between the strain and the phylogenetically closest neighbours. Based on phenotypic and genetic evidence, the strain is considered to represent a novel species, for which the name Lactobacillus taiwanensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is FIRDI 006T (=BCRC 17755T =DSM 21401T).
TI  - Specific probiotics alleviate allergic rhinitis during the birch pollen season.
AB  - AIM: To investigate whether birch pollen allergy symptoms are linked with gut microbiota changes and whether probiotics have an effect on these. METHODS: Forty seven children with confirmed birch pollen allergy were randomized to receive either a probiotic combination of Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) NCFM (ATCC 700396) and Bifidobacterium lactis (B. lactis) Bl-04 (ATCC SD5219) or placebo in a double-blind manner for 4 mo, starting prior to onset of the birch pollen season. Symptoms were recorded in a diary. Blood samples were taken for analysis of cytokines and eosinophils. Fecal samples were analysed for microbiota components, calprotectin and IgA. Nasal swabs were taken for analysis of eosinophils. RESULTS: The pollen season induced a reduction in Bifidobacterium, Clostridium and Bacteroides which could not be prevented by the probiotic intervention. During the intervention, significantly higher numbers of B. lactis 11.2 x 10(7) +/- 4.2 x 10(7) vs 0.1 x 10(7) +/- 0.1 x 10(7) bacteria/g feces (P < 0.0001) and L. acidophilus NCFM 3.5 x 10(6) +/- 1.3 x 10(6) vs 0.2 x 10(6) +/- 0.1 x 10(6) bacteria/g feces (P < 0.0001) were observed in the probiotic group compared to the placebo group. During May, there was a tendency for fewer subjects, (76.2% vs 95.2%, P = 0.078) to report runny nose, while during June, fewer subjects, 11.1% vs 33.3%, reported nasal blocking in the probiotics group (P = 0.101). Concomitantly, fewer subjects in the probiotic group had infiltration of eosinophils in the nasal mucosa compared to the placebo group, 57.1% vs 95% (P = 0.013). Eye symptoms tended to be slightly more frequent in the probiotic group, 12.5 d [interquartile range (IQR) 6-18] vs 7.5 d (IQR 0-11.5) (P = 0.066) during May. Fecal IgA was increased in the placebo group during the pollen season; this increase was prevented by the probiotics (P = 0.028). CONCLUSION: Birch pollen allergy was shown to be associated with changes in fecal microbiota composition. The specific combination of probiotics used was shown to prevent the pollen-induced infiltration of eosinophils into the nasal mucosa, and indicated a trend for reduced nasal symptoms.
TI  - Browning of freeze-dried probiotic bacteria cultures in relation to loss of viability during storage.
AB  - Freeze-dried cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus (La-5) showed visible brown discoloration even after a short storage at relatively mild conditions (a(w) = 0.22 and 30 degrees C), and the browning processes were found to coincide with bacteria inactivation. It was demonstrated, by using high-pressure treatment for obtaining bacteria samples with different ratios of live/dead bacteria, that death of bacteria is not a prerequisite for the browning processes. Furthermore, it was shown that hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) (or condensation products of HMF) introduces accelerated viability loss when HMF is added to the freeze-drying medium. Discoloration of bacteria cultures containing only sucrose/maltodextrin or lactose/maltodextrin in the freeze-drying matrices is suggested to be related to various types of nonenzymatic browning reactions, including carbonyl-protein (or carbonyl-DNA) interactions and carbohydrate condensation/polymerization (without involvement of proteins), the latter proceeding at low a(w) following hydrolysis of the peptidoglycan layer in the bacteria cell wall. More than one single type of browning reaction is accordingly concluded to be related to bacteria death, and the loss of viability in freeze-dried bacteria seems to be influenced by oxidation reactions, browning reactions, and the physical instability of the bacteria membrane/cell wall.
TI  - Antigenic proteins of Lactobacillus acidophilus that are recognised by serum IgG  antibodies in children with type 1 diabetes and coeliac disease.
AB  - Immune responses to lactobacilli have been so far insufficiently investigated in  patients with autoimmune diseases. We used whole-cell lysate of an indigenous Lactobacillus acidophilus strain isolated from an Estonian child to study serum IgG antibodies in children groups with type 1 diabetes [insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM)] (n = 21, age 4-18 yr) and with acute coeliac disease (CD) (n = 20, age 0.6-15 yr) and to compare the results with the controls (n = 24, age 2-17 yr). We found that our developed 1-D immunoblot assay readily enables to reveal antibodies against 28 L. acidophilus antigenic proteins in patients' and controls' sera. As verified by immunoproteomics analysis with 2-D and LC ESI-MS/MS the antigens of L. acidophilus were mainly common cytoplasmic proteins GroEL (HSP60), enolase, transcription factor EF-Ts and EF-Tu. However, in addition we identified formyl-CoA transferase being target for antibodies in every tested IDDM patients' serum. We have characterized for the first time the antigenic profile of L. acidophilus whole-cell lysate using sera from children with IDDM, CD, and controls. The different prevalence of reactions against tested antigens in patients and controls sera may indicate significant differences in immune system and commensal bacteria cross-talk in these groups.
TI  - Probiotic therapy in radiation-induced intestinal injury and repair.
AB  - Intestinal injury from ionizing radiation is a clinically important entity, as enteritis symptoms occur commonly after radiotherapy for pelvic malignancies. Preventative or therapeutic options for radiation enteritis are mostly unsatisfactory; however, available data suggests that probiotic bacteria--those which confer health benefit--may have therapeutic value. Previous reports from both human trials and animal models have evaluated various end points for probiotic usage in limiting radiation-associated intestinal damage. Newer data suggests that particular probiotics and/or their secreted or derived bacterial products may have unique radioprotective properties. We will review the area with a focus on new developments surrounding probiotic therapy in radiation-induced intestinal injury and repair.
TI  - Lactobacilli inhibit Shigella dysenteriae 1 induced pro-inflammatory response and cytotoxicity in host cells via impediment of Shigella-host interactions.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Shigella dysenteriae Type 1 dysentery is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children from less developed and developing countries. The present study explores the hypothesis that lactobacilli protect the host cell during S. dysenteriae Type 1 infection and its mechanism of action. METHODS: Caco-2 cells incubated for 1h with Lactobacillus rhamnosus or Lactobacillus acidophilus at the multiplicity of infection of 100, either alone or in combination followed by addition of Shigella at the same multiplicity of infection for 5h served as treatment groups. Cells incubated with Shigella without lactobacilli addition served as infected cells. At the end of experimental period, cells were processed suitably to enumerate adherent and internalized Shigella. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed to assess mRNA expression of interleukin-8 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha. Immunoblot for heat shock protein-70 and cytotoxicity assay were performed. RESULTS: Pretreatment with the combination of lactobacilli significantly (p<0.05) prevented adherence and internalization of Shigella coupled with reduced expression of tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-8 in host cells. CONCLUSION: L. rhamnosus and L. acidophilus, synergistically offered better protection during S. dysenteriae Type 1 infection by efficiently inhibiting adherence and internalization of Shigella coupled with inhibition of pro-inflammatory response.
TI  - Quantification of live and dead probiotic bacteria in lyophilised product by real-time PCR and by flow cytometry.
AB  - The basic requirement for probiotic bacteria to be able to exert expected positive effects is to be alive; therefore, appropriate quantification methods are crucial. Due to disadvantages of conventional microbiological methods, the bacterial quantification based on the nucleic acid detection is increasingly used. The objective of this study was to evaluate the possibility to use propidium monoazide (PMA) in combination with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method or LIVE/DEAD BacLight viability kit in combination with flow cytometry (FCM) for determination of probiotic bacteria in a lyophilised product containing Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 and Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis BB-12. In addition, the viability of probiotic bacteria in lyophilised product during 3 months storage was investigated. In the product, the results of real-time PCR quantification of PMA-treated cells did not differ significantly from those of non-treated cells, which indicate that most of the bacterial cells retained the membrane integrity although they have lost the culturability. The results obtained by FCM analysis were comparable with those by PMA real-time PCR. In conclusion, the PMA real-time PCR and FCM determination of the viability of probiotic bacteria could complement the plate count method which considers only the culturable part of the population.
TI  - Isolation and identification of antimicrobial compound from Mentha longifolia L.  leaves grown wild in Iraq.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mentha longifolia L. (Lamiaceae) leaves have been traditionally implemented in the treatment of minor sore throat and minor mouth or throat irritation by the indigenous people of Iraq, although the compounds responsible for the medicinal properties have not been identified. In the present study, an antimicrobial compound was isolated and characterized, and its biological activity was assessed. METHODS: The compound was isolated and characterized from the extracted essential oil using different spectral techniques: TLC, FTIR spectra and HPLC. Antimicrobial activity of the compound was assessed using both disc diffusion and microdilution method in 96 multi-well microtiter plates. RESULTS: A known compound was isolated from the essential oil of the plant and was identified as (-) menthol. The isolated compound was investigated for its antimicrobial activity against seven selected pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the yeast Candida albicans. Menthol at different concentrations (1:1, 1:5, 1:10, 1:20) was active against all tested bacteria except for P. aeruginosa, and the highest inhibitory effect was observed against S. mutans (zone of inhibition: 25.3 mm) using the disc diffusion method. Minimal inhibitory concentration MIC values ranged from 15.6-125.0 microg/ml, and the most promising results were observed against S. aureus and S. mutans (MIC 15.6 microg/ml) while, S. faecalis, S. pyogenis and L. acidophilus ranked next (MIC 31.2 microg/ml). Furthermore, menthol achieved considerable antifungal activity against the yeast C. albicans (zone of inhibition range: 7.1-18.5 mm; MIC: 125.0). CONCLUSION: The isolation of an antimicrobial compound from M. longifolia leaves validates the use of this plant in the treatment of minor sore throat and minor mouth or throat irritation.
TI  - Prevention of TNBS-induced colitis by different Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains is associated with an expansion of gammadeltaT and regulatory T cells of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics may protect against inflammatory bowel disease through regulation of lamina propria lymphocytes (LPLs) function. Data are lacking on possible involvement of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs). The aim of this study was to investigate whether different probiotic mixtures prevented gut inflammatory disease and the role of both IELs and LPLs. METHODS: BALB/c mice received 2 probiotic mixtures orally for 3 weeks, as Mix1 (Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium longum), or Mix2 (Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis). Colitis was induced by intrarectal administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). Probiotics in stools were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Colon subpopulations of IELs and LPLs were assayed by flow cytometry. Serum cytokines were measured by cytometric bead array (CBA). RESULTS: All probiotics colonized the intestine. The 2 mixtures prevented the TNBS-induced intestinal damage, and Mix1 was the most effective. The Mix1 protection was associated with a reduction in CD4(+) cells of IELs and LPLs, an increase in gammadeltaT cells of IELs, and a decrease in gammadeltaT cells of LPLs. An expansion of T regulatory (Treg) cells of IELs was induced by Mix1 and Mix2. Both probiotic mixtures inhibited tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 production and upregulated interleukin (IL)-10. In addition, Mix1 prevented the TNBS-induced increase of IL-12 and interferon (IFN)-gamma. CONCLUSIONS: The 2 probiotic mixtures were able to prevent the TNBS-induced colitis; the L. acidophilus and B. longum mixture was the most effective. Other than an involvement of LPLs, our results report a novel importance of the IELs population in probiotic protection.
TI  - Protective efficacy of probiotic alone or in conjunction with a prebiotic in Salmonella-induced liver damage.
AB  - In view of the increasing interest in the bioecological and nutritional control of diseases, use of probiotics alone or in combination with prebiotics (synbiotics) appears as a therapeutic option for various diseases. In this study, an attempt was made to explore the protective potential of Lactobacillus acidophilus as a probiotic, inulin as a prebiotic and both L. acidophilus and inulin as synbiotic against Salmonella-induced liver damage in a murine model. The probiotic, prebiotic and synbiotic supplementation resulted in decreased bacterial translocation in the liver of mice challenged with Salmonella typhimurium and decreased levels of serum aminotransferases, suggesting their protective role against Salmonella infection. Mice supplemented with these preparations before Salmonella challenge also revealed decreased levels of lipid peroxidation, increased levels of superoxide dismutase and glutathione, along with reduced levels of nitric oxide. Thus, bacteriological and biochemical alterations correlated well with the histological evidence. Protection afforded by supplementation with the probiotic alone was found to be more effective. None of the observations was suggestive of the synergistic effect in the synbiotic-supplemented animals. Thus, it is indicated that the probiotic and the prebiotic used in the present study may act by different mechanisms involved in affording protection against Salmonella-induced liver damage.
TI  - Lactococcus lactis expressing either Staphylococcus aureus fibronectin-binding protein A or Listeria monocytogenes internalin A can efficiently internalize and deliver DNA in human epithelial cells.
AB  - Lactococci are noninvasive bacteria frequently used as protein delivery vectors and, more recently, as in vitro and in vivo DNA delivery vehicles. We previously showed that a functional eukaryotic enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) expression plasmid vector was delivered in epithelial cells by Lactococcus lactis producing Listeria monocytogenes internalin A (L. lactis InlA(+)), but this strategy is limited in vivo to transgenic mice and guinea pigs. In this study, we compare the internalization ability of L. lactis InlA(+) and L. lactis producing either the fibronectin-binding protein A of Staphylococcus aureus (L. lactis FnBPA(+)) or its fibronectin binding domains C and D (L. lactis CD(+)). L. lactis FnBPA(+) and L. lactis InlA(+) showed comparable internalization rates in Caco-2 cells, while the internalization rate observed with L. lactis CD(+) was lower. As visualized by conventional and confocal fluorescence microscopy, large clusters of L. lactis FnBPA(+), L. lactis CD(+), and L. lactis InlA(+) were present in the cytoplasm of Caco-2 cells after internalization. Moreover, the internalization rates of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and of an NCFM mutant strain with the gene coding for the fibronectin-binding protein (fbpA) inactivated were also evaluated in Caco-2 cells. Similar low internalization rates were observed for both wild-type L. acidophilus NCFM and the fbpA mutant, suggesting that commensal fibronectin binding proteins have a role in adhesion but not in invasion. L. lactis FnBPA(+), L. lactis CD(+), and L. lactis InlA(+) were then used to deliver a eukaryotic eGFP expression plasmid in Caco-2 cells: flow cytometry analysis showed that the highest percentage of green fluorescent Caco-2 cells was observed after coculture with either L. lactis FnBPA(+) or L. lactis InlA(+). Analysis of the in vivo efficiency of these invasive recombinant strains is currently in progress to validate their potential as DNA vaccine delivery vehicles.
TI  - Coaggregation between probiotic bacteria and caries-associated strains: an in vitro study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the in vitro abilities of probiotic bacteria derived from  consumer products to coaggregate with caries-associated mutans streptococci. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Six lactobacillus strains (L. acidophilus (CCUG 5917), L. plantarum 299v, L. rhamnosus GG and LB21, L. paracasei F19, L. reuteri PTA5289) were cultivated under anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees C in Man Rogosa Sharpe (MSB) broth for 24 h. Four strains of human streptococci (S. mutans Ingbritt, S. mutans (ATCC 25175), S. mutans GS-5, S. sobrinus (ATCC 33478) were similarly grown in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth. A gastrointestinal pathogen (Escherichia coli) was aerobically cultivated on BHI broth as a positive control. After incubation, the bacteria were aerobically harvested, washed, and suspended in 10 mmol/l phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2). The probiotic strains were characterized with the API 50 CH system to confirm their identity. Coaggregation was determined by spectrophotometry in mixtures and bacterial suspensions alone after 1, 2, 4, and 24 h and expressed as the aggregation ratio (%). RESULTS: All probiotic strains showed coaggregation abilities with the oral pathogens and the results were strain specific and dependent on time. S. mutans GS-5 exhibited a significantly higher ability to coaggregate with all the probiotic strains than the other mutans streptococci and E. coli. The differences among the probiotic strains were modest with L. acidophilus being the most prone and L. rhamnosus LB21 the least prone to coaggregate with the oral streptococci. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated different abilities of lactobacilli-derived probiotic bacteria to coaggregate with selected oral streptococci. Aggregation assays may be a useful complement for screening of probiotic candidates with possible anti-caries properties.
TI  - Effect of exopolysaccharides on the hydrolysis of beta-lactoglobulin by Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 636 in an in vitro gastric/pancreatic system.
AB  - An analysis of the peptides generated by hydrolysis of BLG by nonproliferating cells of the strain Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 636 was carried out. The effect of polysaccharides (pectin, and two EPS synthesized by two Streptococcus thermophilus strains, EPS1190 and EPS804) on BLG digestibility using an in vitro gastric/pancreatic system was analyzed. Polysaccharides are commonly used in the dairy industry to improve food texture; these hydrocolloids may interact with proteins, affecting their digestibility. Nonproliferating cells of Lb. acidophilus CRL 636 were able to hydrolyze 52% of BLG. Twenty-six resulting peptides with molecular masses in the range 544-4119 Da were identified by LC-MS/MS. These peptides resulted mostly from the hydrolysis of the more accessible N-terminal part of BLG. Degradation of BLG by pepsin was poor (8%). When BLG was previously hydrolyzed by Lb. acidophilus CRL 636, peptic hydrolysis was of 54.8%, while when pectin and EPS1190 were added, hydrolysis was higher (58.2 and 57.2%, respectively). Peptides crossing 8 kDa dialysis membranes after trypsin/chymotrypsin hydrolysis were analyzed by HPSEC. The produced peptides were smaller when BLG was hydrolyzed previously by the Lb. acidophilus strain. Moreover, in the presence of pectin, the amount of the larger peptide (3.5 kDa) observed in the size exclusion chromatograms was considerably decreased. Our studies showed that prehydrolysis of BLG by Lb. acidophilus CRL 636 had a positive influence on BLG digestibility and that polysaccharides may change the peptide profile yielded by trypsin/chymotrypsin hydrolysis, releasing smaller size peptides, which are known to be less immune-reactive. Moreover, Lb. acidophilus CRL 636 was able to hydrolyze the main epitopes (41-60, 102-124, and 149-162) of BLG, reducing its allergenic content.
TI  - Methods for optimizing DNA extraction before quantifying oral bacterial numbers by real-time PCR.
AB  - Methods for the optimal extraction of genomic DNA for real-time PCR enumeration of oral bacteria using the muramidase, mutanolysin, were developed using a simple in vitro oral flora model comprised of the facultative anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Streptococcus mutans, the gram-positive anaerobe, Parvimonas micra, and the gram-negative anaerobes, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella melaninogenica and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Traditional, as well as more elaborate, methods of quantifying bacterial numbers, including colony counting and estimation of DNA content using 4',6-diamino-2-phenylindole were compared in order to validate the real-time PCR approach. Evidence was obtained that P. gingivalis nuclease activity adversely affected the extraction of double-stranded DNA from this bacterium either alone or when it formed part of a consortium with the other bacteria. This nuclease activity could be overcome by treatment of the bacteria with either 20 mM diethyl pyrocarbonate or 70% ethanol at 4 degrees C overnight. A final purification of the DNA to remove any potential PCR inhibitors was added to the protocol in order to accurately quantify the amount of DNA by real-time PCR and hence the number of bacteria in a sample.
TI  - Multivariate analysis of proteolysis patterns differentiated the impact of six strains of probiotic bacteria on a semi-hard cheese.
AB  - The individual contribution of 6 strains of probiotic bacteria (3 of Lactobacillus acidophilus and 3 of the Lactobacillus casei group) to proteolysis patterns in a semi-hard cheese was assessed. Control cheeses (without probiotics) and 2 types of experimental cheeses (with the addition of probiotics either directly to milk or by a 2-step fermentation method) were manufactured. Cheeses containing Lb. acidophilus showed the most extensive peptidolysis, which was evidenced by changes in the peptide profiles and a noticeable increase of free amino acids compared with control cheeses. The strains of the Lb. casei group showed a lower contribution to cheese peptidolysis, which consisted mainly of free amino acid increase. Two-step fermentation improved peptidolytic activity for only one of the cultures of Lb. acidophilus tested. The addition of Lb. acidophilus strains into cheese may be suitable not only for their beneficial health effect but also for their influence on secondary proteolysis, consistent with acceleration of ripening and improved flavor formation.
TI  - Effect of a synbiotic food consumption on human gut metabolic profiles evaluated  by (1)H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy.
AB  - The capacity of human lactobacilli and bifidobacteria to produce metabolites under conditions that may prevail in the human intestine has been studied "in vitro". However, the effect of systematic probiotic consumption on human metabolic phenotype has not been investigated in faeces. This paper shows the potential for the use of (1)H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ((1)H NMR) spectroscopy for studying the changes of the metabolic profiles of human faecal slurries. Faeces of 16 subjects, characterized by different natural levels of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria were recovered before and after 1 month of supplementation with a synbiotic food based on Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium longum and fructooligosaccharides, and analyzed by (1)H NMR. Multivariate statistical approach has been applied to the data obtained and particularly Canonical Discriminant Analysis of Principal Coordinates (CAP). More than 150 molecules belonging to short chain fatty acids, organic acids, esters, alcohols and amino acids were detected and quantified in the samples considered. The number and the extent of these molecules in faecal slurries were strongly affected by the synbiotic food consumption and gave rise to characteristic metabolic signature. In particular, the short chain fatty acid concentrations significantly increased while the amino acids contents decreased. The comparison of the data indicated that the intake of the synbiotic food alters the host metabolism in a measure dependent on the initial level of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria detected in the faecal specimens. The analysis of (1)H NMR profiles with CAP allowed a separation of faecal samples of the subjects on the basis of the synbiotic food intake. The multivariate statistical approach used demonstrated the potential of NMR metabolic profiles to provide biomarkers of the gut-microbial activity related to dietary supplementation of probiotics.
TI  - Investigation of oxidation in freeze-dried membranes using the fluorescent probe  C11-BODIPY(581/591).
AB  - Incorporation of the fluorescent probe C11-BODIPY(581/591) in two dried membrane  systems, soy bean phosphatidylcholine liposomes freeze-dried in a carbohydrate/protein matrix and Lactobacillus acidophilus (La-5) freeze-dried in a carbohydrate matrix, was successful and could be visualised by Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM). The C11-BODIPY(581/591) probe is a lipid oxidation reporter molecule, which is known to associate with the lipids of biological membranes and exhibit a fluorescence shift from the red range to the green range of the visible spectrum when it is oxidised together with the lipids. The present study is the first to demonstrate that the C11-BODIPY(581/591) probe can be used in dried membrane systems, and that a detection of oxidation is possible by CLSM analysis directly on the dried samples.
TI  - Live and heat-inactivated lactobacilli from feces inhibit Salmonella typhi and Escherichia coli adherence to Caco-2 cells.
AB  - A quantitative approach has been proposed to evaluate the competitive inhibition  of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi by live and heat-inactivated laboratory isolated Lactobacillus sp. on adhesion to monolayer of Caco-2 cells. Three species of Lactobacillus (L. casei, L. acidophilus, L. agilis) isolated from human neonate feces and two commercial probiotic strains (L. casei, L. acidophilus) have been compared for probiotic activity. All lactobacilli were able to attach to the Caco-2 cells, however, the degree of adhesion was bacterial strain-dependent. The adhesion indices of the two commercial probiotic strains were not significantly different from the values obtained for the other two similar fecal strains (p > 0.01). The inhibition of attachment of the pathogenic bacteria by inactivated cells of fecal L. acidophilus was examined and compared to the results of live bacteria. The inhibition pattern was similar for live and heat-inactivated L. acidophilus (p > 0.01). The number of attached pathogenic bacteria to the Caco-2 cells decreased when the number of L. acidophilus increased from 10(6) to 10(9) CFU/mL. The heat-inactivated L. acidophilus displayed similar probiotic activity compared to the live bacteria.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 increases lactacin B production when it senses live target bacteria.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 is a probiotic strain used in dairy products. Production of bacteriocin by L. acidophilus La-5 was achieved when it was grown in co-cultures with the yogurt starter species Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. However, bacteriocin induction was not observed when heat-killed cells were used as inducers. This study demonstrates that L. acidophilus La-5 produces lactacin B and that the bacteriocin expression is controlled by an auto-induction mechanism involving the secreted peptide IP_1800. The transcript level of the lactacin B gene cluster expression was investigated in co-cultures between L. acidophilus La-5 and S. thermophilus STY-31 and a remarkable increase of the bacteriocin structural gene (lbaB) transcription was observed. However, lbaB was transcribed constitutively in uninduced L. acidophilus La-5 cells, but the levels of the secreted bacteriocin were not enough to be detected by the agar diffusion assay. A new method for bacteriocin detection was formulated based on the monitoring on real time of Lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei growth in presence of the supernatant and the cell wall extracts of pure and induced L. acidophilus La-5. These results showed that part of lactacin B secreted remains adhered to cell envelope.
TI  - Does strontium play a role in the cariostatic activity of glass ionomer? Strontium diffusion and antibacterial activity.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this work was to evaluate the activity of strontium ions on the main pathogens of the oral flora. The leaching of strontium from resin modified glass ionomer cements (RMGIC) was evaluated together with its uptake by superficial dental enamel. METHODS: The antibacterial activity was measured by the growth inhibition method following exposure of supra- and sub-gingival bacteria to a range of strontium concentrations (0.19 moll(-1), 0.37 moll(-1), 0.74 moll(-1) and 1.11 moll(-1)). Strontium concentrations were analyzed chemically and migration at 5 microm and 15 microm depths was quantified by microprobe following Fuji Ortho LC application on the vestibular enamel of extracted teeth. RESULTS: Strontium was found in appreciable amounts (0.8 wt.%) in superficial enamel, but in insignificant concentrations deeper in. At the same time, 8% fluoroapatite was formed in the enamel. Under our experimental conditions, strontium had no significant antibacterial activity; only one log reduction of activity was observed at the highest concentrations tested. CONCLUSIONS: RMGIC releases strontium ions which are rapidly exchanged for calcium ions in the superficial enamel. No significant antibacterial activity was observed for strontium ions alone at the concentrations considered. However synergistic effects with fluoride could promote antibacterial activity.
TI  - The impact of the stone age diet on gingival conditions in the absence of oral hygiene.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to assess the oral microbiota and clinical data in subjects without access to traditional oral hygiene methods and who ate a diet available in the Stone Age. METHODS: Ten subjects living in an environment replicating the Stone Age for 4 weeks were enrolled in this study. Bleeding on probing (BOP), gingival and plaque indices, and probing depth (PD) were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks. Microbiologic samples were collected at the mesio-buccal subgingival aspects of all teeth and from the dorsum of the tongue and were processed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization methods. RESULTS: No subject had periodontitis. Mean BOP decreased from 34.8% to 12.6% (P <0.001). Mean gingival index scores changed from 0.38 to 0.43 (not statistically significant) and mean plaque scores increased from 0.68 to 1.47 (P <0.001). PD at sites of subgingival sampling decreased (mean difference: 0.2 mm; P <0.001). At week 4, the total bacterial count was higher (P <0.001) for 24 of 74 species, including Bacteroides ureolyticus, Eikenella corrodens, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Staphylococcus aureus (two strains), Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus anginosis, and Streptococcus mitis. Bacterial counts from tongue samples were higher at baseline (P <0.001) for 20 species, including Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; serotype a), and Streptococcus spp. CONCLUSIONS: The experimental gingivitis protocol is not applicable if the diet (e.g., Stone Age) does not include refined sugars. Although plaque levels increased, BOP and PD decreased. Subgingival bacterial counts increased for several species not linked to periodontitis, whereas tongue bacterial samples decreased during the study period.
TI  - Evaluation of an antimicrobial ingredient prepared from a Lactobacillus acidophilus casein fermentate against Enterobacter sakazakii.
AB  - Previously two antimicrobial peptides, IKHQGLPQE (caseicin A) and VLNENLLR (caseicin B), were identified following the fermentation of sodium caseinate with the proteolytic strain Lactobacillus acidophilus DPC 6026. This study evaluated the ability of these peptides to kill Enterobacter sakazakii ATCC 12868 spiked in reconstituted infant formula. The survival of E. sakazakii populations in reconstituted infant formula containing a sodium caseinate fermentate was compared with survival in formula containing positive (monocaprylin) and negative controls. The L. acidophilus DPC 6026 sodium caseinate fermentate reduced pathogen numbers by >4 log CFU/ml at 37 degrees C, comparing favorably with the activity of monocaprylin. Additionally, E. sakazakii NCTC 8155 was inoculated into pasteurized, reconstituted infant formula (6 log CFUlml) followed by the addition of increasing concentrations of the fermentate (0.21 to 6.7% [wt/vol]). At a concentration of 0.21% (wt/vol), pathogen viability was maintained over 4 h at 6.0 log CFU/ml. In contrast, pathogen numbers increased approximately 100-fold in the control formula in the same time frame. At higher final fermentate concentrations (-3.33% [wt/vol]), numbers were reduced to 0 log CFU/ml over 60 min. The spectrum of activity of the fermentate against other foodborne pathogens was also determined and shown to be effective against Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Listeria innocua. Results indicate the potential of this fermentate as a built-in protection mechanism against E. sakazakii strains in reconstituted infant formula.
TI  - Characterization of Rhamnosidases from Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus  acidophilus.
AB  - Lactobacilli are known to use plant materials as a food source. Many such materials are rich in rhamnose-containing polyphenols, and thus it can be anticipated that lactobacilli will contain rhamnosidases. Therefore, genome sequences of food-grade lactobacilli were screened for putative rhamnosidases. In the genome of Lactobacillus plantarum, two putative rhamnosidase genes (ram1(Lp) and ram2(Lp)) were identified, while in Lactobacillus acidophilus, one rhamnosidase gene was found (ramA(La)). Gene products from all three genes were produced after introduction into Escherichia coli and were then tested for their enzymatic properties. Ram1(Lp), Ram2(Lp), and RamA(La) were able to efficiently hydrolyze rutin and other rutinosides, while RamA(La) was, in addition, able to cleave naringin, a neohesperidoside. Subsequently, the potential application of Lactobacillus rhamnosidases in food processing was investigated using a single matrix, tomato pulp. Recombinant Ram1(Lp) and RamA(La) enzymes were shown to remove the rhamnose from rutinosides in this material, but efficient conversion required adjustment of the tomato pulp to pH 6. The potential of Ram1(Lp) for fermentation of plant flavonoids was further investigated by expression in the food-grade bacterium Lactococcus lactis. This system was used for fermentation of tomato pulp, with the aim of improving the bioavailability of flavonoids in processed tomato products. While import of flavonoids into L. lactis appeared to be a limiting factor, rhamnose removal was confirmed, indicating that rhamnosidase-producing bacteria may find commercial application, depending on the technological properties of the strains and enzymes.
TI  - Volatile sulfur compounds produced by probiotic bacteria in the presence of cysteine or methionine.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the abilities of various probiotic bacteria to produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) relevant to food flavour and aroma. METHODS AND RESULTS: Probiotic strains (Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM, Lactobacillus plantarum 299v, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC55730 and L. reuteri BR11), Lactobacillus delbrueckii ATCC4797, L. plantarum ATCC14917 and Lactococcus lactis MG1363 were incubated with either cysteine or methionine. Volatile compounds were captured, identified and quantified using a sensitive solid-phase microextraction (SPME) technique combined with gas chromatography coupled to a pulsed flame photometric detector (SPME/GC/PFPD). Several VSCs were identified including H(2)S, methanethiol, dimethyldisulfide and dimethyltrisulfide. The VSC profiles varied substantially for different strains of L. plantarum and L. reuteri and it was found that L. reuteri ATCC55730 and L. lactis MG1363 produced the lowest levels of VSCs (P < 0.05). Levels of VSCs generated by bacteria were found to be equivalent to, or higher than, that found in commercial cheeses. CONCLUSIONS: Several probiotic strains are able to generate considerable levels of VSCs and substantial variations in VSC generating potential exists between different strains from the same species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPORTANCE OF THE STUDY: This study demonstrates that probiotic bacteria are able to efficiently generate important flavour and aroma compounds and therefore has implications for the development of probiotic containing foods.
TI  - Dental caries vaccine.
AB  - Dental caries is one of the most common diseases in humans. In modern times, it has reached epidemic proportions. Dental caries is an infectious microbiologic disease of the teeth that results in localized dissolution and destruction of the calcified tissue. Dental caries is a mulitifactorial disease, which is caused by host, agent, and environmental factors. The time factor is important for the development and progression of dental caries. A wide group of microorganisms are identified from carious lesions of which S. mutans , Lactobacillus acidophilus , and Actinomyces viscosus are the main pathogenic species involved in the initiation and development of dental caries. In India, surveys done on school children showed caries prevalence of approximately 58%. Surveys among the U.S. population showed an incidence of 45.3% in children and 93.8% in adults with either past or present coronal caries. Huge amounts of money and time are spent in treating dental caries. Hence, the prevention and control of dental caries is the main aim of public health, eventually the ultimate objective of public health is the elimination of the disease itself. Recently, dental caries vaccines have been developed for the prevention of dental caries. These dental caries vaccines are still in the early stages.
TI  - Inhibition of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine induced colon genotoxicity in rats by the administration of probiotic curd.
AB  - Epidemiologic and experimental studies suggest that the probiotic organisms are effective in preventing colon carcinogenesis, which is the major cause of mortality and morbidity in western countries. Keeping this in view, a curd (a common Indian fermented milk product) was prepared by the addition of probiotic cultures Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei and curd culture Lactococcus lactis biovar. diacetylactis. In present study, we have evaluated the anti tumor effect of probiotic curd by monitoring the DNA damage through comet assay. The rats were allocated to four groups, first group was DMH control group, second group was probiotic curd group in which probiotic curd was given along with DMH (1,2-dimethylhydrazine) injection, third group was normal curd group in which normal curd was given along with DMH injection and fourth group was normal control group. Animals received subcutaneous injection of DMH dissolved in normal saline at a dose rate of 20 mg/kg body weight, once weekly for 15 weeks. The rats were dissected at 40th week of experiment and comet assay was done in colonic cells to assess the DNA damage. A significant reduction in DNA damage (54.7%) was observed in probiotic curd group as compared to DMH control group (88.1%). The probiotic curd was effective to significantly reduce the L:W ratio in comparison to DMH control group and normal curd. The results of present study show the protective effects of probiotic curd against DMH induced genotoxicity in colonic cells.
TI  - An improved method of microencapsulation of probiotic bacteria for their stability in acidic and bile conditions during storage.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to develop a method for applying an extra coating of palm oil and poly-L-lysine (POPL) to alginate (ALG) microcapsules to enhance the survival of probiotic bacteria. Eight strains of probiotic bacteria including Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium longum, L. salivarius, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. paracasei, B. lactis type Bl-O4, and B. lactis type Bi-07 were encapsulated using alginate alone or alginate with POPL. Electron microscopy was used to measure the size of the microcapsules and to determine their surface texture. To assess if the addition of POPL improved the viability of probiotic bacteria in acidic conditions, both ALG and POPL microcapsules were inoculated into pH 2.0 MRS broths and their viability was assessed over a 2-h incubation period. Two bile salts including oxgall bile salt and taurocholic acid were used to test the bile tolerance of probiotic bacteria entrapped in ALG and POPL microcapsules. To assess the porosity and the ability of the microcapsule to hold small molecules in an aqueous environment a water-soluble fluorescent dye, 6-carboxyflourescin (6 FAM), was encapsulated and its release was monitored using a UV spectrophotometer. The results indicated that coating the microcapsules with POPL increased the overall size of the capsules by an average of 3 microm +/- 0.67. However, microcapsules with added POPL had a much smoother surface texture when examined under an electron microscope. The results also indicated that the addition of POPL to microcapsules improved the average viability of probiotic bacteria by > 1 log CFU/mL when compared to ALG microcapsules at 2 h of exposure to acidic conditions. However, similar plate counts were observed between ALG and POPL microcapsules when exposed to bile salts. This suggests that an extra coating of POPL could be readily broken down by bile salts that are commonly found in the lower gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Upon testing the porosity of the microcapsules, findings suggest that POPL microcapsules were less porous and hold 52.2% more fluorescent dye over a 6-wk storage period.
TI  - Effect of various encapsulating materials on the stability of probiotic bacteria.
AB  - Ten probiotic bacteria, including Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium longum, L. salivarius, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. paracasei, B. lactis type Bl-04, B. lactis type Bi-07, HOWARU L. rhamnosus, and HOWARU B. bifidum, were encapsulated in various coating materials, namely alginate, guar gum, xanthan gum, locust bean gum, and carrageenan gum. The various encapsulated probiotic bacteria were studied for their acid and bile tolerance. Free probiotic organisms were used as a control. The acid tolerance of probiotic organisms was tested at pH 2 over a 2-h incubation period. Bile tolerance was tested with taurocholic acid over an 8-h incubation period. The permeability of the capsules was also examined using a water-soluble dye, 6-carboxyflourescin (6-CF). The permeability was monitored by measuring the amount of 6-CF released from the capsules during a 2-w storage period. Results indicated that probiotic bacteria encapsulated in alginate, xanthan gum, and carrageenan gum survived better (P < 0.05) than free probiotic bacteria, under acidic conditions. When free probiotic bacteria were exposed to taurocholic acid, viability was reduced by 6.36 log CFU/mL, whereas only 3.63, 3.27, and 4.12 log CFU/mL was lost in probiotic organisms encapsulated in alginate, xanthan gum, and carrageenan gum, respectively. All encapsulating materials tested released small amounts of 6-CF; however, alginate and xanthan gum retained 22.1% and 18.6% more fluorescent dye than guar gum. In general, microcapsules made of alginate, xanthan gum, and carrageenan gum greatly improved the survival of probiotic bacteria when exposed to acidic conditions and bile salts.
TI  - Assessing potential effects of inulin and probiotic bacteria on Fe availability from common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) to Caco-2 cells.
AB  - Inulin, a prebiotic, may enhance intestinal Fe absorption. Our objective was to assess the effects of supplemental inulin and 2 probiotic bacteria (B. infantis and L. acidophillus) on Fe availability to Caco-2 cells from common white and red beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). Cooked beans were mixed or not with supplemental inulin (4%, w/w), and then subjected to simulated gastrointestinal digestion (pepsin, pH 2; pancreatin, pH 7.2). Subsequently, the digests were incubated overnight with and without B. infantis or L. acidophilus. Ferritin formation in Caco-2 cells was used to evaluate Fe uptake. Total soluble phenols (Folin-Ciocalteau) and phytate (HPLC-electrochemical detection) were quantified, and the flavonoids profile (HPLC-PDA/UV detection) was monitored in the digests. Supplemental inulin did not affect Fe uptake from white nor red beans. Incubation with B. infantis increased total soluble phenols (TSP) in the digests and decreased Fe uptake. Incubation with L. acidophilus decreased TSP in the digest and increased Fe uptake. Variations in Fe uptake were not associated with soluble phytate concentrations in the digests. The largest change in flavonoids profile were found in the digests incubated with L. acidophilus, which decreased the soluble concentration of astragalin (kaempferol-3-O-glucoside). These results suggest that certain probiotics could increase Fe uptake from common beans.
TI  - Probiotics and prevention of allergic disease.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Over the past few decades, public reports have shown increasing enthusiasm for the potential health effects of probiotics. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to focus on studies, which have addressed the use of probiotics for primary prevention of atopic diseases. RECENT FINDINGS: The Finnish study of Kalliomaki was the first report to describe that the frequency of atopic dermatitis in neonates treated with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) was half that of the placebo. Recently, these results have been questioned by two trials, which reported no difference in the development of atopic dermatitis in neonates supplemented with LGG and L. acidophilus, respectively. In contrast, an unexpected increase in respiratory side-effects was observed in some studies in children who received the probiotics. Up to now no data have been released which report a positive effect of probiotics for the prevention of allergic rhinitis or asthma. Moreover, an allergen-preventive effect of probiotics for the development of atopic dermatitis could not be consistently established. SUMMARY: In conclusion, probiotics cannot be generally recommended for primary prevention of atopic disease. Further studies should clarify if any susceptible subgroups exist and how these subgroups benefit from supplementation with certain probiotic strains. Moreover, the selection of the most beneficial probiotic strain or the composition of different probiotics and/or prebiotics, the dose and the timing of supplementation still need to be determined.
TI  - Probiotic in lamb rennet paste enhances rennet lipolytic activity, and conjugated linoleic acid and linoleic acid content in Pecorino cheese.
AB  - Cheeses manufactured using traditional lamb rennet paste, lamb rennet paste containing Lactobacillus acidophilus, and lamb rennet paste containing a mix of Bifidobacterium lactis and Bifidobacterium longum were characterized for the lipolytic pattern during ripening. Lipase activity of lamb rennet paste, lamb rennet containing Lb. acidophilus, and lamb rennet containing a mix of bifidobacteria was measured in sheep milk cream substrate. Rennet paste containing probiotics showed a lipase activity 2-fold greater than that displayed by traditional rennet. Total free fatty acid (FFA) in sheep milk cream was lower in lamb rennet paste (981 microg/g of milk cream) than in lamb rennet containing Lb. acidophilus (1,382.4 microg/g of milk cream) and in lamb rennet containing a mix of bifidobacteria (1,227.5 microg/g of milk cream) according to lipase activity of lamb rennet paste. The major increase of FFA in all cheeses occurred during the first 30 d of ripening with the greatest values being observed for C16:0, C18:0 C18:1. At 60 d of ripening all cheeses showed a reduction in the amount of free fatty acids; in particular, total free fatty acids underwent a decrease of more than 30% from 30 to 60 d in cheeses manufactured using traditional lamb rennet paste, whereas the same parameter decreased 10% in cheeses manufactured using lamb rennet paste containing Lb. acidophilus and cheeses manufactured using lamb rennet paste containing a mix of B. lactis and B. longum. Cheese containing Lb. acidophilus was characterized by the greatest levels of total conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) 9-cis, 11-trans CLA and 9-trans, 11-trans CLA, whereas cheese containing bifidobacteria displayed the greatest levels of free linoleic acid. Rennet pastes containing viable cells of Lb. acidophilus and a mix of B. lactis and B. longum were able to influence the amount of FFA and CLA in Pecorino cheese during ripening.
TI  - Development and application of a upp-based counterselective gene replacement system for the study of the S-layer protein SlpX of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM.
AB  - In silico genome analysis of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM coupled with gene expression studies have identified putative genes and regulatory networks that are potentially important to this organism's survival, persistence, and activities in the gastrointestinal tract. Correlation of key genotypes to phenotypes requires an efficient gene replacement system. In this study, use of the upp-encoded uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRTase) of L. acidophilus NCFM was explored as a counterselection marker to positively select for recombinants that have resolved from chromosomal integration of pORI-based plasmids. An isogenic mutant carrying a upp gene deletion was constructed and was resistant to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a toxic uracil analog that is also a substrate for UPRTase. A 3.0-kb pORI-based counterselectable integration vector bearing a upp expression cassette, pTRK935, was constructed and introduced into the Deltaupp host harboring the pTRK669 helper plasmid. Extrachromosomal replication of pTRK935 complemented the mutated chromosomal upp allele and restored sensitivity to 5-FU. This host background provides a platform for a two-step plasmid integration and excision strategy that can select for plasmid-free recombinants with either the wild-type or mutated allele of the targeted gene in the presence of 5-FU. The efficacy of the system was demonstrated by in-frame deletion of the slpX gene (LBA0512) encoding a novel 51-kDa secreted protein associated with the S-layer complex of L. acidophilus. The resulting DeltaslpX mutant exhibited lower growth rates, increased sensitivity to sodium dodecyl sulfate, and greater resistance to bile. Overall, this improved gene replacement system represents a valuable tool for investigating the mechanisms underlying the probiotic functionality of L. acidophilus.
TI  - Role of autoinducer-2 on the adhesion ability of Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - AIMS: Lactobacilli adhere to the intestinal epithelium and this intimate association likely promotes retention in the gastrointestinal tract and communication with the immune system. The aim of this study was to investigate whether or not the quorum-sensing signalling molecule, autoinducer (AI)-2, was produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus and affected adherence to intestinal epithelial cells. METHODS: Microarray analysis of concentrated cells of L. acidophilus NCFM revealed several genes involved in a classic stress response and potentially adhesion. Putative genes linked to the synthesis of the interspecies signalling molecule, AI-2, were overexpressed. Examination of the NCFM genome revealed the complete pathway for AI-2 synthesis. AI-2 activity from NCFM was detected using the Vibrio harveyi BB170 assay system. Using site-specific integration, an isogenic mutation was created in luxS and the resulting mutant did not produce AI-2. In addition to some minor metabolic effects, the luxS mutation resulted in 58% decrease in adherence to Caco-2 cells. CONCLUSION: L. acidophilus NCFM encodes the genes for synthesis of the quorum-sensing signal, AI-2, and produces this molecule during planktonic growth. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The ability to produce AI-2 affects the ability of L. acidophilus to attach to intestinal epithelial cells.
TI  - Characterization of vaginal lactobacilli coaggregation ability with Escherichia coli.
AB  - The coaggregation abilities of probiotic strains might enable it to form a barrier that prevents colonization by pathogenic bacteria. In the present study, the characterization of the coaggregation ability of 19 vaginal lactobacilli was studied. Coaggregation ability of all lactobacilli with Escherichia coli ATCC 11229 was positive. Only the highest coaggregation percentage of Lactobacillus acidophilus S1 was obtained with E. coli ATCC 11229 under both aerobic (71%) and anaerobic conditions (62%). The coaggregation abilities of strains occurred higher at acidic pH than at basic pH values. Moreover, the coaggregation abilities of tested strains against E. coli decreased after heat treatment (70 or 85 degrees C). Also, the relationship between hydrophobicity and coaggregation of strains was found to be significant. The effect of sonication, some enzymes (lipase and pepsin) and sodium periodate on coaggregation ability of L. acidophilus S1, which is one of the highest potentials on coaggregation ability, was investigated. Sodium periodate did not have a significant effect on coaggregation ability of L. acidophilus S1. The sonicated cell showed lower coaggregation than the control, the supernatant fluid of this sonicated cells showed similar coaggregation ability to the control. Coaggregation abilities of bacteriotherapeutic lactobacilli with pathogenic bacteria can be used for preliminary screening in order to identify potentially probiotic bacteria suitable for human use against urogenital tract infections.
TI  - Probiotics in the arabian gulf region.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Available reports on adherence to recommended guidelines for labeling  of probiotic products are based on assessment of these products in developed countries. In the Arabian Gulf region, there is a paucity of data on the characterization of probiotic products and an absence of local guidelines for their labeling. This study, carried out in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), represents the first evaluation of probiotic products available in the Arabian Peninsula. METHODS: Probiotic products were purchased over the counter from a variety of sources, including pharmacies, healthfood stores, and supermarkets across the UAE. All identified products were listed and information regarding type of product preparation and labeling information were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 37 probiotic products, 15 dairy-based and 22 non-dairy-based were identified. The dairy products comprised of 12 yogurts, two fermented milk products and one powdered baby formula. The majority of non-dairy products were in capsule form (n = 16). While all the non-dairy products gave information about the strain of probiotic microorganism and number present at time of manufacture, this information was provided for only one dairy-based product. Strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus were the most common probiotic organisms identified. However, one probiotic product listed Enterococcus faecalis (750 million viable bacteria per capsule) as a component. With the exception of one non-dairy-based product, all health-related claims were structure/function statements, according to the US Food and Drug Administration nomenclature. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that a wide variety of probiotic products are available in the Arabian Gulf. Development of guidelines for labeling of these probiotic products and use of structure/function statements and health claims should be addressed.
TI  - Comparative genomics of lactic acid bacteria reveals a niche-specific gene set.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The recently sequenced genome of Lactobacillus helveticus DPC4571 revealed a dairy organism with significant homology (75% of genes are homologous) to a probiotic bacteria Lb. acidophilus NCFM. This led us to hypothesise that a group of genes could be determined which could define an organism's niche. RESULTS: Taking 11 fully sequenced lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as our target, (3 dairy LAB, 5 gut LAB and 3 multi-niche LAB), we demonstrated that the presence or absence of certain genes involved in sugar metabolism, the proteolytic system, and restriction modification enzymes were pivotal in suggesting the niche of a strain. We identified 9 niche specific genes, of which 6 are dairy specific and 3 are gut specific. The dairy specific genes identified in Lactobacillus helveticus DPC4571 were lhv_1161 and lhv_1171, encoding components of the proteolytic system, lhv_1031 lhv_1152, lhv_1978 and lhv_0028 encoding restriction endonuclease genes, while bile salt hydrolase genes lba_0892 and lba_1078, and the sugar metabolism gene lba_1689 from Lb. acidophilus NCFM were identified as gut specific genes. CONCLUSION: Comparative analysis revealed that if an organism had homologs to the dairy specific geneset, it probably came from a dairy environment, whilst if it had homologs to gut specific genes, it was highly likely to be of intestinal origin.We propose that this "barcode" of 9 genes will be a useful initial guide to researchers in the LAB field to indicate an organism's ability to occupy a specific niche.
TI  - Effect of probiotics Lactobacillus acidophilus on Citrobacter rodentium colitis:  the role of dendritic cells.
AB  - Modulation of the intestinal immune response early in life by administration of probiotic bacteria may be an effective strategy for preventing or attenuating infectious diarrhea. We preinoculated the mice early in life with the probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM (La) at age 2 wk. Dendritic cells (DCs) were collected and purified from mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and spleens of the BalbC/ByJ mice. DC isolation and adoptive transfer was used to examine the function of probiotics. We demonstrated that when mice were adoptively transferred with La-primed DCs (t-LaDC) instead of oral consumption with La, there was a similar effect on fecal bacteria counts, IgA levels, and colonic histopathology, as well as cytokine levels in MLN when there was intestinal bacterial infection. The above findings suggest that DCs play a key role in probiotics attenuating Citrobacter rodentium (Cr) colitis. Moreover, the location of La-primed DC hints that there is interaction of DCs and T cells in the digestive system of the host. Up-regulated expression of a surface marker on DCs indicated that inoculation with probiotics will stimulate the function of DCs, thereby further increasing immune response triggered by DC.
TI  - Dendritic cell targeting of Bacillus anthracis protective antigen expressed by Lactobacillus acidophilus protects mice from lethal challenge.
AB  - Efficient vaccines potentiate antibody avidity and increase T cell longevity, which confer protection against microbial lethal challenge. A vaccine strategy was established by using Lactobacillus acidophilus to deliver Bacillus anthracis protective antigen (PA) via specific dendritic cell-targeting peptides to dendritic cells (DCs), which reside in the periphery and mucosal surfaces, thus directing and regulating acquired immunity. The efficiency of oral delivery of L. acidophilus expressing a PA-DCpep fusion was evaluated in mice challenged with lethal B. anthracis Sterne. Vaccination with L. acidophilus expressing PA-DCpep induced robust protective immunity against B. anthracis Sterne compared with mice vaccinated with L. acidophilus expressing PA-control peptide or an empty vector. Additionally, serum anti-PA titers, neutralizing PA antibodies, and the levels of IgA-expressing cells were all comparable with the historical recombinant PA plus aluminum hydroxide vaccine administered s.c. Collectively, development of this strategy for oral delivery of DC-targeted antigens provides a safe and protective vaccine via a bacterial adjuvant that may potentiate mucosal immune responses against deadly pathogens.
TI  - Temporal gene expression and probiotic attributes of Lactobacillus acidophilus during growth in milk.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria have been used as starter strains in the production of fermented dairy products for centuries. Lactobacillus acidophilus is a widely recognized probiotic bacteria commonly added to yogurt and used in dietary supplements. In this study, a whole genome microarray was employed to monitor gene expression of L. acidophilus NCFM cells propagated in 11% skim milk during early, mid and late logarithmic phase, and stationary phase. Approximately 21% of 1,864 open reading frames were differentially expressed at least in one time point. Genes differentially expressed in skim milk included several members of the proteolytic enzyme system. Expression of prtP (proteinase precursor) and prtM (maturase) increased over time as well as several peptidases and transport systems. Expression of Opp1 (oligopeptide transport system 1) was highest at 4 h, whereas gene expression of Opp2 increased over time reaching its highest level at 12 h, suggesting that the 2 systems have different specificities. Expression of a 2-component regulatory system, previously shown to regulate acid tolerance and proteolytic activity, also increased during the early log and early stationary phases of growth. Expression of the genes involved in lactose utilization increased immediately (5 min) upon exposure to milk. The acidification activity, survival under storage conditions, and adhesion to mucin and Caco-2 tissue culture cells of selected mutants containing insertionally inactivated genes differentially expressed in the wild-type strain during growth in milk were examined for any potential links between probiotic properties and bacterial growth and survival in milk. Some of the most interesting genes found to be expressed in milk were correlated with signaling (autoinducer-2) and adherence to mucin and intestinal epithelial cells, in vitro.
TI  - Cholesterol-lowering effect of probiotic yogurt in comparison with ordinary yogurt in mildly to moderately hypercholesterolemic subjects.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Hypercholesterolemia is the most important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we compared the effect of consuming probiotic yogurt with that of ordinary yogurt on serum cholesterol level in mildly to moderately hypercholesterolemic subjects. METHODS: This randomized and crossover trial included 14 healthy subjects with serum total cholesterol 5.17-7.76 mmol/l. They did not consume yogurt for a 2-week prestudy period and added 300 g/day of milk to their diet. After this period, they were randomly allocated to 2 groups to receive either 300 g of ordinary yogurt or probiotic yogurt (fermented with a starter composed of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis in addition to bacteria in ordinary yogurt) for 6 weeks as a substitution for milk. After a 4-week washout period, the crossover was made and the study lasted for another 6 weeks. Blood lipid tests were done at the beginning and at the end of each period. RESULTS: Consumption of probiotic yogurt in comparison with ordinary yogurt caused a significant decrease in serum total cholesterol (p < 0.05). Comparison of other blood lipid indices did not show any significant differences between these 2 periods. CONCLUSION: Yogurt containing two probiotic bacteria strains, L. acidophilus and B. lactis, had a cholesterol-lowering effect in hypercholesterolemic subjects.
TI  - Production of conjugated linoleic acid by probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5.
AB  - AIMS: To study the ability of the probiotic culture Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 to produce conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which is a potent anti-carcinogenic agent. METHODS AND RESULTS: The conversion of linoleic acid to CLA was studied both by fermentation in a synthetic medium and by incubation of washed cells. Accumulation of CLA was monitored by gas chromatography analysis of the biomass and supernatants. While the fermentation conditions applied may not be optimal to observe CLA production in growing La-5 cells, the total CLA surpassed 50% of the original content in the washed cells after 48 h under both aerobic and micro-aerobic conditions. The restriction of oxygen did not increase the yield, but favoured the formation of trans, trans isomers. CONCLUSIONS: The capability of L. acidophilus La-5 to produce CLA is not dependant on the presence of milk fat or anaerobic conditions. Regulation of CLA production in this strain needs to be further investigated to exploit the CLA potential in fermented foods. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Knowledge gained through the conditions on the accumulation of CLA would provide further insight into the fermentation of probiotic dairy products. The capacity of the nongrowing cells to produce CLA is also of great relevance for the emerging nonfermented probiotic foods.
TI  - Water activity-temperature state diagrams of freeze-dried Lactobacillus acidophilus (La-5): influence of physical state on bacterial survival during storage.
AB  - Water activity-temperature state diagrams for Lactobacillus acidophilus freeze-dried in a sucrose or a lactose matrix were established based on determination of stabilized glass transition temperatures by differential scanning calorimetry during equilibration with respect to water activity at fixed temperatures. The bacteria in the lactose matrix had higher stabilized glass transition temperatures for all a(w) investigated. The survival of Lactobacillus acidophilus determined as colony forming units for up to 10 weeks of storage at 20 degrees C for (i) a(w) = 0.11 with both freeze-dried matrices in the glassy state, (ii) a(w) = 0.23 with the bacteria in the lactose matrix in a glassy state but with the bacteria in sucrose matrix in the nonglassy state, and (iii) a(w) = 0.43 with both freeze-dried matrices in a nonglassy state showed that the nature of the sugar was more important for storage stability than the physical state of the matrix with the nonreducing sucrose providing better stability than the reducing lactose.
TI  - Effect of moderate electric field frequency and growth stage on the cell membrane permeability of Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Changes in growth kinetics and metabolic activity of microorganisms under the presence of a moderate electric field (MEF) have been hypothesized as being due to temporary permeabilization of cell membranes. We investigated herein the effects of frequency and growth stage on cell membrane permeabilization of Lactobacillus acidophilus OSU 133 during MEF fermentation. Cells were stained with two fluorescent nucleic acid stains: the green, nonselective, cell membrane permeable SYTO 9, and the red, cell membrane impermeable propidium iodide (PI). Fluorescence exhibition post-treatment was assessed using fluorescence microscopy. Total plate counting was done to determine whether or not the permeabilized population represented live cells. Fermentation treatments investigated were conventional (control) and MEF (2 V/cm, 45, 60, 1,000, 10,000 Hz) at 30 degrees C. Studies were conducted at 45 Hz for lag, exponential, and stationary phases of growth. Low frequency MEF treated cells exhibited significantly greater numbers of red cell counts than conventional treatments; further, no significant differences existed in viable counts between MEF and conventional treatments, suggesting that the red counts represent permeabilized live cells. MEF treatments at the early stage of bacterial growth at 45 Hz exhibited the maximum permeabilization followed by treatments at 60 Hz. MEF treated samples at frequencies higher than 60 Hz did not exhibit red fluorescence. Cells at lag phase showed the greatest susceptibility to permeabilization followed by those at exponential phase. No evidence of electroporation was observed during the stationary phase. To our knowledge, these observations provide the first evidence that cell membrane permeabilization occurs under the presence of electric fields as low as those under MEF.
TI  - Effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus on gut microflora metabolic biomarkers in fed and fasted rats.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about fasting effects on gut bacterial metabolism. As probiotics are purported to be beneficial for health, this study aimed to investigate the response of gut microbial metabolism on fasting with or without probiotic administration. METHODS: Sixty male adult Wistar rats were allocated to six experimental treatments, for 6 days, arranged under three nutritional schemes namely: (a) ad libitum feeding (control), (b) fasting for 3 days and re-feeding for the remainder (re-fed) and (c) fasting for 6 days combined with parenteral liquid treatment during the last 3 days (starved). Each nutritional scheme had one non-probiotic and one probiotic treatment receiving orally Lactobacillus acidophilus. Rat caecal digesta were analyzed for bacterial enzyme activities and volatile fatty acids (VFA). RESULTS: Fasted rats had significantly lower activities of alpha-galactosidase, alpha-glucosidase and beta-glucosidase and higher activities of beta-galactosidase and azoreductase compared to control and re-fed rats, irrespective of probiotic administration. Results were variable regarding cholylglycine hydrolase (CGH), while there were no differences between treatments regarding beta-glucuronidase and arylsulfatase activity. Fasted rats had significantly lower caecal VFA concentration and different fermentation patterns. L. acidophilus resulted in significantly reduced azoreductase activity and increased caecal acetate levels in fasted rats. Re-feeding appeared to restore most enzyme activities, fermentation intensity and to some extent fermentation patterns at control treatment levels. L. acidophilus resulted in significantly reduced CGH activity and increased butyrate levels in re-fed rats. CONCLUSION: The results indicate a health beneficial potential of L. acidophilus in fasted and re-fed nutritional states via reduction of harmful azoreductase and CGH activities and promotion of useful VFA components for colonic function and health.
TI  - B-cell activation in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
AB  - Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may have a low grade immune activation. However, little is known about the properties of B cells of IBS patients. We therefore investigated activation level and antigen presenting phenotype of blood B cells of IBS patients. We also examined B-cell responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and probiotic bacteria. Blood samples were obtained from 74 IBS patients and 30 healthy subjects. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and stimulated with LPS or an UV-light inactivated bacterial cocktail consisting of the probiotic Gram-positive strains; Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei 19, Lactobacillus acidophilus La5, Bifidobacterium lactis B612. The phenotype of CD19(+) B cells was investigated by flow cytometry before and after 72 h cell culture. Furthermore, IBS symptom severity was assessed. B cells isolated from blood of IBS patients displayed an amplified activation level as demonstrated by increased cell surface expression of IgG, and also the costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86. Expression of antigen presenting HLA-DR and costimulatory molecule CD40 on B cells was, however comparable in IBS patients and controls. B cells of IBS patients displayed an impaired ability to increase expression of CD80, but not CD86, in response to both LPS as well as probiotic bacteria stimulations. To conclude, blood B cells of IBS patients have an increased activation level. Bacterial component induced expression of the costimulatory molecule CD80, regarded as important for tolerance induction, is impaired. These data suggest that B-cell antigen presentation in IBS patients is associated with altered capacity of providing costimulation to T cells.
TI  - Quantification of Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. in rat fecal samples by real-time PCR.
AB  - The microbiota of the rat intestinal tract constitutes a complex ecosystem of microorganisms. We have developed a real-time quantitative PCR assay based on genus-specific 16S rDNA primers and 3' minor groove binder (MGB) probes for accurate detection and quantification of a wide range of Bifidobacterium spp. (30 species) and Lactobocillus spp. (15 species) in rat fecal samples. Real-time PCR detection of serially diluted DNA isolated from reference strains of Bifidobacterium longum and Lactobacillus acidophilus was linear for cell counts ranging from 10(6) to 10 cells per PCR assay. The method proved applicable to the detection of Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. at concentrations down to 10 CFU per PCR, corresponding to 5 x 10(4) CFU/g feces. The inter-extract reproducibility was high, with a coefficient of variation ranging from 0.24% to 1.07% for the Bifidobacterium assay and from 0.05% to 1.28% for the Lactobacillus assay. We conclude that real-time PCR is a very sensitive and precise technique for extensive quantitative evaluation of gut Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. Thus, the approach used here to detect and quantify bacteria with group-specific primers should contribute to further studies of the composition and dynamics of the rat intestinal microbiota.
TI  - Distribution of selected cariogenic bacteria in five different intra-oral habitats in young children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the colonization patterns and composition of the oral microbiota can lead to a better understanding of disease initiation. AIM: The aim of this study was to examine the distribution of selected cariogenic bacteria in samples from five different oral habitats in young Greek children. DESIGN: Ninety-three children 3-12 years old (mean + SD 7.9 +/- 2.5) (60.2% male, 39.8% female) participated and split into three different age groups: primary (3-6 years), early mixed (6-9 years), and mixed dentition (9-12 years). Samples for bacterial enumeration were taken from saliva, supragingival and subgingival plaque, tongue dorsum, and soft tissues from each child, and were further analysed using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: Mean counts and proportions of all the test bacteria differed significantly among sample locations. Cariogenic bacteria were present in almost all healthy children. Mean proportions of Streptococcus mutans isolated from soft tissue and Streptococcus sanguinis from soft tissue, subgingival and saliva samples increased significantly with age, whereas the opposite was seen for Lactobacillus acidophilus. CONCLUSIONS: Cariogenic bacteria were present in almost all young children. Soft tissues, saliva, and tongue were more often colonized by cariogenic streptococcal species than teeth. These surfaces may serve as reservoirs for oral pathogens, requiring attention during preventive interventions.
TI  - Development and use of tuf gene-based primers for the multiplex PCR detection of  Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei group, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, and Bifidobacterium longum in commercial dairy products.
AB  - PCR primers specific for the detection of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei group, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, and Bifidobacterium longum were designed based on the elongation factor Tu gene (tuf). The specificity of these four primer sets were confirmed by PCR with 88 bacterial strains of Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Bifidobacterium, and other bacterial species. Results indicated that these primer sets generated predicted PCR products of 397, 230, 202, and 161 bp for L. acidophilus, L. delbrueckii, L. casei group, and B. longum, respectively. Bacterial species other than the target organisms tested did not generate false-positive results. When these four primer sets were combined for the simultaneous detection of the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in fermented milk products including yogurt, the LAB species listed on the labels of these products could be identified without the preenrichment step. The identification limit for each LAB strain with this multiplex PCR method was N X 10(3) CFU/ml in milk samples. The results of our multiplex PCR method were confirmed by PCR assay using primers based on the 16S rDNA or the 16S-23S intergenic spacer region and by biochemical tests using the API 50 CHL kit. When this multiplex PCR method was used with the determination of counts of total viable LAB and bifidobacteria, the quality of commercial fermented milk products could be assured.
TI  - Influence of oligosaccharides on the growth and tolerance capacity of lactobacilli to simulated stress environment.
AB  - AIMS: Lactobacilli should resist stress environments in industry process and gastrointestinal tract before exerting their beneficial effects. To explore the possible stabilizers in probiotic products, prebiotic oligosaccharides were investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated the effect of four selected oligosaccharides on the survival of probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum and L. acidophilus to simulated stress conditions. It was found that the tolerance of lactobacilli to simulated artificial gastrointestinal juice, heat treatment and phenol solution was obviously enhanced in fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) and xylo-oligosaccharides (XOS) group. In addition, chito-oligosaccharides (COS), manno-oligosaccharides (MOS) and glucose also had positive effect compared with control group (without sugar). CONCLUSIONS: Prebiotic oligosaccharides, especially XOS and FOS added in medium have protection function to lactobacilli in stress environments. The protection function of oligosaccharides may correlate with the bacteria growth, which was stimulated by these oligosaccharides. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Prebiotic oligosaccharides may be used as stabilizers in probiotic products.
TI  - Effect of supplement with lactic-acid producing bacteria on fatigue and physical  activity in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome.
AB  - Disturbances in intestinal microbial ecology and in the immune system of the host have been implicated as a part of the pathogenesis in chronic fatigue syndrome. Probiotic lactic acid producing bacteria have been shown to prevent and alleviate gastrointestinal disturbances and to normalize the cytokine profile which might be of an advantage for patients suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei F19, Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFB 1748 and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 on fatigue and physical activity in CFS patients. Fifteen patients fulfilling the criteria set by international researchers in the field at the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in 1994 for chronic fatigue syndrome, were included in the study. The patients had high fatigue severity scores and high disability scores. During the first two weeks baseline observations without treatment were assessed, succeeded by four weeks of intake of a probiotic product and a four-week follow-up period. The fatigue, health and physical activity was assessed by the use of the Visual Analogue Scales and the SF-12 Health Survey. Faecal samples were collected and the normal microflora was analysed. Neurocognitive functions improved during the study period while there were no significant changes in fatigue and physical activity scores. No major changes occurred in the gastrointestinal microflora. At the end of the study 6 of 15 patients reported that they had improved according to the assessment described. The findings in this study that improvement of health is possible to achieve should encourage further studies with interventions with probiotics in patients with CFS.
TI  - Pretreatment but not treatment with probiotics abolishes mouse intestinal barrier dysfunction in acute pancreatitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intestinal barrier failure during acute pancreatitis (AP) is associated with translocation of luminal bacteria, resulting in infectious complications. We examined the effects of multispecies probiotics on the intestinal barrier impairment in a murine model of AP. METHODS: Mice were injected with cerulein to induce AP and were sacrificed 11 (early AP) or 72 hours (late AP) after start of induction. AP and associated systemic effects were confirmed by histology of pancreas and lung. Animals received daily probiotics starting 2 days prior to AP induction (pretreatment) or at the moment of AP induction (treatment). Mucosal barrier function of the distal ileum was assessed in Ussing chambers by measurement of the epithelial electrical resistance and the permeability to Na-fluorescein. RESULTS: Histological analysis revealed pancreatic injury in both phases of AP, and lung damage in the early phase. Epithelial resistance of the ileum was reduced and permeability increased in both phases of AP, indicating impairment of the intestinal barrier. Pretreatment had no effect on resistance or permeability in the early phase of AP. In the late phase of AP, pretreatment but not treatment abolished the AP induced resistance decrease and permeability increase. Administration of probiotics as such (ie, without induction of AP) had no effect on intestinal barrier function. CONCLUSION: Pretreatment with multispecies probiotics for 2 days abolishes intestinal barrier dysfunction in the late phase of AP, while treatment does not. The effectiveness of probiotics in this model depends on the timing of administration. Clinical trials with probiotics should seek conditions where treatment can be started prior to onset of disease or elective surgical intervention.
TI  - [Cloning, expression and characterization of a heterodimeric beta-galactosidase from Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356].
AB  - Heterodimeric beta-galactosidase of Lactobacillus acidophilus belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 2, encoded by two overlapping and translational coupling genes, lacL and lacM. The lacL and lacM genes of the sequenced strain L. acidophilus NCFM encode polypeptides with calculated molecular masses of 73,253 and 35,817 Da, respectively. OBJECTIVE: To clone, overexpress and characterize the enzyme in Escherichia coli. METHODS: We cloned the fragment (2834 bp) containing ribose-binding site (RBS) and coding regions of the lacLM genes from L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 into expression vector pQE31. RBS and HIS-Tag of pQE31 were substituted by inserted fragment. Recombinant plasmid was electrotransformed into E. coli JM109. Expression product was purified by ammonium sulphate fractionation, anion-exchange, affinity chromatography and gel permeation. Native molecular mass of homogenous enzyme was measured by gel permeation, and beta-galactosidase activity was determined by using o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) as the substrate. RESULTS: Overexpression of the soluble enzyme in E. coli was achieved. Amino acid residue 512 of recombinant LacL was different from that of L. acidophilus NCFM. Homogenous enzyme was obtained by purification. The homogenous enzyme had a specific activity of 226 U/mg protein, a native molecular mass of 96.3+/-4.6 kDa, an optimum temperature at 49 degrees C and an optimum pH of 7. The Km and Vmax values of the enzyme were 2.18+/-0.12 mmol/L, 273+/-5 U/mg protein respectively.
TI  - Modeling bacterial contamination of fuel ethanol fermentation.
AB  - The emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria may limit the effectiveness of antibiotics to treat bacterial contamination in fuel ethanol plants, and therefore, new antibacterial intervention methods and tools to test their application are needed. Using shake-flask cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown on saccharified corn mash and strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from a dry-grind ethanol facility, a simple model to simulate bacterial contamination and infection was developed. Challenging the model with 10(8) CFU/mL Lactobacillus fermentum decreased ethanol yield by 27% and increased residual glucose from 6.2 to 45.5 g/L. The magnitude of the effect was proportional to the initial bacterial load, with 10(5) CFU/mL L. fermentum still producing an 8% decrease in ethanol and a 3.2-fold increase in residual glucose. Infection was also dependent on the bacterial species used to challenge the fermentation, as neither L. delbrueckii ATCC 4797 nor L. amylovorus 0315-7B produced a significant decrease in ethanol when inoculated at a density of 10(8) CFU/mL. In the shake-flask model, treatment with 2 microg/mL virginiamycin mitigated the infection when challenged with a susceptible strain of L. fermentum (MIC for virginiamycin < or =2 ppm), but treatment was ineffective at treating infection by a resistant strain of L. fermentum (MIC = 16 ppm). The model may find application in developing new antibacterial agents and management practices for use in controlling contamination in the fuel ethanol industry.
TI  - Dahi containing probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei has a protective effect against Salmonella enteritidis infection in mice.
AB  - Salmonella enteritidis infection has received attention during recent years owing to its high prevalence worldwide. In the present study, the protective effect of probiotic dahi (curd) supplemented with Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. casei against Salmonella enteritidis infection in mice is investigated. Seven days pre-feeding with probiotic dahi significantly increased anti-S. enteritidis sIgA (secretary IgA) antibodies and lymphocyte proliferation in S. enteritidis infected mice. IL-2, IL-6 and IFN-gamma production were significantly increased in supernatant of cultured splenocytes collected from mice pre-fed with probiotic dahi, while IL-4 levels were not changed significantly. Moreover, activities of beta-galactosidase and beta-glucuronidase, and counts of S. enteritidis in intestine, liver and spleen were decreased, whereas total lactobacilli in faeces were increased in mice pre-fed with probiotic dahi. Pre-feeding of probiotic dahi for 7 days was more effective than 2 days pre-feeding. Thus, the results indicate that, pre-feeding with probiotic dahi ameliorated S. enteritidis infection by stimulating specific and non-specific immune response. Above all, it lowered colonization of gastrointestinal tract as well as translocation of S. enteritidis.
TI  - The inability of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus to form a biofilm in vitro on dentine pretreated with ozone.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of ozone therapy in the treatment of dental caries is equivocal. The aim of this study was to use an in vitro model to determine the effects of prior ozone application to dentine on biofilm formation and to measure any associated reduction in bacteria viability. METHODS: Twenty dentine discs were bonded to the bases of 5 mL polycarbonate screw top vials. Ten dentine discs were infused with ozone for 40 seconds, 10 samples remained untreated as a control. The vials were filled with nutrient medium, sterilized and placed into the outflow from a continuous chemostat culture of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus for four weeks. At the conclusion of the experiment bacterial growth was monitored by taking optical density readings of the growth medium in each vial and the outer surface of the dentine specimens were examined by scanning electron microscopy as shown by SEM analysis. RESULTS: Ozone infusion prevented biofilm formation on all the treated samples while there was substantial biofilm present on the control specimens. While the average optical density of the control specimens was almost twice that of the ozone infused dentine (0.710 for the control with a SD of 0.288 and 0.446 for the ozonated samples with a SD of 0.371), the results were not significant (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study has shown that the infusion of ozone into non-carious dentine prevented biofilm formation in vitro from S. mutans and L. acidophilus over a four-week period. The possibility exists that ozone treatment may alter the surface wettability of dentine through reaction with organic constituents.
TI  - Antagonistic potential against pathogenic microorganisms and hydrogen peroxide production of indigenous lactobacilli isolated from vagina of Chinese pregnant women.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the indigenous lactobacilli from the vagina of pregnant women and to screen the isolates with antagonistic potential against pathogenic microorganisms. METHODS: The strains were isolated from pregnant women's vagina and identified using the API50CH system. The ability of the isolates to produce hydrogen peroxide was analyzed semi-quantitatively using the TMB-HRP-MRS agar. The antagonistic effects of the isolates on pathogenic microorganisms were determined with a double layer agar plate. RESULTS: One hundred and three lactobacilli strains were isolated from 60 samples of vaginal secretion from healthy pregnant women. Among them, 78 strains could produce hydrogen peroxide, in which 68%, 80%, 80%, and 88% had antagonistic effects against Candida albicans CMCC98001, Staphylococcus aureus CMCC26003, Escherichia coli CMCC44113, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa CMCC10110, respectively. CONCLUSION: The recovery of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli decreases with the increasing pregnant age and time. The most commonly isolated species from vagina of Chinese pregnant women are Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus crispatus. Most of L. acidophilus and L. crispatus produce a high H2O2 level.
TI  - Suitability of high pressure-homogenized milk for the production of probiotic fermented milk containing Lactobacillus paracasei and Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - High pressure homogenization (HPH) is one of the most promising alternatives to traditional thermal treatment for food preservation and diversification. In order to evaluate its potential for the production of fermented milks carrying probiotic bacteria, four types of fermented milks were manufactured from HPH treated and heat treated (HT) milk with and without added probiotics. Microbiological, physicochemical and organoleptic analyses were carried out during the refrigerated period (35 d at 4 degrees C). HPH application to milk did not modify the viability of the probiotic cultures but did increase the cell loads of the starter cultures (ca. 1 log order) compared with traditional products. The coagula from HPH-milk was significantly more compacted (P<0.05) (higher firmness) than that obtained with HT-milk, and it had the highest values of consistency, cohesiveness and viscosity indexes compared with fermented milks produced without HPH treatment. All the samples received high sensory analysis scores for each descriptor considered. HPH treatment of milk can potentially diversify the market for probiotic fermented milks, especially in terms of texture parameters.
TI  - Maple sap as a rich medium to grow probiotic lactobacilli and to produce lactic acid.
AB  - AIMS: To demonstrate the feasibility of growing lactobacilli and producing lactic acid using maple sap as a sugar source and to show the importance of oligosaccharides in the processes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two maple sap samples (Cetta and Pinnacle) and purified sucrose were used as carbon sources in the preparation of three culture media. Compared with the sucrose-based medium, both maple sap-based media produced increased viable counts in two strains out of five by a factor of four to seven. Maple sap-based media also enhanced lactic acid production in three strains. Cetta sap was found to be more efficient than Pinnacle sap in stimulating lactic acid production and, was also found to be richer in various oligosaccharides. The amendment of the Pinnacle-based medium with trisaccharides significantly stimulated Lactobacillus acidophilus AC-10 to grow and produce lactic acid. CONCLUSIONS: Maple sap, particularly if rich in oligosaccharides, represents a good carbon source for the growth of lactobacilli and the production of lactic acid. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study provides a proof-of-concept, using maple sap as a substrate for lactic acid production and for the development of a nondairy probiotic drink.
TI  - Probiotic administration alters the gut flora and attenuates colitis in mice administered dextran sodium sulfate.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics are used in the therapy of inflammatory bowel disease. This study aimed to determine whether prior administration of probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria would prevent disease and change gut flora in an animal model of colitis. METHODS: Swiss albino mice received a probiotic mixture (four Lactobacillus and four Bifidobacterium species) or medium (control) for a week prior to induction of colitis by oral 4% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) for seven days. Appropriate non-colitis controls were used. Histological damage was assessed (n = 5 per group), as was expression of mRNA for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interferon (IFN)-gamma, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 and SOCS-1 in the colonic mucosa (n = 6 per group). Secretion of TNF-alpha was measured in distal colon organ culture (n = 5-6 per group). Levels of Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus acidophilus in feces were quantified by real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting 16S rDNA. RESULTS: Compared to untreated DSS colitis, probiotic treatment significantly reduced weight loss (P < 0.05), shifted histological damage to lesser grades of severity (P < 0.001), reduced mRNA expression of TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 (P < 0.05), and down-regulated production of TNF-alpha from distal colon explants (P < 0.05). Colitis induced a significant reduction in the relative proportions of Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides and Lactobacillus acidophilus group bacteria in feces, and these levels were significantly increased in probiotic-treated mice compared to DSS mice (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Prior administration of probiotic bacteria reduced mucosal inflammation and damage in DSS-induced colitis. DSS colitis was associated with significant changes in the fecal anaerobic bacterial flora and these changes were modulated by administration of probiotic bacteria.
TI  - Probiotics regulate the expression of COX-2 in intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  - Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX) 2 promotes intestinal wound healing but elicits also proinflammatory effects and has been implicated in colorectal carcinogenesis. Thus, a balanced expression of COX-2 is essential for intestinal homeostasis. This study was designed to evaluate the regulation of COX-2 by probiotic organisms and to characterize ligands and receptors involved. Colo320 and SW480 intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) were stimulated with gastrin or TNF-alpha and pre- or coincubated with commensales, bacterial supernatants, or distinct toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. COX-2 promoter activity was determined by luciferase assays, protein expression by Western blotting, and secretion of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) by ELISA. Commensales differentially regulated COX-2 expression in IEC. E. coli Nissle 1917, the probiotic mixture VSL#3, and media conditioned by these organisms ameliorated induced COX-2 expression and PGE(2) secretion. Heat inactivation and DNase treatment significantly decreased these regulatory capacities. Lactobacillus acidophilus, however, significantly increased COX-2 expression and PGE(2) secretion. TLR agonists differentially ameliorated basal or induced COX-2 expression. Distinct probiotics specifically and significantly decrease induced COX-2 expression in IEC, most likely mediated by released factors and in part by bacterial DNA. A significant involvement of TLRs in these regulatory processes remains to be established.
TI  - Storage stability of freeze-dried Lactobacillus acidophilus (La-5) in relation to water activity and presence of oxygen and ascorbate.
AB  - Storage stability of freeze-dried Lactobacillus acidophilus was found to depend on water activity (0.11-0.43), oxygen level (atmospheric oxygen level and <4% oxygen compared) and presence of sodium ascorbate (0% and 10% (w/w)). Increasing water activities decreased bacterial survival, and a reduced oxygen level (<4% oxygen) improved the storage stability, which strongly indicates a connection between oxidative reactions and bacterial instability. The detrimental effect of atmospheric oxygen was reduced by including ascorbate in the freeze drying medium. However, when ascorbate was present a pink/red colour was observed on the surface of the dried samples increasing with the water activity and oxygen level. Increased water activity lead to increased browning also for samples without ascorbate. Free radicals were detected in the dried bacteria by ESR spectroscopy (broad single-peak ESR spectra), where the shape and the g-value was found to depend on the presence of ascorbate and the extent of browning. For increasing water activities the content of radicals increased to a certain level, after which it levelled off and/or decreased. The highest concentrations of radicals were detected in the dried bacteria with highest survival for a given water activity, i.e. low oxygen level and presence of ascorbate, pointing towards a role of semi-stable ascorbyl radicals as a "dead end" for otherwise detrimental free radical reactions.
TI  - Effects of gram-positive microorganisms and their products on in vivo survival of hemopoietic clonogenic cells.
AB  - The effects of gram-positive bacterial strains (Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus rhamnosus) and their subcellular components on the survival of hemopoietic clonogenic cells were evaluated by the formation of endogenous splenic colonies. The effects of these preparations on NO production were studied by the spin-trap paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Bacterial preparations from gram-positive bacteria stimulated survival of hemopoietic clonogenic cells, but did not induce NO production in contrast to E. coli LPS.
TI  - In vitro anti-adhesive activity of green tea extract against pathogen adhesion.
AB  - Camellia sinensis polysaccharide has been reported to possess anti-adhesive activity against pathogens. The present study was designed to investigate whether hot water extracts obtained from green tea leaves might inhibit pathogen adhesion to human or mouse cell lines. Green tea extract-4 (CSI-4) with the maximum yield of 4% (w/v) is composed of a major proportion of carbohydrates containing 40% uronic acids, but lack of catechins. It showed strong inhibitory activities against hemagglutination mediated by pathogens Helicobacter pylori, Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus aureus with the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 0.01-0.5 mg/mL. CSI-4 further demonstrated an inhibitory effect on the adhesion of these pathogens to host cell lines with the IC(50) values (50% inhibition of adhesion) of 0.14-2.3 mg/mL. It exhibited the highest activity against P. acnes, but no inhibitory effects were observed against Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Escherichia coli, or Staphylococcus epidermidis. Our results suggest that CSI-4 may exert a selective anti-adhesive effect against certain pathogenic bacteria with no adverse effects against beneficial or commensal bacteria.
TI  - Effects of polydextrose supplementation on different faecal parameters in healthy volunteers.
AB  - The beneficial effects of prebiotics on bowel health were thoroughly investigated. The aim of the study was to show prebiotic effects of polydextrose (PDX). A placebo-controlled, randomized intervention study with PDX supplementation (8 g/day) was conducted in 45 healthy subjects. The effects of PDX on stool weight, orofaecal transit time, consistency of stool (Bristol stool form scale), short-chain fatty acid production, pH value, neutral sterol and bile acid excretion and faecal microbiota were evaluated. It was found that supplementation of PDX shortened the orofaecal transit time significantly. Furthermore, ingestion of PDX resulted in a decreased pH value and in significant changes in bile acid and neutral sterol excretion. PDX had no effects on stool weight, concentrations of the main short-chain fatty acids (acetate, propionate) and faecal contents of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria. In conclusion, PDX is able to shorten the orofaecal transit time and to improve stool consistency in subjects suffering from constipation. [corrected]
TI  - Released exopolysaccharide (r-EPS) produced from probiotic bacteria reduce biofilm formation of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.
AB  - Here, we characterized released-exopolysaccharides (r-EPS) from Lactobacillus acidophilus A4 with the goal of identifying natural compounds that represses biofilm formation. In plastic 96-well microplates that contained 1.0 mg/ml of r-EPS, enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) biofilms were dramatically decreased by 87% and 94% on polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) surfaces, respectively. In the presence of r-EPS, neither their growth rate nor their autoinducer-2-like activity was affected on the EHEC O157:H7. Importantly, consistent reduction in biofilm formation was also observed when r-EPS was applied to the continuous-flow chamber models. In addition, we found that adding r-EPS significantly repressed biofilm formation by affecting genes related to curli production (crl, csgA, and csgB) and chemotaxis (cheY) in transcriptome analysis. Furthermore, these r-EPS could prevent biofilm formation by a wide range of Gram-negative and -positive pathogens. This property may lead to the development of novel food-grade adjuncts for microbial biofilm control.
TI  - Identification of probiotic lactobacilli used for animal feeds on the basis of 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence.
AB  - The use of probiotics such as Lactobacillus in animal feeds has gained popularity in recent years. In this study the 16S rRNA gene sequence of L. acidophilus in two commercial agents which have been used in animal feeds, LAB-MOS and Ghenisson 22, was determined. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that the two agents, strain MNFLM01 in LAB-MOS and strain GAL-2 in Ghenisson 22, belonged to L. rhamnosus (a member of the L. casei group) and L. johnsonii (a member of the L. acidophilus group), respectively. Biochemical tests assigned the two as L. rhamnosus and ambiguously as L. acidophilus. The data suggest that 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis provides more accurate identification of Lactobacillus species than biochemical tests and would allow quality assurance of relevant commercial products. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of strains MNFLM01 and GAL-2 determined in this study have been submitted to the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession numbers under accession numbers AB288235 and AB295648, respectively.
TI  - Effect of molecules secreted by Lactobacillus acidophilus strain La-5 on Escherichia coli O157:H7 colonization.
AB  - The probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus strain La-5 is a gut-colonizing microorganism that, when established, becomes an important part of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract microbiota. It has been shown to be effective against enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 infection. We have previously shown that molecules released by probiotic strain La-5 influence the transcription of EHEC genes involved in colonization and quorum sensing. In this work, we report on the ability of these molecules to prevent the adherence of EHEC to epithelial cells and on its capacity to concentrate F-actin at adhesion sites. With a fluorescein-labeled phallotoxin, it was shown that La-5 cell-free spent medium (CFSM) fractions remarkably reduced attaching and effacing lesions in HeLa cells. We also observed a significant inhibition of bacterial adhesion to Hep-2 cells when they were treated with the same La-5 CFSM fractions. In order to observe if La-5 CFSM fractions exhibited the same effect in vivo, we studied the ability of luminescent EHEC constructs (LEE1::luxCDABE) to adhere to intestinal epithelial cells of specific-pathogen-free ICR mice following intragastric inoculation. Colonization of the GI tract by luminescent EHEC O157:H7 was monitored in real time with a slow-scan charge-coupled device camera. At the same time, fecal shedding of EHEC was studied. Following oral gavage of the La-5 active fraction, we observed a reduced amount of bioluminescence signal along with a decrease in fecal shedding by mice, indicating an effect on the ability of the organism to colonize the GI tract. Our results confirm past evidence of the possibility of blocking or interfering with EHEC's virulence by active molecules contained in the probiotic CFSM and identify novel therapeutic alternatives to antibiotic treatments in the fight against food-borne pathogens.
TI  - Growth of preschool children was improved when fed an iron-fortified fermented milk beverage supplemented with Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Food fortification is an efficient strategy applied to overcome iron deficiency anemia. This study investigated the effect of iron fortification with probiotic bacteria in a milk beverage on growth and iron status of preschool children with a usually low-bioavailable-iron diet intake. The fermented milk beverage was fortified with iron amino acid chelate (3 mg iron per 80 mL) and supplemented with Lactobacillus acidophilus (test) or not (control). The beverage was fed to 190 children aged 2 to 5 years for a duration of 101 days. Anthropometric, hematologic, and nutritional assessments were carried out before and after the intervention. The levels of red blood cells, hemoglobin, and hematocrit decreased (P < .001) in both groups (test and control) but remained within the reference range. The children fed the probiotic milk beverage exhibited higher red blood cell status and a positive correlation between iron intake and hemoglobin. An increased serum ferritin level was observed in the control group (P < .001). Nutritional status was improved after intervention in both groups by comparing the indices of weight for age and height for age. However, no difference was observed in the weight for height index in these groups. Energy and nutrient intake increased (P < .001) with intervention, and the prevalence of inadequacy was reduced. The fortified beverage contributed to improved nutrient intake and nutritional status of the preschool children. The higher demand and mobilization of nutrients to offset growth may have contributed to maintain blood parameters at borderline levels.
TI  - Probiotic food supplement reduces stress-induced gastrointestinal symptoms in volunteers: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial.
AB  - Stress plays an important role in the development of symptoms contributing to disease. Stress induces various disorders with gastrointestinal, physical, and psychological symptoms. Probiotics can help regulate or modulate gastrointestinal functions. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of a probiotic preparation (Probio-Stick) on stress-induced symptoms in volunteers. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study was conducted on volunteers with symptoms of stress. Subjects received a probiotic (Probio-Stick; Lallemand SAS, Saint-Simon, France) containing Lactobacillus acidophilus Rosell-52 and Bifidobacterium longum Rosell-175 (3 x 10(9) colony-forming units per sachet stick) or a sensorially identical placebo without probiotics during a 3-week period. The consumption of probiotics significantly reduced 2 stress-induced gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain and nausea/vomiting) for intention-to-treat or per-protocol populations. In contrast, the probiotics did not significantly modify the other physical and psychological symptoms and sleep problems induced by stressful life events for intention-to-treat or per-protocol populations. The results indicate that Probio-Stick can provide a beneficial effect on the gastrointestinal symptoms experienced by individuals affected by chronic stress.
TI  - Bacterial succession in the colon during childhood and adolescence: molecular studies in a southern Indian village.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The colonic bacterial flora, largely anaerobic, is believed to establish and stabilize in the first 2 y of life. OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to determine whether the bacterial flora of the colon undergoes further changes (succession) during childhood and adolescence. DESIGN: This cross-sectional study examined fecal samples from 130 healthy children and adolescents in the age group 2-17 y and from 30 healthy adults (median age: 42 y) residing in a single village in southern India. DNA was extracted and subjected to 16S rDNA-targeted real-time polymerase chain reaction to determine the relative predominance of Bifidobacterium genus, Bacteroides-Prevotella-Porphyromonas group, Lactobacillus acidophilus group, Eubacterium rectale, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. RESULTS: Bifidobacterium species and Bacteroides-Prevotella group were dominant fecal bacteria overall. E. rectale and Lactobacillus species were considerably less abundant. Clear age-related differences emerged, with a steep decline in Bifidobacterium species in adults (P < 0.0001), a steep decline of Lactobacillus species >5 y of age (P < 0.0001), an increase in Bacteroides during late adolescence and in adults (P = 0.0040), an increase in E. rectale during childhood and adolescence followed by a steep decline in adults (P < 0.0001), and a late childhood peak of F. prausnitzii with decline in adolescents and adults (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Changes in the bacterial flora occur during childhood and adolescence characterized by reduction in Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species and an increase in Bacteroides, E rectale, and F. prausnitzii peaked during late childhood in this population.
TI  - Compound-specific nitrogen isotope analysis of D-alanine, L-alanine, and valine:  application of diastereomer separation to delta15N and microbial peptidoglycan studies.
AB  - We have developed an analytical method to determine the compound-specific nitrogen isotope compositions of individual amino acid enantiomers using gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry. A novel derivatization of amino acid diastereomers by optically active (R)-(-)-2-butanol or (S)-(+)-2-butanol offers two advantages for nitrogen isotope analysis. First, chromatographic chiral separation can be achieved without the use of chiral stationary-phase columns. Second, the elution order of these compounds on the chromatogram can be switched by a designated esterification reaction. We applied the method to the compound-specific nitrogen isotope analysis of D- and L-alanine in a peptidoglycan derived from the cell walls of cultured bacteria (Firmicutes and Actinobacteria; Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus staphylolyticus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, and Streptomyces sp.), natural whole bacterial cells (Bacillus subtilis var. natto), (pseudo)-peptidoglycan from archaea (Methanobacterium sp.), and cell wall from eukaryota (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). We observed statistically significant differences in nitrogen isotopic compositions; e.g., delta15N ( per thousand vs air) in Staphylococcus staphylolyticus for d-alanine (19.2 +/- 0.5 per thousand, n = 4) and L-alanine (21.3 +/- 0.8 per thousand, n = 4) and in Bacillus subtilis for D-alanine (6.2 +/- 0.2 per thousand, n = 3) and L-alanine (8.2 +/- 0.4 per thousand, n = 3). These results suggest that enzymatic reaction pathways, including the alanine racemase reaction, produce a nitrogen isotopic difference in amino acid enantiomers, resulting in 15N-depleted D-alanine. This method is expected to facilitate compound-specific nitrogen isotope studies of amino acid stereoisomers.
TI  - Toll-like receptor and innate cytokine responses induced by lactobacilli colonization and human rotavirus infection in gnotobiotic pigs.
AB  - Toll-like receptors (TLR) play an important role in the recognition of microbes by host sentinel cells that leads to the subsequent innate and adaptive immune responses. In this study, we evaluated the patterns of TLR2-, TLR3- and TLR9-expressing antigen presenting cells (APCs) in spleen and blood of gnotobiotic (Gn) pigs after colonization with a mixture of two strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus reuteri or infection with the virulent human rotavirus (HRV) Wa strain. We also assessed the influence of LAB on TLR and serum innate cytokine responses induced by HRV. Distributions of subpopulations of APCs [CD14+/-SWC3+CD11R1- monocytes/macrophages and CD14+/-SWC3+CD11R1+ conventional dendritic cells (cDCs)] were described in our previous report (Zhang, W., Wen, K., Azevedo, M.S., Gonzalez, A.M., Saif, L.J., Li, G., Yousef, A.E., Yuan, L., 2008. Lactic acid bacterial colonization and human rotavirus infection influence distribution and frequencies of monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells in neonatal gnotobiotic pigs. Vet. Immunol. Immunopathol. 121, pp. 222-231). We demonstrated that LAB induced strong TLR2-expressing APC responses in blood and spleen, HRV induced a TLR3 response in spleen, and TLR9 responses were induced by either HRV (in spleen) or LAB (in blood). LAB and HRV have an additive effect on TLR2- and TLR9-expressing APC responses, consistent with the adjuvant effect of LAB. Overall, the frequencies of TLR-expressing CD14+ APCs were higher than CD14- APCs. LAB enhanced the IFN-gamma and IL-4 responses in serum, but it had a suppressive effect on the TLR3- and TLR9-expressing CD14- APC responses in spleen and the serum IFN-alpha response induced by HRV. These results elucidated the systemic TLR2-, TLR3-, and TLR9-expressing monocyte/macrophage and cDC responses after HRV infection, LAB colonization, and the two combined. Our findings facilitate the understanding of the mechanism of LAB's adjuvant effect on rotavirus vaccines and the diverse innate and adaptive immune responses induced by commensal LAB colonization versus rotavirus infection and the interactions between them.
TI  - Prediction of surface exposed proteins in Streptococcus pyogenes, with a potential application to other Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in silico prediction of bacterial surface exposed proteins is of growing interest for the rational development of vaccines and in the study of bacteria-host relationships, whether pathogenic or host beneficial. This interest is driven by the increase in the use of DNA sequencing as a major tool in the early characterization of pathogenic bacteria and, more recently, even of complex ecosystems at the host-environment interface in metagenomics approaches. Current protein localization protocols are not suited to this prediction task as they ignore the potential surface exposition of many membrane-associated proteins. Therefore, we developed a new flow scheme, SurfG+, for the processing of protein sequence data with the particular aim of identification of potentially surface exposed (PSE) proteins from Gram-positive bacteria, which was validated for Streptococcus pyogenes. The results of an exploratory case study on closely related lactobacilli of the acidophilus group suggest that the yogurt bacterium Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus) dedicates a relatively important fraction of its coding capacity to secreted proteins, while the probiotic gastrointestinal (GI) tract bacteria L. johnsonii and L. gasseri appear to encode a larger variety of PSE proteins, that may play a role in the interaction with the host.
TI  - A single residue mutation abolishes attachment of the CBM26 starch-binding domain from Lactobacillus amylovorus alpha-amylase.
AB  - Starch is degraded by amylases that frequently have a modular structure composed  of a catalytic domain and at least one non-catalytic domain that is involved in polysaccharide binding. The C-terminal domain from the Lactobacillus amylovorus alpha-amylase has an unusual architecture composed of five tandem starch-binding domains (SBDs). These domains belong to family 26 in the carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM) classification. It has been reported that members of this family have only one site for starch binding, where aromatic amino acids perform the binding function. In SBDs, fold similarities are better conserved than sequences; nevertheless, it is possible to identify in CBM26 members at least two aromatic residues highly conserved. We attempt to explain polysaccharide recognition for the L. amylovorus alpha-amylase SBD through site-directed mutagenesis of aromatic amino acids. Three amino acids were identified as essential for binding, two tyrosines and one tryptophan. Y18L and Y20L mutations were found to decrease the SBD binding capacity, but unexpectedly, the mutation at W32L led to a total loss of affinity, either with linear or ramified substrates. The critical role of Trp 32 in substrate binding confirms the presence of just one binding site in each alpha-amylase SBD.
TI  - S layer protein A of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM regulates immature dendritic  cell and T cell functions.
AB  - Dendritic cells (DCs) are antigen-presenting cells that play an essential role in mucosal tolerance. They regularly encounter beneficial intestinal bacteria, but the nature of these cellular contacts and the immune responses elicited by the bacteria are not entirely elucidated. Here, we examined the interactions of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and its cell surface compounds with DCs. L. acidophilus NCFM attached to DCs and induced a concentration-dependent production of IL-10, and low IL-12p70. We further demonstrated that the bacterium binds to DC-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), a DC- specific receptor. To identify the DC-SIGN ligand present on the bacterium, we took advantage of a generated array of L. acidophilus NCFM mutants. A knockout mutant of L. acidophilus NCFM lacking the surface (S) layer A protein (SlpA) was significantly reduced in binding to DC-SIGN. This mutant incurred a chromosomal inversion leading to dominant expression of a second S layer protein, SlpB. In the SlpB-dominant strain, the nature of the interaction of this bacterium with DCs changed dramatically. Higher concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-12p70, TNFalpha, and IL-1beta were produced by DCs interacting with the SlpB-dominant strain compared with the parent NCFM strain. Unlike the SlpA-knockout mutant, T cells primed with L. acidophilus NCFM stimulated DCs produced more IL-4. The SlpA-DC-SIGN interaction was further confirmed as purified SlpA protein ligated directly to the DC-SIGN. In conclusion, the major S layer protein, SlpA, of L. acidophilus NCFM is the first probiotic bacterial DC-SIGN ligand identified that is functionally involved in the modulation of DCs and T cells functions.
TI  - Oligosaccharide-mediated inhibition of the adhesion of pathogenic Escherichia coli strains to human gut epithelial cells in vitro.
AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate the ability of pectic oligosaccharides (POS) to inhibit adhesion of three strains of verotoxigenic Escherichia coli, three strains of enteropathogenic E. coli, and one nonclinical strain of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans to human intestinal epithelial cell cultures. Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus gasseri were included for comparison. Attachment was determined in the human HT29 cell line by viable count of adherent bacteria. POS in buffer at pH 7.2 were antiadhesive at a dose of 2.5 mg ml(-1), reducing adhesion of enteropathogenic E. coil and verotoxigenic E. coli strains to less than 30% of control values. Concentrations resulting in 50% inhibition ranged from 0.15 to 0.46 mg ml(-1). L. acidophilus was not significantly affected, but adhesion of L. gasseri was reduced to 29% of the control value. POS reduced the adhesion of D. desulfuricans to 0.33% of the control value. POS also had a protective effect against E. coli verocytotoxins VT1 and VT2 at concentrations of 0.01 and 1 microg ml(-1), respectively.
TI  - An experimental study on ulcerative colitis as a potential target for probiotic therapy by Lactobacillus acidophilus with or without "olsalazine".
AB  - Traditional medical treatments for ulcerative colitis (UC) are still compromised  by its adverse effects and not potent enough to keep in remission for long-term periods. So, new therapies that are targeted at specific disease mechanisms have the potential to provide more effective and safe treatments for ulcerative colitis. Probiotics is recently introduced as a therapy for ulcerative colitis. In the present study, Lactobacillus acidophilus was selected as a probiotic therapy to investigate its effects in oxazolone-induced colitis model in rats that mimics the picture in human. The rats were grouped (8 rats each) as normal control group (Group I), Group II served as untreated oxazolone-induced colitis, Group III oxazolone-induced colitis treated with probiotic L. acidophilus (1x10(7) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL/day oral for 14 days), Group IV oxazolone-induced colitis treated with olsalazine (60 mg/kg/day oral for 14 days), Group V oxazolone-induced colitis treated with probiotic L. acidophilus and olsalazine in the same doses and duration. Disease activity index (DAI) was recorded, serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and intrleukin-6 (IL-6) was assessed as inflammatory markers and the histopathological picture of the colon of each rat was studied. Disease activity index (DAI) showed significant positive correlation with the elevated serum levels of CRP (r=0.741, p<0.05), TNF-alpha (r=0.802, p<0.05) and IL-6 (r=0.801, p<0.05). Treatment with either L. acidophilus (group III) or olsalazine (group IV) resulted in significant reduction in serum levels of CRP, TNF-alpha and IL-6, as well as disease activity index (DAI). Treatment with combination of L. acidophilus and olsalazine (group V) offered more significant reduction in serum levels of CRP, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and disease activity index (DAI) when compared to either group II (untreated group), group III (treated with L. acidophilus) or group IV (treated with olsalazine). So, it was concluded that L. acidophilus probiotic could be recommended as adjuvant therapy in combination with olsalazine to achieve more effective treatment for ulcerative colitis. For application in human, this needs to be verified in further clinical studies.
TI  - Lactobacilli facilitate maintenance of intestinal membrane integrity during Shigella dysenteriae 1 infection in rats.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Lactobacilli are used in various dairy products and fermented foods for their potential health beneficial effects. Recently we reported the protective role of Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus acidophilus during Shigella dysenteriae 1 infection. Nevertheless, investigations on the membrane-stabilizing effect of L. rhamnosus and L. acidophilus have not been done. Hence, the present study evaluated the effect of L. rhamnosus and L. acidophilus on the maintenance of intestinal membrane integrity during S. dysenteriae 1-induced diarrhea in rats. METHODS: Rats were divided into eight groups (n = 6 in each group). Induced rats received single oral dose of S. dysenteriae (12 x 10(8) colony-forming units [cfu]/mL). Treated rats received L. rhamnosus (1 x 10(7)cfu/mL) or L. acidophilus (1 x 10(7)cfu/mL) orally for 4 d, alone or in combination, followed by Shigella administration. At the end of the experimental period, animals were sacrificed and the assay of membrane-bound adenosine triphosphatases (Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, Ca(2+)-ATPase, and total ATPase), immunoblot analysis of tight junctional proteins (claudin-1 and occludin), and transmission electron microscopic studies were performed. RESULTS: Induced rats showed a significant (P < 0.05) reduction in the membrane-bound ATPases and reduced expression of tight junction proteins in the membrane, coupled with their increased expression in the cytosol, indicating membrane damage. Transmission electron microscopic studies correlated with biochemical parameters. Pretreatment with combination of L. rhamnosus and L. acidophilus significantly prevented these changes. CONCLUSION: Lactobacillus rhamnosus and L. acidophilus synergistically offered better protection to the intestinal membrane when compared with individual treatments with these strains during S. dysenteriae 1 infection.
TI  - Kinetics of microbial hydrogenation of free linoleic acid to conjugated linoleic  acids.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the ability of selected probiotic bacterial strains to produce conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and also to estimate the biohydrogenation kinetics of Lactobacillus acidophilus on the production of CLA from free linoleic acid (LA). METHODS AND RESULTS: Six probiotic bacteria, Lact. paracasei, Lact. rhamnosus GG, Lact. acidophilus ADH, and Bifidobacterium longum B6, Lact. brevis, and Lact. casei, were used to examine their ability to convert LA to CLA. LA tolerance was evaluated by addition of different LA concentrations in MRS broth. Lact. acidophilus showed the major tolerant to LA and the greatest CLA-producing ability (36-48 microg ml(-1) of CLA). The rate-controlling steps were k(2) and k(1) for the addition of 1 and 3 mg ml(-1) of LA, respectively. The percentage of CLA conversion was higher in MRS broth supplemented with 1 mg ml(-1) (65%) than 3 mg ml(-1) (26%). CONCLUSION: The results provide useful information and new approach for understanding the biohydrogenation mechanisms of CLA production. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study would help elucidate the pathway from LA to stearic acid (SA), known as biohydrogenation. In addition, the use of selected probiotic bacteria might lead to a significant improvement in food safety.
TI  - Inhibition of growth of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli by nonpathogenic Escherichia coli.
AB  - During routine quality control testing of diagnostic methods for Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) using stool samples spiked with STEC, it was observed that the Shiga toxin could not be detected in 32 out of 82 samples tested. Strains of E. coli isolated from such stool samples were shown to be responsible for this inhibition. One particular isolate, named E. coli 1307, was intensively studied because of its highly effective inhibitory effect; this strain significantly reduced growth and Shiga toxin levels in coculture of several STEC strains regardless of serovar or Shiga toxin type. The probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 inhibited growth and reduced Shiga toxin levels in STEC cultures to an extent similar to E. coli 1307, but commensal E. coli strains and several other known probiotic bacteria (enterococci, Bacillus sp., Lactobacillus acidophilus) showed no, or only small, inhibitory effects. Escherichia coli 1307 lacks obvious fitness factors, such as aerobactin, yersiniabactin, microcins and a polysaccharide capsule, that are considered to promote the growth of pathogenic bacteria. We therefore propose strain E. coli 1307 as a candidate probiotic for use in the prevention and treatment of infections caused by STEC.
TI  - [Initial study on the discrimination of oral microorganisms with a metabonomics method].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish the spectra of metabolites that coued be employed in identification of oral pathogenic bacteria, and try to find a convenient and rapid way to discriminate oral microorganisms. METHODS: Suspensions of Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556 and Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 with same density were preparecd and cultured respectively at improved TPY liquid culture medium. The growth quantity were measured periodically by a turbidimeter. And the growth curves of the inoculated bacteria were completed. The culture solutions in stationary phase of the three bacteria were tested with 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy respectively. The data of 1H-NMR spectroscopy results were analyzed by principal components analysis (PCA). RESULTS: The PCA showed the obvious clustering phenomena and the points of three group differentially centralized to three clusters. Therefore, the NMR-based metabonomics profiles could discriminate the three different kinds of bacteria. CONCLUSION: The metabonomics is a promising new technology for developing to a rapid discrimination method of oral pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Lactulose production from milk concentration permeate using calcium carbonate-based catalysts.
AB  - Milk concentration permeate (MCP), a low-value by-product of ultrafiltration plants and calcium carbonate-based catalysts were used for lactulose production. The results obtained show the effectiveness of oyster shell powder and limestone for lactose isomerisation as a replacement for egg shell powder. With the reaction conditions of 12mg/ml catalyst loading, reflux time of 120min at 96 degrees C, a maximum yield of 18-21% lactulose was achievable at a cost of <50% of original lactose degradation (measured by HPLC). De-proteination of MCP by acidification prior to isomerisation helped lactulose formation in the earlier stages, but did not significantly increase the yield. The resulting lactulose MCP (40 degrees B) incorporated at the rate of 3-4% was effective in enhancing the growth rate and acid production of Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA-5) in probiotic products.
TI  - Effect of different prebiotics on the fermentation kinetics, probiotic survival and fatty acids profiles in nonfat symbiotic fermented milk.
AB  - The simultaneous effects of different binary co-cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium lactis with Streptococcus thermophilus and of different prebiotics on the production of fermented milk were investigated in this paper. In particular, we determined and compared the kinetics of acidification of milk either as such or supplemented with 4% (w/w) maltodextrin, oligofructose and polydextrose, as well as the probiotic survival, chemical composition (pH, lactose, lactic acid and protein contents), fatty acids profile and conjugate linoleic acid (CLA) content of fermented milk after storage at 4 degrees C for 24 h. Fermented milk quality was strongly influenced both by the co-culture composition and the selected prebiotic. Depending on the co-culture, prebiotic addition to milk influenced to different extent kinetic acidification parameters. All probiotic counts were stimulated by oligofructose and polydextrose, and among these B. lactis always exhibited the highest counts in all supplemented milk samples. Polydextrose addition led to the highest post-acidification. Although the contents of the main fatty acids were only barely influenced, the highest amounts of conjugated linoleic acid (38% higher than in the control) were found in milk fermented by S. thermophilus-L. acidophilus co-culture and supplemented with maltodextrin.
TI  - Comparison of the antibacterial activity of different self-etching primers and adhesives.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial effects of different one-step and two-step self-etching primer/adhesives on Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans), Lactobacillus casei (L. casei), and Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus). METHODS AND MATERIALS: The antibacterial effects of Clearfil Protect Bond Primer and Bonding agent; AdheSE Primer and Bonding agent; Adper Prompt L-Pop; Futurabond NR; Clearfil Tri S Bond; and Cervitec (positive control, 1% chlorhexidine varnish) were tested against standard strains of S. mutans, L. Casei, and L. acidophilus using the disk diffusion method. Standard filter paper disks (n=5) impregnated with 20 microL of each material were prepared. After incubation at 37 masculineC for 48 hours in a 5-10% CO2 atmosphere, the diameter of inhibition zones were measured in millimeters. Data were analyzed using one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Duncan's Multiple Range Test was used for pairwise comparison. RESULTS: The size of inhibition zones produced by primer/adhesives varied among the brands. AdheSE Primer: S. mutans (20.6+/-1.51); L. casei (14.8+/-1.78); L. acidophilus (11.4+/-0.54). Adper Prompt L-Pop: S. mutans (19.6+/-1.51); L. casei (13.8+/-1.64); L. acidophilus (13.8+/-1.09). Cervitec: S. mutans (23+/-0.00); L. casei (27+/-0.70); L. acidophilus (22.4+/-0.54). Clearfil Protect Bond Primer: S. mutans (17+/-0.00); L. casei (17.6+/-0.54); L. acidophilus (22.4+/-0.54). Futurabond NR was found effective only against S. mutans (14.6+/-1.67). Of all the materials tested, AdheSE Bonding agent, Clearfil Protect Bond Bonding agent, and Clearfil Tri S Bond exhibited no inhibition zone (-) for all bacteria tested. CONCLUSION: Among the adhesives tested Clearafil Protect Bond Primer based upon monomer methacryloyloxydodecylpyridiniium bromide (MDPB) was found to be the most potent material against L. acidophilus and L. casei. AdheSE Primer and Adper Prompt L-Pop are highly effective against S. mutans. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Compared with other adhesive systems, Clearfil Protect Bond Primer (containing MDPB) showed a high antibacterial effect against all microorganizms tested. Two-step, self-etching primer/adhesive system Clearfil Protect Bond might be a suitable choice under minimally invasive restorations. The recently developed one-step, self-etching system Clearfil Tri S Bond showed no antibacterial effect against microorgazims tested.
TI  - Utilization of monolinolein as a substrate for conjugated linoleic acid production by Bifidobacterium breve LMC 520 of human neonatal origin.
AB  - This study was designed to isolate bifidobacteria from human intestines that efficiently converts monolinolein, a monoglyceride form of linoleic acid, into conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), as well as to optimize culture conditions for improving CLA production during milk fermentation. Among 150 screened neonatal bifidobacteria, Bifidobacterium breve LMC 520 showed the highest CLA-producing ability and was tested with different types of fat substrates at various concentrations to determine the optimal conditions for CLA production. Monolinolein was tested as a substrate for CLA production. The incubation time optimized for CLA production was 24 h, and CLA production was proportionally increased with monolinolein concentration. The incubation of LMC 520 with commercial starter strains caused minimal reduction in CLA production. Our results demonstrate that the CLA-producing ability of B. breve LMC 520 could offer beneficial effects when utilized as a starter culture for the development of functional dairy products.
TI  - Acid production from sugars and sugar alcohols by probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in vitro.
AB  - Some probiotic bacterial strains have been suggested to improve oral health. However, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are associated with the progression of dental caries. The pH fall caused by 14 probiotic and dairy bacterial strains from glucose, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol and xylitol was followed. All strains used glucose, nine lactose and seven sucrose. Six of the lactobacilli caused a small decrease in pH with sorbitol and two with xylitol. None of the bifidobacteria fermented sugar alcohols. As all the strains could be considered acidogenic, more long-term clinical trials are needed before recommendations for oral health purposes can be made.
TI  - Murein hydrolase activity in the surface layer of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC  4356.
AB  - We describe a new enzymatic functionality for the surface layer (S-layer) of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356, namely, an endopeptidase activity against the cell wall of Salmonella enterica serovar Newport, assayed via zymograms and identified by Western blotting. Based on amino acid sequence comparisons, the hydrolase activity was predicted to be located at the C terminus. Subsequent cloning and expression of the C-terminal domain in Bacillus subtilis resulted in the functional verification of the enzymatic activity.
TI  - Early markers of allergic disease in a primary prevention study using probiotics: 2.5-year follow-up phase.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We previously reported that a Lactobacillus acidophilus probiotic strain (LAFTI) L10/LAVRI-A1) given for the first 6 months of life increased the risk of allergen sensitization at 1 year of age. METHODS: To assess the effects on subsequent allergic outcomes, 153 children from the initial prevention cohort (n = 178) were reviewed at 2.5 years of age. Clinical outcomes were assessed in relation to (i) probiotic supplementation; and (ii) immune function previously assessed at 6 months of age. RESULTS: Supplementation with this probiotic did not reduce the risk of dermatitis at 2.5 years (31/74, 42%) compared with that in placebo group (25/76, 34%). There was no significant reduction in any other allergic disease or allergen sensitization. Inhalant sensitization at 2.5 years (n = 29) was associated with higher proportions of circulating CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T-cell populations (P = 0.005) and higher allergen-induced FOXP3 levels (P = 0.003) at 6 months. This was also seen in children with dermatitis. Children with dermatitis at 2.5 years also had significantly lower toll-like receptor 4 lipopolysaccharide responses at 6 months of age (IL-12 P = 0.04, IL-6 P = 0.039) and lower polyclonal (PHA) responses (IFN-gamma P = 0.005, IL-10 P = 0.001, and IL-6 P = 0.001). Children who had previously received the probiotic had fewer gastrointestinal infections in the preceding 18 months (P = 0.023). CONCLUSION: The LAFTI L10 probiotic strain did not have any significant effect on allergy outcomes. Allergic children showed a number of early differences in immune function including altered regulatory T-cell markers and innate immune function.
TI  - Prophylactic probiotics for prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis in very low birth weight newborns.
AB  - Our study showed that enteral administration of prophylactic probiotics in neonatal intensive care setup could significantly reduce morbidity due to necrotising enterocolitis in very low birth weight newborn. It also helps in establishing early full enteral feeding and reduces hospital stay.
TI  - Oral probiotics prevent necrotizing enterocolitis in very low birth weight preterm infants: a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The goal was to investigate the efficacy of orally administered probiotics in preventing necrotizing enterocolitis for very low birth weight preterm infants. METHODS: A prospective, blinded, randomized, multicenter controlled trial was conducted at 7 NICUs in Taiwan, to evaluate the beneficial effects of probiotics in necrotizing enterocolitis among very low birth weight infants (birth weight: <1500 g). Very low birth weight infants who survived to start enteral feeding were eligible and were assigned randomly to 2 groups after parental informed consent was obtained. Infants in the study group were given Bifidobacterium bifidum and Lactobacillus acidophilus, added to breast milk or mixed feeding (breast milk and formula), twice daily for 6 weeks. Infants in the control group were fed with breast milk or mixed feeding. The clinicians caring for the infants were blinded to the group assignment. The primary outcome measurement was death or necrotizing enterocolitis (Bell's stage >or=2). RESULTS: Four hundred thirty-four infants were enrolled, 217 in the study group and 217 in the control group. The incidence of death or necrotizing enterocolitis (stage >or=2) was significantly lower in the study group (4 of 217 infants vs 20 of 217 infants). The incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (stage >or=2) was lower in the study group, compared with the control group (4 of 217 infants vs 14 of 217 infants). No adverse effect, such as sepsis, flatulence, or diarrhea, was noted. CONCLUSION: Probiotics, in the form of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, fed enterally to very low birth weight preterm infants for 6 weeks reduced the incidence of death or necrotizing enterocolitis.
TI  - Identification and characterization of domains responsible for self-assembly and  cell wall binding of the surface layer protein of Lactobacillus brevis ATCC 8287.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus brevis ATCC 8287 is covered by a regular surface (S-) layer consisting of a 435 amino acid protein SlpA. This protein is completely unrelated in sequence to the previously characterized S-layer proteins of Lactobacillus acidophilus group. RESULTS: In this work, the self-assembly and cell wall binding domains of SlpA were characterized. The C-terminal self-assembly domain encompassed residues 179-435 of mature SlpA, as demonstrated by the ability of N-terminally truncated recombinant SlpA to form a periodic structure indistinguishable from that formed by full length SlpA. Furthermore, a trypsin degradation analysis indicated the existence of a protease resistant C-terminal domain of 214 amino acids. By producing a set of C-terminally truncated recombinant SlpA (rSlpA) proteins the cell wall binding region was mapped to the N-terminal part of SlpA, where the first 145 amino acids of mature SlpA alone were sufficient for binding to isolated cell wall fragments of L. brevis ATCC 8287. The binding of full length rSlpA to the cell walls was not affected by the treatment of the walls with 5% trichloroacetic acid (TCA), indicating that cell wall structures other than teichoic acids are involved, a feature not shared by the Lactobacillus acidophilus group S-layer proteins characterized so far. Conserved carbohydrate binding motifs were identified in the positively charged N-terminal regions of six Lactobacillus brevis S-layer proteins. CONCLUSION: This study identifies SlpA as a two-domain protein in which the order of the functional domains is reversed compared to other characterized Lactobacillus S-layer proteins, and emphasizes the diversity of potential cell wall receptors despite similar carbohydrate binding sequence motifs in Lactobacillus S-layer proteins.
TI  - MLPA diagnostics of complex microbial communities: relative quantification of bacterial species in oral biofilms.
AB  - A multitude of molecular methods are currently used for identification and characterization of oral biofilms or for community profiling. However, multiplex PCR techniques that are able to routinely identify several species in a single assay are not available. Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) identifies up to 45 unique fragments in a single tube PCR. Here we report a novel use of MLPA in the relative quantification of targeted microorganisms in a community of oral microbiota. We designed 9 species specific probes for: Actinomyces gerencseriae, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Candida albicans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Rothia dentocariosa, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis and Veillonella parvula; and genus specific probes for selected oral Streptococci and Lactobacilli based on their 16S rDNA sequences. MLPA analysis of DNA pooled from the strains showed the expected specific MLPA products. Relative quantification of a serial dilution of equimolar DNA showed that as little as 10 pg templates can be detected with clearly discernible signals. Moreover, a 2 to 7% divergence in relative signal ratio of amplified probes observed from normalized peak area values suggests MLPA can be a cheaper alternative to using qPCR for quantification. We observed 2 to 6 fold fluctuations in signal intensities of MLPA products in DNAs isolated from multispecies biofilms grown in various media for various culture times. Furthermore, MLPA analyses of DNA isolated from saliva obtained from different donors gave a varying number and intensity of signals. This clearly shows the usefulness of MLPA in a quantitative description of microbial shifts.
TI  - Obtaining of a symbiotic product based on lactic bacteria, pollen and honey.
AB  - This study presents the evolution of a Lactobacillus plantarum 2s strain and of a Lactobacillus acidophilus 1a strain on media containing pollen and honey. The following parameters were determined: CFU value, lactic acid production, sugar consumption and presentation of the final product. The researches were performed during 72 h, in tightly closed recipients, at a temperature of 37 degrees C, containing various quantities of milled or non-milled pollen (P1: 20 g non-milled pollen, 3 g honey, 5 mL distilled water; P2: 20 g milled pollen, 3 g honey, 5 mL distilled water; P3: 20% non-milled pollen, 3% honey; P4: 20% milled pollen, 3% honey). The media were very well homogenized before inoculation. The inoculation was made only after the medium gained a homogenous consistency. The inoculum consists of a 48 h culture of Lactobacillus plantarum 2s and Lactobacillus acidophilus, on LE medium, in equal proportions. The testing of the nutritive value of the symbiotic product was made on wistar rats, males and females, divided into lots of 10 animals each. The animals were administered symbiotic product every day, in their food, in intakes of 2 mg kg(-1) (lot I), 20 mg kg(-1) (lot II) and 200 mg kg(-1) (lot III), compared to a control. During the 4 weeks of the experiment, no lethality cases were recorded in any of lots, or in control. The animals involved in the experiment were examined daily and did not present changes of appetite, of behavior or clinical signs of disease.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria prevent alcohol-induced steatohepatitis in rats by acting on the pathways of alcohol metabolism.
AB  - The objective is to study the possible mechanism by which lactic acid bacteria (LAB) prevent alcohol-induced steatohepatitis in rats. A total of 25 Wistar rats were divided into three groups: a LAB-fed group, an alcohol-treated group and a control group. Both the LAB-fed group and the alcohol-treated group received alcohol (10 g kg(-1) per day) orally for up to 5 days (125 h). Before exposure to alcohol, the LAB-fed group were first treated daily with 1.5 ml/100 g of a mixture comprising 4 x 10(10) ml(-1) of Lactobacillus acidophilus and 2.5 x 10(7) ml(-1) of Bifidobacterium longum, while the control group was treated with normal saline only. Biochemical data, alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity and histology of the liver and stomach were evaluated. The ADH activity in the LAB mixture was 3.52 +/- 0.45 mumol mg(-1) protein (10(9) CFU ml(-1)), and was dose-dependent. By 30 min after taking alcohol, serum alcohol concentrations were 514.24 +/- 80.21 microg ml(-1) in the LAB-fed group and 795.15 +/- 203.45 microg ml(-1) in the alcohol-treated group (P < 0.005). Serum alcohol concentrations were reduced by 48% (P < 0.01) in the LAB-fed group, but by only 4% in the alcohol-treated group (P > 0.05) 120 min after oral intake of alcohol. The blood levels of endotoxin, AST and ALT were improved in the LAB-fed group compared to the alcohol-fed group (P < 0.01). All alcohol-treated rats showed moderate to severe steatohepatitis, but the LAB-fed rats showed almost normal histology or very slight lesions only. In conclusion, LAB decreased the alcohol concentration in the blood by increasing the first-pass metabolism in both the stomach and the liver, and effectively protected against alcohol-induced gastric and liver injury. It is interesting to note that the protection was more effective in the liver.
TI  - Selection of aptamers against live bacterial cells.
AB  - Single-stranded DNA or RNA aptamer molecules have usually been selected against purified target molecules. To eliminate the need of purifying target molecules on the cell surface, we have developed a selection technique using live bacterial cells in suspension as targets, to select for ssDNA aptamers specific to cell surface molecules. Lactobacillus acidophilus cells were chosen to demonstrate proof of principle based on their high abundance of surface molecules (potential targets). Aptamer pools obtained after 6-8 rounds of selection demonstrated high affinity for and selective binding with L. acidophilus cells when tested via flow cytometry, microscopy, and fluorescence measurements. Out of 27 aptamers that were cloned and sequenced, one sequence, hemag1P, was found to bind to L. acidophilus much more strongly and specifically than other cells tested. This aptamer was predicted to have a tight hairpin secondary structure. On average, an estimated 164 +/- 47 aptamer molecules were bound to a target cell with an apparent K d of 13 +/- 3 nM. A likely putative molecular target of hemag1P is the S-layer protein on the cell surface.
TI  - Factors affecting the removal of aflatoxin M1 from food model by Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains.
AB  - This paper describes the ability of six dairy strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium to remove aflatoxin M1 (AFM 1) from phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and reconstituted milk. Bacteria were incubated in both PBS and reconstituted milk containing 5, 10 and 20 ng mL(-1) for 0, 4 and 24 h at 37 degrees C. After centrifugation the concentration of AFM 1 was determined in the supernatant fraction using high-performance liquid chromatography. The binding abilities of AFM 1 by viable (10(8) CFU mL(-1)) and heat-killed Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains in PBS ranged from 10.22 to 26.65% and 14.04 to 28.97%, respectively. Similarly, AFM 1-binding capacity in reconstituted milk was found to range from 7.85 to 25.94% and from 12.85 to 27.31% for viable and heat-killed bacteria, respectively within 4 h. While B. bifidum Bb 13 was the best binder, the poorest removal was achieved by L. acidophilus NCC 68. Binding was reversible, and a small proportion of AFM 1 was released back into the solution. The toxin concentration and incubation period had no effect on the removal of AFM 1 by bacteria both in PBS and reconstituted milk.
TI  - Characterization of the amylovorin locus of Lactobacillus amylovorus DCE 471, producer of a bacteriocin active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in combination with colistin and pyocins.
AB  - Lactobacillus amylovorus DCE 471 produces amylovorin L, a bacteriocin with an antibacterial activity against some strains of the Lactobacillus lineage. Based on the sequence of one active peptide, a gene encoding active amylovorin L was cloned and sequenced. Genome walking allowed us to sequence a larger fragment of 7577 bp of genomic DNA, with 12 predicted ORFs. The previously characterized amylovorin L peptide-encoding gene is preceded by another gene encoding a small polypeptide with a typical bacteriocin-processing double-glycine site, suggesting that amylovorin L is a two-component class IIb bacteriocin (amylovorin Lalpha/beta). Lalpha and Lbeta show the highest similarity to gassericin T from Lactobacillus gasseri SBT2055 and BlpN from Streptococcus pneumoniae R6, respectively, and to LafA and LafX, which form the lactacin F bacteriocin of Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC 533. As for other lactic acid bacteria bacteriocins, amylovorin L showed no activity against the Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa on its own, but showed synergistic inhibitory activity when used in combination with the peptide antibiotic colistin, and, remarkably, with the P. aeruginosa soluble bacteriocins, pyocins S1 and S2.
TI  - Effects of a multi-strain probiotic (PrimaLac) on performance and antibody responses to Newcastle disease virus and infectious bursal disease virus vaccination in broiler chickens.
AB  - The effects of the probiotic PrimaLac (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium and Bifidobacterium bifidium) was investigated on performance and immune responses to vaccination against Newcastle disease and infectious bursal disease in broiler chickens. Use of PrimaLac significantly (P<0.05) enhanced broiler performance by improving body weight and decreasing the feed conversion ratio. Although administration of the probiotic appeared to improve the antibody responses to Newcastle disease virus and infectious bursal disease vaccination, the antibody titres of the probiotic-treated group were not significantly different from those not receiving probiotics.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of potential probiotic lactobacilli from pig feces.
AB  - This study examined four lactobacilli isolated from pig feces. Two hundred lactic acid bacteria strains were obtained from pig feces using selective culture media (with vancomycin and bromocresol green; termed LAMVAB agar). Microscopy, the catalase test, Gram-staining, and RAPD-PCR analysis were used to group the bacteria into 20 related clusters. Phenotypic analysis using the API 50 CH test and genotypic analysis of 16S rDNA sequences identified these clusters as representing single strains of each of Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus reuteri. Bacterial survival under the conditions of low pH (2.0) and high concentration (5.0%, w/v) of bile salt was much better than that of the reference strain (Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 33199). The isolated bacteria were quite capable of inhibiting the growth of two pathogens, Escherichia coli K88 and Salmonella typhimurium. The high acid-resistance, bile resistance and antagonism against pathogens, suggest that the four lactic acid bacteria isolated from pig feces could prove useful as piglet probiotics.
TI  - Effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus strain L-55 on the development of atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions in NC/Nga mice.
AB  - In this study, we examined whether Lactobacillus acidophilus strain L-55 (strain  L-55) suppresses the development of atopic dermatitis (AD)-like skin lesions induced by repeated application of 2,4,6-trinitrochlorobenzene (TNCB) in sensitized NC/Nga mice. The effect of strain L-55 was assessed by measuring clinical symptoms, ear swelling, scratching behavior and serum levels of total IgE. Strain L-55 was administered orally once a day: Strain L-55 at doses of 1 and 10 mg cells/mouse inhibited the development of AD-like skin lesions in dermatitis scores for the back. The increase of dermatitis score and ear swelling was also inhibited by strain L-55. In addition, strain L-55 also caused an inhibition of histological changes induced by repeated application of TNCB. Scratching behavior observed in the back and ear was inhibited by strain L-55. Furthermore elevated serum IgE levels observed by TNCB were also decreased by strain L-55. These results indicate that the inhibition of strain L-55 on AD-like lesions induced by repeated application of TNCB in sensitized NC/Nga mice occurred via a decrease in the serum total IgE level.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus LAP5 able to inhibit the Salmonella choleraesuis invasion to the human Caco-2 epithelial cell.
AB  - The mechanisms for lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to inhibit Salmonella invasion appear to be multifactorial and include the adhesion of LAB to host intestine epithelium, the production of organic acids, or bacteriocin by LAB cells. Previously, we found a strain of Lactobacillus acidophilus isolated from swine, i.e. strain LAP5, was with antagonistic effect against Salmonella typhimurium. This strain LAP5 was also found to meet the requirements for probiotic use. In this study, we evaluate the potential of LAP5 strain to protect the human or swine from infection by Salmonella choleraesuis. We present evidence that the culture of LAP5 was able to inhibit the invasion of S. choleraesuis to human Caco-2 cell line. The LAP5 cell culture showed a higher inhibitory effect on the invasion of S. choleraesuis to Caco-2 cells than the spent culture supernatant (SCS) of LAP5 did. Also, the pH, organic acids or the bacteriocin, which act at low pH conditions, may play the role of antagonistic effect. The addition, adhesion of LAP5 cells to Caco-2 cell line may also play roles to reduce the invasion of S. choleraesuis.
TI  - Clinical trial: a multistrain probiotic preparation significantly reduces symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome in a double-blind placebo-controlled study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of probiotics in alleviating the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) appears to be both strain- and dose-related. AIM: To investigate the effect of LAB4, a multistrain probiotic preparation on symptoms of IBS. This probiotic preparation has not previously been assessed in IBS. METHODS: Fifty-two participants with IBS, as defined by the Rome II criteria, participated in this double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Participants were randomized to receive either a probiotic preparation comprising two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus CUL60 (NCIMB 30157) and CUL21 (NCIMB 30156), Bifidobacterium lactis CUL34 (NCIMB 30172) and Bifidobacterium bifidum CUL20 (NCIMB 30153) at a total of 2.5 x 10(10) cfu/capsule or a placebo for 8 weeks. Participants reported their IBS symptoms using a questionnaire fortnightly during the intervention and at 2 weeks post-intervention. RESULTS: A significantly greater improvement in the Symptom Severity Score of IBS and in scores for quality of life, days with pain and satisfaction with bowel habit was observed over the 8-week intervention period in the volunteers receiving the probiotic preparation than in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: LAB4 multistrain probiotic supplement may benefit subjects with IBS.
TI  - Effect of four probiotic strains and Escherichia coli O157:H7 on tight junction integrity and cyclo-oxygenase expression.
AB  - Controversy exists as to whether contact between a probiotic bacterial cell and an epithelial cell in the gut is needed to confer beneficial effects of probiotics, or whether metabolites from probiotics are sufficient to cause this effect. To address this question, Caco-2 cells were treated with cell-free supernatants of four probiotics, Bifidobacterium lactis 420, Bifidobacterium lactis HN019, Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM, Lactobacillus salivarius Ls-33, and by a cell-free supernatant of a pathogenic bacteria, Escherichia coli O157:H7 (EHEC). Tight junction integrity as well as expression of cyclo-oxygenases, which are prostaglandin-producing enzymes, were measured. Probiotic-specific as well as EHEC-specific effects on tight junction integrity and cyclo-oxygenase expression were evident, indicating that live bacterial cells were not necessary for the manifestation of the effects. B. lactis 420 cell-free supernatant increased tight junction integrity, while EHEC cell-free supernatant induced damage on tight junctions. In general, EHEC and probiotics had opposite effects upon cyclo-oxygenase expression. Furthermore, B. lactis 420 cell-free supernatant protected the tight junctions from EHEC-induced damage when administered prior to the cell-free supernatant of EHEC. These results indicate that probiotics produce bioactive metabolites, suggesting that consumption of specific probiotic bacteria might be beneficial in protecting intestinal epithelial cells from the deleterious effects of pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Probiotics in functional gastrointestinal disorders: what are the facts?
AB  - While a rationale for the use of probiotics can be developed for a number of functional gastrointestinal symptoms and syndromes and an experimental basis for their use continues to emerge, the only functional disorder for which an adequate database of clinical trials of probiotics to permit an assessment of clinical efficacy exists is the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBS has also attracted attention, in this regard, because of recent revelations with regard to the potential roles of the enteric flora and immune activation in the pathogenesis of IBS, thereby, leading to a re-awakening of interest in bacteriotherapy in this common and challenging disorder. Some recent randomized controlled studies attest to the efficacy of some probiotics in alleviating individual IBS symptoms while selected strains have a more global impact. Evidence for long-term efficacy is also beginning to emerge though more studies are needed in this regard. Several other issues complicate the interpretation of much of the literature in this area: lack of quality control, use of many different species, and, strains and, above all, significant deficiencies in trial methodology.
TI  - Spermicidal activity of bivittoside D from Bohadschia vitiensis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A recent revelation about increased susceptibility to HIV by use of nonoxynol-9 (N-9) has called for identification of novel molecules with potent sperm-attenuating activity and lower side-effect profile, as suitable alternatives. The present study was designed to investigate spermicidal activity in Bohadschia vitiensis whole-body extracts followed by isolation and characterization of bioactive molecule. METHODS: Bohadschia vitiensis (Semper) was collected from the Southern Andaman coast of India. Freshly collected marine animals were extracted with methanol. A portion of the crude extract was fractionated into four fractions by macerating with hexane, chloroform, and n-butanol successively. All fractions were evaluated for spermicidal activity. Because maximum activity was localized in the n-butanol soluble fraction, it was chromatographed over a silica gel column, and elution with chloroform-methanol-water (35:10:2, v/v) yielded the major compound bivittoside D (400 mg). Bivittoside D [molecular weight (MW) 1426] is a lanostane triterpenoid with six monosaccharide units. The structure of the compound was established on the basis of physicochemical data, acid hydrolysis of saponin, identification of sugar units and aglycon, melting point, and by comparison with data reported in the literature. RESULTS: The aqueous methanol extract of the Bohadschia vitiensis caused 100% mortality of human sperm at 0.01% concentration in vitro, whereas N-9 (reference control) exhibited an equivalent activity at 0.05%. On further fractionation, activity was localized in n-butanol soluble fraction from which the major compound purified was a lanostane triterpenoid called bivittoside D. Bivittoside D was found to be a more potent spermicide (approximately 2.3 times) than N-9 and killed 100% human sperm at the concentration of 350 muM in approximately 20 sec in vitro. Supravital staining and hypoosmotic swelling test revealed sperm membrane permeabilization by bivittoside D as the major mode of spermicidal action. However, bivittoside D was much safer than N-9 towards normal vaginal flora (Lactobacillus) in vitro, although it affected the viability of HeLa cells like other surfactants. CONCLUSION: Bivittoside D from B. vitiensis can adequately replace N-9 in vaginal contraceptives to make them more vaginally safe and ecofriendly.
TI  - Probiotic use in the critically ill.
AB  - Probiotics are "live microbes which when administered in adequate amounts confer  a health benefit to the host" (FAO/WHO joint group). Their potential role in bio-ecological modification of pathological internal milieu of the critically ill is under evaluation. Probiotics are available as single microbial strain (e.g., Bacillus clausii, Lactobacillus) or as a mix of multiple strains of Lactobacillus (acidophilus, sporogenes, lactis, reuteri RC-14, GG, and L. plantarum 299v), Bifidobacterium (bifidum, longum, infantis), Streptococcus (thermophillus, lactis, fecalis), Saccharomyces boulardii etc. Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria are gram-positive, anaerobic, lactic acid bacteria. These are normal inhabitant of human gut and colonize the colon better than others. Critical illness and its treatment create hostile environment in the gut and alters the micro flora favoring growth of pathogens. Therapy with probiotics is an effort to reduce or eliminate potential pathogens and toxins, to release nutrients, antioxidants, growth factors and coagulation factors, to stimulate gut motility and to modulate innate and adaptive immune defense mechanisms via the normalization of altered gut flora. Scientific evidence shows that use of probiotics is effective in prevention and therapy of antibiotic associated diarrhea. However, available probiotics strains in currently used doses do not provide much needed early benefits, and need long-term administration to have clinically beneficial effects (viz, a reduction in rate of infection, severe sepsis, ICU stay, ventilation days and mortality) in critically ill surgical and trauma patients. Possibly, available strains do not adhere to intestinal mucosa early, or may require higher dose than what is used. Gap exists in our knowledge regarding mechanisms of action of different probiotics, most effective strains--single or multiple, cost effectiveness, risk-benefit potential, optimum dose, frequency and duration of treatment etc. More information is needed on safety profile of probiotics in immunocompromised state of the critically ill in view of rare reports of fungemia and sepsis and a trend toward possible increase in nosocomial infection. At present, despite theoretical potential benefits, available evidence is not conclusive to recommend probiotics for routine use in the critically ill.
TI  - Effect of oral probiotics (Bifidobacterium lactis AD011 and Lactobacillus acidophilus AD031) administration on ovalbumin-induced food allergy mouse model.
AB  - Recent study has demonstrated an increasing prevalence of food allergy in Korean  children. Specific probiotic bacteria may promote potentially anti-allergenic processes through induction of Th1-type immunity and enhance the regulatory lymphocyte. This study investigated whether orally administrated probiotics could suppress allergic responses in an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergy mouse model. Thus, female C3H/HeJ mice were orally sensitized with OVA and cholera toxin for 4 weeks. Lactobacillus acidophilus AD031, Bifidobacterium lactis AD011, and L. acidophilus AD031 plus B. lactis AD011 were fed to mice from 2 weeks before the sensitization. The OVA-induced mice that were not treated with probiotics had significantly increased serum levels of OVA-specific IgE and IgG1, and OVA-specific IgA in feces. However, the mice treated with probiotics suppressed production of the OVA-specific IgE, IgG1, and IgA. The level of IL-4 was significantly lower, and the levels of INF-gamma and IL-10 were significantly higher in the mice treated with probiotics than that in the nontreated mice. The groups treated with probiotics had decreased levels of degranulated mast cells, eosinophil granules, and tail scabs. These results indicate that L. acidophilus AD031 and B. lactis AD011 might be useful for the prevention of allergy.
TI  - Biodiversity of the microbial community in a Spanish farmhouse cheese as revealed by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  - The microbial diversity within Alberquilla cheese, made from a spontaneously fermented mixture of raw goats' and sheep's milk in the Alpujarra mountains (Granada, south-east Spain), has been studied by the classical culturing method and also by molecular analysis of community DNA. A collection of 206 isolates was obtained from the cheese on different selective/differential media, which were then re-grouped to 52 after randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR analyses. Isolates on Man-Rogosa and Sharpe-agar (MRS), M17-glucose agar and Kenner Fecal (KF)-agar medium were identified by specific PCR or 16S rRNA gene sequencing and belonged mainly to the lactic-acid bacteria group. The predominant genus was Lactobacillus, which accounted for more than 50% of the isolates, the most abundant species being Lactobacillus paracasei, followed by considerably less quantities of Lb. plantarum and Lb. brevis. Other lactic-acid bacteria identified were Pediococcus urinaequi, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Leuc. mesenteroides, Lactococcus lactis and even the enterococci Enterococcus faecium and E. devriesei. Cluster analyses of RAPD-PCR patterns revealed a high degree of diversity among the lactobacilli. The Gram-negative bacterial strains belonged mainly to Hafnia alvei species. The microbes occurring in Alberquilla cheese were also studied by PCR temporal temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) of the 16S rRNA V3 region and partial 16S rRNA sequencing of the TTGE bands. The results showed a major presence of lactic-acid bacteria closely related to Lc. lactis, Lb. paracasei, Lb. plantarum, Lb. brevis, Lb. acidophilus and Enterococcus sp. The non-lactic-acid bacterium detected was identified as Escherichia coli. All the Enterococcus strains showed great susceptibility to the most clinically relevant antibiotics, harbouring only the virulence gene efaAfm. On the basis of their antimicrobial activity against Listeria monocytogenes we chose two strains of Ln. mesenteroides that produced mesenterocin B105 and mesenterocin Y105, as revealed by PCR techniques.
TI  - Optimization of growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus FTCC 0291 and evaluation of growth characteristics in soy whey medium: a response surface methodology approach.
AB  - Four strains of probiotics were evaluated for their alpha-galactosidase activity. Lactobacillus acidophilus FTCC 0291 displayed the highest specific alpha-galactosidase activity and was thus selected to be optimized in soy whey medium supplemented with seven nitrogen sources. The first-order model showed that meat extract, vegetable extract, and peptone significantly (P < 0.05) influenced the growth of L. acidophilus. The second-order polynomial regression estimated that maximum growth was obtained from the combination of 7.25% (w/v) meat extract, 4.7% (w/v) vegetable extract, and 6.85% (w/v) peptone. The validation experiment showed that response surface methodology was reliable with a variation of only 1.14% from the actual experimental data. Increased utilization of oligosaccharides and reducing sugars contributed to increased growth of L. acidophilus in the soy whey medium. This was accompanied by increased production of short-chain fatty acids and a decrease in pH.
TI  - Microbial content and antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial isolates from yoghurts.
AB  - A total of 83 dairy products form the Greek market were examined for their bacterial populations and results were compared with the label information. The antibiotic susceptibility of the bacterial isolates was also examined. The status labeling of the yoghurts and the dairy desserts was found insufficient. The 89.8% of the cocci was found susceptible against all the 12 antibiotics examined. Lactobacillus spp. strains exhibited some kind of resistance to one or more antibiotics. The isolates of Lactobacillus delbrueckii showed resistance to one to four antibiotics, the isolates of Lactobacillus acidophilus were resistant to one to three antibiotics, while the Lactobacillus paracasei strains were resistant to four or five antibiotics. Finally, multi-resistant strains (six to nine antibiotics) were found only among the Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains.
TI  - Functional genomics of probiotic Lactobacilli.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been used in fermentation processes for millennia. Recent applications such as the use of living cultures as probiotics have significantly increased industrial interest. Related bacterial strains can differ significantly in their genotype and phenotype, and features from one bacterial strain or species cannot necessarily be applied to a related one. These strain or family-specific differences often represent unique and applicable traits. Since 2002, the complete genomes of 13 probiotic LABs have been published. The presentation will discuss these genomes and highlight probiotic traits that are predicted, or functionally linked to genetic content. We have conducted a comparative genomic analysis of 4 completely sequenced Lactobacillus strains versus 25 lactic acid bacterial genomes present in the public database at the time of analysis. Using Differential Blast Analysis, each genome is compared with 3 other Lactobacillus and 25 other LAB genomes. Differential Blast Analysis highlighted strain-specific genes that were not represented in any other LAB used in this analysis and also identified group-specific genes shared within lactobacilli. Lactobacillus-specific genes include mucus-binding proteins involved in cell-adhesion and several transport systems for carbohydrates and amino acids. Comparative genomic analysis has identified gene targets in Lactobacillus acidophilus for functional analysis, including adhesion to mucin and intestinal epithelial cells, acid tolerance, bile tolerance, and quorum sensing. Whole genome transcriptional profiling of L. acidophilus, and isogenic mutants thereof, has revealed the impact of varying conditions (pH, bile, carbohydrates) and food matrices on the expression of genes important to probiotic-linked mechanisms.
TI  - Strong antibacterial effect of miswak against oral microorganisms associated with periodontitis and caries.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The chewing stick (miswak) is used for oral hygiene in many parts of  the world. In addition to the mechanical removal of plaque, an antibacterial effect has been postulated; however, tests of miswak extract from Salvadora persica (Arak) disclosed only low to moderate antibacterial effects. This may be attributable to the extraction process. Our aim was to test in vitro the antibacterial effect of miswak pieces, without extraction, on bacteria implicated in the etiology of periodontitis and caries. METHODS: Miswak pieces were standardized by size and weight (0.07 and 0.14 g) and tested against Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, and, as a reference, Haemophilus influenzae. The miswak pieces were tested in two ways: embedded in the agar plate or suspended above the agar plate. RESULTS: The inhibitory effect was most pronounced on P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and H. influenzae, less on S. mutans, and least on L. acidophilus. Suspended miswak had comparable or stronger effects than miswak embedded in agar. The 0.14-g suspended miswak exhibited significantly greater inhibition on A. actinomycetemcomitans and H. influenzae than the 0.14-g miswak embedded in agar (P<0.01 and P<0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Miswak embedded in agar or suspended above the agar plate had strong antibacterial effects against all bacteria tested. The antibacterial effect of suspended miswak pieces suggests the presence of volatile active antibacterial compounds.
TI  - Clinical trial: effect of active lactic acid bacteria on mucosal barrier function in patients with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The intestinal permeability is increased in patients with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (D-IBS). AIM: To determine the possible efficacy of lactic acid bacteria on the increased intestinal permeability in D-IBS. METHODS: Treatment was employed for 4 weeks in a randomized single blind placebo controlled study with 30 D-IBS patients. Patients were given either probiotic fermented milk (Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium Longum) or milk beverage containing no bacteria. The clinical symptoms were scored and intestinal permeability was measured by a triple sugar test before and after treatment. RESULTS: Small bowel permeability was measured as the ratio of lactulose and mannitol recovery and colonic permeability was measured as the total mass of sucralose excretion (mg). After probiotics treatment, small bowel permeability decreased significantly from 0.038 (0.024) at baseline to 0.023 (0.020) (P = 0.004), the proportion of patients with increased small bowel permeability was lower than baseline (28.6% vs. 64.3%, P = 0.023). However, colonic permeability improved neither in the probiotics group nor in the placebo group at week 4. Treatment with probiotics significantly decreased the mean global IBS scores compared with the baseline scores (9.62 +/- 1.05 vs. 7.64 +/- 1.24, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Short-term active lactic acid bacteria treatment for D-IBS improved mucosal barrier function.
TI  - Inhibition of Escherichia coli O157:H7 attachment by interactions between lactic  acid bacteria and intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  - The intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) layer of the intestinal tract makes direct contact with a number of microbiota communities, including bacteria known to have deleterious health effects. IECs possess innate protective strategies against pathogenic challenge, which primarily involve the formation of a physicochemical barrier. Intestinal tract mucins are principal components of the mucus layer on epithelial surfaces, and perform a protective function against microbial damage. However, little is currently known regarding the interactions between probiotics/pathogens and epithelial cell mucins. The principal objective of this study was to determine the effects of Lactobacillus on the upregulation of MUC2 mucin and the subsequent inhibition of E. coli O157:H7 attachment to epithelial cells. In the current study, the attachment of E. coli O157:H7 to HT-29 intestinal epithelial cells was inhibited significantly by L. acidophilus A4 and its cell extracts. It is also important to note that the expression of MUC2 mucin was increased as the result of the addition of L. acidophilus A4 cell extracts (10.0 mg/ml), which also induced a significant reduction in the degree to which E. coli O157:H7 attached to epithelial cells. In addition, the mRNA levels of IL-8, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha in HT-29 cells were significantly induced by treatment with L. acidophilus A4 extracts. These results indicate that MUC2 mucin and cytokines are important regulatory factors in the immune systems of the gut, and that selected lactobacilli may be able to induce the upregulation of MUC2 mucin and specific cytokines, thereby inhibiting the attachment of E. coli O157:H7.
TI  - The effects of probiotics on PPI-triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori eradication.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was performed to evaluate whether the addition of probiotics to proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-based triple therapy increases the likelihood of successful Helicobacter pylori eradication. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three hundred and forty-seven H. pylori-infected patients were randomized into a triple-plus-yogurt group (yogurt group, n = 168) or a triple-only group (control group, n = 179). Triple therapy consisted of PPI b.i.d., clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d., and amoxicillin 1 g b.i.d. for 7 days. Yogurt group received triple therapy for 1 week and one bottle of Will yogurt per day for at 3 weeks, starting on the first day of triple therapy. Will yogurt (a Korean brand) contains Lactobacillus acidophilus HY2177, Lactobacillus casei HY2743, Bifidobacterium longum HY8001, and Streptococcus thermophilus B-1. (13)C-urea breath test was performed at least 4 weeks after completion of triple therapy. Eradication rates, compliances, and adverse events were compared. RESULTS: By intention-to treat analysis the H. pylori eradication rates in the yogurt group 79.2% (133 of 168) was similar to that in the control group 72.1% (129 of 179) (p = .124). However, by per-protocol (PP) analysis, the eradication rate in the yogurt group, 87.5% (133 of 152) was higher than that in the control group, 78.7% (129 of 164) (p = .037). Common adverse events were metallic taste (11.8%) and diarrhea (8.6%). The frequency of adverse effects in the yogurt group 41.1% (69/168) were higher than in the control group, 26.3% (47 of 179) (p = .003). However, most adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity, and the severities of adverse effects were similar in both groups (p = .401). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of Will yogurt to triple therapy did not reduce the side-effects of triple therapy. But it increased the H. pylori eradication rate by PP analysis, encouraging more research in this field.
TI  - Biochemistry of PUFA double bond isomerases producing conjugated linoleic acid.
AB  - The biotransformation of linoleic acid (LA) into conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) by microorganisms is a potentially useful industrial process. In most cases, however, the identities of proteins involved and the details of enzymatic activity regulation are far from clear. Here we summarize available data on the reaction mechanisms of CLA-producing enzymes characterized until now, from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Ptilota filicina, and Propionibacterium acnes. A general feature of enzymatic LA isomerization is the protein-assisted abstraction of an aliphatic hydrogen atom from position C-11, while the role of flavin as cofactor for the double bond activation in CLA-producing enzymes is also discussed with regard to the recently published three-dimensional structure of an isomerase from P. acnes. Combined data from structural studies, isotopic labeling experiments, and sequence comparison suggest that at least two different prototypical active site geometries occur among polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) double bond isomerases.
TI  - Influence of microencapsulation and spray drying on the viability of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains.
AB  - Improved production methods of starter cultures, which constitute the most important element of probiotic preparations, were investigated. The aim of the presented research was to analyse changes in the viability of Lactobacillus. acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum after stabilization (spray drying, liophilization, fluidization drying) and storage in refrigerated conditions for 4 months. The highest numbers of live cells, up to the fourth month of storage in refrigerated conditions, of the order of 10(7) cfu/g preparation were recorded for the B. bifidum DSM 20239 bacteria in which the N-Tack starch for spray drying was applied. Fluidization drying of encapsulated bacteria allowed obtaining a preparation of the comparable number of live bacterial cells up to the fourth month of storage with those encapsulated bacteria, which were subjected to freeze-drying but the former process was much shorter. The highest survivability of the encapsulated L. acidophilus DSM 20079 and B. bifidum DSM 20239 cells subjected to freeze-drying was obtained using skimmed milk as the cryoprotective substance. Stabilization of bacteria by microencapsulation can give a product easy to store and apply to produce dried food composition.
TI  - Early administration of probiotics alters bacterial colonization and limits diet-induced gut dysfunction and severity of necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm pigs.
AB  - Following preterm birth, bacterial colonization and enteral formula feeding predispose neonates to gut dysfunction and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a serious gastrointestinal inflammatory disease. We hypothesized that administration of probiotics would beneficially influence early bacterial colonization, thereby reducing the susceptibility to formula-induced gut atrophy, dysfunction, and NEC. Caesarean-delivered preterm pigs were provided total parenteral nutrition (1.5 d) followed by enteral feeding (2 d) with porcine colostrum (COLOS; n = 5), formula (FORM; n = 9), or formula with probiotics (FORM-P; Bifidobacterium animalis and Lactobacillus: L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. pentosus, L. plantarum; n = 13). Clinical NEC scores were reduced (P < 0.05) in FORM-P (2.0 +/- 0.2) and COLOS groups (1.7 +/- 0.5) compared with FORM pigs (3.4 +/- 0.6). Lower NEC scores were associated with elevated intestinal weight, mucosa proportion, villus height, RNA integrity, and brush border aminopeptidase A and N activities, and lower gastric organic acid concentration in the FORM-P and COLOS groups (P < 0.05). Diversity of the mucosa-associated bacteria in the distal small intestine was similar among formula-fed pigs, yet the abundance of specific bacterial groups differed between FORM-P and FORM pigs. FORM-P pigs had lower colonization density of a potential pathogen, Clostridium perfringens, and had commensal Lactobacillus bacteria more closely associated with enterocytes along the villus-crypt axis relative to FORM pigs. These results suggest that probiotic administration immediately after birth promotes the colonization of a beneficial commensal microbiota capable of limiting the formula-induced mucosal atrophy, dysfunction, and pathogen load in preterm neonates, thereby reducing the incidence and severity of NEC.
TI  - Antimicrobial photodynamic action on dentin using a light-emitting diode light source.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was the evaluation of two different photosensitizers activated by red light emitted by light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in the decontamination of carious bovine dentin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen bovine incisors were used to obtain dentin samples which were immersed in brain-heart infusion culture medium supplemented with 1% glucose, 2% sucrose, and 1% young primary culture of Lactobacillus acidophilus 10(8) CFU/mL and Streptococcus mutans 10(8) CFU/mL for caries induction. Three different concentrations of the Photogem solution, a hematoporphyrin derivative (1, 2, and 3 mg/mL) and two different concentrations of toluidine blue O (TBO), a basic dye (0.025 and 0.1 mg/mL) were used. To activate the photosensitizers two different light exposure times were used: 60 sec and 120 sec, corresponding respectively to the doses of 24 J/cm(2) and 48 J/cm(2). RESULTS: After counting the numbers of CFU per milligram of carious dentin, we observed that the use of LED energy in association with Photogem or TBO was effective for bacterial reduction in carious dentin, and that the greatest effect on S. mutans and L. acidophilus was obtained with TBO at 0.1 mg/mL and a dose of 48 J/cm(2). It was also observed that the overall toxicity of TBO was higher than that of Photogem, and that the phototoxicity of TBO was higher than that of Photogem. CONCLUSION: Based on our data we propose a mathematical model for the photodynamic effect when different photosensitizer concentrations and light doses are used.
TI  - Probiotic properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from stool samples of longevous people in regions of Hotan, Xinjiang and Bama, Guangxi, China.
AB  - A total of 567 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains were isolated from the stool samples of longevous people in regions of Hotan, Xinjiang and Bama, Guangxi, China. In order to reduce the number of strains for further examinations, 36 isolates were screened out for further examination whilst the other strains, which had lower probiotic properties, were not suitable for yogurt production due to the absence of growth in pH 3.5 MRS medium and no curding during fermentation, and so were excluded. The result of identification by API, sequence analysis of 16S rRNA and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis showed that there were three strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, 10 strains of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, three strains of Lactobacillus casein, three strains of Lactobacillus brevis, two strains of Enterococcus faecium, two strains of Enterococcus faecalis, four strains of Bifdibacterium infantis, three strains of Bifdibacterium brevise, three strains of Bifdibacterium bifidium, two strains of Bifdibacterium adolecentis and one strain of Bifdibacterium longam among the 36 isolates. These strains were evaluated by in vitro methods including survival upon exposure to pH 2.0, 3.0 and/or 0.3% oxgall and adhesion to the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2 as well as antimicrobial activity against potential pathogens. The results presented here show that L. rhamnosus LV108, L. rhamnosus F, B. brevise R39 and B. infantis R42 are acid and bile tolerant, adhere to the cultured human intestinal Caco-2 cell line, antagonistic activity against potential pathogenic bacteria infection in vitro, and so are potential strains for probiotic use.
TI  - Influence of a combination of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and lactitol on healthy elderly: intestinal and immune parameters.
AB  - With increasing age, a number of physiological changes take place which are reflected in immune and bowel function. These changes may relate to the commonly assumed age-related changes in intestinal microbiota; most noticeably a reduction in bifidobacteria. The current study aimed at modifying the intestinal microbiota with a potential synbiotic on selected immune and microbiota markers. Healthy elderly subjects were randomised to consume during 2 weeks either a placebo (sucrose) or a combination of lactitol and Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM twice daily in a double-blind parallel trial. After the intervention, stool frequency was higher in the synbiotic group than in the placebo group and a significant increase in faecal L. acidophilus NCFM levels was observed in the synbiotic group, after baseline correction. In contrast to the generally held opinion, the study subjects had faecal Bifidobacterium levels that were similar to those reported in healthy young adults. These levels were, nevertheless, significantly increased by the intervention. Levels of SCFA were not changed significantly. Of the measured immune markers, PGE2 levels were different between treatments and IgA levels changed over time. These changes were modest which may relate to the fact that the volunteers were healthy. Spermidine levels changed over time which may suggest an improved mucosal integrity and intestinal motility. The results suggest that consumption of lactitol combined with L. acidophilus NCFM twice daily may improve some markers of the intestinal microbiota composition and mucosal functions.
TI  - Estimation of the potential antitumor activity of microencapsulated Lactobacillus acidophilus yogurt formulation in the attenuation of tumorigenesis in Apc(Min/+) mice.
AB  - There is a strong correlation between orally administered probiotics and suppression of the low-grade inflammation that can lead to restoration of normal local immune functions. We studied the potential immunomodulatory and antitumorigenic properties of microencapsulated probiotic bacterial cells in a yogurt formulation in Min mice carrying a germline APC mutation. Daily oral administration of microencapsulated Lactobacillus acidophilus bacterial cells in the yogurt formulation mice resulted in significant suppression of colon tumor incidence, tumor multiplicity, and reduced tumor size. Results show that oral administration of microencapsulated L. acidophilus contributed to the stabilization of animal body weight and decreased the release of bile acids. Histopathological analyses revealed fewer adenomas in treated versus untreated animals. Furthermore, treated animals exhibited fewer gastrointestinal intra-epithelial neoplasias with a lower grade of dysplasia in detected tumors. Results suggest that oral administration of microencapsulated probiotic L. acidophilus exerts anti-tumorous activity, which consequently leads to reduced tumor outcome.
TI  - Therapeutic potential of two probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease as observed in the trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid model of colitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease is thought to be a multifactorial process. One of the leading hypotheses is that an imbalance in normal gut flora induces an excessive immune response and contributes to inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. Administration of probiotic bacteria reduces symptoms in patients suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases, probably via both manipulation of the microflora and stimulation of the intestinal immune system. In the current study the therapeutic potential of two different probiotics-Lactobacillus GG and a mixture of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium longum (YO-MIX Y 109 FRO 1000)--in a rat model of colitis were evaluated. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were administered probiotics for three days simultaneously with colitis induction. Colonic damage was evaluated histologically and biochemically and colonic tissues, as well as fecal samples, were used for bacterial studies using 16S rRNA gene primers. RESULTS: Probiotics administration reduced the relative amounts of the pathogenic bacteria Aeromonas and Escherichia coli in the colonic tissue. However, whereas both probiotics affected colon morphology, only Lactobacillus GG administration reduced myeloperoxidase activity. CONCLUSIONS: We report the therapeutic rather than preventive potential of two different probiotics in an animal model of colitis.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus 74-2 and butyrate induce cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 expression in gastric cancer cells.
AB  - Cyclo-oxygenase (COX) profile predicts prognosis of gastric cancer; COX-2 positive tumors are more often aggressive, and COX-2 suppression is protective against gastric cancer. In contrast, COX-1 suppression is harmful to the intestinal mucosa. The COX-1, COX-2, and COX-1ir expression profiles were measured with real-time PCR in primary (AGS) and metastatic (NCI-N87) gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines treated with butyrate, hyperosmolar medium, and, in the case of NCI-N87, cell-free supernatants of probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus 74-2 and Bifidobacterium lactis 420. The cell lines showed differences in the profile when treated with either hyperosmolar medium or butyrate. In NCI-N87 COX-2 expression was higher but only COX-1 expression was significantly upregulated by butyrate. Similarly to butyrate, the cell-free supernatant of L. acidophilus 74-2 upregulated COX-1, while COX-2 expression remained unchanged. COX-1ir, including COX-3, was upregulated by probiotics and osmotic stress. In conclusion, consumption of L. acidophilus 74-2 could be beneficial for the expression of cytoprotective COX-1.
TI  - Antibacterial action of selenium-enriched probiotics against pathogenic Escherichia coli.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory activity of selenium-enriched probiotics against pathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) in vitro and in vivo. Escherichia coli was co-cultured in vitro with each probiotic strain individually, and a mixture of the four strains and its population was counted at various time points. We also collected a cell-free culture supernatant (CFCS) of each probiotic strain and the four-strain mix to examine their antibacterial activity, using the cylinder plate method. Results demonstrated that co-culture with probiotics significantly reduced the number of E. coli. The different sizes of the inhibition zones made by each CFCS proved that E. coli was inhibited by the metabolites of the probiotics. In vivo, Kunming mice were allocated to different groups supplemented with selenium-enriched and other probiotics. After 28 days, the mice were inoculated with pathogenic E. coli so that we could compare mortality rates and inspect other indexes of each treatment. The mortality of the group with selenium-enriched probiotics was the lowest. In addition, the organic antioxidant status improved, immunity was fortified, and the internal environment of the intestinal tract was enhanced with selenium-enriched probiotic supplementation. In conclusion, selenium-enriched probiotics can strongly antagonize pathogenic E. coli in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of neuropeptides against a range of micro-organisms from skin, oral, respiratory and gastrointestinal tract sites.
AB  - Many neuropeptides are similar in size, amino acid composition and charge to antimicrobial peptides. This study aimed to determine whether the neuropeptides substance P (SP), neurokinin A (NKA), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), displayed antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. SP, NPY, VIP and CGRP displayed variable degrees of antimicrobial activity against all the pathogens tested with the exception of S. aureus. These antimicrobial activities add a further dimension to the immunomodulatory roles for neuropeptides in the inflammatory and immune responses.
TI  - [Indication and identification of Lactobacillus spp. with the use of polymerase chain reaction].
AB  - AIM: The aim of the work is the development of laboratory test for indication and identification of Lactobacillus spp. by the polymerase chain reaction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The work is developed on the base of the GenBank/EMBL data about genetic sequences of the Lactobacillus spp. The sequences of DNA were studied with the help of the ClustalW program. The strains of the Lactobacillus spp., which are the object of the research, have been registered in Russian collection of industrial microorganisms. RESULTS: The laboratory test of nested-PCR for indication and identification L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. acidophilus, L. delbrueckii, L. casei, L. rhamnosus was performed. The specificity of the nested-PCR was correlated with the control analyses of monoculture Lactobacillus spp. and commercial products. CONCLUSION: The new developed laboratory nested-PCR test may be use in control system of milk foods enriched by probiotic microorganisms.
TI  - [Dysbiotic manifestations during eradication therapy of Helicobacter pylori and their corrections].
AB  - Forty-eight patients with duodenal peptic ulcer disease infected with Helicobacter pylori were examined. All patients undergo conventional 1-week eradication therapy. After its ending the patients were randomized to two groups: those who will be treated by synbiotics or control group. Normoflorin B and Normoflorin L, which contain bifidobacteria or lactobacilli in complex with different microelements, vitamins, aminoacids, organic acids, and antioxidants, were used as synbiotics. Morphologic study of biopsy samples of small intestine mucosa were performed in patients from both groups. It was determined that eradication therapy worsened existing symptoms of dyspepsia in 80.9% of cases or lead to their emergence, connected with dysbiotic manifestations, in 55.5% of patients. Inclusion of synbiotics in complex therapy resulted in rapid and effective elimination of dyspeptic symptoms, promoted recovery of affected morphologic and functional states of small intestine mucosal epithelium, and optimized metabolic processes important for the digestion.
TI  - Identification of Lactobacillus UFV H2B20 (probiotic strain) using DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - Sequence analyses of the 16S rDNA gene and DNA-DNA hybridization tests were performed for identification of the species of the probiotic Lactobacillus UFV H2b20 strain. Using these two tests, we concluded that this strain, originally considered Lact. acidophilus, should be classified as Lact. delbrueckii.
TI  - Can different chlorhexidine agents be used as cavity disinfectants?
AB  - This study used the agar well method to compare the antimicrobial effect of cavity disinfectants containing chlorhexidine with other chlorhexidine agents (such as mouthrinses and antiseptics) and to determine whether there was a difference in composite bond strength when these chlorhexidine agents were applied to the dentin surface. All tested solutions showed antimicrobial effect against Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Candida albicans (p < 0.05). However, Savlex was found to be the most effective antibacterial agent against all microorganisms (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the bond strengths obtained from the cavity disinfectants and those of the control group (p > 0.05). However, the mouthrinse and the antiseptic decreased the shear bond strength compared with the control group (p < 0.05).
TI  - Probiotic Pre-treatment Reduces Gliclazide Permeation (ex vivo) in Healthy Rats but Increases It in Diabetic Rats to the Level Seen in Untreated Healthy Rats.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the influence of probiotic pre-treatment on the permeation of the antidiabetic drug gliclazide in healthy and diabetic rats. METHODS: Wistar rats (age 2-3 months, weight 350 +/- 50 g) were randomly allocated into one of 4 groups (N = 16 each group): healthy control, healthy probiotic, diabetic control, and diabetic probiotic. Probiotics (75 mg/kg, equal quantities of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium lactis, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus) were administered twice a day for three days to the appropriate groups after diabetes had been induced with alloxan i.v. 30 mg/kg. Rats were sacrificed, ileal tissues mounted in Ussing chambers and gliclazide (200 microg/mL) was administered for the measurement of the mucosal to serosal absorption Jss((MtoS)) and serosal to mucosal secretion Jss((StoM)) of gliclazide. RESULTS: Treatment of healthy rats with probiotics reduced Jss((MtoS)) of gliclazide from 1.2 +/- 0.3 to 0.3 +/- 0.1 microg/min/cm(2) (P < 0.01) and increased Jss((StoM))from 0.6 +/- 0.1 to 1.4 +/- 0.3 (P < 0.01) resulting in net secretion while, in diabetic tissues, treatment with probiotics increased both Jss((MtoS)) and Jss((StoM))fluxes of gliclazide to the comparable levels of healthy tissues resulting in net absorption. DISCUSSION: In healthy rats, the reduction in Jss((MtoS)) after probiotics administration could be explained by the production of bacterial metabolites that upregulate the mucosal efflux drug transporters Mrp2 that control gliclazide transport. In diabetic rats, the restored fluxes of gliclazide after probiotic treatment, suggests the normalization of the functionality of the drug transporters resulting in a net absorption. CONCLUSION: Probiotics may alter gliclazide transport across rat ileal tissue studied ex vivo.
TI  - Single bioreactor gastrointestinal tract simulator for study of survival of probiotic bacteria.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to design an in vitro model system to evaluate the probiotic potential of food. A single bioreactor system-gastrointestinal tract simulator (GITS) was chosen for process simulation on account of its considerable simplicity compared to multi-vessel systems used in previous studies. The bioreactor was evaluated by studying the viability of four known probiotic bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5, Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC 533, Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG) as a function of their physiological state. L. acidophilus and L. johnsonii survived in GITS better when introduced at an early stationary or exponential phase compared to being previously stored for 2 weeks at 4 degrees C. These two species were more resistant to bile salts and survived better than L. casei and L. rhamnosus GG. The latter two species gave large losses (up to 6 log) in plate counts independent of growth state due to the bile. However, experiments with some commercial probiotic products containing Lb. GG bacteria showed much better survival compared with model food (modified deMan-Rogosa-Sharpe growth medium), thus demonstrating the influence of the food matrix on the viability of bacteria. The study demonstrated that GITS can be successfully used for evaluation of viability of probiotic bacteria and functionality of probiotic food.
TI  - The probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus stimulates chloride/hydroxyl exchange activity in human intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  - Probiotics are viable nonpathogenic microorganisms that are considered to confer  health benefits to the host. Recent studies indicated that some Lactobacillus species function as probiotics and have been used as alternative treatments for diarrhea, which occurs due to increased secretion, decreased absorption, or both. However, the direct effects of probiotics on intestinal electrolyte absorption are not known. Therefore, we examined the effects of Lactobacillus on luminal chloride/hydroxyl (Cl(-)/OH(-)) exchange activity in human intestinal epithelial cells. Postconfluent Caco-2 cells were treated with the Lactobacillus species Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA), Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, or Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LR) for 3 h at a multiplicity of infection of 50. Cl(-)/OH(-) exchange activity was measured as 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2, 2'-disulfonic acid-sensitive (36)Cl uptake in base-loaded cells. Treatment with live, but not heat-killed, LA and LR significantly increased Cl(-)/OH(-) exchange activity (approximately 50%), whereas other species were ineffective. Similarly, the conditioned medium (supernatant) of live LA increased Cl(-)/OH(-) exchange. The ability of LA or its conditioned culture medium to enhance Cl(-)/OH(-) exchange activity was blocked by PI-3 kinase inhibition but was unaffected by inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinases. Corresponding to the increased Cl(-)/OH(-) exchange activity, LA treatment increased the surface expression of the apical anion exchanger, SLC26A3 [Down Regulated in Adenoma (DRA)]. The increased DRA membrane localization might contribute to the increased Cl(-) absorption by LA. Our results suggest that LA secretes soluble effector molecule(s) into the culture medium that stimulate apical Cl(-)/OH(-) exchange activity via phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase mediated mechanism.
TI  - Dendritic cells from Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes differ from spleen dendritic cells in their response to commensal gut bacteria.
AB  - Commensal gut bacteria have potent effects on the immune system, which are partially mediated by intestinal dendritic cells (DC). Distinct commensals confer different properties to in vitro-generated DC. The aim of the present study was to reveal strain-dependent maturation patterns in primary DC. To this end, we compared the response of mouse Peyer's patch (PP) DC, mesenteric lymph node (MLN) DC and spleen DC to the commensal bacteria, Bifidobacterium longum Q46, Lactobacillus acidophilus X37 and Escherichia coli Nissle 1917. Bacterial maturation of DC occurred independently of tissue origin. Expression of CCR7 and CD103 on the surface of MLN DC, necessary for the induction of gut-homing regulatory T cells, increased with stimulation by Gram-positive commensals. Bacteria-dependent cytokine production (IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-alpha) was similar in spleen and MLN DC, and contaminant cells in these DC preparations produced IFN-gamma in response to L. acidophilus. In contrast, PP DC produced IL-6 only in response to E. coli, little IL-10 and no TNF-alpha, and this low cytokine production was not due to inhibition by IL-10 or TGF-beta. Bifidobacteria downregulate IL-6, TNF-alpha and IL-12 production induced in in vitro-generated DC by L. acidophilus. Similar inhibition was observed in splenic DC, but not in MLN DC. MLN cells responded to bacterial stimulation with higher IFN-gamma production than spleen cells, possibly due to the presence of more responsive natural killer cells. Commensal bacteria therefore play specific roles in the gut immune system distinguishable from the effect they would have if recognized by the systemic immune system.
TI  - [Thoughts on pathogenesis of Helicobacter pylori related gastrosis with splenogastric hygropyrexia syndrome].
AB  - Splenogastric hygropyrexia syndrome, a common syndome in clinical practice, responds well to the therapy of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). In view of the complexity of TCM syndrome formation, proceeding from different aspects such as Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection, expression of inflammatory factors, mucosal protection and change in micro-ecosystem, the authors proposed that Hp infection in gastric mucosa, nuclear factor-kappa B activation, over-expression of heat shock protein 70, and "excessive evil, dyssplenism and confliction between healthy energy and evils" due to disequilibrium between Hp and lactobacillus acidophilus in gastric mucosa and coated tongue may be the important links in the formation of Hp related gastrosis with splenogastric hygropyrexia syndrome.
TI  - Effect of resin adhesive systems on root caries formation in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the capability of different adhesive systems to inhibit in vitro caries formation. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Four materials were tested: Gluma Comfort Bond (GL; Heraeus Kulzer), Gluma Comfort Bond + Desensitizer (GL+; Heraeus Kulzer), iBond (iB; Heraeus Kulzer), and One-up Bond F (OUB; Tokuyama). Bovine roots were ground to obtain flat mesial and distal dentin surfaces. Nail varnish was applied to the entire root surface except for two 10 mm X 2 mm windows on the flattened surfaces. The adhesives were applied to the exposed areas according to the manufacturers' instructions. The roots were incubated at 37 degrees C for 1 week in a suspension of StreptococcuS mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Control groups either received no root surface treatment or were etched with 37% phosphoric acid (without immersion in the bacterial suspension). Specimens were sectioned perpendicular to the long axis of the roots, stained for 24 hours with Rhodamine B, and analyzed with confocal laser microscopy. The data were analyzed by 1-way ANOVA and Fisher's PLSD test at 95% confidence level. RESULTS: Lesions in the OUB, iB, and GL+ groups were significantly shallower than those in the no-treatment group. Acid etching did not produce any measurable lesions. Mean lesion depth in the GL group was similar to that in the no-treatment group. There was no significant difference between mean lesion depths in the GL+, GL, and iB groups. CONCLUSION: Fluoride- and glutaraldehyde-containing adhesive systems might be an aid in root caries prevention.
TI  - Skim milk powder supplementation affects lactose utilization, microbial survival  and biotransformation of isoflavone glycosides to isoflavone aglycones in soymilk by Lactobacillus.
AB  - Four probiotic bacteria, Lactobacillus acidophilus 4461, L. acidophilus 4962, Lactobacillus casei 290 and L. casei 2607, were used for fermentation of soymilk (SM) prepared from soy protein isolate (SPI) supplemented with skim milk powder (SMP) (SSM). Soymilk and reconstituted skim milk (RSM) were used as controls. Lactose utilization in SSM by these probiotic organisms ranged from 14.97 to 18.15mg/ml, compared to 14.12-16.06mg/ml for RSM. The pH in SSM dropped to 4.07-4.29 compared to 6.15-6.36 for SM and 4.10-4.96 for RSM. The microbial viable counts were also significantly enhanced by up to 0.98logCFU/ml by the supplementation of SMP to SM. The biotransformation level of isoflavone glycosides (IG) to isoflavone aglycones (IA) in SSM ranged from 81.4% to 85.1%, which was 13.9-19.0% higher than that for SM, after 24h of incubation. Most of IG in SSM was completely converted to IA, except malonyl glycitin and malonyl genistin. At the end of the incubation, IA comprised up to 76.8% of total isoflavones in SSM.
TI  - Characterization of the cholesterol-reducing activity in a cell-free supernatant  of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 43121.
AB  - This study characterizes the factors responsible for the cholesterol reduction by Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 43121. In addition, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and protein profiling was also used to study the response of ATCC 43121 at the proteome level in the presence of cholesterol. The results show that the cell-free supernatant (CFS) produced by ATCC 43121 in the presence of bile salts could also reduce the cholesterol in the broth, whereas all previous reports have suggested a mechanism by live cells. The active fraction was partially purified by 60% ammonium sulfate precipitation, and subsequent Sephacryl S-100 column chromatography. The molecular weight of the component with cholesterol-reducing activity was estimated to be approximately 12 kDa by SDS-PAGE. These results suggest that the novel protein isolated from CFS may be an important factor in the mechanism for cholesterol reduction by ATCC 43121. In addition, the proteins expressed by ATCC 43121 in the presence of cholesterol micelles were detected by 2-DE, five protein spots with at least a 2.5-fold increase in amounts being identified. The responsible proteins may be involved in the stress-response, translation, and metabolic processes. These results may suggest a new possibility for the mechanism underlying cholesterol reduction by lactic acid bacteria (LAB), differing from the conclusions of previous reports.
TI  - Analysis of the genome sequence of Lactobacillus gasseri ATCC 33323 reveals the molecular basis of an autochthonous intestinal organism.
AB  - This study presents the complete genome sequence of Lactobacillus gasseri ATCC 33323, a neotype strain of human origin and a native species found commonly in the gastrointestinal tracts of neonates and adults. The plasmid-free genome was 1,894,360 bp in size and predicted to encode 1,810 genes. The GC content was 35.3%, similar to the GC content of its closest relatives, L. johnsonii NCC 533 (34%) and L. acidophilus NCFM (34%). Two identical copies of the prophage LgaI (40,086 bp), of the Sfi11-like Siphoviridae phage family, were integrated tandomly in the chromosome. A number of unique features were identified in the genome of L. gasseri that were likely acquired by horizontal gene transfer and may contribute to the survival of this bacterium in its ecological niche. L. gasseri encodes two restriction and modification systems, which may limit bacteriophage infection. L. gasseri also encodes an operon for production of heteropolysaccharides of high complexity. A unique alternative sigma factor was present similar to that of B. caccae ATCC 43185, a bacterial species isolated from human feces. In addition, L. gasseri encoded the highest number of putative mucus-binding proteins (14) among lactobacilli sequenced to date. Selected phenotypic characteristics that were compared between ATCC 33323 and other human L. gasseri strains included carbohydrate fermentation patterns, growth and survival in bile, oxalate degradation, and adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells, in vitro. The results from this study indicated high intraspecies variability from a genome encoding traits important for survival and retention in the gastrointestinal tract.
TI  - Functional characteristics of Lactobacillus spp. from traditional Maasai fermented milk products in Kenya.
AB  - In this study functional characteristics of 23 representative Lactobacillus strains isolated from the Maasai traditional fermented milk 'Kule naoto' were determined. The Lb. acidophilus group strains showed resistance to gastric juice and bile. In addition, some Lb. acidophilus strains expressed bile salt hydrolase activity, and had ability to assimilate cholesterol in vitro. In-vitro adhesion to HT29 MTX cells of up to 70% was recorded. Lb. fermentum strains showed almost 100% survival under simulated stomach acidic conditions and physiological salt concentrations of bile salts, hydrophobicity values were over 80%. Most strains of the Lb. casei and Lb. acidophilus groups showed aggregation abilities of above 50%. Many strains expressed a protective effect against N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine induced DNA damage according to the 'comet assay' and none was virulent. The antibiotic minimum inhibitory concentration of selected strains was established. According to these results, the Lactobacillus spp associated with 'Kule naoto', contain potentially probiotic (functional) strains.
TI  - Probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus enhances the immunogenicity of an oral rotavirus vaccine in gnotobiotic pigs.
AB  - We evaluated virus-specific B and T cell responses induced by the attenuated Wa (P1A[8]G1) human rotavirus (AttHRV) oral 2-dose vaccine with or without Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) colonization in neonatal gnotobiotic (Gn) pigs. The AttHRV vaccinated and LA-fed pigs had a significantly higher magnitude of HRV-specific IFN-gamma producing CD8+ T cell responses in ileum and spleen, IgA and IgG antibody-secreting cell responses in ileum, and serum IgM, IgA and IgG antibody and virus neutralizing antibody titers compared to the AttHRV vaccinated pigs without LA colonization. These findings suggest that L. acidophilus has significant immunopotentiating effects and may be used as a safe oral adjuvant for rotavirus vaccines in neonates.
TI  - Interaction of probiotic Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains with human intestinal epithelial cells: adhesion properties, competition against enteropathogens and modulation of IL-8 production.
AB  - The human intestinal microbiota plays a pivotal role in human nutrition and health by promoting the supply of nutrients, preventing pathogen colonization and shaping and maintaining normal mucosal immunity. The depletion of the individual microbiota can result in a higher susceptibility to enteropathogenic bacteria infection. In order to reduce this risk, the use of food supplements containing probiotic bacteria has been recently addressed. In this paper, we investigate the protective role toward enteropathogen infection of probiotic strains belonging to Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. According to our experimental data, Lactobacillus acidophilus Bar13, L. plantarum Bar10, Bifidobacterium longum Bar33 and B. lactis Bar30 were effective in displacing the enteropathogens Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli H10407 from a Caco-2 cell layer. Moreover, L. acidophilus Bar13 and B. longum Bar33 have been assessed for their immunomodulatory activity on IL-8 production by HT29 cells. Both strains showed the potential to protect enterocytes from an acute inflammatory response. These probiotic strains are potential candidates for the development of new functional foods helpful in counteracting enteropathogen infections.
TI  - Effects of natural cross-linkers on the stability of dentin collagen and the inhibition of root caries in vitro.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of dentin collagen modifications induced by various cross-linkers on the stability of collagen matrix and the inhibition of root caries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The following cross-linkers were tested: 5% glutaraldehyde (GA), 0.5% proanthocyanidin (PA), 0.625% genipin (GE). In the first experiment, cross-linker-treated demineralized human root dentin was digested with bacterial collagenase, centrifuged, and the supernatants were subjected to amino acid analysis to determine collagen content. The residues were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and hydroxyproline analysis. In the second experiment, bovine root surfaces were conditioned with phosphoric acid, treated with the cross-linkers, incubated with Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus for 1 week and the root caries inhibition was evaluated with confocal microscopy. Lastly, the ability of the bacteria to colonize the root surface was evaluated. In this experiment slabs of bovine root were treated with the cross-linkers and incubated in a suspension of S. mutans and L. acidophilus. The slabs were washed, resuspended in water, glucose was added, and the pH measured. RESULTS: While all collagen was digested with collagenase in the control groups, only a small proportion was solubilized in the GA-, PA-, and GE-treated groups. The root caries was significantly inhibited by treatment with PA or GA. Drops in pH in the cross-linker-treated groups were essentially the same as in the untreated group. CONCLUSION: Naturally occurring cross-linkers, especially PA, could be used to modify root dentin collagen to efficiently stabilize collagen and to increase its resistance against caries.
TI  - High-level expression of recombinant beta-galactosidases in Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus sakei using a Sakacin P-based expression system.
AB  - This work presents the cloning and expression of the genes encoding heterodimeric beta-galactosidases from Lactobacillus reuteri L103, Lactobacillus acidophilus R22, Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1, and Lactobacillus sakei Lb790. These enzymes consist of two subunits of approximately 73 and 35 kDa, which are encoded by two overlapping genes, lacL and lacM, respectively. We have cloned these genes into the lactobacillal expression vectors pSIP403 and pSIP409, which are based on the sakacin P operon of L. sakei ( Sorvig et al. Microbiology 2005, 151, 2439- 2449 ), and expressed them in the host strains L. plantarum WCFS1 and L. sakei Lb790. Results varied considerably, ranging from 2.23 to 61.1 U/mg of beta-galactosidase activity, depending on the origin of the lacLM genes, the host strain, and the expression vector used. Highest expression levels were obtained in a laboratory cultivation of L. plantarum WCFS1 harboring the plasmid pEH3R containing the lacLM gene from L. reuteri L103. These cultivations yielded approximately 23 000 U of beta-galactosidase activity per liter, corresponding to the formation of roughly 100 mg of recombinant protein per liter of fermentation medium, and beta-galactosidase levels amounted to 55% of the total intracellular protein of the host organism. To further verify the suitability of this expression system, recombinant beta-galactosidase from L. reuteri was purified to apparent homogeneity. The properties of the purified enzyme were essentially identical with the properties of purified native beta-galactosidase from L. reuteri L103. The presented results lead the way to efficient overproduction of beta-galactosidase in a food-grade expression system, which is of high interest for applications in food industry.

TI  - Molecular studies of fecal anaerobic commensal bacteria in acute diarrhea in children.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The commensal bacterial flora of the colon may undergo  changes during diarrhea, owing to colonization of the intestine by pathogens and to rapid intestinal transit. This study used molecular methods to determine changes in the composition of selected commensal anaerobic bacteria during and after acute diarrhea in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fecal samples were obtained from 46 children with acute diarrhea in a rural community during an episode of acute diarrhea, immediately after recovery from diarrhea, and 3 months after recovery. DNA was extracted and quantitative polymerase chain reaction using SYBR green and genus- and species-specific primers targeting 16S rDNA were undertaken to quantitate the following groups of bacteria: Bifidobacterium spp., Bifidobacterium longum group, Bacteroides-Prevotella group, Bacteroides fragilis, Lactobacillus acidophilus group, Faecalibacterium prauznitzii, and Eubacterium rectale, relative to amplification of universal bacterial domain 16S rDNA. RESULTS: Bacteria belonging to the Bacteroides-Prevotella-Porphyromonas group, E rectale, L acidophilus, and F prauznitzii groups were low during acute diarrhea compared with their levels after recovery from diarrhea. The pattern was similar in rotavirus diarrhea and nonrotavirus diarrhea. Administration of amylase-resistant maize starch as adjuvant therapy was associated with lower levels of F prauznitzii at the time of recovery but did not lead to other changes in the floral pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Specific classes of fecal bacteria are lower during episodes of acute diarrhea in children than during periods of normal gastrointestinal health, suggesting specific alterations in the flora during diarrhea.
TI  - Detection of Blastocystis from stool samples using real-time PCR.
AB  - We developed a real-time LC PCR assay to detect a 152 bp sequence in an uncharacterized region of the Blastocystis genome. The described assay detected 11 of 11 ATCC strains of Blastocystis from subtypes 1, 3, and 4. Three of three stool samples from Oregon and California military personnel that were negative for Blastocystis by an ova and parasite test as well as a conventional PCR assay were positive for Blastocystis using our real-time LC PCR assay. Diagnosis of Blastocystis infections using this sensitive method, including DNA extraction and real-time PCR, only requires 3 h. The lower limit of detection for Blastocystis in stool using the real-time LC PCR assay was calculated to be 760 cells of Blastocystis per 100 mg of stool, an estimated 760 parasites per reaction. The assay did not cross-react with Ruminococcus hansenii, Anarococcus hydrogenalis, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Fusobacterium prausnitzii, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, or Lactobacillus acidophilus. Because of the ease of use, sensitivity, specificity, and increase in Blastocystis infections in the USA we believe this assay has the potential to be useful as a clinical diagnosis tool of Blastocystis infection.
TI  - Impact of colostomy on intestinal microflora and bacterial translocation in young rats fed with heat-killed Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LB.
AB  - A rat animal model of left colostomy was found to significantly impair the growth curve of rats. Assessment of the intestinal flora showed that colostomy mostly affects the cecal but not colonic microflora. Generally, the number of enterococci was increased in both ileum and cecum; cecal lactobacilli also rose, accounting for a promotion of lactic acid bacteria in colostomised rats. No significant differences between colostomised, laparotomised and control rats could be observed for the translocation of intestinal bacteria to internal organs of rats (i.e. spleen, kidneys, lungs or liver), whatever their diet. Heat-killed Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LB administration (dead probiotic bacteria) tended to exhibit a stimulatory effect on bifidobacteria, probably affecting the culture-medium fermentation substances included in the pharmaceutical product. This effect was abolished by laparotomy and colostomy. A trend towards a probiotic-like effect, not susceptible to colostomy, was also witnessed as counts of lactobacilli tended to increase in both cecum and colon of all animals fed with L. acidophilus LB.
TI  - The influence of Lactobacillus acidophilus-derived surfactants on staphylococcal  adhesion and biofilm formation.
AB  - The ability of surfactants obtained from three Lactobacillus acidophilus strains  to inhibit Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis biofilms was evaluated. Their influence was determined on bacterial initial adhesion, biofilm formation and dispersal using MTT-reduction assay, confocal laser scanning microscopy and image PHLIP analysis. The number of adhering S. aureus and S. epidermidis cells after a 3-h co-incubation with biosurfactants was reduced by 5-56 % in a strain-and dose-dependent manner. S. epidermidis-and, to a lower extent, in S. aureus-biofilm formation was also inhibited in the presence of the tested surfactants. The addition of surfactants to preformed mature biofilms accelerated their dispersal, and changed the parameters of biofilm morphology. The L. acidophilus-derived surfactants inhibit bacterial deposition rate and biofilm development (and also its maturation) without affecting cell growth probably due to the influence on the cell-surface hydrophobicity of staphylococci.
TI  - Oral administration of dahi containing probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei delayed the progression of streptozotocin-induced diabetes in rats.
AB  - In this study, the effect of dahi containing probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus  NCDC14 and Lactobacillus casei NCDC19 (73 x 10(8) cfu/g) on progression of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes in rats (15 g/day/rat) for 28 days was investigated. Feeding of probiotic dahi significantly suppressed the incremental peaks and area under the curve and delayed reduction of insulin secretion during oral glucose tolerance test more than skim milk or control dahi. The feeding of milk products reduced the total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL and VLDL-cholesterol and increased HDL-cholesterol levels (P<0.05). Moreover, probiotic dahi significantly suppressed STZ-induced oxidative damage in pancreatic tissues by inhibiting the lipid peroxidation and formation of nitric oxide, and preserving antioxidant pool such as glutathione content and activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase. The results suggest that the supplementation of probiotic Lb. acidophilus and Lb. casei with dahi cultures increased the efficacy of dahi to suppress STZ-induced diabetes in rats by inhibiting depletion of insulin as well as preserving diabetic dyslipidemia, and inhibiting lipid peroxidation and nitrite formation. This may empower antioxidant system of beta-cells and may slow down the reduction of insulin and elevation of blood glucose levels.
TI  - Variable biotherapeutic effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus isolates on orogastric and systemic candidiasis in immunodeficient mice.
AB  - Two commercially available isolates of Lactobacillus acidophilus (NCFM and LA-1)  were compared for their capacities to protect immunodeficient bg/bg-nu/un and bg/bg-nu/+ mice from candidiasis. L. acidophilus NCFM prolonged survival of adult and neonatal bg/bg-nu/nu mice, inhibited disseminated candidiasis in both mouse strains, suppressed weight loss associated with Candida albicans infection in bg/bg-nu/nu females, but did not decrease the severity or the incidente of orogastric candidiasis in gnotobiotic mice. L. acidophilus LA-1 suppressed numbers of C. albicans in the alimentary tracts of bg/bg-nu/+ mice and reduced the severity of mucosal candidiasis in bg/bg-nu/nuand bg/bg-nu/+ mice; however, L. acidophilus LA-1 did not improve the survival of bg/bg-nu/nu mice after oral challenge (colonization) with C. albicansand it was associated with lethality in gnotobiotic adult female bg/bg-nu/nu mice. These results demonstrate that the two isolates of L. acidophilus differed in their capacity to protect immunodeficient mice from candidiasis.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus strain L-92 induces apoptosis of antigen-stimulated T cells by modulating dendritic cell function.
AB  - Beneficial effects of lactobacilli have been reported for patients with allergic  diseases and intestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. However, it is not fully understood how such bacteria influence the immunologic response. For this purpose, we investigated the effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus strain L-92 (L-92) on antigen-stimulated T cell responses in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, L-92 decreased the proliferation of CD4(+) T cells stimulated with antigen, and also induced apoptosis of antigen-stimulated T cells. On the other hand, interferon (IFN)-gamma secretion from naive T cells was increased while interleukin (IL)-4 secretion was decreased by L-92. Co-culture with L-92 induced apoptosis of differentiated Th1 and Th2 cells. The degree of apoptosis induction was higher in Th2 cells. Moreover, L-92 up-regulated the expression of B7-H1 and down-regulated that of B7-H2 on dendritic cells (DCs), and DCs exposed to L-92 also induced apoptosis of antigen-stimulated T cells. Finally, orally administered L-92 induced apoptosis of OVA-specific TCR Tg T cells. These results indicate that L-92 attenuates the CD4(+) T cell response by inducing DC-mediated apoptosis and that it might exert beneficial effects in patients with diseases resulting from a hyper-response of CD4(+) T cells.
TI  - Effect of probiotic strains Lactobacillus acidophilus LAFTI L10 and Lactobacillus paracasei LAFTI L26 on systemic immune functions and bacterial translocation in mice.
AB  - The immunostimulatory effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus LAFTI L10 and Lactobacillus paracasei LAFTI L26 were evaluated to determine their probiotic properties for functional food applications. Mice were given oral doses of either L. acidophilus L10 or L. paracasei L26 (108 CFU/50 microl/day), and the effects on immune responses and bacterial translocation were assessed after the 14-day feeding trial. The proliferative responses of splenocytes to concanavalin A and lipopolysaccharide were significantly higher in mice fed L. acidophilus. Concanavalin A-induced splenocyte proliferative responses increased significantly in mice fed L. paracasei. Interleukin 10 and interferon gamma production from the splenocytes stimulated with concanavalin A were enhanced in mice fed L. acidophilus or L. paracasei. The phagocytic activity of the peritoneal macrophages was significantly higher in mice fed either L. acidophilus or L. paracasei compared with control mice. In mice fed L. acidophilus or L. paracasei, the bacterial translocation of Lactobacillus spp. and total anaerobes to Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes was modulated compared with that in the control mice. Furthermore, there was no indication of disruption of intestinal mucosal integrity and thus no bacterial translocation to spleen, liver, or blood in mice fed either L. acidophilus or L. paracasei. The results of this study indicate that L. acidophilus and L. paracasei are potential enhancers of systemic immunity and are nonpathogenic, as suggested by their bacterial translocation profiles in healthy mice.
TI  - Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics.
AB  - According to the German definition, probiotics are defined viable microorganisms, sufficient amounts of which reach the intestine in an active state and thus exert positive health effects. Numerous probiotic microorganisms (e.g. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. reuteri, bifidobacteria and certain strains of L. casei or the L. acidophilus-group) are used in probiotic food, particularly fermented milk products, or have been investigated--as well as Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917, certain enterococci (Enterococcus faecium SF68) and the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii--with regard to their medicinal use. Among the numerous purported health benefits attributed to probiotic bacteria, the (transient) modulation of the intestinal microflora of the host and the capacity to interact with the immune system directly or mediated by the autochthonous microflora, are basic mechanisms. They are supported by an increasing number of in vitro and in vivo experiments using conventional and molecular biologic methods. In addition to these, a limited number of randomized, well-controlled human intervention trials have been reported. Well-established probiotic effects are: 1. Prevention and/or reduction of duration and complaints of rotavirus-induced or antibiotic-associated diarrhea as well as alleviation of complaints due to lactose intolerance. 2. Reduction of the concentration of cancer-promoting enzymes and/or putrefactive (bacterial) metabolites in the gut. 3. Prevention and alleviation of unspecific and irregular complaints of the gastrointestinal tracts in healthy people. 4. Beneficial effects on microbial aberrancies, inflammation and other complaints in connection with: inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, Helicobacter pylori infection or bacterial overgrowth. 5. Normalization of passing stool and stool consistency in subjects suffering from obstipation or an irritable colon. 6. Prevention or alleviation of allergies and atopic diseases in infants. 7. Prevention of respiratory tract infections (common cold, influenza) and other infectious diseases as well as treatment of urogenital infections. Insufficient or at most preliminary evidence exists with respect to cancer prevention, a so-called hypocholesterolemic effect, improvement of the mouth flora and caries prevention or prevention or therapy of ischemic heart diseases or amelioration of autoimmune diseases (e.g. arthritis). A prebiotic is "a selectively fermented ingredient that allows specific changes, both in the composition and/or activity in the gastrointestinal microflora that confers benefits upon host well being and health", whereas synergistic combinations of pro- and prebiotics are called synbiotics. Today, only bifidogenic, non-digestible oligosaccharides (particularly inulin, its hydrolysis product oligofructose, and (trans)galactooligosaccharides), fulfill all the criteria for prebiotic classification. They are dietary fibers with a well-established positive impact on the intestinal microflora. Other health effects of prebiotics (prevention of diarrhoea or obstipation, modulation of the metabolism of the intestinal flora, cancer prevention, positive effects on lipid metabolism, stimulation of mineral adsorption and immunomodulatory properties) are indirect, i.e. mediated by the intestinal microflora, and therefore less-well proven. In the last years, successful attempts have been reported to make infant formula more breast milk-like by the addition of fructo- and (primarily) galactooligosaccharides.
TI  - Effects of inulin and oligofructose on the rheological characteristics and probiotic culture survival in low-fat probiotic ice cream.
AB  - The effects of supplementation of oligofructose or inulin on the rheological characteristics and survival of Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 and Bifidobacterium animalis Bb-12 in low-fat ice cream stored at -18 degrees C for 90 d were studied. Addition of oligofructose or inulin to ice cream mix significantly increased apparent viscosity and overrun and developed the melting properties in ice cream during storage (P < 0.05). However, the highest increase in firmness, the lowest change in melting properties, and the longest 1st dripping time were obtained in probiotic ice cream containing inulin (P < 0.05). Some textural properties have also improved especially by the end of storage. Freezing process caused a significant decrease in the viability of Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 and Bifidobacterium animalis Bb-12 (P < 0.05). Oligofructose significantly improved the viability of L. acidophilus La-5 and B. animalis Bb-12 in ice cream mix (P < 0.05). Although the viable numbers for both bacteria decreased throughout the storage, the minimum level of 10(6) CFU/g was maintained for B. animalis Bb-12 in only ice cream with oligofructose during storage.
TI  - Effects of a probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus strain on feed tolerance in dogs with non-specific dietary sensitivity.
AB  - This study investigated the effects of the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus strain DSM 13241 in dogs with non-specific dietary sensitivity (NSS). Six adult German Shorthair Pointers with NSS consecutively received a control dry diet and the same diet supplemented with the probiotic (6 x 10(6) cfu/g) for 12 weeks each, followed by another control period of four weeks. Frequency of defecations, faecal quality and nutrient digestibility were determined. Faeces were cultured for Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia spp., lactobacilli and bifidobacteria and quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) was performed. Feeding the probiotic improved faecal consistency, faecal dry matter and defecation frequency (p < 0.05). Faecal concentrations of culturable lactobacilli and bifidobacteria increased numerically, but not significantly, also the decrease of the numbers of C. perfringens and Escherichia spp. did not reach the level of significance. Results from FISH showed more constant bacterial populations. It can be concluded that L. acidophilus DSM 13241 can stabilise the digestive processes in dogs with NSS.
TI  - Functional properties of selected starter cultures for sour maize bread.
AB  - This paper focuses on the functional properties of maize sour-dough microflora selected and tested for their use as starter cultures for sour maize bread. Lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolated from spontaneously fermented maize dough were selected based on dominance during fermentation and presence at the end of fermentation. Functional properties examined included acidification, leavening and production of some antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting matrix. The organisms previously identified as Lactobacillus plantarum, Lb. brevis, Lb. fermentum, Lb. acidophilus, Pediococcus acidilactici, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Leuconostoc dextranicum and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were used singly and as mixed cultures in the fermentation (fermentation time: 12h at 28+/-2 degrees C) of maize meal (particle size >0.2mm). The pH fell from an initial value of 5.62-3.05 in maize meals fermented with Lb. plantarum; 4.37 in L. dextranicum+S. cerevisiae compared with the value for the control (no starter) of 4.54. Significant differences (P <or =0.05) were observed in values obtained for the functional properties tested when starters were inoculated compared with the control (no starter) except for leavening. Bivariate correlations at 0.01 levels (two-tailed) showed that significant correlations existed among pH and production of antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting meals, the highest correlation being between production of diacetyl and acid (0.694), a positive correlation indicating that production of both antimicrobial compounds increase together with time. Antimicrobial activities of the fermented maize dough were confirmed by their abilities to inhibit the growth of Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Aspergillus flavus from an initial inoculum concentration of 7 log cfu ml(-1)) for test bacteria and zone of inhibition of up to 1.33 cm for aflatoxigenic A. flavus. The findings of this study form a database for further studies on the development of starter cultures for sour maize bread production as an alternative bread specialty.
TI  - Studies on Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus acidophilus, as potential probiotics, on the immune response and resistance of Tilapia nilotica (Oreochromis niloticus) to challenge infections.
AB  - The probiotic activity of two bacteria (Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus acidophilus) was evaluated by its effect on the immune response of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), beside its protective effect against challenge infections. Furthermore, their in-vitro inhibitory activity was evaluated. The in-vitro antimicrobial assay showed that Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus acidophilus inhibited the growth of A. hydrophila. The B. subtilis inhibited the development of P. fluorescens while L. acidophilus inhibited the growth of Strept. iniae. The B. subtilis and L. acidophilus proved harmless when injected in the O. niloticus. The feed, containing a mixture of B. subtilis and L. acidophilus or B. subtilis alone, showed significantly greater numbers of viable cells than feed containing L. acidophilus only after 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks of storage at 4 degrees C and 25 degrees C. The survival rate and the body-weight gain were significantly increased in the fish given B. subtilis and L. acidophilus for one and two months after application. The hematocrit values showed a significant increase in the group that received the mixture of B. subtilis and L. acidophilus compared with the control group. The nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) assay, neutrophil adherence and lysozyme activity, showed a significant increase in all the probiotic-treated groups after 1 and 2 months of feeding, when compared with the untreated control group. The serum bactericidal activity was high in the group that was given a mixture of the two bacteria. The relative level of protection (RLP) was significantly higher against A. hydrophila, in the bacterial mixture treated group and against P. fluorescens in the L. acidophilus treated group, after one month of the feeding trial. A significantly higher RLP, against A. hydrophila or P. fluorescens, was noticed after 2 months of the feeding trial in the group given a mixture of the two bacteria, and against Strept. iniae in the group fed a diet containing L. acidophilus.
TI  - Analysis of bacterial community during the fermentation of pulque, a traditional  Mexican alcoholic beverage, using a polyphasic approach.
AB  - In this study, the characterization of the bacterial community present during the fermentation of pulque, a traditional Mexican alcoholic beverage from maguey (Agave), was determined for the first time by a polyphasic approach in which both culture and non-culture dependent methods were utilized. The work included the isolation of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), aerobic mesophiles, and 16S rDNA clone libraries from total DNA extracted from the maguey sap (aguamiel) used as substrate, after inoculation with a sample of previously produced pulque and followed by 6-h fermentation. Microbiological diversity results were correlated with fermentation process parameters such as sucrose, glucose, fructose and fermentation product concentrations. In addition, medium rheological behavior analysis and scanning electron microscopy in aguamiel and during pulque fermentation were also performed. Our results showed that both culture and non-culture dependent approaches allowed the detection of several new and previously reported species within the alpha-, gamma-Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. Bacteria diversity in aguamiel was composed by the heterofermentative Leuconostoc citreum, L. mesenteroides, L. kimchi, the gamma-Proteobacteria Erwinia rhapontici, Enterobacter spp. and Acinetobacter radioresistens. Inoculation with previously fermented pulque incorporated to the system microbiota, homofermentative lactobacilli related to Lactobacillus acidophilus, several alpha-Proteobacteria such as Zymomonas mobilis and Acetobacter malorum, other gamma-Proteobacteria and an important amount of yeasts, creating a starting metabolic diversity composed by homofermentative and heterofermentative LAB, acetic and ethanol producing microorganisms. At the end of the fermentation process, the bacterial diversity was mainly composed by the homofermentative Lactobacillus acidophilus, the heterofermentative L. mesenteroides, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and the alpha-Proteobacteria A. malorum. After a 6-h fermentation, 83.27% of total sugars detected after inoculation were consumed (228.4 mM hexose equivalents) and a carbon (C) recovery of 66.18% in fermentation products was estimated. They were produced 284.4 mM C as ethanol, 71.5 mM C as acetic acid and 19 mM C as lactic acid, demonstrating the presence of homo- and heterofermentative, acetic and alcoholic metabolisms in the final product. It was also found, after hydrolysis, that the exopolysaccharide produced during the fermentation was mainly composed by fructose residues, probably inulin or levan.
TI  - A differential medium for lactic acid-producing bacteria in a mixed culture.
AB  - AIMS: Modified deMan-Rogosa Sharpe agar containing bromophenol blue (mMRS-BPB) was tested as a medium for counting and differentiation of each lactic acid-producing bacterium (LAB), especially in a mixed culture. METHODS AND RESULTS: Type strains of 10 LAB species (Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. brevis, L. bulgaricus, L. gasseri, L. paracasei, L. plantarum, L. reuteri, Weissella confusa, Bifidobacterium bifidum and B. infantis) and five commercial yogurts were inoculated on plate count agar with bromocresol purple, mMRS, and mMRS-BPB. Each type strain showed more clearly formed colonies on the three media under anaerobic conditions than under aerobic conditions. Especially each type strain produced colonies with specific characteristics of each species on mMRS-BPB. Commercial yogurts produced the largest number of colonies with various shapes and colours on mMRS-BPB. CONCLUSIONS: Modified deMan-Rogosa Sharpe agar containing bromophenol blue under anaerobic conditions is appropriate for counting and differentiating each LAB in a mixed culture. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Modified deMan-Rogosa Sharpe agar containing bromophenol blue will be useful in isolation and enumeration of each LAB from fermented foods as well as intestinal microflora.
TI  - Comparison of broth microdilution, Etest, and agar disk diffusion methods for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Lactobacillus acidophilus group members.
AB  - In recent years, the absence of acquired antimicrobial resistance has become an important criterion to evaluate the biosafety of lactobacilli used as industrial starter or probiotic cultures. At present, however, standards for susceptibility testing of Lactobacillus strains or approved guidelines for interpreting the test results are not available. Hence, this study was carried out to contribute to the establishment of a standardized procedure for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of lactobacilli. The results obtained by testing 104 strains of the Lactobacillus acidophilus group were compared based on broth microdilution, disk diffusion, and Etest. Except for some specific agent-related effects, agreement between MICs resulting from the broth microdilution method and the Etest was good. In addition, inhibition zone diameters determined with disk diffusion correlated well with MICs from Etest and broth microdilution.
TI  - Effects of seven potential probiotic strains on specific immune responses in healthy adults: a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial.
AB  - This pilot study investigated the immunomodulatory properties of seven probiotic  strains. Eighty-three healthy volunteers aged 18-62 years consumed 2 x 10(10) CFU of bacteria or a placebo (maltodextrin) over 3 weeks (D0-D21). Subjects received an oral cholera vaccine at D7 and at D14; blood and saliva samples were collected at D0, D21 and D28. Serum samples were analyzed for specific IgA, IgG and IgM, and saliva samples were analyzed for specific IgA only, by ELISA. Statistical analyses were based on Wilcoxon's signed-rank test (intragroup analyses) and exact median t-test (intergroup analyses). Salivary analysis showed no difference in specific IgA concentrations between groups. Serum analysis indicated an effect of some of the tested strains on specific humoral responses. Between D0 and D21, IgG increased in two probiotic groups, for example, Bifidobacterium lactis Bl-04 and Lactobacillus acidophilus La-14, compared with controls (P=0.01). Trends toward significant changes in immunoglobulin serum concentrations compared with controls (P<0.1) were found for six out of the seven probiotic strains. In conclusion, some strains of probiotics demonstrated a faster immune response measured with serum immunoglobulin indicators, especially IgG, although overall vaccination was not influenced. Specific strains of probiotics may thus act as adjuvants to the humoral immune response following oral vaccination.
TI  - Detection of T lymphocytes in intestine of broiler chicks treated with Lactobacillus spp. and challenged with Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis.
AB  - The expression of immune response in the form of leukocytic infiltrate by CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells in the epithelium and in the intestinal lamina propria of chicks was studied in the present work by means of immunohistochemical reaction. The chicks were treated with Lactobacillus spp. or cecal microflora (CM) and experimentally challenged or not with Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis. The 320 birds utilized were divided into 4 groups containing 80 chicks each and submitted to treatments with Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and CM. Each group was subdivided into 4 subgroups of 20 birds each and classified into a subgroup that did not receive treatment (negative control), subgroup treated, subgroup treated and challenged with Salmonella Enteritidis, and subgroup only challenged with Salmonella Enteritidis (positive control). The results obtained show that the treatment with L. reuteri, L. salivarius, L. acidophilus, or CM and challenged or not with Salmonella Enteritidis determine immune response in the form of leukocytic infiltrate by CD3+ and CD8+ lymphocytes followed by CD4+ in the epithelium and in the lamina propria of the duodenum, jejunum, and cecum of chicks up to 12 d of age. The quantity of CD3+ lymphocytes was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the intestine of chicks treated with L. acidophilus or CM and challenged or not with Salmonella Enteritidis; however, the higher quantity of CD8+ lymphocytes was in the intestine of chicks treated with CM and challenged with Salmonella Enteritidis. The duodenum was the segment in which the immune response by T cells (CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+) was stimulated with the greatest intensity, followed by, respectively, the jejunum and cecum. The quantity of CD3+ lymphocytes present in the duodenum, jejunum, and cecum increases with the age of chicks, independent of the stimulus determined by treatments or challenge.
TI  - Influence of lamb rennet paste containing probiotic on proteolysis and rheological properties of pecorino cheese.
AB  - Pecorino cheeses made from heat-treated ewes' milk using traditional lamb rennet  paste (RP), lamb rennet paste containing Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA-5; RPL), and lamb rennet paste containing a mix of Bifidobacterium lactis (BB-12) and Bifidobacterium longum (BB-46; RPB) were characterized for proteolytic and rheological features during ripening. Consumer acceptance of cheeses at 60 d of ripening was evaluated. Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium mix displayed counts of 8 log(10) cfu/g and 9 log(10) cfu/g, respectively, in cheese during ripening. The RPB cheese displayed a greater degradation of casein (CN) matrix carried out by the enzymes associated to both Bifidobacterium mix and endogenous lactic acid microflora, resulting in the highest values of non-CN N and water-soluble N and the highest amount of alpha(s)-CN degradation products in cheese at 60 d of ripening. The RPL cheese displayed intermediate levels of lactic acid bacteria and of N fractions. The percentage of gamma-CN in RP and RPL cheeses at 60 d was 2-fold higher than in the cheese curd of the same groups, whereas the mentioned parameter was 3-fold higher in RPB cheese than in the corresponding fresh curd according to its highest plasmin content. The lower hardness in RPB at the end of ripening could be ascribed to the greater proteolysis observed in cheese harboring the Bifidobacterium mix. Although differences in proteolytic patterns were found among treatments, there were no differences in smell and taste scores.
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis and Lactobacillus sp in liquid-based cervical samples in healthy and disturbed vaginal flora using cultivation-independent methods.
AB  - Our objective was to determine the morphotype of the adherent bacteria in liquid-based cytology (LBC) in smears with healthy and disturbed vaginal flora. And to use PCR technology on the same fixed cell sample to establish DNA patterns of the 16S RNA genes of the bacteria in the sample. Thirty samples were randomly selected from a large group of cervical cell samples suspended in a commercial coagulant fixative "(BoonFix)." PCR was used to amplify DNA of five bacterial species: Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Mycoplasma hominis. The LBC slides were then analyzed by light microscopy to estimate bacterial adhesion. DNA of lactobacilli was detected in all cell samples. Seventeen smears showed colonization with Gardnerella vaginalis (range 2.6 x 10(2)-3.0 x 10(5) bacteria/mul BoonFix sample). Two cases were identified as dysbacteriotic with high DNA values for Gardnerella vaginalis and low values for Lactobacillus crispatus. The sample with the highest concentration for Gardnerella vaginalis showed an unequivocal Gardnerella infection. This study indicates that the adherence pattern of a disturbed flora in liquid-based cervical samples can be identified unequivocally, and that these samples are suitable for quantitative PCR analysis. This cultivation independent method reveals a strong inverse relationship between Gardnerella vaginalis and Lactobacillus crispatus in dysbacteriosis and unequivocal Gardnerella infection.
TI  - Effects of direct-fed microbial supplementation on digestibility and fermentation end-products in horses fed low- and high-starch concentrates.
AB  - A study was conducted to determine whether direct-fed microbials (DFM) could be used to increase digestibility and minimize the risk of acidosis associated with feeding an increase in the amount of starch fed to horses. Fifteen mature Thoroughbred geldings were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments in a 3 x 3 Latin square design balanced for carryover effects. Within each 26-d period, horses were offered grass hay + low-starch concentrate (LS; 1.2 g of starch x kg of BW(-1) x meal(-1)) from d 1 to 13 and then were abruptly changed to hay + high-starch concentrate (HS; 2.4 g of starch.kg of BW(-1)x meal(-1)) on d 14 continuing through d 26. The DFM treatments were offered in concentrate pellets at a target dosage of 10(8) cfu/(50 kg of BW x d) as follows: no DFM (CON; control), Lactobacillus acidophilus (LAC1; single-species DFM), or a mixture of L. acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Enterococcus faecium (LAC4; multiple-species DFM). Total feces were collected over 72 h from d 11 to 13 (LS; low dietary starch collection), from d 15 to 17 (AC; abrupt change in dietary starch collection), and at the end of each experimental period, from d 24 to 26 (HS; high dietary starch collection). Data collected consisted of total DM intake and fecal output, fecal pH, fecal acetate and propionate concentrations, and viable numbers of DFM in the feed. With the exception of Fe digestibility, there were no starch x DFM interactions. There was an effect of starch level (P <or= 0.02) on most nutrient digestibilities, except for Mg (P = 0.08) and CP, K, and Zn (P > 0.10). Horses supplemented with LAC4 had increased ether extract (P < 0.05) and a tendency for decreased Na (P < 0.10) digestibilities compared with CON horses. All DFM-supplemented horses had increased Cu (P < 0.05) and Fe and numerically increased Zn digestibilities compared with CON horses. Fecal pH decreased (P < 0.05), and fecal propionate concentration increased (P < 0.05) as dietary starch content changed from LS to HS. There was a tendency for elevated fecal pH (P < 0.10) in LAC1 horses compared with CON horses. These results confirm that increasing starch in the equine diet can enhance nutrient digestibility of the diet. Supplementing equine diets with either a single or mixed strain direct-fed lactic acid bacteria had limited effects on nutrient digestibility or on reducing the risk of acidosis associated with feeding high-starch concentrates to horses. The potential response of DFM supplementation should be evaluated when a more acute acidotic state is induced in horses than in the current study.
TI  - Electron microscopic analysis of dairy microbes inactivated by ultrasound.
AB  - Ultrasonication is a non-thermal method of food preservation that has the advantage of inactivating microbes in food without causing the common side-effects associated with conventional heat treatments, such as nutrient and flavour loss. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of ultrasound as an alternative to heat pasteurisation and to assess cell damage using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Three spoilage microbes, previously isolated from pasteurised milk, were used as "test" microbes. Saline solution (SSS) and UHT milk were used as suspension media and were inoculated with exponential growth phase "test" microbes at a microbial concentration of 1 x 10(4) cfu ml(-1). The samples were subjected to power ultrasound (20 kHz, 750 W), at 100%/124 microm wave amplitude for different time intervals. Both Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were reduced by >99% (for both suspension media) after ultrasonication and Lactobacillus acidophilus was reduced by 72% and 84% in SSS and milk, respectively. Transmission electron microscope micrographs showed that ultrasonication inflicts extensive microbicidal/microbistatic external and internal damage on all three "test" microbes. In E. coli, sonication-induced emulsification caused the formation of unique minute lipopolysaccharide vesicles from the fragmenting cell envelope.
TI  - Comparative effect of direct-fed microbials on fecal shedding of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella in naturally infected feedlot cattle.
AB  - The effect of direct-fed microbials (DFM) on fecal shedding of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella in naturally infected feedlot cattle was evaluated in a clinical trial involving 138 feedlot steers. Following standard laboratory methods, fecal samples collected from steers were evaluated for change in the detectable levels of E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella shed in feces after DFM treatment. Sampling of steers was carried out every 3 weeks for 84 days. A significant reduction (32%) in fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7 (P < 0.001), but not Salmonella (P = 0.24), was observed among the treatment steers compared with the control group during finishing. The probability of recovery of E. coli O157:H7 from the feces of treated and control steers was 34.0 and 66.0%, respectively. Steers placed on DFM supplement were almost three times less likely to shed E. coli O157:H7 (odds ratio, 0.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 0.53; P < 0.001) in their feces as opposed to their control counterparts. The probability of recovery of Salmonella from the feces of the control (14.0%) and the treated (11.3%) steers was similar. However, the DFM significantly reduced probability of new infections with Salmonella among DFM-treated cattle compared with controls (nontreated ones). It appears that DFM as applied in our study are capable of significantly reducing fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7 in naturally infected cattle but not Salmonella. The factors responsible for the observed difference in the effects of DFM on E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella warrants further investigation.
TI  - Diversity and dynamics of lactobacilli populations during ripening of RDO Camembert cheese.
AB  - The diversity and dynamics of Lactobacillus populations in traditional raw milk Camembert cheese were monitored throughout the manufacturing process in 3 dairies. Culture-dependent analysis was carried out on isolates grown on acidified de Man - Rogosa - Sharpe agar and Lactobacillus anaerobic de Man Rogosa Sharpe agar supplemented with vancomycin and bromocresol green media. The isolates were identified by polymerase chain reaction - temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-TGGE) and (or) species-specific PCR and (or) sequencing, and Lactobacillus paracasei and Lactobacillus plantarum isolates were characterized by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Milk and cheese were subjected to culture-independent analysis by PCR-TGGE. Presumed lactobacilli were detected by plate counts throughout the ripening process. However, molecular analysis of total DNA and DNA of isolates failed to detect Lactobacillus spp. in certain cases. The dominant species in the 3 dairies was L. paracasei. PFGE analysis revealed 21 different profiles among 39 L. paracasei isolates. Lactobacillus plantarum was the second most isolated species, but it occurred nearly exclusively in one dairy. The other species isolated were Lactobacillus parabuchneri, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, a Lactobacillus psittaci/delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus/gallinarum/crispatus group, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus kefiri, and Lactobacillus perolens. Lactobacilli diversity at the strain level was high. Dynamics varied among dairies, and each cheese exhibited a specific picture of species and strains.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of a bile salt hydrolase from Lactobacillus acidophilus PF01.
AB  - Phenotypic screening for bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity was performed on Lactobacillus acidophilus PF01 isolated from piglet feces. A gene encoding BSH was identified and cloned from the genomic library of L. acidophilus PF01. The bsh gene and surrounding regions were characterized by nucleotide sequence analysis and were found to contain a single open reading frame (ORF) of 951 nucleotides encoding a 316 amino acid protein. The potential bsh promoter region was located upstream of the start codon. The protein deduced from the complete ORF had high similarity with other BSHs, and four amino acid motifs located around the active site, FGRNXD, AGLNF, VLTNXP, and GXGXGXXGXPGD, were highly conserved. The bsh gene was cloned into the pET21b expression vector and expressed in Escherichia coli BLR(DE3) by induction with 0.1mM of isopropylthiogalactopyranoside. The BSH enzyme was purified with apparent homogeneity using a Ni2+-NTA agarose column and characterized. The overexpressed recombinant BSH enzyme of L. acidophilus PF01 exhibited hydrolase activity against tauroconjugated bile salts, but not glycoconjugated bile salts. It showed the highest activity against taurocholic acid. The maximum BSH activity occurred at approximately 40oC. The enzyme maintained approximately 70% of its maximum activity even at 60 degrees , whereas its activity rapidly decreased at below 37 degrees . The optimum pH was 6, and BSH activity was rapidly inactivated below pH 5 and above pH 7.
TI  - A double blind randomized controlled trial of a probiotic combination in 100 patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a probiotic  combination on symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: We investigated the efficiency of a probiotic dietary supplement, containing four strains of lactic acid bacteria, on symptoms of IBS. One hundred and sixteen patients with IBS fulfilling the Rome II criteria were randomized in a parallel group, double-blind study to receive a placebo or a probiotic combination (1 x 10(10) cfu once daily) for four weeks. The symptoms that were monitored weekly included discomfort, abdominal pain, and stool frequency and quality. Quality of life was assessed before and at the end of the treatment using the SF36 and FDD-quality-of-life questionnaires. RESULTS: One hundred subjects completed the study (48 probiotic combination, 52 placebo). The probiotic combination was not superior to the placebo in relieving symptoms of IBS (42.6 versus 42.3% improvement). However, the decrease of abdominal pain between the first and the fourth week of treatment was significantly higher in probiotic treated patients (-41.9 versus -24.2%, P=0.048). Interesting findings from the IBS sub-groups were also observed such as a lower pain score at end point in patients with alternating bowel habits (P=0.023) and an increase of stool frequency in the constipated sub-group from the first week of probiotic treatment (P=0.043). CONCLUSIONS: The probiotic combination was not significantly superior to the placebo in relieving symptoms of IBS. Despite the apparent high placebo response, interesting findings from IBS sub-groups were observed in the field of abdominal pain and stool frequency.
TI  - Effect of lactulose on biotransformation of isoflavone glycosides to aglycones in soymilk by lactobacilli.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus 4461, L. acidophilus 4962, L. casei 290, and L. casei 2607 were used to hydrolyze isoflavone glycosides (IG) to biologically active forms--isoflavone aglycones (IA)--in soymilk (SM) prepared from soy protein isolate (SPI) and soymilk supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) of lactulose (SML). L. acidophilus 4461 utilized the highest level of lactulose (3.01 mg/mL) and L. acidophilus 4962 utilized the least (0.86 mg/mL) at 24 h of incubation. The pH values decreased to 4.00 to 5.00 in SML, while they remained relatively high (6.15 to 6.36) in SM. Supplementation with lactulose significantly (P < 0.05) enhanced the viable counts of all the 4 Lactobacillus strains. At the end of incubation, the viable counts of Lactobacillus ranged from 8.08 to 8.25 log CFU/mL in SML compared to 6.99 to 7.11 log CFU/mL in SM. Supplementation with lactulose increased the biotransformation of IG to IA after 6 h of incubation. The presence of lactulose in the medium enhanced the biotransformation level of IG to IA by Lactobacillus up to 21.9%. The hydrolysis level of malonyl genistin and acetyl genistin in SML was much higher than in SM by all the 4 probiotic organisms. The biotransformation of IG to IA occurred rapidly during the 1st 12 h of incubation in both SML and SM. Among the 4 Lactobacillus strains, L. acidophilus 4461 biotransformed the highest level (88.8%) of IG to IA in SML compared to 68.2% in SM after 24 h of incubation.
TI  - Influence of probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. helveticus on proteolysis, organic acid profiles, and ACE-inhibitory activity of cheddar cheeses ripened at 4, 8, and 12 degrees C.
AB  - The influence of adjunct bacteria on composition of cheeses, organic acid profiles, proteolysis, and ACE-inhibitory activity during ripening at 4, 8, and 12 degrees C for 24 wk was investigated. cheddar cheeses were made with starter lactococci (control), Lactobacillus acidophilus L10, and starter lactococci (L10), and L. acidophilus L10, L. helveticus H100, and starter lactococci (H100). The counts of L. acidophilus in L10 cheeses remained at >10(6) colony forming units (CFU)/g after 24 wk of ripening at 4, 8, and 12 degrees C. Concentrations of lactic, acetic, and propionic acids of the L10 and H100 cheeses were significantly higher than those of the control cheeses after 24 wk of ripening (P < 0.05). Proteolysis of the cheeses was improved as the ripening temperature increased. Water-soluble nitrogen, trichloroacetic acid soluble nitrogen, and phosphotungstic acid soluble nitrogen of L10 and H100 cheeses were significantly higher than those of the control cheeses (P < 0.05). Increase in ripening temperature from 4 degrees C to 8 and 12 degrees C increased the percentage of ACE inhibition. The IC(50) value among cheeses ripened at 4, 8, and 12 degrees C, however, was not significantly different (P > 0.05). Hence, probiotic L. acidophilus L10 can be added into cheddar cheeses to improve proteolysis and ACE-inhibitory activity.
TI  - Molecular analysis of phenol-degrading microbial strains.
AB  - In an attempt to estimate the occurrence of phenol hydroxylase-related gene sequences we performed a dot blot hybridization assay with DNA from phenol utilizing Trichosporon cutaneum R57 strain NBIMCC 2414 and microbial isolates from different wastewaters. The used oligonucletides were homologous to the 5'-end of TORPHD locus (NCBI)-coding phenol hydroxylase in Trichosporon cutaneum ATCC 46490 and to the 5'-end of TORCCMLE locus (NCBI)-coding cis,cis-muconate-lactonizing enzyme in Trichosporon cutaneum ATCC 58094. Two microbial strains, Escherichia coli JM 109 and Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356, incapable to degrade phenol were used as negative controls. We established the presence of hybridization with both used oligonucleotide probes in T. cutaneum R57 and T. cutaneum ATCC 46490 yeast strains. The experiments implemented with microbial isolates obtained from three industrialized areas in Bulgaria showed that 7 of them may carry sequences hybridizing with a phenol hydroxylase oligonucleotide probe. A subsequent hybridization test for the cis,cis-muconate-lactonizing enzyme showed that only 3 of them displayed a positive signal. Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 and Escherichia coli JM 109 strains' DNA used as negative controls in the experiments did not reveal any sequence similarity to the both applied oligonucleotides. The partial nucleotide sequences of 16S rDNAs of the isolated strains C1 and K1 obtained as PCR products were determined and sequenced. A comparison of these nucleotide sequences with similar sequences in NCBI Data Bank indicated that both C1 and K1 strains are closely related to the genera Acinetobacter and Burkholderia.
TI  - Screening of lactic acid bacteria from vacuum packaged beef for antimicrobial activity.
AB  - The objective of this study was to isolate lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from vacuum packaged beef and to investigate their antagonist activity. LAB mean counts of 5.19 log cfu/cm(2) were obtained from five samples of vacuum packaged beef. Two hundred isolates were selected and screened for the inhibitory effect on five ATCC reference Lactobacillus strains. Thirty six isolates showed activity in the agar spot test against at least two of the indicator strains. However, only six cell free supernatants (CFS) from these isolates exhibited activity against the indicator strains using the well-diffusion test and conditions that eliminated the effects of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide. L. acidophilus was the most sensitive indicator tested, whereas L. plantarum and L. fermentum were the most resistant ones. Identification by MIDI system indicated that these LAB isolates were Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Pediococcus acidilactici, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Lactobacillus casei GC subgroup A. The antagonistic factors produced by most of these LAB against L. acidophilus were resistant to heat treatment (100 degrees C for 10 min) and stable over a wide pH range (4.0 to 9.0). These data suggest that these isolates could be used as promising hurdles aiming increased safety and extended shelf life of meat products.
TI  - The effect of probiotic dahi containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei on gastropathic consequences in diabetic rats.
AB  - In the present study, the effects of oral administration of probiotic dahi containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei on gastropathic consequences in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were evaluated, and effects were compared with skim milk- and control dahi-fed groups. The feeding of probiotic dahi did not change the blood glucose levels in chronic hyperglycemic conditions. The rate of charcoal transit was significantly higher in probiotic dahi-fed animals than in those of the diabetic control group (P < .05). Moreover, the oral administration of probiotic dahi significantly increased counts of lactobacilli adherent to epithelial walls and free in the lumen of the small and large intestine, while decreasing attached as well as free coliform counts (P < .05). In addition, probiotic dahi reversed the decrease in total lactobacilli and increase in total coliforms in fecal samples of diabetic animals. It was also shown that oral ingestion of probiotic dahi reduced the oxidative stress marker thiobarbituric acid-reactive species in intestinal tissues and glycosylation of hemoglobin (P < .05). All the effects were predominantly higher in the probiotic dahi-fed group than the skim milk- and control dahi-fed groups. The results indicate that probiotic dahi may be used as a therapeutic regimen to diminish the gastropathic consequences of diabetes.
TI  - Whey fermentation by thermophilic lactic acid bacteria: evolution of carbohydrates and protein content.
AB  - Whey, a by-product of the cheese industry usually disposed as waste, is a source  of biological and functional valuable proteins. The aim of this work was to evaluate the potentiality of three lactic acid bacteria strains to design a starter culture for developing functional whey-based drinks. Fermentations were performed at 37 and 42 degrees C for 24h in reconstituted whey powder (RW). Carbohydrates, organic acids and amino acids concentrations during fermentation were evaluated by RP-HPLC. Proteolytic activity was measured by the o-phthaldialdehyde test and hydrolysis of whey proteins was analyzed by Tricine SDS-PAGE. The studied strains grew well (2-3log cfu/ml) independently of the temperature used. Streptococcus thermophilus CRL 804 consumed 12% of the initial lactose concentration and produced the highest amount of lactic acid (45 mmol/l) at 24h. Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CRL 454 was the most proteolytic (91 microg Leu/ml) strain and released the branched chain amino acids Leu and Val. In contrast, Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 636 and S. thermophilus CRL 804 consumed most of the amino acids present in whey. The studied strains were able to degrade the major whey proteins, alpha-lactalbumin being degraded in a greater extent (2.2-3.4-fold) than beta-lactoglobulin. Two starter cultures were evaluated for their metabolic and proteolytic activities in RW. Both cultures acidified and reduced the lactose content in whey in a greater extent than the strains alone. The amino acid release was higher (86 microg/ml) for the starter SLb (strains CRL 804+CRL 454) than for SLa (strains CRL 804+CRL 636, 37 microg/ml). Regarding alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin degradation, no differences were observed as compared to the values obtained with the single cultures. The starter culture SLb showed high potential to be used for developing fermented whey-based beverages.
TI  - Conjugated linoleic acids produced by Lactobacillus dissociates IKK-gamma and Hsp90 complex in Helicobacter pylori-infected gastric epithelial cells.
AB  - Although probiotics have been reported to reduce the gastric inflammatory response to Helicobacter pylori infection, little information is available regarding the molecular mechanisms behind this reduction. This study investigates the role of conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) produced by probiotics in interactions of IkappaB kinase (IKK) and heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) to activate the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway in human gastric epithelial cells infected with H. pylori. Conditioned medium (CM) containing Lactobacillus acidophilus-producing CLA significantly inhibited the activated NF-kappaB signals and the upregulated expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) in MKN-45 cells infected with H. pylori. Pretreatment with CM with CLA attenuated the increased IKK activity induced by H. pylori. Transfection of siRNA for IKK-beta dramatically reduced H. pylori-induced IkappaBalpha phosphorylation, but siRNA for IKK-alpha had little effect on IkappaBalpha phosphorylation, although the siRNA for IKK-alpha significantly decreased IL-8 production. Furthermore, Hsp90 was associated with IKK-alpha and IKK-gamma in H. pylori-infected cells, and CM with CLA dissociated the complex between Hsp90 and IKK-gamma. These results suggest that CLA produced by probiotics has anti-inflammatory activity in gastric epithelial cells infected with H. pylori via dissociation of the IKK-gamma and Hsp90 complex.
TI  - The effect of probiotics and organic acids on Shiga-toxin 2 gene expression in enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.
AB  - Probiotics are known to have an inhibitory effect against the growth of various foodborne pathogens, however, the specific role of probiotics in Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) virulence gene expression has not been well defined. Shiga toxins are members of a family of highly potent bacterial toxins and are the main virulence marker for STEC. Shiga toxins inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells and play a role in hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome. STEC possesses Shiga toxin 1 (Stx1) and Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2), both of which have A and B subunits. Although STEC containing both Stx1 and Stx2 has been isolated from patients with hemorrhagic colitis, Stx2 is more frequently associated with human disease complications. Thus, the effect of Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, and Bifidobacterium strains on stx2A expression levels in STEC was investigated. Lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were isolated from farm animals, dairy, and human sources and included L. rhamnosus GG, L. curvatus, L. plantarum, L. jensenii, L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. reuteri, P. acidilactici, P. cerevisiae, P. pentosaceus, B. thermophilum, B. boum, B. suis and B. animalis. E. coli O157:H7 (EDL 933) was coincubated with sub-lethal concentrations of each probiotic strain. Following RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis, relative stx2A mRNA levels were determined according to a comparative critical threshold (Ct) real-time PCR. Data were normalized to the endogenous control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and the level of stx2A expression between treated and untreated STEC was compared. Observed for all probiotic strains tested, stx2A was down-regulated, when compared to the control culture. Probiotic production of organic acids, as demonstrated by a decrease in pH, influenced stx2A gene expression.
TI  - Targeting mucosal dendritic cells with microbial antigens from probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The use of vaccines against infectious microbes has been critical to the advancement of medicine. Vaccine strategies combined with, or without, adjuvants have been established to eradicate various bacterial and viral pathogens. A new generation of vaccines is being developed using specific strains of Gram-positive, lactic acid bacteria and, notably, some probiotic lactobacilli. These bacteria have been safely consumed by humans for centuries in fermented foods. Thus, they can be orally administered, are well tolerated by recipients and could be easily and economically provided to large populations. In this overview, we focus on mucosal immunity and how its cellular component(s), particularly dendritic cells, can be specifically targeted to deliver immunogenic subunits, such as the protective antigen from Bacillus anthracis (the causative agent of anthrax). An antigen-specific immune response can be elicited using specific strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus expressing the protective antigen. A mucosal, dendritic cell-targeted approach increases the bioavailability of an immunogen of interest when delivered orally by L. acidophilus. This provides an efficiently elegant natural strategy and serves a dual function as an immune-stimulating adjuvant in vivo.
TI  - Screening of Lactobacilli derived from chicken feces and partial characterization of Lactobacillus acidophilus A12 as an animal probiotics.
AB  - This study was performed to screen and select Lactobacillus strains from chicken  feces for probiotic use in animals. Of these strains, strain A12 had the highest immunostimulatory effect. Therefore, strain A12 was characterized as a potential probiotic. Strain A12 was tentatively identified as Lactobacillus acidophilus A12, using the API 50 CHL kit based on a 99.9% homology. L. acidophilus A12 was highly resistant to artificial gastric juice (pH 2.5) and bile acid (oxgall). Based on results from the API ZYM kit, leucine arylamidase, crystine arylamidase, acid phosphatase, naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase, alpha-galactosidase, beta- galactosidase, alpha-glucosidase, beta-glucosidase, and N-acetyl-beta- glucosamidase were produced by strain A12. L. acidophilus A12 showed resistance to several antibiotics (nisin, gentamycin, and erythromycin). The amount of interleukin (IL)-1alpha in 20x concentrated supernatant from L. acidophilus A12 was approximately 156 pg/ml. With regard to antioxidant activity, L. acidophilus A12 supernatant showed 60.6% DPPH radical scavenging activity. These results demonstrate the potential use of L. acidophilus A12 as a health-promoting probiotics.
TI  - Lactic acid bacterial fermentation increases the antiallergic effects of Ixeris dentata.
AB  - Ixeris dentata (ID, family Asteraceae), called Seumbakuy in Korea, was fermented  with lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and their antiallergic activities were investigated. Fermentation of ID with Bifidobacterium breve or Lactobacillus acidophilus increased its inhibition of degranulation in RBL-2H3 cells induced by the IgE-antigen complex. Oral administration of these extracts to mice inhibited the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) reaction induced by the IgE-antigen complex and scratching behaviors induced by compound 48/80. The fermented ID more potently inhibited the PCA reaction and scratching behaviors than the non-fermented one. These extracts also inhibited mRNA expression of TNF-alpha and IL-4, as well as NF-kappaB activation in RBL-2H3 cells induced by the IgE-antigen complex. These findings suggest that LAB fermentation improves ID-mediated inhibition of IgE-induced allergic diseases such as rhinitis and asthma, and that ID works by inhibiting degranulation and NF-kB activation in mast cells and basophils.
TI  - Proteolytic profiles and angiotensin-I converting enzyme and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activities of selected lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - This study was conducted to examine the growth, proteolytic profiles as well as angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) and alpha-glucosidase (alpha-glu) inhibitory potentials of selected strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Two strains each of yogurt bacteria (Streptococcus thermophilus-1275 and 285, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus-1092 and 1368), and probiotics (L. acidophilus-4461 and 33200, and L. casei-2607 and 15286, and 1 strain of Bifidobacterium longum 5022), were cultivated in reconstituted skim milk (RSM) at 37 degrees C and their proteolytic profiles and ACE as well as alpha-glu inhibitory activities were determined. Among all the strains of lactic acid bacteria studied, yogurt bacteria grew very well, with the exception of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 1368 which showed a slower growth during the initial 3 h of incubation. The growth pattern corresponded well with the decrease in pH for the organisms. All the organisms showed an increase in proteolysis with time. The variations in proteolytic capabilities translated into corresponding variations in ACE inhibitory potential of these organisms. Bifidobacterium longum 5022 showed the highest ACE inhibitory potential followed by L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 1368, L. casei 15286, S. thermophilus 1275, and L. acidophilus 4461. Organisms with high intracellular enzymatic activities grew well. Also, aminopeptidases of strains of L. acidophilus 4461 and S. thermophilus 1275 that could better utilize proline containing substrates showed enhanced ACE inhibitory potential. Lactic acid bacteria possessed the ability to inhibit alpha-glu activity, which endowed them an antidiabetic property as well.
TI  - Fermentation of reconstituted skim milk supplemented with soy protein isolate by  probiotic organisms.
AB  - Utilization of lactose and production of organic acid were determined in reconstituted skim milk (RSM) and RSM supplemented with soy protein isolate (SPI) (RSMS) by 6 probiotic organisms, including L. acidophilus 4461, L. acidophilus 4962, L. casei 290, L. casei 2607, B. animalis subsp. lactis bb12, and B. longum 20099. The viable counts of probiotic organisms of RSM and RSMS were enumerated and pH measured during fermentation. Our results showed that 3% to 10% more lactose was utilized by all the 6 probiotic microorganisms from RSMS than RSM. All 6 probiotic organisms produced significantly more acetic acid in RSMS than RSM. However, the viable microbial populations in RSMS were lower than those in RSM due to lower pH of the former. It appears that addition of SPI enhanced lactose utilization and acetic acid production but slightly reduced the lactic acid production and the growth of probiotic microorganisms.
TI  - Effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus supernatants on body weight and leptin expression in rats.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus extracts and supernatants have been used as probiotics  in human and veterinary medicine for their ability to enhance wound healing and immunity. Previous data from our laboratory demonstrated that Lactobacillus supernatant (LS) stimulated wound healing, angiogenesis and proliferation of embryonic cells after topical application. This current study shows that LS after its administration into the cerebral ventricles of male rats exerts systemic effects. METHODS: The right lateral cerebral ventricle of young male rats was accessed through intracerebroventricular cannulation (ICV) under anesthesia and aseptic conditions. One group of control rats received saline solution, a second control group received 0.8 M lactic acid solution (to control for acidity of LS), and a third group received LS. The animals were sacrificed 12, 24, 48, 96 and 120 hours after the injection. Selected tissues were collected, fixed in 10% buffered formalin and used for immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Other tissues were frozen and extracted for immunoblotting RESULTS: LS-injected animals had a slight decrease in body weight when compared to their initial weight and to both control groups. Using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization leptin expression was studied in multiple brain sections and peripheral adipose tissue of control and LS-injected rats. Strong cytoplasmic stain was observed by both techniques in neurons of the cerebral cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus and, to lesser degree, in the cells of the choroid plexus in the LS-injected rats. Control animals demonstrated much less intense staining in neurons located in the same regions using immunohistochemistry and almost no staining with in situ hybridization technique. Adipose tissue exhibited slight presence of leptin in LS-treated animals. In contrast no immunohistochemical staining for GM-CSF and TNFalpha was observed in brains from control and treated rats. Western blotting showed mild increase in leptin and leptin receptors in intestines and retroperitoneal adipose tissues of LS-injected rats. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that direct administration of LS into rat CNS leads to a decrease in body weight of rats and an increase in the expression of leptin in specific areas of the brain and retroperitoneal adipose tissue.
TI  - Probiotics for the treatment or prevention of atopic dermatitis: a review of the  evidence from randomized controlled trials.
AB  - Probiotics are defined as live microorganisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. To synthesize the evidence for the effectiveness of probiotics in the treatment or prevention of atopic dermatitis (AD) in children, we reviewed the results of 13 relevant randomized (placebo)-controlled trials (RCTs), 10 of which evaluated probiotics as treatment and 3 for prevention of AD. The main outcome measure in 9 RCTs was the change in SCORAD (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis). Four RCTs suggested that there was a statistically significant decrease in SCORAD after probiotic administration to infants or children with AD for 1 or 2 months compared with that after placebo, while in two RCTs SCORAD was significantly reduced after treatment with lactobacilli only in children with IgE-associated AD. In four of these six RCTs, clinical improvement was associated with a change in some inflammatory markers. In three RCTs, the change in SCORAD was not statistically significant between probiotic- and placebo-treated children, although in one of these trials SCORAD was significantly lower after probiotic than with placebo treatment in food-sensitized children. In most RCTs, probiotics did not cause a statistically significant change in interferon-gamma, interleukin-4, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, eosinophil cationic protein or transforming growth factor-beta compared with placebo. Regarding the effectiveness of probiotics in the prevention of AD, in two RCTs, infants at high risk for atopy who received probiotics developed AD significantly less frequently during the first 2 years of life than infants who received placebo. In these studies, mothers were administered Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG with or without other probiotics perinatally, followed by treatment of the infants with the same probiotics for the first 6 months of life. However, in another trial, neither the frequency nor the severity of AD during the first year of life were significantly different between infants with atopic mothers who received L. acidophilus for the first 6 months of life compared with infants who received placebo.Probiotics, especially L. rhamnosus GG, seem to be effective for the prevention of AD. They were also found to reduce the severity of AD in approximately half of the RCTs evaluated, although they were not found to change significantly most of the inflammatory markers measured in the majority of the RCTs evaluated. More RCTs need to be conducted to elucidate whether probiotics are useful for the treatment or prevention of AD.
TI  - Influence of human dentine on the antibacterial activity of self-etching adhesive systems against cariogenic bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The incorporation of antibacterial agents into adhesive systems has been proposed to eliminate residual bacteria from dentine. This study used the agar diffusion method to evaluate the antibacterial activity of Clearfil Protect Bond (CPB), Clearfil SE Bond (CSEB), Clearfil Tri-S Bond (C3SB) and Xeno-III (XIII) self-etching adhesive systems, with or without light-activation, against cariogenic bacteria, and to assess the influence of human dentine on the antibacterial activity of these materials. METHODS: An aliquot of 10 microl per material (and individual components) were pipetted onto paper and dentine discs distributed in Petri dishes containing bacterial culture in BHI agar. Positive control was 0.2% chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX). RESULTS: After incubation, the adhesive components of CPB and CSEB, liquid A of XIII and C3SB did not present antibacterial activity when applied to paper discs. The non-light-activated CPB primer+adhesive promoted the greatest inhibition of Streptococcus mutans (p<0.05), whereas with light-activation, there was no significant difference between primer+adhesive and primer alone. For Lactobacillus acidophilus, CPB primer presented the greatest antibacterial activity in both light-activation conditions (p<0.05). Regarding the dentine discs, only CHX promoted an inhibitory effect, though less intense than on paper discs (p<0.05). CHX presented greater antibacterial activity against S. mutans than against L. acidophilus (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Light-activation significantly reduced the antibacterial activity of the self-etching adhesive systems; MDPB incorporation contributed to the effect of adhesive systems against cariogenic bacteria; the components eluted from the adhesive systems were not capable to diffuse through 400 microm-thick dentine disc to exert their antibacterial activity against cariogenic bacteria.
TI  - Therapeutic effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus-SDC 2012, 2013 in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
AB  - Probiotic bacteria exhibit a variety of properties, which are unique to a particular strain. Lactobacillus acidophilus-SDC 2012, 2013 are new strains isolated from Korean infants' feces. The potential utility of Lactobacillus acidophilus-SDC 2012, 2013 in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) was studied. Forty IBS patients were randomized into a placebo (n = 20) and probiotics group (n = 20). Four weeks of treatment with L. acidophilus-SDC 2012, 2013 was associated with a reduced score for abdominal pain or discomfort compared to the baseline (P = 0.011). The percent reduction in abdominal pain or discomfort exceeded the placebo scores by more than 20% (23.8 and 0.2% for probiotics and placebo, respectively, P = 0.003). There was a significant difference in the proportion of responders between the probiotics and placebo groups (P = 0.011). There was no drop out or adverse events for either group during the study period. Lactobacillus acidophilus-SDC 2012, 2013 appeared to have a beneficial effect in patients with IBS. Further studies are warranted.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological analysis of subjects treated with Branemark or AstraTech implants: a 7-year follow-up study.
AB  - AIMS: To assess the impact of different implant systems on the clinical conditions and the microbiota at implants, and whether the presence of bacteria at tooth sites was predictive of the presence at implant sites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subjects with either AstraTech or Branemark in function for 7 years were enrolled. Sub-gingival bacterial samples at tooth and implant sites were collected with sterile endodontic paper points, and analyzed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method (40 species). RESULTS: Fifty-four subjects, 27 supplied with AstraTech (n=132 implants) and 27 with Branemark (n=102) implants, were studied. Test tooth sites had significantly less evidence of bleeding on probing (P<0.001) and presence of plaque (P<0.001) than implant test sites. Implant sites presented with deeper probing pocket depth than tooth sites (mean difference: 1.1 mm, standard error of differences: 0.08, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.9-1.3, P<0.001). Tannerella forsythia (P<0.05), Capnocytophaga sputigena (P<0.05), Actinomyces israelii (P<0.05) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (P<0.05) were found at higher levels at tooth surfaces. No differences in bacterial load for any species were found between the two implant systems. The odds of being present/absent at tooth and implants sites were only significant for Staphylococcus aureus [odds ratio (OR): 5.2 : 1, 95% CI: 1.4-18.9, P<0.01]. CONCLUSIONS: After 7 years in function, implants presented with deeper probing depths than teeth. S. aureus was commonly present at both teeth and implants sites. S. aureus at tooth sites was predictive of also being present at implant sites.
TI  - Effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus 43121 and a mixture of Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium longum on the serum cholesterol level and fecal sterol excretion in hypercholesterolemia-induced pigs.
AB  - The hypocholesterolemic effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus 43121 (43121) and a  mixture of Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium longum (MIX) were studied in hypercholesterolemia-induced pigs. Serum total cholesterol was decreased by supplementation of either 43121 or MIX, although, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was not changed. The hypocholesterolemic effect of 43121 and MIX was mainly due to bile acid dehydroxylation, this effect being supplementation-time dependent.
TI  - Gut immune stimulation by non pathogenic Gram(+) and Gram(-) bacteria. Comparison with a probiotic strain.
AB  - We analyzed the gut immune stimulation induced by Gram-positive bacteria: non probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 1462 and Lactobacillus acidophilus A9; two potentially probiotic strains: L. acidophilus CRL 924 and Lactobacillusdelbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CRL 423; comparatively with a probiotic strain: Lactobacillus casei CRL 431. We also studied Gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli 129 and E. coli 13-7 in BALB/c mice. All the strains increased the number of IgA+ cells. We analyzed the cytokines IFNgamma, TNFalpha, IL-17, IL-12, IL-6 and MIP-1alpha. The Gram(+) strains increased the number of IL-10+ cells. Gram(-) strains did not increase IL-10+ cells, but they increased the number of IL-12+ cells. The probiotic strain increased mainly IFNgamma and TNFalpha. In the study of the receptors TLR-2, TLR-4 and CD-206, we demonstrated that only the probiotic strain increased the number of CD-206+ cells. All the Gram(+) strains increased the number of TLR-2+ cells and the Gram(-) strains of the TLR-4+ cells. The probiotic strain induced the release of IL-6 by a preparation enriched in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC). Gram(+) and Gram(-) bacteria activated different immune receptors and induced a different cytokine profile. The probiotic strain showed a great activity on the immune cells and the enriched population in IEC, activating mainly cells of the innate immune system.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of antibacterial activity of an herbal dentifrice against Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Antibacterial activity of a herbal dentifrice Arodent against Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus was evaluated using Colgate as standard. Both bacterial strains were isolated from the oral cavity on selective media and identified by standard methods. The antibacterial activity was assayed by cup-well method. The bacterial lawn of facultative anaerobe S. mutans was established between two layers of agar under microaerophilic conditions. Five and a half millimeters and 10 mm zones of inhibition were produced by Arodent against S. mutans and L. acidophilus , respectively, under microaerophilic conditions. On the other hand, the standard dentifrice Colgate produced 5.83 mm and 10.17 mm zones of inhibition against S. mutans and L. acidophilus , respectively, under microaerophilic condition. The results suggest that Arodent is an effective antibacterial herbal dentifrice.
TI  - Long-term antibacterial effects and physical properties of a chlorhexidine-containing glass ionomer cement.
AB  - STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM: Many regions in the world do not have electricity, water, or access to dental facilities that allows the treatment of caries with dental handpieces and rotary burs. For restorative techniques used in these regions, an antibacterial self-adherent glass ionomer material would contribute considerably. PURPOSE: This study aimed to test if chlorhexidine diacetate (Fluka BioChemika, Buchs, Switzerland)- or chlorhexidine digluconate (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany)-added ChemFil Superior glass ionomer cement (Dentsply DeTrey, Konstanz, Germany) had any long-term antibacterial effect against certain oral bacteria and to test the new formulation's physical properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ChemFil Superior was used as a control. Chlorhexidine diacetate (powder) was added to the powder and chlorhexidine digluconate (liquid) was mixed with the powder in order to obtain 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5% concentrations of the respective groups. Setting time, compressive strength, and acid erosion were tested according to ISO 9917-1. Working time, hardness, diametral tensile strength, and biaxial flexural strength were also determined. Long-term antimicrobial activity against S. mutans, L. acidophilus, and C. albicans were tested with the agar diffusion method. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for comparison (p < 0.05). RESULTS: Regarding the immediate antibacterial effect for S. mutans, all the tested groups showed inhibitions of the strain compared with the control group (p < 0.05), with larger zones for the higher concentration groups and all the diacetates. For L. acidophilus, all the groups were effective compared with the control, but the greatest antibacterial effect was observed with the 2.5% diacetate group. The 2.5% group of chlorhexidine diacetate showed antibacterial activity up to 90 days against S. mutans and up to 60 days against L. acidophilus. The working and setting time, acid erosion test, diametral tensile strength, and biaxial flexural strength of the tested groups were not different from the control ChemFil group. However, the 1.25 and 2.5% groups of chlorhexidine diacetate had significantly lower compressive strengths than the control group. Lower hardness values were obtained with the 0.5 and 2.5% chlorhexidine digluconate groups in comparison with the control group. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The results of this in vitro investigation demonstrated that chlorhexidine diacetate or digluconate added to the ChemFil Superior glass ionomer material can exhibit long-term antibacterial effects against S. mutans and L. acidophilus without compromising the physical properties of the material.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of milkfat globule membrane fractions.
AB  - Milkfat globule membranes (MFGMs) were prepared from bovine cream according to standard procedures. These membranes and peptide hydrolysates, which were generated by proteolysis with immobilized digestive enzymes, were screened for antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica Typhimurium, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Bacillus cereus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus gasseri. Assays were first performed on beef heart infusion (BHI) plates spotted with test protein-peptide fractions and then seeded with lawns of indicator cells to monitor the zone of growth inhibition. Under these experimental conditions, MFGMs were most active against Salmonella Typhimurium and P. fluorescens. However, antibacterial activity was not seen after plating on Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. We determined that the antimicrobial effects observed on BHI plates were due to the generation of H2O2 by xanthine oxidase, a major protein constituent of the MFGMs, as a result of purine catalysis. This substrate is present in BHI but lacking in LB medium. Evaluation of purified xanthine oxidase alone resulted in analogous data trends. The growth of probiotic Lactobacillus strains were affected only marginally when grown on lactobacilli deMan Rogosa Sharpe plates, suggesting the decreased sensitivity of these bacteria to H2O2. In this study, several MFGM hydrolysates exhibited variable antibacterial activity against test food pathogens on agar plates prepared with M9 minimal media, and this variation was not attributable to xanthine oxidase enzymatic activity. The probiotic microorganisms were mostly resilient to these antibacterial fractions. Bovine MFGM fractions may represent an excellent resource material from which to generate native, naturally occurring biodefensive proteins and/or peptides.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of culture fluid components of Lactobacillus fermentum strain 90 TS-4 (21) clone 3, and their capacity to modulate adhesion of Candida albicans yeast-like fungi to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  - Antagonistic activities of L. fermentum strain 90 TS-4 (21), L. casei ATCC 27216, and L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 and bactericidal activity of lactobacillus culture fluid towards E. coli strain K12, S. aureus, and S. epidermidis test cultures were studied. The bactericidal effect of L. fermentum strain 90 TS-4 (21) clone 3 culture fluid preparation (pH 6.0) on the test cultures was dose-dependent. Adhesion of C. albicans yeast-like fungi to vaginal epitheliocytes was more pronounced for strains isolated from women with asymptomatic infection than for strains isolated from women with manifest forms. L. fermentum strain 90 TS-4 (21) clone 3 culture fluid preparation modulated adhesion of yeast-like fungi only if the fungal strain was initially highly adherent.
TI  - Probiotic Crescenza cheese containing Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus manufactured with high-pressure homogenized milk.
AB  - High-pressure homogenization (HPH) is one of the most promising alternatives to traditional thermal treatment of food preservation and diversification. Its effectiveness on the deactivation of pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms in model systems and real food is well documented. To evaluate the potential of milk treated by HPH for the production of Crescenza cheese with commercial probiotic lactobacilli added, 4 types of cheeses were made: HPH (from HPH-treated milk), P (from pasteurized milk), HPH-P (HPH-treated milk plus probiotics), and P-P (pasteurized milk plus probiotics) cheeses. A strain of Streptococcus thermophilus was used as starter culture for cheese production. Compositional, microbiological, physicochemical, and organoleptic analyses were carried out at 1, 5, 8, and 12 d of refrigerated storage (4 degrees C). According to results obtained, no significant differences among the 4 cheese types were observed for gross composition (protein, fat, moisture) and pH. Differently, the HPH treatment of milk increased the cheese yield about 1% and positively affected the viability during the refrigerated storage of the probiotic bacteria. In fact, after 12 d of storage, the Lactobacillus paracasei A13 cell loads were 8 log cfu/ g, whereas Lactobacillus acidophilus H5 exhibited, in P-P cheese, a cell load decrease of about 1 log cfu/g with respect to the HPH-P cheese. The hyperbaric treatment had a significant positive effect on free fatty acids release and cheese proteolysis. Also, probiotic cultures affected proteolytic and lipolytic cheese patterns. No significant differences were found for the sensory descriptors salty and creamy among HPH and P cheeses as well as for acid, piquant, sweet, milky, salty, creamy, and overall acceptance among HPH, HPH-P, and P-P Crescenza cheeses.
TI  - Toll-like receptor 2 and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-2 play divergent roles in the recognition of gut-derived lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in dendritic cells.
AB  - The gut microbiota is vital in the maintenance of homeostasis in the gut immune system. Its diversity and composition play major roles in relation to allergies and inflammatory bowel diseases, and administration of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, has positive effects on these pathologies. However, the mechanisms behind the beneficial effects are largely unknown. Here we reveal divergent roles played by Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-2 (NOD2) in dendritic cell (DC) recognition of LAB. Murine bone-marrow-derived DC lacking NOD2 produce higher levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and reduced levels of IL-12 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in response to LAB. This indicates that peptidoglycan is partly responsible for the T helper type 1 skewing effect of certain LAB. Dendritic cells that are TLR2-/- produce less IL-12 and TNF-alpha and more IL-10 in response to some strains of lactobacilli, while they produce more IL-12 and less IL-10 in response to bifidobacteria. The same tendency was found in human monocyte-derived DC. We have previously reported that the weak IL-12-inducing and TNF-alpha-inducing bifidobacteria inhibit the T helper type 1 skewing effect induced by strong immunostimulatory lactobacilli. Here we show that this immunoinhibitory effect of bifidobacteria is dependent on TLR2 and independent of NOD2. Moreover, independently of the cytokine pattern induced by intact LAB, cell wall fractions of all LAB, as well as synthetic lipoproteins possess immunoinhibitory capacities in both human and murine DC. These novel findings suggest that LAB act as immunoregulators through interaction of lipoprotein with TLR2 and as immunostimulators through interaction of peptidoglycan with NOD2.
TI  - Effect of Versagel on the growth and metabolic activities of selected lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - In this study, the influence of a protein-based fat replacer, Versagel added at 1% and 2% (w/v) to reconstituted skim milk (RSM), on the growth and metabolic activities of selected strains of yogurt starters (Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus) as well as probiotic organisms (Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium longum) was examined. Addition of Versagel resulted in significantly improved growth of S. thermophilus and B. longum but inhibited that of L. casei, L. acidophilus, and L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. This is also reflected in the extent of reduction of pH in RSM with added Versagel by these organisms. Among the biochemical activities, proteolytic activity of all the organisms except B. longum was adversely affected by the presence of Versagel, although the angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and alpha-glucosidase (alpha-glu) inhibitory activities were improved. Versagel at 1% level influenced the growth, while ACE inhibitory and alpha-glu inhibitory activities of the organisms were better at 2% level.
TI  - Production of beta-glucosidase and hydrolysis of isoflavone phytoestrogens by Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium lactis, and Lactobacillus casei in soymilk.
AB  - The study determined beta-glucosidase activity of commercial probiotic organisms  for hydrolysis of isoflavone to aglycones in fermenting soymilk. Soymilk made with soy protein isolate (SPI) was fermented with Lactobacillus acidophilus LAFTI L10, Bifidobacterium lactis LAFTI B94, and Lactobacillus casei LAFTI L26 at 37 degrees C for 48 h and the fermented soymilk was stored for 28 d at 4 degrees C. beta-Glucosidase activity of organisms was determined using rho-nitrophenyl beta-D-glucopyranoside as a substrate and the hydrolysis of isoflavone glycosides to aglycones by these organisms was carried out. The highest level of growth occurred at 12 h for L. casei L26, 24 h for B. lactis B94, and 36 h for L. acidophilus L10 during fermentation in soymilk. Survival after storage at 4 degrees C for 28 d was 20%, 15%, and 11% greater (P < 0.05) than initial cell counts, respectively. All the bacteria produced beta-glucosidase, which hydrolyzed isoflavone beta-glycosides to isoflavone aglycones. The decrease in the concentration of beta-glycosides and the increase in the concentration of aglycones were significant (P < 0.05) in the fermented soymilk. Increased isoflavone aglycone content in fermented soymilk is likely to improve the biological functionality of soymilk.
TI  - Effect of moderate electric field frequency on growth kinetics and metabolic activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Moderate electric fields (MEF) have been previously shown to alter the metabolic  activity of microbial cells; thus, the effect of frequency and electric field would be of considerable interest. We investigated herein the effects of MEF frequency on microbial growth kinetics and bacteriocin (Lacidin A) production of Lactobacillus acidophilus OSU 133 during fermentation. The following fermentation treatments were compared: conventional (for 40 h), MEF (1 V cm(-1), for 40 h), combination of MEF (1 V cm(-1), for the first 5 h) and conventional (for 35 h) at various frequency levels (45, 60, and 90 Hz) all at 30 degrees C, and control (conventional) fermentation at 37 degrees C. MEF treatments with purely sinusoidal waveforms at all frequencies at 30 degrees C produced a shorter lag phase than conventional fermentation. However, no lag phase reduction was found for a 60 Hz waveform that contained high-frequency harmonics. There was, however, a significant increase in the bacteriocin production under early MEF treatment at 60 Hz with high-frequency harmonics. On the basis of these observations, the fermentation process is accelerated by applying pure sinusoidal MEF at the early stage of growth while a significant increase in the bacteriocin production occurs when sinusoidal field at 60 Hz with harmonics is applied at the early stage of the growth.
TI  - Three Lactobacillus strains from healthy infant stool inhibit enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli grown in vitro.
AB  - Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are a major cause of sporadic diarrhea disease in humans, affecting mainly infants in developing countries and travelers from industrialized countries visiting tropical or subtropical areas. In this study, we screen the antagonistic activity by inoculating wells among ETEC agar cultures to assess inhibition zones created by the lactobacilli spent culture supernatant (SCS) from healthy infant stool. Only three isolates possessed antagonistic activity, acid and bile tolerance and could adhere to the cultured human intestinal C2BBel (Caco-2) cell line. Isolate identification using API 50CHL strips showed that they belonged to different Lactobacillus species, i.e., Lactobacillus acidophilus RY2, Lactobacillus salivarius MM1 and Lactobacillus paracasei En4. The SCS still had an inhibitory effect on ETEC after heating (100 degrees C, 15 min). The lactate dehydrogenase treatment or the pH of SCS was adjusted to neutral (pH 7.2) to reduce the SCS inhibitory effect. Antimicrobial activity was performed by incubating the lactic acid bacteria (LAB)-SCS with ETEC suspension. After 4h of co-culture, ETEC growth was inhibited. This study suggests that L. acidophilus RY2, L. salivarius MM1 and L. paracasei En4 could be used as an effective control for ETEC.
TI  - Development and evaluation of acid-buffering bioadhesive vaginal tablet for mixed vaginal infections.
AB  - An acid-buffering bioadhesive vaginal tablet was developed for the treatment of genitourinary tract infections. From the bioadhesion experiment and release studies it was found that polycarbophil and sodium carboxymethylcellulose is a good combination for an acid-buffering bioadhesive vaginal tablet. Sodium monocitrate was used as a buffering agent to provide acidic pH (4.4), which is an attribute of a healthy vagina. The effervescent mixture (citric acid and sodium bicarbonate) along with a superdisintegrant (Ac-Di-sol) was used to enhance the swellability of the bioadhesive tablet. The drugs clotrimazole (antifungal) and metronidazole (antiprotozoal as well as an antibacterial) were used in the formulation along with Lactobacillus acidophilus spores to treat mixed vaginal infections. From the ex vivo retention study it was found that the bioadhesive polymers hold the tablet for more than 24 hours inside the vaginal tube. The hardness of the acid-buffering bioadhesive vaginal tablet was optimized, at 4 to 5 kg hardness the swelling was found to be good and the cumulative release profile of the developed tablet was matched with a marketed conventional tablet (Infa-V). The in vitro spreadability of the swelled tablet was comparable to the marketed gel. In the in vitro antimicrobial study it was found that the acid-buffering bioadhesive tablet produces better antimicrobial action than marketed intravaginal drug delivery systems (Infa-V, Candid-V and Canesten 1).
TI  - Analysis of vaginal lactic acid producing bacteria in healthy women.
AB  - Vaginal lactic acid-producing bacteria of 80 pre-menopausal women were studied by isolation on Blood and DeMan-Rogosa-Sharpe agar, PCR with group-specific primers for Lactobacillus-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and PCR with specific primers for V3 region in 16S rRNA-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (TTGE). Conventional isolation method on media detected only one lactobacillus (Lactobacillus brevis) while TTGE detected only Lactobacillus sp. DGGE detected seven Lactobacillus species; L. coleohominis, L. crispatus, L. iners, L. reuteri, L. rhamnosus, L. vaginalis, and Leuconostoc lactis. L. acidophilus and L. gasseri, which are prevalent in Western women, were not detected in Korean women. Furthermore, L. rhamnosus, Leuc. lactis, L. coleohominis, and Weissella cibaria, which were not previously reported in the vaginal microbiota of Korean women, were detected. The five most prevalent LABs in vaginal microbiota in Korean women were L. iners, Enterococcus faecalis, L. crispatus, Leuc. lactis, and W. cibaria.
TI  - Effect of proton pump inhibitor pantoprazole on growth and morphology of oral Lactobacillus strains.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) used to suppress acid secretion in the stomach are among the most widely prescribed medications. There is emerging evidence of proton secretion elsewhere in the aerodigestive tract, and acidic microenvironments are integral to oral flora such as Lactobacillus. The hypothesis of this study is that the growth rate and morphology of oral Lactobacillus strains are effected by PPIs. METHODS: Nineteen different strains of Lactobacilli were inoculated in microtiter plates at pH of 4.5 to 6.5 and exposed to twofold dilutions of pantoprazole at a range of 2.5 mg/mL to 2.5 microg/mL. Bacterial growth was monitored, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the drug was determined for the strains most sensitive to pantoprazole. RESULTS: In the unexposed (control) group, nine Lactobacilli strains were affected by pH changes from 6.5 to 4.5. In the group exposed to pantoprazole, 9 of the 19 Lactobacilli strains were found to have an MIC below 625 microg/mL, with L. plantarum 14917 being the most sensitive (MIC = 20 microg/mL). In some strains, such as L. s. salivarius 11741, Gram-staining revealed conformational changes in the bacteria when grown in the presence of pantoprazole. CONCLUSION: Growth rates and morphology of oral Lactobacillus are affected by the pH of the environment. Pantoprazole at supraphysiologic doses further affects growth rates and conformation in some strains. SIGNIFICANCE: The balance of oral flora and upper digestive tract homeostasis may be affected by unexpected targets of PPI pharmacotherapy, with possible unanticipated consequences.
TI  - Bacterial isolates associated with dystocia and retained placenta in iraqi buffaloes.
AB  - The present study was conducted on 50 recently calved Iraqi Buffalo cows. Depending on the kind of parturition, buffalo cows were divided into two main groups, the first group had normal unassisted parturition (NP) (26 animals) and the second group with certain periparturent complications (PPC) (24 animals). After 24 h of parturition, these two groups were further subdivided into two groups as cows expel their foetal membranes in <24 h postpartum and referred as non-retained placenta (NRP) while cows that did not expel their foetal membrane after 24 h referred as retained placenta (RP). Sampling for bacteriology, uterine discharge for polymorphonuclear cells per cent and blood samples for polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) and the enzyme creatine kinase activity were performed at 6, 24 and 48 h postpartum. In PPC group, the most prevalent bacteria after 6 h of calving were Escherichia coli, beta-haemolytic Streptococci and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Total bacterial isolates in the uterus of buffaloes with RP in PPC group after 24 and 48 h were 129 and 183 respectively. Among the isolates, Archanobacterium pyogenes, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Prevotella melaninogenicus and Staphylococcus aureus were the most prevalent isolates after 48 h of RP buffaloes in PPC group. Polymorphonuclear neutrophil were significantly (p < 0.01) increased in the uterine discharge than in blood in buffaloes with RP in both PPC and NP groups. In conclusion, uterine contamination occurs as a result of postpartum ascending contamination by non-specific environmental organisms. The presence of Lactobacillus sp. in the uterus indicated a healthy uterus. Peripartum complications followed by retention of foetal membranes with the dominance of E. coli in the uterine lumen might favour the colonization of other bacteria including facultative anaerobic and strictly anaerobic in the uterine wall of buffaloes.
TI  - Live encapsulated Lactobacillus acidophilus cells in yogurt for therapeutic oral  delivery: preparation and in vitro analysis of alginate-chitosan microcapsules.
AB  - Targeted delivery of live microencapsulated bacterial cells has strong potential  for application in treating various diseases, including diarrhea, kidney failure, liver failure, and high cholesterol, among others. This study investigates the potential of microcapsules composed of two natural polymers, alginate and chitosan (AC), and the use of these artificial cells in yogurt for delivery of probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus bacterial live cells. Results show that the integrity of AC microcapsules was preserved after 76 h of mechanical shaking in MRS broth and after 12 h and 24 h in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. Using an in vitro computer-controlled simulated human gastrointestinal (GI) model, we found 8.37 log CFU/mL of viable bacterial cells were present after 120 min of gastric exposure and 7.96 log CFU/mL after 360 min of intestinal exposure. In addition, AC microcapsules composed of chitosan 10 and 100 at various concentrations were subjected to 4-week storage in 2% milk fat yogurt or 0.85% physiological solution. It was found that 9.37 log CFU/mL of cells encapsulated with chitosan 10 and 8.24 log CFU/mL of cells encapsulated with chitosan 100 were alive after 4 weeks. The AC capsule composed of 0.5% chitosan 10 provided the highest bacterial survival of 9.11 log CFU/mL after 4 weeks. Finally, an investigation of bacterial viability over 72 h in different pH buffers yielded highest survival of 6.34 log CFU/mL and 10.34 log CFU/mL at pH 8 for free and AC-encapsulated cells, respectively. We conclude from these findings that encapsulation allows delivery of a higher number of bacteria to desired targets in the GI tract and that microcapsules containing bacterial cells are good candidates for oral artificial cells for bacterial cell therapy.
TI  - Detoxification of patulin and ochratoxin A, two abundant mycotoxins, by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Aim of the present study was to investigate the detoxification of two abundant mycotoxins, namely ochratoxin A (OTA) and patulin (PAT) which are frequently found in human foods, by lactic acid bacteria. The removal of the two mycotoxins from liquid medium by thirty different LAB strains was analyzed in a screening trial by the use of HPLC coupled with UV- or fluorescence detection. Two highly effective strains were identified; Lactobacillus acidophilus VM 20 caused a decrease of OTA by > or = 95% and Bifidobacterium animalis VM 12 reduced PAT levels by 80%. Subsequently experiments showed that the binding of these compounds depends on different parameters, i.e. the concentration of toxins, the cell density, the pH-value and on the viability of the bacteria. To proof that the decrease of the toxins by LAB from liquid medium results in a reduction of their toxic properties, micronucleus (MCN) assays were conducted with a human derived hepatoma cell line (HepG2). Indeed, a substantial decrease (39-59%) of OTA and PAT induced MCN formation was observed with the most effective strains detected in the chemical analyses. Furthermore, also the inhibition of the cell division rates by the toxins was significantly reduced. These findings indicate that certain LAB strains are able to detoxify the two toxins and may be useful to protect humans and/or animals against the adverse health effects of these compounds.
TI  - Characterization and purification of acidocin 1B, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus GP1B.
AB  - In the present study, acidocin 1B, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus GP1B, exhibited profound inhibitory activity against a variety of LAB and pathogens, including Gram-negative bacteria, and its mode of action was to destabilize the cell wall, thereby resulting in bactericidal lysis. Acidocin 1B was found to be heat stable, because it lost no activity when it was heated up to 95 degrees C for 60 min. It retained approximately 67% of the initial activity after storage for 30 days at 4 degrees C, and 50% of its initial activity after 30 days at 25 degrees C and 37 degrees C. The molecular mass of acidocin 1B was estimated to be 4214.65 Da by mass spectrometry. Plasmid curing results indicated that a plasmid, designated as pLA1B, seemed to be responsible for both acidocin 1B production and host immunity, and that the pLA1B could be transformed into competent cells of L. acidophilus ATCC 43121 by electroporation. Our findings indicate that the acidocin 1B and its producer strain may have potential value as a biopreservative in food systems.
TI  - Effect of dietary inclusion of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 43121 on cholesterol metabolism in rats.
AB  - This study examined the effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 43121 (LAB) on  cholesterol metabolism in hypercholesterolemia-induced rats. Four treatment groups of rats (n = 9) were fed experimental diets: normal diet, normal diet+LAB (2 x 10(6) CFU/day), hypercholesterol diet (0.5% cholesterol, w/w), and hypercholesterol diet + LAB. Body weight, feed intake, and feed efficiency did not differ among the four groups. Supplementation with LAB reduced total serum cholesterol (25%) and VLDL + IDL + LDL cholesterol (42%) in hypercholesterol diet groups, although hepatic tissue cholesterol and lipid contents were not changed. In the normal diet group, cholesterol synthesis (HMG-CoA reductase expression), absorption (LDL receptor expression), and excretion via bile acids (cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase expression) were increased by supplementation with LAB, and increased cholesterol absorption and decreased excretion were found in the hypercholesterol diet group. Total fecal acid sterols excretion was increased by supplementation with LAB. With proportional changes in both normal and hypercholesterol diet groups, primary bile acids (cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids) were reduced, and secondary bile acids (deoxycholic and lithocholic acids) were increased. Fecal neutral sterol excretion was not changed by LAB. In this experiment, the increase in insoluble bile acid (lithocholic acid) reduced blood cholesterol level in rats fed hypercholesterol diets supplemented with LAB. Thus, in the rat, L. acidophilus ATCC 43121 is more likely to affect deconjugation and dehydroxylation during cholesterol metabolism than the assimilation of cholesterol into cell membranes.
TI  - Rapid identification of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in probiotic products using multiplex PCR.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are beneficial for the gastrointestinal tract and reinforce immunity in human health. Recently, many functional products using the lactic acid bacteria have been developed. Among these LAB, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium longum, and Bifidobacterium bifidum are frequently used for probiotic products. In order to monitor these LAB in commercial probiotic products, a multiplex PCR method was developed. We designed four species-specific primer pairs for multiplex PCR from the 16S rRNA, 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region, and 23S rRNA genes in Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium longum, and Bifidobacterium bifidum. Using these primer pairs, 4 different LAB were detected with high specificity in functional foods. We suggest that the multiplex PCR method developed in this study would be an efficient tool for simple, rapid, and reliable identification of LAB used as probiotic strains.
TI  - Characterization of dominant cultivable lactobacilli and their antibiotic resistance profiles from faecal samples of weaning piglets.
AB  - AIMS: To examine the lactic acid bacteria flora of weaning piglets, to define the distribution of different lactobacilli species in piglet faecal samples, and to determine the susceptibility phenotype to 11 antibiotic of different families. METHODS AND RESULTS: The faecal samples were taken from piglets with good herd status at 11 and 28 days after weaning. The Lactobacillus isolates (n = 129) from 78 animals housed in pairs in 39 pens were preliminarily identified by their morphology and biochemical characteristics. Partial 16S ribosomal DNA (16S rDNA) was used to identify the isolates to the species level, and RAPD (randomly amplified polymorphism DNA) profiles to differentiate Lactobacillus isolates to the strain level. Based on these studies, 67 strains were selected for antibiotic resistant tests. The most numerous Lactobacillus species found in the piglets was Lactobacillus reuteri (n = 43). Other lactobacilli were L. salivarius (n = 15), L. agilis (n = 4), L. johnsonii (n = 2), L. vaginalis (n = 1), L. mucosae (n = 1) and L. gallinarum (n = 1). All the strains were susceptible to chloramphenicol, ampicillin and gentamicin. Two L. salivarius isolates and two L. reuteri isolates were found to be multiresistant. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the faecal Lactobacillus flora in piglets consists mainly of L. reuteri, L. salivarius and L. acidophilus group lactobacilli, and the distribution of lactobacilli is similar between individuals of the same age and with the same diet. Most of the Lactobacillus isolates tested were sensitive to the antibiotics used in this study. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Valuable information on Lactobacillus species distribution and their antibiotic resistance profiles in piglets is obtained.
TI  - Prebiotics enhance survival and prolong the retention period of specific probiotic inocula in an in vivo murine model.
AB  - AIM: To identify novel prebiotics that could be used to maintain persistence of three representative probiotic strains in vivo. METHODS AND RESULTS: Test mice were treated with prebiotics soybean oligosaccharide (SOS), fructooligosaccharide (FOS) or inulin, followed by probiotics Lactobacillus acidophilus LAFTI L10 (L10), Bifidobacterium lactis LAFTI B94 (B94) or Lactobacillus casei L26 LAFTI (L26). Faecal samples were then collected and analysed using selective medium and PCR analysis to determine the presence of the probiotic strains. In contrast to the control groups, in mice fed prebiotics, the survival and retention time of the test probiotics was increased extensively. SOS and FOS prolonged the retention period of L10 from 24 to 30 h. Of the three prebiotics, FOS gave the best result with B94, prolonging the retention period from 3 to > or =10 days. Of the three prebiotics, inulin gave the best result for L26, prolonging the retention period from 2 to > or =6 days. CONCLUSIONS: The prebiotics SOS, FOS and inulin significantly enhance survival and prolong the retention period of L10, B94 and L26 in vivo. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our results demonstrate the potential use of FOS, inulin and SOS as prebiotics in conjunction with the probiotic strains L10, B94 and L26 for new synbiotic products.
TI  - Effects of increasing dose of live cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus (Strain  NP 51) combined with a single dose of Propionibacterium freudenreichii (Strain NP 24) on performance and carcass characteristics of finishing beef steers.
AB  - Two experiments, each with a randomized complete block design, were conducted to  evaluate the effects of feeding live cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus plus Propionibacterium freudenreichii on performance and carcass characteristics of feedlot cattle. British and British x Continental steers (240 steers in each experiment; 12 pens/treatment in each study; average initial BW = 370 +/- 6 kg) were fed a 92% concentrate diet based primarily on steam-flaked corn. Four treatments were evaluated, which included a control diet (lactose carrier only) or diets containing 1 x 10(9) cfu/(steer x d) of P. freudenreichii (strain NP 24) with 1 x 10(7) (L), 1 x 10(8) (M), or 1 x 10(9) (H) cfu of L. acidophilus strain NP 51/(steer x d). Data were pooled for the 2 experiments. No differences (P > 0.10) were detected among treatments for final BW, final BW based on HCW, or DMI during various stages of the feeding period or overall. Likewise, no differences among treatments were observed for either ADG or carcass-adjusted ADG (P > 0.10), except for the tendency for a quadratic effect of NP 51 dose for the overall feeding period (P = 0.10), in which cattle fed M had a lower ADG than those fed L and H. Gain efficiency on a live BW basis was improved (P = 0.02) by NP 51 treatments compared with the control, with G:F responding quadratically to NP 51 dose for the overall feeding period (P = 0.05). In contrast to G:F based on live BW, carcass-adjusted G:F tended (P = 0.14) to decrease linearly with increasing NP 51 dose because the dressing percent tended (P = 0.12) to be less for steers fed direct-fed microbial compared with control cattle. Within the direct-fed microbial treatments, there also was a tendency (P = 0.13) for a linear decrease in the dressing percent as the NP 51 dose increased. No differences were observed in other carcass characteristics (P > 0.10), except tendencies for a quadratic increase in marbling score (P = 0.11) and percentage of USDA Choice cattle (P = 0.10). These data indicate that live cultures of L. acidophilus strain NP 51 plus P. freudenreichii strain NP 24 increased G:F of feedlot cattle fed steam-flaked corn-based diets by approximately 2%, but the effects depended on the dose of Lactobacillus.
TI  - Preliminary evidence of the efficacy of probiotic eye-drop treatment in patients  with vernal keratoconjunctivitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics have been shown to improve allergic inflammation. The aim  of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Lactobacillus Acidophilus eye-drops in controlling signs and symptoms of vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC). METHODS: Seven patients (mean age 11.8 +/- 4.3; five M, two F) with mild to moderate VKC were included in the study. Lactobacillus Acidophilus diluted in saline solution (2 x 10(8) CFU/ml) was administrated as eye-drops four times daily for 4 weeks in both eyes. Clinical signs (conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, secretion, Trantas dots, superficial punctuate keratitis) and symptoms (itching, photophobia, burning, tearing) were evaluated and scored from 0 to 3 at baseline, after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. Total sign (TSS) and symptom (TSyS) scores were calculated. Conjunctival impression cytology was performed in three patients at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment, in order to evaluate the expression of ICAM-1 and TLR-4. RESULTS: In the six out of seven patients who completed the study, symptoms were significantly improved after both 2 weeks (TSyS: baseline 6.7 +/- 0.9 vs 4.1 +/- 1.2; p = 0.017) and 4 weeks (TSyS: baseline 6.7 +/- 0.9 vs 3.6 +/- 1.2, p = 0.011) of treatment. A significant improvement of clinical signs was observed after 4 weeks of treatment (TSS: baseline 7.5 +/- 1.6 vs 3.9 +/- 1.7, p = 0.034) but not after 2 weeks of treatment (TSS: baseline 7.5 +/- 1.6 vs 5.3 +/- 1.5; NS). In particular, photophobia was significantly reduced (2 +/- 0.6 vs 1 +/- 0.3; p = 0.023) at 2 weeks, while at 4 weeks the scores for itching (1.8 +/- 0.3 vs 1 +/- 0.3), tearing (1.6 +/- 0.4 vs 0.8 +/- 0.2), conjunctival hyperemia (2.3 +/- 0.2 vs 1.4 +/- 0.5) and chemosis (1.2 +/- 0.4 vs 0.4 +/- 0.4) were significantly lower compared to baseline. A down-regulation of ICAM-1 and TLR-4 was observed in two patients showing clinical improvement after 4 weeks of treatment. CONCLUSION: Our open pilot study showed that 1-month treatment with probiotic eye-drops improves signs and symptoms in patients with VKC. Additional double-blind controlled clinical trials with a larger sample of patients are needed to confirm the effects of topical Lactobacilli on VKC patients.
TI  - Determination of the structure and molecular weights of the exopolysaccharide produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus 5e2 when grown on different carbon feeds.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus 5e2 when grown on skimmed milk, skimmed milk supplemented with sodium formate and skimmed milk supplemented with glucose secretes a branched heteropolysaccharide having a weight average molecular weight less than 450 kDa. The exopolysaccharide has a heptasaccharide repeat unit and is composed of D-glucose, D-galactose and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine in the molar ratio 3:3:1. Using chemical techniques and 1D and 2D-NMR spectroscopy the polysaccharide has been shown to possess the following repeat unit structure:
TI  - Acid, bile, and heat tolerance of free and microencapsulated probiotic bacteria.
AB  - Eight strains of probiotic bacteria, including Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium longum, L. salivarius, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. paracasei, B. lactis type Bl-O4, and B. lactis type Bi-07, were studied for their acid, bile, and heat tolerance. Microencapsulation in alginate matrix was used to enhance survival of the bacteria in acid and bile as well as a brief exposure to heat. Free probiotic organisms were used as a control. The acid tolerance of probiotic organisms was tested using HCl in MRS broth over a 2-h incubation period. Bile tolerance was tested using 2 types of bile salts, oxgall and taurocholic acid, over an 8-h incubation period. Heat tolerance was tested by exposing the probiotic organisms to 65 degrees C for up to 1 h. Results indicated microencapsulated probiotic bacteria survived better (P < 0.05) than free probiotic bacteria in MRS containing HCl. When free probiotic bacteria were exposed to oxgall, viability was reduced by 6.51-log CFU/mL, whereas only 3.36-log CFU/mL was lost in microencapsulated strains. At 30 min of heat treatment, microencapsulated probiotic bacteria survived with an average loss of only 4.17-log CFU/mL, compared to 6.74-log CFU/mL loss with free probiotic bacteria. However, after 1 h of heating both free and microencapsulated probiotic strains showed similar losses in viability. Overall microencapsulation improved the survival of probiotic bacteria when exposed to acidic conditions, bile salts, and mild heat treatment.
TI  - Fermentation of calcium-fortified soymilk with Lactobacillus: effects on calcium  solubility, isoflavone conversion, and production of organic acids.
AB  - The objective of this study was to enhance calcium solubility and bioavailability from calcium-fortified soymilk by fermentation with 7 strains of Lactobacillus, namely, L. acidophilus ATCC 4962, ATCC33200, ATCC 4356, ATCC 4461, L. casei ASCC 290, L. plantarum ASCC 276, and L. fermentum VRI-003. The parameters that were used are viability, pH, calcium solubility, organic acid, and biologically active isoflavone aglycone content. Calcium-fortified soymilk made from soy protein isolate was inoculated with these probiotic strains, incubated for 24 h at 37 degrees C, then stored for 14 d at 4 degrees C. Soluble calcium was measured using atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AA). Organic acids and bioactive isoflavone aglycones, including diadzein, genistein, and glycetein, were measured using HPLC. Viability of the strains in the fermented calcium-fortified soymilk was > 8.5 log(10) CFU/g after 24 h fermentation and this was maintained for 14-d storage at 4 degrees C. After 24 h, there was a significant increase (P < 0.05) in soluble calcium. L. acidophilus ATCC 4962 and L. casei ASCC 290 demonstrated the highest increase with 89.3% and 87.0% soluble calcium after 24 h, respectively. The increase in calcium solubility observed was related to lowered pH associated with production of lactic and acetic acids. Fermentation significantly increased (P < 0.05) the level of conversion of isoflavones into biologically active aglycones, including diadzein, genistein, and glycetein. Our results show that fermenting calcium-fortified soymilk with the selected probiotics can potentially enhance the calcium bioavailability of calcium-fortified soymilk due to increased calcium solubility and bioactive isoflavone aglycone enrichment.
TI  - The immune system in healthy adults and patients with atopic dermatitis seems to  be affected differently by a probiotic intervention.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotic bacteria are proposed to alleviate atopic dermatitis (AD) in infants. There are few indications about the effect of probiotics on AD in adults. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to elucidate the influence of a probiotic drink containing a combination of the probiotics Lactobacillus paracasei Lpc-37, Lactobacillus acidophilus 74-2 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis DGCC 420 (B. lactis 420) in healthy volunteers and in patients with AD on clinical and immunological parameters and their detection in feces. METHODS: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over study was conducted in 15 healthy adults and 15 patients with AD. The probiotic product or placebo was given over 8 weeks. A 2-week washout period was interconnected before the intervention was crossed. At the end of each period, blood and stool samples were collected. In patients, the severity of AD was evaluated using the Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD). RESULTS: L. paracasei and B. lactis were recovered in high numbers in feces after supplementation, whereas L. acidophilus marginally increased. In patients, the SCORAD tended to decrease by 15.5% (P=0.081). Major lymphocyte subsets were not affected by the probiotic intervention. However, CD57(+) increased significantly (P=0.034) in healthy subjects after probiotic intake and was not changed in patients, whereas CD4(+)CD54(+) decreased significantly (P=0.031) in patients with AD and remained uninfluenced in healthy subjects. The expression of CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells was similar in healthy subjects and AD patients. The phagocytic activity of monocytes and granulocytes was significantly increased in healthy subjects after probiotic intervention (P=0.014). CONCLUSION: L. paracasei Lpc-37 and B. lactis 420 are able to colonize the intestine transiently. This study reveals that the probiotics differently modulate peripheral immune parameters in healthy subjects and patients with AD.
TI  - Effect of a fermented milk combining Lactobacillus acidophilus Cl1285 and Lactobacillus casei in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic-associated diarrhea is an important problem in hospitalized patients. The use of probiotics is gaining interest in the scientific community as a potential measure to prevent this complication. The main objective of the present study was to assess the efficacy and safety of a fermented milk combining Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei that is widely available in Canada, in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized study, hospitalized patients were randomly assigned to receive either a lactobacilli-fermented milk or a placebo on a daily basis. RESULTS: Among 89 randomized patients, antibiotic-associated diarrhea occurred in seven of 44 patients (15.9%) in the lactobacilli group and in 16 of 45 patients (35.6%) in the placebo group (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.125 to 0.944; P=0.05). The median hospitalization duration was eight days in the lactobacilli group, compared with 10 days in the placebo group (P=0.09). Overall, the lactobacilli-fermented milk was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: The daily administration of a lactobacilli-fermented milk was safe and effective in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Influence of probiotic Lactobacilli colonization on neonatal B cell responses in  a gnotobiotic pig model of human rotavirus infection and disease.
AB  - The goal of this study was to define the impact of colonization of gnotobiotic (Gn) pigs with lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on development of intestinal and systemic B cell responses to human rotavirus (HRV). The LAB-specific and total B cell responses were also assessed. Gn pigs were inoculated with LAB (Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. reuteri) and virulent Wa strain HRV (LAB+HRV+), HRV only (LAB-HRV+), LAB only (LAB+HRV-) or mock (LAB-HRV-). The HRV infection induced similar HRV-specific intestinal and systemic antibody and B cell responses in pigs with or without LAB, whereas LAB significantly enhanced total intestinal IgA secreting cell responses and total serum IgM and intestinal IgM and IgG titers. The LAB colonization did not reduce HRV shedding or diarrhea, this may be partly due to the short time interval between the first LAB feeding and HRV inoculation. Further studies are needed with longer time for LAB to establish before HRV inoculation. However, our studies demonstrate that Gn pigs infected with HRV develop a similar magnitude of virus-specific B cell responses as those of HRV-infected and LAB colonized pigs. LAB colonization alone is not as efficient in promoting intestinal B cell responses, as is HRV infection.
TI  - Lactic acid bacterial colonization and human rotavirus infection influence distribution and frequencies of monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells in neonatal gnotobiotic pigs.
AB  - Despite accumulating knowledge of porcine macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) from in vitro studies, information regarding monocytes/macrophages and DCs in lymphoid tissues of enteric pathogen-infected neonatal animals in vivo is limited. In this study we evaluated the influence of commensal bacterial [two strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. reuteri] colonization and rotavirus infection on distribution and frequencies of monocytes/macrophages and conventional DCs (cDCs) in ileum, spleen and blood. Gnotobiotic pigs were inoculated with LAB and virulent Wa strain human rotavirus (HRV) (LAB+HRV+), HRV only (LAB-HRV+), LAB only (LAB+HRV-) or mock (LAB-HRV-). The cDCs were characterized as SWC3(+)CD11R1(+), whereas monocytes/macrophages were identified as SWC3(+)CD11R1(-) by flow cytometry in the gnotobiotic pigs at 10 days of age. Infection with HRV alone activated/recruited significantly more monocytes/macrophages to the intestine than LAB colonization and 56% versus 28% of these cells expressed CD14. Colonization with LAB alone also significantly increased the frequencies of monocytes/macrophages and cDCs and the CD14 expression on monocytes/macrophages in ileum and spleen compared to the controls. LAB colonization plus HRV infection significantly reduced macrophage and cDC frequencies in spleen compared to LAB colonization or HRV infection alone, suggesting that LAB colonization down-regulated HRV- infection-induced monocyte/macrophage activation/recruitment at the systemic lymphoid tissue. These results illustrated the distribution of porcine monocytes/macrophages and cDCs and the frequencies of CD14 expression on these cells in intestinal and systemic lymphoid tissues in the early stage of immune responses to intestinal colonization by LAB versus infection by an enteric pathogen HRV and will facilitate further in vivo studies on functional characterization of these immune cells in neonates.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of Lactobacillus species having potential for use  as probiotic cultures for dogs.
AB  - The need to control pathogenic microorganisms in the intestinal tract of dogs is  a growing concern. There is interest in using probiotics such as species of Lactobacillus to help control canine intestinal infections. For successful use as a probiotic, the bacterial species should be of canine intestinal origin since these species exhibit host specificity. Serial dilutions of freshly voided dog feces were plated on Lactobacillus selection (LBS) agar to isolate the cultures. Isolates were identified based on Gram stain, catalase test, and fermentation patterns using API 50 CH kits. All potential isolates were compared for bile resistance based on relative ability to grow in broth containing 0.3% Oxgall, the ability to inhibit Salmonella Typhimurium in associative broth cultures, and the production of reuterin. Of the lactobacilli isolated, Lactobacillus reuteri was the dominant species. However, some cultures of L. acidophilus also were isolated. We found variations among the isolates of L. reuteri and L. acidophilus with respect to bile tolerance. In general, isolates of L. reuteri appeared to be more bile resistant than were isolates of L. acidophilus. There were also variations in the ability to inhibit growth of S. Typhimurium. Some isolates of L. reuteri produced reuterin while others did not.
TI  - Fat-free plain yogurt manufactured with inulins of various chain lengths and Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Inulin is a prebiotic food ingredient that increases the activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus, increases calcium absorption, and is a good source of dietary fiber. The objective was to determine the effect of short, medium, and long chain inulins on the physicochemical, sensory, and microbiological characteristics of fat-free plain yogurt containing L. acidophilus. Inulins of short (P95), medium (GR), and long (HP) chain lengths were incorporated at 1.5% w/w of the yogurt mix. Viscosity, pH, syneresis, sensory properties (flavor, body and texture, and appearance and color), L. acidophilus counts, and color (L*, a*, and b*) of yogurts were determined at 1, 11, and 22 d after yogurt manufacture. The P95 containing yogurt had a significantly lower pH than the remaining yogurts, higher flavor scores than the yogurt containing HP, and comparable flavor scores with the control. The yogurts containing HP had less syneresis than the control and a better body and texture than the remaining yogurts. Yogurts containing prebiotics of different chain lengths had comparable L. acidophilus counts with each other but higher counts than the control. However, inulins of various chain lengths did not affect viscosity, color, and product appearance. Chain length of prebiotics affected some quality attributes of probiotic yogurts.
TI  - Incorporation of citrus fibers in fermented milk containing probiotic bacteria.
AB  - The incorporation of Lactobacillus acidophilus CECT 903, Lactobacillus casei CECT 475 and Bifidobacterium bifidum CECT 870 together with lemon (LF) and orange (OF) fibers obtained from juice by-products were tested in (i) a model system: fiber enriched with de Man Rogosa Sharp (MRS) broth cultured with each probiotic bacteria and (ii) evaluation of populations of probiotic bacteria in fermented milks formulated with citrus fibers. Citrus fibers enhanced L. acidophilus CECT 903, and L. casei CECT 475 survival in MRS during refrigerated storage, whereas erratic results were obtained for B. bifidum CECT 870, OF enhanced its growth and LF had inhibitory effect. Populations of probiotic bacteria decreased with storage time in MRS broth. The presence of yogurt starter bacteria in probiotic fermented milks favored the growth and survival of L. acidophilus and B. bifidum. Citrus fiber presence in fermented milks also enhanced bacterial growth and survival of the tested probiotic bacteria. This study indicates that citrus fiber enriched fermented milk have good acceptability and are good vehicles for a variety of commercial probiotics but survival of B. bifidum will need to be improved.
TI  - Effect of a probiotic mixed culture on texture profile and sensory performance of Minas fresh cheese in comparison with the traditional products.
AB  - The effect of a mixed probiotic culture on instrumental texture, and on sensorial and related properties of Minas fresh cheese during refrigerated storage was investigated. Three cheese-making trials were prepared: T1, with the traditional type O starter culture (Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis + L. lactis subsp. cremoris), T2 with only lactic acid and T3, with lactic acid and the probiotic ABT culture (Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 + Bifidobacterium animalis Bb-12 + Streptococcus thermophilus). Instrumental texture profile analysis and related properties were monitored during storage for up to 21 days. Lb. acidophilus and B. animalis were present in high levels throughout storage of cheeses T3, above 6 log cfu.g(-1), threshold required for probiotic activity, and stimulation of the La-5 growth was observed. Cheeses with added probiotic ABT culture, as well as those made adding lactic acid only, showed to be less brittle and with more favorable sensorial features, due to higher pH values. Results indicated that the use of probiotic ABT culture complementary to lactic acid for the purpose of substituting the type O (Lc. lactis subsp. lactis + Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris) culture, traditionally employed for Minas cheese production, is advantageous.
TI  - Gene expression profiling of chicken lymphoid cells after treatment with Lactobacillus acidophilus cellular components.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus has been shown to exert immunostimulating activities in a number of species, including the chicken. To examine the molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon, we investigated spatial and temporal expression of immune system genes in chicken cecal tonsil and spleen mononuclear cells in response to structural constituents of L. acidophilus. Using a low-density chicken immune system microarray, we found that cecal tonsil cells responded more rapidly than spleen cells to the bacterial stimuli, with the most potent stimulus for cecal tonsil cells being DNA and for splenocytes being the bacterial cell wall components. We also discovered that in both splenocytes and cecal tonsil cells, STAT2 and STAT4 genes were highly induced. Given the close interactions between cecal tonsil cells and commensal bacteria, we further examined the involvement of STAT2 and STAT4 signaling pathways in cellular responses to bacterial DNA. Our results revealed that the expression of STAT2, STAT4, IL-18, MyD88, IFN-alpha, and IFN-gamma genes were up-regulated in cecal tonsil cells after treatment with L. acidophilus DNA.
TI  - Effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus strain L-55 on experimental allergic rhinitis in BALB/c mice.
AB  - We investigated the effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus strain L-55 isolated from infant feces on experimental allergic rhinitis in BALB/c mice. The heat-treated cells of strain L-55 were orally administrated for 4 consecutive weeks to mice sensitized by ovalbumin (OVA), and nasal symptoms (sneezing and nasal rubbing) induced by OVA challenge were evaluated. Strain L-55 at doses of 1 and 10 mg cells/mouse significantly inhibited nasal symptoms by repeated administration over a period of 2 weeks. Furthermore, we measured the level of OVA-specific IgE titers in the serum by passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) reaction. PCA titers in the sera from mice administrated strain L-55 were significantly lowered compared with the control. These results suggest that oral administration of strain L-55 may be useful for alleviating the nasal symptoms of allergic rhinitis.
TI  - Relationship between early intestinal colonization, mucosal immunoglobulin A production and systemic immune development.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Variations in early intestinal colonization patterns have been implicated in the predispostion to allergic disease through effects on mucosal and systemic immune function. METHODS: Colonization patterns and mucosal IgA production at 6 months of age were examined in relation to early exposures, systemic immune development and early allergic outcomes. This was performed in a cohort (n=189) who had received either Lactobacillus acidophilus or a placebo since birth. RESULTS: Children who developed sensitization to one or more allergens by 12 months of age had significantly higher total (but not secretory) IgA levels at 6 months (P=0.024), but this was independent of probiotic treatment. There were no relationships between colonization patterns and IgA (total or secretory IgA) levels or allergic outcomes (sensitization, atopic dermatitis or food allergies). Breastfeeding, and the use of yoghurt or probiotic supplements were independently associated with significantly higher proportions of 'favourable' lactobacilli and bifidobacteria species. Caesarean delivery and the use of antibiotics during the first 6 months were not associated with significant variations in colonization. Higher proportions of 'favourable' bacteria (notably bifidobacteria) were associated with reduced production of most cytokine response to allergens, but increased expression of regulatory cell markers (P=0.009) and transforming growth factor-beta (P=0.016). CONCLUSION: 'Favourable' colonization, particularly with bifidobacteria, was associated with effects on cellular immune function, but this was not associated with mucosal immunity (secretory IgA) or reduced risk of allergic disease.
TI  - Reduction of Escherichia coli O157 and Salmonella in feces and on hides of feedlot cattle using various doses of a direct-fed microbial.
AB  - In this study, the effectiveness of direct-fed microbials at reducing Escherichia coli O157 and Salmonella in beef cattle was evaluated. Steers (n=240) received one of the following four treatment concentrations: control = lactose carrier only; low = 1 X 10(7) CFU per steer daily Lactobacillus acidophilus NP51; medium = 5 x 10(8) CFU per steer daily L. acidophilus NP51; and high = 1 x 10(9) CFU per steer daily L. acidophilus NP51. Low, medium, and high diets also included 1 x 10(9) CFU per steer Propionibacterium freudenreichii NP24. Feces were collected from each animal at allocation of treatment and found to have no variation (P = 0.54) between cohorts concerning E. coli O157 recovery. Feces and hide swabs were collected at harvest and analyzed for the presence of E. coli O157 by immunomagnetic separation and Salmonella by PCR. No significant dosing effects were detected for E. coli O157 recovery from feces at the medium dose or from hides at the medium and high doses. E. coli O157 was 74% (P < 0.01) and 69% (P < 0.01) less likely to be recovered in feces from animals receiving the high and low diets, respectively, compared with controls. Compared with controls, E. coli O157 was 74% (P = 0.05) less likely to be isolated on hides of cattle receiving the low dose. No significant dosing effects were detected for Salmonella recovery from feces at the medium and low doses or from hides at any doses. Compared with controls, Salmonella was 48% (P = 0.09) less likely to be shed in feces of cattle receiving the high dose. No obvious dose-response of L. acidophilus NP51 on recovery of E. coli O157 or Salmonella was detected in our study.
TI  - A probiotic Lactobacillus strain can acquire vancomycin resistance during digestive transit in mice.
AB  - The present study demonstrates for the first time the transfer of vancomycin resistance (vanA cluster) from enterococci to a Lactobacillusacidophilus commercial strain. Transfers were observed in vitro, but also in vivo in the gut of mice (in the absence of antibiotic pressure) where transconjugants arose at relatively high frequencies and could persist in the digestive environment. Since transfer of vancomycin resistance genes might also take place in the human digestive tract, lactobacilli probiotics should be carefully considered especially in either immunocompromised patients or during antibiotherapy. Acquisition and retransfer of resistance genes should be addressed in the safety evaluation of probiotics.
TI  - Lactobacillus rhamnosus R11 consumed in a food supplement survived human digestive transit without modifying microbiota equilibrium as assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the survival of Lactobacillus rhamnosus R11 and Lactobacillus acidophilus R52 in the human digestive tract and their effects on the microbiota homeostasis. We designed an open human trial including 14 healthy volunteers. A 3-week exclusion period of fermented products was followed by a 12-day consumption period of 4 capsules daily containing 2 x 10(9)L. rhamnosus R11 and 1 x 10(8)L. acidophilus R52, and a 12-day wash-out period. The 2 strains and dominant bacterial groups of the microbiota were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. At the end of the capsule consumption period, high levels of L. rhamnosus R11 were detected in faecal samples from all volunteers, reaching a mean value of 7.1 log(10) colony-forming unit (CFU) equivalents/g of stool. L. acidophilus R52 was detected in the stools of only 1 volunteer, reaching a maximum level of 6.1 log(10) CFU equivalents/g of stool. Dilution plating enumerations performed in parallel provided less consistent and generally lower levels. No significant effect of capsule consumption was observed on microbiota homeostasis for the dominant faecal populations. Mean values of 8.8, 9.2, 9.9 and 10.6 log(10) CFU equivalents/g of stool were obtained for the Clostridium coccoides, Bifidobacterium sp., Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium leptum groups, respectively.
TI  - Identification of an operon and inducing peptide involved in the production of lactacin B by Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - AIM: To determine if a 9.5-kb region on the Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM genome, encoded the genetic determinants for regulation and production of lactacin B, a class II bacteriocin. METHODS: Transcriptional analysis was used to identify a 9.5-kb polycistronic region suspected of encoding the lab operon. The 12 putative open reading frames (LBA1803-LBA1791) were organized into three clusters: a production and regulation cluster encoding a putative two-component signal transduction system; an export cluster encoding a putative ABC transporter and a final cluster composed of three unknown proteins. Seven genes were typical of bacteriocins, encoding small, cationic peptides, each with an N-terminal double-glycine leader motif. Inactivation of a predicted ABC transporter completely abolished bacteriocin activity. When cloned and expressed together, LBA1803-LBA1800 resulted in markedly higher levels of lactacin B activity. The four peptides were chemically synthesized but exhibited no bacteriocin activity, alone or in combination. Only LBA1800 induced lactacin B production in broth cultures. CONCLUSIONS: Lactacin B production is encoded within the 9.5-kb lab operon of 12 genes that are transcribed in a single transcript. LBA1800 is an inducing peptide of bacteriocin production. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: A three-component regulatory system common to class II bacteriocins regulates the production of this bacteriocin by Lact. acidophilus.
TI  - Hydrolysis of whey proteins by Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus grown in a chemically defined medium.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the ability of themophilic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to hydrolyse the whey proteins beta-lactoglobulin (BLG) and alpha-lactalbumin (ALA) in a chemically defined medium (CDM). METHODS AND RESULTS: The ability of three LAB strains to hydrolyse BLG and ALA was studied in a CDM supplemented with these proteins or whey protein concentrate (WPC). Protein hydrolysis was determined by Tricine/SDS-PAGE and RP-HPLC. Maximum BLG (21%) and ALA (26%) degradation by LAB was observed using WPC. Under starving conditions, BLG degradation was greater for Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus CRL 454 than for Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 636 and Streptococcus thermophilus CRL 804. All three strains showed different peptide profiles and were not able to hydrolyse ALA under starvation. CONCLUSIONS: The assayed LAB strains were able to degrade BLG during growth in a CDM and under starving conditions. The different peptide profiles obtained indicate distinct protease specificities. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These strains could be used as adjunct cultures to increase BLG digestibility in whey-based or whey-containing foods. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the ability of a Lact. acidophilus strain to degrade BLG.
TI  - Oxalate consumption by lactobacilli: evaluation of oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase and formyl-CoA transferase activity in Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - AIMS: This study was undertaken to evaluate the oxalate-degrading activity in several Lactobacillus species widely used in probiotic dairy and pharmaceutical preparations. Functional characterization of oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase and formyl-CoA transferase in Lactobacillus acidophilus was performed in order to assess the possible contribution of Lactobacillus in regulating the intestinal oxalate homeostasis. METHODS AND RESULTS: In order to determine the oxalate-degrading ability in 60 Lactobacillus strains belonging to 12 species, a screening was carried out by using an enzymatic assay. A high variability in the oxalate-degrading capacity was found in the different species. Strains of Lact. acidophilus and Lactobacillus gasseri showed the highest oxalate-degrading activity. Oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase and formyl-CoA transferase genes from Lact. acidophilus LA14 were cloned and sequenced. The activity of the recombinant enzymes was assessed by capillary electrophoresis. CONCLUSIONS: Strains of Lactobacillus with a high oxalate-degrading activity were identified. The function and significance of Lact. acidophilus LA14 oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase and formyl-CoA transferase in oxalate catabolism were demonstrated. These results suggest the potential use of Lactobacillus strains for the degradation of oxalate in the human gut. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Identification of probiotic strains with oxalate-degrading activity can offer the opportunity to provide this capacity to individuals suffering from an increased body burden of oxalate and oxalate-associated disorders.
TI  - An ecological study of lactic acid bacteria from Almagro eggplant fermentation brines.
AB  - AIM: Identification of the predominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) involved in spontaneous fermentations of Almagro eggplants, and evaluation of the biodiversity by molecular typing. METHODS AND RESULTS: Almagro eggplant fermentations in three factories (A, B and C) enjoying Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status were monitored by chemical and microbiological analysis of brines. LAB isolates from brines were identified by phenotypic analysis and by species-specific PCR reactions and typed by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR. All isolates from factories A and C belonged to the genus Lactobacillus (Lact.), whereas isolates from factory B belonged to Lactobacillus (50%), Leuconostoc (Ln.) (25%) and Lactococcus (Lc.) (25%); 1.9% of this microbiota was considered cosmopolitan. The genera Leuconostoc and Lactococcus and the species Lact. acidophilus and Lact. paracasei had never previously been reported in Almagro eggplant fermentations. CONCLUSION: Considerable differences in the composition of the lactic acid microbiota participating in the Almagro eggplant fermentations exist. Brine NaCl concentration has a notable influence both in number and in the species participating. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The original aspect of this work consists of an ecological study of the LAB taking part in spontaneous Almagro eggplant fermentations from different factories. Participation of Leuconostoc and Lactococcus species and of Lact. acidophilus and Lact. paracasei, which had never before been described for this pickle, and the evidence that a lactic fermentation does not always take place, were the most relevant results.
TI  - [Effects of Lactobacilli on regulating NF-kappaB activation and IL-8 secretion in SGC7901 cell impacted by Helicobacter pylori].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In vitro to investigate the regulation effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC4356 and L. bulgaricus (LB) on the activation of NF-kB and IL-8 secretion of SGC7901 cell, which Helicobacter pylori induced. METHODS: SGC7901 cell was cultured to reach the exponential growth phase, then adjusted to cell concentration (2.5 x 10(5)/mL), and planted into six shadow mask and incubated for 24 hours. Until reaching exponential growth phase, the cultured ATCC4356 and LB were adjusted to different concentration to incubation with SGC7901 cell together for one hour, and then added H. pylori into them for culturing 3 hours. For the contrast analysis of result, the experiment subgroups were designed as follow: normal control, H. pylori stimulating group (H. pylori group), ATCC4356 intervention group (ATCC4356 group) and LB intervention group (LB group). The nuclear factor-kB of SGC7901 cell was detected by immunohistochemistry. The release of IL-8 in cells was detected by ELISA. RESULTS: The percentage of NF-kB p65 positive nuclei-stained cell and the secreting level of IL-8 from cells in H. pylori group significantly increased compared with those in control group (P < 0.01). When the Lactobacillus concentration was 3 x 10(6) cfu/mL, 3 x 10(7) cfu/mL and 3 x 10(8) cfu/mL respectively, the percentage of NF-kB p65 positive nuclei-stained cell of ATCC4356 group was significantly decreased compared with that of H. pylori group (P < 0.01). When the Lactobacillus concentration was 3 x 10(6) cfu/ mL and 3 x 10(7) cfu/mL respectively, the IL-8 secretory volume of cells of ATCC4356 group could be significantly decreased compared with that of H. pylori group (P < 0.01). When the Lactobacillus concentration was 3 x 10(6) cfu/ mL, 3 x 10(7) cfu/mL and 3 x 10(8) cfu/mL respectively, the percentage of NF-kB p65 positive nuclei-stained cell of LB group was significantly decreased compared with that of H. pylori group (P < 0.05). When the Lactobacillus concentration was 3 x 10(7) cfu/mL or 3 x 10(8) cfu/mL respectively, the cell IL-8 secretory volume of LB group was significantly decreased compared with that of H. pylori group (P < 0.05). However, if the level of Lactobacillus concentration showed too high, the ATCC4356 and LB might have no above mentioned inhibitory action, the percentage of NF-kB p65 positive nuclei-stained cell and the level of IL-8 secretion of cells in those experiment groups significantly increased compared with those in H. pylori group. CONCLUSION: In some concentration range, both ATCC4356 and LB can inhibit the cell inflammatory reaction induced by H. pylori, but if the concentration is too high, they may make the inflammatory reaction become more serious. These can explain in partial why lactobacillus as primary common bacterium maintains the proper proportion concentration is very important for the keeping on microecological balance in stomach.
TI  - Comparison of antibacterial properties of two fluoride-releasing and a nonfluoride-releasing pit and fissure sealants.
AB  - Occlusal pits and fissures are the most susceptible sites for the development of  dental caries and prevention is difficult in the areas of occurrence. Although only 12.5% of all the tooth surfaces are occlusal, these surfaces develop more than two-thirds of total caries experienced by children. The fate of the bacteria is of significance when they are inadvertently sealed by a dental sealant. This study aimed in examining the antibacterial properties of three commercially available sealants, viz., Teethmate-F, Helioseal-F and Helioseal. Antibacterial testing was done by disc diffusion method. Selective agars were used to grow Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of dental caries. Statistical analysis was carried out using student's t test. The study proved that Helioseal-F and Helioseal did not possess antibacterial properties and Teethmate-F was the only sealant that showed antibacterial properties.
TI  - Pediatric applications of inulin and oligofructose.
AB  - Inulin-type fructans have been used in infants and children because of their prebiotic potential to modulate the intestinal flora and influence the innate and adaptive immune response favorably. A mixture of long chain inulin (5-60 monomers) in combination with galactooligosaccharides (GOS) (2-7 monomers) has been added to infant formula in Europe in a 10-90% ratio for over 5 y. Clinical studies have demonstrated that these prebiotic formulas have significant effects on flora composition, improve stool consistency, decrease intestinal permeability, and reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) and respiratory infections and atopic dermatitis. Oligofructose in weaning foods consumed by toddlers increases fecal Bifidobacteria counts and decreases fecal Clostridia counts during consumption, leading to softer stools and fewer fever episodes and other GI symptoms. Synergy, a mixture of oligofructose and long chain inulin, is protective of the Bifidus flora during amoxicillin treatment. Few studies are available in adolescents. Calcium absorption is improved especially by Synergy. The same product, combined with Lactobacillus Rhamnosus and Acidophilus, induces significantly favorable effects on colonic ammonia (NH3) metabolism. The demonstrated bifidogenic effect of inulin and oligofructose on intestinal microbiota is probably not the only mechanism involved but may be the key to important immune mediated effects.
TI  - Molecular characterization of antimicrobial compound produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus AA11.
AB  - Approximately 63 strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus were isolated from Egyptian home-made cheese and examined for production of antagonism. Only eight strains demonstrated inhibitory activity against spoilage microorganisms (i.e. Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus) and pathogens (i.e. E. coli, Salmonella sp. and Shigella sp.). Lactobacillus acidophilus AA11 produced higher antimicrobial activity with a wide range of inhibition. The agent AA11 was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and retained full activity after 30 min at 100 degrees C. Activity against sensitive cells was bactericidal but not bacteriolytic. The compound was produced during growth phase and could be extracted from the culture supernatant fluids with n-butanol. 12% SDS-PAGE analysis of 40% ammonium sulphate precipitated agent showed two peptides with molecular weights of approximately 36 kDa and approximately 29 kDa. No plasmid was identified in Lactobacillus acidophilus AA11 indicating that the genes encoding the inhibitory agent were located on the chromosome. These characteristics identify the inhibitory substance as a bacteriocin, designated acidocin AA11 and confer the agent an application potential as a biopreservative.
TI  - Murine immunomodulation of IL-10 and IL-12 induced by new isolates from avian type 2 Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Several bacterial and immunogenic factors are involved in the host response to probiotic strains of Lactobacillus. Here, we report the isolation of new intestinal lactobacilli from chicken, with different immunomodulating properties on lymphoid cells from SJL and C57BL/6 mice. Analysis of biochemical markers in the Lactobacillus acidophilus CBA4P, CBA3P, and TPA3P isolates reveal that these bacterial isolates belong to the type 2 prototype, although they differ from each other. The effect of conditioned media (CM) from SJL- and C57BL/6-derived peritoneal macrophages incubated with the 3 sonicated bacterial isolates from chicken, as well as with Lactobacillus rhamnosus 9595, Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, or Staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan were compared. Our results show that the CM of macrophages from C57BL/6 and SJL mice treated with the CBA4P isolate stimulated syngeneic splenic lymphocytes at a level similar to the one induced with CM from peptidoglycan-stimulated macrophages. In contrast, the CM from TPA3P- and CBA3P-treated macrophages promoted low or no stimulation of lymphoid cells. Incubation of splenic cells with CM from macrophages treated with L. rhamnosus or TPA3P led to a relative decrease in the percentages of splenic CD4+ T cells, whereas the relative percentages of B cells increased. The CBA4P and CBA3P isolates induced higher levels of gamma interferon when compared with the TPA3P isolate. The effects of the lactobacilli isolates differed according to the mouse strain used but correlated with the production of macrophagic tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukins 6, 10, and 12 and with the modulation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Taken together, these results indicate that the immunomodulating properties of the new L. acidophilus isolates depend on their capacity to induce production of interleukins 10 and 12 by macrophages, which is under genetic control and depends on the p38 MAPK pathway.
TI  - Endogenous beta-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase activities from selected probiotic micro-organisms and their role in isoflavone biotransformation in soymilk.
AB  - AIM: To compare endogenous beta-glucosidases and beta-galactosidases for hydrolysis of the predominant isoflavone glycosides into isoflavone aglycones in order to improve biological activity of soymilk. METHODS AND RESULTS: beta-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase activities of probiotic organisms including Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4461, Lactobacillus casei 2607 and Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis Bb12 in soymilk were evaluated and correlated with the increase in concentration of isoflavone aglycones during fermentation. The concentrations of isoflavone compounds in soymilk were monitored using a Varian model high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with an amperometric electrochemical detector. In all micro-organisms, beta-glucosidase activity was found greater than that of beta-galactosidase. There was an increase in the aglycone concentration with incubation time because of the apparent hydrolytic action on isoflavone glycosides. Aglycone concentration in the soymilk with L. acidophilus 4461, L. casei 2607 and B. animalis ssp. lactis Bb12, increased by 5.37-, 5.52- and 6.10-fold, respectively, after 15 h of fermentation at 37 degrees C. The maximum hydrolytic potential was also observed at 15 h of fermentation for the three micro-organims coinciding with peak activities of the two enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: beta-glucosidase activity was more than 15 times higher than beta-galactosidase activity in soymilk for each of the micro-organisms during fermentation. beta-glucosidase played a greater role in isoflavone glycoside hydrolysis. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Screening for beta-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase activities among probiotics in soymilk is important for the improvement of biological activity of soymilk and in the selection of micro-organisms for use in the growing industry of functional foods and beverages.
TI  - A comparative study of the preventative effects exerted by three probiotics, Bifidobacterium lactis, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus, in the TNBS model of rat colitis.
AB  - AIMS: The intestinal anti-inflammatory effects of three probiotics with immunomodulatory properties, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis, were evaluated and compared in the trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS) model of rat colitis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Colitis was induced in rats by intracolonic administration of 10 mg of TNBS dissolved in 0.25 ml of 50% ethanol. Each probiotic was administered orally (5x10(8) CFU suspended in 0.5 ml of skimmed milk) for 3 weeks, starting 2 weeks before the administration of TNBS. Colonic damage was evaluated histologically and biochemically 1 week after TNBS instillation. The results obtained revealed that all probiotics assayed showed intestinal anti-inflammatory effects, macroscopically evidenced by a significant reduction in the colonic weight/length ratio. Only B. lactis showed a lower incidence of diarrhoea in comparison with untreated rats. Biochemically, all probiotics restored colonic glutathione levels, depleted as a consequence of the oxidative stress of the inflammatory process. Bifidobacterium lactis treatment reduced colonic tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha production, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression; L. acidophilus administration reduced colonic leukotriene B4 production and iNOS expression and L. casei intake was associated with a decrease in colonic COX-2 expression. CONCLUSION: The three probiotics assayed have shown intestinal anti-inflammatory activity in the TNBS model of rat colitis, although each probiotic shows its own anti-inflammatory profile. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These probiotics could be considered as potential adjuvants in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, although more studies are required in order to demonstrate their efficacy in humans.
TI  - Study on beta-galactosidase enzymatic activity of herbal yogurt.
AB  - Different types of herbal yogurts were developed by mixing standardized milk with pretreated herbs, namely tulsi leaf (Ocimum sanctum), pudina leaf (Mentha arvensis) and coriander leaf (Coriandrum sativum), with leaves separately and a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of the strains of lactic starter cultures---Lactobacillus acidophilus (NCIM 2903) and Lactobacillus plantarum (NCIM 2083)-followed by incubation at 40 degrees C for 6 h. The beta-galactosidase enzymatic activity of the abovementioned herbal yogurts was determined and interestingly noted to exhibit higher enzymatic activity compared with the control yogurt (without any herbs). Among all herbal yogurts, tulsi yogurt had the maximum beta-galactosidase activity.
TI  - [Evaluation of the effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus probiotic culture added to yogurt over Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella enteritidis populations].
AB  - The effect of different types of probiotics present in yogurt over known populations of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella enteritidis was evaluated. The three types of yogurt used were: without added probiotics, with added probiotics (Lactobacillus casei CRL_431 and L. acidophilus CRL_730 CHR HANSEN) and another one with the same probiotics mentioned above and Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LR-35) culture. About 10(9) CFU/ mL of each potentially pathogenic bacteria was added to each type of yogurt tested, and kept in refrigeration at 4 degrees C during its shelf life, about 30 days. Bacterial count was done the initial day and every four days. Results obtained show that there is a difference in the inhibition between yogurts without added probiotics and the commercial yogurt with added probiotics; there is a clear inhibitory effect of the last one over S. aureus, E. coli O157:H7 and Listeria monocytogenes. The yogurt with added probiotics and L. rhamnosus did not show any additional inhibitory effect over the bacteria tested when compared with the yogurt with added probiotics. S. enteritidis could not be evaluated because it was not detectable in any yogurt samples evaluated four days after its inoculation. This study confirms the antagonic effect of probiotic cultures over potentially pathogenic bacteria for human beings and animals that may be present in food. Nevertheless, the use of L. rhamnosus did not produce any additional inhibitory effect.
TI  - Pre-harvest interventions to reduce the shedding of E. coli O157 in the faeces of weaned domestic ruminants: a systematic review.
AB  - Our objective was to use formal systematic review methods to evaluate the efficacy of interventions to reduce faecal shedding of Escherichia coli O157 in post-weaned ruminants by increasing animal resistance. The methodology consisted of an extensive search to identify all potentially relevant research, screening of titles and abstracts for relevance to the research question, quality assessment of relevant research, extraction of data from research of sufficient quality, and qualitative summarization of results. The interventions evaluated included probiotics, vaccination, antimicrobials, sodium chlorate, bacteriophages and other feed additives. There was evidence of efficacy for the probiotic combination Lactobacillus acidophilus NP51 (NPC 747) and Propionibacterium freudenreichii and for sodium chlorate in feed or water. The effectiveness of vaccination varied among studies and among vaccine protocols and there was no consistent evidence to suggest that antibiotic use was associated with a decrease in faecal shedding of E. coli O157, or that current industry uses of antimicrobials were associated with increased faecal shedding. There were an insufficient number of studies available to address the effectiveness of bacteriophages and several other feed additives. In general, few of the primary studies evaluated the interventions under commercial housing conditions with a natural disease challenge, there were inconsistencies in the results among study designs and in some cases among studies within study designs, and a relatively large proportion of publications were excluded based on quality assessment criteria. Few studies reported on associations between the proposed intervention and production parameters, such as average daily gain and feed: gain ratio. While the results suggest that some interventions may be efficacious, there are knowledge gaps in our understanding of the efficacy of pre-harvest interventions to increase animal resistance to E. coli O157 that require further targeted research.
TI  - An experimental study and a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the antisecretory activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LB against nonrotavirus diarrhea.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have shown that selected strains of Lactobacillus have the capacity to antagonize rotavirus-induced diarrhea. However, only a few reports have documented their efficacy against nonrotavirus diarrhea. This study involved an experimental investigation and a clinical trial of the antisecretory activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LB in the context of nonrotavirus diarrhea. METHODS: The activity of a culture of L. acidophilus LB or of the lyophilized, heat-killed L. acidophilus LB bacteria plus their spent culture medium was tested in inhibiting the formation of fluid-formed domes in cultured human intestinal Caco-2/TC7 cell monolayers infected with diarrheagenic, diffusely adhering Afa/Dr Escherichia coli C1845 bacteria. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of male or female children who were 10 months of age and presented with nonrotavirus, well-established diarrhea was conducted to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of a pharmaceutical preparation that contains 10 billion heat-killed L. acidophilus LB plus 160 mg of spent culture medium. RESULTS: Infection of the cells with C1845 bacteria that were treated with L. acidophilus LB culture or the lyophilized, heat-killed L. acidophilus LB bacteria plus their culture medium produced a dosage-dependent decrease in the number of fluid-formed domes as compared with cells that were infected with untreated C1845 bacteria. The clinical results show that in selected and controlled homogeneous groups of children with well-established, nonrotavirus diarrhea, adding lyophilized, heat-killed L. acidophilus LB bacteria plus their culture medium to a solution of oral rehydration solution shortened by 1 day the recovery time (ie, the time until the first normal stool was passed) as compared with children who received placebo oral rehydration solution. CONCLUSIONS: Heat-killed L. acidophilus LB plus its culture medium antagonizes the C1845-induced increase in paracellular permeability in intestinal Caco-2/TC7 cells and produces a clinically significant benefit in the management of children with nonrotavirus, well-established diarrhea.
TI  - Stability of microencapsulated B. lactis (BI 01) and L. acidophilus (LAC 4) by complex coacervation followed by spray drying.
AB  - Microcapsules containing Bifidobacterium lactis (BI 01) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (LAC 4) were produced by complex coacervation using a casein/pectin complex as the wall material, followed by spray drying. The aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of these microorganisms when submitted to the spray drying process, a shelf-life of 120 days at 7-37 degrees C and the in vitro tolerance after being submitted to acid pH (pH 1.0 and 3.0) solutions besides morphology of microcapsules. Microencapsulated microorganisms were shown to be more resistant to acid conditions than free ones. Microencapsulated L. acidophilus maintained its viability for a longer storage period at both temperatures. The microcapsules presented a spherical shape with no fissures. The process used and the wall material were efficient in protecting the microorganisms under study against the spray drying process and simulated gastric juice; however, microencapsulated B. lactis lost its viability before the end of the storage time.
TI  - The impact of a low-frequency chlorhexidine rinsing schedule on the subgingival microbiota (the TEETH clinical trial).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Information on the efficacy of chlorhexidine (CHX) rinsing on the subgingival microbiota is limited. This study tested if intermittent CHX rinsing over 5 years had an impact on the subgingival microbiota. METHODS: Subgingival plaque samples were analyzed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method in a double-blind randomized CHX rinse study. RESULTS: A total of 210 subjects were included. The mean age of the subjects was 71.7 (+/- 4.1) years, and 56.2% were women. Evidence of alveolar bone loss was found in 39% of subjects. Bacterial loads were not correlated significantly with probing depth. At year 5, subjects in the CHX rinse group with no evidence of bone loss presented with lower total bacterial counts than control subjects with no bone loss. The levels of the following bacteria were significantly lower in the CHX group: Lactobacillus acidophilus (P <0.05), Eikenella corrodens (P <0.05), Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum (P <0.01), Treponema denticola (P <0.05), Leptotrichia buccalis (P <0.05), and Eubacterium saburreum (P <0.05). No differences in bacterial loads were found between CHX and control rinse subjects with alveolar bone loss. CONCLUSIONS: Older subjects with or without periodontitis carry a large variety of bacteria associated with periodontitis. Intermittent rinsing with CHX may provide a preventive benefit in reducing levels of bacteria but only in subjects without alveolar bone loss.
TI  - Are probiotics detectable in human feces after oral uptake by healthy volunteers?
AB  - GOALS: Assessment of the presence of probiotic bacteria in feces after oral ingestion. BACKGROUND: Probiotic bacteria are said to have beneficial effects on the host. As a precondition for any effect, probiotic strains must survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract. STUDY: The feces of seven volunteers were analyzed for the presence of probiotic strains after one week's oral ingestion of each of six commercially available products: E. coli Nissle 0.5-5 x 10(9) cells (Mutaflor), Enterococcus faecium SF 68 7.5 x 10(7) cells (Bioflorin), Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium infantis both 1 x 10(9) cells (Infloran), Lactobacillus gasseri and Bifidobacterium longum both 1 x 10(8) cells (Omniflora), Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus 1 x 10(9) cells (Antibiophilus), and yoghurt enriched with Lactobacillus casei Immunitas 1 x 10(10) cells (Actimel). Ten colonies were selected from each stool sample, and DNA was extracted and typed using random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Typing patterns of the ingested probiotics and the fecal isolates were compared. RESULTS: Fingerprints identical to the ingested probiotic strains were recovered from fecal samples of 4/7 volunteers after one week of Mutaflor, from 4/6 after taking Bioflorin, and from 1/6 after Infloran. Cultivation of strains of the same species from fecal specimens was negative after consumption of Antibiophilus, Omniflora and Actimel. CONCLUSIONS: After oral consumption of probiotics, E. coli and enterococci could be detected in stool samples (57% and 67%, respectively). In contrast, with only one exception, ingested lactobacilli and bifidobacteria could not be detected in human feces.
TI  - Randomized control trial of live Lactobacillus acidophilus plus Bifidobacterium infantis in treatment of infantile acute watery diarrhea.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of live Lactobacillus acidophilus plus Bifidobacterium infantis in the treatment of acute watery diarrhea. DESIGN: Open, randomized control trial. SETTING: King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Seventy-one infants (aged 1-24 months) with acute watery diarrhea that presented at Department of Pediatrics, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok were enrolled after parental signed informed consent. They were randomized into 2 groups. The Study group (n = 35) received live Lactobacillus plus Bifidobacterium (3 x 10(9) CFU) bid and ORS and the Control group (n = 36) received ORS only. All infants received lactose free milk. Case record forms were completed daily for 5 days by the parents. RESULTS: All 71 infants completed the present study. There was no difference of the patients'characteristics and baseline clinical symptoms between the study group and the control group. Live Lactobacillus plus Bifidobacterium shortened the diarrhea duration (1.6 +/- 0.7 days vs 2.9 +/- 1.7 days, p < 0.01) compared to controls. However the stool frequency and duration of hospitalization were not significantly different (p > 0.05, study group vs control group). CONCLUSION: Live Lactobacillus acidophilus plus Bifidobacterium infantis may be an effective treatment for acute watery diarrhea in infants. The 2-day course treatment can significantly shorten the duration of diarrhea.
TI  - A comparison of changes in the transformation of isoflavones in soymilk using varying concentrations of exogenous and probiotic-derived endogenous beta-glucosidases.
AB  - AIMS: To compare endogenous and exogenous beta-glucosidases for the hydrolysis of the predominant isoflavone glucosides in soymilk in order to improve the biological activity. METHODS AND RESULTS: beta-glucosidase activity of probiotic organisms, including Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis Bb12, Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4461 and Lactobacillus casei 2607 in soymilk, was evaluated and was related to the increase in the concentration of isoflavone aglycones during fermentation. The concentrations of isoflavone compounds in soymilk were monitored using a Varian model HPLC with an Amperometric electrochemical detector. The aglycone composition, also known as aglycone equivalent ratio, has been considered to be important for the delivery of health benefits of isoflavones, and was monitored during the fermentation of soymilk. Comparison of the hydrolytic effectiveness of both exogenous and endogenous enzyme during 4-h incubation in soymilk was conducted using the Otieno-Shah (O-S) index. Results showed that exogenous enzyme exhibited faster rate of isoflavone glucoside hydrolysis than that by endogenous enzyme. Highest O-S indices were obtained after 4, 3 and 2 h of incubation with enzyme solution having beta-glucosidase activity of 0.288 U ml(-1), 0.359 U ml(-1) and 0.575 U ml(-1), resulting into aglycone concentration increments of 5.87-, 6.07- and 5.94-fold, respectively. Conversely, aglycone concentration in the soymilk with B. animalis ssp. lactis Bb12, L. casei 2607 and L. acidophilus 4461 increased by 3.43-, 2.72- and 3.03-fold, respectively, after 4 h of fermentation at 37 degrees C. In addition, the O-S index of endogenous enzyme was much lower than that of the exogenous enzyme over the same 4-h incubation period. Optimum aglycone equivalent ratios coincided with highest O-S indices and highest aglycone concentrations in soymilk hydrolysed with exogenous enzyme. The same correlation of O-S indices and highest aglycone concentrations occurred for endogenous enzyme during the 24 h of fermentation. CONCLUSIONS: Obtaining highest aglycone concentration and optimum aglycone equivalent ratio could provide a critical beginning point in clinical trials for the realization of unique health benefits of soy isoflavones. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Screening for beta-glucosidase activities of probiotics in soymilk and comparing their hydrolytic potentials with that of exogenous beta-glucosidase could find wide applications in the development of different aglycone-rich functional soy beverages.
TI  - Extensive horizontal transfer of core genome genes between two Lactobacillus species found in the gastrointestinal tract.
AB  - BACKGROUND: While genes that are conserved between related bacterial species are  usually thought to have evolved along with the species, phylogenetic trees reconstructed for individual genes may contradict this picture and indicate horizontal gene transfer. Individual trees are often not resolved with high confidence, however, and in that case alternative trees are generally not considered as contradicting the species tree, although not confirming it either. Here we conduct an in-depth analysis of 401 protein phylogenetic trees inferred with varying levels of confidence for three lactobacilli from the acidophilus complex. At present the relationship between these bacteria, isolated from environments as diverse as the gastrointestinal tract (Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus johnsonii) and yogurt (Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus), is ambiguous due to contradictory phenotypical and 16S rRNA based classifications. RESULTS: Among the 401 phylogenetic trees, those that could be reconstructed with high confidence support the 16S-rRNA tree or one alternative topology in an astonishing 3:2 ratio, while the third possible topology is practically absent. Lowering the confidence threshold for trees to be taken into consideration does not significantly affect this ratio, and therefore suggests that gene transfer may have affected as much as 40% of the core genome genes. Gene function bias suggests that the 16S rRNA phylogeny of the acidophilus complex, which indicates that L. acidophilus and L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus are the closest related of these three species, is correct. A novel approach of comparison of interspecies protein divergence data employed in this study allowed to determine that gene transfer most likely took place between the lineages of the two species found in the gastrointestinal tract. CONCLUSION: This case-study reports an unprecedented level of phylogenetic incongruence, presumably resulting from extensive horizontal gene transfer. The data give a first indication of the large extent of gene transfer that may take place in the gastrointestinal tract and its accumulated effect. For future studies, our results should encourage a careful weighing of data on phylogenetic tree topology, confidence and distribution to conclude on the absence or presence and extent of horizontal gene transfer.
TI  - A randomized, controlled trial of lactic acid bacteria for idiopathic hyperoxaluria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urinary oxalate excretion is an important contributor to calcium oxalate stone formation. Methods of reducing oxalate excretion are not wholly satisfactory, and no controlled trials using them have been performed to prevent stone recurrence. Some lactic acid bacteria can degrade oxalate in vitro. This study sought to reduce urinary oxalate excretion in calcium stone formers with idiopathic hyperoxaluria. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND MEASUREMENTS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed of Oxadrop, a mix of four lactic acid bacterium species. This preparation previously reduced oxalate excretion in stone formers with idiopathic and enteric hyperoxaluria. Patients were selected from two stone prevention clinics. Twenty people with calcium stones and idiopathic hyperoxaluria (>40 mg/d) were enrolled and randomly assigned 1:1 in placebo and active preparation arms. Both groups took 3.6 g of granulate each day: Either placebo or the experimental preparation. Participants performed two consecutive 24-h urine collections at baseline, at 28 d of therapy, and at 56 d, after being off the preparation for 4 wk. Diet was replicated at each point. RESULTS: There was no effect of the study preparation: Mean 24-h urinary oxalate excretion in placebo-treated patients was 73.9 mg at baseline and 72.7 mg after treatment, whereas the Oxadrop-treated patients had 59.1 mg at baseline and 55.4 mg after treatment. The preparation was well tolerated; three participants on active treatment experienced mild constipation. CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized, placebo-controlled trial, Oxadrop did not reduce urinary oxalate excretion in participants with idiopathic hyperoxaluria.
TI  - In vitro inhibition of bacterial growth using different dental adhesive systems.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the antibacterial potential of four different adhesive systems. METHODS & MATERIALS: Gluma Comfort Bond + Desensitizer, Gluma Comfort Bond, iBond and One-Up Bond F were tested against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Actinomyces viscosus. The inhibition of growth by calibrated preparations was quantified by the measurement of zones of inhibition on bacterial lawns. Bactericidal activity was determined as reductions in recoverable colony-forming units in bacterial suspensions exposed to test preparations. RESULTS: All the preparations exhibited detectable zones of inhibition for all target bacteria through six months. When the bactericidal action was evaluated, all the materials were able to kill all the tested bacteria when tested immediately after polymerization. After one week of aging, iBond was the only material that continued to kill all of the test strains.
TI  - The effect of probiotic fermented milk and inulin on the functions and microecology of the intestine.
AB  - We investigated the effects of a probiotic fermented milk and inulin on gastrointestinal function and microecology. The study was double-blinded and comprised 66 healthy adults (22 male, 44 female), mean age 40 years (range, 22-60 years). After a 12-d baseline period the subjects were randomized to consume, for 3 weeks, 3x200 ml daily of either (1) a fermented milk with probiotics (Bifidobacterium longum BB536, Bifidobacterium spp. 420 and Lactobacillus acidophilus 145), (2) a fermented milk with the same probiotics plus 4 g inulin, or (3) a control fermented milk. During the last 7 d of the baseline and the intervention periods, the subjects kept a record of their defaecation frequency and gastrointestinal symptoms, and collected all their faeces. Intestinal transit time, stool weight and faecal enzyme activities were measured. Thirty-nine subjects were randomized to give faecal samples for analysis of pH and microbes, including lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, coliforms, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides and Clostridium perfringens. Consumption of fermented milk with probiotics or with probiotics and inulin increased the faecal number of lactobacilli (P=0.009, P=0.003) and bifidobacteria (P=0.046, P=0.038) compared with the baseline. Compared with the control fermented milk, both active products increased lactobacilli (P=0.005, ANCOVA). Subjects consuming fermented milk with probiotics and inulin suffered from gastrointestinal symptoms, especially flatulence, more than the others (P<0.001). In conclusion, the probiotic fermented milk product had a positive effect by increasing the number of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in the colon. Inulin did not alter this effect but it increased gastrointestinal symptoms.
TI  - Probiotics for treatment of acute diarrhoea in children: randomised clinical trial of five different preparations.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of five probiotic preparations recommended to  parents in the treatment of acute diarrhoea in children. Design Randomised controlled clinical trial in collaboration with family paediatricians over 12 months. SETTING: Primary care. PARTICIPANTS: Children aged 3-36 months visiting a family paediatrician for acute diarrhoea. INTERVENTION: Children's parents were randomly assigned to receive written instructions to purchase a specific probiotic product: oral rehydration solution (control group); Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG; Saccharomyces boulardii; Bacillus clausii; mix of L delbrueckii var bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, L acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium bifidum; or Enterococcus faecium SF68. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were duration of diarrhoea and daily number and consistency of stools. Secondary outcomes were duration of vomiting and fever and rate of admission to hospital. Safety and tolerance were also recorded. RESULTS: 571 children were allocated to intervention. Median duration of diarrhoea was significantly shorter (P<0.001) in children who received L rhamnosus strain GG (78.5 hours) and the mix of four bacterial strains (70.0 hours) than in children who received oral rehydration solution alone (115.0 hours). One day after the first probiotic administration, the daily number of stools was significantly lower (P<0.001) in children who received L rhamnosus strain GG and in those who received the probiotic mix than in the other groups. The remaining preparations did not affect primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes were similar in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Not all commercially available probiotic preparations are effective in children with acute diarrhoea. Paediatricians should choose bacterial preparations based on effectiveness data. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN56067537 [controlled-trials.com].
TI  - Selection and optimization procedure of synbiotic for cholesterol removal.
AB  - A selection and optimization procedure for the synbiotic combination of probiotic and prebiotics was established to optimize its cholesterol removal in vitro. In light of fermentability, prebiotics utilization by probiotics was highly variable and interspecies differences existed. Based on the results of fermentability, L. plantarum LS12, Ls31, LP529 and L. ruminis La3 could be the better candidates for symbiotic research. The bile tolerance of all the tested strains could be improved by the strain-specific prebiotics comparing to the control carbon source (glucose). The strain LS12 was finally selected to form the symbiotic according to its better ability to ferment prebiotics and bile tolerance, while the five prebiotics (FOS, stachyose, GOS, IMO and mannitol) were selected to make their synbiotic combination because of their better enhancement of bile tolerance and growth support to LS12. The synbiotic combination for cholesterol removal was optimized by use of response surface methodology. The first-order model showed that the selected prebiotics mannitol and GOS were significant factors. Then through the second-order polynomial regression model, the optimum conditions of the two factors for cholesterol removal by the synbiotic were suggested.
TI  - Targeted profiling of oral bacteria in human saliva and in vitro biofilms with quantitative real-time PCR.
AB  - An in vitro plaque model based on the use of human salivary bacteria and tooth-like surfaces was previously developed for studying the formation of oral biofilm and its use for pre-clinical testing of candidate antimicrobial or antiplaque agents. In this study, a quantitative Taqman PCR assay (QPCR) was developed to compare the bacterial compositions of in vitro biofilms to parent saliva samples, and to determine the relative contributions of different species in the formation of the oral biofilm. In addition, the growth inhibition of saliva-derived plaque was evaluated by chlorhexidine. With this assay, which consisted of primer/probe sets targeting either 16S rDNA sequences present in public databases or cloned ribosomal intergenic spacer region (ISR) sequences, 15 oral bacteria derived from saliva as well as those that were responsible for biofilm formation in an in vitro plaque model were rapidly identified and quantified. Among the target organisms were Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Micromonas micros, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Tannerella forsythensis, and Veillonella parvula. Primer and probe sets developed were both sensitive and specific. The relative profiles of a number of bacteria in 45-h-old biofilms were determined and, when compared to saliva samples, it was found that most of the bacteria identified in saliva also populated the in vitro plaque, including some anaerobes. Brief exposure of biofilms to chlorhexidine resulted in significant losses in viability. This new broad spectrum QPCR assay in combination with the in vitro plaque model will be of significant value in the quantitative study of the microbial composition of human saliva, saliva-derived plaque, and pre-clinical evaluation of potential antimicrobial and antiplaque molecules.
TI  - Experimental radiotherapy-induced enteritis: a probiotic interventional study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Acute radiation of the small intestine causes an immediate and potentially reversible effect on the sensitive regenerative epithelium of the intestinal mucosa while markedly altering the overall intestinal ecosystem. The aim of the present study was test a novel probiotic mixture formulation (Microflorana-F) in an experimental model of acute radiation enteritis with particular interest in endotoxinemia and bacterial translocation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Wistar rats allocated to three groups were fed for 7 days with: (A) a standard balanced diet; (B) a standard diet with the addition of 1 mL t.i.d. of Microflorana-F and (C) the same probiotic but after heat inactivation. Under ketamine anesthesia, abdominal irradiation was performed at a single dose rate of 20 Gy. Sham-radiated healthy rats served as a control (D). Standard food and active/inactive probiotic supplementation schedule was maintained throughout the study period. When they were killed 14 days later a midline laparotomy and a medium sternotomy was carried out. The mesenteric lymph nodes, whole spleen and liver samples as well as blood, the portal vein and bile samples were cultured. Endotoxinemia was also measured. RESULTS: Early deaths (1 week) occurred mostly in rats fed standard food or inactivated probiotic. The endotoxin level significantly increased in irradiated rats fed standard food and inactivated probiotic while supplementation with the active form of the probiotic mixture significantly improved such parameters (P < 0.05). After radiation injury, mesenteric lymph nodes and portal blood were the samples most frequently yielding bacterial growth. Treatment with only the active form of probiotic significantly reduced the incidence of bacterial contamination in all samples. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the manipulation of gut ecosystem by biologically effective probiotic preparations might be a worthwhile therapeutic and preventive tool in radiation-induced enteritis.
TI  - Effects of a synbiotic milk product on human intestinal ecosystem.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the effect of prolonged consumption of a synbiotic milk (Synbiotic) containing Lactobacillus acidophilus (strain 74-2, 10(7) CFU ml(-1)), Bifidobacterium lactis (strain 420, 10(7) CFU ml(-1)) and 2% inulin on colonic ecosystem in healthy humans. METHODS AND RESULTS: A group of 26 healthy subjects, aged 22-47 years, participated in a 6-week placebo-controlled dietary intervention study. After a 2-week baseline period, in which all volunteers consumed 500 ml day(-1) of 2% skimmed milk (Placebo), the study was designed as a randomized, double-blind, two-armed parallel study in which 4-week consumption of 500 ml day portions of Synbiotic or Placebo were compared. Faecal microbial counts, pH, l-lactic acid and bile acid concentrations were assessed before and after the intervention. Synbiotic consumption significantly decreased faecal dry weight (P < 0.01) and l-lactic acid (P < 0.05) concentration, while significantly increased faecal bifidobacteria (P < 0.05) and lactobacilli (P < 0.01) counts. CONCLUSION: The tested synbiotic milk showed its synbiotic nature by enhancing the growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Scientific support to functional effect of a synbiotic milk.
TI  - Lactobacillus Acidophilus strain L-92 regulates the production of Th1 cytokine as well as Th2 cytokines.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is growing interest in probiotics such as lactic acid bacteria  (LAB), not only for treatment of T helper type (Th) 1-mediated diseases but also for Th2-mediated diseases, including allergic diseases, since lactic acid bacteria may be able to modulate the Th1/Th2 balance, in addition to having an immunomodulative effect through induction of Th1 bias. METHODS: The effect of oral administration of heat-killed Lactobacillus acidophilus Strain L-92 (L-92) on ovalbumin (OVA)-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)E production was investigated in BALB/c mice. L-92 was orally administered to mice for 8 weeks from 2 weeks after initiation of OVA-immunization. Patterns of cytokine and Ig production in splenocytes and cells from Peyer's patches (PPs) from these mice were examined after restimulation with OVA in vitro. RESULTS: L-92 significantly suppressed serum OVA-specific IgE levels for a long period. Cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10 and Igs such as total IgE and OVA-specific IgE were produced at significantly lower levels by splenocytes of L-92-treated mice, compared with those of control mice. In contrast, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and IgA levels produced by PPs from L-92-treated mice were significantly higher than in those from control mice. CONCLUSIONS: Oral L-92 administration regulated both Th1 and Th2 cytokine responses, suppressed serum OVA-specific IgE, and induced TGF-beta production in PPs. TGF-beta is known to be associated with activation of regulatory T (Treg) cells. These data suggest that LAB may have immunomodulative effect by Treg cells via TGF-beta activity.
TI  - Probiotics for the treatment of women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - This review considers whether probiotics are effective agents for the treatment and/or prevention of bacterial vaginosis (BV). There seems to be an association between the absence of, or low concentrations of, vaginal lactobacilli and the development of BV. Many studies have suggested that the presence of H2O2-producing vaginal lactobacilli may protect against BV, although some studies do not support this hypothesis. In-vitro studies have suggested that certain specific strains of lactobacilli are able to inhibit the adherence of Gardnerella vaginalis to the vaginal epithelium and/or produce H2O2, lactic acid and/or bacteriocins, which inhibit the growth of bacteria causing BV. Clinical trials showed that intra-vaginal administration of Lactobacillus acidophilus for 6-12 days, or oral administration of L. acidophilus or Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus fermentum RC-14 for 2 months, resulted in the cure of BV (defined as a 0-1 positive score according to Amsel's criteria), and/or reduced the recurrences of BV, and/or caused an increase in vaginal lactobacilli and restoration of a normal vaginal microbiota, significantly more frequently than did a placebo, acetic acid or no treatment. However, several trials have found no significant difference in the cure rate of BV and in the number of vaginal lactobacilli after intra-vaginal instillation of lactobacilli when compared with the effect of a placebo or oestrogen. Thus, although the available results concerning the effectiveness of the administration of lactobacilli for the treatment of BV are mostly positive, it cannot yet be concluded definitively that probiotics are useful for this purpose.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of peroxide-based bleaching agents.
AB  - Antibacterial activity of 4 commercial bleaching agents (Day White, Colgate Platinum, Whiteness 10% and 16%) on 6 oral pathogens (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus sanguinis, Candida albicans, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus) and Staphylococcus aureus were evaluated. A chlorhexidine solution was used as a positive control, while distilled water was the negative control. Bleaching agents and control materials were inserted in sterilized stainless-steel cylinders that were positioned under inoculated agar plate (n = 4). After incubation according to the appropriate period of time for each microorganism, the inhibition zones were measured. Data were analyzed by 2-way analysis of variance and Tukey test (a = 0.05). All bleaching agents and the chlorhexidine solution produced antibacterial inhibition zones. Antimicrobial activity was dependent on peroxide-based bleaching agents. For most microorganisms evaluated, bleaching agents produced inhibition zones similar to or larger than that observed for chlorhexidine. C albicans, L casei, and L acidophilus were the most resistant microorganisms.
TI  - Functional petit-suisse cheese: measure of the prebiotic effect.
AB  - Prebiotics and probiotics are increasingly being used to produce potentially synbiotic foods, particularly through dairy products as vehicles. It is well known that both ingredients may offer benefits to improve the host health. This research aimed to evaluate the prebiotic potential of novel petit-suisse cheeses using an in vitro fermentation model. Five petit-suisse cheese formulations combining candidate prebiotics (inulin, oligofructose, honey) and probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium lactis) were tested in vitro using sterile, stirred, batch culture fermentations with human faecal slurry. Measurement of prebiotic effect (MPE) values were generated comparing bacterial changes through determination of maximum growth rates of groups, rate of substrate assimilation and production of lactate and short chain fatty acids. Fastest fermentation and high lactic acid production, promoting increased growth rates of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, were achieved with addition of prebiotics to a probiotic cheese (made using starter+probiotics). Addition of probiotic strains to control cheese (made using just a starter culture) also resulted in high lactic acid production. Highest MPE values were obtained with addition of prebiotics to a probiotic cheese, followed by addition of prebiotics and/or probiotics to a control cheese. Under the in vitro conditions used, cheese made with the combination of different prebiotics and probiotics resulted in the most promising functional petit-suisse cheese. The study allowed comparison of potentially functional petit-suisse cheeses and screening of preferred synbiotic potential for future market use.
TI  - Supra-gingival microbiota in Sjogren's syndrome.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the microbiota of noncaries associated supra-gingival plaque (SGP) microbiology in Sjogren's syndrome (SS). Stimulated whole saliva (SWS) and full-mouth SGP on intact tooth surfaces were collected from 26 primary (p) SS, 27 secondary (s) SS, and 29 control subjects for selective culture of lactobacilli, mutans streptococci, and aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative rods (AGNR). Predominant cultivable anaerobes from SGP of 11 randomly selected subjects from each group were investigated. Clinical and sialometric data were also collected. SS sufferers had significantly lower SWS flow rate and higher mean DMFT (decayed, missing, filled teeth), while pSS subjects also had lower SWS pH and fewer standing teeth. Lactobacillus acidophilus levels in SWS (P = 0.012) and SGP (P < 0.0001) were significantly elevated in pSS sufferers compared with sSS individuals and controls. AGNR isolation was uncommon. SS sufferers had significantly lower proportion of gram-negative species (P = 0.047). Non-oral species were isolated in greater proportions from pSS SGP (P = 0.007). Subjects with pSS harbored increased levels of L. acidophilus and non-oral species, while SS sufferers generally had lower proportions of gram-negative species. The microbial composition of noncaries associated SGP indicates a potential source of increased caries risk in SS.
TI  - [Evaluation of the antagonistic effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus on clinical strains of Helicobacter pylori].
AB  - The purpose of the study was to determine the antagonistic effect of Lactobacillus strains, isolated from saliva of healthy people on clinical strains of H. pylori. Two kinds of Lactobacillus strains were used in the tests i.e. strains producing hydrogen peroxide as well as strains not producing the metabolite. Clinical isolates of H. pylori were taken from the patients with confirmed duodenal and gastric ulcers. The evaluation of antagonistic effect between microorganisms was performed by using agar slab method. It was observed that Lactobacillus acidophilus had an antagonistic effect on growth of all strains of H. pylori tested. However, the particular Lactobacillus strains differed with respect to their inhibitory properties. Hydrogen peroxide did not have any significant impact on the inhibition of the growth of Helicobacter pylori.
TI  - Differential immunomodulating effects of inactivated probiotic bacteria on the allergic immune response.
AB  - Bacterial stimulation plays an important role in modulating the allergic immune response. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of inactivated probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus and non-pathogenic Escherichia coli strain Nissle on the phenotype and function of T- and B-cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with grass-pollen allergy (n=10) and non-allergic patients (n=19) were co-stimulated with inactivated bacteria and grass-pollen allergen. Expression of CD23, CD80, CD86 and CD69 were analysed, and the intracellular production of interleukin-4 and interferon-gamma was measured by direct ex vivo flow cytometry after stimulation. Both bacteria induced a significant up-regulation of CD69 expression on T-lymphocytes (p=0.001). CD23 expression was significantly increased following stimulation with allergen (p=0.008), but reduced after stimulation with Lactobacillus and significantly reduced with E. coli plus allergen (p=0.029). CD80 expression was reduced after stimulation with Lactobacillus in the allergic group only (p=0.021). By contrast, CD86 expression was significantly increased after stimulation with Lactobacillus (p=0.049) and distinctly increased with E. coli in both groups (p=0.001). The cytokine patterns of CD69-positive T-lymphocytes from allergic patients showed a TH2-dominated response after allergen stimulation (interferon-gamma/interleukin-4-ratio 0.2), directed into a T-helper1-like response by stimulation with both types of bacteria (interferon-gamma/interleukin-4-ratios 1.5-2.0 in both groups). These data show that both types of bacteria modulate the allergic immune response by the alteration of CD23 and co-stimulatory molecule expression. Regarding cytokine production, the data suggest a differential response to both bacteria depending on the atopic state, but a clear promotion of T-helper1-dominated response in allergic donors.
TI  - Rennet paste from lambs fed a milk substitute supplemented with Lactobacillus acidophilus: effects on lipolysis in ovine cheese.
AB  - The present work was undertaken to evaluate the effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus supplementation of a milk substitute on the features of lamb rennet paste used for cheese making. Lipolysis in cheese manufactured with rennet paste from lambs receiving supplemented milk was also evaluated. Lambs were subjected to 3 different feeding regimens (mother suckling, MS; artificial rearing, AR; and artificial rearing with 7 log10 cfu/mL of Lb. acidophilus supplementation of the milk substitute, ARLb) and slaughtered at 20 and 40 d of age for each feeding treatment. Abomasa of the lambs were processed to rennet paste. Microbial loads, enzymatic activities (chymosin, pepsin, and lipases), and renneting characteristics of the lamb rennet paste were determined. Free fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acids were detected in cheese at 60 d of ripening. Addition of 7 log10 cfu/mL of Lb. acidophilus to the milk substitute was carried out successfully. Total recovery of viable cells was recorded in milk supplied daily to the lambs in the ARLb group. The ARLb rennet had greater amounts of lactobacilli than did the MS or AR rennet, irrespective of the slaughter age of the lambs, and the ARLb rennet had higher concentrations of lactococci when lambs were slaughtered at 40 d of age. Chymosin and lipase activities were also higher in ARLb rennet than in MS or AR rennet from lambs slaughtered at an older age. Milk supplementation of ARLb lambs resulted in improved coagulating ability of the rennet and enhanced cheese lipolysis after 60 d of ripening. A reduction of all free fatty acids was observed in all cheeses when passing from 20 to 40 d of slaughter of the lambs. Conjugated linoleic acids were more abundant in ARLb cheeses at both 20 and 40 d. Therefore, supplementation of the milk substitute with Lb. acidophilus improved the enzymatic features of rennet and the healthful and nutritional characteristics of it the ovine cheese. Moreover, the addition of lactobacilli to the milk substitute made it possible to increase the slaughter age of lambs without detrimental effects on rennet characteristics.
TI  - Microscopic colitis.
AB  - As the diagnosis of microscopic colitis (MC) is made on the basis of histologic criteria, it is crucial to render an accurate microscopic interpretation. Features include 20 or more lymphocytes per 100 epithelial cells, mixed lamina propria inflammatory infiltrate, and preservation of crypt architecture for both lymphocytic and collagenous colitis (CC). CC is further characterized by a collagen band at least 10 mum thick. Although the pathogenesis of MC is poorly understood, medication-induced toxicity to the colonic mucosa is important to recognize, as medication cessation leads to prompt improvement. If MC is mild, symptomatic treatment is all that is needed, because some cases are self-limiting. Budesonide, 9 mg daily for at least 8 weeks, is the best documented treatment of choice for more severe or protracted cases. A 75% response rate has been reported; however, when treatment is discontinued, relapse is common, and longer-term tapering dose therapy often is necessary. There are disadvantages and no advantage to other forms of steroid therapy. Cholestyramine, bismuth, and 5-aminosalicylate derivatives appear to be less efficacious but are reasonable therapeutic options for less severe cases. Use of immunosuppressant therapy such as azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine should be highly restricted because MC is a benign condition that does not result in other complications. Probiotic therapy with Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium animalis has not been shown to be effective in reducing bowel frequency. Surgical diversion of the fecal stream can control diarrhea and improve histology but is very rarely indicated and should be reserved for highly selected cases of severely symptomatic steroid-refractory MC.
TI  - Selected prebiotics support the growth of probiotic mono-cultures in vitro.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to identify suitable prebiotics for synergistic  combinations with representative probiotics from the lactobacilli and bifidobacterium genera. Eleven different types of commercially available carbohydrates and compounds were screened in basal media for their effects on the growth of the probiotic cultures Lactobacillus acidophilus LAFTI L10 (L10), Bifidobacterium animalis lactis LAFTI B94 (B94) and Lactobacillus casei LAFTI L26 (L26). Growth of these probiotics was investigated by measuring optical density (OD) levels over a period of 48 h. The results of this study showed that all three probiotic strains were able to utilize a range of carbohydrates. Maximal growth of L10 was observed in basal medium supplemented with soybean oligosaccharide (SOS), followed by fructooligosaccharide (FOS) and inulin, while maximal growth of B94 was observed in basal medium supplemented with SOS, followed by raffinose, FOS, beta-glucan hydrolysate, inulin and Fibregum TAN. L26 was shown to exhibit maximal growth in basal medium supplemented with FOS followed by inulin, SOS, beta-glucan hydrolysate and beta-glucan concentrate. The results of this study indicate that several carbohydrates/compounds can enhance the growth of these representative probiotic strains in vitro.
TI  - Design of a multispecies probiotic mixture to prevent infectious complications in critically ill patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Although the potential for probiotics is investigated in an increasing variety of diseases, there is little or no consensus regarding the desired probiotic properties for a particular disease in question, nor about the final design of the probiotic. Specific strain selection procedures were undertaken to design a disease-specific multispecies probiotic. METHODS: From a strain collection of 69 different lactic acid bacteria a primary selection was made of 14 strains belonging to different species showing superior survival in a simulated gastrointestinal environment. Functional tests like antimicrobial activity against a range of clinical isolates and cytokine inducing capacity in cultured human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used to further identify potential strains. RESULTS: Specific strains inhibited growth of clinical isolates whereas others superiorly induced the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Based on functional tests and general criteria regarding probiotic design and safety, a selection of the following six strains was made (Ecologic 641); Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactococcus lactis. Combination of these strains resulted in a wider antimicrobial spectrum, superior induction of IL-10 and silencing of pro-inflammatory cytokines as compared to the individual components. CONCLUSIONS: Application of strict criteria during the design of a disease-specific probiotic prior to implementation in clinical trials may provide a rational basis for use of probiotics.
TI  - Prevalence and enumeration of Escherichia coli O157 in steers receiving various strains of Lactobacillus-based direct-fed microbials.
AB  - The objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of daily dietary inclusion of specific strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus on prevalence and concentration of Escherichia coli O157 in harvest-ready feedlot cattle. Five hundred yearling steers were housed in pens of 10 animals each. At arrival, steers were randomly allocated to one of five cohorts. Four of the cohorts were fed various strains and dosages of Lactobacillus-based direct-fed microbials throughout the feeding period. Fecal samples were collected from the rectum of each animal immediately prior to shipment to the abattoir. E. coli O157 was detected using selective enrichment and immunomagnetic separation techniques. For positive samples, E. coli O157 concentration was estimated using a most-probable-number (MPN) technique that included immunomagnetic separation. Prevalence varied among the cohorts (P < 0.01). The prevalence in the controls (26.3%) was greater (P < 0.05) than that in cattle supplemented with L. acidophilus strains NP51, NP28, or NP51-NP35 (13.0, 11.0, and 11.0%, respectively). The greatest E. coli O157 concentration was also observed in the controls (3.2 log MPN/g of feces); this concentration was greater (P < 0.05) than that observed in positive animals receiving NP51, NP28, or NP51-NP35 (0.9, 1.1, 1.7 log MPN/g of feces, respectively). Specific strains of Lactobacillus-based direct-fed microbials effectively reduced the prevalence and concentration of E. coli O157 in harvest-ready cattle, whereas others did not. When using direct-fed microbials to reduce carriage of E. coli O157 in cattle, it is important to select appropriately validated products.
TI  - Lactobacillus septic arthritis.
AB  - Lactobacillus is a Gram positive bacteria found in the mouth, gastrointestinal and female genital tract. Serious infections due to Lactobacillus are becoming increasingly common. We present a 49-year-old diabetic patient with Lactobacillus septic arthritis. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case. Usually, Lactobacillus is implicated with bacteremia, endocarditis and more rarely pneumonia, meningitis and endovascular infection, and half of the cases are reported in immunocompromised patients. As in our patient, diabetes mellitus is a comorbid condition which has been clearly noted. Our finding suggests that further studies are necessary to establish the significance of Lactobacillus as an etiologic agent of septic arthritis.
TI  - Activity of a Lactobacillus acidophilus-based douche for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Bacterial vaginosis is characterized by alteration of the normal vaginal microflora, in which a mixed anaerobic bacterial flora becomes prevalent over the population of lacobacilli. Because administration of probiotics might be of some utility in restoring a normal flora, the present study aimed to evaluate the effect of a Lactobacillus acidophilus-strain-based douche on the vaginal environment in bacterial vaginosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In an open-label pilot evaluation, 40 women with bacterial vaginosis as defined by Amsel's criteria were treated for 6 days with a douche containing L. acidophilus. Vaginal smears were collected from the patients and analyzed according to Nugent's criteria at the time of diagnosis, after 6 days of treatment, and again at 20 days after the last treatment. At the same times, determination of vaginal pH and a Whiff test were performed. RESULTS: The Nugent score decreased significantly from bacterial vaginosis or an intermediate flora toward a normal flora during treatment, and remained low during the follow-up period for almost all of the patients, indicating bacterial vaginosis in 52.5% and in 7.5% of the patients before treatment and at follow-up, respectively. After treatment, significant decreases in vaginal pH were observed, to less than pH 4.5 in 34/40 women, and the odor test became negative in all of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary study, treatment of bacterial vaginosis with a vaginal douche containing a strain of L. acidophilus contributed to the restoration of a normal vaginal environment.
TI  - Antiallergic effect of milk fermented with lactic acid bacteria in a murine animal model.
AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the antiallergic effect of fermented milk prepared, respectively, with Streptococcus thermophilus MC, Lactobacillus acidophilus B, Lactobacillus bulgaricus Lb, L. bulgaricus 448, and Bifidobacterium longum B6. Female BALB/c mice fed fermented milk were immunized intraperitoneally with ovalbumin (OVA)/complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) to evaluate the immune response by observing the secretion of cytokines IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma and serum antibody IgE. The results showed that supplementation with lactic acid bacteria fermented milk did not significantly change the IL-2 spontaneous and OVA-stimulated secretions of splenocytes. However, both spontaneous and OVA-stimulated secretions of splenocytes from mice fed lactic acid bacteria fermented milk showed significantly (P < 0.05) lower levels of IL-4 (Th2 cytokine) than those from OVA/CFA-immunized mice fed non-fermented milk (OVA/CFA-milk group). The spontaneous secretion of IFN-gamma (Th1 cytokine) by splenocytes from mice fed L. bulgaricus 448 or L. bulgaricus Lb fermented milk significantly increased as compared to that from the OVA/CFA-milk group. The results showed that the ratios of IFN-gamma to IL-4 of both spontaneous and OVA-stimulated secretions in splenocytes from mice fed lactic acid bacteria fermented milk increased significantly as compared to that of PBS- or OVA/CFA-milk groups. The serum levels of OVA-specific IgE in fermented milk fed groups, especially the group fed S. thermophilus MC fermented milk, were significantly lower than those in the OVA/CFA-milk group through a 6 week feeding experiment. The results showed that milk fermented with lactic acid bacteria demonstrated in vivo antiallergic effects on OVA/CFA-immunized mice via increasing the secretion ratio of IFN-gamma/IL-4 (Th1/Th2) by splenocytes and decreasing the serum level of OVA-specific IgE.
TI  - Probiotics prophylaxis in children with persistent primary vesicoureteral reflux.
AB  - Probiotics, beneficial living microorganisms, have been proven to be effective in preventing gastrointestinal infections, but their effect in preventing urinary tract infection (UTI) is inconclusive. A prospective randomized controlled study was done to compare the preventive effect of probiotics with conventional antibiotics in children with persistent primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). One hundred twenty children who had had persistent primary VUR after antibiotic prophylaxis for 1 year were randomly allocated into a probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus 10(8) CFU/g 1 g b.i.d., n = 60) or an antibiotics (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 2/10 mg/kg h.s., n = 60) prophylaxis group during the second year of follow-up. The incidence of recurrent UTI was 18.3% (11/60) in the probiotics group, which was not different from 21.6%(13/60) in the antibiotic group (P = 0.926). The causative organisms of recurrent UTI were not significantly different between the two groups (P = 0.938). Even after stratification by VUR grade, age, gender, phimosis, voiding dysfunction and renal scar, the incidence of recurrent UTI did not differ significantly between the two groups (P > 0.05). The development of new renal scar was not significantly different between the two groups (P > 0.05). In conclusion, probiotics prophylaxis was as effective as antibiotic prophylaxis in children with persistent primary VUR.
TI  - Rapid restoration of colonic goblet cells induced by a hydrolyzed diet containing probiotics in experimental malnutrition.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of the addition of probiotic bacteria to a hydrolyzed diet on the recovery of goblet cells during renutrition in an animal model of malnutrition. METHODS: Twenty-six male Wistar rats (200-250g) were included in the study. Six were kept under normal conditions (sham group) while twenty received an aproteic diet for 15 days, and were randomized thereafter to receive a hydrolyzed diet containing (n=6; probiotic group) or not (n=6; hydrolyzed group) probiotics (10(6) cfu/g of Streptococcus thermophilus e Lactobacillus helveticus); or immediately killed (n=8; aproteic group). Histological slides containing cecal and sigmoid biopsies were used to counting the number of goblet cells and the goblet cells/colonocytes ratio. RESULTS: Malnutrition diminished the population of goblet cells in all sites. Goblet cells/colonocytes ratio of the probiotic group was significantly greater than hydrolyzed group at the ceccum (0.39 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.34 +/-0.02; p=0.02). Only rats fed with probiotics showed complete restoration of the normal goblet cells/colonocytes ratio at the sigmoid (0.37 +/- 0,02 vs. 0.22 +/- 0,03; p<0,001). CONCLUSION: Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus helveticus added to a renutrition diet enhance the recovery of mucosal atrophy induced by malnutrition and especially induce a rapid restoration of goblet cells population in the malnourished colonic mucosa.
TI  - Determination of oxalyl-coenzyme A decarboxylase activity in Oxalobacter formigenes and Lactobacillus acidophilus by capillary electrophoresis.
AB  - Oxalyl-coenzyme A decarboxylase (OXC) is a key enzyme in the catabolism of the highly toxic oxalate, catalysing the decarboxylation of oxalyl-coenzyme A (Ox-CoA) to formyl-coenzyme A (For-CoA). In the present study, a capillary electrophoretic (CE) method was proposed for the assessment of the activity of recombinant OXC from two bacteria, namely Oxalobacter formigenes DSM 4420 and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA 14. In particular, the degradation of the substrate Ox-CoA occurring in the enzymatic reaction could be monitored by the off-line CE method. A capillary permanently coated with polyethylenimine (PEI) was used and in the presence of a neutral background electrolyte (50 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.0), a reversal of the electroosmotic flow was obtained. Under these conditions, the anodic migration of Ox-CoA (substrate) and For-CoA (reaction product) occurred and their separation was accomplished in less than 12 min. The CE method was validated for selectivity, linearity (range of Ox-CoA within 0.005-0.650 mM), sensitivity (LOD of 1.5 microM at the detection wavelength of 254 nm), precision and accuracy. Steady state kinetic constants (V(max), K(m) or k') of OXC were finally estimated for both the bacteria showing that although L. acidophilus LA 14 provided a lower oxalate breakdown than O. formigenes DSM 4420, it could be a potentially useful probiotic in the prevention of diseases related to oxalate.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of four glass ionomer cements used in atraumatic restorative treatment.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of four glass ionomer cements (Fuji IX, Ketac Molar, Vidrion R and Vitromolar) indicated for Atraumatic Restorative Treatment (ART) was studied against strains of bacteria involved in the development of oral diseases, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Actinomyces viscosus. The agar plate diffusion test was used for the cultures, which included chlorhexidine as a positive control. The results demonstrated that all the cements evaluated presented antibacterial activity. Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that Fuji IX and Ketac Molar presented the most effective antibacterial activity considering the ART approach.
TI  - Probiotics affect virulence-related gene expression in Escherichia coli O157:H7.
AB  - The attachment of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 (EHEC O157) to host  intestinal epithelial cells is essential for the development of hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic-uremic syndrome in humans. Genes involved in attachment are carried within a pathogenicity island named the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE), known to be directly activated by quorum sensing (QS). In the present study, we investigated autoinducer-2 (AI-2) production and the expression of several virulence-related genes in EHEC O157 grown in the absence and presence of a Lactobacillus acidophilus-secreted molecule(s). Transcription of important EHEC O157 virulence-related genes was studied by constructing promoter-reporter fusions and reverse transcriptase PCR. Shiga toxin (Stx) production was assayed by an enzyme immunoassay. When EHEC O157 was grown in the presence of chromatographically selected fractions of L. acidophilus La-5 cell-free spent medium, we observed a significant reduction of both extracellular AI-2 concentration and the expression of important virulence-related genes, although no significant difference in Stx production was observed. We show here that L. acidophilus La-5 secretes a molecule(s) that either acts as a QS signal inhibitor or directly interacts with bacterial transcriptional regulators, controlling the transcription of EHEC O157 genes involved in colonization.
TI  - Effects of a synbiotic containing Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4962 on plasma lipid profiles and morphology of erythrocytes in hypercholesterolaemic pigs on high- and low-fat diets.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a synbiotic containing Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4962, fructooligosaccharide, inulin and mannitol on plasma lipid profiles and erythrocyte membrane properties in hypercholesterolaemic pigs on high- and low-fat diets. Twenty-four white male Landrace pigs were randomly allocated to four treatment groups for 8 weeks (n 6). Treatment factors were the supplementation of synbiotic (with and without) and dietary fat (5 and 15 %). The supplementation of synbiotic reduced plasma total cholesterol (P = 0.001), TAG (P = 0.002) and LDL-cholesterol (P = 0.045) for both dietary fats. A higher concentration of esterified-cholesterol in HDL of pigs supplemented with synbiotic than the control regardless of dietary fat (P = 0.036) indicated that cholesterol was reduced in the form of cholesteryl esters. Reduced concentration of cholesteryl esters (P < 0.001) and increased concentration of TAG (P = 0.042) in LDL of pigs on synbiotic suggested that LDL-cholesterol was reduced via the hydrolysis of smaller and denser LDL particles. The erythrocytes of pigs without any synbiotic showed more prevalence of spur cells than those given the synbiotic, as supported by the higher cholesterol: phospholipid ratio in erythrocytes (P = 0.001). Also, membrane fluidity and rigidity were improved as supported by the decreased fluorescence anisotropies in the Hb-free erythrocyte membrane of pigs given synbiotic (P < 0.001). The administration of the synbiotic reduced plasma TAG, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol in hypercholesterolaemic pigs, possibly in the form of cholesteryl esters, via the interrelated pathways of lipid transporters (VLDL, LDL and HDL). The synbiotic also reduced deformation of erythrocytes via improved membrane fluidity and permeability.
TI  - Protective role of lactobacilli in Shigella dysenteriae 1-induced diarrhea in rats.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Studies on lactic acid bacteria exemplify their use against various enteropathogens in vitro. Nevertheless, in vivo effects of Lactobacillus during Shigella infection have not been evaluated. The present study evaluated the effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus acidophilus on neutrophil infiltration and lipid peroxidation during Shigella dysenteriae 1-induced diarrhea in rats. METHODS: The rats were divided into eight groups (n = 6 in each group). Induced rats received single oral dose of S. dysenteriae (12 x 10(8) colony-forming units [cfu]/mL). Treated rats received L. rhamnosus (1 x 10(7) cfu/mL) or L. acidophilus (1 x 10(7) cfu/mL) orally for 4 d, alone or in combination, followed by Shigella administration. At the end of the experimental period, animals were sacrificed and the assay of the activity of alkaline phosphatase, myeloperoxidase, and antioxidants and the estimation of lipid peroxides were performed. Activity staining of superoxide dismutase and catalase was done in addition to gelatin zymography for matrix metalloproteinase (MMP; MMP-2 and MMP-9) activity. A portion of the intestinal tissue was fixed in 10% formalin for histologic studies. RESULTS: Administration of S. dysenteriae 1 alone resulted in increased levels of myeloperoxidase, lipid peroxidation, alkaline phosphatase, and the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 with concomitant decrease in the antioxidant levels. Pretreatment with the combination of L. rhamnosus (1 x 10(7) cfu/mL) and L. acidophilus (1 x 10(7) cfu/mL) significantly attenuated these changes when compared with the diseased group. Histologic observations were in correlation with biochemical parameters. CONCLUSION: Lactobacillus rhamnosus plus L. acidophilus offered better protection when compared with individual treatment with these strains during Shigella infection.
TI  - Using of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium to product the isoflavone aglycones in fermented soymilk.
AB  - The study determined isoflavone aglycone contents in soymilk and sugar-soymilk fermented with a single culture of two strains of Lactobacillus paracasei, two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, and one strain of Bifidobacterium longum respectively at 37 degrees C for 24 h. Isoflavone concentration was analyzed by HPLC. The viable count of bacteria in all of the fermented soymilk ranged from 7 to 9 log CFU/ml. The isoflavone aglycone had a significant increase of 62%-96% of isoflavone in all of the fermented soymilk compared to 17% in non-fermented soymilk (P<0.05). The five strains of microorganisms produced lesser amount of isoflavone aglycones in fermented sucrose-soymilk than in other fermented soymilk.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis samples from different geographical origins against certain oral pathogens.
AB  - Propolis is an agent having antimicrobial properties, however, its composition can vary depending on the area where it is collected. In the present study, the antimicrobial activity of five propolis samples, collected from four different regions in Turkey and from Brazil, against nine anaerobic strains was evaluated. Ethanol extracts of propolis (EEP) were prepared from propolis samples and we determined minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of EEP on the growth of test microorganisms by using agar dilution method. All strains were susceptible and MIC values ranged from 4 to 512 microg/ml for propolis activity. Propolis from Kazan-Ankara showed most effective MIC values to the studied microorganisms. MBC values of Kazan-Ankara EEP samples were ranged from 8 to 512 microg/ml. Death was observed within 4 h of incubation for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and micros and Lactobacillus acidophilus and Actinomyces naeslundii, while 8 h for Prevotella oralis and Prevotella melaninogenica and Porphyromonas gingivalis, 12 h for Fusobacterium nucleatum, 16 h for Veillonella parvula. It was shown that propolis samples were more effective against Gram positive anaerobic bacteria than Gram negative ones. The organic chemical compositions of EEPs were determined by high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The main compounds of EEPs were flavonoids such as pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine, chrysin and aromatic acids such as cafeic acid. Because of increased antimicrobial resistance, propolis may be kept in mind in the treatment of oral cavity diseases.
TI  - Alpha-amylase starch binding domains: cooperative effects of binding to starch granules of multiple tandemly arranged domains.
AB  - The Lactobacillus amylovorus alpha-amylase starch binding domain (SBD) is a functional domain responsible for binding to insoluble starch. Structurally, this domain is dissimilar from other reported SBDs because it is composed of five identical tandem modules of 91 amino acids each. To understand adsorption phenomena specific to this SBD, the importance of their modular arrangement in relationship to binding ability was investigated. Peptides corresponding to one, two, three, four, or five modules were expressed as His-tagged proteins. Protein binding assays showed an increased capacity of adsorption as a function of the number of modules, suggesting that each unit of the SBD may act in an additive or synergic way to optimize binding to raw starch.
TI  - Effect of moderate electric field on the metabolic activity and growth kinetics of Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Moderate electric fields (MEF), applied across microbial growth media may potentially affect the permeability of cell membranes. We investigated the effects of MEF on bacteriocin (lacidin A) production during fermentation and on microbial growth kinetics of Lactobacillus acidophilus OSU 133. We comparatively investigated the following treatments: conventional, MEF (1 V/cm, 60 Hz, for 40 h), combinations of MEF (1 V/cm, 60 Hz, for the first 5 h) and conventional fermentation (for 35 h), and discrete MEF (1 V/cm, 2 min on and off, for 40 h). In all treatments, except as noted below, temperature was set at 30 degrees C. The two exceptions were control (conventional) and discrete MEF treatment, which were conducted both at 30 and 37 degrees C. MEF treatments at the early stage of fermentation at 30 degrees C showed the maximum bacteriocin activity. Minimum bacteriocin production was observed under conventional fermentation at 37 degrees C. A mathematical model based on Monod growth kinetics was used to predict bacteriocin production and showed results consistent with conventional treatment data. MEF did not have a significant effect on the lag time, maximum specific growth rate, biomass production and pH change under the different experimental conditions at each specific temperature. Based on the observations, bacteriocin activity under the presence of MEF at the early stage of fermentation increased without significant change in the final biomass.
TI  - Effectiveness and safety of Lactobacillus LB in the treatment of mild acute diarrhea in children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute diarrhea is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children. Oral rehydration salts (ORS) have lowered mortality without having an effect on the duration or severity of diarrhea. Some studies have reported that heat-killed Lactobacillus bacteria have a beneficial effect in the treatment of acute diarrhea. In this placebo-controlled study the duration of diarrhea was compared for 2 types of treatment: Lactobacillus LB (Lacteol) in association with oral rehydration and oral rehydration alone. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 80 nondehydrated children between the ages of 3 months and 4 years with acute watery diarrhea were randomly assigned to be treated with Lactobacillus LB or placebo plus ORS. The primary endpoint was the duration of diarrhea; intake of ORS and change in body weight between the time of randomization and the last assessment were also measured. RESULTS: In 71 of the 80 patients, diarrhea was resolved: 36 in the Lactobacillus LB group and 35 in the placebo group. Several clinical characteristics of the 2 treatment groups were comparable at baseline. Median duration of diarrhea was 16.6 hours in the placebo group compared with 10.0 hours in the Lactobacillus LB group (P = 0.275). In the subgroup with a duration of diarrhea of more than 24 hours at inclusion, duration of diarrhea measured from that point was shorter for the Lactobacillus LB group (30.4 h vs 8.2 h; P = 0.044). ORS intake was similar for both groups. Lactobacillus LB was well tolerated, with only one patient experiencing an adverse effect. CONCLUSIONS: Lactobacillus LB is an effective and safe treatment for children with well-established diarrhea (>24 h).
TI  - Characterization of a novel bile-inducible operon encoding a two-component regulatory system in Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM is an industrially important strain used extensively as a probiotic culture. Tolerance of the presence of bile is an attribute important to microbial survival in the intestinal tract. A whole-genome microarray was employed to examine the effects of bile on the global transcriptional profile of this strain, with the intention of elucidating genes contributing to bile tolerance. Genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism were generally induced, while genes involved in other aspects of cellular growth were mostly repressed. A 7-kb eight-gene operon encoding a two-component regulatory system (2CRS), a transporter, an oxidoreductase, and four hypothetical proteins was significantly upregulated in the presence of bile. Deletion mutations were constructed in six genes of the operon. Transcriptional analysis of the 2CRS mutants showed that mutation of the histidine protein kinase (HPK) had no effect on the induction of the operon, whereas the mutated response regulator (RR) showed enhanced induction when the cells were exposed to bile. These results indicate that the 2CRS plays a role in bile tolerance and that the operon it resides in is negatively controlled by the RR. Mutations in the transporter, the HPK, the RR, and a hypothetical protein each resulted in loss of tolerance of bile. Mutations in genes encoding another hypothetical protein and a putative oxidoreductase resulted in significant increases in bile tolerance. This functional analysis showed that the operon encoded proteins involved in both bile tolerance and bile sensitivity.
TI  - Do probiotics prevent allergy?
AB  
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus 74-2 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis DGCC 420 modulate unspecific cellular immune response in healthy adults.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: It was determined whether a combination of Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) 74-2 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis DGCC 420 (B. lactis 420) affect the faecal microbiota as well as immunological parameters and blood lipids in healthy adults. DESIGN: A placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized crossover trial was conducted. SUBJECTS: Twenty-six healthy volunteers (mean age 25 years) were recruited by advertising in academical buildings. All of them completed the study. METHODS: After 3-week run-in period, half of the volunteers consumed 300 g/day of yoghurt supplement containing probiotic strains L. acidophilus 74-2 and B. lactis 420, and the other half received the placebo product for a period of 5 weeks. The two groups were crossed during the following 5-week period. Blood and faecal samples were collected at the end of each period. The faecal content of probiotic bacteria, faecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), serum lipids and plasma immune system biomarkers were evaluated. RESULTS: Faecal proportions of L. acidophilus and of B. lactis increased significantly from 0.02 to 0.19 and 0.4 to 1.4% (P<0.05), respectively. Percentages of granulocytes and monocytes showing phagocytic activity were significantly elevated from 92 to 95% during probiotic intervention, whereas their oxidative burst activity and specific immune parameters remained unaffected. Fecal SCFA and serum cholesterol levels were not influenced by the probiotics. However, serum concentrations of triacylglyceroles decreased significantly by 11.6% (P<0.05) in the probiotic supplementation period. CONCLUSIONS: L. acidophilus and B. lactis were recovered in faeces in significantly elevated numbers after supplementation. They are able to modulate unspecific cellular immune response indicated by the increased phagocytic activity.
TI  - Micronucleus rate of buccal mucosal epithelial cells in relation to oral hygiene  and dental factors.
AB  - Carcinogenesis of squamous cell carcinomas in the upper aero-digestive tract (UADT) is a multi-stage process. Since 1937, micronuclei (MN) have been considered a marker for genome damage in the initiation stage. By help of the micronucleus test, carcinogenic exposure can be proven in the mucosa area of the UADT. The hypothesis to be tested was that individual oral hygiene and the dental status, respectively - just like alcohol and tobacco abuse - are associated with the micronucleus rate in cytological preparations of the buccal mucosa. In a prospective clinical observation study, we determined in 100 probands the micronucleus frequency per 1000 mucosa epithelial cells. Study participants with a high number of missing teeth (M/T index, p=0.037), a below-average papillary bleeding index (PBI, p=0.032) and periodontal status, respectively (PSI, p=0.042) possessed a higher micronucleus number in comparison with restored dental conditions. Probands with composite restorations displayed a higher MN rate (p=0.006) compared to those with amalgam. However, we could not detect any significant relation with the prosthetic status (p> or =0.075). An adjustment was made according to alcohol and tobacco. We therefore conclude that subgingival plaque and synthetic dental materials in addition to chronic alcohol and tobacco consumption might have genotoxic relevance in the oral cavity.
TI  - Effects of inner-phase components of water-in-oil-in-water emulsion on low-pH tolerance of Lactobacillus acidophilus incorporated into inner-water phase.
AB  - The incorporation of Lactobacillus acidophilus, which has a low acid tolerance, into the inner-water phase of water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) emulsion improved the bacterial survival rate in a model gastric juice. The components that enhanced the acid tolerance of the bacterium in W/O/W emulsion were investigated. Although the acid tolerance enhancement induced by the tested components was low at pH 2, some components significantly improved the tolerance at pH 4. In particular, the acid tolerance enhancement induced by yeast extract and sodium caseinate was marked.
TI  - Administration of Lactobacillus evokes coordinated changes in the intestinal expression profile of genes regulating energy homeostasis and immune phenotype in mice.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria are probiotics widely used in functional food products, with a variety of beneficial effects reported. Recently, intense research has been carried out to provide insight into the mechanism of the action of probiotic bacteria. We have used gene array technology to map the pattern of changes in the global gene expression profile of the host caused by Lactobacillus administration. Affymetrix microarrays were applied to comparatively characterize differences in gene transcription in the distal ileum of normal microflora (NMF) and germ-free (GF) mice evoked by oral administration of two Lactobacillus strains used in fermented dairy products today - Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei F19 (L. F19) or Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFB 1748. We show that feeding either of the two strains caused very similar effects on the transcriptional profile of the host. Both L. F19 and L. acidophilus NCFB 1748 evoked a complex response in the gut, reflected by differential regulation of a number of genes involved in essential physiological functions such as immune response, regulation of energy homeostasis and host defence. Notably, the changes in intestinal gene expression caused by Lactobacillus were different in the mice raised under GF v. NMF conditions, underlying the complex and dynamic nature of the host-commensal relationship. Differential expression of an array of genes described in this report evokes novel hypothesis of possible interactions between the probiotic bacteria and the host organism and warrants further studies to evaluate the functional significance of these transcriptional changes on the metabolic profile of the host.
TI  - [Adhesion of various species of lactic acid bacteria depending on the AB0 system  blood group].
AB  - The influence of the AB0 blood groups on adhesion of different lactic acid bacteria species was studied. From twelve investigated strains of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. plantarum and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus species, difference between adhesion average index on erythrocytes of various blood groups was found in two strains. The average adhesion index of the strain E. faecium K-50 in A (II) blood group erythrocytes was higher (AAI = 4.91 +/- 0.26) than in B (III) blood group erythrocytes (AAI = 4.17 +/- 0.33). The strain L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 4n has displayed a higher adhesive activity in A (II) blood group erythrocytes (AAI = 4.36 +/- 0.13) in comparison with AB (III) blood group erythrocytes (AAI = 3.61 +/- 0.75).
TI  - Basic characteristics of Sporolactobacillus inulinus BCRC 14647 for potential probiotic properties.
AB  - The basic characteristics of the spore-forming lactic acid bacterium, Sporolactobacillus inulinus BCRC 14647, was evaluated in vitro for its potential probiotic properties. Assessments including acid and bile salt tolerance, adhesiveness, and antagonistic effects on pathogenic Salmonella enteritidis BCRC 10744, as well as inhibition factors of spent culture supernatant (SCS) and an invasion assay, were conducted using Lactobacillus acidophilus BCRC 10695 and two bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium bifidum BCRC 14615 and B. longum BCRC 11847) as a reference. In the results, S. inulinus spores presented significantly higher survival rates than the vegetative cell form in acidic conditions as well as the reference bifidobacteria. However, L. acidophilus showed the highest viability among all tested strains. Similar results were found in the bile tolerance test. Compared with the reference strains, the vegetative cell form of S. inulinus possessed a proper adhesive characteristic (71.7 bacteria/field for S. inulinus and 91.3 and 45.7 bacteria/field for B. bifidum and B. longum, respectively). In the adhesion assay, both the spore form of S. inulinus (17.1 bacteria/field) and the negative control, L. bulgaricus BCRC 14009 (5.9 bacteria/field), displayed nonadhesive traits. The vegetative cells of S. inulinus and its SCS both dramatically decrease the adhesion of S. enteritidis to Caco-2 cells; meanwhile, the SCS of S. inulinus vegetative cells inhibited the growth of S. enteritidis in the inhibition zone test. The existing inhibition factor could be assumed to be lactic acid in the SCS. From the results of the invasion assay, S. inulinus showed high safety properties. In conclusion, based on these in vitro evaluations, results suggest that S. inulinus presents probiotic features of great potential in the vegetative cell form.
TI  - Identification of lactobacilli isolated from the cloaca and vagina of laying hens and characterization for potential use as probiotics to control Salmonella Enteritidis.
AB  - AIMS: To select Lactobacillus strains from laying hens for potential use as probiotic to control Salmonella Enteritidis infection. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-six lactobacilli were isolated from the cloaca and vagina of laying hens, and identified at the species level by a polyphasic taxonomic approach. All isolates belonged to the Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus reuteri or Lactobacillus salivarius phylogenetic groups, with the L. reuteri group being the most predominant group. Based on genetic diversity, about 50 representative strains were selected and tested for in vitro properties that could be predictive for probiotic activity in laying hens. Salmonella inhibition was shown to be species dependent, and correlated to some extent with the production of lactic acid. A selection of strains was evaluated in a S. Enteritidis challenge experiment. Two strains, L. reuteri R-17485 and Lactobacillus johnsonii R-17504 significantly decreased the colonization of chicks by S. Enteritidis in caeca, liver and spleen. CONCLUSIONS: Lactobacilli isolated from laying hens were observed to inhibit Salmonella growth in vitro, most probably through production of lactic acid, and to decrease in vivo the S. Enteritidis colonization of chicks. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The data demonstrate that Lactobacillus isolates from laying hens may have probiotic potential in reducing S. Enteritidis infection.
TI  - Effects of probiotics on enteric flora and feeding tolerance in preterm infants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics are live microbes that colonize the gastrointestinal tract and benefit the host. Preterm infants develop abnormal patterns of bowel colonization, and only a few clinical trials have reported the outcomes of preterm infants treated with probiotics. PURPOSE: We investigated the rate of colonization of Lactobacillus and the clinical variables affecting the colonization in preterm infants. METHODS: Infants with gestational age less than 37 weeks treated at Ewha Womans University Hospital between March 2003 and July 2004 were eligible. Lactobacillus acidophilus (containing 10(8) CFU) was supplemented orally, mixed with breast milk or formula divided into three doses a day. Stool samples were collected before and 14 days after supplementation of the probiotic. Stool samples were anaerobically cultured on Rogosa agar and identified by Gram stain, catalase test and glucose fermentation test. Clinical characteristics were analyzed. RESULTS: Seventy-three patients with an average gestational age of 33.0 +/- 2.5 weeks were studied. Meconium was cultured in 46 patients and Lactobacillus was not detected. Probiotic supplementation began on 3.4 +/- 6.8 days, and after 14 days of supplementation, Lactobacillus was cultured in an average of 3.01 x 10(8) CFU in the stool of 37.0% (27/73) of the patients. There was a tendency towards an increased incidence of sepsis in the Lactobacillus- group (p = 0.082). In the Lactobacillus+ group, a striking increase in feeding tolerance was detected. CONCLUSION: In preterm infants, with the administration of probiotics, 37% of the preterm infants had Lactobacillus colonized in the gastrointestinal tract and improved feeding tolerance. A double-blind study is in progress for further investigation into the effect on other systemic diseases in premature infants.
TI  - The importance of lactic acid bacteria for phytate degradation during cereal dough fermentation.
AB  - Lactic acid fermentation of cereal flours resulted in a 100 (rye), 95-100 (wheat), and 39-47% (oat) reduction in phytate content within 24 h. The extent of phytate degradation was shown to be independent from the lactic acid bacteria strain used for fermentation. However, phytate degradation during cereal dough fermentation was positively correlated with endogenous plant phytase activity (rye, 6750 mU g(-1); wheat, 2930 mU g(-1); and oat, 23 mU g(-1)), and heat inactivation of the endogenous cereal phytases prior to lactic acid fermentation resulted in a complete loss of phytate degradation. Phytate degradation was restored after addition of a purified phytase to the liquid dough. Incubation of the cereal flours in buffered solutions resulted in a pH-dependent phytate degradation. The optimum of phytate degradation was shown to be around pH 5.5. Studies on phytase production of 50 lactic acid bacteria strains, previously isolated from sourdoughs, did not result in a significant production of intra- as well as extracellular phytase activity. Therefore, lactic acid bacteria do not participate directly in phytate degradation but provide favorable conditions for the endogenous cereal phytase activity by lowering the pH value.
TI  - Effect of direct-fed microbials on performance, diet digestibility, and rumen characteristics of Holstein dairy cows.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the effect of feeding direct-fed microbial (DFM) products containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Propionibacteria freudenreichii on the performance, nutrient digestibility, and rumen fermentation of Holstein dairy cows in midlactation. Experiments were conducted from February to May 2003. Cows were fed 1 of 3 dietary treatments: 1) 1 x 10(9) colony-forming units (cfu)/d of live L. acidophilus strain LA747 and 2 x 10(9) cfu/d of live P. freudenreichii strain PF24 (DFM1); 2) 1 x 10(9) cfu/d of live L. acidophilus strain LA747, 2 x 10(9) cfu/d of live P. freudenreichii strain PF24, and 5 x 10(8) cfu/d of L. acidophilus strain LA45 (DFM2); or 3) lactose (control). Treatments were administered by mixing 45 g of finely ground corn with 5 g of DFM products or lactose and top dressing on the total mixed rations once daily. All cows received the same total mixed ration: 12.7% alfalfa hay, 46.2% corn silage, and 41.1% concentrate on a dry matter (DM) basis. In study 1 (lactation study), 39 multiparous and 18 primiparous Holstein cows were blocked by parity and randomly assigned to treatments for 84 d. Starting on d 35, fecal grab samples were collected from each cow at 5- to 8-h intervals over 48 h for digestibility measurements. A rumen fermentation study (study 2) was conducted concurrently with the lactation study. Three rumenfistulated, multiparous Holstein cows were randomly assigned to dietary treatments DFM1, DFM2, and control in a 3 x 3 Latin square design with 28-d periods. In study 1, there was no difference in average DM intake (23.9, 23.6, and 24.2 kg/d) or 4% fat-corrected milk (36.8, 35.3, and 36.2 kg/d) for treatments DFM1, DFM2, and control. Percentage or yield of milk components also did not differ among treatments. Feed efficiency averaged 1.52 kg of 4% fat-corrected milk/kg of DM intake and did not differ among treatments. There were no differences in apparent DM, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, or starch digestibility among treatments. In study 2, there was no difference in rumen pH and concentrations of ammonia or total volatile fatty acids measured at 0, 1, 3, and 6 h after feeding. Under the conditions of these studies, supplementing midlactation cows with DFM products containing L. acidophilus and P. freudenreichii did not affect cow performance, diet digestibility, or rumen fermentation.
TI  - Chromosomal-gene-mediated inhibition of intestinal and foodborne pathogens by Lactobacillus acidophilus AA11.
AB  - Approximately 63 strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus were isolated from Egyptian home-made cheese and examined for production of antagonism. Only eight strains demonstrated inhibitory activity against spoilage microorganisms (i.e. Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus) and pathogens (i.e. E. coli, Salmonella sp. and Shigella sp.). Lactobacillus acidophilus AA11 produced a more antimicrobial activity with a wide range of inhibition. The agent AA11 was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and retained full activity after 30 min at 100 degrees C. Activity against sensitive cells was bactericidal but not bacteriolytic. The compound was produced during growth phase and can be extracted from the culture supernatant fluids with n-Butanol. 12 % SDS-PAGE analysis of 40% ammonium sulphate precipitated agent showed two peptides with molecular weights of approximately 36 kDa and approximately 29 kDa. No plasmid was identified in Lactobacillus acidophilus AA11 indicating that the genes encoding the inhibitory agent located on the chromosome. These characteristics identify the inhibitory substance as a bacteriocin, designated acidocin AA11 and confer the agent an application potential as a biopreservative.
TI  - Prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea by a fermented probiotic milk drink.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the preventive effect of a milk drink fermented with multistrain probiotics on antibiotic associated diarrhoea (AAD). DESIGN: Double-blind placebo controlled study. SETTING: University Hospital of North Norway. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Of 853 patients treated with antibiotics, 87 met the inclusion criteria, and were randomized to ingestion of a fermented milk drink containing LGG, La-5 and Bb-12 (n=46) or placebo with heat-killed bacteria (n=41), during a period of 14 days. A diary was recorded, and stool samples were collected for microbiological analyses. RESULTS: Sixty-three patients completed the study according to the protocol; two patients (5.9%) in the treatment group and eight (27.6%) in the placebo group developed AAD (P=0.035). The relative risk of developing AAD was 0.21 (95% confidence interval: 0.05-0.93) when given probiotic milk drink. CONCLUSION: A fermented multistrain probiotic milk drink may prevent four of five cases of AAD in adult hospitalized patients. SPONSORSHIP: TINE BA, Oslo, Norway.
TI  - Probiotic capsules do not lower plasma lipids in young women and men.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of probiotic capsules on plasma lipids. DESIGN: A randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm trial. SUBJECTS: Fifty-five normocholesterolemic subjects ages 18-36 (33 premenopausal women and 22 men). INTERVENTION: Each subject consumed either three probiotic capsules each containing a total of 10(9) colony-forming units Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium longum and 10-15 mg fructo-oligosaccharide or three placebo capsules daily for 2 months (men) or two menstrual cycles (women). Plasma lipids were measured before and following the intervention (during the early follicular phase for women). RESULTS: Plasma concentrations of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride were not altered by consumption of probiotic or placebo capsules and were not different between treatment groups following the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: These results do not support a beneficial effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus strain DDS-1 and Bifidobacterium longum strain UABL-14 on plasma lipids in normocholesterolemic young women and men. SPONSORSHIP: Supported by the Minnesota Agricultural Experiment Station and UAS Laboratories.
TI  - [Control of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) in cattle].
AB  - Cattle are recognized as the major reservoir of STEC and the source of infection  for human beings. Until recently, intervention strategies to decrease the contamination of meat products have been focused on the slaughter plant with the application of practices to reduce the contamination and proliferation of STEC. This has now changed following the development of intervention strategies in the farm. This could be one of the most important points of intervention to lower the incidence of human infection. Vaccines, probiotics, bacteriophages, and changes in production practices may be useful as strategies to control EHEC in the cattle. The application of such intervention measures could be difficult due to the fact that this zoonotic agent rarely causes disease in bovines. The HUS is endemic in Argentina, and the factors leading to this epidemiological situation remain unknown. However, intervention strategies undoubtedly will contribute to reduce the incidence of this zoonosis.
TI  - Dentin decontamination using chloramine T prior to experiments involving bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the importance of ISO11405 recommended storage regime for extracted teeth in surface disinfectant chloramine T (chlT) prior to use in biofilm or in vitro caries studies involving microorganisms. ChlT may be absorbed into dentin and undergoes breakdown with organic material. METHODS: Extracted roots were stored in chlT (2 days), rinsed and transferred to distilled deionised water. HPLC at regular intervals determined chlT elution. At 4 weeks roots were boiled in water and eluent assessed with HPLC. ChlT breakdown (+/-organic material) over time was monitored with HPLC. ChlT minimum inhibitory/bactericidal concentration (MIC/MBC) against Lactobacillus acidophilus was evaluated using L. acidophilus broth and chlT serial dilutions. RESULTS: No significant increase in chlT elution was detected between 2h and 4 weeks (ANOVA, Tukeys, p>0.05), although levels tended to increase with time. ChlT detected in water was 0.005%, corresponding to 0.05% in dentin. After boiling (4 weeks) chlT breakdown products in water corresponded to 0.015% in dentin. MIC/MBC of chlT against L. acidophilus was 0.031%. SIGNIFICANCE: ChlT breakdown is accelerated by organic material. L. acidophilus is highly sensitive to chlT. ChlT readily leaches from dentin but rinsing does not reduce chlT concentration below MIC/MBC. Low levels of chlT may remain but will probably be in a less active form. Teeth disinfected in chlT for use in research involving bacteria must be stored in distilled water for at least 2h to reduce chlT concentration below MBC, although longer will give greater elution and breakdown.
TI  - Effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus strain NP51 on Escherichia coil O157:H7 fecal shedding and finishing performance in beef feedlot cattle.
AB  - A 2-year study was conducted during the summer months (May to September) to test  the effectiveness of feeding Lactobacillus acidophilus strain NP51 on the proportion of cattle shedding Escherichia coli O157:H7 in the feces and evaluate the effect of the treatment on finishing performance. Steers (n = 448) were assigned randomly to pens, and pens of cattle were assigned randomly to NP51 supplementation or no supplementation (control). NP51 products were mixed with water and applied as the feed was mixed daily in treatment-designated trucks at the rate of 10(9) CFU per steer. Fecal samples were collected (n = 3,360) from the rectum from each animal every 3 weeks, and E. coli O157:H7 was isolated by standard procedures, using selective enrichment, immunomagnetic separation, and PCR confirmation. The outcome variable was the recovery of E. coli O157:H7 from feces, and was modeled using logistic regression accounting for year, repeated measures of pens of cattle, and block. No significant differences were detected for gain, intakes, or feed efficiency of control or NP51-fed steers. The probability for cattle to shed E. coli O157:H7 varied significantly between 2002 and 2003 (P = 0.004). In 2002 and 2003, the probability for NP51-treated steers to shed E. coli O157:H7 over the test periods was 13 and 21%, respectively, compared with 21 and 28% among controls. Over the 2 years, NP51-treated steers were 35% less likely to shed E. coli O157: H7 than were steers in untreated pens (odds ratio = 0.58, P = 0.008). This study is consistent with previous reports that feeding NP51 is effective in reducing E. coli O157:H7 fecal shedding in feedlot cattle.
TI  - Surface expression of Toll-like receptor 9 is upregulated on intestinal epithelial cells in response to pathogenic bacterial DNA.
AB  - Colonic epithelial cells are constantly exposed to high levels of bacterial DNA in the intestinal lumen and must recognize and respond appropriately to pathogens, while they maintain a tolerance to nonpathogenic commensal bacterial strains. Bacterial DNA is recognized by Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9). The aim of this study was to investigate TLR9 expression and localization in colonic epithelial cells under basal conditions and in response to bacterial DNA. HT-29 cells were exposed to DNA from various strains of commensal and pathogenic microbes. TLR9 mRNA expression was determined by real-time reverse transcription-PCR, and interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Localization of TLR9 was determined by flow cytometry in HT-29 cells and by immunofluorescence in HT-29 cells and mouse colonic tissue. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometric analyses demonstrated that there was intracellular and surface expression of TLR9 in HT-29 cells under basal conditions. Exposure of cells to DNA from pathogenic strains of Salmonella and Escherichia coli resulted in a significant increase in TLR9 mRNA expression. Salmonella enterica serovar Dublin DNA increased surface TLR9 protein and IL-8 secretion. There was no change in mRNA levels or localization of TLR9 in response to Bifidobacterium breve. Chloroquine did not block IL-8 secretion in response to S. enterica serovar Dublin DNA. TLR9 was expressed on the colonic apical surface in wild-type mice but not in germfree mice. These results demonstrate that intestinal epithelial cells recognize pathogenic bacterial DNA and respond by increasing surface localization and expression of TLR9, suggesting that the epithelial inflammatory response to pathogenic DNA is mediated at least in part by increased TLR9 expression.
TI  - Probiotics and prebiotics: effects on diarrhea.
AB  - Probiotics have preventive as well as curative effects on several types of diarrhea of different etiologies. Prevention and therapy (or alleviation) of diarrhea have been successfully investigated for numerous dietary probiotics to establish probiotic properties and to justify health claims (the medicinal use of probiotic food and the therapy of gastrointestinal diseases itself may not be advertised under current food laws). Other probiotic microorganisms (e.g., Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. reuteri, certain strains of L. casei, L. acidophilus, Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917, and certain bifidobacteria and enterococci (Enterococcus faecium SF68) as well as the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii have been investigated with regard to their medicinal use, either as single strains or in mixed-culture probiotics. However, the effects on humans have been assessed mainly in smaller (n<100) randomized, controlled clinical studies or in open label trials, but large intervention studies and epidemiological investigations of long-term probiotic effects are largely missing. Perhaps with the exception of nosocomial diarrhea or antibiotic-associated diarrhea, the results of these studies are not yet sufficient to give specific recommendations for the clinical use of probiotics in the treatment of diarrhea.
TI  - Influence of the dairy environment on gene expression and substrate utilization in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are widely used for the industrial production of fermented dairy products and form a group of related low-GC-content gram-positive bacteria. The major species used in dairy manufacturing are Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Streptococcus, and Leuconostoc. Traditionally most are applied as starter cultures for dairy fermentations or used as probiotic cultures, delivered in dairy vehicles. The appearance of the genomes of Lactococcus lactis, Bidifobacterium longum, Lactobacillus plantarum, L. johnsonii, L. acidophilus, 2 strains of Streptococcus thermophilus, and pending completion of many draft genomic sequences, is now promoting in-depth investigation into the comparative genetic content of LAB. Moreover, whole-genome transcriptional arrays are quickly revealing critical genes/operons that are coordinately expressed and the impact of environmental factors on expression of multiple gene sets. Comparative genomics between multiple genomes is providing insights into genes that are important in metabolic, physiological, and functional roles for different LAB in the environments they inhabit, ranging from the gastrointestinal tract to milk and acidified dairy products.
TI  - Molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. METHODS: Samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. On the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. The isolates were determined as Lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16S rDNA. Sequencing of 16S rDNA genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies levels. RESULTS: Predominant species were Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus cellobiosus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and Lactobacillus gasseri were also present. The isolates Lactobacillus salivarius BGHO1, Lactobacillus fermentum BGHO36 and BGHO64, Lactobacillus gasseri BGHO89 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis BGHO99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus flavus, Salmonella enteritidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of Candida albicans. Moreover, the isolates L. salivarius BGHO1 and L. gasseri BGHO89 were tolerant to low pH and high concentration of bile salts. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these findings imply that L. salivarius BGHO1 and L. gasseri BGHO89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.
TI  - Caries-related plaque microcosm biofilms developed in microplates.
AB  - In vivo dental plaque biofilms consist of complex communities of oral bacteria that are a challenge to replicate in vitro. The aim of this investigation was to establish human dental plaque microcosms in microplates to reflect conditions that are relevant to dental caries. Microcosm plaque biofilms were initiated from the saliva of two different donors, grown for up to 10 days in 24-welled microplates on Thermanox coverslips in various types of artificial saliva with and without sucrose, which were replaced daily. Microbiota composition of 40 species associated with oral health and dental caries was monitored in the plaques using Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization analysis. pH was measured as an indicator of cariogenic potential. The composition of the saliva inocula was different, and yielded plaque microcosms with different composition and growth responses to sucrose. Artificial saliva type and presence of sucrose, and the resulting growth and pH conditions, modified the growth of individual species and hence the ecological profile of the microplate plaques during development. Complex population shifts were observed during development, and older plaques comprised predominantly facultative anaerobic species. Sucrose supplementation limited the decline of Streptococci over time but did not increase the abundance of mutans Streptococci. Sucrose at 0.15% increased levels of caries-associated species including Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Actinomyces gerensceriae; these were further increased with sucrose at 0.5%, in addition to Actinomyces israelii, Rothia dentocariosa and Capnocytophaga gingivalis. The microplate plaques demonstrated complex community dynamics that appeared to reflect the maturation of natural plaques, and sucrose induced a cariogenic plaque composition and pH.
TI  - In vitro growth control of selected pathogens by Lactobacillus acidophilus- and Lactobacillus casei-fermented milk.
AB  - AIMS: Food-borne pathogen inhibition was tested in the presence of a mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei during fermentation under controlled pH conditions. METHODS AND RESULTS: The growth of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella serotype Typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria innocua, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis was evaluated for 48 h at 37 degrees C. In the presence of the lactic acid bacteria (LAB), an increase of the generation time was observed for all the gram-positive bacteria evaluated. Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive strain showing an increase of the generation time by 210%. However, for all the gram-negative bacteria evaluated, no inhibition occurred after 8 h of fermentation. The soluble portion of Lact. acidophilus- and Lact. casei-fermented milk was recuperated and tested for its antimicrobial activity. Listeria innocua and Staph. aureus were the most sensitive to the presence of fermented milk supernatant showing an inhibition of 85.9% and 84.7%, respectively. This soluble fraction was neutralized to eliminate the antimicrobial effect of the organic acids produced; the most sensitive strains were L. innocua and E. coli O157:H7 showing an inhibition of 65.9% and 61.9%, respectively. Finally, the soluble fraction was neutralized and irradiated at 45 kGy using a (60)Co source to eliminate the possible antimicrobial effect of both organic acids and bacteriocin-like substances. Enterococcus faecalis, E. coli O157:H7 and Staph. aureus were the most affected bacteria by this fraction, showing 39.1, 32 and 31.2% inhibition, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in this study suggest the implication of both organic acids and bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances in the antimicrobial activity observed in the soluble fraction of the probiotic preparation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study revealed the antimicrobial mechanisms of action of Lact. acidophilus- and Lact. casei-fermented milk used to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
TI  - A nonviable preparation of Lactobacillus acidophilus is not a probiotic.
AB  
TI  - Meta-analysis of probiotics for the prevention of traveler's diarrhea.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Traveler's diarrhea (TD) is a common health complaint among travelers. Rates of TD can range from 5% to 50%, depending on the destination. The use of probiotics for this disease remains controversial. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of probiotics for the prevention of TD based on published randomized, controlled clinical trials. METHODS: PubMed, Google Scholar, metaRegister, NIH registry of clinical trials and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from 1977 to 2005, unrestricted by language. Secondary searches of reference lists, authors, reviews, commentaries, associated diseases, books and meeting abstracts. Inclusion criteria included: randomization, controlled, blinded, efficacy trials, in humans, peer-reviewed journals. Exclusion criteria were: pre-clinical, safety, phase 1 studies in volunteers, reviews, duplicate reports, trials of unspecified probiotics, trials of prebiotics, and inconsistent outcome measures. RESULTS: Twelve of 940 screened studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The pooled relative risk indicates that probiotics significantly prevent TD (RR=0.85, 95% CI 0.79,0.91, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Several probiotics (Saccharomyces boulardii and a mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum) had significant efficacy. No serious adverse reactions were reported in the 12 trials. Probiotics may offer a safe and effective method to prevent TD.
TI  - [Antagonistic effect of bacteriocinogenic Lactobacillus acidophilus on Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii and Proteus mirabilis cells].
AB  - Data of the ultrastructural cellular changes of conditionally pathogenic enterobacteria, including K. pneumoniae, C. freundii and P. mirabilis cells impacts to bacteriocin-producing L. acidophilus are presented. Enterobacteria in response to the bacteriocinogenic effect of lactobacilli are manifestated by expressive destructions of sensitive to pore formation bacteriocin cells. Various morphological types of enterobacteria cells with increase of involution, lysing and resting forms are revealed. The specific ultrastructural changes of enterobacteria cells which evidencing the significant destructive processes of the cells membranes are detected. The destabilization of cellular wall in expansion periplasmic spaces and appearance of the ultrastructural reorganization of bacterial cells nucleoid also are registrated. Revealing the mechanism of lactobacilli secreted bacteriocin action to conditionally pathogenic enterobacteria might provide new ways to select the effective highly antagonistic probiotic strains.
TI  - FOXP3 mRNA expression at 6 months of age is higher in infants who develop atopic  dermatitis, but is not affected by giving probiotics from birth.
AB  - Factors that influence immune regulation in early life may be implicated in the rise in allergic disease, including reduced microbial burden. The aim of the study was to examine the infant regulatory T-cell function in relation to (a) probiotic supplementation for the first 6 months of life and (b) the subsequent development of an early allergic phenotype. Two hundred and thirty-one allergic, pregnant women were recruited into a randomized, controlled trial. The infants received either a probiotic or placebo daily for the first 6 months of life. One hundred and seventy-eight children completed the study, with blood samples available from 118 (60 placebo; 58 probiotic). CD4(+)CD25(+)CTLA4(+)T-regulatory phenotype and allergen-induced FOXP3 mRNA expression were compared in relation to this intervention as well as according to evidence of early disease (atopic dermatitis). The administration of probiotics was not associated with any significant differences in the proportion of circulating CD4(+)CD25(+)CTLA4(+)cells, or in the resting expression of FOXP3. There were also no relationships between these parameters and patterns of gut colonization, and this probiotic did not reduce the risk of atopic dermatitis. Children who developed atopic dermatitis (n = 36/118) had significantly higher induced FOXP3 expression following stimulation with both house dust mite (HDM) (p = 0.017) and ovalbumin (OVA) allergens (p = 0.021) than those that did not develop atopic dermatitis. Although this relationship was seen in both the probiotic and placebo groups, it was more pronounced in the probiotic group. However, regression analysis demonstrated that higher allergen-induced FOXP3 expression was predicted by the presence of atopic dermatitis (p = 0.018) rather than probiotics supplementation (p = 0.217). The higher levels of allergen-induced FOXP3 in atopic dermatitis suggest activation of these compensatory mechanisms rather than a primary defect in this pathway. Probiotic supplementation and gut colonization did not appear to substantially modify these regulatory pathways, or the risk of developing atopic dermatitis.
TI  - Formation of oligosaccharides in skim milk fermented with mixed dahi cultures, Lactococcus lactis ssp diacetylactis and probiotic strains of lactobacilli.
AB  - Milk fermented with mixed dahi cultures NCDC167, Lactococcus lactis ssp diacetylactis NCDC60 and two probiotic strains; Lactobacillus acidophilus NCDC14 and Lb. casei NCDC19 were evaluated after fermentation (14 h) and during 8 d storage at 7 degrees C. The beta-galactosidase activity was found to increase after fermentation leading to the hydrolysis of lactose and production of glucose, galactose and oligosaccharides; that subsequently decreased during storage. The viable counts of lactococci and lactobacilli decreased during storage yet remained >106 cfu/ml after storage. The results of present study indicate that all the selected cultures have ability to produce oligosaccharides (prebiotics) due to transgalactosidal and lactose hydrolysis activities of beta-galactosidase. The cultures developed an active synbiotic formula by maintaining sufficient probiotic viable counts to exert health benefits to the consumers.
TI  - The S-layer proteins of Lactobacillus crispatus strain ZJ001 is responsible for competitive exclusion against Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - Lactobacillus crispatus ZJ001, isolated from pig intestines and identified by sequencing analysis based on partial 16S rRNA gene, was examined in vitro for probiotic activity exerted by the surface layer proteins (S-layer). The characteristics of L. crispatus ZJ001 were compared to Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 from the same genus which also produces the S-layer proteins. The strain ZJ001 was resistant to acidic condition and bile salt. Its antagonistic properties such as adhesion, inhibition of the pathogen growth and competitive exclusion against Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella typhimurium were apparently advantageous over L. acidophilus ATCC 4356. SDS-PAGE analysis of cell surface proteins revealed the presence of S-layer proteins, approximately at 42 kDa in L. crispatus ZJ001. Removal of the S-layer proteins reduced autoaggregation and adhesion to HeLa cells. The functional role of the S-layer proteins in adhesion was also confirmed by the antibody-mediated inhibition assay using the polyclonal antibody against the S-layer protein. The S-layer proteins from L. crispatus ZJ001 inhibited adhesion of S. typhimurium and E. coli O157:H7 to HeLa cells. These results suggest that L. crispatus ZJ001 possesses probiotic properties and the S-layer proteins are involved in the adhesion and competitive exclusion of pathogens to HeLa cells.
TI  - Spotlight on VSL#3 probiotic mixture in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  - VSL#3 (VSL#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium longum, B. breve, and B. infantis), and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. Data from noncomparative trials suggest that VSL#3 has clinical potential in the treatment of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. In addition, a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial showed that VSL#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown VSL#3 is effective in preventing the onset of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. Treatment guidelines from the US and the UK include VSL#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. In general, VSL#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. Large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of VSL#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.
TI  - Production of yoghurt with mild taste by a Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus mutant with altered proteolytic properties.
AB  - In this communication, we describe the isolation of a Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 92063 mutant strain named pH-P11, which differed from the parent strain by low proteolytic activity and altered regulation of expression of lacZ in the presence of glucose or lactose. In the presence of lactose, beta-galactosidase activity was approximately twice as high in pH-P11 than in the wild type. pH-P11 exhibited protosymbiosis together with Streptococcus thermophilus. Yoghurt produced with pH-P11 was characterized by low acidity and little post-acidification during storage. The organoleptic properties (absence of bitterness and other off-flavors, weak sourness, and clear yoghurt taste) were those of a typical "yoghurt mild". This mild flavor was achieved at rather high cell counts of lactobacilli even at the end of shelf-life. High cell counts in conjunction with high beta-galactosidase activity make pH-P11 an interesting strain for application in yoghurt especially designed for consumers with lactose malabsorption. In contrast to "yoghurt mild", which is predominantly produced with Lactobacillus acidophilus together with Streptococcus thermophilus, the product obtained by fermentation with pH-P11 and Streptococcus thermophilus concurs with international standards for yoghurt. During frequent sub-culturing, strain pH-P11, which is supposed to differ from the wild type by one or a few so-far-not-characterized mutations, showed sufficient stability for application in industrial production.
TI  - Mode of action of acidocin D20079, a bacteriocin produced by the potential probiotic strain, Lactobacillus acidophilus DSM 20079.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus DSM 20079 is the producer of a novel bacteriocin termed acidocin D20079. In this paper, mode of action using three various concentrations of acidocin D20079 (2,048, 128 and 11.3 AU/ml) was determined against an indicator strain L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis DSM 20076. These concentrations all led to marked decreases in both the number of viable cells and in optical density, indicating that the activity of the acidocin D20079 was bactericidal with concomitant cell lysis. Moreover, the probiotic potential of L. acidophilus DSM 20079 was analyzed for its ability to survive and retain viability at conditions (acid and bile concentrations) mimicking the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, under which it survived exposure to pH 2.0 with a 1.2 log cycle reduction in viability and where 45% of the original population survived in a medium containing 0.3% bile for 3 h.
TI  - Are probiotics effective in the treatment of fungal colonization of the gastrointestinal tract? Experimental and clinical studies.
AB  - The influence of fungal colonization and probiotic treatment on the course of gastric ulcer (GU) and ulcerative colitis (UC) was not explored. Our studies included: 1) clinical investigation of 293 patients with dyspeptic and ulcer complaints and 72 patients with lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract: 60 patients with UC, 12 with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) - the control group. Significant fungal colonization (SFC), over 10(5) CFU/ml was evaluated. Mycological investigation was performed, including qualitative and quantitative examination, according to Muller method, 2) experimental studies in rats included estimation of the influence of inoculation of Candida isolated from human GI tract on the healing process of GU, induced by acetic acid with or without probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus (10(6) CFU/ml) introduced intragastrically (i.g.). At 0, 4, 15 and 25 day after ulcer induction. Weight, damage area, gastric blood flow (GBF) (H2 clearance), expression of mRNA for cytokines IL-beta, TNF-alpha (ELISA) were evaluated. Mycology: qualitative and quantitative examination was performed. MPO serum activity was measured. Results of clinical studies: 1) SFC was more frequent in patients with GU: 54.2% of cases and patients with over 5 years history of UC: 33.3% cases. 2) SFC delayed GU healing and influenced the maintenance of clinical symptoms in both diseases. Results of animal studies: 3) In Candida inoculated rats, the GBF was significantly lower than in the vehicle controls (saline administered group). Upregulation of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta was recorded. The GUs were still present till 25 day in all rats inoculated with Candida, in contrast to vehicle group (reduction of ulcer in 92% at day 25). CONCLUSIONS: 1) Fungal colonization delays process of ulcer and inflammation healing of GI tract mucosa. That effect was attenuated by probiotic therapy. 2) Probiotic therapy seems to be effective in treatment of fungal colonization of GI tract. 3) Lactobacillus acidophilus therapy shortens the duration of fungal colonization of mucosa (enhanced Candida clearance is associated with IL-4, INF-gamma response).
TI  - Combined effect of different lactic acid bacteria strains on the mode of cytokines pattern expression in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
AB  - The balance between immunogenic and tolerogenic activities in human immune system strongly depends on microflora-induced pro-and anti-inflammatory activities. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are important components of microflora. The interactions of the different strains of LAB and the cells of immune system are largely unknown. To assess if LAB strains composition would have an effect on the cellular responses profile (proliferation, cytokines synthesis) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) model system was used. PBMC were induced by three different strains of LAB: Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii spp. bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium bifidum. Tested strains were mixed together, in combinations with each other (pairs) or alone. Both, the LAB mixture as well as the pairs and the single LAB strains induced low lymphocyte proliferation (about 10% of ConA-induced response). However, the single LAB strains and their combinations were quite different cytokines inducers. First, L. acidophilus was much stronger IFN-gamma inducer than the LAB mixture, being a few times higher IL-12 stimulator than L. bulgaricus and B. bifidum. Second, L. bulgaricus and B. bifidum suppressed L.acidophilus-induced IFN-gamma synthesis to the level equal to that induced by the LAB mixture, limiting IL-12 production by about 30% and 70%, respectively. Third, the LAB strains were good IL-10 and TNF-alpha inducers, irrespectively of their combinations used. We conclude that LAB strains' pro or anti-inflammatory potentials are at least in part dependent on their composition. Low LAB mixture-induced IL-12 and IFN-gamma production and relatively high IL-10 and TNF-alpha expression may represent cellular activities normally induced in vivo by a combined action of bacterial antigens. Their presence is important to limit pro-inflammatory reactions (via IL-10) and to provide protection against infections (via TNF-alpha).
TI  - Characterization and molecular cloning of a heterodimeric beta-galactosidase from the probiotic strain Lactobacillus acidophilus R22.
AB  - Beta-galactosidase from the probiotic strain Lactobacillus acidophilus R22 was purified to apparent homogeneity by ammonium sulphate fractionation, hydrophobic interaction, and affinity chromatography. The enzyme is a heterodimer consisting of two subunits of 35 and 72 kDa, as determined by gel electrophoresis. The optimum temperature of beta-galactosidase activity was 55 degrees C (10-min assay) and the range of pH 6.5-8, respectively, for both o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (oNPG) and lactose hydrolysis. The Km and Vmax values for lactose and oNPG were 4.04+/-0.26 mM, 28.8+/-0.2 micromol D-glucose released per min per mg protein, and 0.73+/-0.07 mM, 361+/-12 micromol o-nitrophenol released per min per mg protein, respectively. The enzyme was inhibited by high concentrations of oNPG with Ki,s=31.7+/-3.5 mM. The enzyme showed no specific requirements for metal ions, with the exception of Mg2+, which enhanced both activity and stability. The genes encoding this heterodimeric enzyme, lacL and lacM, were cloned, and compared with other beta-galactosidases from lactobacilli. Beta-galactosidase from L. acidophilus was used for the synthesis of prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) from lactose, with the maximum GOS yield of 38.5% of total sugars at about 75% lactose conversion.
TI  - Canine intestinal lactic acid bacteria agglutinated with concanavalin A.
AB  - Twenty-six out of 46 representative lactic acid bacteria (LAB) that we isolated from 36 dogs in a previous study were agglutinated by concanavalin A (ConA) at a concentration of 0.1563 mg/ml, while isolates did not agglutinate without the addition of ConA. Amongst the isolates, L. reuteri, L. mucosae, and E. canintestini agglutinated strongly, while L. gallinarum, L. kitasatonis, L. acidophilus, L. saerimneri, B. animalis ssp. animalis, P. acidilactici, and E. hirae did not agglutinate. ConA-agglutination of LAB was specifically inhibited by D-glucose, D-galactose, and D-mannose at a concentration of 1.563 mg/ml. Among the sugars, ConA-agglutination was strongly inhibited by D-mannose, while the inhibition level by D-glucose and D-galactose were lower than that of D-mannose. ConA- agglutination of all the LAB isolates was inhibited by D-mannose, except for L. reuteri (one species) and L. mucosae (two species). ConA-agglutination of Bifidobacterium spp. was inhibited by only D-mannose. Based on our results, ConA-agglutination of LAB seems to be strain-specific, but not species-specific.
TI  - Probiotic supplementation for the first 6 months of life fails to reduce the risk of atopic dermatitis and increases the risk of allergen sensitization in high-risk children: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite preliminary evidence, the role of probiotics in allergy prevention is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether early probiotic supplementation prevents allergic disease in high-risk infants. METHODS: Newborns of women with allergy (n = 231) received either Lactobacillus acidophilus (LAVRI-A1) or placebo daily for the first 6 months of life. Children were assessed for atopic dermatitis (AD) and other symptoms at 6 and 12 months and had allergen skin prick tests (SPT) at 12 months of age. RESULTS: A total of 178 infants completed the supplementation period. Those in the probiotic group showed significantly higher rates of Lactobacillus colonization (P = .039). At 6 months, AD rates were similar in the probiotic (n = 23/89; 25.8%) and placebo (n = 20/88; 22.7%) groups (P = .629). There was also no difference at 12 months, although the proportion of children with SPT+AD was significantly higher in the probiotic group (P = .045). At 12 months, the rate of sensitization was significantly higher in the probiotic group (P = .030). The presence of culturable Lactobacilli or Bifidobacterium in stools in the first month of life was not associated with the risk of subsequent sensitization or disease; however, the presence of Lactobacillus at 6 months of age was associated with increased risk of subsequent cow's milk sensitization (P = .012). CONCLUSION: Early probiotic supplementation with L acidophilus did not reduce the risk of AD in high-risk infants and was associated with increased allergen sensitization in infants receiving supplements. The long-term significance of the increased rate of sensitization needs to be investigated in further studies. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: These findings challenge the role of probiotics in allergy prevention.
TI  - Tetracycline susceptibility of the ingested Lactobacillus acidophilus LaCH-5 and  Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bb-12 strains during antibiotic/probiotic intervention.
AB  - We investigated the effects of oral therapy with doxycycline, a tetracycline group antibiotic, on the gastrointestinal (GI) survival and tetracycline susceptibility of probiotic strains Lactobacillus acidophilus LaCH-5 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bb-12. In addition, the influence of doxycycline therapy on the diversity of the predominant faecal microbiota was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). Faecal samples from the antibiotic group (receiving antibiotics and probiotics) and the control group (receiving probiotics only) were analysed for anaerobically and aerobically growing bacteria, bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria as well as for the dominant microbiota. Although doxycycline consumption did not have a large impact on GI survival of the probiotics, it had a detrimental effect on the bifidobacteria and on the diversity of the dominant faecal microbiota. A higher proportion of tetracycline-resistant anaerobically growing bacteria and bifidobacteria was detected in the antibiotic group than in the control group. Several antibiotic group subjects had faecal B. animalis subsp. lactis Bb-12-like isolates with reduced tetracycline susceptibility. This was unlikely to be due to the acquisition of novel tetracycline resistance determinants, since only tet(W), which is also present in the ingested B. animalis subsp. lactis Bb-12, was found in the resistant isolates. Thus, concomitant ingestion of probiotic L. acidophilus LaCH-5 and B. animalis subsp. lactis Bb-12 with the antibiotic did not generate a safety risk regarding the possible GI transfer of tetracycline resistance genes to the ingested strains.
TI  - Identification and antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial isolates from probiotic products available in Italy.
AB  - This study was carried out to assay the bacterial viability and the probable contamination of a range of probiotic products available in Italy and to test the susceptibility of the isolates. Eleven dried food supplements and five fermented functional foods were examined using different isolation media under standardized cultivation conditions. The identification was made by conventional phenotypic characteristics and biochemical tests. Among isolates from the probiotic products antibiotic susceptibility was detected using the E-test (ABBiodisk). Our results demonstrate that nine food supplements and two fermented foods claimed species which could not be isolated, whereas potential pathogens (i.e. Micromonas micros) were isolated. Lactobacilli displayed species-dependent antibiotic resistance. Atypical resistance occurred for penicillin in Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus and for erythromycin in Lactobacillus lactis and Lactobacillus salivarius. A broad range of MICs was observed for cephalosporins and fluroquinolones. Aminoglycosides had poor activity against Lactobacillus isolates. Two of the four isolates of Bifidobacterium exhibited high resistance to trimethroprim/sulfametoxazole and to fluoroquinolones. Our results suggest that some probiotic products claim species that cannot always be isolated, and are sometimes contaminated by potential pathogens. Moreover, the probable transferable erythromycin or penicillin resistance among the lactobacilli isolated should be taken into account.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance of lactic acid bacteria and Bifidobacterium spp. isolated from dairy and pharmaceutical products.
AB  - The outlines of antibiotic resistance of some probiotic microorganisms were studied. This study was conducted with the double purpose of verifying their ability to survive if they are taken simultaneously with an antibiotic therapy and to increase the selective properties of suitable media for the isolation of samples containing mixed bacterial populations. We isolated from commercial dairy and pharmaceutical products, 34 strains declared as probiotics, belonging to the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, and 21 strains of starter culture bacteria. All the microorganisms have been compared by electrophoresis of the soluble proteins for the purpose of identifying them. A Multiplex-PCR with genus- and species-specific primers was used to detect for Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis presence. All bifidobacteria were B. animalis subsp. lactis except one Bifidobacterium longum. Sometimes the identification showed that the used strain was not the one indicated on the label. The lactobacilli were Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. The streptococci were all Streptococcus thermophilus. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 24 common antibiotic substances has been valued by the broth microdilution method. All tested strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, clindamycin, dicloxacillin, erytromycin, novobiocin, penicillin G, rifampicin (MIC(90) ranging from 0.01 to 4 microg/ml); resistant to aztreonam, cycloserin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, polymyxin B and spectinomycin (MIC(90) ranging from 64 to >1000 microg/ml). The susceptibility to cephalothin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, lincomycin, metronidazole, neomycin, paromomycin, streptomycin, tetracycline and vancomycin was variable and depending on the species.
TI  - Candidiasis (vulvovaginal).
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vulvovaginal candidiasis is estimated to be the second most common  cause of vaginitis after bacterial vaginosis. Candida albicans accounts for 85-90% of cases. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of drug treatments, alternative or complementary treatments for acute vulvovaginal candidiasis in non-pregnant symptomatic women? What are the effects of treating a male sexual partner to resolve symptoms and prevent recurrence in non-pregnant women with symptomatic acute vulvovaginal candidiasis? What are the effects of drug treatments, alternative or complementary treatments for recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis in non-pregnant symptomatic women? What are the effects of treating a male sexual partner in non-pregnant women with symptomatic recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis? What are the effects of treating asymptomatic non-pregnant women with a positive swab for candidiasis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to October 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 58 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: alternative or complementary treatments, douching, drug treatments, garlic, intravaginal preparations (boric acid, nystatin, imidazoles, tea tree oil), oral fluconazole, oral itraconazole, treating a male sexual partner, and yoghurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus (oral or vaginal).
TI  - Development of antioxidant activity in milk whey during fermentation with lactic  acid bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the production of antioxidant activity during fermentation with commonly used dairy starter cultures. Moreover, to study the development of antioxidant activity during fermentation, and the connection to proteolysis and bacterial growth. METHODS AND RESULTS: Antioxidant activity was measured by analysing the radical scavenging activity using a spectrophotometric decolorization assay and lipid peroxidation inhibition was assayed using liposomal model system with a fluorescence method. Milk was fermented with 25 lactic acid bacterial (LAB) strains, and from these six strains, exhibiting the highest radical scavenging activity was selected for further investigation. Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris strains, Lactobacillus jensenii (ATCC 25258) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (ATCC 4356) showed the highest activity with both the methods used. However, the radical scavenging activity was stronger than lipid peroxidation inhibition activity. The development of radical scavenging activity was connected to proteolysis with four strains. Molecular distribution profiles showed that fermentates with high scavenging activity also possessed a higher proportion of peptides in the molecular mass range of 4-20 kDa, while others had mostly large polypeptides and compounds below 4 kDa. In addition, the amount of hydrophobic amino acids was higher in these fermentates. CONCLUSIONS: The development of antioxidant activity was strain-specific characteristic. The development of radical scavengers was more connected to the simultaneous development of proteolysis whereas, lipid peroxidation inhibitory activity was related to bacterial growth. However, high radical scavenging activity was not directly connected to the high degree of proteolysis. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: To the best of our knowledge, this seems to be the first report, which screens possible antioxidant activity among most common dairy LAB strains. Use of such strains improve nutritional value of fermented dairy products.
TI  - Immune effect of heat-killed multistrain of Lactobacillus acidophilus against Salmonella typhimurium invasion to mice.
AB  - AIMS: This study attempted to determine whether lactic acid bacteria (LAB) could  have a better probiotic function when used as a multistrain mixture, i.e. Mix-LAB, than when used as a monostrain. To this end, three strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, specifically strain LAP5, LAF1 and LAH7, were heat-killed and mixed. This heat-killed Mix-LAB was used to evaluate the effectiveness of multistrain in inhibiting Salmonella invasion into cultured cells and into organs (spleen and liver) of live mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: BALB/c mice were orally administered with heat-killed Mix-LAB or sterile normal saline (control) for seven consecutive days and then challenged with orally administered Salmonella typhimurium on day 8. Results showed that, at day 6 after the challenge, the mice which had received Mix-LAB exhibited lower rates (P < 0.05) of Salmonella invasion into liver and spleen than did the control mice. Also, before the Salmonella challenge, the serum tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels were not significantly different (P > 0.05) between these two groups of mice. After the challenge, however, the serum TNF-alpha level was significantly elevated (P < 0.05) in the control group, but not significantly changed in the Mix-LAB fed mice. To investigate possible factors involved in heat-killed Mix-LABs antagonistic effect on Salmonella invasion of mouse organs, heat-killed single strain and Mix-LAB were evaluated for ability to inhibit Salmonella invasion into cultured human intestinal Int-407 and Caco-2 cells. Results showed that none of the heat-killed strains were able to protect these cultured cells from Salmonella invasion, even though strains of LAP5 and Mix-LAB were adherent to them. However, study of the activation of murine macrophage Raw 264.7 cells showed that heat-killed Mix-LAB stimulated TNF-alpha production, nitric oxide release, and increased phagocytic activity in macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that heat-killed Mix-LAB can inhibit Salmonella invasion of mouse organs through the immunomodulating role of activated macrophage. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The ability of heat-killed Mix-LAB to prevent bacterial infection in mice was found to be more significant than that of viable monostrain. This effect may be due to the activation of the immune system rather than to the adherence of LAB to the intestine epithelium.
TI  - Incipient caries lesions on cementum by mono- and co-culture oral bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: There is increasing prevalence of root caries. We hypothesized different biofilms will cause varying demineralization in cementum. This study investigated the extent of demineralization of cementum by oral biofilm formed from three major cariogenic microorganisms: Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Actinomyces israelii. Sound cementum tooth blocks were incubated with mono-, bi-, and tri-species combinations of the bacteria under investigation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The matrix (amide I) and phosphate content of the lesions was analyzed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and calcium and phosphorus levels were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDX). RESULTS: The log[amide I:HPO(4)(2-) absorbance] values showed that A. israelii mono-culture caused significantly more demineralization than the other bacterial cultures. log[Ca:P] showed that all carious lesions were confined to the cementum. CONCLUSIONS: Oral biofilm arising from bacterial species A. israelii alone was the most cariogenic of those tested and produced the most demineralization in incipient carious lesions in cementum.
TI  - Isoflavone phytoestrogen degradation in fermented soymilk with selected beta-glucosidase producing L. acidophilus strains during storage at different temperatures.
AB  - Soymilk fermented with 3 selected Lactobacillus acidophilus strains were stored at various temperatures (-80 degrees C, 4 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 37 degrees C) for 8 weeks and the concentration of isoflavones determined weekly using RP-HPLC. The decreasing concentration of isoflavones in soymilk during storage due to degradation was found to fit the first order kinetics model. Isoflavone aglycones as well as isoflavone glucosides largely appeared to be stable during storage (P<0.01). Interestingly, the aglycone forms showed much smaller degradation as compared to glucoside forms at all the storage temperatures studied. Of the isoflavone aglycones, daidzein was found to be the most stable followed by genistein, while glycitein was least stable. Isoflavone aglycones such as glycitein, daidzein and genistein showed smaller degradation constants in fermented soymilk at lower storage temperatures (-80 degrees C and 4 degrees C) and higher degradation constants at higher storage temperatures (25 degrees C and 37 degrees C) with each strain. In contrast, glucosides glycitin and daidzin showed higher degradation at lower storage temperatures (-80 degrees C and 4 degrees C) and lower degradation at higher storage temperatures (25 degrees C and 37 degrees C). Storage temperature was therefore found to be very important in regulating the rate of degradation soy isoflavones in fermented soymilk.
TI  - [Influence of a xylanase feed additive on Lactobacillus species in the jejunum of piglets].
AB  - rRNA extracts from the jejunum of rearing piglets fed a wheat/rye based diet with or without a xylanase feed additive were hybridized against eight Lactobacillus spp. specific digoxigenin labelled oligonucleotide probes. Known concentrations of sample- or culture RNA extracts were used to calibrate and quantify hybridization signals from different sample extracts and hybridizations. The xylanase feed additive tended to increase total eubacterial rRNA in the terminal jejunum, probably a result of increased Lactobacillus spp. rRNA in the central and terminal jejunum. However, individual animal variations were high. L. reuteri was the major Lactobacillus species followed by L. acidophilus and L. mucosae. L. amylophilus and L. crispatus were not detected in all RNA extracts. The results of this study show that the xylanase feed additive modifies Lactobacillus spp. populations on the species level in piglets in addition to their well known effects on digesta viscosity and nutrient digestibility. The implications of these effects for the intestinal microbiota require further analysis.
TI  - [Lactofem--using of vital lactic acid bacteria in the cases of vaginal microflora imbalance].
AB  - The authors describe the microbiological content of the vaginal ecosystem in healthy, reproductive aged women, as well as women with different types of vaginitis, and the recovering possibilities that LACTOFEM offers. It contains vital H2O2 - producing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus rhamnosus.
TI  - Plasma cobalamin and folate and their metabolic markers methylmalonic acid and total homocysteine among Egyptian children before and after nutritional supplementation with the probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus in yoghurt matrix.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the biopotency of the viable probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus (La1) in yoghurt matrix consumed by Egyptian children on their plasma vitamin B12 and folate levels, and their metabolic markers methylmalonic acid (MMA) and total homocysteine (t-Hcy). METHODS: A randomized nutritional supplementation trial (42 days duration) was performed in free-living children of both sexes (11 years old). The La1 in yoghurt matrix was administered to provide 1012 colony-forming units/subject/day. Blood sampling for the analysis of plasma vitamin B12, folate and t-Hcy was performed by standardized methods. Five-hour urine collection was used for the analysis of MMA and t-Hcy. RESULTS: Initially 33.3% of the children presented with biochemical vitamin B12 deficiency (<208 pg/ml), while one-fifth (21%) were biochemically deficient in folate (<3 ng/ml folate/ml plasma or 0.68 nmol/l). Fifty percent of the children presented with high plasma t-Hcy (>15.0 micromol/l). The daily consumption of the probiotic La1 yoghurt for 42 days significantly improved the mean levels of plasma vitamin B12 (P<0.05) and folate (P<0.01) among the studied children compared with the respective baseline data. On the other hand, the average levels of plasma t-Hcy and urinary MMA decreased significantly (P<0.05) at the termination of the 42-day nutritional supplementation, compared with the respective initial mean levels. The consumption of the probiotic yoghurt was also associated with a significant (chi2=8.0; P<0.01) reduction in the percentage prevalence of anemia (hemoglobin <120 g/l). CONCLUSION: The long-term ingestion of viable probiotic La1 potentially promoted the overall nutritional status of the studied children.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus modulates intestinal pain and induces opioid and cannabinoid receptors.
AB  - Abdominal pain is common in the general population and, in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, is attributed to visceral hypersensitivity. We found that oral administration of specific Lactobacillus strains induced the expression of mu-opioid and cannabinoid receptors in intestinal epithelial cells, and mediated analgesic functions in the gut-similar to the effects of morphine. These results suggest that the microbiology of the intestinal tract influences our visceral perception, and suggest new approaches for the treatment of abdominal pain and irritable bowel syndrome.
TI  - Preharvest control of Escherichia coli O157 in cattle.
AB  - Bovine manure is an important source of Escherichia coli O157 contamination of the environment and foods; therefore, effective interventions targeted at reducing the prevalence and magnitude of fecal E. coli O157 excretion by live cattle (preharvest) are desirable. Preharvest intervention methods can be grouped into 3 categories: 1) exposure reduction strategies, 2) exclusion strategies, and 3) direct antipathogen strategies. Exposure reduction involves environmental management targeted at reducing bovine exposure to E. coli O157 through biosecurity and environmental niche management such as feed and drinking water hygiene, reduced exposure to insects or wildlife, and improved cleanliness of the bedding or pen floor. In the category of exclusion, we group vaccination and dietary modifications such as selection of specific feed components; feeding of prebiotics, probiotics, or both; and supplementation with competitive exclusion cultures to limit proliferation of E. coli O157 in or on exposed animals. Direct antipathogen strategies include treatment with sodium chlorate, antibiotics, bacteriophages, in addition to washing of animals before slaughter. Presently, only 1 preharvest control for E. coli O157 in cattle has been effective and has gained widespread adoption-the feeding probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus. More research into the effectiveness of parallel and simultaneous application of 1 or more preharvest control strategies, as well as the identification of new pre-harvest control methods, may provide practical means to substantially reduce the incidence of human E. coli O157-related illness by intervening at the farm level.
TI  - Similarity and differences in the Lactobacillus acidophilus group identified by polyphasic analysis and comparative genomics.
AB  - A set of lactobacilli were investigated by polyphasic analysis. Multilocus sequence analysis, DNA typing, microarray analysis, and in silico whole-genome alignments provided a remarkably consistent pattern of similarity within the Lactobacillus acidophilus complex. On microarray analysis, 17 and 5% of the genes from Lactobacillus johnsonii strain NCC533 represented variable and strain-specific genes, respectively, when tested against four independent isolates of L. johnsonii. When projected on the NCC533 genome map, about 10 large clusters of variable genes were identified, and they were enriched around the terminus of replication. A quarter of the variable genes and two-thirds of the strain-specific genes were associated with mobile DNA. Signatures for horizontal gene transfer and modular evolution were found in prophages and in DNA from the exopolysaccharide biosynthesis cluster. On microarray hybridizations, Lactobacillus gasseri strains showed a shift to significantly lower fluorescence intensities than the L. johnsonii test strains, and only genes encoding very conserved cellular functions from L. acidophilus hybridized to the L. johnsonii array. In-silico comparative genomics showed extensive protein sequence similarity and genome synteny of L. johnsonii with L. gasseri, L. acidophilus, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii; moderate synteny with Lactobacillus casei; and scattered X-type sharing of protein sequence identity with the other sequenced lactobacilli. The observation of a stepwise decrease in similarity between the members of the L. acidophilus group suggests a strong element of vertical evolution in a natural phylogenetic group. Modern whole-genome-based techniques are thus a useful adjunct to the clarification of taxonomical relationships in problematic bacterial groups.
TI  - Characterization of lactic acid bacteria and other gut bacteria in pigs by a macroarraying method.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) consist of many genera, Gram-positive, and nonspore-forming micro-organisms; some members being used as probiotics while some others have negative effects on pig health. Bacterial species in the gastrointestinal tract can produce antibacterial substances, reduce serum cholesterol in their host, or can be responsible for growth reduction, diarrhea, and intestinal epithelial damage. It is therefore important for the pig industry to evaluate the impact of food and farm management on the presence of "good" or "bad" bacteria and the risk for consumers. This articles focuses on the molecular identification of gut microflora species following different diets given to pigs in UK and correlating the data on growth, health, and welfare. First of all, pig feces were individually collected from sows before and after farrowing and also from piglets before and after weaning over several months. Bacteria colonies were grown on MRS agar plates from feces and DNA was extracted (QIAamp DNA stool kit) and amplified using 16S rDNA (27f and 519r) primers. DNA sequencing and sequence alignment allowed us to identify species-specific zones, which were used as probes in a macroarray system also known as reverse line blot hybridization. Some probes were found to be species specific for the following species: Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. animalis, L. gallinarum, L. kitasanotis, L salivarius, Streptococcus alactolyticus, S. hyointestinalis, and Sarcina ventriculi. Actual studies are now focusing on the impact of diets of the microflora in different gut parts and at different stages of the animal's life.
TI  - Immune enhancing effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus LAFTI L10 and Lactobacillus paracasei LAFTI L26 in mice.
AB  - The immune enhancing properties of Lactobacillus acidophilus LAFTI L10 and Lactobacillus paracasei LAFTI L26 in mice were investigated. Each mouse (BALB/c) was orally fed with cultures of either L. acidophilus or L. paracasei at 10(8) CFU/50 mul per day for 14 days. The effect of these strains on immunoglobulin A, interleukin-10 and interferon gamma producing cells in the gut immune system was determined by immunofluorescence assays. Systemic immune responses were analysed in mice serum upon euthanising after a 14-day feeding trial to estimate cytokines such as IL-10 and IFN-gamma by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. L. acidophilus and L. paracasei strains demonstrated an increase in the number of IgA producing cells, IL-10 and IFN-gamma cytokine producing cells in the small intestine. In the systemic immune response, mice fed with L. acidophilus or L. paracasei also enhanced the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) and pro-inflammatory cytokine (IFN-gamma). The results of this study suggest that L. acidophilus and L. paracasei were able to enhance specific gut and systemic immune responses in mice.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of acidified nitrate and nitrite on six common oral pathogens in vitro.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Salivary nitrate is positively correlated with plasma nitrate and its level is 9 times the plasma level after nitrate loading. Nitrate in saliva is known to be reduced to nitrite by oral bacteria. Nitrate and nitrite levels in saliva are 3 - 5 times those in serum in physiological conditions respectively in our previous study. The biological functions of high salivary nitrate and nitrite are still not well understood. The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the antimicrobial effects of nitrate and nitrite on main oral pathogens under acidic conditions. METHODS: Six common oral pathogens including Streptococcus mutans NCTC 10449, Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4646, Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277, Capnocytophaga gingivalis ATCC 33624, Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953, and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were cultured in liquid medium. Sodium nitrate or sodium nitrite was added to the medium to final concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 10 mmol/L. All of the microorganisms were incubated for 24 to 48 hours. The optical densities (OD) of cell suspensions were determined and the cultures were transferred to solid nutrient broth medium to observe the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration for the six tested pathogens. RESULTS: Nitrite at concentrations of 0.5 to 10 mmol/L had an inhibitory effect on all tested organisms at low pH values. The antimicrobial effect of nitrite increased with the acidity of the medium. Streptococcus mutans NCTC 10449 was highly sensitive to nitrite at low pH values. Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4646 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were relatively resistant to acidified nitrite. Nitrate at the given concentrations and under acidic conditions had no inhibitory effect on the growth of any of the tested pathogens. CONCLUSION: Nitrite, at a concentration equal to that in human saliva, is both cytocidal and cytostatic to six principal oral pathogens in vitro, whereas nitrate at a similar concentration has no antimicrobial effect on these organisms.
TI  - [Influence of selected Lactobacillus sp. on Clostridium difficile strains with different toxigenicity profile].
AB  - This study was performed for determination of antagonistic activity of Lactobacillus spp. (L. plantarum 2017405, L. rhamnosus GG, L. acidophilus DSM 21007 and L. fernmentumn 353) on Clostridiunl difficile strains belonging to different toxigenicity profiles. Forty strains C. difficile isolated from patients suffering from antibiotic associated diarrhea (AAD) were used. Among C. difficile strains 13 produced toxin A and B (A+B+CDT-), 14 produced only toxin B (AB'CDT), 9 produced toxins A and B and possessing of binary toxin genes (A+B+CDT-) and 4 were non-toxigenic (A-B-CDT-). We did not observe relationship between degree of antagonistic activity Lactobacillus spp. and profile of toxigenicity of C. difficile strains.
TI  - Biocatalysis of linoleic acid to conjugated linoleic acid.
AB  - CLA refers to a group of geometrical and positional isomers of linoleic acid (LA) with conjugated double bonds. CLA has been reported to have diverse health benefits and biological properties. Traditional organic synthesis is highly capital-intensive and results in an isomeric mixture of CLA isomers. Biotechnology presents new alternatives to traditional lipid manufacturing methods. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of protein isolation procedures on linoleate isomerase (LAI) recovery from microbial cells and biocatalysis of LA to CLA. Protein isolation experiments were carried out using Lactobacillus acidophilus L1 and two strains of Lactobacillus reuteri (ATCC 23272 and ATCC 55739). Under the same assay conditions, ATCC 55739 had the highest LAI activity among the microbial cultures examined in this study. Efficiency of cell lysis methods, which included various combinations of lysozyme and mutanolysin treatments in combination with sonication and osmotic rupture of cells with liquid nitrogen, was very low. Although treatment of cell material with a detergent (octylthioglucoyranoside) freed a significant amount of LAI activity into the solution, it was not sufficient to recover all the LAI activity from the residual cells. Crude LAI preparations produced mainly the cis-9,trans-11 CLA isomer. Time and substrate/protein ratio had a significant effect on biocatalysis of LA to CLA. It appears that the mechanism and kinetics of enzymatic conversion of LA to CLA are quite complex and requires further research using pure LAI preparations.
TI  - Isolation of microbial DNA by newly designed magnetic particles.
AB  - Carboxyl group-containing magnetic nonporous poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-glycidyl methacrylate) (P(HEMA-co-GMA)) microspheres and cobalt ferrite nanoparticles modified with alginic acid (natural carboxylic polysaccharide) were used for isolation of microbial DNA of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from dairy products, lyophilised cell cultures, and bacterial colonies grown on hard media, and Trichophyton fungi DNA from lyophilised cells. DNA from the samples with lysed cells was reversibly adsorbed to the particles in the presence of high poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG 6000) and sodium chloride concentrations. The optimal final PEG and NaCl concentrations were 9.1 wt.% and 2.0 M, respectively. The adsorbed DNA was released from the particles in low ionic strength TE buffer. The quality of isolated DNA was checked by PCR amplification. Moreover, PCR amplicons were isolated on cobalt ferrite nanoparticles modified with alginic acid and checked by restriction analysis.
TI  - Novel disulphide esters of carbothioic acid as potent, non-detergent spermicides  with low toxicity to Lactobacillus and HeLa cells in vitro.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The design, synthesis, characterization and evaluation of a novel series of non-detergent spermicides has led to the discovery of two unique molecules (DSE-36 and DSE-37) that were approximately 25 times more potent spermicides than nonoxynol-9 (N-9). METHODS: Normal human spermatozoa were used to assess the spermicidal activity (Sander-Cramer Assay), the effect on sperm-membrane integrity [hypo-osmotic swelling test (HOST)], supravital staining and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the induction of apoptosis [fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) Annexin-V and JC-1 labelling using flow cytometry] by the new class of compounds. HeLa and Lactobacillus cultures were used to assess the cytotoxicity of compounds and their compatibility to normal vaginal flora, respectively. RESULTS: Compounds DSE-36 and DSE-37 exhibited a strong spermicidal activity [minimum effective concentration (MEC) = 0.002%], which was approximately 25 times more potent than that of N-9 and Sapindus saponins (MEC = 0.05%). As compared with surfactants, DSE-36 and DSE-37 were found to be safer at MEC towards the growth and survival of Lactobacilli and HeLa cells in vitro and to have a milder effect on sperm plasma membrane. At EC(50) both induced apoptosis in sperm cells as characterized by increased labelling with Annexin-V and decreased polarization of sperm mitochondria. CONCLUSION: Preliminary studies have revealed that in sharp contrast to the non-specific surfactant action of N-9, DSE-36 and DSE-37 have a highly potent, mechanism-based, detrimental action on human sperm. The unique ability of these non-detergent molecules to selectively kill sperm and spare Lactobacilli and HeLa cells at MEC values much lower than that required for N-9 indicates their potential as superior ingredients for formulation into microbicidal contraceptives.
TI  - Influence of intensive and extensive breeding on lactic acid bacteria isolated from Gallus gallus domesticus ceca.
AB  - In the present study, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from the cecum of chickens bred  either under intensive (commercial broilers) or extensive (free-range) conditions were isolated, identified and some of their probiotic characteristics determined. The LAB identified by 16S-23S rRNA PCR-ARDRA were mainly of Lactobacillus species and to a lesser extent of Enterococcus spp. for all animals. Free-range chickens showed a higher presence of Lactobacillus acidophilus while Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus johnsonii were more frequently recovered from commercial broilers. Lactobacillus crispatus was found only in commercial broilers, Lactobacillus vaginalis and Lactobacillus agilis only in free-range chickens and Lactobacillus salivarius in both types. Enterococcus isolates from ceca of commercial broilers showed a higher resistance to antimicrobial drugs. Lactobacillus isolates from free-range chickens presented a higher frequency of in vitro antagonistic activity against selected pathogens than from commercial broilers. All LAB isolates had predominantly non-hydrophobic surfaces, but with variations depending on age of the chickens and breeding conditions. Animal breeding caused variation on composition, antimicrobial susceptibility, antagonistic activity and surface hydrophobicity of LAB from chicken cecum. LAB isolates from ceca of free-range chickens have potential as probiotic agents, which may be used in the future as replacing the use of antimicrobials as growth promoters.
TI  - Consumption of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium longum does not alter phytoestrogen metabolism and plasma hormones in men: a pilot study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether equol excretion status  and plasma hormone and leptin concentrations can be influenced by consumption of a probiotic supplement. A secondary focus was to investigate whether male equol excretors have a hormone profile consistent with reduced prostate cancer risk. DESIGN: The design was a randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm trial. SUBJECTS: Thirty-one (31) of the initially enrolled 39 subjects, 18 to 37 years old, completed all study requirements. INTERVENTION: Subjects consumed either probiotic capsules (containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium longum) or placebo capsules for 2 months. Fasting plasma concentrations of testosterone (T), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), androstanediol glucuronide (AAG), androstenedione (A), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and leptin were measured on days 1 and 57. Urinary excretion of genistein, glycitein, daidzein, O-desmethylangolensin (O-Dma), and equol was measured on days 4 and 61 following a 4-day soy challenge. RESULTS: Probiotic consumption did not significantly alter equol excretor status, plasma hormone, or leptin concentrations in these subjects. At baseline, there were no differences in plasma hormone concentrations between equol excretors and nonexcretors; however, the low number of equol excretors included in this study limits the strength of this finding. CONCLUSIONS: The 2-month intervention with probiotic capsules did not significantly alter equol excretion, plasma hormone, or leptin concentrations in these subjects. A secondary finding was that male equol excretors in this study did not exhibit a hormone profile consistent with reduced prostate cancer risk, although this result should be interpreted with caution.
TI  - Treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. A case control experience.
AB  - AIM: As optimal therapy for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) remains elusive, current approach to therapy is based on symptomatic treatment. With this case-control experience we wanted to determine the beneficial effect in IBS patients of a dietary integrator (IBS Active), composed of L-tryptophan, inulin, angelica, vegetal charcoal, vitamin PP, group B vitamins (B1, B2, B6) and probiotics (Lactobacillus sporogenes, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus thermophilus). METHODS: The treatment group comprised 37 patients (11 men and 27 women; mean age, 44.3+/-5.1 years) given IBS Active (440 mg bid) over a mean period of 6 months (range, 5-8). The control group comprised 28 patients (6 men and 22 women; mean age, 48.6+/-3.7 years) who were instructed to continue their customary therapy for 6 months (range, 5-7). All subjects were assessed for the presence of abdominal pain and/or distension, constipation, diarrhea and alternating constipation and diarrhea. RESULTS: Compared with baseline values, the reduction in abdominal pain in the treatment group was 62% (P<0.0001), 55% (P<0.0001) in abdominal distension, 58% (P=0.05) in constipation, 33% (P=0.3) in diarrhea, and 62% (P=0.01) in alternation constipation and diarrhea. Compared with baseline values, no statistically significant reduction in symptoms was found in the control group. Post-treatment comparison between the two groups showed that the study product had reduced symptoms and that the difference was statistically significant for abdominal pain (P<0.000001), abdominal distension (P=0.003) and constipation (P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The use of IBS Active led to a significant improvement in pain symptoms, abdominal distension and regulation of bowel movement in IBS patients. Further study is needed to evaluate the long-term benefit of the study product.
TI  - Inhibition of pathogenic bacterial adhesion by acidic polysaccharide from green tea (Camellia sinensis).
AB  - An acidic polysaccharide CS-F2 from Camellia sinensis was examined to characterize its anti-adhesive effects against pathogenic bacteria, most notably Helicobacter pylori, Propionibacterium acnes, and Staphylococcus aureus. CS-F2 showed marked inhibitory activity against the pathogen-mediated hemagglutination with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) between 0.01 and 0.1 mg/mL, which is lower than the previously reported MIC values for Panax ginseng and Artemisia capillaris. The inhibitory effects of CS-F2 on the adhesion of H. pylori to AGS adenocarcinoma gastric epithelial cells, or P. acnes and S. aureus to NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells, were further assessed resulting in MIC values between 0.063 and 0.13 mg/mL. Importantly, CS-F2 showed no inhibitory effects against Lactobacillus acidophilus, Escherichia coli, or Staphylococcus epidermidis. Our results suggest that CS-F2, which is a pectin-type polysaccharide with a molecular weight of approximately 8.0 x 10(4) Da, may exert a selective anti-adhesive effect against certain pathogenic bacteria, while exerting no effects against beneficial and commensal bacteria.
TI  - Antidiabetic effect of probiotic dahi containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei in high fructose fed rats.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect of low-fat (2.5%) dahi containing probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei on progression of high fructose-induced type 2 diabetes in rats. METHODS: Diabetes was induced in male albino Wistar rats by feeding 21% fructose in water. The body weight, food and water intakes, fasting blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, oral glucose tolerance test, plasma insulin, liver glycogen content, and blood lipid profile were recorded. The oxidative status in terms of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and reduced glutathione contents in liver and pancreatic tissues were also measured. RESULTS: Values for blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, glucose intolerance, plasma insulin, liver glycogen, plasma total cholesterol, triacylglycerol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and blood free fatty acids were increased significantly after 8 wk of high fructose feeding; however, the dahi-supplemented diet restricted the elevation of these parameters in comparison with the high fructose-fed control group. In contrast, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased slightly and was retained in the dahi-fed group. The dahi-fed group also exhibited lower values of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and higher values of reduced glutathione in liver and pancreatic tissues compared with the high fructose-fed control group. CONCLUSION: The probiotic dahi-supplemented diet significantly delayed the onset of glucose intolerance, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, and oxidative stress in high fructose-induced diabetic rats, indicating a lower risk of diabetes and its complications.
TI  - Diversity of the genus Lactobacillus revealed by comparative genomics of five species.
AB  - The genus Lactobacillus contains over 80 recognized species, and is characterized by a high level of diversity, reflected in its complex phylogeny. The authors' recent determination of the genome sequence of Lactobacillus salivarius means that five complete genomes of Lactobacillus species are available for comparative genomics: L. salivarius, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. johnsonii and L. sakei. This paper now shows that there is no extensive synteny of the genome sequences of these five lactobacilli. Phylogeny based on whole-genome alignments suggested that L. salivarius was closer to L. plantarum than to L. sakei, which was closest to Enterococcus faecalis, in contrast to 16S rRNA gene relatedness. A total of 593 orthologues common to all five species were identified. Species relatedness based on this protein set was largely concordant with genome synteny-based relatedness. A Lactobacillus supertree, combining individual phylogenetic trees from each of 354 core proteins, had four main branches, comprising L. salivarius-L. plantarum; L. sakei; E. faecalis; and L. acidophilus-L. johnsonii. The extreme divergence of the Lactobacillus genomes analysed supports the recognition of new subgeneric divisions.
TI  - Red autofluorescence of dental plaque bacteria.
AB  - Red autofluorescence of plaque and its relation to fluorescence of a single species in the biofilm was studied. Fluorescence images of non-disclosed and disclosed plaque of 28 first-year students were captured. The plaque samples were assessed by culture methods and studied for red autofluorescence. Species capable of producing red autofluorescence were cultivated from subjects with and without red plaque autofluorescence. Red autofluorescence was observed from Actinomyces odontolyticus, Prevotella intermedia and from Porphyromonas gingivalis and Peptostreptococcus micros grown together. The microbial findings indicated that the intrinsic characteristics of the mature biofilm itself are more responsible for the red autofluorescence than the characteristics of the single species.
TI  - Hydrogen peroxide production and resistance to nonoxinol-9 in Lactobacillus spp.  isolated from the vagina of reproductive-age women.
AB  - Lactic acid production is considered to be the major protection mechanism of lactobacilli against vaginal infections due to genital pathogens. However, some species of Lactobacillus are also hydrogen peroxide-producers. Women, who usually use intrauterine dispositive (IUD) and spermicides such as nonoxinol-9 (N-9) as contraceptive methods, increase the risk of acquiring an urinary tract infection and a bacterial vaginosis; some studies have demonstrated that these compounds alter the normal vaginal biota. It is known that they inhibit lactobacilli in vitro at concentrations of 0.1% to 1% and that they do not have an effect on the growth of Escherichia coli. It is probable that the presence of nonoxinol-9 affects the ecological balance of the vagina by inhibiting the protector lactobacilli. In this study, we identified Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. brevis, L. crispatus, L. fermentii and L. jensenii as the species most frequently isolated from women. Seventy-one hydrogen peroxide-producer strains and 48 strains resistant to the inhibitory effect of nonoxinol-9 were detected. L. brevis showed the highest number of resistant strains.
TI  - Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginal microbiota of healthy women inhibit Prevotella bivia and Gardnerella vaginalis in coculture and cell culture.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate how human vaginal isolates of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus crispatus inhibit the vaginosis-associated pathogens Gardnerella vaginalis and Prevotella bivia. Results show that all the strains in coculture condition reduced the viability of G. vaginalis and P. bivia, but with differing degrees of efficacy. The treatment of G. vaginalis- and P. bivia-infected cultured human cervix epithelial HeLa cells with L. gasseri strain KS120.1 culture or cell-free culture supernatant (CFCS) results in the killing of the pathogens that are adhering to the cells. The mechanism of the killing activity is not attributable to low pH and the presence of lactic acid alone, but rather to the presence of hydrogen peroxide and proteolytic enzyme-resistant compound(s) present in the CFCSs. In addition, coculture of G. vaginalis or P. bivia with L. gasseri KS120.1 culture or KS120.1 bacteria results in inhibition of the adhesion of the pathogens onto HeLa cells.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of non-enterococcal intrinsic glycopeptide-resistant Gram-positive organisms.
AB  - Non-enterococcal Gram-positive bacteria that are intrinsically vancomycin-resistant have been infrequently isolated in association with serious infections. However, well-documented infections have lately been reported with increasing frequency. Because these organisms may be pathogens, we tested the MICs of 19 antimicrobial agents by the agar dilution method for predicting susceptibility. The activity of these antimicrobial agents was assessed against 28 strains (Lactobacillus rhamnosus, 6; Lactobacillus acidophilus, 1; Lactobacillus casei, 1; Lactobacillus fermentum, 2; Lactobacillus brevis, 1; Lactobacillus plantarum, 1; Weissella confusa, 2; Leuconostoc mesenteroides, 7; Leuconostoc lactis, 4; Pediococcus acidilactici, 2; Pediococcus pentosaceus, 1), isolated from clinical specimens in an Argentinian university hospital from 1997 to 2003. The MICs of penicillin for 67% of the Lactobacillus strains and 100% of the Leuconostoc spp. and Pediococcus spp. strains tested were in the 0.25-2 microg/mL range. Erythromycin was the most active antimicrobial overall. Multiresistance was observed in 2 strains (Lactobacillus rhamnosus, 1; Lactobacillus plantarum, 1).
TI  - Efficacy of Helicobacter pylori eradication taking into account its resistance to antibiotics.
AB  - The discovery of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) provided a possibility to cure effectively patients with peptic ulcers. Recent studies have shown varying susceptibility of H. pylori strains to antibiotics and increasing resistance to some of the recommended drugs. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of the currently recommended eradication schemes and to assess the increasing resistance of H. pylori strains to recommended antibiotics. Furthermore, the effect of probiotics (Lacidofil) on the efficacy of first-line treatment with amoxicillin and clarithromycin was analyzed. The study population consisted of 641 patients: 192 received amoxicillin with clarithromycin and proton pump inhibitor (PPI), 241 - tetracycline, tinidazole, bismuth and PPI, 53 - amoxicillin with clarithromycin and PPI supplemented with Lacidofil. The efficacy of eradication treatment was evaluated by the (13)C-urease breath test. The microbiological examination included 111 samples of H. pylori. The present study demonstrated low efficacy of the tetracycline, tinidazole, bismuth and PPI scheme i.e. 71.4%, moderate efficacy of the amoxicillin with clarithromycin and PPI scheme i.e. 85.9%, whereas the supplementation with Lacidofil significantly increased the efficacy of eradication to 94.3%. The microbiological examination revealed a relatively high level of primary resistance to clarithromycin (22.2%) and a high level to metronidazole (46.7%), with no resistance to amoxicillin. However, the most important finding is the high level of secondary resistance to clarithromycin and metronidazole (more than 66% in both cases). The present findings suggest the need for modification of the recommended eradication schemes.
TI  - Upregulation of oxidative burst and degranulation in chicken heterophils stimulated with probiotic bacteria.
AB  - The immune system of neonatal chicks is functionally immature during the first week of life. Researchers have previously demonstrated that the avian humoral response can be increased with probiotics. Although the humoral response provides the chick with an effective mechanism to combat pathogens, sufficient antibody titers are not attained until 7 to 10 d postinfection. However, the innate immune system (i.e., heterophils) can respond much more quickly to pathogens. The objective of this study was to determine whether probiotic bacteria can also upregulate heterophil function. Heterophils were isolated from the peripheral blood of neonatal chickens by using a discontinuous density gradient. Oxidative burst and degranulation are bactericidal mechanisms used by heterophils to kill pathogens and were used in this study as indicators of heterophil function. We found that each of the 10 "generally recognized as safe" probiotic isolates (designated G1 to G11) tested in vitro were capable of increasing (P < 0.05) heterophil oxidative burst and degranulation when compared with unstimulated controls. Bacillus subtilis (G3), Lactococcus lactis lactis (G6), and Lactobacillus acidophilus (G8) isolates were determined to elicit the greatest heterophil response in vitro and were subsequently fed to chicks. Phosphate-buffered saline or 1 of these 3 probiotic isolates (approximately 2.5 x 10(8) cfu/chick; 50 chicks/treatment) resuspended in PBS was administered by oral gavage on the day of hatch. Heterophils were isolated from chicks from each of these 4 treatment groups 24 h posttreatment. Significant increases in heterophil degranulation and oxidative burst were observed with the G3-, G6-, and G8-treated chicks when compared with heterophils isolated from birds with no probiotic treatment. These data suggest that probiotic bacteria can significantly improve heterophil oxidative burst and degranulation in broilers. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating a relationship between probiotics and avian heterophil function.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus lysates on the cytotoxic activity of shiga-like toxin 2 produced from Escherichia coli O157:H7.
AB  - AIMS: The purpose of this study was to characterize the degree to which four cell lysates obtained from Lactobacillus acidophilus strains affected the cytotoxic activity of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in vitro and in vivo. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a cytotoxic inhibition test that used 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and toxin-binding ELISA assays, the activity of shiga-like toxin 2 (Stx-2) was inhibited profoundly by the cell lysates (10 mg ml(-1)) from two strains of L. acidophilus A4 and 30SC (>85% of survival rates compared with the control) among the five strains tested. In particular, a significant decline in the virulence level of E. coli O157:H7, under the presence of the cell lysates of L. acidophilus A4, was observed by killing assay of Caenorhabditis elegans in vivo model. CONCLUSIONS: According to our results, L. acidophilus strains might be capable of attenuating the virulence of Stx-2 produced from E. coli O157:H7. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The cell lysates of L. acidophilus can be applied to a variety of foods, and can be used as adjuncts for the inhibition of Stx-2-mediated cytotoxicity.
TI  - Absence of efficacy of nonviable Lactobacillus acidophilus for the prevention of  traveler's diarrhea: a randomized, double-blind, controlled study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diarrhea is the most common illness associated with international tourism. We evaluated the efficacy of a probiotic preparation of nonviable Lactobacillus acidophilus (hereafter referred to as LA) for the prevention of traveler's diarrhea. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial. Travelers were randomized to receive either LA or placebo twice daily from 1 day before their departure to 3 days after their return. On each day of the trip and the week following the return, travelers had to record the number and consistency of stools and their adherence to the treatment. Diarrhea was defined as > or =3 unformed stools in a 24-h period. RESULTS: From January 2001 to September 2004, a total of 174 subjects were randomized to each treatment group. Half of the travelers went to West Africa, and organized tours or backpacking were the most common modes of traveling. The incidence of diarrhea did not differ between the 2 groups; it was 61.4 cases per 100 person-months in the LA group (95% confidence interval [CI], 44.1-85.5) and 43.4 cases per 100 person-months in the placebo group (95% CI, 30.0-62.9) (P=.14). Adjustment for travel duration and other variables did not reveal any difference between the 2 groups (adjusted hazard ratios comparing the LA and placebo groups were 1.43 [95% CI, 0.87-2.36] in an intent-to-treat analysis and 1.38 [95% CI, 0.79-2.39] in an efficacy analysis). CONCLUSIONS: There was no beneficial effect of treatment with LA for the prevention of travelers' diarrhea. More studies are required to assess the efficacy of other specific probiotics (e.g., a Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG preparation) for preventing traveler's diarrhea.
TI  - Immune responses generated by Lactobacillus as a carrier in DNA immunization against foot-and-mouth disease virus.
AB  - To exploit Lactobacillus acidophilus as a carrier in DNA immunization against foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), a recombinant eukaryotic expression plasmid (pRc/CMV2-VP1-Rep. 8014) harboring pRc/CMV2 vector, the FMDV VP1 gene, and a replication origin from Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC 8014 strain was constructed. To detect the VP1 protein, pRc/CMV2-VP1-Rep. 8014 was expressed in PK 15 cells and transfected into a L. acidophilus SW1 strain (L. acidophilus SFMD-1). To evaluate the immunization effect of L. acidophilus SFMD-1, anti-FMDV VP1 antibody, T-cell proliferation, antigen-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), and tissue distribution were investigated using intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intranasal, and oral administration delivery routes. The results showed that L. acidophilus SFMD-1 was able to elicit a detectable antibody level on day 21. The VP1 antibody levels induced by L. acidophilus SFMD-1 and commercial inactivated FMDV vaccine rose rapidly to 0.84 and 0.70, respectively, by day 42, then sustained a high level by day 49. The route of administration had an impact on the magnitude of the systemic antigen-specific IgG responses, with intramuscularly applied L. acidophilus SFMD-1 generating the greatest FMDV VP1 antibody response, followed by intraperitoneal, intranasal, and oral administration delivery routes. Using the T-cell proliferation assay, the stimulation index of a group immunized with L. acidophilus SFMD-1 reached 2.78 versus 5.08 in a group immunized with pRc/CMV2-VP1-Rep. 8014 plasmid. Mice immunized with L. acidophilus SFMD-1 were able to induce T-cell-mediated antigen-specific DTH. In addition, the VP1 gene was detected in the muscle, kidney, spleen, and heart, but not in the liver. The results demonstrate clearly that Lactobacillus as a carrier is a promising approach of DNA vaccination, and is a potentially guard against FMDV.
TI  - [The electron microscopic study of cell-to-cell interactions between antagonistic microorganisms].
AB  - The electron microscopic study of thin sections and positively stained specimens  of cells taken from particular cocultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus D75, Lactobacillus casei YIT 9018, Shigella flexnery 2a, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 (some of these bacteria are antagonistic to others) showed the presence of specific ultrastructural elements indicating cell specialization and cooperation. The responses of antagonistic bacteria manifested themselves at the cellular and population levels.
TI  - Effect of ginseng polysaccharide on the stability of lactic acid bacteria during  freeze-drying process and storage.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) quickly attenuate or are killed during the freeze-drying process and storage. The effect of some natural polysaccharides, which are known as potent antitumor and immunomodulating substances, on the viability of the LAB, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium breve, on freeze-drying and storage were investigated. Among the polysaccharides tested, red ginseng polysaccharide (RGP) and chitosan significantly inhibited the cell death of the LAB during freeze-drying, and fucoidan and RGP most potently protected the cell death of the LAB during storage. The stabilities of the LAB on the addition of RGP and fucoidan were comparable to that of skimmed milk. However, white ginseng polysaccharide (WGP) did not promote storage stability. When 5% skimmed milk/5% RGP treated LAB were freeze-dried and stored, their viabilities were found to be significantly higher those treated with 5% or 10% RGP. The stabilizing effect of 5% RGP/5% skimmed milk during LAB freeze-drying and storage stability was comparable to that of treatment with 10% skimmed milk. Based on these findings, we believe that RGP beneficially improves the stability of LAB during the freeze-dry process and storage.
TI  - Alteration of the canine small-intestinal lactic acid bacterium microbiota by feeding of potential probiotics.
AB  - Five potentially probiotic canine fecal lactic acid bacterium (LAB) strains, Lactobacillus fermentum LAB8, Lactobacillus salivarius LAB9, Weissella confusa LAB10, Lactobacillus rhamnosus LAB11, and Lactobacillus mucosae LAB12, were fed to five permanently fistulated beagles for 7 days. The survival of the strains and their potential effects on the indigenous intestinal LAB microbiota were monitored for 17 days. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) demonstrated that the five fed LAB strains survived in the upper gastrointestinal tract and modified the dominant preexisting indigenous jejunal LAB microbiota of the dogs. When the LAB supplementation was ceased, DGGE analysis of jejunal chyme showed that all the fed LAB strains were undetectable after 7 days. However, the diversity of the intestinal indigenous microbiota of the dogs, as characterized from jejunal chyme plated on Lactobacillus selective medium without acetic acid, was reduced and did not return to the original level during the study period. In all but one dog, an indigenous Lactobacillus acidophilus strain emerged as the dominant LAB strain. In conclusion, strains LAB8 to LAB12 have potential as probiotic strains for dogs as they survive in and dominate the jejunal LAB microbiota during feeding and have the ability to modify the intestinal microbiota.
TI  - Effects of probiotic supplementation for the first 6 months of life on allergen-  and vaccine-specific immune responses.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A reduction in microbial burden during infancy when allergen-specific memory is evolving has become a prominent explanation for the allergy epidemic. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether probiotic dietary supplementation in the first 6 months of life could modify allergen- and vaccine-specific immune responses. METHODS: Two hundred and thirty-one pregnant women with a history of allergic disease and positive allergen skin prick test (SPT) were recruited into a randomized-controlled trial. The infants received either a probiotic (3 x 10(9)Lactobacillus acidophilus LAVRI-A1; Probiomics) or placebo (maltodextrin alone) daily for the first 6 months of life, given independent of feeding methods. One hundred and seventy-eight children completed the study; blood samples were available from 60 children in the placebo group and 58 children in the probiotic group. Infant cytokine (IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, TNF-alpha or TGF-beta) responses to tetanus toxoid (TT), house dust mite (HDM), ovalbumin (OVA), beta-lactoglobulin (BLG), Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB) and phytohaemaglutinin (PHA) were measured at 6 months of age. RESULTS: Children who received the probiotics showed reduced production of IL-5 and TGF-beta in response to polyclonal (SEB) stimulation (P=0.044 and 0.015, respectively). They also demonstrated significantly lower IL-10 responses to TT vaccine antigen compared with the placebo group (P=0.03), and this was not due to any differences in vaccination. However, there were no significant effects of probiotics on either Type 1 (Th1) or Type 2 (Th2) T helper cell responses to allergens or other stimuli. The only other effects observed were for reduced TNF-alpha and IL-10 responsiveness to HDM allergens in children receiving probiotics (P=0.046 and 0.014, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In summary, although we did not see any consistent effects on allergen-specific responses, our study suggests that probiotics may have immunomodulatory effects on vaccine responses. The significance and clinical relevance of this need to be determined in further studies.
TI  - Evaluation of the effects of probiotic supplementation from the neonatal period on innate immune development in infancy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Activation of the innate immune system by microbial stimulation is believed to be critical for normal immune maturation, and there has been speculation that these pathways are important for inhibiting allergic-immune responses. OBJECTIVE: To assess innate immune function following a 6-month supplementation with probiotic bacteria. METHODS: Two hundred and thirty-one allergic, pregnant women were recruited into a randomized, controlled trial. The infants received either a probiotic (Lactobacillus acidophilus LAVRI-A1; Probiomics) or placebo (maltodextrin alone) daily for the first 6 months of life. Mononuclear cell samples were available from 118 infants. Functional responses to toll-like receptor (TLR) were assessed using ligands for TLR2 (Pansorbin) and TLR4/CD14 [lipopolysaccharide (LPS)] and measuring cytokine responses in the supernatants. Antigen-presenting cell function, as well as capacity for cytokine production (IL-12p70 and IL-10) was assessed. RESULTS: Infants in the probiotic group did not demonstrate differences in innate immune function compared with those in the control group. No differences were seen when cytokine responses were examined following stimulation with Pansorbin (TLR2) or LPS (TLR4). Similarly, no differences were seen in the antigen-presenting capacity of these infants. The mean fluorescence intensities of human leucocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR) on monocytes, B cells and dendritic cells (DC) subsets were not affected, nor were the percentage of circulating DC subsets affected by a 6-month supplementation with L. acidophilus LAVRI-A1. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotic supplementation with L. acidophilus for the first 6 months of life did not alter early innate immune responses in this population at high risk of developing allergic disease.
TI  - The in vitro effect of hydrogen peroxide on vaginal microbial communities.
AB  - This study presents a series of experiments carried out in order to elucidate the role of H2O2 in antimicrobial activity of lactobacilli. Vaginal swabs were collected from 60 premenopausal women and checked for pH and Nugent score, and Lactobacillus species were cultured, phenotyped and genotyped. The main outcome measures involved: (1) species of vaginal lactobacilli most effective in liberating H2O2, (2) minimal microbicidal concentrations of added H2O2, (3) kinetics of H2O2 liberation in relation to oxygen tension, (4) antimicrobial activity of pure H2O2 versus one produced by selected vaginal lactobacilli and the total activity of their culture supernatants. Results showed that H2O2 was liberated especially by: Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus johnsonii and L. gasseri. Hydrogen peroxide reached concentrations from 0.05 to 1.0 mM, which under intensive aeration increased even up to 1.8 mM. Microorganisms related to vaginal pathologies show varied resistance to the action of pure H2O2. Most potent inhibitory activity against bacteria and yeasts was presented by Lactobacillus culture supernate producing H2O2, followed by the nonproducing strain and pure H2O2. To conclude - the antimicrobial activity of lactobacilli is a summation of various inhibitory mechanisms in which H2O2 plays some but not a crucial role, in addition to other substances.
TI  - Selecting lactic acid bacteria for their safety and functionality by use of a mouse colitis model.
AB  - Studies showed that specific probiotics might provide therapeutic benefits in inflammatory bowel disease. However, a rigorous screening of new probiotics is needed to study possible adverse interactions with the host, particularly when intended for administration to individuals with certain health risks. In this context, the objective of this study was to investigate the role of three lactobacilli (LAB) on intestinal inflammation and bacterial translocation using variations of the mouse model of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced acute colitis. We first compared the in vitro ability of LAB to survive gastrointestinal tract (GIT) conditions and their ability to persist in the GIT of mice following daily oral administration. As a control, we included a nonprobiotic Lactobacillus paracasei strain, previously isolated from an endocarditis patient. Feeding high doses of LAB strains to healthy and to TNBS-treated mice did not induce any detrimental effect or abnormal translocation of the bacteria. Oral administration of Lactobacillus salivarius Ls-33 had a significant preventive effect on colitis in mice, while Lactobacillus plantarum Lp-115 and Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM did not. None of the three selected LAB strains translocated to extraintestinal organs of TNBS-treated mice. In contrast, L. paracasei exacerbated colitis under severe inflammatory conditions and translocated to extraintestinal organs. This study showed that evaluations of the safety and functionality of new probiotics are recommended. We conclude that not all lactobacilli have similar effects on intestinal inflammation and that selected probiotics such as L. salivarius Ls-33 may be considered in the prevention or treatment of intestinal inflammation.
TI  - Sugars relevant for sourdough fermentation stimulate growth of and bacteriocin production by Lactobacillus amylovorus DCE 471.
AB  - The effects of sugars relevant for sourdough fermentation (i.e. glucose, fructose, maltose, and sucrose) on the kinetics of the bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus amylovorus DCE 471 strain were assessed. The sugars were applied solely or in combination in a sourdough simulation medium during batch fermentations at temperature and pH conditions encountered during the production of type II sourdoughs. When growing on a single energy source, glucose was preferentially consumed by L. amylovorus DCE 471, followed by maltose and fructose. The strain was unable to grow on sucrose. In glucose-containing mixtures, glucose was always consumed most rapidly by L. amylovorus DCE 471 and seemed to steer its growth during the early growth phase, mainly because of the delaying effect on maltose consumption. Maltose consumption started only when low glucose levels were reached. In all cases, fructose was used as an energy source and not as a terminal electron acceptor, since no acetic acid or mannitol were produced. Increased bacteriocin titres were observed with binary or ternary sugar combinations compared to single energy sources. Thus, the diversity of the energy source seemed to stimulate the production of amylovorin L. Cell growth of and production of amylovorin L by L. amylovorus DCE 471 paralleled for all sugar combinations tested.
TI  - Physicochemical characteristics of commercial lactases relevant to their application in the alleviation of lactose intolerance.
AB  - Selected microbial lactases are used to treat lactose intolerance. A series of experiments were carried out in vitro in order to determine the likely relative suitability of four major commercial lactase products used in this regard. The lactases displayed between 55 and 61% of maximum activity at 37 degrees C and significant activity between pH 3.0 and 6.5. They retained between 0 and 65% of original activities after exposure to full simulated digestive tract conditions for 6 h. All four enzymes proved to be particularly acid sensitive and only two products were enteric coated. The products demonstrated varying ability to hydrolyze lactose under simulated digestive tract conditions. The most effective product hydrolyzed 2.7 g lactose per capsule, suggesting that consumption of several capsules, as opposed to the usually recommended one or two, would be required to hydrolyze the entire 12 g lactose load characteristic of a dairy-based meal. All enzymes were substantially pure and displayed similar kinetic properties and molecular weights. None appeared ideally suited for use in the alleviation of lactose intolerance. The findings may in part explain the variability and often disappointing results previously reported for lactase-based clinical trials and will provide comparative baseline data against which candidate second-generation lactases may be assessed.
TI  - Transformation of isoflavone phytoestrogens during the fermentation of soymilk with lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  - In the present study, soymilk is fermented with lactic acid bacteria (Streptococcus thermophilus BCRC 14085, Lactobacillus acidophilus BCRC 14079) and bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium infantis BCRC 14633, B. longum B6) individually, and in combination. The change in the content of various isoflavones (aglycones, glucoside, acetyl- and malonyl-glucosides) and the beta-glucosidase activity in soymilk during fermentation is investigated. It is observed that fermented soymilk contains a lower total isoflavone content (81.94-86.61 microg/ml) than soymilk without fermentation (87.61 microg/ml). Regardless of starter organism employed, fermentation causes a major reduction in the contents of glucoside, malonylglucoside and acetylglucoside isoflavones along with a significant increase of aglycone isoflavones content. The level of change in the content of various isoflavones and beta-glucosidase activity after fermentation varies with the starter organism. Among all the fermented soymilks tested, soymilk fermented with S. thermophilus showed the highest beta-glucosidase activity and the greatest increase in the contents of aglycones. The percentage of daidzein, genistein and glycitein to total isoflavone content in S. thermophilus-fermented soymilk increases from an initial 14.24%, 6.89% and 2.45%, respectively, to 36.20%, 28.80% and 12.44% after 24h of fermentation. Finally, the increase of aglycones and decrease of glucoside isoflavones during fermentation coincides with the increase of beta-glucosidase activity observed in fermented soymilk.
TI  - Antioxidative activities of soymilk fermented with lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  - To further the goal of developing a probiotic dietary adjunct using soymilk, soymilk is fermented with lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus CCRC 14079 or Streptococcus thermophilus CCRC 14085) and bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium infantis CCRC 14633 or Bifidobacterium longum B6) individually, and in conjunction. We investigate several antioxidative activities including the inhibition of ascorbate autoxidation, the scavenging effect of superoxide anion radicals and hydrogen peroxide, and the reducing activity exerted by different varieties of fermented soymilks. In addition, the effect of spray-drying and freeze-drying on changes in antioxidative activity is examined. We find that in fermented soymilk both the inhibition of ascorbate autoxidation, and the reducing activity and scavenging effect of superoxide anion radicals varied with the starters used, but nevertheless are significantly higher than those found in unfermented soymilk. In general, antioxidative activity in soymilk fermented with lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria simultaneously is significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that fermented with either individually. Moreover, antioxidative activity increases as the fermentation period is extended. However, unfermented soymilk shows an H2O2-scavenging effect, while there is no scavenging effect except for the accumulation of H2O2 in fermented soymilk. Finally, we find that freeze-drying causes a significantly lesser (P < 0.05) reduction in the antioxidative activity of soymilk than does spray-drying. Irrespective of the drying method and the starters used for fermentation. The antioxidative activity of fermented soymilk reduces after drying yet remains higher than that of dried unfermented soymilk.
TI  - [Ultrastructural changes in Shigella flexneri cells during interaction with bacteriocinogenic Lactobacillus acidophilus].
AB  - Results of electron-microscopic examination of Shigella flexneri cells, subjected to influence the bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus acidophilus bacteria are presented. The response of shigellae to bacteriocinogenic lactobacilli was shown both on cellular and population levels. On population level the correlation of various morphological types of shigella cells with increase of involution, lysing and resting forms is revealed. At a cellular level the specific ultrastructural changes of shigella evidencing the significant destructive processes of the cells were revealed. In one case destabilization of shigella cellular wall was observed, that was manifested in expansion of periplasmic spaces and appearence of specific involution forms of the cells. In other cases, changes in the ultrastructural organization of shigella nucleoid were found out, manifested in disappearance of thin-fibrillar DNA and formation of electronic-dense globular structures of the cells.
TI  - Isolation of a Lactobacillus salivarius strain and purification of its bacteriocin, which is inhibitory to Campylobacter jejuni in the chicken gastrointestinal system.
AB  - We evaluated anti-Campylobacter jejuni activity among >1,200 isolates of different lactic acid bacteria. Lactobacillus salivarius strain NRRL B-30514 was selected for further study. The cell-free, ammonium sulfate precipitate from the broth culture was termed the crude antimicrobial preparation. Ten microliters of the crude preparation created a zone of C. jejuni growth inhibition, and growth within the zone resumed when the crude preparation was preincubated with proteolytic enzymes. Bacteriocin OR-7, derived from this crude preparation, was further purified using ion-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatography. The determined amino acid sequence was consistent with class IIa bacteriocins. Interestingly, OR-7 had sequence similarity, even in the C-terminal region, to acidocin A, which was previously identified from L. acidophilus and had activity only to gram-positive bacteria, whereas OR-7 had activity to a gram-negative bacterium. Bacteriocin activity was stable following exposure to 90 degrees C for 15 min, also consistent with these types of antibacterial peptides. The purified protein was encapsulated in polyvinylpyrrolidone and added to chicken feed. Ten day-of-hatch chicks were placed in each of nine isolation units; two groups of birds were challenged with each of four C. jejuni isolates (one isolate per unit). At 7 days of age, one group of birds was treated with bacteriocin-emended feed for 3 days, and one group was left untreated. At 10 days of age, the birds were sacrificed and the challenge strain was enumerated from the bird cecal content. Bacteriocin treatment consistently reduced colonization at least one millionfold compared with levels found in the untreated groups. Nonchallenged birds were never colonized by C. jejuni. Bacteriocin from L. salivarius NRRL B-30514 appears potentially very useful to reduce C. jejuni in poultry prior to processing.
TI  - VSL#3 probiotic mixture: a review of its use in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  - VSL#3 (VSL#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium longum, B. breve and B. infantis) and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. Data from noncomparative trials suggest that VSL#3 has clinical potential in the treatment of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. In addition, a randomised, open-label, multicentre trial showed that VSL#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown VSL#3 is effective in preventing the onset of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. Treatment guidelines from the US and the UK include VSL#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. In general, VSL#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. Large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of VSL#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.
TI  - Mutagenicity and antimutagenic effect of soymilk fermented with lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  - In this study, soymilk was first fermented with lactic acid bacteria (Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus) and bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium longum) both individually and simultaneously. Mutagenicity and the suppression of fermented soymilk against the mutagenesis induced by 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4-NQO), a direct-acting mutagen, and 3,2'-dimethyl-4-amino-biphenyl (DMAB), an indirect-acting mutagen, on Salmonella typhimurium TA 100, was then investigated. It was found that the fermented soymilk shows no mutagenic activity on Sal. typhimurium TA 100. Fermentation, in general, significantly (p<0.05) enhanced the antimutagenicity of soymilk. The levels of increased antimutagenicity of fermented soymilk varied with the starter organism and the type of mutagen tested. Although unfermented soymilk exerted lower antimutagenic activity against DMAB than 4-NQO, the fermented soymilk, generally, showed a higher antimutagenic activity against DMAB than 4-NQO. Among the various fermented soymilk tested, soymilk fermented with both Str. themophilus and B. infantis simultaneously exhibited the highest antimutagenicity of 85.07% and 85.78%, respectively, against 4-NQO and DMAB Further investigation on this fermented soymilk revealed that both the antimutagenic factors formed during fermentation and the cells of the starter organisms contributed to the increased antimutagenic activity against DMAB, while the former led to the increased activity against 4-NQO.
TI  - Rapid discrimination of lactobacilli isolated from kefir grains by FT-IR spectroscopy.
AB  - Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was used in combination with multivariate statistical analysis for differentiation of lactic bacteria isolated from kefir grains. Twelve reference strains and 42 lactobacilli isolates from four local kefir grains, previously identified by biochemical traditional techniques at species level were included in this study. The spectra were analysed by hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) using Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient and Ward's algorithm. The differentiation between homo- and heterofermentative lactobacilli, proposed as a first level in the classification scheme, was performed with vector normalized first derivatives spectra in the windows 1789-1700, 1059-935, 3000-2927 and 896-833 cm(-1). For heterofermentative lactobacilli the windows 1780-1750, 1500-1200, 2950-2930 and 900-700 cm(-1) were found to contribute to the maximal separation among L. kefir, L. parakefir and Lactobacillus brevis. It was also demonstrated that although this model was robust against small variations in growth temperature (+/-5 degrees C) and growth time (+/-5 h), the make of culture medium used (Biokar or Difco) affected the separation of heterofermentative lactobacilli at species level. For homofermentative lactobacilli the spectral regions 1230-900, 1777-1690, 1357-1240 and 2960-2870 cm(-1), were selected for discrimination among 5 different species that are normally present in kefir grains: L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. kefirgranum, L. kefiranofaciens and L. cassei. The classification and discrimination schemes proposed in this work completely matched with the identification obtained by classical biochemical techniques at species level.
TI  - Photocatalytic antibacterial effect of TiO(2) film formed on Ti and TiAg exposed  to Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - When irradiated under near-ultraviolet (UV) light, TiO(2) exhibits strong bactericidal activity. The TiO(2) photocatalyst would be effective on orthodontic appliances after its antibacterial effect on the carcinogenic microorganism Lactobacillus acidophilus is evaluated. To compare the antibacterial effect of two crystalline forms of TiO(2), rutile and anatase, thermal oxidation and anodic oxidation were employed to form each structure, respectively. The antibacterial effect of TiO(2) film on TiAg was also compared with that on Ti. Bacterial solutions were pipetted onto the TiO(2)-coated specimen and illuminated with UVA (2 x 15 W, black light, 356 nm) up to 100 min and the reaction solutions were incubated to count the colony-forming units. The antibacterial activity of the coated specimens was similar to that of the uncoated group. The antibacterial activity of the coated specimens of TiAg was not different from that of Ti. TiO(2) coatings formed on both Ti and TiAg specimens did not exhibit cytotoxicity on the L-929 cells of mice.
TI  - Culture-independent analysis of the microbial composition of the African traditional fermented foods poto poto and degue by using three different DNA extraction methods.
AB  - The microbial composition of the traditional fermented foods poto poto (a maize dough from the Rep. of Congo) and degue (a millet dough from Burkina Faso) was studied by a culture-independent approach using TTGE to separate the amplified target V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene from total microbial community, followed by DNA sequencing and homology search. Three different extraction methods were used. Guanidium thiocyanate-based DNA extraction provided better performance regarding purity and DNA yield, allowing the detection of a higher number of DNA bands by TTGE in poto poto. By contrast, all three methods yielded similar results for degue samples, indicating that the performance of the DNA extraction method largely depends on the food composition. Sequencing of DNA bands from TTGE gels corresponding to poto poto samples revealed the presence of Lactobacillus gasseri, Enterococcus sp., Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus plantarum/paraplantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Bacillus sp., Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus casei. The following bacteria were identified in degue: L. gasseri, Enterococcus sp., E. coli, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus brevis, and L. casei.
TI  - Importance of the host specificity in the selection of probiotic bacteria.
AB  - The gastrointestinal tract is a complex and dynamic ecosystem. Commensal microorganisms (C), which proliferate in the intestine from birth, are crucial for gut homeostasis while non commensal (NC) microorganisms are transient and enter the organism from the environment and foods. We studied comparatively the influence of oral administration of C and NC Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacilus acidophilus on the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) of conventional mice. To determine the importance of the selection of probiotic host-specificity bacteria with immunomodulating capacity, we examined the interaction with the gut by transmission electron microscopy and FITC-labelled bacteria. We compared the immunomodulation capacities of C and NC strains by studying the number of IgA secreting cells and cytokine profile. No differences were found in the number of IgA+ cells; however, the pattern of cytokine response to C and NC bacteria was different. With regard to proinflammatory cytokine (IFNgamma and TNFalpha), we found that TNFalpha was mainly produced by NC bacteria, while C bacteria were able to elicit mainly IFNgamma. The regulatory cytokines (IL-10 and IL-4) were induced with different patterns for both C and NC strains. No differences in the pathway of internalization to the gut between C and NC were found. In summary, we determined that C and NC bacteria interact with the intestine in the same way; both C and NC bacteria were able to reinforce the surveillance of the gut mucosal immune system. The cytokine profile showed that C bacteria would be involved in the regulation of intestinal homeostasis rather than in the immune activation as the NC bacteria.
TI  - Intrinsic properties of so-called dormant probiotic bacteria, determined by flow  cytometric viability assays.
AB  - Plate counting and four culture-independent flow cytometric assays were used to determine the viability and intrinsic properties of three probiotic strains during storage. The strains showed reduction in plate counts but were able to maintain esterase activity, intact cytoplasmic membrane, and pH gradient. The apparently uncultivable probiotic cells were active and stress resistant.
TI  - Comparison of the concentrations of phenolic compounds in olive oils and other plant oils: correlation with antimicrobial activity.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of different edible vegetable oils was studied. In vitro results revealed that the oils from olive fruits had a strong bactericidal action against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, this effect being higher in general against Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria. Thus, olive oils showed bactericidal activity not only against harmful bacteria of the intestinal microbiota (Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli) also against beneficial microorganisms such as Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum. Otherwise, most of the foodborne pathogens tested (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica, Yersinia sp., and Shigella sonnei) did not survive after 1 h of contact with olive oils. The dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl oleuropein and ligstroside aglycons, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, were the phenolic compounds that statistically correlated with bacterial survival. These findings were confirmed by testing each individual phenolic compound, isolated by HPLC, against L. monocytogenes. In particular, the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl ligstroside aglycon showed a potent antimicrobial activity. These results indicate that not all oils classified as "olive oil" had similar bactericidal effects and that this bioactivity depended on their content of certain phenolic compounds.
TI  - Post-natal development of the porcine microbiota composition and activities.
AB  - The current study describes the development of the porcine microbiota and its metabolic activities during the neonatal and weaning period. Using 16S rRNA-based approaches, we first analysed the ileal and colonic microbiota of neonatal piglets at days 2, 5 and 12 after birth. To further investigate the effect of weaning at 3 weeks of age, 19-day-old piglets (n = 64) were randomly allocated into two groups. Half of the piglets remained with their sows throughout the study, while the remaining piglets were weaned. As revealed by sequence analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicons, the samples of 2-day-old piglets harboured a consortium of bacteria related to Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Lactobacillus sobrius, Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Moreover, species-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction assays unveiled that L. sobrius and L. reuteri predominated in the ileal samples of the neonatal and unweaned piglets with population levels up to 7 x 10(8) cells per gram of lumen content. Following weaning, however, these two lactobacilli were detected at significantly lower levels (< 10(3)) in the ileal samples. Furthermore, a shift in composition and metabolic activities of the predominant microbiota, and emergence of clostridia and E. coli, were encountered in the intestinal samples of the piglets after the early post-weaning period.
TI  - Inhibition of allergen-induced airway inflammation and hyperreactivity by recombinant lactic-acid bacteria.
AB  - Recombinant lactic-acid bacteria (LAB) are able to inhibit allergen-specific T-cell responses. In this study, we examined whether oral feeding of recombinant LAB was able to suppress allergen-induced airway inflammation and hyperreactivity (AHR) in a murine model. Animals were intraperitoneally sensitized with Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus group-5 allergen (Der p 5) and orally treated with recombinant LAB containing a plasmid-encoded Der p 5 gene or placebo on day 7 and day 14 for three days consecutively. Twenty-one days after sensitization, mice underwent inhalational challenging. Der p 5-specific immunological responses including changes to specific immunoglobulin G and E (IgE) levels, the presence of cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and AHR were assessed following this inhalational challenge. We demonstrated that oral feeding of recombinant LAB could significantly decrease the synthesis of Der p 5-specific IgE, and AHR. Furthermore, following such treatment, we also noted that both neutrophils and eosinophils had infiltrated the BALF to a significantly lower extent, when compared to the vehicle-treated group. Neither recombinant allergen nor LAB alone was able to suppress allergen-induced immune responses. Our findings suggest that treatment with recombinant LAB at a low dose can suppress allergen-induced airway allergic inflammation, this providing a basis for developing a novel therapeutic method for allergic airway diseases.
TI  - Characterisation of prototype Nurmi cultures using culture-based microbiological  techniques and PCR-DGGE.
AB  - Undefined Nurmi-type cultures (NTCs) have been used successfully to prevent salmonella colonisation in poultry for decades. Such cultures are derived from the caecal contents of specific-pathogen-free birds and are administered via drinking water or spray application onto eggs in the hatchery. These cultures consist of many non-culturable and obligately anaerobic bacteria. Due to their undefined nature it is difficult to obtain approval from regulatory agencies to use these preparations as direct fed microbials for poultry. In this study, 10 batches of prototype NTCs were produced using an identical protocol over a period of 2 years. Traditional microbiological techniques and a molecular culture-independent methodology, polymerase chain reaction combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), were applied to characterise these cultures and also to examine if the constituents of the NTCs were identical. Culture-dependent analysis of these cultures included plating on a variety of selective and semi-selective agars, examination of colony morphology, Gram-staining and a series of biochemical tests (API, BioMerieux, France). Two sets of PCR-DGGE studies were performed. These involved the amplification of universal and subsequently lactic acid bacteria (LAB)-specific hypervariable regions of a 16S rRNA gene by PCR. Resultant amplicons were subjected to DGGE. Sequence analysis was performed on subsequent bands present in resultant DGGE profiles using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). Microbiological culturing techniques tended to isolate common probiotic bacterial species from the genera Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, Clostridium, Escherichia, Pediococcus and Enterobacterium as well as members of the genera, Actinomyces, Bacteroides, Propionibacterium, Capnocytophaga, Proteus, and Klebsiella. Bacteroides, Enterococcus, Escherichia, Brevibacterium, Klebsiella, Lactobacillus, Clostridium, Bacillus, Eubacterium, Serratia, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Pectobacterium and Pantoea spp. in addition to unculturable bacteria were identified as constituents of the NTCs using universal PCR-DGGE analysis. A number of the sequences detected by LAB-specific PCR-DGGE were homologous to those of a number of Lactobacillus spp., including L. fermentum, L. pontis, L. crispatus, L. salivarius, L. casei, L. suntoryeus, L. vaginalis, L. gasseri, L. aviaries, L. johnsonii, L. acidophilus, and L. mucosae in addition to a range of unculturable lactobacilli. While NTCs are successful due to their complexity, the presence of members of Lactobacillus spp. amongst other probiotic genera, in these samples possibly lends to the success of the NTC cultures as probiotics or competitive exclusion products in poultry over the decades. PCR-DGGE proved to be an effective tool in detecting non-culturable organisms present in these complex undefined cultures. In conclusion, while the culture-dependent identification methods or PCR-DGGE alone cannot comprehensively elucidate the bacterial species present in such complex cultures, their complementarity provides useful information on the identity of the constituents of NTCs and will aid in future development of defined probiotics. Moreover, for the purpose of analysing prototype NTCs during their development, PCR-DGGE overcomes the limitations associated with conventional culturing methods including their low sensitivities, inability to detect unculturable bacteria and unknown species, very slow turnabout time and poor reproducibility. This study demonstrated that PCR-DGGE is indeed more valuable in detecting predominant microbial populations between various NTCs than as an identification methodology, being more applicable as a quality control method used to analyse for batch-to-batch variation during NTC production.
TI  - The effectiveness of alumina powder on carious dentin removal.
AB  - This study determined the size of aluminum oxide particles used in an air abrasion system that is able to remove carious dentin tissue with maximum preservation of sound structure. Thirty extracted and carious-free third molars were used in this study. The dentin sample was obtained by sectioning the middle of the crown longitudinal to the long axis of the tooth in a mesio-distal direction. One half of the crown corresponded to the sound dentin group (SD), while the other half was used to develop artificial caries, constituting the carious dentin group (CD). The specimens were air abraded for 15 seconds. The SD and CD groups were each randomly divided into three subgroups (N=10) according to the particle diameter employed (27, 50 and 125 microm). The prepared cavity was perpendicularly cut in half, and the profiles of all hemi-fragments were observed using SEM microscopy. The cavity measurements were made using a modified cephalometric analysis. The 27, 50 and 125 microm aluminum oxide particles did not present selectivity in the removal of carious dentin. However, when using the air abrasive technique for carious dentin treatment, the use of 27 and 50 microm aluminum oxide particles is recommended, due to their capacity to remove less sound tissue than the 125 microm particles.
TI  - Probiotics for prevention of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis: a review.
AB  - Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is a common infection affecting the quality of life of many women. Probiotics have been investigated as possible agents for the prevention of recurrences of VVC. We reviewed the available literature. In some studies the development of VVC was associated with either a low number of lactobacilli in the vagina or with the presence of H2O2-non-producing vaginal lactobacilli, although there are a few studies not supporting these statements. In addition, in vitro studies have shown that lactobacilli can inhibit the growth of Candida albicans and/or its adherence on the vaginal epithelium. The results of some clinical trials support the effectiveness of lactobacilli, especially Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus fermentum RC-14, administered either orally or intravaginally in colonizing the vagina and/or preventing the colonization and infection of the vagina by C. albicans, while the results of a small number of clinical trials do not corroborate these findings. Nevertheless, most of the relevant clinical trials had methodological problems such as small sample size, no control group (placebo) and included women without confirmed recurrent VVC, and thus they are not reliable for drawing definitive conclusions. Thus, the available evidence for the use of probiotics for prevention of recurrent VVC is limited. However, the empirical use of probiotics may be considered in women with frequent recurrence of VVC (more than three episodes per year), especially for those who have adverse effects from or contraindications for the use of antifungal agents, since adverse effects of probiotics are very rare. In any case women should be clearly informed about the unproven usefulness of probiotics for this purpose. In conclusion, despite the promising results of some studies, further research is needed to prove the effectiveness of probiotics in preventing the recurrences of VVC and to allow their wide use for this indication.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus as a cause of liver abscess in a NOD2/CARD15-positive patient with Crohn's disease.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The development of a fistula and/or an abscess are major complications in patients with Crohn's disease. An abscess can involve any of the major viscera, including the liver and spleen. CASE REPORT: A 27-year-old male patient with a 6-month history of NOD2/CARD15-positive Crohn's disease with stenosis of the terminal ileum, previously treated with corticosteroids, was admitted with fever, chills, diarrhea, fatigue and cachexia. Diagnostic work-up revealed sepsis, an abscess in the right hepatic lobe, multiple abdominal collections and right-sided pleural effusion. It was felt that his poor general condition prevented surgical intervention and complex conservative treatment was initiated. It consisted of total parenteral nutrition, antibiotics, percutaneous drainage of the liver abscess, and thoracocentesis. Pus and blood cultures showed Lactobacillus acidophilus. There was a gradual improvement in the patient's condition and the liver abscess decreased in diameter from 14 to 2 cm. Aminosalicylates and enteral nutrition were gradually introduced. The patient was discharged after 9 weeks in good general condition. CONCLUSION: Although extremely rarely, L. acidophilus can cause hepatic abscess and sepsis. This can be explained by immunologic incompetence due to corticosteroid treatment of Crohn's disease.
TI  - [Study of vaginal and intestinal microflora of women in the prenatal period and its correction in dysbacteriosis].
AB  - A comparative research of the structure of vaginal and intestinal microflora in norm and at kidney pathologies in women in the prenatal period was carried out. At physiologically normal course of pregnancy microbiocenosis of vagina and intestine does not contain pathogenic and conditional-pathogenic microorganisms. Lactic acid bacteria are fixed within the limits of 10(5)-10(8) CFU/1 ml in the vagina secretion and 10(7)-10(8) CFU/1 g in the intestine content. The spore microorganisms have completely disappeared in vaginal biocenosis of women with pyelonephritis after pharmacotherapy; and colibacterias has disappeared in 62% of women. Quantity of lactic acid bacteria has also decreased. Quantity of E. coli (10(8)- 10(9)) CFU/g, sporous microorganisms (10(3)-10(4)) CFU/g and yeast (10(4)-10(5)) CFU/g has considerably increased in the content of intestine. Lactic acid bacteria in content of the vagina are presented by: Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. vaginalis; in content of the intestine--L. plantarum and L. fermentum. All the isolated strains of lactobacilli are resistant to metrogyl and amphotericin, 87%--to cephoxitine, cypropfloxacine. Twenty three of 24 strains of lactic acid bacteria--antagonists of pathogenic microflora have shown adhesion to vaginal epthelium. The degree of adhesive activity depends on the strain and genus specificity of cultures. The highest index of adhesiveness in indicated in Enterococcus faecium (5.82 - 7.62) and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (2.74 - 6.40) strains. The screening of strains has been performed, which suppress growth of gas-producing microflora. The strain of Lactobacillus plantarum 200D proved to be the most active one. A complex of cultures of the lactic bacteria providing normalization of microbial cenosis of the vagina in women in the prenatal period has been selected as based on the data obtained. The biotechnology of production of vaginal suppositories is developed.
TI  - [Effectiveness of oral administration of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei F19 in association with vaginal suppositories of Lactobacillus acidofilus in the treatment of vaginosis and in the prevention of recurrent vaginitis].
AB  - AIM: The aim of this paper was to estimate the effectiveness of the contemporary  oral administration of Lactobacilllus paracasei subsp paracasei F19 in association with vaginal suppositories containing Lactobacilllus acidofilus in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis and in the prevention of recurrent vaginitis. METHODS: We have recruited 60 women in good health, aged between 18 and 40 years with suspect or confirmed diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. The women were randomized in 2 groups: Group A treated with vaginal suppositories containing Lactobacillus acidofilus (Calagin, SIFFRA, Florence); Group B treated with the same vaginal suppositories + probiotic containing Lactobacilllus paracasei subsp paracasei F 19 for oral administration (Gene-filus F19, SIFFRA, Florence). The patients were examined at the end of therapy (3 months) and then after 3 months from the end of treatment. RESULTS: In both groups at end of therapy there was a significant reduction of vaginal pH, an improvement of sniff test and of the subjective symptomatology after 3 months of treatment which still decreased during follow-up (3 months). In Group B there was a meaningful reduction of vaginal pH and of sniff test at the end of therapy and a maintenance of positive effect also after 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in this study show that the therapy with vaginal Lactobacillus in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis is successful. The association of oral administration is useful to balance the vaginal environment with the intestinal microflora with improvement of long-term results. The use of probiotics was determinant in the treatment of a pathology like bacterial vaginosis and as an alternative to the conventional local antibiotic therapies.
TI  - [Applyed aspects of molecular biology of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus].
AB  - The data obtained in the molecular genetic studies of the representatives of the  genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus are given. At present the genomes of Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus plantarum sized 2,256.640, 1,993.564 and 3,308.274 base pairs respectively, were completely sequenced. The use of different methods of gene indication and gene typing essentially widened the existing notions of the species variety of these bacteria, made it possible to change the classification of known species and to find out new ones, vegetating in different biotopes of the human body. Molecular genetic approaches also ascertained the taxonomic position of production strains of lactic-acid bacteria used in food industry, helped determine the kinetics of the passage of probiotic strains of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli along the gastrointestinal tract, as well as determine the duration of their preservation in the intestine after oral administration. In addition, the data on the evaluation of the therapeutic effect of some preparations, probiotics and synbiotics, with determination of the population level of endogenic and orally introduced exogenic bifidobacteria and lactobacilli are presented.
TI  - Biotic and abiotic factors influencing in vitro growth of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in ruminant digestive contents.
AB  - The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of ruminants is the main reservoir of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, which is responsible for food-borne infections in humans that can lead to severe kidney disease. Characterization of biotic and abiotic factors that influence the carriage of these pathogens by the ruminant would help in the development of ecological strategies to reduce their survival in the GIT and to decrease the risk of contamination of animal products. We found that growth of E. coli O157:H7 in rumen fluid was inhibited by the autochthonous microflora. Growth was also reduced when rumen fluid came from sheep fed a mixed diet composed of 50% wheat and 50% hay, as opposed to a 100% hay diet. In fecal suspensions, E. coli O157:H7 growth was not suppressed by the autochthonous flora. However, a probiotic strain of Lactobacillus acidophilus inhibited E. coli O157:H7 growth in fecal suspensions. The inhibitory effect was dose dependent. These lactic acid bacteria could be a relevant tool for controlling O157:H7 development in the terminal part of the ruminant GIT, which has been shown to be the main site of colonization by these pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus DSM13241 as a probiotic in healthy adult cats.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of dietary supplementation with the probiotic strain Lactobacillus acidophilus DSM13241 in healthy adult cats. ANIMALS: 15 adult cats. PROCEDURES: Cats were fed a nutritionally complete dry food for 5 weeks. Fecal character was assessed daily, and a single fecal sample and 3-mL blood sample were collected for bacterial enumeration and hematologic analysis, respectively. Cats were then fed the same diet supplemented with L acidophilus DSM13241 (2 x 10(8) CFU/d) for 4.5 weeks. Repeat fecal and hematologic measurements were taken prior to the return to control diet for a 4-week period. RESULTS: The probiotic species was recovered from feces, demonstrating survival through the feline gastrointestinal tract. Probiotic supplementation was associated with increased numbers of beneficial Lactobacillus and L acidophilus groups in feces and decreased numbers of Clostridium spp and Enterococcus faecalis, indicating an altered bacterial balance in the gastrointestinal tract microflora. Fecal pH was also decreased suggesting a colonic environment selective for the beneficial lactic acid bacterial population. Systemic and immunomodulatory effects were associated with administration of L acidophilus DSM13241 including altered cell numbers within WBC subsets and enhanced phagocytic capacity in the peripheral granulocyte population. In addition, plasma endotoxin concentrations were decreased during probiotic feeding, and RBCs had a decreased susceptibility to osmotic pressure. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Probiotic strain L acidophilus DSM13241 fed at 2 x 10(8) CFU/d can alter the balance of gastrointestinal microflora in healthy cats. Furthermore, administration of this probiotic results in beneficial systemic and immunomodulatory effects in cats.
TI  - Improvement of protein production in lactic acid bacteria using 5'-untranslated leader sequence of slpA from Lactobacillus acidophilus. Improvement in protein production using UTLS.
AB  - The 5'-untranslated leader sequence (UTLS) of the slpA gene from Lactobacillus acidophilus contributes to mRNA stabilization by producing a 5' stem and loop structure, and a high-level expression system for the lactic acid bacteria was developed using the UTLS in this study. A plasmid, which expresses alpha-amylase under the control of the ldh promoter, was constructed by integrating the core promoter sequence with the UTLS. The role of the UTLS in increasing the copies of the alpha-amylase mRNA was proved by measuring alpha-amylase activity in the culture supernatant and the relative expression of alpha-amylase mRNA was determined by the quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Moreover, several expression systems were constructed by combining the core promoter sequence with the UTLS or with the partially deleted UTLS and the expression level was evaluated. The use of the UTLS led to the success in improving alpha-amylase expression in the two strains of Lactobacillus casei and Lactococcus lactis. The current study showed that the improvement in protein production using the UTLS could be applied to the expression system in the lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Efficacy of probiotics in prevention of acute diarrhoea: a meta-analysis of masked, randomised, placebo-controlled trials.
AB  - To evaluate the evidence for the use of probiotics in the prevention of acute diarrhoea, we did a meta-analysis of the available data from 34 masked, randomised, placebo-controlled trials. Only one trial was community based and carried out in a developing country. Most of the remaining 33 studies were carried out in a developed country in a health-care setting. Evaluating the evidence by types of acute diarrhoea suggests that probiotics significantly reduced antibiotic-associated diarrhoea by 52% (95% CI 35-65%), reduced the risk of travellers' diarrhoea by 8% (-6 to 21%), and that of acute diarrhoea of diverse causes by 34% (8-53%). Probiotics reduced the associated risk of acute diarrhoea among children by 57% (35-71%), and by 26% (7-49%) among adults. The protective effect did not vary significantly among the probiotic strains Saccharomyces boulardii, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and other strains used alone or in combinations of two or more strains. Although there is some suggestion that probiotics may be efficacious in preventing acute diarrhoea, there is a lack of data from community-based trials and from developing countries evaluating the effect on acute diarrhoea unrelated to antibiotic usage. The effect on acute diarrhoea is dependent on the age of the host and genera of strain used.
TI  - Lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. From the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. RESULTS: A novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. Each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called cscA, cscB, cscC and cscD. Clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus sakei, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and Bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of L. lactis ssp cremoris, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillius brevis, Oenococcus oeni, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Bacillus thuringiensis. These genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the Lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. All encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the Sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel WxL domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. Transcriptome analysis in L. plantarum shows that the cscA-D genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. Many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpA-mutant derivative of L. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. This is supported by the presence of predicted CRE-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated cscA-D gene clusters. CONCLUSION: We propose that the CscA, CscB, CscC and CscD proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. Primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.
TI  - Cellular and humoral systemic and mucosal immune responses stimulated in volunteers by an oral polybacterial immunomodulator "Dentavax".
AB  - The oral polybacterial immunomodulator Dentavax (D), composed of killed cells from Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and Lactobacillus acidophilus and their lysates was created for immunoprophylaxis and therapy of oral mucosa and parodont inflammations. The stimulating effect of the preparation was evaluated in twelve volunteers immunized for 10 consecutive days. On days 7, 14, 21, 28 and 49 after the last immunization peripheral blood (PB) lymphocyte subsets, T lymphocyte activation and PB phagocytic activity, were studied by flow cytometry. PB lymphocyte proliferative responses to PHA, rIL-2, LPS and D were evaluated radiometrically. The production of TNF-alpha in supernatants of in vitro stimulated lymphocytes and specific IgA, IgM and IgG antibodies in serum and saliva was determined by ELISA. Ultrastructural morphologic changes in T and B lymphocyte populations were also investigated. Although no significant changes in the levels of basic lymphocyte subsets were detected, the early/late (CD57+/CD57-) CD8 T effectors ratio was increased at the end of the studied period, as were the percentage of PHA-responding (CD69+) T cells and PB phagocytizing cells. The most prominent lymphoprolipherative responses were measured upon costimulation with LPS+D and PHA+D on day 21. Electron-microscopic studies demonstrated a significant effect of D on both T and B cell activity. TNF-alpha concentration increased progressively from day 7 till the end of the investigation. Maximal concentrations were observed after stimulation with D and LPS. An increased level of specific salivary and serum antibodies against the components of D was found, with highest levels between days 7 and 21. Specific secretory IgA predominated in saliva as compared to IgM and IgG. Our results demonstrate the stimulating effect of Dentavax on PB lymphocyte functional activity and the specific humoral systemic and mucosal immunity.
TI  - Probiotic lactobacilli and bacteraemia in Stockholm.
AB  - The objective of the present study was to determine the incidence of lactobacilli-induced bacteraemia in Stockholm, Sweden, between January 1998 and March 2004, and to identify the possible presence of probiotic strains. Isolated strains were checked for growth on selective lactobacilli-agar and the biochemical profiles were determined. The lactobacilli strains were further analysed with molecular methodologies to ascertain eventual similarities with the probiotic strains Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei F19 (LMG P 17806), Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFB 1748 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (ATCC 53103). The minimum inhibitory concentrations of selected antimicrobial agents were determined by the agar dilution method. The incidence of bacteraemia cases caused by lactobacilli remained at the same level during the study period and constituted to <1% of the total number of bacteraemia cases each y. L. paracasei subsp. paracasei F19, L. acidophilus NCFB 1748 and L. rhamnosus GG were not identified in any of the samples.
TI  - Manufacturing of fermented goat milk with a mixed starter culture of Bifidobacterium animalis and Lactobacillus acidophilus in a controlled bioreactor.
AB  - AIMS: This work was undertaken to study the feasibility and the characteristics of a fermented product made of goat milk, using a mixed starter culture of Bifidobacterium animalis and Lactobacillus acidophilus under controlled conditions, and to determine their survival in the fermented milk during refrigerated storage. METHODS AND RESULTS: Goat milk was inoculated with Lact. acidophilus and Bif. animalis mixed starter, fermented in a glass bioreactor with controlled temperature (37 degrees C) and anaerobiosis, and monitored for growth and acidification. The fermented milk was then stored for 10 days under refrigeration, and monitored daily for starter microflora survival and pH changes. Lact. acidophilus viable counts reached a maximum of 7.1 x 10(8) colony-forming units (CFU) ml(-1), and Bif. animalis a maximum of 6.3 x 10(7) CFU ml(-1) by 20 h of fermentation. During refrigerated storage, both strains exhibited a good survival, with viable numbers remaining essentially constant throughout the experiment, whereas the pH of the fermented milk dropped slightly. CONCLUSIONS: Mixed cultures of Bif. animalis and Lact. acidophilus may be used to produce fermented goat milk with high counts of both probiotic strains. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Goat milk fermented with Bif. animalis and Lact. acidophilus can be manufactured as an alternative probiotic dairy product.
TI  - Bioproduction of conjugated linoleic acid by probiotic bacteria occurs in vitro and in vivo in mice.
AB  - Probiotics have been shown to reduce the incidence of colon cancer in animal models. The mechanisms responsible for this activity are poorly defined. Conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) are a group of isomers of linoleic acid (LA) possessing anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties, which can be produced from LA by certain bacterial strains. In this study, the ability of probiotic bacteria to exert anticarcinogenic effects through the production of CLA was assessed. Incubation of probiotic bacteria (VSL3, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. casei, L. plantarum, Bifidobacterium breve, B. infantis, B. longum, and Streptococcus thermophilus) in the presence of LA yielded CLA production as measured by gas chromatography. Conditioned medium, containing probiotic-produced CLA, reduced viability and induced apoptosis of HT-29 and Caco-2 cells, as assessed by MTT assay and DNA laddering, respectively. Western blotting demonstrated an increased expression of PPARgamma in cells treated with conditioned medium compared with LA alone. Incubation of murine feces with LA after administering VSL3 yielded 100-fold more CLA than feces collected prior to VSL3 feeding. This study supports a role for supplemental probiotics as a strategy both for attenuating inflammation and for preventing colon cancer.
TI  - Viability of vaginal probiotic lactobacilli during refrigerated and frozen storage.
AB  - The viability of six different strains of probiotic vaginal Lactobacillus was examined in two different cryoprotective media, during refrigerated versus frozen storage, and using two traditional types of stock cultures for starting the biomass production. Freezing at -20 degrees C and -70 degrees C had much less adverse effect on viability than did storage at 7 degrees C, and the reduction in viability was greater at -20 degrees C than at -70 degrees C. The strains showed variation in the extent of the viability losses during both types of storage. Milk-yeast extract (MYE) was shown to be the more suitable protective medium to maintain viability of the strains during the storage. The vaginal Lactobacillus strains are most stable in MYE at -70 degrees C with only a small decrease of the viability observed under these conditions. The viable cell counts of Lactobacillus paracasei CRL 1251 and CRL 1289, L. crispatus CRL 1266 and L. salivarius CRL 1328 remained around 1 x 10(8) CFU/mL after 24 months of storage at -70 degrees C, or up to 18 months for L. acidophilus CRL 1259.

TI  - Antagonistic activity of probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria against entero- and uropathogens.
AB  - AIM: To develop in vitro assays for comparing the antagonistic properties and anti-oxidative activity of probiotic Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains against various entero- and urinary pathogens. METHODS AND RESULTS: The antagonistic activity of five probiotic lactobacilli (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus fermentum ME-3, Lactobacillus acidophilus La5, Lactobacillus plantarum 299v and Lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2) and two bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12, Bifidobacterium longum 46) against six target pathogens was estimated using different assays (solid and liquid media, anaerobic and microaerobic cultivation) and ranked (low, intermediate and high). Bacterial fermentation products were determined by gas chromatography, and the total anti-oxidative activity of probiotics was measured using linolenic acid test. Pyelonephritic Escherichia coli was highly suppressed by GG and both bifidobacteria strains. Lactobacilli strains 8700:2, 299v and ME-3 were the most effective against Salmonella enterica ssp. enterica in microaerobic while ME-3 and both bifidobacteria expressed high activity against Shigella sonnei in anaerobic milieu. Lact. paracasei, Lact. rhamnosus and Lact. plantarum strains showed intermediate antagonistic activity against Helicobacter pylori under microaerobic conditions on solid media. The highest anti-oxidative activity was characteristic for Lact. fermentum ME-3 (P < 0.05). No efficient antagonist against Clostridium difficile was found. The positive correlations between the pH, lactic acid production and anti-microbial activity for all tested probiotics were assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Developed experimental assays enable to compare the anti-microbial and -oxidative activity of Lactobacillus and/or Bifidobacterium probiotics, which have been claimed to possess the ability of suppressing the growth of various enteric and urinary pathogens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Screening Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium sp. strains according to their activity in various environmental conditions could precede the clinical efficacy studies for adjunct treatment with probiotics in cure of different gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections.
TI  - Probiotic treatment of collagenous colitis: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. Lactis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotic treatment may be effective in diseases involving gut microflora and intestinal inflammation. In collagenous colitis (CC), a potential pathogenic role of the gut microflora has been proposed. The effect of probiotic treatment in CC is unknown. Our aim was to investigate the clinical effect of treatment with Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 (AB-Cap-10) in patients with CC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with CC and diarrhea were in a double-blind placebo-controlled study randomized (2:1) to AB-Cap-10 or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary end point was reduction in bowel frequency per week of >or=50%. Secondary end points were changes in bowel frequencies, stool consistency, stool weight, histopathology, and abdominal bloating and pain. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were randomized: 21 to probiotics and 8 to placebo. Reduction in bowel frequency per week of >or=50% occurred in 6 of 21 (29%) and in 1 of 8 (13%) patients receiving probiotic and placebo, respectively (P = 0.635). No differences between treatments were observed regarding the secondary end points. Post hoc analysis showed a median reduction in bowel frequency per week from 32 (range 18-84) to 23 (range 11-56; P < 0.005), a reduction in number of days with liquid stools per week from 6 days (range 0-7 days) to 1 day (range 0-7 days; P < 0.005), and an increase in number of days with solid stools per week (P < 0.05) in the AB-Cap-10 group. CONCLUSIONS: AB-Cap-10 had no significant effect on the chosen end points. Post hoc analysis demonstrated amelioration of clinical symptoms in the AB-Cap-10 group, indicating that probiotic treatment may potentially influence the disease course of CC.
TI  - Pectin-like acidic polysaccharide from Panax ginseng with selective antiadhesive  activity against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Previous studies have revealed the inhibitory effects of an acidic polysaccharide purified from the root of Panax ginseng against the adhesion of Helicobacter pylori to gastric epithelial cells and the ability of Porphyromonas gingivalis to agglutinate erythrocytes. In this study, this acidic polysaccharide from P. ginseng, PG-F2, was investigated further, in order to characterize its antiadhesive effects against Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Propionibacterium acnes, and Staphylococcus aureus. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were found to be in a range of 0.25-0.5mg/mL. However, results showed no inhibitory effects of PG-F2 against Lactobacillus acidophilus, Escherichia coli, or Staphylococcus epidermidis. PG-F2 is a pectin-type polysaccharide with a mean MW of 1.2 x 10(4) Da, and consists primarily of galacturonic and glucuronic acids along with rhamnose, arabinose, and galactose as minor components. The complete hydrolysis of PG-F2 via chemical or carbohydrolase enzyme treatment resulted in the abrogation of its antiadhesive activity, but limited hydrolysis via treatment with pectinase (EC. 3.2.1.15) yielded an oligosaccharide fraction, with activity comparable to the precursor PG-F2 (the MIC of ca. 0.01 mg/mL against H. pylori and P. gingivalis). Our results suggest that PG-F2 may exert a selective antiadhesive effect against pathogenic bacteria, while having no effects on beneficial and commensal bacteria.
TI  - Black esophagus: report of six cases and review of the literature, 1963-2003.
AB  - Black esophagus is the uncommon endoscopic finding of extensive black discoloration of the esophageal mucosa, usually from acute esophageal necrosis. Six cases of black esophagus were seen at Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minnesota, USA) from 1997 through 2003, and 46 cases were reported in the English-language literature from 1963 through 2003. We studied the demographics, clinical features, and outcomes of these 52 cases of black esophagus. Age and sex were known for 50 patients: the mean (SD) age was 65 years (19), and 42 patients (84%) were men. Symptoms were known for 51 patients: the most common symptom was upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding, occurring in 40 patients (78%). All 52 patients had at least one comorbid condition (with most having two or more), including duodenal ulcer in 17 (33%), cancer in 15 (29%), renal insufficiency in 15 (29%), and diabetes mellitus in 14 (28%). The suspected cause of black esophagus was reported for 40 patients: ischemia in 22 (55%); massive gastroesophageal reflux in seven (18%); and esophageal infection (Lactobacillus acidophilus, herpes simplex, Candida albicans) in four (10%). Most patients received supportive therapy, particularly acid suppression therapy. Of the 47 patients for whom outcomes were known, 17 (36%) died. There were no statistically significant differences between survivors and non-survivors. Black esophagus typically occurs in older men with at least one comorbid condition; a substantial number of patients die. Although the underlying mechanism leading to black esophagus is unknown, clinicians caring for patients with black esophagus should focus on optimizing perfusion, minimizing acid reflux, and treating esophageal infection if present.

TI  - Viability of human-derived probiotic lactobacilli in ice cream produced with sucrose and aspartame.
AB  - A mixture of human-derived probiotic strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. agilis and L. rhamnosus was used as a probiotic culture in ice cream manufacture. Viability and survival of these probiotic cultures were investigated in two different ice cream formulations. Ice cream with sucrose and ice cream with aspartame were prepared and each of these was divided into two subgroups: one with direct addition of the probiotic culture and one with milk fermented by the same probiotic culture. Ice cream samples were stored at -20 degrees C for 6 months and the survival rate of cultures were determined monthly. Probiotic cultures underwent tests for resistance to bile salts, antibiotics, acidic conditions; they were found to be highly resistant to such challenges. Chemical analysis of ice cream samples, such as determination of acidity, pH and solid matter, was also performed. The probiotic cultures remained unchanged in ice cream stored for up to 6 months regardless of the sweeteners used. Using probiotic cultures in ice cream mixes did not alter the characteristics of the product.
TI  - Effect of oral bacteria on growth and survival of Candida albicans biofilms.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of eight aerobic and anaerobic oral commensal bacterial species on in vitro Candida albicans biofilm development. A single isolate of C. albicans 2560 g, and eight different species of oral bacteria comprising, Actinomyces israelii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Prevotella nigrescens, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus intermedius were studied using an in vitro biofilm assay. Biofilm formation was quantified in terms of the ability of Candida to grow on polystyrene plastic surfaces co-cultured with the foregoing bacteria. A viable cell count was used to quantify the sessile yeast growth and scanning electron microscopy was employed to confirm and visualize biofilm formation. Co-culture with differing concentrations of bacteria had variable effects on Candida biofilm formation. Co-culture with the highest concentrations of each of the foregoing bacteria resulted in a consistent reduction in the yeast counts in the candidal biofilm (P<0.05), except for L. acidophilus, S. mutans, and, S. intermedius co-cultures. Further, on regression analysis a significant negative correlation between the co-culture concentration of either P. gingivalis or E. coli and viable yeast counts in the biofilm was noted (P<0.05) although this was not evident for the other bacterial species. Taken together, our data indicate that, quantitative and qualitative nature of the bacteria modulate C. albicans biofilm formation in mixed species environments such as the oral cavity.
TI  - Effects of Lactobacillus strains on cancer cell proliferation and oxidative stress in vitro.
AB  - AIMS: The objective of this study was to assess in vitro, whether heat-killed (HK) lactic acid bacteria cells and fractionations of HK cells could suppress the viability of human cancer cells and inhibit the cytotoxicity associated with oxidative stress. METHODS AND RESULTS: Among the strains, the HK cells of Lactobacillus acidophilus 606 and Lactobacillus casei ATCC 393 exhibited the most profound inhibitory activity in all of the tested cell lines. HK cells of L. acidophilus 606 were determined to be less toxic to healthy human embryo fibroblasts (hEF cells) than were HK cells of L. casei ATCC 393. The soluble polysaccharides from L. acidophilus 606 evidenced the most effective anticancer activity, but inhibited hEF cell growth by only 20%. The soluble polysaccharides from L. acidophilus 606 were partly observed to induce apoptosis in the HT-29 cells by DNA fragmentation and propidium iodine staining. Both the HK cells of L. acidophilus 606 and the soluble polysaccharide components of this strain also exhibited potent antioxidative activity. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the soluble polysaccharide fraction from L. acidophilus 606 may constitute a novel anticancer agent, which manifests a high degree of selectivity for human cancer cells and antioxidative agent in the food industry. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These soluble polysaccharide components from Lactobacillus may be applied to various foods, and used as adjuncts for cancer therapy and prevention.
TI  - Effect of Lactobacillus isolates on the adhesion of pathogens to chicken intestinal mucus in vitro.
AB  - AIMS: The aims of this study were to investigate in vitro the effects of Lactobacillus isolates from a chicken on adhesion of pathogenic Salmonella and Escherichia coli to chicken intestinal mucus obtained from different intestinal regions. METHODS AND RESULTS: Bacteria were labelled by using methyl-1,2-[(3)H]-thymidine. The bacterial adhesion was assessed by measuring the radioactivity of bacteria adhered to the mucus. The results showed that the abilities of Lactobacillus spp. to bind to the same intestinal mucus were higher than those of pathogenic Salmonella and E. coli. Pretreatment of intestinal mucus with Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus acidophilus, alone or in combination, reduced the adhesion of the tested pathogens, but the reductive extent of pathogenic adhesion by Lactobacillus spp. in combination was relatively high. CONCLUSIONS: The tested bacteria had different adhesions to mucus glycoproteins isolated from different intestinal regions of chicken. Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lact. fermentum in combination revealed a better ability to inhibit attachments of Salmonella and E. coli to chicken intestinal mucus than Lactobacillus sp. alone. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: A mixture of intestinal Lactobacillus spp. from a chicken may play a protective role in excluding pathogenic Salmonella and E. coli from the intestine of chicken.
TI  - Selection of potentially probiotic Lactobacillus strains towards their inhibitory activity against poultry enteropathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Lactobacilli were isolated from chicken gastrointestinal tract and examined for their potentially probiotic properties towards their inhibitory activity against poultry enteropathogenic bacteria. Biochemical tests, ITS-PCR and cell wall protein analysis were used to characterize the Lactobacillus isolates. The identification of isolated Lactobacillus strains based on phenotypic properties was not always satisfactory. ITS-PCR together with protein profile were found to be helpful in strain identification. Lactobacilli were tested for the inhibitory activity against selected strains of poultry enteropathogenic bacteria (Salmonella Enteritidis, Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens). Examined supernatants from Lactobacillus broth cultures demonstrated major antimicrobial activity against C. perfringens. Lower antimicrobial activity were observed against E. coli and Salmonella Enteritidis. The strongest inhibition effect were obtained using supernatant of Lactobacillus acidophilus strain 3D. Results received from this study confirmed that identification of Lactobacillus spp. is often tedious. Some isolates, which are in vitro antagonistic against enteropathogenic bacteria may be considered as potential candidates for poultry probiotics, especially in controlling necrotic enteritis caused by C. perfringens.
TI  - The elimination of ochratoxin A by lactic acid bacteria strains.
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine 29 strains of lactic acid bacteria of the Lactobacillus and Lactococcus genera, assessing their sensitivity to ochratoxin A and their ability to remove it from a liquid medium. It was demonstrated that most strains are insensitive to the presence of OTA at the quantity of 5 microg/disc. It was demonstrated that all strains caused a reduction of the toxin amount in the liquid medium. The highest decrease, exceeding 50% of the initial OTA content, was caused by the strains Lactobacillus acidophilus CH-5, L. rhamnosus GG, L. plantarum BS, L. brevis and L. sanfranciscensis. The example of three selected strains confirmed the negative effect of the toxin on the dynamics of bacterial growth. A sharp decrease of ochratoxin A was observed during the first 15 hours of culture growth. In the course of cultivation the amount of the toxin in the medium increased, indicating that the toxin elimination is partially reversible. A small quantity of ochratoxin A became bound to the bacterial biomass.
TI  - Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of fecal Lactobacillus species in infants receiving a prebiotic infant formula.
AB  - The developing intestinal microbiota of breast-fed infants is considered to play  an important role in the priming of the infants' mucosal and systemic immunity. Generally, Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus predominate the microbiota of breast-fed infants. In intervention trials it has been shown that lactobacilli can exert beneficial effects on, for example, diarrhea and atopy. However, the Lactobacillus species distribution in breast-fed or formula-fed infants has not yet been determined in great detail. For accurate enumeration of different lactobacilli, duplex 5' nuclease assays, targeted on rRNA intergenic spacer regions, were developed for Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus reuteri, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. The designed and validated assays were used to determine the amounts of different Lactobacillus species in fecal samples of infants receiving a standard formula (SF) or a standard formula supplemented with galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides in a 9:1 ratio (OSF). A breast-fed group (BF) was studied in parallel as a reference. During the 6-week intervention period a significant increase was shown in total percentage of fecal lactobacilli in the BF group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.1% +/- 1.5%) and the OSF group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.4% +/- 1.4%). The Lactobacillus species distribution in the OSF group was comparable to breast-fed infants, with relatively high levels of L. acidophilus, L. paracasei, and L. casei. The SF-fed infants, on the other hand, contained more L. delbrueckii and less L. paracasei compared to breast-fed infants and OSF-fed infants. An infant milk formula containing a specific mixture of prebiotics is able to induce a microbiota that closely resembles the microbiota of BF infants.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus bacteraemia after use of a probiotic in a patient with  AIDS and Hodgkin's disease.
AB  - We report the case of a patient who developed bacteraemia and septic pulmonary emboli with Lactobacillus acidophilus after taking a probiotic containing this organism.
TI  - Reversal in fatigued athletes of a defect in interferon gamma secretion after administration of Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fatigue and impaired performance in athletes is well recognised and has been loosely linked to "overtraining". Reduced concentration of IgA in the saliva and increased shedding of Epstein Barr virus (EBV) have been associated with intense training in elite athletes. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether athletes presenting with fatigue and impaired performance had an immune defect relevant to defective containment of EBV infection, and whether a probiotic preparation (Lactobacillus acidophilus) shown to enhance mucosal immunity in animal models could reverse any detected abnormality. RESULTS: The fatigued athletes had clinical characteristics consistent with re-activation of EBV infection and significantly (p = 0.02) less secretion of interferon (IFN) gamma from blood CD4 positive T cells. After one month of daily capsules containing 2 x 10(10) colony forming units of L acidophilus, secretion of IFNgamma from T cells had increased significantly (p = 0.01) to levels found in healthy control athletes. A significant (p = 0.03) increase in salivary IFNgamma concentrations in healthy control athletes after the one month course of L acidophilus demonstrated in man the capacity for this probiotic to enhance the mucosal IFNgamma concentration. CONCLUSION: This is the first evidence of a T cell defect in fatigued athletes, and of its reversal following probiotic therapy.
TI  - Micronutrients (including zinc) reduce diarrhoea in children: the Pakistan Sprinkles Diarrhoea Study.
AB  - AIMS: To examine the effect of the daily use of micronutrients (including zinc) or the same micronutrients plus heat inactivated lactic acid bacteria (LAB), on diarrhoea in children compared to placebo. METHODS: A triple blind randomised clinical trial in an urban slum of Karachi, Pakistan. Micronutrients (including zinc), micronutrients (including zinc and LAB), or placebo, were provided daily for two months to 75 young children (aged 6-12 months) identified at high risk for diarrhoea related mortality on the basis of history of at least one episode of diarrhoea in the preceding two weeks. The longitudinal prevalence of diarrhoea was defined as the percentage of days a child had diarrhoea out of the days the child was observed. RESULTS: Mean longitudinal prevalence of diarrhoea in the micronutrient-zinc group was 15% (SD = 10%) child-days compared to 26% (SD = 20%) child-days in the placebo group and 26% (SD = 19%) child-days in the micronutrient-zinc-LAB group. The difference between the micronutrient-zinc-LAB and placebo groups was not significant. CONCLUSION: The daily provision of micronutrients (including zinc) reduces the longitudinal prevalence of diarrhoea and thus may also reduce diarrhoea related mortality in young children; heat inactivated LAB has negative effects in these children.
TI  - Effects of sonic energy on monospecific biofilms of cariogenic microorganisms.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the in vitro differential effect of sonic energy, delivered  by Sonicare Advance, on cariogenic and non-cariogenic bacteria biofilms. METHODS: A wild strain of Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus salivarius and Veillonella alcalescens was isolated from human dental plaque. For each of the four microorganisms a biofilm adherent to bovine enamel disks, coated with artificial saliva, was obtained. Biofilms were divided into four groups and were exposed to acoustic energy delivered by Sonicare for 0 (control group), 5, 15 and 30 seconds. The distance between the end of the bristles and the disk surface was set to 7 mm, to ensure that the biofilm removal was simply due to fluid forces and not to the contact with the bristle tips during the brushing cycle. A colorimetric technique (MTT assay), based on the reduction of a yellow tetrazolium salt to a purple formazan, was used to evaluate the reduction of the adherent biomass after the exposure to the sonic energy. RESULTS: ANOVA results showed that sonic energy exposure significantly reduced the biomass of S. mutans and S. salivarius adherent to the disks, while L. acidophilus and V. alcalescens seemed to remain basically unaffected. In the two streptococcal groups, the increase of the exposure time led to different reduction trends; while S. salivarius exhibited a progressive decrease over time, S. mutans showed a rapid reduction of the adherent biomass after a 15-second exposure to Sonicare.
TI  - [Monkeys as subjects for study of immunobiological preparations].
AB  - The parameters of colon microbiocenosis were evaluated in healthy animals belonging to 6 species of marmosets; its disorders typical of patients with different forms of acute intestinal infections were revealed. Bifidoflora of young monkeys was characterized. The study demonstrated multiple similarities of the microflora of monkeys and humans, including small children. A preclinical study of dry bifidin, a probiotic, revealed its advantages over the commercial bifidumbacterin. 90 monkeys were used for preclinical evaluation of complex immunoglobulin preparation (CIP) and a combination of CIP with interferon (kipferon in suppositories). The study demonstrated sanifying and microflora-normalizing effects, increase of anti-microbial antibodies and serum interferon after both parenteral and rectal administration. The protective activity of a new variant of the probiotic Acilact in exposure to ionizing radiation and anticancer chemotherapy under experimental conditions
TI  - [The protective activity of a new variant of the probiotic Acilact in exposure to ionizing radiation and anticancer chemotherapy under experimental conditions].
AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate the protective activity of a new variant  of the probiotic Acilact in exposure to ionizing radiation and anticancer chemotherapy under experimental conditions. The study revealed protective effects of the preparation after combined exposure of mice to radiation and temperature. The preparation increased 30-day survival of the mice, inhibited intestinal colonization with gram-negative microorganisms, and increased resistance to LPS. A multidirectional protective effect of the probiotic was observed after the use of sublethal doses of radiation; this effect was manifested by quicker normalization of hematological parameters and bone marrow cellularity, as well as elevation of blood concentration of the hemoragulatory cytokines IL-3 and IL-6.
TI  - Two families of rep-like genes that probably originated by interspecies recombination are represented in viral, plasmid, bacterial, and parasitic protozoan genomes.
AB  - Two families of genes related to, and including, rolling circle replication initiator protein (Rep) genes were defined by sequence similarity and by evidence of intergene family recombination. The Rep genes of circoviruses were the best characterized members of the "RecRep1 family." Other members of the RecRep1 family were Rep-like genes found in the genomes of the Canarypox virus, Entamoeba histolytica, and Giardia duodenalis and in a plasmid, p4M, from the Gram-positive bacterium, Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum. The "RecRep2 family" comprised some previously identified Rep-like genes from plasmids of phytoplasmas and similar Rep-like genes from the genomes of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactococcus lactis, and Phytoplasma asteris. Both RecRep1 and RecRep2 proteins have a nucleotide-binding domain significantly similar to the helicases (2C proteins) of picorna-like viruses. On the N-terminal side of the nucleotide binding domain, RecRep1 proteins have a domain significantly similar to one found in nanovirus Reps, whereas RecRep2 proteins have a domain significantly similar to one in the Reps of pLS1 plasmids. We speculate that RecRep genes have been transferred from viruses or plasmids to parasitic protozoan and bacterial genomes and that Rep proteins were themselves involved in the original recombination events that generated the ancestral RecRep genes.
TI  - Probiotics and commensals reverse TNF-alpha- and IFN-gamma-induced dysfunction in human intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Commensal bacteria are crucial for the development of the mucosal immune system. Probiotics are commensals with special characteristics and may protect mucosal surfaces against pathogens. Pathogens cause significant phenotypic alterations in infected epithelial cells, and probiotics reverse these deleterious responses. We hypothesized that probiotics and/or commensals may also reverse epithelial damage produced by cytokines. METHODS: Human intestinal epithelial cells were exposed basolaterally to interferon (IFN)-gamma (10(3) U/mL) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (10 ng/mL) for up to 48 hours and assessed for ion transport, transepithelial resistance (TER), and epithelial permeability in the presence or absence of probiotics (Streptococcus thermophilus [ST] and Lactobacillus acidophilus [LA]), or the commensal, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (BT). RESULTS: Agonist-stimulated chloride secretion was inhibited by IFN-gamma, an effect prevented by ST/LA or BT. The ability of ST/LA or BT to restore Cl(-) secretion was blocked by inhibitors of p38 MAPK, ERK1, 2, and PI3K. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and the NKCC1 cotransporter were down-regulated by IFN-gamma, and ST/LA pretreatment reversed this effect. Both TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma significantly reduced TER and increased epithelial permeability, effects prevented by ST/LA or BT. A Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor synergistically potentiated effects of ST/LA or BT on TER and permeability, but p38, ERK1, 2, or PI3K inhibition did not. Finally, only probiotic-treated epithelial cells exposed to cytokines showed reduced activation of SOCS3 and STAT1,3. CONCLUSIONS: Deleterious effects of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma on epithelial function are prevented by probiotic, and to a lesser extent, commensal pretreatment. These data extend the spectrum of effects of such bacteria on intestinal epithelial function and may justify their use in inflammatory disorders.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antibacterial activity of Arctium lappa as a phytotherapeutic agent used in intracanal dressings.
AB  - The discovery of natural biocomponents from plants with antibacterial activity on endodontic microbiota may lead to new therapies. This study evaluated the antibacterial activity of a phytotherapeutic agent prepared from an ethyl acetate fraction (AcOEt) extracted from Arctium lappa. This agent was compared with calcium hydroxide as an intracanal dressing. Twenty-seven maxillary canines were instrumented, sterilized and inoculated with a mixed bacterial suspension of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans. The teeth were divided into three groups and their canals filled with: group 1, calcium hydroxide and propylene glycol; group 2, a paste containing AcOEt fraction of A. lappa and propylene glycol; group 3, propylene glycol (control). At 7, 14 and 30 days, three teeth from each group were opened and a paper point was placed in the root canal for 5 min. The paper points were transferred to Petri dishes with Brain Heart Infusion (BHI). The bacterial growth was classified. Mild bacterial growth was found in group 1 at all time intervals; in group 2 there was severe growth at 7 days, but no growth at 14 and 30 days. The phytotherapeutic agent extracted from an AcOEt fraction of A. lappa inhibited the growth of all the microorganisms in this study.
TI  - Casein-derived antimicrobial peptides generated by Lactobacillus acidophilus DPC6026.
AB  - Three peptides produced by a Lactobacillus acidophilus DPC6026 fermentation of sodium caseinate and showing antibacterial activity against pathogenic strains Enterobacter sakazakii ATCC 12868 and Escherichia coli DPC5063 were characterized. These peptides were all generated from bovine alpha(s1)-casein and identified as IKHQGLPQE, VLNENLLR, and SDIPNPIGSENSEK. These peptides may have bioprotective applicability and potential use in milk-based formula, which has been linked to E. sakazakii infection in neonates.
TI  - Supplementation of the diet with high-viscosity beta-glucan results in enrichment for lactobacilli in the rat cecum.
AB  - BBn (BioBreeding) rats were fed casein-based diets supplemented with barley flour, oatmeal flour, cellulose, or barley beta-glucans of high [HV] or low viscosity [LV] in order to measure the prebiotic effects of these different sources of dietary fiber. The dietary impact on the composition of the cecal microbiota was determined by the generation of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene sequences. The DGGE profiles produced from the cecal microbiota of rats within each dietary group were similar, but consensus profiles generated from pooled bacterial DNAs showed differences between rat groups. Animals fed HV glucans (HV-fed rats) had DGGE consensus profiles that were 30% dissimilar from those of the other rat groups. A 16S rRNA gene fragment that was more conspicuous in the profiles of HV-fed animals than in those of cellulose-fed rats had sequence identity with Lactobacillus acidophilus. Measurements of L. acidophilus rRNA abundance (DNA-RNA hybridization), the preparation of cloned 16S rRNA gene libraries, and the enumeration of Lactobacillus cells (fluorescent in situ hybridization) showed that lactobacilli formed a greater proportion of the cecal microbiota in HV-fed rats. In vitro experiments confirmed that some lactobacilli utilize oligosaccharides (degree of polymerization, 3 or 4) present in beta-glucan hydrolysates. The results of this study have relevance to the use of purified beta-glucan products as dietary supplements for human consumption.
TI  - Transcriptional and functional analysis of oxalyl-coenzyme A (CoA) decarboxylase  and formyl-CoA transferase genes from Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Oxalic acid is found in dietary sources (such as coffee, tea, and chocolate) or is produced by the intestinal microflora from metabolic precursors, like ascorbic acid. In the human intestine, oxalate may combine with calcium, sodium, magnesium, or potassium to form less soluble salts, which can cause pathological disorders such as hyperoxaluria, urolithiasis, and renal failure in humans. In this study, an operon containing genes homologous to a formyl coenzyme A transferase gene (frc) and an oxalyl coenzyme A decarboxylase gene (oxc) was identified in the genome of the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus. Physiological analysis of a mutant harboring a deleted version of the frc gene confirmed that frc expression specifically improves survival in the presence of oxalic acid at pH 3.5 compared with the survival of the wild-type strain. Moreover, the frc mutant was unable to degrade oxalate. These genes, which have not previously been described in lactobacilli, appear to be responsible for oxalate degradation in this organism. Transcriptional analysis using cDNA microarrays and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR revealed that mildly acidic conditions were a prerequisite for frc and oxc transcription. As a consequence, oxalate-dependent induction of these genes occurred only in cells first adapted to subinhibitory concentrations of oxalate and then exposed to pH 5.5. Where genome information was available, other lactic acid bacteria were screened for frc and oxc genes. With the exception of Lactobacillus gasseri and Bifidobacterium lactis, none of the other strains harbored genes for oxalate utilization.
TI  - Global analysis of carbohydrate utilization by Lactobacillus acidophilus using cDNA microarrays.
AB  - The transport and catabolic machinery involved in carbohydrate utilization by Lactobacillus acidophilus was characterized genetically by using whole-genome cDNA microarrays. Global transcriptional profiles were determined for growth on glucose, fructose, sucrose, lactose, galactose, trehalose, raffinose, and fructooligosaccharides. Hybridizations were carried out by using a round-robin design, and microarray data were analyzed with a two-stage mixed model ANOVA. Differentially expressed genes were visualized by hierarchical clustering, volcano plots, and contour plots. Overall, only 63 genes (3% of the genome) showed a >4-fold induction. Specifically, transporters of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar transferase system were identified for uptake of glucose, fructose, sucrose, and trehalose, whereas ATP-binding cassette transporters were identified for uptake of raffinose and fructooligosaccharides. A member of the LacS subfamily of galactoside-pentose hexuronide translocators was identified for uptake of galactose and lactose. Saccharolytic enzymes likely involved in the metabolism of monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides into substrates of glycolysis were also found, including enzymatic machinery of the Leloir pathway. The transcriptome appeared to be regulated by carbon catabolite repression. Although substrate-specific carbohydrate transporters and hydrolases were regulated at the transcriptional level, genes encoding regulatory proteins CcpA, Hpr, HprK/P, and EI were consistently highly expressed. Genes central to glycolysis were among the most highly expressed in the genome. Collectively, microarray data revealed that coordinated and regulated transcription of genes involved in sugar uptake and metabolism is based on the specific carbohydrate provided. L. acidophilus's adaptability to environmental conditions likely contributes to its competitive ability for limited carbohydrate sources available in the human gastrointestinal tract.
TI  - [Study on effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus MG2-1 on serum lipid metabolism in  rats].
AB  - Wistar rats were fed with a high lipid diet supplemented with living or thermal death bacteria of Lactobacillus acidophilus MG2-1 which was isolated from koumiss in Mongolia and was of good ability of acid tolerance and decreasing the level of cholesterol in vitro. The effect of Lb. acidophilus MG2-1 on the metabolism of serum cholesterol was discussed. It was showed that it was on the 14th day of experiment that the inhibiting effects of the increase of serum cholesterol level of rat groups fed with living bacteria and heat-killed bacteria was significantly (p > 0.05) and very significantly (p < 0.01) higher than that of the high lipid diet group respectively; at the same time, the level of serum HDL-C of the thermal death bacteria group was significantly higher than that of the high lipid diet group (p < 0.05), also arteriosclerosis index of wistar rats in experimental group is significantly lower than that of the high lipid diet group (p < 0.01). The total bile acid level of the thermal death bacteria group in fecal is significantly higher than that of the high lipid diet group (p < 0.05). It is suggested that the increase of serum cholesterol level in rats can be inhibited and arteriosclerosis can also be prevented by this strain. During the period of tests, the effect of the strain on serum lipid in rats weaken with the time going, while the dose of bacteria fed was not changed.
TI  - Anticariogenic activity of macelignan isolated from Myristica fragrans (nutmeg) against Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The occurrence of dental caries is mainly associated with oral pathogens, especially cariogenic Streptococcus mutans. Preliminary antibacterial screening revealed that the extract of Myristica fragrans, widely cultivated for the spice and flavor of foods, possessed strong inhibitory activity against S. mutans. The anticariogenic compound was successfully isolated from the methanol extract of M. fragrans by repeated silica gel chromatography, and its structure was identified as macelignan by instrumental analysis using 1D-NMR, 2D-NMR and EI-MS. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of macelignan against S. mutans was 3.9 microg/ml, which was much lower than those of other natural anticariogenic agents such as 15.6 microg/ml of sanguinarine, 250 microg/ml of eucalyptol, 500 microg/ml of menthol and thymol, and 1000 microg/ml of methyl salicylate. Macelignan also possessed preferential activity against other oral microorganisms such as Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei in the MIC range of 2-31.3 microg/ml. In particular, the bactericidal test showed that macelignan, at a concentration of 20 microg/ml, completely inactivated S. mutans in 1 min. The specific activity and fast-effectiveness of macelignan against oral bacteria strongly suggest that it could be employed as a natural antibacterial agent in functional foods or oral care products.
TI  - Genetic diversity, dynamics, and activity of Lactobacillus community involved in  traditional processing of artisanal Manchego cheese.
AB  - A total of 248 strains of predominant lactobacilli isolated during the manufacture and ripening of artisanal Manchego cheeses obtained from two dairies were obtained and the genetic diversity of 197 investigated using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD-PCR). 51 isolates could not be lysed and were therefore not genotyped. Forty-two distinct RAPD patterns, grouped in six major clusters at a similarity level of 54%, were obtained. Phenotypic characterization of isolates enabled their assignment to the species L. plantarum, L. brevis, L. paracasei subsp. paracasei, L. fermentum, L. pentosus, L. acidophilus and L. curvatus. In samples from both dairies, the species L. plantarum, L. brevis and L. paracasei subsp. paracasei dominated during ripening. Three genotypes showed excellent physiological characteristics and were therefore proposed as adjunct cultures for Manchego cheese manufacture.
TI  - Use of unsupervised and supervised artificial neural networks for the identification of lactic acid bacteria on the basis of SDS-PAGE patterns of whole cell proteins.
AB  - Conventional multivariate statistical techniques (hierarchical cluster analysis,  linear discriminant analysis) and unsupervised (Kohonen Self Organizing Map) and supervised (Bayesian network) artificial neural networks were compared for as tools for the classification and identification of 352 SDS-PAGE patterns of whole cell proteins of lactic acid bacteria belonging to 22 species of the genera Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Enterococcus, Lactococcus and Streptococcus including 47 reference strains. Electrophoretic data were pre-treated using the logistic weighting function described by Piraino et al. [Piraino, P., Ricciardi, A., Lanorte, M. T., Malkhazova, I., Parente, E., 2002. A new procedure for data reduction in electrophoretic fingerprints of whole-cell proteins. Biotechnol. Lett. 24, 1477-1482]. Hierarchical cluster analysis provided a satisfactory classification of the patterns but was unable to discriminate some species (Leuconostoc, Lb. sakei/Lb. curvatus, Lb. acidophilus/Lb. helveticus, Lb. plantarum/Lb. paraplantarum, Lc. lactis/Lc. raffinolactis). A 7x7 Kohonen self-organizing map (KSOM), trained with the patterns of the reference strains, provided a satisfactory classification of the patterns and was able to discriminate more species than hierarchical cluster analysis. The map was used in predictive mode to identify unknown strains and provided results which in 85.5% of cases matched the classification obtained by hierarchical cluster analysis. Two supervised tools, linear discriminant analysis and a 23:5:2 Bayesian network were proven to be highly effective in the discrimination of SDS-PAGE patterns of Lc. lactis from those of other species. We conclude that data reduction by logistic weighting coupled to traditional multivariate statistical analysis or artificial neural networks provide an effective tool for the classification and identification of lactic acid bacteria on the basis of SDS-PAGE patterns of whole cell proteins.
TI  - Viability of commercial probiotic cultures (L. acidophilus, Bifidobacterium sp.,  L. casei, L. paracasei and L. rhamnosus) in cheddar cheese.
AB  - Six batches of cheddar cheese were manufactured containing different combinations of commercially available probiotic cultures from three suppliers. Duplicate cheeses contained the organisms of each supplier, a Bifidobacterium spp. (each supplier), a Lactobacillus acidophilus (2 suppliers), and either Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus paracasei, or Lactobacillus rhamnosus. Using selective media, the different strains were assessed for viability during cheddar cheese maturation over 32 weeks. The Bifidobacterium sp. remained at high numbers with the three strains being present in cheese at 4 x 10(7), 1.4 x 10(8), and 5 x 10(8) CFU/g after 32 weeks. Similarly the L. casei (2 x 10(7) CFU/g), L. paracasei (1.6 x 10(7) CFU/g), and L. rhamnosus (9 x 10(8) CFU/g) strains survived well; however, the L. acidophilus strains performed poorly with both decreasing in a similar manner to be present at 3.6 x 10(3) CFU/g and 4.9 x 10(3) CFU/g after 32 weeks. This study indicates that cheddar cheese is a good vehicle for a variety of commercial probiotics but survival of L. acidophilus strains will need to be improved.
TI  - Use of polymerase chain reaction techniques and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for differentiation of oral Lactobacillus species.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The genus Lactobacillus has been associated with dental caries in humans, although it is seldom speciated due to lack of simple and nonlaborious identification methods. A considerable heterogeneity among Lactobacillus species has been demonstrated. The purpose of this study was to develop simple methods combining restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified 16S rRNA (16S rRNA gene PCR-RFLP) and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) for the identification of 13 reference strains of Lactobacillus. METHODS: The 16S rRNA gene sequences were amplified by PCR using universal primers and digestion of PCR products with the restriction endonucleases, HpaII and HaeIII. The 16S rRNA gene PCR-RFLP is reproducible and has been proved to be useful for differentiating Lactobacillus strains to species level. Seventy-seven Lactobacillus isolates from a Thai population were used to show the applicability of the identification test. RESULTS: PCR-RFLP alone had limitations, because the RFLP patterns of Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus rhamnosus and of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus crispatus showed similar patterns; however, these could be differentiated by SDS-PAGE. Of the 77 isolates, 38 were identified as Lactobacillus fermentum, 25 as L. rhamnosus, 5 as Lactobacillus salivarius, 5 as L. casei, 3 as L. acidophilus and 1 as Lactobacillus plantarum. CONCLUSION: 16S rRNA gene PCR-RFLP, using HpaII and HaeIII, together with SDS-PAGE protein profiles could be an alternative method for the identification of oral Lactobacillus strains to species level, and may be applicable for large-scale studies on the association of Lactobacillus to dental caries.
TI  - Characterization of the tre locus and analysis of trehalose cryoprotection in Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM.
AB  - Freezing and lyophilization are common methods used for preservation and storage  of microorganisms during the production of concentrated starter cultures destined for industrial fermentations or product formulations. The compatible solute trehalose has been widely reported to protect bacterial, yeast and animal cells against a variety of environmental stresses, particularly freezing and dehydration. Analysis of the Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM genome revealed a putative trehalose utilization locus consisting of a transcriptional regulator, treR; a trehalose phosphoenolpyruvate transferase system (PTS) transporter, treB; and a trehalose-6-phosphate hydrolase, treC. The objective of this study was to characterize the tre locus in L. acidophilus and determine whether or not intracellular uptake of trehalose contributes to cryoprotection. Cells subjected to repeated freezing and thawing cycles were monitored for survival in the presence of various concentrations of trehalose. At 20% trehalose a 2-log increase in survival was observed. The trehalose PTS transporter and trehalose hydrolase were disrupted by targeted plasmid insertions. The resulting mutants were unable to grow on trehalose, indicating that both trehalose transport into the cell via a PTS and hydrolysis via a trehalose-6-phosphate hydrolase were necessary for trehalose fermentation. Trehalose uptake was found to be significantly reduced in the transporter mutant but unaffected in the hydrolase mutant. Additionally, the cryoprotective effect of trehalose was reduced in these mutants, suggesting that intracellular transport and hydrolysis contribute significantly to cryoprotection.
TI  - The use of probiotics in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.
AB  
TI  - Lactobacillus suntoryeus Cachat and Priest 2005 is a later synonym of Lactobacillus helveticus (Orla-Jensen 1919) Bergey et al. 1925 (Approved Lists 1980).
AB  - Strain R0052, isolated from a North American dairy starter culture, was initially identified as Lactobacillus acidophilus based on phenotypic analyses. However, upon sequencing the 16S rRNA gene, it became clear that the isolate was very highly related to Lactobacillus suntoryeus, Lactobacillus helveticus and Lactobacillus gallinarum, as similarities ranging from 99.3 to 99.8 % were observed. As an initial screening test to investigate the relatedness of strain R0052 and reference strains of L. suntoryeus, L. helveticus and L. gallinarum, the partial sequences for the genes encoding the alpha subunit of ATP synthase (atpA), RNA polymerase alpha subunit (rpoA), phenylalanyl-tRNA synthase alpha subunit (pheS), the translational elongation factor Tu (tuf), a surface-layer protein (slp) and the Hsp60 chaperonins (groEL) were determined and they revealed high relatedness between all of the strains. The determination of the 16S-23S rRNA internally transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences revealed 98.3-100% similarity between L. suntoryeus and L. helveticus strains. SDS-PAGE of whole-cell proteins did not distinguish between these species. Fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (FAFLP) could distinguish between these taxa, but they still constituted a single cluster within the L. acidophilus group. Finally, DNA-DNA hybridization experiments between strain R0052 and the type strains of L. helveticus and L. suntoryeus yielded reassociation values above 70% and confirmed that these names are synonyms.
TI  - Effects of Lactobacilli and lactose on Salmonella typhimurium colonisation and microbial fermentation in the crop of the young turkey.
AB  - 1. Three experiments were performed to examine the effects of Lactobacilli and lactose on microbial fermentation and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium colonisation in the crop of the young turkey. 2. The following carboxylic acids were detected in the crop ingesta: formic, acetic, butyric, lactic, valeric, caproic, oxalic, phenyl acetic, succinic and fumaric; propionic, isobutyric and isovaleric acids were not detectable. 3. At the beginning of the night, there were considerable quantities of ingesta in the crop of young turkeys. During the scotophase, there were progressive reductions in the contents and pH. Moreover, there were linear increases in the concentration of lactic, valeric and caproic acids (by approximately 7-fold over 8 h). Much smaller changes in crop pH were observed in the study where dietary treatments of Lactobacilli were not included. 4. Chronic addition of lactose or Lactobacilli to the diet exerted modest effects on the carboxylic acid concentration in the crop contents but did not consistently influence colonisation of the crop by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. 5. Young turkeys confine eating to the hours of illumination (photophase) with a peak in consumption prior to the subjective dusk.
TI  - Classification of lactic acid bacteria with UV-resonance Raman spectroscopy.
AB  - UV-resonance Raman spectroscopy is applied as a method for the identification of  lactic acid bacteria from yogurt. Eight different strains of bacteria from Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus were investigated. At an excitation wavelength of 244 nm signals from nucleic acids and proteins are selectively enhanced. Classification was accomplished using different chemometric methods. In a first attempt, the unsupervised methods hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis were applied to investigate natural grouping in the data. In a second step the spectra were analyzed using several supervised methods: K-nearest neighbor classifier, nearest mean classifier, linear discriminant analysis, and support vector machines.
TI  - Effect of regular ingestion of Saccharomyces boulardii plus inulin or Lactobacillus acidophilus LB in children colonized by Helicobacter pylori.
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the effect of a probiotic, Lactobacillus acidophilus LB (LB), or a synbiotic, Saccharomyces boulardii plus inulin (SbI), on Helicobacter pylori (Hp) colonization in children. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A clinical trial was carried out in a school from a low socio-economic area of Santiago. Two hundred and fifty-four asymptomatic children (8.40+/-1.62 y) were screened for Hp by the (13)C-Urea Breath Test ((13)C-UBT). Hp-positive children were randomly distributed into three groups to receive either antibiotic treatment (lanzoprazole, clarythromycin and amoxicillin) for 8 d, or SbI or LB daily for 8 wk. A second (13)C-UBT was carried out at this time. Spontaneous clearance was evaluated in the same way in 81 infected, untreated children. The differences in the delta(13)CO(2) over baseline values before and after treatments (?DOB) were evaluated. RESULTS: 182 subjects (71.7%) were colonized by Hp, and 141 of them completed their treatment (22.5% dropout). Hp was eradicated in 66%, 12% and 6.5% of the children from the Ab, SbI and LB groups, respectively, while no spontaneous clearance was observed in the children without treatment. A moderate but significant difference in ?DOB was detected in children receiving living SbI (-6.31; 95% CI: -11.84 to -0.79), but not in those receiving LB (+0.70; 95% CI: -5.84 to +7.24). CONCLUSION: S. boulardii seems promising as an agent that interferes with Hp in colonized individuals. More studies are needed to confirm these results and to elucidate the mechanisms by which Sb inhibits Hp.
TI  - [The effects of the microbial components of the probiotic Acilact on the cell-mediated immunity factors under experimental conditions].
AB  - The authors analyzed the effects of the microbial components of the probiotic Acilact on the cell-mediated factors of the immune homeostasis. According to the results, L. acidophilis stimulates the functional activity of immunocompetent cells, especially T-cell mediated immunity with strain- and dose-depending differences in intensity. The study demonstrated the ability of L. acidophilis to activate expression of the genes of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFNgamma, IL-6, 12, and TNFalpha), to induce production of IFNalpha and IFNgamma, and increase interferon production, with additional stimulation of lymphoid organ cells with specific inductors in vitro. The study established that L. acidophilis stimulates production of macrophage migration inhibition factor by immunocompetent cells of Peyer's plaques and the splen, and induces its quantitative increase in the serum of CBA mice. The study detected immunocorrecting effect of L. acidophilis by the example of experimental shigellous infection, demonstrated intensification of the prolipherative activity of immunocompetent T-cells, induction of the expression of the genes of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFNgamma, IL-1beta, 6, 12, and TNFalpha), but not IL4 and 10, increase of synthesis of IFNalpha and IFNgamma by the cells of Peyer's plaques, the splen and thymus. The obtained results prove the immunological effect of the probiotic preparation Acilact, based on the strains L. acidophilis NK1 and L. acidophilis K3(111)24.
TI  - [Acilact and improvement of the health status of sickly children].
AB  - A complex study of the effects of Acilact on the immune and interferon status, phagocyte defense, and cytokine balance in sickly children showed that Acilact had a positive effect on the immune system in these patients. The preparation is able to normalize abnormal immune parameters, and does not influence healthy immune system. In some ways Acilact has advantages over IRS 19 vaccine. Simultaneous administration of these two preparations is appropriate in some cases.

TI  - Short-term soy and probiotic supplementation does not markedly affect concentrations of reproductive hormones in postmenopausal women with and without histories of breast cancer.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Observational studies suggest that dietary isoflavones reduce breast  cancer risk, and this may be caused in part by effects on endogenous hormone concentrations. Because intestinal bacteria metabolize isoflavones, it was hypothesized that consumption of probiotic bacteria would enhance the biologic effects of isoflavones, including effects on endogenous hormones. DESIGN: Twenty (20) postmenopausal breast cancer survivors and 20 healthy postmenopausal women completed four 42-day diet periods in a randomized, crossover design. They received one of the following: isolated soy protein; isolated milk protein; soy + probiotic capsules; or milk + probiotic capsules. Each protein supplement provided 0.38 g protein/(kg body weight/day) (26.6 +/- 4.5 g protein/day) and soy protein provided 0.64 mg isoflavones/(kg body weight/day) (44.4 +/- 7.5 mg isoflavones/day). Probiotic capsules provided 10(9) colony-forming units Lactobacillus acidophilus (strain DDS-1), Bifidobacterium longum, and 15-20 mg fructo-oligosaccharide. MEASURES: Plasma samples were collected at baseline and after each diet for analysis of estrogens, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), androgens, and sex hormone?binding globulin (SHBG). RESULTS: Hormone levels were not affected by soy, probiotic supplements, or equol producer status, and neither cancer status nor equol producer status altered the effects of soy or probiotics. Furthermore probiotics did not alter the effects of soy consumption. Soy protein tended to decrease SHBG compared to milk protein diets (p = 0.05), although both proteins significantly decreased SHBG relative to baseline (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that short-term, moderate consumption of isoflavone-containing soy protein and consumption of these particular probiotic capsules do not significantly alter reproductive hormone concentrations in breast cancer survivors or controls, regardless of equol producer status.
TI  - Efficacy of tyndalized Lactobacillus acidophilus in acute diarrhea.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A double-blind randomized controlled-trial was done to evaluate the efficacy of tyndalized Lactobacillus acidophilus in acute diarrhea. METHODS: All children from 6 months to 12 years with acute diarrhea were included. Lactobacillus acidophilus/placebo was given to the children for 3 days with ORS and feeds. Intake-output was recorded 4 hourly. Of the 98 children, 48 received lactobacillus and 50 the placebo. RESULTS: ORS consumed, frequency of stools, duration of diarrhea, time for rehydration, hospital stay, weight gain and IVF needed were comparable in the two study groups. There were 4 treatment failures in the lactobacillus group and none in the placebo group (OR 0.92, 95%CI 0.84-0.99). In the rotaviral diarrhea and in those who had diarrhea of less then 60 hours the difference did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: There is no significant benefit of tyndalized Lactobacillus acidophilus in acute diarrhea.
TI  - Lactobacillus species isolated from the vagina: identification, hydrogen peroxide production and nonoxynol-9 resistance.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactic acid production is considered to be the major protection mechanism of lactobacilli against vaginal infections due to genital pathogens. Some species of Lactobacillus are also hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) producers. Nonoxynol-9 (N-9) is a nonionic detergent and is the active component of many spermicidal preparations. It immobilizes sperm by disrupting the cell membrane and is believed to act similarly on a number of bacteria and viruses. It is known that N-9 inhibits Lactobacilli in vitro at concentrations of 0.1% to 1%. PURPOSE: The present study was conducted to identify the species of Lactobacillus isolated from vaginal fluids of reproductive-age women and to characterize the H(2)O(2)-producing and N-9-resistant strains in an Argentine population. RESULTS: We identified Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. fermentum, L. gasseri, L. jensenii, L. casei subsp. casei, L. brevis and L. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii as the most frequent species. In this Argentine, South American population, 62% of women had H(2)O(2)-producing vaginal lactobacilli. We found a high number of sensitive strains. Sixty-two H(2)O(2)-producer strains were detected, 50 (80.6%) strains were sensitive to N-9 and 12 (19.4%) strains were resistant to the inhibitory effect of N-9. DISCUSSION: The vaginal microecologic findings are comparable to those found in other populations and suggest that (1) vaginal microecologic conditions are likely to be similar among Argentine women as in other countries, and (2) N-9 may have deleterious effects as in other populations.
TI  - Modulation of antibody-mediated immune response by probiotics in chickens.
AB  - Probiotic bacteria, including Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum, have been shown to enhance antibody responses in mammals. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of a probiotic product containing the above bacteria in addition to Streptococcus faecalis on the induction of the chicken antibody response to various antigens, both systemically and in the gut. The birds received probiotics via oral gavage and subsequently were immunized with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) to evaluate antibody responses in serum or with tetanus toxoid (TT) to measure the mucosal antibody response in gut contents. Control groups received phosphate-buffered saline. Overall, BSA and SRBC induced a detectable antibody response as early as week 1 postimmunization (p.i.), which lasted until week 3 p.i. Probiotic-treated birds had significantly (P <or= 0.001) more serum antibody (predominantly immunoglobulin M [IgM]) to SRBC than the birds that were not treated with probiotics. However, treatment with probiotics did not enhance the serum IgM and IgG antibody responses to BSA. Immunization with TT resulted in the presence of specific IgA and IgG antibody responses in the gut. Again, treatment with probiotics did not change the level or duration of the antibody response in the gut. In conclusion, probiotics enhance the systemic antibody response to some antigens in chickens, but it remains to be seen whether probiotics have an effect on the generation of the mucosal antibody response.
TI  - Lactobacillus johnsonii La1 attenuates Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis and reduces levels of proinflammatory chemokines in C57BL/6 mice.
AB  - In clinical settings, Lactobacillus johnsonii La1 administration has been reported to have a favorable effect on Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis, although the mechanism remains unclear. We administered, continuously through the water supply, live La1 to H. pylori-infected C57BL/6 mice and followed colonization, the development of H. pylori-associated gastritis in the lamina propria, and the levels of proinflammatory chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2) and keratinocyte-derived cytokine (KC) in the serum and gastric tissue over a period of 3 months. We documented a significant attenuation in both lymphocytic (P=0.038) and neutrophilic (P=0.003) inflammatory infiltration in the lamina propria as well as in the circulating levels of anti-H. pylori immunoglobulin G antibodies (P=0.003), although we did not observe a suppressive effect of La1 on H. pylori colonizing numbers. Other lactobacilli, such as L. amylovorus DCE 471 and L. acidophilus IBB 801, did not attenuate H. pylori-associated gastritis to the same extent. MIP-2 serum levels were distinctly reduced during the early stages of H. pylori infection in the La1-treated animals, as were gastric mucosal levels of MIP-2 and KC. Finally, we also observed a significant reduction (P=0.046) in H. pylori-induced interleukin-8 secretion by human adenocarcinoma AGS cells in vitro in the presence of neutralized (pH 6.8) La1 spent culture supernatants, without concomitant loss of H. pylori viability. These observations suggest that during the early infection stages, administration of La1 can attenuate H. pylori-induced gastritis in vivo, possibly by reducing proinflammatory chemotactic signals responsible for the recruitment of lymphocytes and neutrophils in the lamina propria.
TI  - Functional analysis of putative adhesion factors in Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM.
AB  - Lactobacilli are major inhabitants of the normal microflora of the gastrointestinal tract, and some select species have been used extensively as probiotic cultures. One potentially important property of these organisms is their ability to interact with epithelial cells in the intestinal tract, which may promote retention and host-bacterial communication. However, the mechanisms by which they attach to intestinal epithelial cells are unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate cell surface proteins in Lactobacillus acidophilus that may promote attachment to intestinal tissues. Using genome sequence data, predicted open reading frames were searched against known protein and protein motif databases to identify four proteins potentially involved in adhesion to epithelial cells. Homologous recombination was used to construct isogenic mutations in genes encoding a mucin-binding protein, a fibronectin-binding protein, a surface layer protein, and two streptococcal R28 homologs. The abilities of the mutants to adhere to intestinal epithelial cells were then evaluated in vitro. Each strain was screened on Caco-2 cells, which differentiate and express markers characteristic of normal small-intestine cells. A significant decrease in adhesion was observed in the fibronectin-binding protein mutant (76%) and the mucin-binding protein mutant (65%). A surface layer protein mutant also showed reduction in adhesion ability (84%), but the effect of this mutation is likely due to the loss of multiple surface proteins that may be embedded in the S-layer. This study demonstrated that multiple cell surface proteins in L. acidophilus NCFM can individually contribute to the organism's ability to attach to intestinal cells in vitro.
TI  - Influence of fermentation medium composition on physicochemical surface properties of Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - The effect of the simple and complex basic components of a fermentation medium on the surface properties of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCC2628 is studied by physicochemical methods, such as electrophoresis, interfacial adhesion, and X-ray photonelectron spectroscopy, and by transmission electron microscopy. Starting from an optimized complete medium, the effect of carbohydrates, peptones, and yeast extracts on the physicochemical properties of the cell wall is systematically investigated by consecutively omitting one of the principal components from the fermentation medium at the time. The physicochemical properties and structure of the bacterial cell wall remain largely unchanged if the carbohydrate content of the fermentation medium is strongly reduced, although the concentration of surface proteins increases slightly. Both peptone and yeast extract have a considerable influence on the bacterial cell wall, as witnessed by changes in surface charge, hydrophobicity, and the nitrogen-to-carbon ratio. Both zeta potential and the cell wall hydrophobicity show a positive correlation with the nitrogen-to-carbon ratio of the bacterial surfaces, indicative of the important role of surface proteins in the overall surface physical chemistry. The hydrophobicity of the cell wall, which is low for the cultures grown in the complete medium and in the absence of carbohydrates, becomes fairly high for the cultures grown in the medium without peptones and the medium without yeast extract. UV spectrophotometry and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis combined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry are used to analyze the effect of medium composition on LiCl-extractable cell wall proteins, confirming the major change in protein composition of the cell wall for the culture fermented in the medium without peptones. In particular, it is found that expression of the S-layer protein is dependent on the protein source of the fermentation medium.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of plasmid pLC494 isolated from human intestinal Lactobacillus casei: construction of an Escherichia coli-Lactobacillus shuttle vector.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of plasmid pLC494 isolated from Lactobacillus casei L-49 was determined. Plasmid pLC494 is an 8846-bp long circular molecule with a G+C content of 41.5%. Two putative open reading frames, ORF4 (282 amino acids) and ORF5 (169 amino acids), were identified as replication proteins A and B that revealed 100 and 99% similarity, respectively, with the replication proteins of plasmid pLA103 from Lactobacillus acidophilus TK8912. Upstream of ORF4 were the four repeat regions (three perfect 22-bp repeats and one imperfect motif), a putative ribosome binding site, a -10 region, and a -35 region. The shuttle vector pJLE4942 (5318 bp) was constructed using repA from pLC494, a multiple cloning site, ColE1 ori, the ori of gram-negative bacteria from vector pUC19, and the chloramphenicol resistance gene from pJIR418 as a selection marker. Transformation of several lactic acid bacteria with the vector pJLE4942 indicated that this vector might be useful as a genetic tool for the intestinal lactobacilli.
TI  - Effect of probiotics on intestinal mucosal immunity and ultrastructure of cecal tonsils of chickens.
AB  - Sixty chickens were randomly divided into two groups to determine the effect of oral administration of probiotics on the intestinal mucosal immune response and ultrastructure of cecal tonsils. The first group (control) was fed with a basic diet without antibiotic or probiotics. The second group was fed with the same diet as the control, except they received drinking water with probiotics (4 x 10(9) cfu per chicken and day) from posthatch to day 3 of age. The probiotic preparation was composed of Bacillus subtilis Bs964, Candida utilis BKM-Y74 and Lactobacillus acidophilus LH1F. Intestinal fluid, Peyer's Patch and cecal tonsils were taken at day 1, 4, 7, 10 and 18 after administration of probiotics. The results showed: (i) Compared to the control, probiotics enhanced the content of following items: immunglobulin (Ig)A in the intestinal fluid at day 7 (p < 0.01), the IgG-forming cells at day 10 (p < 0.05), IgM-forming cells in the Peyer's Patch at day 7 (p < 0.05), IgA-forming cells at day 7-10 (p < 0.05), IgG-forming cells at day 7 (p < 0.05) and IgM-forming cells in cecal tonsils diffuse area at day 4-7 (p < 0.05). (ii) T lymphocytes in cecal tonsils were enhanced at day 7 (p < 0.01) after orally fed with probiotics. (iii) The density of microvilli and length of cecal tonsils increased after probiotics were administrated at day 3. With chicken ageing, the efficiency of probiotics would decrease. These results suggested that probiotics enhance intestinal mucosal immunity of chicken at the early age.
TI  - Lactobacillus endocarditis: case report and review of cases reported since 1992.
AB  - Lactobacillus is a rare cause of endocarditis with only 78 reported cases in the  literature. We report a case of Lactobacillus endocarditis and review reported adult cases since the introduction of the Duke's criteria for endocarditis. An analysis is presented with a focus on outcomes. Mortality from reported cases of Lactobacillus endocarditis was found to have substantially improved since 1992. Surgical rates for persistent disease remain the same. Possible reasons for this improvement include better antibiotics, earlier recognition of cases, and more aggressive treatment regimens.
TI  - Preinoculation with the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus early in life effectively inhibits murine Citrobacter rodentium colitis.
AB  - Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is a common pathogen in infantile diarrhea, causing a characteristic histopathologic attaching and effacing (A/E) lesion in the intestinal mucosa. The mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium causes a similar A/E lesion in the murine intestine. Like EPEC, C. rodentium infection results in colonic crypt hyperplasia, goblet cell depletion, epithelial proliferation, and mucosal disruption. Using this murine model, we tested the hypothesis that preinoculation of murine gut with Lactobacillus acidophilus early in life can enhance host defense against enteric bacterial infection and attenuate bacteria-mediated colitis. Two-week old BALB/c mice were inoculated with L. acidophilus twice per week for 4 weeks before C. rodentium infection or concomitantly with the exposure to C. rodentium at 6-8 weeks of age. The probiotics were administered twice weekly thereafter. We observed that L. acidophilus inoculation in mice inhibits C. rodentium-induced colitis, which is associated with a decrease in C. rodentium colonization and translocation, an increase in its clearance, and a suppression of colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. Probiotic treatment also stimulates regulatory cytokine expression in the colon [transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), interleukin (IL)-10]. Preinoculation with L. acidophilus is more effective than concomitant use of probiotics in the induction of intestinal IgA secretion and in the downregulation of proinflammatory cytokine expression [tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-6, and IL-12]. These observations suggest that inoculation with probiotics can effectively prevent bacteria-induced colitis by limiting enteric bacteria infection and promoting mucosal protective regulatory immune responses. This study may have ramifications for prevention of infectious diarrhea in human infants and children, particularly in developing countries.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus expressing recombinant K99 adhesive fimbriae has an inhibitory effect on adhesion of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli.
AB  - The most common enteric colibacillosis in neonatal and newborns is caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli(ETEC). Colonization of ETEC in the small intestine is associated with adhesions using fimbriae, which is known as a specific adhesion factor and provides highly specific means for anchoring and prerequisite for an infectious agent. In the present study we have engineered Lactobacillus acidophilus to produce recombinant K99 fimbriae, which is used for the colonization to the intestine of pigs. The expression of K99 fimbrial protein was confirmed using SDS-PAGE, immunoblot and agglutination analyses. To evaluate a function of the K99 fimbrial protein, inhibition and competition tests were performed on pre-screened intestinal brush border from pigs. The tests showed that recombinant L. acidophilus, not control L. acidophilus, had a significant inhibitory effect to and competition against K99+ E. coli in a dose dependent manner. In conclusion, we demonstrated that recombinant K99 fimbriae producing L. acidophilus was able to prevent E. coli binding to intestinal brush border.
TI  - Nonsurgical management of partial adhesive small-bowel obstruction with oral therapy: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with partial adhesive small-bowel obstruction are usually managed conservatively, receiving intravenous hydration and nothing by mouth. Previous studies have suggested that this approach is associated with longer hospital stays and an increased risk of delayed surgery. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to see if combining standard conservative treatment with oral administration of a laxative, a digestant and a defoaming agent would reduce the frequency of subsequent surgical intervention and reduce the length of hospital stay. METHODS: We identified 144 consecutive patients admitted between February 2000 and July 2001 with adhesive partial small-bowel obstruction and randomly assigned 128 who met the inclusion criteria to either the control group (intravenous hydration, nasogastric-tube decompression and nothing by mouth) or the intervention group (intravenous hydration, nasogastric-tube decompression and oral therapy with magnesium oxide, Lactobacillus acidophilus and simethicone). The primary outcome measures were the number of patients whose obstruction was successfully treated without surgery and the length of hospital stay. We also monitored rates of complications and recurring obstructions. RESULTS: Of the 128 patients, 63 were in the control group and 65 in the intervention group; the mean ages were 54.4 (standard deviation [SD] 15.9) years and 53.9 (SD 16.3) years respectively. Most of the patients were male. More patients in the intervention group than in the control group had successful treatment without surgery (59 [91%] v. 48 [76%], p = 0.03; relative risk 1.19, 95% confidence interval 1.03-1.40). The mean hospital stay was significantly longer among patients in the control group than among those in the intervention group (4.2 [SD 2.7] v. 1.0 [SD 0.7] days, p < 0.001). The complication and recurrence rates did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. INTERPRETATION: Oral therapy with magnesium oxide, L. acidophilus and simethicone was effective in hastening the resolution of conservatively treated partial adhesive small-bowel obstruction and shortening the hospital stay.
TI  - Potential of functional strains, isolated from traditional Maasai milk, as starters for the production of fermented milks.
AB  - The purpose of this research was the evaluation of technological features and of  the ability of functional LAB strains with desirable sensory characteristics, to produce fermented milk. Eight strains of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus paracasei and Lactococcus lactis, isolated from Maasai traditional fermented milk in Kenya and previously tested for their probiotic properties, were selected for this investigation. Technological features such as growth kinetics in fresh heat-treated whole milk medium and survival in the final product during storage at 4 degrees C, were studied. The strains Lb. acidophilus BFE 6,059, Lb. paracasei BFE 5,264 and Lc. lactis BFE 6,049 showed the best potential and were thus selected for use as starter cultures in further trials with the objective to improve their technological performance and to optimise the sensory features of fermented milk obtained. The effects of fat (F), non-fat milk solids (S) and fermentation temperature (T), modulated according to a Central Composite Design, on fermentation rates and viability losses during refrigerated storage of the chosen starters, and on product texture parameters, were studied. From the data analysis, it was possible to select optimum conditions for enhancing positive sensory traits of final products and for improving the survival of these potentially probiotic cultures.
TI  - Survival curves for microbial species stored by freeze-drying.
AB  - The survival of a variety of species of microorganism following storage for up to 20 years has been analyzed. The organisms were freeze-dried, sealed in ampoules under vacuum (<1 Pa) and stored in the dark at 5 degrees C. The yeast that was tested, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, showed only 8% survival when recovered shortly after freeze-drying, but subsequent loss during storage was the least among all the tested microorganisms. The decrease in the logarithm of survival per year (log survival) was -0.010, which corresponds to a survival rate of 97.7% per year. The Gram-negative bacteria tested, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Enterobacter cloacae, showed 42.6, 33.5, and 50.8% survival shortly after freeze-drying, which was higher than the corresponding survival of S. cerevisiae, but the subsequent loss during storage was greater than S. cerevisiae, the log survival figures being -0.041, -0.058, and -0.073 per year. These values correspond to survival rates of 91.0, 87.5, and 84.5% each year. The Gram-positive bacteria tested, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Enteroccoccus faecium, showed 62.5 and 85.2% survival shortly after freeze-drying, which was even higher than that of the Gram-negative species, and these organisms also showed better survival during storage than Gram-negative bacteria; their log survival rates were -0.018 and -0.016 per year, which corresponded to survival rates of almost 96% per year. Comparison of these results with other published data for different drying conditions suggests that survival during storage is strongly influenced by the degree of vacuum under which the ampoules were sealed. The excellent survival after freeze-drying of each species might be attributable to the high level of desiccation and to sealing under vacuum.
TI  - Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei 8700:2 degrades inulin-type fructans exhibiting different degrees of polymerization.
AB  - Ten strains of lactobacilli were assessed for their capacity to degrade inulin-type fructans, which are well-known prebiotics. Both oligofructose and inulin were tested. The dairy isolate Lactobacillus acidophilus IBB 801 degraded only oligofructose. The human isolate Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei 8700:2 degraded oligofructose and long-chain inulin and grew rapidly on both energy sources. In both cases, fractions of different degrees of polymerization were fermented. Moreover, large and short fractions of oligofructose were degraded simultaneously. When L. paracasei subsp. paracasei 8700:2 grew on oligofructose-enriched inulin, oligofructose was preferentially metabolized. In all cases, lactic acid was the main metabolic end product. Significant amounts of acetic acid, formic acid, and ethanol were produced when long-chain inulin or oligofructose-enriched inulin was used as the sole energy source.
TI  - Inhibitory activity of glass-ionomer cements on cariogenic bacteria.
AB  - This study evaluated the antibacterial activity of the glass-ionomer cements Vitrebond (3M ESPE), Ketac Molar (3M ESPE) and Fuji IX (GC America) against S mutans, S sobrinus, L acidophilus and A viscosus, using the agar diffusion test. Inocula were obtained by the seed of indicators cultures in BHI broth incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 hours. Base layers containing 15 mL of BHI agar and 300 microL of each bacteria suspension were prepared in Petri dishes. Six wells measuring 4 mm in diameter were made in each plate and completely filled with one of the testing materials. A 0.2% chlorhexidine solution applied in round filter papers was used as control. Tests were performed 12 times for each material and bacteria strain. After incubation of the plates at 37 degrees C for 24 hours, the zones of bacterial growth inhibition around the wells were measured. Overall, the results showed the following sequence of antibacterial activity: Vitrebond (despite the activation mode) > 0.2% chlorhexidine > Ketac Molar > Fuji IX, according to Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney statistical tests. This study confirmed significant antibacterial activity for two conventional glass-ionomers and one resin-modified glass-ionomer material. The resin-modified glass-ionomer cement Vitrebond, regardless of the activation mode, presented the best antibacterial activity against S mutans and S sobrinus. The antibacterial activity against A viscosus for Vitrebond was similar to 0.2% chlorhexidine, while light activation reduced its antibacterial activity against L acidophilus.
TI  - Kinetic analysis of the antibacterial activity of probiotic lactobacilli towards  Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium reveals a role for lactic acid and other inhibitory compounds.
AB  - Six Lactobacillus strains including commercial probiotic ones (L. acidophilus IBB 801, L. amylovorus DCE 471, L. casei Shirota, L. johnsonii La1, L. plantarum ACA-DC 287 and L. rhamnosus GG) were investigated, through batch fermentations under controlled conditions, for their capacity to inhibit Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium SL1344. All lactobacilli displayed strong antibacterial activity toward this Gram-negative pathogen and significantly inhibited invasion of the pathogen into cultured human enterocyte-like Caco-2/TC7 cells. By studying the production kinetics of antibacterial activity and applying the appropriate acid and pH control samples during a killing assay, we were able to distinguish between the effect of lactic acid and other inhibitory compounds produced. The antibacterial activity of L. acidophilus IBB 801, L. amylovorus DCE 471, L. casei Shirota and L. rhamnosus GG was solely due to the production of lactic acid. The antibacterial activity of L. johnsonii La1 and L. plantarum ACA-DC 287 was due to the production of lactic acid and (an) unknown inhibitory substance(s). The latter was (were) only active in the presence of lactic acid. In addition, the lactic acid produced was responsible for significant inhibitory activity upon invasion of Salmonella into Caco-2/TC7 cells.
TI  - Kinetics of immunoglobulin G, M, A and IgG subclass responses in experimental intravaginal trichomoniasis: prominence of IgG1 response.
AB  - Trichomoniasis, the most common nonviral sexually transmitted disease, is caused  by infection with the protist Trichomonas vaginalis. The clinical spectrum varies from an asymptomatic state to mild, moderate or severe symptoms. However, the exact factors leading to varied symptomatology have not been well elucidated. The mouse is a useful experimental model for intravaginal trichomoniasis, for understanding the role of local immune responses in the pathogenesis and varied symptomatology of this disease. The present study reports anti-Trichomonas IgG, IgM, IgA and IgG subclass antibody responses on different post-infection days (3rd, 7th, 14th, 21st and 28th) in serum and vaginal washes of mice infected intravaginally with T. vaginalis isolates from 15 symptomatic and 15 asymptomatic women. Successful intravaginal infection was established by inoculating T. vaginalis in BALB/c mice pre-inoculated with Lactobacillus acidophilus and pretreated with oestradiol. A significant increase in parasite load was observed on the 14th post-infection day (p.i.d.) in mice inoculated with T. vaginalis isolates from symptomatic women as compared to asymptomatic women (P < 0.001), followed by reduction until the 28th p.i.d. (P < 0.05). A significant increase in specific IgG (P < 0.001) and in particular IgG1 (P < 0.001) and IgM (P < 0.01) responses was observed on the 14th p.i.d. in serum and vaginal washes of mice infected with T. vaginalis isolates from symptomatic women as compared to asymptomatic women. Significant increases in specific IgG, IgM and IgG1 responses was observed on the 14th p.i.d. in serum samples as compared with vaginal washes of mice infected with T. vaginalis isolates from symptomatic and asymptomatic women (P < 0.01), whereas no significant difference was observed in IgA, IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3 antibody responses. The study indicates that specific IgG, particularly IgG1 and IgM, may be playing a role in establishing symptomatic infection.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial and resistance-modifying activities of aqueous crude khat  extracts against oral microorganisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess antimicrobial activities of aqueous crude khat (Catha edulis) extracts against a panel of oral microorganisms and to test their ability to modify bacterial resistance to tetracycline and penicillin in vitro. DESIGN: Lyophilized aqueous extracts were prepared from three khat cultivars. The agar dilution method of the NCCLS was used to test the extracts, at concentrations of 20-1.25 mg/ml, against 33 oral strains. MIC was defined as the lowest concentration at which there was no visible growth. Slight growth was defined as marked growth reduction (MGR). The E-test was used to determine the MICs of tetracycline and penicillin-G for three resistant strains in absence and presence of a sub-MIC of the khat extracts (5mg/ml). RESULTS: Eighteen strains (55%) were sensitive to the extracts (MICs 5-20 mg/ml). Most of these were periodontal pathogens with Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythensis being the most susceptible (MIC 5-10mg/ml). Veillonella parvula, Actinomyces israelii and some streptococci were not sensitive. Except for Lactobacillus acidophilus that showed MGR at 1mg/ml, cariogenic species were neither sensitive. The extracts were active against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC 10-20 mg/ml) but not against Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus. The presence of the khat extracts at a sub-MIC resulted in a 2-4-fold potentiation of the tested antibiotics against the resistant strains. CONCLUSIONS: Khat has water-soluble constituents possessing selective antibacterial activity against oral bacteria. There is preliminary evidence for presence of an antibiotic resistance-modifying component. Further investigation is needed to identify the active components and assess their clinical relevance.
TI  - Experimental acute alcohol pancreatitis-related liver damage and endotoxemia: synbiotics but not metronidazole have a protective effect.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test the effect of gut manipulation by either novel synbiotics or by metronidazole on either endotoxemia or the severity of liver damage in the course of acute pancreatitis from alcohol ingestion. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were fed for 1 week through an intragastric tube a liquid diet with either: (i) 1 mL t.i.d. of a mixture of synbiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus and Bifidobacterium in an enriched medium); (ii) 20 mg/kg t.i.d. metronidazole; or (iii) standard diet. Then, acute pancreatitis was induced by caerulein and when the disease was full-blown, rats were fed an alcohol-rich diet. Synbiotic and metronidazole treatment was given for a further 2 weeks. Transaminase and endotoxemia levels were measured before treatment, after 6 h, after 24 h and 2 weeks later, at the time the rats were killed. Liver samples were obtained for histological analysis. RESULTS: Synbiotics but not metronidazole improved the acute pancreatitis-induced increase in endotoxemia and transaminase levels. The addition of alcohol worsened these variables to a limited extent in the synbiotic-treated group, while metronidazole had a negative effect on liver damage. CONCLUSIONS: Gut flora pretreatment with synbiotics was able to effectively protect against endotoxin/bacterial translocation, as well as liver damage in the course of acute pancreatitis and concomitant heavy alcohol consumption. The beneficial effect of synbiotics on liver histology seems to be correlated with endotoxemia. Metronidazole did not produce such a beneficial effect; in fact, it further worsened liver damage when alcohol was added to the background of ongoing acute pancreatic inflammation.
TI  - Production of Propionibacterium shermanii biomass and vitamin B12 on spent media.
AB  - AIMS: The propionibacteria are commercially important due to their use in the cheese industry, and there is a growing interest for their probiotic effects. Stimulatory effects of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on propionic acid bacteria have been observed. This study was designed to examine the possibility of using spent media previously used to grow LAB for the production of biomass and metabolites of Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii. METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventeen MRS and vegetable juice media were prefermented by various LAB and evaluated for their ability to subsequently support the growth of Propionibacterium, using automated spectrophotometry (AS). Growth of Propionibacterium in spent media was strongly affected by the LAB strain used to produce the spent medium. The native MRS medium (not prefermented) yielded the highest optical density values followed by prefermented media by Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium longum and Lactococcus lactis. Prefermented cabbage juice enabled good growth of Propionibacterium. For the production of organic acids and vitamin B12, cells of Propionibacterium were concentrated and immobilized in alginate beads in the aim of accelerating the bioconversions. More propionic acid was obtained in spent media than in native MRS. The concentration of vitamin B12 was higher in media fermented with free cells than those with immobilized cultures; with the free cells, its concentration varied from 900 to 1800 ng ml(-1) of media. CONCLUSIONS: It was demonstrated that spent media could be recycled for the production of Propionibacterium and metabolites, depending on the LAB strain that was previously grown. Media remediation is needed to improve the production of vitamin B12, especially with immobilized cells. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study presents an option for recycling of spent media generated by producers of LAB or producers of fermented vegetables. The propionic fermentation may result in three commercial products: biomass, vitamin B12 or organic acids, which may be used as starters, supplements or food preservatives. It is an attractive process from economical and environmental standpoints.
TI  - Oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. However, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. We aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative oral pathogens. METHODS: A total of 238 Lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. In all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis. Antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia was assessed. RESULTS: Lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. The most prevalent strains in healthy persons were Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, Lactobacillus plantarum. Obligately homofermentatives, particularly L. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for L. gasseri, P < 0.01). Sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited S. mutans, 88% A. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% P. gingivalis and 65% P. intermedia. The strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with Lactobacillus paracasei, L. plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Lactobacillus salivarius. The strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against S. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. CONCLUSION: The composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly L. gasseri, in the latter group. Both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.
TI  - Determination of nucleotide sequence related to the plasmid replication region in Enterococcus faecalis and its application to a new shuttle vector.
AB  - The 5.1-kb plasmid pAMalpha1delta2, a derivative of the 9.6-kb plasmid pAMalpha1  which is harbored by Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 14508, has a region necessary for replication in E. faecalis. The nucleotide sequence related to the replication region in pAMalpha1delta2 was determined and found to contain an open reading frame of 720-bp encoding a replication protein. The sequence showed 54.5 and 48.5% homology to those encoding the RepAs of plasmids pLA103 from Lactobacillus acidophilus and pFA3 from Neisseria gonorrhoeae, respectively. A recombinant 5.8-kb plasmid, pEFX6, which can be used as a shuttle vector between Escherichia coli and some strains of E. faecalis, was constructed by combining the tetracycline resistance gene of pAMalpha1delta2 and the replication regions of pAMalpha1delta2 and pUC18 for E. faecalis and E. coli, respectively. This shuttle vector was successfully used to clone and express the gelatinase gene from E. faecalis subsp. zymogenes IFO 3989 in E. faecalis C57, a strain showing no gelatinase activity.
TI  - Effects of yeasts and bacteria on the levels of folates in rye sourdoughs.
AB  - Fermentation of rye dough is often accompanied with an increase in folate content. In this study, three sourdough yeasts, Candida milleri CBS 8195, Saccharomyces cerevisiae TS 146, and Torulaspora delbrueckii TS 207; a control, baker's yeast S. cerevisiae ALKO 743; and four Lactobacillus spp., L. acidophilus TSB 262, L. brevis TSB 307, L. plantarum TSB 304, and L. sanfranciscensis TSB 299 originally isolated from rye sourdough were examined for their abilities to produce or consume folates. The microorganisms were grown in yeast extract-peptone-d-glucose medium as well as in small-scale fermentations that modelled the sourdough fermentation step used in rye baking. Total folate contents were determined using Lactobacillus rhamnosus (ATCC 7469) as the growth indicator organism. The microorganisms studied did not excrete folates into the media in significant amounts. Yeasts increased the folate contents of sterilised rye flour-water mixtures from 6.5 microg/100 g to between 15 and 23 microg/100 g after 19-h fermentation, whereas lactic acid bacteria decreased it to between 2.9 and 4.2 microg/100 g. Strains of Lactobacillus bulgaricus, L. casei, L. curvatus, L. fermentum, L. helveticus, Pediococcus spp., and Streptococcus thermophilus that were also tested gave folate contents after fermentation that varied between 2 and 10.4 microg/100 g. Although the four Lactobacillus spp. from sourdough consumed folates their effect on folate contents in co-cultivations was minimal. It was concluded that the increase of folate content during fermentation was mainly due to folate synthesis by yeasts. Fermentation of non-sterilised flour-water mixtures as such resulted in three-fold increases in the folate contents. Two folate producing bacteria were isolated from the non-sterilised flour and identified as Enterobacter cowanii and Pantoea agglomerans.
TI  - A Lactobacillus acidophilus strain of human gastrointestinal microbiota origin elicits killing of enterovirulent Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium by triggering lethal bacterial membrane damage.
AB  - The human gastrointestinal microbiota produces antagonistic activities against gastrointestinal bacterial pathogens. We undertook a study to investigate the mechanism(s) by which a Lactobacillus acidophilus strain of human microbiota origin antagonizes the gram-negative enteroinvasive pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. We showed that the cell-free culture supernatant of L. acidophilus strain LB (LB-CFCS) induced the following effects in S. enterica SL1344: (i) a decrease in intracellular ATP that paralleled bacterial death, (ii) the release of lipopolysaccharide, (iii) permeabilization of the bacterial membrane, and (iv) an increase in the sensitivity of Salmonella to the lytic action of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Finally, we showed using two mutant strains of Salmonella, PhoP MS7953s and PmrA JKS1170, that the two-component regulatory systems PhoP-PhoQ and PmrA-PmrB that regulate the mechanisms of resistance to antibacterial agents in Salmonella did not influence the anti-Salmonella effect of LB-CFCS.
TI  - Microarray analysis of a two-component regulatory system involved in acid resistance and proteolytic activity in Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Two-component regulatory systems are one primary mechanism for environmental sensing and signal transduction. Annotation of the complete genome sequence of the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM revealed nine two-component regulatory systems. In this study, the histidine protein kinase of a two-component regulatory system (LBA1524HPK-LBA1525RR), similar to the acid-related system lisRK from Listeria monocytogenes (P. D. Cotter et al., J. Bacteriol. 181:6840-6843, 1999), was insertionally inactivated. A whole-genome microarray containing 97.4% of the annotated genes of L. acidophilus was used to compare genome-wide patterns of transcription at various pHs between the control and the histidine protein kinase mutant. The expression pattern of approximately 80 genes was affected by the LBA1524HPK mutation. Putative LBA1525RR target loci included two oligopeptide-transport systems present in the L. acidophilus genome, other components of the proteolytic system, and a LuxS homolog, suspected of participating in synthesis of the AI-2 signaling compound. The mutant exhibited lower tolerance to acid and ethanol in logarithmic-phase cells and poor acidification rates in milk. Supplementation of milk with Casamino Acids essentially restored the acid-producing ability of the mutant, providing additional evidence for a role of this two component system in regulating proteolytic activity in L. acidophilus.
TI  - Effect of milk fermented with Lactobacillus acidophilus strain L-92 on symptoms of Japanese cedar pollen allergy: a randomized placebo-controlled trial.
AB  - A placebo-controlled, single-blind study was conducted to evaluate the effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus strain L-92 (L-92) on the symptoms of Japanese cedar-pollen allergy. This study was carried out during the 2002 and 2003 seasons of Japanese cedar pollination. Twenty-three in-house volunteers were asked to drink 100 ml of heat-treated milk fermented with L-92 containing 5 x 10(10) of the bacteria, twice a day, for 6 consecutive weeks. A similar study was carried out during the 2003 season for 10 weeks, but the daily dose of bacteria was 2 x 10(10). A significant improvement of the ocular symptom-medication score (SMS) was observed in 2002 and of the score of distress of life in 2003. These data show that a daily oral intake of not less than 2 x 10(10) heat-treated L-92 cells improved the symptoms of Japanese cedar pollinosis, thereby contributing to reduce the dose of concomitant medications. However, no blood parameter was significantly affected in these trials.
TI  - Evaluation of a diet containing probiotics and zinc for the treatment of mild diarrheal illness in children younger than one year of age.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Supplementation of probiotics and supplementation of zinc during acute gastroenteritis in children have been shown to exert positive effects on diarrhea duration and severity. Our aim was to evaluate a new diet enriched with zinc and probiotic bacteria in the treatment of acute gastroenteritis in young children. METHODS: In a double blind prospective study, 65 children aged 6-12 months were randomized to receive 6 x 10(9) colony forming units of Streptococcus thermophilus, Bifidobacterium lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus (2 x 10(9) of each strain), 10 mg of zinc/day, and 0.3 grams of fructo-oligosaccharides in the supplemented group (n = 33) or placebo (n = 32), given in a soy protein based rice cereal. For each child, age, sex, weight, degree of dehydration, the presence of fever or vomiting, stool frequency and consistency were recorded daily until diarrhea resolution. RESULTS: Diarrhea resolution occurred after 1.43 +/- 0.71 days in the supplemented group vs. 1.96 +/- 1.24 in the control group (p = 0.017). In the subset of children who presented with vomiting, time to vomiting resolution was 0.27 +/- 0.59 vs. 0.81 +/- 0.91 days in the supplemented and control groups, respectively (p = 0.06). On day 3, there was only 1 child with watery stools in the supplemented group versus 10 children in the control group (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In our series, the feeding of a cereal containing Streptococcus thermophilus, Bifidobacterium lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus and zinc, reduced the severity and duration of acute gastroenteritis in young children. However, whether this combination is better than either the addition of probiotics or zinc alone is yet to be determined.
TI  - [Antifungal effect in selected natural compounds and probiotics and their possible use in prophylaxis of vulvovaginitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: a survey of effective natural compounds and probiotics with antifungal activity and their possible use in vulvovaginitis as a prophylactic or therapeutic drug. DESIGN: review of literature. SETTING: Charles University at Prague, Pharmaceutical Faculty at Hradec Kralove. METHODS: and review of literature and publications from medical data-bases. CONCLUSIONS: certain natural compounds were proved to exert antimycotic effects. The efficiency of garlic extract under in vitro conditions against yeast of C. albicans family becomes manifest within one hour. Essential oils present in the Cayenne pepper (Capsodum frutescens) exert considerable antifungal activity against C. albicans as well. Clove exerts lower antimycotic effects. The effects of Chinese leek are similar to garlic. Propolis also possesses antifungal properties, and sensitivity of the yeast strains decreases in the following order: C. albicans > C. tropicalis > C. crusei > C. guilliermondii. Its efficiency depends on the composition and place of origin. Tea trea oil (Melalauca alternifolia) is inhibiting strains of Candida family (genus) in minimal inhibiting concentration, higher concentrations are necessary for C. crusei and C. norvengensis. In the prophylaxis of vaginal candidoses, oral administration of the strains of Lactobacilus rhamnosus GR-1 and L. fermentum RC-14, B-54 may be recommended. Moreover there are suitable strains of L. brevis CD-2, L. salivarius FV-2, L. gasseri MB 335, L. plantarum, useful in the form of gel capsules (L. plantarum) or vaginal tablets (L. gasseri). The strains of L. acidophilus CRL 1294 and L. salivarius CRL 1328 display the capacity of self aggregation and co-aggregation with Candida. It should be pointed out that the probiotic strain of Lactobacillus (especially L. casei and L. rhamnosus) may, in exceptional cases, cause bacteriemia and sepsis, especially in immunodeficient patients and those who underwent surgery of alimentary tract. No protective effect against yeast infection was detected with vitamin E, any positive effect was not unequivocally confirmed with zinc, but adjusting zinc levels to normal may be recommended.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of MDPB and fluoride in dentin bonding agents.
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare in vitro antibacterial activity of MDPB containing bonding system ABF with activities of three Fluoride containing bonding systems (Fuji Bond LC (FBLC), Prime&Bond NT (PBNT), and FluoroBond (FLB). Two bacterial strains were tested: Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus. The study was performed on Muller Hinton Agar by Agar Well Technique. The bacterial agar was evenly distributed over the surface of petri dishes. Standard wells were punched into the agar. The test materials were placed in the wells of Muller Hinton agar plates, inoculated with Streptococcus mutans NCTC10449 and Lactobacillus acidophilus. The diameters of inhibition zones produced around the materials were measured after 24 h of incubation at 37 +/- 1 degrees C. For statistical analysis, Duncan's multiple range test was used. The primers of bonding agents were highly effective against to Streptococcus mutans. The MDPB containing primer of ABF Bond produced the greatest inhibition zones against to Lactobacillus acidophilus. It was followed by FLB primer. Lactobacillus acidophilus was resistant to FBLC primer and bonding, ABF, PBNT and FLB bonding agents. The results of this study indicated that, incorporation of MDPB in primer of self-etch system increased its antibacterial activity especially against to Lactobacillus acidophilus. However, all bonding systems except for bonding agent of ABF showed some antibacterial activity against to Streptococcus mutans.
TI  - The effects of Lactobacillus-fermented milk on lipid metabolism in hamsters fed on high-cholesterol diet.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of local Lactobacillus strains (NTU 101 and 102) on cholesterol-lowering effects in vivo. Thirty male hamsters were housed, divided into five groups, and fed on a cholesterol diet (5 g/kg diet) to induce hypercholesterolemia. Milk fermented by Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei NTU 101, Lactobacillus plantarum NTU 102, and Lactobacillus acidophilus BCRC 17010 was administrated for this study. After treatment with different fermented milk, blood was taken and liver was removed for the determination of lipoproteins, including total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglyceride. Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria decreased (10(5)) in the control group; when hamsters were fed on fermented milk, the number of lactobacilli (10(7)-10(8)) and bifidobacteria (10(5)-10(7)) was increased. Serum and liver total cholesterol levels were significantly reduced by about 26.4, 23.5, and 30.1% and by about 17.7, 15.9, and 13.4% when hamsters were given fermented milk. However, serum HDL-C and LDL-C were also reduced. The results of this study showed that the hypocholesterolemic effect of local Lactobacillus strains was attributed to its ability to lower serum and liver total cholesterol levels. Thus, local Lactobacillus strains could significantly increase probiotic count.
TI  - Caseinoglycomacropeptide inhibits adhesion of pathogenic Escherichia coli strains to human cells in culture.
AB  - Caseinoglycomacropeptide (CGMP) derived from kappa-casein was investigated for its ability to inhibit the adhesion of 3 strains of verotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC) and 3 strains of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) to human HT29 tissue cell cultures. Effects on adhesion of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, Lactobacillus pentosus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus gasseri were also investigated. Generally, CGMP exerted effective anti-adhesive properties at a dose of 2.5 mg/mL, albeit with a high degree of strain specificity. The CGMP reduced adhesion of VTEC strains to <50% of the control and reduced adhesion of EPEC strains to between 80 and 10% of the control. The CGMP also reduced the adhesion of L. pentosus and L. casei to 44 and 42%, respectively. A slight but significant reduction of L. acidophilus, to 81%, was observed, but no significant effects were detected with either Dsv. desulfuricans or L. gasseri. Further investigation of the dose response relationships with the E. coli strains gave IC50 values ranging between 0.12 and 1.06 mg/mL.
TI  - Production of organic acids from fermentation of mannitol, fructooligosaccharide  and inulin by a cholesterol removing Lactobacillus acidophilus strain.
AB  - AIMS: Assessment of individual production of organic acids by Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4962 in the presence of mannitol, fructooligosaccharide (FOS) and inulin. METHODS AND RESULTS: The production patterns of individual organic acids by L. acidophilus ATCC 4962 were assessed using the experimental region for optimum cholesterol removal from the interaction between L. acidophilus ATCC 4962 and prebiotics selected in our previous study. The production of acetic and formic acids was growth associated and was greatly influenced by the inoculum size of the organism and the concentration of mannitol. The growth of the organism was repressed with the fermentation end products of FOS and inulin, which subsequently exhibited repressed production of acetic and formic acids as well. The inoculum size, mannitol and FOS linearly affected the formation of butyric acid and the response surface generated showed a correlation between butyric acid and acetic acid. The experimental regions with increased production of lactic acid showed cessation of growth of the organism, indicating inhibition of growth at high concentration of lactic acid. CONCLUSIONS: The production of individual organic acids was dependent on growth and the fermentability of prebiotics. Mannitol, FOS and inulin favoured the production of formic, lactic and butyric acids respectively. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The fermentability of prebiotics to produce metabolites has been a controversial issue. Information gathered in this study provides a better understanding on the production of organic acids from fermentation of mannitol, FOS and inulin by L. acidophilus ATCC 4962, and on changes in their production as a response from interaction of factors.
TI  - Bifidobacterium-selective isolation and enumeration from chicken caeca by a modified oligosaccharide antibiotic-selective agar medium.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the efficacy and selectivity of an acidified, antibiotic-selective, oligosaccharide-containing media for enumerating Bifidobacterium spp. from chicken caeca samples. METHODS AND RESULTS: Transoligosaccharide propionate agar medium (TOS) modified by addition of mupirocin (50 microg ml-1) and glacial acetic acid (1%, v/v), did not inhibit the growth of bifidobacteria compared with the control media yet inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus gallinarum, Lactobacillus helveticus and Streptococcus gordonii. CONCLUSIONS: Addition of mupirocin (50 microg ml-1) and glacial acetic acid (1%, v/v) to TOS (TOS-AM50), is an effective selective medium for isolation and enumeration of Bifidobacterium spp. from chicken caeca samples. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The development of an intestinal bifidobacteria-selective media contributes to the study of probiotics and prebiotics in poultry and potentially other species.
TI  - Rapid identification of Lactobacillus acidophilus by restriction analysis of the  16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region and flanking 23S rRNA gene.
AB  - A rapid molecular approach was developed for the initial identification of Lactobacillus acidophilus strains which are difficult to identify using a single biochemical test. The 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer regions and flanking 23S rRNA genes of 19 strains of lactobacilli were amplified and the nucleotide sequences and restriction site polymorphisms were analyzed. AluI was the most useful of the restriction enzymes analyzed and produced reproducible digestion profiles in the L. helveticus, L. plantarum, and L. casei groups, as well as in L. acidophilus. This restriction fragment length polymorphism method may be useful for the identification of L. acidophilus strains in dairy products.
TI  - Effect of probiotic supplementation on bacterial translocation in thermal injury.
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the effects of probiotic supplementation and enteral solutions containing glutamine and arginine on bacterial translocation (BT) and intestinal villous atrophy in thermal injury. METHODS: Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200-250 g were divided into four groups of ten. Group 1 served as control group without thermal injury and was fed standard chow. Thermal injury was inflicted as a 30% scald burn in the other three groups. Group 2 was fed standard chow and group 3 was fed standard chow supplemented with a probiotic (Acidophilus plus) containing Bifidobacterium bifidum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus bulgaricus (2 x 10(9) CFU/day) via an orogastric tube. Group 4 was fed only an enteral diet (Stresson multifiber) containing glutamine, arginine, and medium chain triglyceride, at 1 g/kg per day amino acid and 230 kcal/kg, for 7 days before thermal injury. All the animals were killed 24 h after thermal injury, and ileal segments were resected and examined histopathologically. To evaluate BT, samples from blood, mesenteric lymph nodes, and cecal content were cultured under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Terminal ileum specimens were histologically examined to evaluate mucosal integrity. RESULTS: Significantly less BT was seen in groups 3 and 4 than in group 2 (P < 0.001). No significant difference was found between groups 3 and 4. Histological evaluation showed significant reduction in villous atrophy in groups 3 and 4. CONCLUSION: Probiotic supplementation seems to reduce bacterial translocation and decrease intestinal mucosal atrophy in rats with thermal injury, as do enteral solutions with arginine and glutamine.
TI  - [Inhibitory activity of vaginal Lactobacillus bacteria on yeasts causing vulvovaginal candidiasis].
AB  - Growing frequency of therapeutical failures of vulvovaginal candidiasis, resulting from resistance of certain species of Candida to imidazole agents, raises interest in the use of probiotics from Lactobacillus genera as prophylaxis. Unfortunately, little is known about inhibitory mechanisms of Lactobacillus on Candida. The aim of this study was to compare the activity of selected Lactobacillus species, representing the physiological vaginal flora, against Candida as well as investigation whether their inhibitory activity against Candida is related strictly to hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid production. 125 strains from vaginal smears of healthy women were classified by making use of phenotypic and genotypic methods. The majority of strains belonged to L. acidophilus: L. acidophilus sensu stricto, L. crispatus, L. gasseri and L. johnsonii as well as L. fermentum and L. plantarum species. Culture supernatants of selected 25 strains representing the isolated species were examined for their inhibitory activity against the growth of Candida albicans and C. glabrata. The results showed that the strongest and the fastest activity against C. albicans was demonstrated by L. delbrueckii strains, producing the largest quantities of hydrogen peroxide. On the other hand, extended activity, demonstrable after 24 hours, was shown by non-H2O2 producing L. plantarum supernatants. Growth of C. glabrata was not inhibited by any of the examined strains of Lactobacillus. Comparison of activity of live active cultures of Lactobacillus strains and their mixtures with this of pure H2O2 and lactic acid has shown that pure chemical compounds were less active than the cultures. This suggests that mixtures of Lactobacillus strains are in cooperation with each other using many different metabolites.
TI  - Effect of some pharmaceutical excipients on the survival of probiotic vaginal lactobacilli.
AB  - Lactobacilli are the predominant microorganisms of the vaginal bacterial microbiota, and they play a major role in the maintenance of a healthy urogenital tract. In consequence, the interest in their potential use as probiotics has significantly increased during the last decade. In the present study we assessed the influence of different excipients on the survival of 4 probiotic vaginal lactobacilli incorporated into glycerinated gelatin ovules and stored at 5 degrees C for 60 d. Results showed that viability after storage was a strain-dependent characteristic, but inclusion of ascorbic acid significantly increased survival in 3 of the 4 strains tested. The best survival was observed for Lactobacillus salivarius CRL 1328 in ovules containing skimmed milk. No significant differences in viability were observed between control ovules (glycerogelatin base without excipients) and those containing lactose or Tween 80 for any of the strains tested. Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 1259 and Lactobacillus crispatus CRL 1266 were, respectively, the most resistant and sensitive strains to the storage with the different substances. In conclusion, these results provide a basis for selecting excipients to improve the survival of lactobacilli in a probiotic product, in an attempt to ensure the delivery of an adequate number of viable cells to the urogenital tract.
TI  - Enumeration of specific bacterial populations in complex intestinal communities using quantitative PCR based on the chaperonin-60 target.
AB  - We used qPCR and the target gene chaperonin-60 (cpn60) to enumerate Clostridium perfringens genomes in DNA extracts from contents of the chicken gastrointestinal tract with the aim of optimizing this methodology to enumerate any bacterium of interest. To determine the most accurate protocols for determining target species abundance, we compared various DNA extraction methods in combination with four methods for producing standard curves. Factors affecting accuracy included the co-purification of PCR inhibitors and/or fluorescence quenchers and the yield of target DNA in the extract. Anion exchange chromatography of the spiked test samples enabled accurate enumeration of C. perfringens using a standard curve comprised of a plasmid containing a fragment of C. perfringens cpn60. We used qPCR to enumerate C. perfringens and other intestinal bacteria in ileum and cecum samples from chickens that had been challenged with C. perfringens and compared the results with viable counts on corresponding selective agars. We conclude that qPCR-based molecular enumeration of target species in the gastrointestinal tract is feasible, but care must be taken in order to mitigate the effects of confounding factors that can affect the apparent cell count.
TI  - Extracellular homopolysaccharides and oligosaccharides from intestinal lactobacilli.
AB  - AIMS: To characterize lactobacilli isolated from the intestines of ducks or pigs  with respect to the production of extracellular homopolysaccharides (HoPS) and oligosaccharides. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lactobacillus strains of duck or pig origin were screened for HoPS synthesis and >25% of the isolates produced fructans or glucans from sucrose. Glucan-forming strains were found within the species Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus animalis and fructan-forming strains were found within Lactobacillus mucosae, Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus acidophilus. The glucan-forming strains of L. reuteri but not L. animalis produced glucose-oligosaccharides in additon to the respective polymers, and two fructan-forming strains of L. acidophilus produced kestose. Genes coding for glycosyltransferases were detected by PCR and partially characterized by sequence analysis. CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of lactobacilli from intestinal habitats produce HoPS from sucrose and polysaccharide formation is generally associated with the formation of glucose- and fructose oligosaccharides. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The characterization of the metabolic potential of intestinal lactobacilli contributes to the understanding of the molecular basis of autochthony in intestinal habitats. Moreover, this is the first report of glucose-oligosaccharide production during growth of lactobacilli, and one novel fructosyltransferase and one novel glucansucrase were partially characterized on the genetic level.
TI  - Use of a probiotic to decrease enteric hyperoxaluria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease have a 10- to 100-fold increased risk of nephrolithiasis, with enteric hyperoxaluria being the major risk factor for these and other patients with fat malabsorptive states. Endogenous components of the intestinal microflora can potentially limit dietary oxalate absorption. METHODS: Ten patients were studied with chronic fat malabsorption, calcium oxalate stones, and hyperoxaluria thought to be caused by jejunoileal bypass (1) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery for obesity (4), dumping syndrome secondary to gastrectomy (2), celiac sprue (1), chronic pancreatitis (1), and ulcerative colitis in remission (1). For 3 months, patients received increasing doses of a lactic acid bacteria mixture (Oxadrop), VSL Pharmaceuticals), followed by a washout month. Twenty-four-hour urine collections were performed at baseline and after each month. RESULTS: Mean urinary oxalate excretion fell by 19% after 1 month (1 dose per day, P < 0.05), and oxalate excretion remained reduced by 24% during the second month (2 doses per day, P < 0.05). During the third month on 3 doses per day oxalate excretion increased slightly, so that the mean was close to the baseline established off treatment. Urinary oxalate again fell 20% from baseline during the washout period. Calcium oxalate supersaturation was reduced while on Oxadrop, largely due to the decrease in oxalate excretion, although mean changes did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Manipulation of gastrointestinal (GI) flora can influence urinary oxalate excretion to reduce urinary supersaturation levels. These changes could have a salutary effect on stone formation rates. Further studies will be needed to establish the optimal dosing regimen.
TI  - Carbon dioxide stimulates the production of amylovorin L by Lactobacillus amylovorus DCE 471, while enhanced aeration causes biphasic kinetics of growth and bacteriocin production.
AB  - The effects of both oxygen and carbon dioxide on growth of and product formation  by Lactobacillus amylovorus DCE 471, a promising new sourdough starter culture, were assessed through controlled, in vitro fermentation experiments, using a temperature of 37 degrees C and a constant pH of 5.4. It was seen that aeration affected both cell growth and amylovorin L production. At aeration rates of 1 l min(-1) and more, the bacterial population was subjected to oxidative stress as reflected by biphasic growth patterns. During the first growth phase, the maximum specific growth rate increased with increasing aeration rates stabilizing at the highest oxygen concentrations. The maximum obtainable cell yields decreased. During the second growth phase, the amylovorin L production was stimulated at the highest aeration. However, amylovorin titers were never higher in the presence of oxygen compared with the anaerobic fermentations. Carbon dioxide did not influence cell growth of L. amylovorus DCE 471. The maximum specific growth rate and the biomass concentrations were merely affected. On the other hand, the maximum soluble bacteriocin titers coincided with the highest carbon dioxide flow rates. These results indicate that mild aeration of type II sourdoughs might enhance both cell yield and amylovorin L production by L. amylovorus DCE 471, thereby contributing to the competitiveness of the strain. Growth in an ecosystem together with yeasts producing carbon dioxide might exert a positive effect on the production of amylovorin L as well.
TI  - Susceptibility to some antifungal drugs of vaginal lactobacilli isolated from healthy women.
AB  - Samples were taken from the lateral vaginal wall of 19 healthy women. Lactobacilli were isolated from ten of these women. Fifty-eight Lactobacillus isolates were identified as L. gasseri, L. vaginalis, L. acidophilus, L. delbrueckii spp. lactis, L. crispatus, L. plantarum, L. cellobiosus, L. jensenii, L. salivarius, L. curvatus, L. brevis and L. oris. The inhibitory effect of isoconazole and oxiconazole in 0.2, 0.1 and 0.05 microg/ml concentrations on 58 Lactobacillus spp. and Candida albicans (AJD 180) were investigated, using an agar diffusion method. Although both antifungal drugs showed a large inhibitory effect on C. albicans, oxiconazole had a very low inhibitory effect on Lactobacillus isolates. The natural resistance of lactobacilli to anti-fungal drugs may enable the development of an antifungal drug(s)/ probiotic combination for antifungal activity and lactobacilli replacement therapy.
TI  - Anaerobic induction of adherence to laminin in Lactobacillus gasseri strains by contact with solid surface.
AB  - The effect of growth conditions on adhesion was studied in six species belonging  to Lactobacillus acidophilus homology groups. Namely, 17 strains including 6 fresh isolates of L. gasseri from human feces were assessed for their adherence to immobilized fibronectin, laminin, and type IV collagen. These extracellular matrix proteins were used as a model of damaged intestinal mucosa. When the bacteria were grown on MRS agar under anaerobic conditions, all eight L. gasseri strains and one L. johnsonii strain showed strong adhesiveness to laminin, but not when grown in static MRS broth. A similar pattern was observed in four L. gasseri strains in terms of adherence to fibronectin. No L. gasseri or L. johnsonii strains exhibited adhesion to type IV collagen under either growth condition. Adhesion of L. acidophilus, L. crispatus, L. amylovorus, and L. gallinarum was not affected by the growth conditions. Although protease treatment of L. gasseri cells abolished the adhesion, periodate oxidation of the cells increased it except in one strain. The adherence of L. gasseri cells was diminished by periodate and alpha-mannosidase treatments of immobilized laminin. The above results suggest that mannose-specific proteinaceous adhesion can be induced in L. gasseri by contact with a mucosal surface in the anaerobic intestinal lumen.
TI  - Genetic analysis of two bile salt hydrolase activities in Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM.
AB  - Two genes, bshA and bshB, encoding bile salt hydrolase enzymes (EC 3.5.1.24) were identified in the genome sequence of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM. Targeted inactivation of these genes via chromosomal insertion of an integration vector demonstrated different substrate specificities for these two enzymes.
TI  - Influence of controlled lactic fermentation on growth and sporulation of Bacillus cereus in milk.
AB  - The growth and sporulation of Bacillus cereus NVH 45 in a fermentor with controlled pH or simulated pH conditions were investigated. The study was carried out in a fermentor to measure the influence of a rapid and a slow lactic acid production on the inhibition of B. cereus in a controlled environment during the initial part of fermentation and to observe if other factors than lactic acid influenced the inhibition. In the controlled pH experiments the pH was allowed to decrease to an end pH 5.0, 5.5 or 6.0 either by Lactobacillus casei 2756 (a fast acid producer) or Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFB 1748 (a slow acid producer). In co-cultures of Lb. casei 2756 and B. cereus NVH 45, low numbers (10-70 cfu/ml) of B. cereus NVH 45 were observed at end pH 5.5 (72 h) while at pH 5.0 no viable cells (<10 cfu/ml) were detected (48-72 h). B. cereus NVH 45 did not sporulate in co-culture with Lb. casei 2756. In co-culture with Lb. acidophilus NCFB 1748, B. cereus NVH 45 sporulated and survived as spores. In these co-cultures B. cereus NVH 45 grew to higher maximum counts (>10(7) cfu/ml) than with Lb. casei 2756 (<10(7) cfu/ml). Significantly different amounts of lactic acid were observed between the two co-cultures after 7 and 12 h. A rapid decrease of pH appears to prevent B. cereus from sporulating and it seems that it is enough to just reach pH 5.0 rapidly and keep that pH to achieve the desirable inhibition of B. cereus. In the simulated pH experiments B. cereus NVH 45 was inoculated in the fermentor and the different pH developments from different LAB strains were monitored by addition of lactic acid. These experiments showed the same tendency: a fast pH reduction during the initial hours of fermentation, simulating lactococci, resulted in complete inhibition of B. cereus NVH 45 (<10 cfu/ml). However, when simulating the pH development of the two different Lactobacillus strains, complete inhibition of B. cereus NVH 45 was not seen. In co-cultures competition for nutrients with consequences for cell density appears to be important. Based on these results it seems that B. cereus must reach a certain density to induce sporulation.
TI  - Effect of culture conditions on production of butter flavor compounds by Pediococcus pentosaceus and Lactobacillus acidophilus in semisolid maize-based cultures.
AB  - Two series of 120 h mixed cultures of Pediococcus pentosaceus MITJ-10 and Lactobacillus acidophilus Hansen 1748 were grown in semisolid maize-based media, applying an orthogonal factorial design in order to establish the most adequate parameters to get compounds related to butter-like flavor. Conditions of maize pre-treatment established in the first series were hot lime-treatment for 20 min, grinding and sieving to 0.0165 in., partial defatting and cooking for 25 min. While the culture conditions established for the second series were the addition of yeast extract (0.2% w/w), and culture starting with 2x10(6) CFU g(-1) and a ratio of P. pentosaceus and L. acidophilus, 3:1. The fermentation profile was studied in a last culture. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) prevailed over the native microorganisms, with a specific growth rate of 0.47 h(-1). Diacetyl production correlated (r2=0.9972) with the 12 h exponential growth phase of LAB. The concentration of diacetyl at that time was 779.56 mg kg(-1). The contents of lactic acid and volatile fatty acids were low at 12 h, 665 and 1312 mg kg(-1), respectively. During the long stationary phase, they increased up to 4800 and 1886 mg kg(-1), respectively. This procedure might be useful to prepare naturally aromatized raw materials for the food industry.
TI  - The use of probiotics in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: two case reports.
AB  
TI  - Probiotics reduce enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7- and enteropathogenic E. coli O127:H6-induced changes in polarized T84 epithelial cell monolayers by reducing bacterial adhesion and cytoskeletal rearrangements.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine if probiotics reduce epithelial injury following exposure to Escherichia coli O157:H7 and E. coli O127:H6. The pretreatment of intestinal (T84) cells with lactic acid-producing bacteria reduced the pathogen-induced drop in transepithelial electrical resistance. These findings demonstrate that probiotics prevent epithelial injury induced by attaching-effacing bacteria.
TI  - CVV in women with HIV.
AB  
TI  - The effect of probiotics on the genotoxicity of furazolidone.
AB  - Antigenotoxic activity of probiotic bacteria against furazolidone was studied using the short-term bacterial assay SOS chromotest, with Escherichia coli PQ37 as the test organism. The supernatants from probiotic and furazolidone co-incubation exhibited rather strong suppression on SOS induction produced by furazolidone on E. coli PQ 37 (sfiA: lacZ). Genotoxicity inhibition was found for all strains of the examined bacteria belonging to three genera. The highest genotoxicity inhibition was detected for Bifidobacterium lactis Bb-12 (92.0%) and for Lactobacillus acidophilus T20 (81.9%).
TI  - Lactobacilli in the intestinal microbiota of Swedish infants.
AB  - Lactobacillus colonisation was examined in 112 Swedish infants. Faecal samples obtained at 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks and at 6, 12 and 18 months of age were cultivated quantitatively on Rogosa agar. Lactobacilli were speciated by PCR and typed to the strain level by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Lactobacilli reached a peak at 6 months when 45% of the infants were colonised. L. rhamnosus and L. gasseri were the most common species in this period. Colonisation by lactobacilli in general (P < 0.01) and L. rhamnosus in particular (P < 0.05) was more common in breast-fed than in weaned infants at 6 months of age. Lactobacillus isolation reached a nadir of 17% by 12 months (P < 0.0001), but increased to 31% by 18 months of age P < 0.05). The food-related species L. paracasei, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus and L. delbrueckii dominated in this second phase. A single strain persisted for at least 3 weeks in 17% of the infants during the first 6 months, most commonly L. rhamnosus. Lactobacillus population counts in colonised infants increased from 10(6.4) cfu/g at 1 week to 10(8.8) cfu/g at 6 months, and then dropped to 10(5.4) cfu/g faeces at 12 months of age. Lactobacillus colonisation was not significantly related to delivery mode, or to presence of siblings or pets in the household. Our results suggest that certain Lactobacillus species, especially L. rhamnosus, thrive in the intestinal flora of breast-fed infants. After weaning they are replaced by other Lactobacillus species of types found in food.
TI  - Plasmid profiling and curing of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of chicken.
AB  - In this study, we assessed the susceptibility of 12 Lactobacillus strains, all of which had been isolated from the gastrointestinal tracts of chicken, to three antibiotics (chloramphenicol, erythromycin and tetracycline) used commonly as selective markers in transformation studies of lactic acid bacteria. Among these strains, 17%, 58%, and 25% were found to exhibit a high degree of resistance to 200 microg/ml of tetracycline, erythromycin, and chloramphenicol, respectively. Seven of the 12 Lactobacillus strains exhibiting resistance to at least 50 microg/ml of chloramphenicol or erythromycin, and five strains exhibiting resistance to at least 50 microg/ml of tetracycline, were subsequently subjected to plasmid curing with chemical curing agents, such as novobiocin, acriflavin, SDS, and ethidium bromide. In no cases did the antibiotic resistance of these strains prove to be curable, with the exception of the erythromycin resistance exhibited by five Lactobacillus strains (L. acidophilus I16 and I26, L. fermentum I24 and C17, and L. brevis C10). Analysis of the plasmid profiles of these five cured derivatives revealed that all of the derivatives, except for L. acidophilus I16, possessed profiles similar to those of wild-type strains. The curing of L. acidophilus I16 was accompanied by the loss of 4.4 kb, 6.1 kb, and 11.5 kb plasmids.
TI  - Probiotics and necrotizing enterocolitis.
AB  
TI  - Culture supernatant of Lactobacillus acidophilus stimulates proliferation of embryonic cells.
AB  - Our previous report showed that supernatants of Lactobacillus acidophilus (LS) cultures possessed chemotactic and angiogenic properties. Specifically, LS stimulated gene expression and the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), the proliferation of immune cells in vitro, and blood vessel formation. Chemotaxis and proliferation of inflammatory cells in vivo were also stimulated by LS. In the current study, we hypothesized that LS stimulates the growth and development of other rapidly dividing cells, including embryonic cells. The stimulatory effects of LS on a neuroblastoma cell line (Neuro-2a), chicken embryos, and bovine embryos were examined. The addition of LS to Neuro-2a cultures caused a proliferation of cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Pretreatment of LS at 56 degrees C for 30 mins did not affect its stimulatory activity. The administration of LS to the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of chicken-embryonated eggs for 1-2 days resulted in extensive thickening of the membrane. The thickening was due to the influx and proliferation of fibroblasts and inflammatory cells, the accumulation of loose connective tissue composed primarily of mucopolysaccharides, and/or the formation of blood vessels. Stimulatory effects of LS on bovine embryos were also observed. The treatment with LS significantly promoted the development of zygotes to the four-cell stage and from the four-cell stage to blastocysts. These results have confirmed our hypothesis that LS exerts a stimulatory effect on the cells of embryonic stages including neuroblastoma cells, the CAM of chicken embryos, and bovine embryos from zygotes to blastocysts.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and tightness of a DCPD-CaO-based hydraulic calcium phosphate cement for root canal filling.
AB  - Calcium hydroxide is currently used in dentistry for endodontic treatments where  its main advantage is its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity. However, it also has some drawbacks such as pulp necrosis, slight solubility, slow and insufficient hardening, and retraction on drying. In consequence, it is used only as temporary material for root canal disinfection. By mixing calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (CaHPO4 . 2H2O, also called dicalcium phosphate dihydrate, DCPD) and calcium oxide with a sodium phosphate buffer as liquid phase, we obtained a CPC with better mechanical properties than calcium hydroxide pastes. The setting reaction produced either hydroxyapatite (HA) or a mixture of HA and calcium hydroxide depending on the relative masses of DCPD and CaO in the cement powder. The presence of calcium hydroxide a priori confers antimicrobial properties to this cement which were investigated in agar plates (diffusion method) against Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus hominis (clinical isolates), and a preparation of polymicrobial flora isolated from dental plaque. The cement samples tested were prepared at molar calcium-to-phosphate ratios (Ca/P) of 1.67 to 2.75. A pure calcium hydroxide paste was used as reference material. Clear and reproducible bacterial growth inhibition was observed for cement samples with Ca/P > or = 2 against all the microorganisms tested. With Ca/P = 2.5, this cement alkalinizes dentinal tubules and provides a fluid-tight sealing that well compares with sealing obtained using a zinc oxide-eugenol cement without gutta-percha point. DCPD-CaO-based cement is therefore a potential root canal filler.
TI  - Salivary Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 and Lactobacillus casei levels predict pregnancy outcomes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gravida's poor periodontal health is emerging as a modifiable independent risk factor for preterm delivery and low birth weight. METHODS: To test the hypothesis that oral bacteria other than periodontal pathogens are also associated with pregnancy outcomes, specific oral bacterial levels measured during pregnancy were evaluated in relation to gestational age and birth weight while controlling for demographic, medical, and dental variables. The study population consisted of 297 predominantly African- American women who were pregnant for the first time. The salivary bacterial levels evaluated were Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus sanguinus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies (gsp) 1 and 2, total streptococci, and total cultivable organisms. RESULTS: For 1 unit increase in log(10) A. naeslundii gsp 2 levels, there was a 60 gm decrease in birth weight (beta = -59.7 g; SE = 29.1; P = 0.04), and a 0.17 week decrease in gestational age (beta = -0.17 wk; SE = 0.09; P = 0.05). In contrast, per 1 unit increase in log(10) L. casei levels, there was a 42 gm increase in birth weight (beta = 42.2 g; SE = 19.3; P = 0.03), and a 0.13 week increase in gestational age (beta = 0.13 week; SE = 0.06; P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that other oral bacterial species can also be related to pregnancy outcomes in addition to previously reported periodontal pathogens. These organism levels may not only predict poor pregnancy outcomes, but also be used as modifiable risk factors in reducing prematurity and low birth weight.
TI  - Optimization of technical conditions for the transformation of Lactobacillus acidophilus strains by electroporation.
AB  - AIMS: To optimize the conditions for electroporating foreign plasmid DNA into Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 43121. METHODS AND RESULTS: The conditions of electroporation were optimized to improve the transformation efficiency. Plasmid pNZ123 containing multicloning site and chloramphenicol resistance was employed to construct a cloning vector. The optimum electroporation conditions for the maximum transformation efficiency were a pulse strength of 12.5 kV cm(-1), a pulse number of 10, a pulse interval of 500 ms, and pNZ123 plasmid DNA concentration of 25 ng microl(-1). Under the optimum conditions the transformation efficiency of L. acidophilus ATCC 43121 was 1.84 +/- 0.13 x 10(4) (+/- standard error of measurements) CFU per mug of plasmid DNA. Other strains of L. acidophilus showed transformation efficiencies ranging from 1.38 +/- 0.02 x 10(4) to 9.32 +/- 0.54 x 10(4) under these conditions. A green fluorescent protein (GFP) was successfully expressed and detected by fluorescence microscopy when the pKU::slpA-GFP, pNZ123 containing GFP gene, was transformed in L. acidophilus ATCC 43121 under the optimum conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that electrical parameters, antibiotic concentration, and host specificity play important roles to determine transformation efficiency of lactobacilli. The optimum conditions for the transformation of L. acidophilus ATCC 43121 may be applied to improve transformation efficiency of other lactobacilli. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The optimized conditions for electrotransformation may provide a mean to improve the introduction of foreign DNA into L. acidophilus to be used as a vehicle for a heterologous protein expression.
TI  - Antimicrobial substantivity of cavity disinfectants.
AB  - This study involved a comparative examination of different disinfectant solutions and their antimicrobial substantivity against Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Candida albicans. All of the disinfectants containing chlorhexidine and benzalkonium chloride demonstrated substantive antibacterial activity. Chlorhexidine-based solutions displayed the longest and most effective antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Enhanced clearance of Candida albicans from the oral cavities of mice following oral administration of Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Orally administered live Lactobacillus acidophilus was assessed for its capacity  to enhance clearance from the oral cavity of DBA/2 mice shown previously to be 'infection prone'. L. acidophilus fed to DBA/2 mice significantly shortened the duration of colonization of the oral cavity compared to controls. Enhanced clearance of Candida albicans correlated with both early mRNA gene expression for interleukin (IL)-4 and interferon (IFN)-gamma and expression of their secreted products in cultures of cervical lymph nodes stimulated with Candida antigen. In addition rapid clearance correlated with higher levels of IFN-gamma and nitric oxide in saliva. Delayed clearance, less pronounced levels of the cytokine response, saliva IFN-gamma and nitric oxide, and later mRNA expression for IL-4 and IFN-gamma relative to feeding with the L. acidophilus isolate were noted in mice fed a different Lactobacillus isolate (L. fermentum). These observations indicate significant variations in individual isolates to activate the common mucosal system.
TI  - Raffinose family of oligosaccharides from lupin seeds as prebiotics: application  in dairy products.
AB  - The raffinose family of oligosaccharides (RFOs) isolated from lupin seeds (Lupinus albus var. Multolupa) was evaluated for bifidogenic effects during the manufacture of probiotic fermented milk. A mixed starter inoculum was composed of Bifidobacterium lactis Bb-12 and Lactobacillus acidophilus (1:1). Lupins are a rich source of RFOs that can be used as functional food ingredients. The addition of RFOs to milk increased B. lactis Bb-12 and L. acidophilus populations at the final fermentation time compared with controls. Final fermentation products are positively affected by addition of RFOs, and time of fermentation was reduced from 12 to 10 h. When RFOs were added to milk, they were preferentially used as a carbon source (57.7%) compared with lactose (23.7%) at the end of fermentation. These results suggest that the eventual choice of B. lactis Bb-12 and L. acidophilus in a mixed culture at a 1:1 ratio and addition of RFOs to produce a fermented milk product would have the advantages of rapid growth and acidificationrate and would likely increase the probiotic effect of the final functional product.
TI  - Antimicrobial potential of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Antibacterial activity is an important characteristic of probiotics. A possible way to achieve this antibacterial activity is through the production of bacteriocins. This study shows that the commercial probiotic strains Lactobacillus johnsonii LA1 and Lactobacillus casei YIT 9029 produce bacteriocins. The nature of the antimicrobial compound could be derived from its behaviour: a narrow inhibitory spectrum (only active against closely related strains), loss of activity when treated with proteinases, and rather small molecular masses (around 6000 Da or less). Further, three bacteriocins produced by Lb. johnsonii LA1, Lb. casei YIT 9029 and Lactobacillus amylovorus DCE 471 showed inhibitory activity against the human gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori. However, a fourth bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus IBB 801 was not able to inhibit H. pylori. This indicates that some bacteriocins produced by specific probiotic strains can fulfil a role in the inhibition of this common pathogen.
TI  - Reduction of beta-glucuronidase and nitroreductase activity by yoghurt in a murine colon cancer model.
AB  - Yoghurt feeding inhibits induced colon cancer in mice. Several studies showed the immunomodulatory effect of yoghurt which can explain this inhibition. It is possible that yoghurt bacteria can also affect gut flora enzymes related to colon carcinogenesis as reported for other probiotics in different animal tumours. The aim of this work was to evaluate the role of yoghurt starter bacteria and their cell-free fermentation products on the reduction of procarcinogen enzyme activities (beta-glucuronidase and nitroreductase). Mice injected with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) and fed with yoghurt were used for this study. Mice given milk or yoghurt supernatant (cell free extract) were used to evaluate if the yoghurt antitumour effect is due to the starter bacteria or other components released during fermentation, that could inhibit these enzymes. We determined that yoghurt by itself maintained enzymes activities similar or lower than non-treatment control group, and the enzyme activity was also lower than milk or yoghurt supernatant groups. DMH increased the activity of the enzymes. Mice injected with DMH and fed cyclically with yoghurt presented lower enzymes activities than the tumour control group. Feeding yoghurt decreased procarcinogenic enzyme levels in the large intestine contents of mice bearing colon tumour. The results of this study provide another mechanism by which yoghurt starter bacteria interact with the large intestine of the mice and prevent colon cancer.

TI  - Use of hydrolysates from Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.) viscera as a complex nitrogen source for lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Hydrolysates of cod viscera were tested as an alternative to commonly used complex nitrogen sources (peptones and/or extracts) for the type strains of the lactic acid bacteria Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus sakei and Pediococcus pentosaceus. Comparative studies with MRS-like media containing different nitrogen sources showed that all the fish hydrolysates performed equally well or better than commercial extracts/peptones for all selected lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Discovery of substituted isoxazolecarbaldehydes as potent spermicides, acrosin inhibitors and mild anti-fungal agents.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The continued endeavour to design novel, non-detergent molecules that can be useful as topical, prophylactic contraceptives has led to the discovery of substituted isoxazolecarbaldehydes as a new class of compounds exhibiting both spermicidal and acrosin inhibitory activities simultaneously. METHODS: Normal human semen samples were used to detect the spermicidal and acrosin inhibitory activities of the new compounds. Lactobacillus, HeLa and Candida cultures were used to determine the safety of compounds towards normal vaginal flora, their cytotoxicity and anti-fungal activity. Supravital staining and the hypo-osmotic swelling test (HOST) were used to detect the effect on sperm membrane integrity. Nonoxynol-9 (N-9) was used as a reference standard. RESULTS: The 5- and 3-substituted isoxazolecarbaldehydes showed significant spermicidal [minimum effective concentration (MEC)=0.005-2.5%] and acrosin inhibitory (IC50=3.9-58 x 10(-4) mol/l) activities in several molecules along with weak fungicidal activity against Candida albicans. Lineweaver-Burk and Dixon plot analysis of a representative structure showed non-competitive inhibition of human acrosin enzyme, and the most potent acrosin inhibitors also considerably diminished the induction of the acrosome reaction by Ca2+ ionophore. Some compounds were found to be significantly safer than N-9 towards Lactobacillus acidophilus in vitro at their respective spermicidal MECs. In the cytotoxicity assay, the IC50 of these compounds towards the HeLa cell line was of the same order as N-9 (0.9-0.1 mmol/l); however, in contrast, the compounds exhibited only a moderate effect on sperm membrane integrity. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that 5- and 3-substituted isoxazolecarbaldehydes are 'first generation' multifunctional, spermicidal molecules that hold promise for development as topical contraceptives with useful associated activities that can add considerably to their effectiveness, safety and prophylaxis.
TI  - New Lactobacillus acidophilus isolates reduce the release of leptin by murine adipocytes leading to lower interferon-gamma production.
AB  - Leptin produced by adipocytes increases Th1-dependent immunostimulation and autoimmune diseases. Lactobacilli are known to promote or suppress Th1 responses according to the isolates. We have investigated whether the sensitivity of Suriss Jim Lambert (SJL) mice to Th1-dependent immune diseases, when compared with C57BL/6 mice, may be modulated by selected lactobacilli able to decrease leptin release by adipocytes. White adipocytes were isolated from both C57BL/6 and SJL mice and incubated with bacterial extracts from new CBA4P and TPA3P isolates of Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. rhamnosus 9595 (LR), or with conditioned media (CM) from lactobacillus-treated macrophages. Immunomodulation induced by supernatants of treated adipocytes was determined by metabolic activity of syngenic splenic lymphocytes. Leptin produced by adipocytes, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1beta by macrophages, and IFN-gamma and IL-4 by lymphocytes were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests. Results revealed that supernatants from CBA4P- and LR-treated adipocytes decreased the metabolic activity of lymphocytes from SJL mice, whereas adipocytes incubated with CM from CBA4P-treated macrophages showed no stimulation of lymphocytes. Such effects correlated with leptin levels. Lower levels of leptin were produced by adipocytes from SJL mice in the presence of CBA4P and LR extracts. Lymphocytes from SJL mice produced low levels of IFN-gamma when incubated with supernatants from CBA4P-treated cells. Such immunosuppressive effects were dependent on levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta produced by lactobacillus-treated macrophages. Taken together, these results suggest that the CBA4P isolate reduces levels of leptin in SJL mice, leading to lower IFN-gamma production. Therefore, the CBA4P isolate of L. acidophilus is a promising new probiotic strain for the control of Th1 inflammatory diseases.
TI  - Influence of gastric colonization with Candida albicans on ulcer healing in rats: effect of ranitidine, aspirin and probiotic therapy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Candida albicans frequently inhabits the gastrointestinal tract of humans leading to gastrointestinal candidiasis, especially following suppression of gastric acidity, but studies on the relation between this fungal infection and gastric pathology are limited due to lack of convenient animal models resembling Candida infection in humans. MATERIAL AND METHODS. We compared the effects of C. albicans and vehicle inoculation on gastric secretion and healing of gastric ulcers induced by acetic acid in rats treated with 1) ranitidine (30 mg kg(-1) day(-1) s.c.) and 2) aspirin (ASA) (60 mg kg(-1) day(-1) i.g.) with or without probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus acidophillus. At day 0 and at 4, 15 and 25 days after ulcer induction, the ulcer area, the gastric blood flow (GBF), the quantitative gastric cultures of Candida and the expression of mRNAs for pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and TNF-alpha and growth factors EGF and TGFalpha were assessed in the gastric mucosa. RESULTS: Gastric acid output was reduced by over 40% soon after Candida inoculation and this effect persisted during all time intervals tested. The area of ulcers in control rats significantly decreased at day 15 and the ulcers disappeared almost completely after 25 days of their induction. In contrast, the ulcers were present until day 25 in Candida-inoculated rats followed by a fall in GBF and a rise in plasma gastrin levels, these effects being significantly attenuated by the co-treatment with Lactobacillus. Candidiasis was accompanied by up-regulation of mRNA for IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, EGF and TGFalpha and a significant increment in plasma IL-1beta and TNF-alpha levels. CONCLUSIONS: 1) Persistent colonization with Candida could be achieved in rats treated with antisecretory agents or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ASA; 2) candidiasis reduces gastric acid secretion, while delaying ulcer healing possibly due to the impairment in GBF in the ulcer area and enhanced expression and release of IL-1beta and TNFalpha and 3) probiotic therapy could be useful in the treatment against the deleterious action of fungal infection on the healing of pre-existing gastric ulcers.
TI  - Ernst Moro (1874-1951)--a great pediatric career started at the rise of university-based pediatric research but was curtailed in the shadows of Nazi laws.
AB  - Ernst Moro was born on December 8, 1874, in Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian empire and attended university in Graz, Austria. Pediatrics, initially regarded as a part of internal medicine, was in its early days as an independent field at universities in German-speaking Europe. The first Chair of Pediatrics had been established in Vienna, Austria in 1884. Ten years later Germany was granted its first Chair in Berlin. Escherich, who held the first Chair of Pediatrics at Graz, was seen as one of the most respected pediatricians in Europe. Therefore, he was invited in 1904 to represent pediatrics together with the American Abraham Jacobi at the International World Congress on Science at the Saint Louis World Exposition in the United States. The high mortality of nearly 25% in infancy was seen as one of the main problems. Escherich's scientific work had established him as the leading bacteriologist. Moro's pediatric career started in Escherich's laboratory with experimental research on the physiology of digestion in infants. In 1900 he presented the first bacteriological characterisation of Lactobacillus acidophilus. In 1906 he received his venia legendi for his work on the bacterial flora in physiological and pathological conditions of the infantile intestine. In 1908 Moro won international reputation for his simple percutaneous skin test for tuberculosis, which was widely used in many countries as the "Moro test" at least until the 1960s. He described a carrot soup and other dietary prescriptions as helpful for diarrhoeal disease. In 1911 he became Head of the Children's Hospital at Heidelberg. In 1918 he described some features peculiar to the first 3 months; according to him this trimenon should be regarded as an own entity like the newborn period. The most famous part of the paper was the description of a milestone in the infant's neurological development, the Umklammerungsreflex (embracing reflex). In 1919 Moro was promoted from associate professor to the first 'Ordinarius', thus founding the first Chair of Pediatrics at Heidelberg and marking the beginning of a scientifically most fruitful period of international collaboration. However, as his wife was of Jewish origin, Moro slowly withdrew from hospital service starting in 1933. After early retirement in 1936, he worked as a pediatrician at home until 1948.
TI  - Purification and characterisation of acidocin D20079, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus DSM 20079.
AB  - Bacteriocins are natural antimicrobial agents produced by food fermentative bacteria. Lactobacillus acidophilus DSM 20079 produces a small bacteriocin, with a molecular mass of 6.6 kDa, designated acidocin D20079. This antimicrobial peptide was extremely heat-stable (30 min at 121 degrees C) and was active over a wide pH range. It was found to be sensitive to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, ficin, pepsin, papain, and proteinase K). Acidocin D20079 has a narrow inhibitory spectrum restricted to the genus Lactobacillus which includes L. sakei NCDO 2714, an organism known to cause anaerobic spoilage of vacuum-packaged meat. Maximum production of acidocin D20079 in MRS broth was detected at pH 6.0, and the peptide was purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation followed by sequential cation exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Purified acidocin D20079 spontaneously formed spherulite crystals during dialysis. As the N-terminus was found to be blocked for sequencing, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was used to determine a partial sequence, and the molecular mass of the bacteriocin in the formed crystals (6.6 kDa). Estimates of the molecular weight of the partially purified peptide, using tricine-SDS-PAGE, in which bacteriocin activity was confirmed by overlayer techniques were in accordance with this value.
TI  - Influence of cooling temperature and duration on cold adaptation of Lactobacillus acidophilus RD758.
AB  - The effect of different cooling temperatures and durations on resistance to freezing and to frozen storage at -20 degrees C in Lactobacillus acidophilus RD758 was studied, by using a central composite rotatable design. A cold adaptation was observed when the cells were maintained at moderate temperature (26 degrees C) for a long time (8h) before being cooled to the final temperature of 15 degrees C. These conditions led to a low rate of loss in acidification activity during frozen storage (0.64 minday(-1)) and a high residual acidification activity after 180 days of frozen storage (1011 min). The experimental design allowed us to determine optimal cooling conditions, which were established at 28 degrees C during 8h. Adaptation to cold temperatures was related to an increase in the unsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratio and in the relative cycC19:0 fatty acid concentration. Moreover, an increased synthesis of four specific proteins was observed as an adaptive response to the optimal cooling conditions. They included the stress protein ATP-dependent ClpP and two cold induced proteins: pyruvate kinase and a putative glycoprotein endopeptidase.
TI  - Screening of potential lactobacilli antigenotoxicity by microbial and mammalian cell-based tests.
AB  - Antigenotoxicity is considered an important property for probiotic lactobacilli.  The ability of non probiotic lactobacilli from dairy products and starters to inhibit two reference genotoxins: 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine was evaluated. The study was carried out using short-term assays with different targets, such as procaryotic cells (SOS-Chromotest for genotoxicity in Escherichia coli and Ames test for mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium) and eucaryotic cells (Comet assay for genotoxicity in Caco-2 enterocytes). A high proportion of strains inhibiting 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide activity was found in Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Lactobacillus plantarum. Inhibition of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine activity occurred in only one L. acidophilus strain. All the strains with antigenotoxic properties also demonstrated antimutagenic activity and produced modifications in genotoxin spectroscopic profiles. Strain viability during and after genotoxin exposure was confirmed. Concordance of the results obtained with microbial and mammalian cell-based tests is underlined.
TI  - Comparison of the antimicrobial activity of six irrigants on primary endodontic pathogens.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the antimicrobial activities of 6% and 3% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), 2% and 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX), and 0.01% and 0.005% doxycycline (Doxy) on four microorganisms associated with primary endodontic infections. The agar diffusion test was used to measure antimicrobial activities of these agents against Peptostreptococcus micros, Prevotella intermedia, Streptococcus sanguis, and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Minimum inhibitory concentration analysis was performed using the macrodilution method. For three of the four microorganisms, the general order of antimicrobial effectiveness was 0.01% Doxy >0.005% Doxy >6% NaOCl >3% NaOCl >2% CHX > 0.12% CHX. For L. acidophilus, the order of effectiveness was 6% NaOCl >3% NaOCl >2% CHX > 0.01% Doxy >0.005% Doxy >0.12% CHX. The 6% NaOCl showed significantly greater zones of inhibition than 3% NaOCl for all endopathogens tested.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of probiotics microorganisms adhesion to an artificial caries model.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This in vitro study compared the adhesion of two probiotics microorganisms (Lactobacillus casei Shirota and Lactobacillus acidophilus) to an artificial caries model. METHOD: In total, 30 bovine teeth were longitudinally sectioned, excluding the lingual half surface. The specimens were covered with nail varnish, except for an area of 3 by 5 mm in dentin, suspended in an artificial caries solution promoted by Streptococcus mutans, and incubated at 37 degrees C. After 14 days, the specimens were separated equally into two groups and transferred to a brain heart infusion culture media containing L. acidophilus (group A) and L. casei Shirota (group S), at 37 degrees C. After 48 h, the exposed area of dentin was washed with 1 ml of distilled water and the caries dentin was removed and dispersed in 1 ml of saline solution. The samples of distilled water and caries dentin were diluted and inoculated in Rogosa selective Lactobacillus agar. The results in CFU/ml were analysed by the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between Groups A and S for the lactobacilli count in samples of distilled water (P = 0.237). CONCLUSIONS: The amount of L. acidophilus in the artificially caries dentin was significantly superior compared to L. casei Shirota (P = 0.047), suggesting an inferior adhesion potential for this microorganism.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species from the human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  - One hundred and twenty-two strains of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species have been tested against 12 antibiotics and two antibiotic mixtures by a commercial system (Sensititre Anaero3; Treck Diagnostic Systems). The upper limits of some minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were completed on MRS agar plates by the NCCLS procedure. All strains were sensitive to chloramphenicol and imipenem and most of the strains were resistant to metronidazole. Bifidobacteria isolates were susceptible to cefoxitin, whereas about half of the lactobacilli were resistant. Approximately 30% of the Bifidobacterium isolates were resistant to tetracycline, as well as five Lactobacillus strains belonging to four different species. None of the tested Bifidobacterium isolates was resistant to vancomycin, whereas a species-dependent resistance was found among the lactobacilli. Single strains of Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Lactobacillus brevis were resistant to erythromycin and/or clindamycin. Most of the observed resistances seemed to be intrinsic, but some others could be compatible with transmissible determinants.
TI  - A rare case of Lactobacillus acidophilus presenting as mitral valve bacterial endocarditis.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus is a gram-positive rod that is a commensal of human mucosal tissues. They are usually considered nonpathogenic flora of the mouth, gut, and female genital tract. Lactobacillus is a rare cause of endocarditis with less than 50 cases reported in the world literature to date. We report the case of a 63-year-old woman who developed native mitral valve endocarditis secondary to L. acidophilus, and examine the literature regarding this rare entity.
TI  - Recurrent vulvovaginitis candidiasis; an overview of traditional and alternative  therapies.
AB  - Vulvovaginitis is a common inflammatory condition that can significantly disrupt  a woman's life. The term vulvovaginitis actually encompasses a variety of inflammatory lower gential tract disorders that may be secondary to infection, irritation, allergy or systemic disease (Table 1). This article focuses on candida-caused vulvovaginitis, a condition known as vulvovaginitis candidiasis. Approximately 75% of U.S. women expreience vulvovaginitis candidiasis during thier reproductive years. Between 40% and 50% of these women have recurrent episodes, and 5% to 8% experience chronic candida infections. Approximately 3 million women have recurrent candidial infections. The prevalence of vulvovaginitis candiasis is expected to rise due to the growing number of non-C albicans species (which are immune to most antifungal medcationa) and as a result of more widespread antifungal resistance.
TI  - Amelioration of the effects of Citrobacter rodentium infection in mice by pretreatment with probiotics.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Citrobacter rodentium is a naturally occurring murine pathogen that causes colonic epithelial-cell hyperplasia, disrupts the colonic mucosa, and elicits a predominantly T helper 1 cellular immune response; it thereby serves as a model for the study of mechanisms of disease induced by human attaching-effacing pathogens. We sought to determine whether pretreatment of mice with a mixture of Lactobacillus rhamnosus and L. acidophilus probiotics would attenuate C. rodentium-induced colonic disease in mice. METHODS: Mice were administered sterile drinking water, probiotics (10(9) cfu/mL) in sterile drinking water, maltodextrin in sterile drinking water, orogastric C. rodentium (10(7) cfu in 0.1 mL), or maltodextrin in sterile drinking water for 1 week before C. rodentium infection, or they were pretreated with probiotics (10(9) cfu/mL) for 1 week before challenge with C. rodentium. RESULTS: Mice that received viable probiotics remained healthy. C. rodentium infection elicited mucosal inflammation, epithelial-cell hyperplasia, apoptosis in the colon, and interferon (IFN)- gamma production by splenocytes. Pretreatment with probiotics decreased levels of all but IFN- gamma production. CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment with probiotics attenuates the effects of C. rodentium infection in mice. Understanding the mechanism of these beneficial effects will aid in determining the efficacy of probiotics in preventing infection with related attaching-effacing enteric pathogens in humans.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of different generation dentin-bonding systems.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the antibacterial activities of different generation dentin-bonding systems. METHOD AND MATERIALS: The antibacterial activities of dentin-bonding systems Optibond FL Primer, Single Bond, Clearfil SE Bond Primer, and Prompt-L-Pop were evaluated against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Cervitec (1% chlorhexidine varnish) was also examined as a positive control material. Disk diffusion tests with filter paper disks (n = 10) containing a drop of each material (20 microL) were used. After incubation at 37 degrees C for 48 hours, the growth inhibition zones were measured in millimeters. RESULTS: Of all the materials tested, Optibond FL Primer, Clearfil SE Bond Primer, and Prompt-LPop showed larger growth inhibition zones than the control material for all bacterial strains. No antibacterial effect was noted for Single Bond. The results indicated that Optibond FL Primer had the strongest effect against the S mutans and L casei, and Clearfil SE Bond Primer produced the largest inhibition zone for S salivarius and L acidophilus among the test materials. CONCLUSION: The antibacterial effects observed for the tested different generation dentin-bonding systems may be related to the acidic nature of the materials.
TI  - Bacteriotherapy and probiotics' role on oral health.
AB  - Oral infections constitute some of the most common and costly forms of infections in humans. The concept of microbial ecological change as a mechanism for preventing dental disease is an important one while altered microbial ecology may lead to dental disease. New methods such as probiotic approaches (i.e. whole bacteria replacement therapy) to eliminate pathogenic members of the microbiota can be investigated. Bacteriotherapy is an alternative and promising way to combat infections by using harmless bacteria to displace pathogenic microorganisms. Probiotics are one of these new agents which are widely used for their therapeutic action. Limited research is available showing that some probiotic cultures may help dental improvement. Present paper focuses on possible oral benefits of probiotics.
TI  - [Relationships between the probiotic and host indigenous lactobacilli under the conditions of mixed cultivation in vitro].
AB  - Relationships between 5 Lactobacillus manufacturing strains, 458 cultures of indigenous lactobacilli isolated from the human digestive and vaginal tracts and 98 isolates from the feces of white rats and mice were under study. The study demonstrated that under the conditions of mixed in vitro cultivation of paired cultures, probiotic strains inhibited more than 60% of the indigenous lactobacilli isolates. L. acidophilus strain K3 III 24 had the widest spectrum of antagonistic activity. Antagonistic relationships between indigenous lactobacilli depended on the origin, individual features and the anatomical sites of the culture isolation. Based on these results it has to be suggested that probiotic lactobacilli are capable of inducing disbalance in the host indigenous lactoflora. While choosing probiotics the character of relationships between probiotic microorganisms and the indigenous lactobacilli of the future recipient is recommended to be preliminarily tested in vitro.

TI  - Marker-free chromosomal integration of the manganese superoxide dismutase gene (sodA) from Streptococcus thermophilus into Lactobacillus gasseri.
AB  - A strategy for functional gene replacement in the chromosome of Lactobacillus gasseri is described. The phospho-beta-galactosidase II gene (lacII) was functionally replaced by the manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) gene (sodA) from Streptococcus thermophilus, by adapting the insertional inactivation method described for lactobacilli [Russell, W.M. and Klaenhammer, T.R. 2001 Efficient system for directed integration into the Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus gasseri chromosomes via homologous recombination. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 67, 4361-4364]. L. gasseri carrying the heterologous sodA gene grew on lactose as efficiently as the wild-type parent. An active MnSOD was expressed in the transgenic strain, and the enzyme migrated on PAGE-SOD activity gels to the same position as that of MnSOD from S. thermophilus. The expression of MnSOD from a single copy of sodA integrated in the chromosome of L. gasseri provided enhanced tolerance to hydrogen peroxide, and extended the viability of carbon/energy starved cultures stored at 25 degrees C. This is the first report showing the successful utilization of the pORI plasmids system to generate marker-free gene integration in L. gasseri strains.
TI  - A synbiotic combination of resistant starch and Bifidobacterium lactis facilitates apoptotic deletion of carcinogen-damaged cells in rat colon.
AB  - Recent reports suggest that combinations of prebiotics and probiotics may be protective against colorectal cancer. We examined in rats the effects of probiotic bacteria, resistant starch (RS), and their interaction on luminal and epithelial events of relevance to the development of colorectal cancer. Lyophilized cultures (1 x 10(10) cfu/g) of Lactobacillus acidophilus and/or Bifidobacterium lactis were added at a concentration of 1% by weight to a semipurified diet containing either low-RS (no supplemented RS) or moderate-RS (10% Hi-maize) and fed to male Sprague-Dawley rats for 4 wk. Experimental end-points included cecal bacterial enumeration, fecal and cecal pH, SCFA levels, cell proliferation, and the acute apoptotic response to a genotoxic carcinogen (AARGC; measured 6 h after a single azoxymethane injection). A significant interaction between dietary RS and supplemental bacteria was observed for the AARGC in the colon and fecal pH (P < 0.01). Rats fed the moderate-RS diet in combination with B. lactis had a significantly greater AARGC in the colon than those fed that diet without B. lactis. Fecal pH was elevated in the moderate-RS fed rats supplemented with bacteria. The moderate-RS diet increased cell proliferation and crypt column height (P < 0.001) compared with the low-RS diet. SCFA levels and numbers of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli species were also increased (P < 0.001) by the moderate-RS diet, whereas pH levels and total coliforms were lowered (P < 0.001). The synbiotic combination of RS and B. lactis significantly facilitated the apoptotic response to a genotoxic carcinogen in the distal colon of rats. It appears likely that ingested RS acts as a metabolic substrate, thus creating the right conditions for B. lactis to exert its proapoptotic action. Because the synbiotic combination of these agents facilitates the apoptotic response to DNA damage by a cancer initiator in the colon of rats, it warrants further study for its capacity to protect against colorectal cancer.
TI  - A double-blind placebo-controlled study of the effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus on plasma lipids.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To select a probiotic bacteria that would reduce serum lipids in hypercholesterolaemic volunteers. DESIGN: A strain of lactobacillus was selected for its ability to metabolise cholesterol under varying conditions in vitro. Freeze-dried Lactobacillus acidophilus or placebo were then given in a double-blind randomised crossover study to volunteers with high cholesterols. SUBJECTS: A total of 80 volunteers with elevated cholesterols. INTERVENTIONS: Volunteers were randomly allocated to receive either two capsules containing freeze-dried L. acidophilus 3 x 10(10) CFU or placebo three times a day for 6 weeks. After a 6-week washout period, volunteers were crossed over to another 6 weeks of capsules. Serum lipids were measured at the beginning and end of each interventional period. RESULTS: L. acidophilus was able to reduce cholesterol and survive in an acid and bile environment. No changes in anthropomorphic measurements or in dietary records were seen between the baseline and final records or between the two sets of baseline records. There were no changes in serum lipids seen throughout the study. CONCLUSION: Despite the ability in vitro for L. acidophilus to reduce cholesterol, no effect was seen in volunteers.
TI  - Characterization of a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus faecium GM-1 isolated  from an infant.
AB  - AIM: To partially characterize the bacteriocin produced by the GM-1 strain of Enterococcus faecium, isolated from the faeces of a newborn human infant. METHODS AND RESULTS: The bacteriocin produced by E. faecium GM-1 showed a broad spectrum of activity against indicator strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio spp., Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. Treatment of the GM-1 bacteriocin with proteolytic enzymes reduced its inhibitory activities. The bacteriocin was stable at 100 degrees C for 20 min and displayed inhibitory activity at neutral pH. The optimal production of bacteriocin from E. faecium GM-1 was obtained when the culture conditions were pH 6.0-6.5 and 35-40 degrees C. The inhibitory activity of the bacteriocin was not substantially changed by the use of different carbon sources in the media, except when galactose was substituted for glucose. The use of a sole nitrogen source caused a decrease in inhibitory activity. A bacteriocin gene similar to enterocin P was identified from the total DNA of E. faecium GM-1 by PCR and direct sequencing methods. CONCLUSION: E. faecium GM-1, which was isolated from the faeces of a newborn baby, produces an enterocin P-like bacteriocin with inhibitory activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including food-borne pathogens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: E. faecium GM-1, isolated from infant faeces, produces a new bacteriocin that is similar to enterocin P. This bacteriocin is heat stable and has a broad antibacterial spectrum that includes both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Optimization of cholesterol removal, growth and fermentation patterns of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4962 in the presence of mannitol, fructo-oligosaccharide and inulin: a response surface methodology approach.
AB  - AIMS: To optimize cholesterol removal by Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4962 in the presence of prebiotics, and study the growth and fermentation patterns of the prebiotics. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4962 was screened in the presence of six prebiotics, namely sorbitol, mannitol, maltodextrin, hi-amylose maize, fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS) and inulin in order to determine the best combination for highest level of cholesterol removal. The first-order model showed that the combination of inoculum size, mannitol, FOS and inulin was best for removal of cholesterol. The second-order polynomial regression model estimated the optimum condition of the factors for cholesterol removal by L. acidophilus ATCC 4962 to be 2.64% w/v inoculum size, 4.13% w/v mannitol, 3.29% w/v FOS and 5.81% w/v inulin. Analyses of growth, mean doubling time and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production using quadratic models indicated that cholesterol removal and the production of SCFA were growth associated. CONCLUSIONS: Optimum cholesterol removal was obtained from the fermentation of L. acidophilus ATCC 4962 in the presence of mannitol, FOS and inulin. Cholesterol removal and the production of SCFA appeared to be growth associated and highly influenced by the prebiotics. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Response surface methodology proved reliable in developing the model, optimizing factors and analysing interaction effects. The results provide better understanding on the interactions between probiotic and prebiotics for the removal of cholesterol.
TI  - Hepatoprotective effect of lactic acid bacteria, inhibitors of beta-glucuronidase production against intestinal microflora.
AB  - The hepatoprotective activity of lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus brevis HY7401, Lactobacillus acidophilus CSG and Bifidobacterium longum HY8001), which inhibited beta-glucuronidase productivity of intestinal microflora, on t-BHP- or CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity of mice were evaluated. These oral administration of lactic acid bacteria lowered beta-glucuronidase production of intestinal microflora as well as Escherichia coli HGU-3. When lactic acid bacteria at a dose of 0.5 or 2 g (wet weight)/kg was orally administered on CCl4-induced liver injury in mice, these bacteria significantly inhibited the increase of plasma alanine transferase and aspartate transferase activities by 17-57% and 57-66% of the CCl4 control group, respectively. These lactic acid bacteria also showed the potent hepatoprotective effect against t-BHP-induced liver injury in mice. The inhibitory effects of these lactic acid bacteria were more potent than that of dimethyl diphenyl bicarboxylate (DDB), which have been used as a commercial hepatoprotective agent. Among these lactic acid bacteria, L. acidophilus CSG exhibited the most potent hepatoprotective effect. Based on these findings, we insist that an inhibitor of beta-glucuronidase production in intestine, such as lactic acid bacteria, may be hepatoprotective.
TI  - Microbiological quality of sous and tamarind, traditional drinks consumed in Jordan.
AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the microbiological quality of sous (a drink prepared by extracting dried roots of Glycyrrhiza glabra) and tamarind (a drink prepared by infusing Tamarindus indica dried pulp), traditional drinks consumed in Jordan. Twenty-one samples of sous and 44 samples of tamarind were collected from the local market in Amman, Jordan. Water is the major component of the drinks. Sous drink is characterized by having an alkaline pH (range, 6.6 to 9.9; mean, 8.6), whereas tamarind drink has an acidic pH (range, 1.8 to 3.7; mean, 2.8). The drinks are not processed for safety before serving, and at some vendors drinks are not properly refrigerated. The mean counts for aerobic bacteria, lactic acid bacteria, and yeasts in sous drink samples were 5.9, 5.0, and 3.8 log CFU/ml, respectively; those in tamarind drink samples were 4.0, <1, and 5.8 log CFU/ml, respectively. The lactic acid bacteria isolated were Enterococcus raffinosus, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus durans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus buchneri. The yeast isolates in sous drink were from the genera Candida, Filobasidium, Hanseniaspora, Lodderomyces, Pichia, and Williopsis, and those in tamarind drink were from Arthroascus, Brettanomyces, Candida, Debaromyces, Filobasidiella, Hanseniaspora, Klavispora, Lodderomyces, Pichia, Saccharomycodes, Trichosporon, and Zygosaccharomyces. Enterobacteriaceae were detected in two sous samples and were identified as Enterobacter sakazakii and Erwinia sp., and in two tamarind samples and were identified as Citrobacter freundii and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Salmonella was detected in one sous and one tamarind sample. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was detected in only one sous sample. These findings highlight the importance of application of hygienic practices throughout preparation and vending of drinks, starting with raw ingredients and continuing through preparation, storage, display, and serving.
TI  - Effect of probiotics on preventing disruption of the intestinal microflora following antibiotic therapy: a double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study.
AB  - In this pilot-scale, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 30 patients with Helicobacter pylori infection were randomised into three groups prior to their 7 days eradication therapy, to study the effects of probiotic supplement comprising Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum on the intestinal microflora in response to antibiotic therapy. Group I received the placebo product from day 1 to day 15, Group II received placebo from day 1 to day 7 and probiotics from day 8 to day 15 and Group III received probiotics from day 1 to day 15. Patients provided stool samples for analysis on days 1, 7, 12, 17 and 27. For patients in Groups I and II, significant increases in the facultative anaerobe component of the microflora occurred between days 1 and 7. In Group I, the numbers remained elevated to day 27 but in Group II, the numbers decreased significantly between days 7 and 27 back to the starting levels. In Group III, the facultative anaerobe population remained stable throughout. The total anaerobe numbers increased significantly at day 27 than at day 1 for Group I, were unchanged throughout for Group II and decreased significantly for the patients in Group III between days 1 and 7 before reverting to the starting levels by day 27. From these results, it can be seen that probiotic supplementation modulates the response of the intestinal microflora to the effects of antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Effects of probiotic bacteria on humoral immunity to Candida albicans in immunodeficient bg/bg-nu/nu and bg/bg-nu/+ mice.
AB  - Germfree beige-nude ( bg/bg-nu/nu) and beige-heterozygous ( bg/bg-nu/+) mice were colonized with a pure culture of Candida albicans or with a probiotic bacterium (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus casei, or Bifidobacterium infantis). Probiotic-colonized mice were subsequently challenged orally with C. albicans. The effect of prior colonization with probiotic bacteria on the antibody responses of the immunodeficient mice to alimentary tract colonization with C. albicans was compared to the antibody responses of the gnotobiotic mice colonized only with C. albicans. This study demonstrated that, although the probiotic bacteria did not induce a vigorous antibody response to their own antigens, they altered the antibody responses of mice to C. albicans. In T cell competent bg/bg-nu/+mice, B. infantis enhanced and focused IgG1, IgG2A, and IgA responses to C. albicans antigens. Some of the probiotic bacteria also enhanced the IgG1 and IgG2A antibody responses of bg/bg-nu/nu mice to C. albicans antigens. This study not only shows the value of gnotobiotic animal models in demonstrating that probiotic bacteria can affect the capacity of mice to form antibodies to C. albicans, but it also points out their usefulness in comparing the capacity of different probiotic bacteria to produce beneficial health effects in mice.
TI  - A dynamic model that simulates the human upper gastrointestinal tract for the study of probiotics.
AB  - A dynamic model of the human upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract was designed to better simulate conditions of ingestion and digestion, by including a food matrix as part of the model design. The dynamic model consisted of two reactors maintained at 37 degrees C, one simulating stomach conditions and the other simulating duodenum conditions. The model was tested by comparing survival of bacteria isolated from humans (Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Lactobacillus acidophilus) animals (Bifidobacterium animalis, 2 strains), and fermented dairy products (Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus kefir, Lactobacillus kefirgranum, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides) with their survival as determined by conventional methods. Five strains were not able to survive (>3 log reduction) 15 min in a medium acidified at pH 2.0 using the conventional testing method, but survival was improved significantly for some strains in the dynamic model. Two strains (Bifidobacterium animalis ATCC 25527 and Lactobacillus johnsonii La-1 NCC 533) showed good survival with both methods. The dynamic model was shown to better represent the events during upper GI tract transit than the conventional methods, by incorporation of a food matrix to buffer the gastric acidity and therefore expose bacteria to pH levels found in vivo before, during, and after a meal.
TI  - [Evaluation of the effect of probiotic cultures on two different yogurt brands over a known population of Staphylococcus aureus and the production of thermonuclease].
AB  - The effect of probiotic cultures over known populations of Staphylococcus aureus  inoculated in yogurt was studied; also the production and stability of its thermonuclease during yogurt storage was evaluated. In three different occasions, two different yogurt brands, one with additional probiotic cultures (Lactobacillus casei and L. acidophilus), were inoculated with known populations of S. aureus in high and low concentration (10(9) CFU/g and 10(7) CFU/g), respectively. These samples were stored for 28 days at 5 degrees C. Every four days the count of lactic bacteria, S. aureus and pH were evaluated, according to the methodology described in the Compendium of Methods for the Microbiological Examination of Foods, Vanderzant & Splittstoesser. The presence of thermonuclease was determined using petrifilm for S. aureus from 3M company. The pH and lactic bacteria population were constant during the testing period. Yogurt with additional probiotic cultures (high and low concentration) lowered the population of S. aureus to non detectable levels in 8 days; but, S. aureus could be cultured from yogurt without probiotics even after 24 days of incubation. Same time, the presence of thermonuclease was positive in all tests; it was not affected by probiotics. The presence of thermonuclease is related to the production of S. aureus enterotoxin. This work emphasizes again the beneficial effects of probiotic cultures in yogurt over bacteria and the importance of keeping hygienic practices in order to avoid the contamination of food with S. aureus and the eventual production of its enterotoxin, since it is not affected by probiotics.
TI  - [Evaluation of the effect of probiotic cultures added to commercial yogurt over a known population of Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli O157:H7].
AB  - The effect of probiotic cultures over Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli O157:H7 during yogurt storage was evaluated. Two different yogurt brands, one with additional probiotic cultures (Lactobacillus casei and L. acidophilus) were inoculated with known populations (106 UFC/g) of either L. monocytogenes or E. coli O157:H7 in three different times and stored for 32 days at 5 degrees C. Every four days the count of lactic bacteria, the added pathogens and pH was evaluated, according to the methodology described in the Bacteriological Analytical Manual. The pH and lactic bacteria population were constant during the testing period. Yogurt with additional probiotic cultures reduced the population of L. monocytogenes in 8 days, the population of E. coli O157:H7 in 16; yogurt with no additional probiotics took 20 days to reduce L. monocytogenes to non-detectable levels and even after 28 days of storage, E. coli O157:H7 was cultured. In this work, the beneficial effects of additional probiotic cultures in yogurt is confirmed again.
TI  - [Influence of nutritional status on the effectiveness of a dietary supplement of  live lactobacillus to prevent and cure diarrhoea in children].
AB  - The influence of undernutrition on the effectiveness of a dietary supplement of live lactobacillus regarding prevention and treatment of infantile diarrhoea was studied on 200 children 6 to 24m old. Children, undernourished (D) or controls (C), received for 90 days, in a blind experiment, a fermented milk providing L. Acidofilus y L. Casei (10(7)-10(8)/ml) (LB) or an equivalent amount of fluid milk (L). diarrhoea episodes were recorded and classified according duration: 1-4, 5-14 days, and protracted diarrhea (DP) those lasting beyond 14 days. Study requirements were fulfilled by 119 children: D-L: n=25; D-LB: n=32; C-L: n=27 y C-LB: n=35. Preventive aspects were evaluated through number of episodes and through their lasting the therapeutic ones. Episodes recorded were 134: 29 in D-L; 48 in D-LB; 37 in C-L and 20 in C-LB. In the D-LB group over 90% episodes were very short (1-4 days), percentage far higher to that observed in D-L and similar to C-LB. There were 12 episodes of DP, 9 D and 3 in C, all in the L groups. In conclusion, although the fermented milk prevent half episode in the controls but not in the undernourished, it was able to shorter episodes duration and prevent protracted diarrhoea irrespectively of nutritional status. Therefore, undernutrition impaired the ability of the lactobacillus supplement to prevent children diarrhoea, which implicates immune system, but not curative effects which are the result of local actions.
TI  - The effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium spp. administration on the morphology of the gastrointestinal tract, liver and pancreas in piglets.
AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of administration of probiotic bacteria on morphology of the gastrointestinal tract, liver and pancreas. The experiment was performed on 15 piglets at the age from 3 to 35 days, intragastrically administered with Bifidobacterium breve, B. animalis, and Lactobacillus acidophilus bacteria. In all piglets examined, the development of the gastrointestinal tract, liver and pancreas was observed to progress normally. After microflora administration to the piglets, an increase in the number of fibrocytes and fibroblasts was observed in the mucosa lamina propria of stomach and intestines. An increase was also reported in the number and activation of endocrine cells in the stomach and small intestines. The activity of alkaline and acid phosphatases, as well as succinic (SDH) and lactic (LDH) dehydrogenases, was found to be higher after the administration of probiotics. The administration of bacteria, especially of Lactobacillus acidophilus, caused an increase in the number of lymphocytes and lymphoid cells in lamina propria and intraepithelial lymphocytes in the small intestine. Enhanced proliferation of crypt cells was observed in the crypts of intestinal glands; however, there were no statistically significant differences in the PCNA index between the control and probiotic-administered groups. The performed study showed that the administration of probiotic bacteria has no negative impact on the morphology of the gastrointestinal tract, liver and pancreas and is found beneficial to its functioning and immune processes.
TI  - Antioxidative activity of lactobacilli measured by oxygen radical absorbance capacity.
AB  - The reducing ability and antioxidative activity of some species of Lactobacillus  were compared under in vitro conditions. Cultures of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus casei were grown at 37 degrees C in de Man, Rogosa, Sharpe (MRS) broth supplemented with 0.5% 2,3,5 triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) to evaluate reducing activity. Reduced TTC was extracted from the cultures with acetone, and the intensity of the red color measured colorimetrically at 485 nm was an indication of reducing activity. The lactobacilli varied significantly in relative ability to reduce TTC when grown in MRS broth for 15 h. The relative amounts of growth as indicated by pH values at 18 h appeared to influence the amount of reduction. Antioxidative activity was evaluated by the ability of the whole cells or the cell-free extracts from cultures to protect a protein from being attacked by free radicals. These analyses were performed using the oxygen radical absorbance capacity method. All cultures tested exhibited some degree of antioxidative activity. Among the treatments, the cell-free extracts from cells grown in MRS broth exhibited significantly higher values than did whole cells. There was no apparent relationship between the reducing and antioxidative activities of the cultures evaluated. The results from this study show that these cultures can provide a source of dietary antioxidants. Furthermore, selection of cultures that produce antioxidants as starters could provide yet another health or nutritional benefit from cultured or culture-containing dairy products.
TI  - Optimization of lactic acid production in SSF by Lactobacillus amylovorus NRRL B-4542 using Taguchi methodology.
AB  - Lactic acid production parameter optimization using Lactobacillus amylovorus NRRL B-4542 was performed using the design of experiments (DOE) available in the form of an orthogonal array and a software for automatic design and analysis of the experiments, both based on Taguchi protocol. Optimal levels of physical parameters and key media components namely temperature, pH, inoculum size, moisture, yeast extract, MgSO4 . 7H20, Tween 80, and corn steep liquor (CSL) were determined. Among the physical parameters, temperature contributed higher influence, and among media components, yeast extract, MgSO4 . 7H20, and Tween 80 played important roles in the conversion of starch to lactic acid. The expected yield of lactic acid under these optimal conditions was 95.80% and the actual yield at optimum conditions was 93.50%.
TI  - Construction of a combined physical and genetic map of the chromosome of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 and characterization of the rRNA operons.
AB  - The combination of PFGE and hybridization approaches was used to study the genome of Lactobacillus acidophilus neotype strain ATCC 4356. PFGE analysis of chromosomal DNA after digestion with each of the rare-cutting restriction enzymes I-CeuI, NotI, CspI, SmaI, ApaI and SgrAI allowed the size of the circular chromosome of L. acidophilus to be estimated at 2.061 Mbp. The physical map contained 86 restriction sites for the six enzymes employed, with intervals between the sites varying from 1 to 88 kbp (approximately 0.05-4.3 % of the chromosome). Based on the physical map, a genetic map was constructed via Southern blot analyses of L. acidophilus DNA using specific gene probes. A total of 73 probes representing key genes, including 12 rRNA (rrn) genes, were positioned on the latter map. Mapping analysis also indicated the presence of four rrn operons (rrnA-D) on the chromosome, each containing a single copy of each of the three rrn genes 16S (rrl), 23S (rrs) and 5S (rrf). Operon rrnD was inverted in orientation with respect to the others and contained a long 16S-23S intergenic spacer region with tRNAIle and tRNAAla genes, whereas the other operons contained a short spacer lacking any tRNA genes. The high-resolution physical/genetic map constructed in this study provides a platform for genomic and genetic studies of Lactobacillus species and for improving industrial and probiotic strains.
TI  - Biography of Todd R. Klaenhammer.
AB  
TI  - Bifidobacterium Lactis sp. 420 up-regulates cyclooxygenase (Cox)-1 and down-regulates Cox-2 gene expression in a Caco-2 cell culture model.
AB  - Cyclooxygenases (Cox) -1 and -2 play important roles in gastrointestinal health;  chronic overexpression of Cox-2 is associated with inflammatory and cancerous disease, whereas Cox-1 is expressed constitutively. We studied the effects of two probiotic (Bifidobacterium lactis sp. 420 and Lactobacillus acidophilus) and two control microorganisms (Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis) and four microbial metabolites (acetate, butyrate, lactate and propionate) on the expression levels of the Cox isoforms in the enterocyte-like cell line Caco-2. Butyrate, which is anticarcinogenic, resulted in an 85% down-regulation of Cox-2 and a 37-fold increase in Cox-1 transcription. Propionate gave similar results (72% reduction of Cox-2, 23-fold induction of Cox-1), but lactate and acetate had no effect on Cox expression profile. Bifidobacterium sp. 420, which produces acetate and lactate but no butyrate or propionate, shared the Cox-1-increasing and Cox-2-silencing properties of butyrate and propionate, whereas L. acidophilus was similar to E. coli and S. enteritidis in having no effect on the Cox-1/Cox-2 ratio. For the first time, we therefore demonstrate evidence for a direct relationship between a probiotic bacterial strain and host Cox expression profile, suggesting that modulation of Cox expression may be an important factor in the potential anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties of some probiotics.
TI  - The effect of soy consumption on the urinary 2:16-hydroxyestrone ratio in postmenopausal women depends on equol production status but is not influenced by probiotic consumption.
AB  - Some epidemiologic studies reported an association between a low ratio of urinary 2-hydroxyestrogens (2-hydroxyestradiol + 2-hydroxyestrone) to 16alpha-hydroxyestrone (2:16OHE(1)) and increased breast cancer risk. Some studies show that soy consumption increases this ratio, and it is suggested that this effect may reduce breast cancer risk. We hypothesized that consumption of probiotic bacteria would alter fecal bacteria and enzymes involved in soy isoflavone metabolism, thereby increasing isoflavone bioavailability and enhancing the beneficial effects of soy on estrogen metabolism. Breast cancer survivors (n = 20) and controls (n = 20) were given 4 treatments for 6 wk each, separated by 2-wk washout periods, in a randomized, crossover design: soy protein (26.6 +/- 4.5 g protein/d containing 44.4 +/- 7.5 mg isoflavones/d); soy protein + probiotics (10(9) colony-forming units Lactobacillus acidophilus DDS(R)+1 & Bifidobacterium longum, 15-30 mg fructooligosaccharide/d); milk protein (26.6 +/- 4.5 g protein/d); and milk protein + probiotics. Survivors tended to have a lower baseline urine 2:16OHE(1) ratio than controls (P = 0.10). In the group as a whole, soy consumption tended to increase urinary 2-hydroxyestrogens (P = 0.07) and 16alpha-hydroxyestrone (P = 0.11) but had no effect on the urinary 2:16OHE(1) ratio. When subjects were divided into groups by plasma concentrations and urinary levels of the daidzein metabolite equol, soy increased urinary 2-hydroxyestrogens (P = 0.01) and the 2:16OHE(1) ratio (P = 0.04) only in subjects with high plasma equol concentrations. None of these results were influenced by probiotic consumption. These results are consistent with studies that found lower urine 2:16OHE(1) ratios in women with breast cancer and suggest that soy consumption increases this ratio only in women who are equol producers.
TI  - Challenges in the addition of probiotic cultures to foods.
AB  - Probiotic cultures are increasingly being added to foods in order to develop products with health-promoting properties. Although the literature is abundant on the beneficial effects of bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus acidophilus on health, little information is available on the challenges industry faces in adding these probiotic cultures to food products. The aim of this article is to examine seven issues that should be addressed when developing functional foods: 1) type or form of probiotic that should be used; 2) addition level required to have a beneficial effect; 3) toxicity; 4) effect of the processing steps on viability; 5) determination, in the product, of the cell populations added; 6) stability during storage; 7) changes in sensory properties of the foods.
TI  - Selective growth-inhibiting effects of compounds identified in Tabebuia impetiginosa inner bark on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The growth-inhibiting activity of anthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid and lapachol identified in the inner bark of taheebo, Tabebuia impetiginosa, toward 10 human intestinal bacteria was evaluated by using a paper disk diffusion bioassay and compared to those of seven lapachol congeners (1,4-naphthoquinone, naphthazarin, menadione, lawsone, plumbagin, juglone, and dichlone) as well as two commercially available antibiotics, chloramphenicol and tetracycline. Anthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid exhibited very strong growth inhibition of Clostridium paraputrificum at 1 microg/disk while 100 microg/disk of lapachol was needed for moderate growth inhibition of the same organism. These two isolates exhibited weak inhibition of Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli at 100 microg/disk while no adverse effects were observed on the growth of Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus casei at 1000 microg/disk. Structure-activity relationships indicate that a methyl group in the C-2 position of 1,4-naphthoquinone derivatives might play an important role in antibacterial activity.
TI  - Bacterial counts of intestinal Lactobacillus species in infants with colic.
AB  - Intestinal colonization by lactobacilli is suggested to be a prerequisite to normal mucosal immune functions. An inadequate level of lactobacilli may be involved in appearance of allergic disease of which, infantile colic, is often considered an early clinical manifestation. The aim of the study is to evaluate intestinal lactobacilli in breast-fed infants with infantile colic and healthy infants. Fifty-six breast-fed infants, aged 15-60 days were enrolled in the study and divided into two groups: colicky (30 cases) and healthy (26 cases) according to Wessel's criteria. Stool samples were collected, diluted and cultured on selective media. The colonies were counted, reported as colony forming unit (cfu) per gram of faeces and identified by biochemical methods. Different colonization patterns of lactobacilli were found among colicky and healthy infants. Lactobacillus brevis (4.34 x 10(8) cfu/g) and L. lactis lactis (2.51 x 10(7) cfu/g) were found only in colicky infants while L. acidophilus (2.41 x 10(7) cfu/g) was found only in healthy infants. Lactobacillus brevis and L. lactis lactis might be involved in the pathogenesis of infantile colic increasing meteorism and abdominal distension. Further studies are required to understand how the observed differences may be involved in the pathogenesis of this common disorder.
TI  - Reduction of Escherichia coli O157 in finishing beef cattle by various doses of Lactobacillus acidophilus in direct-fed microbials.
AB  - Our objective was to evaluate the effects of three doses of Lactobacillus acidophilus strain NP51 and a combination treatment of strains NP51 and NP45 on prevalence of Escherichia coli O157 in cattle. Three hundred steers were assigned randomly to 60 pens (five steers per pen) and received one of five treatments: (i) control, no added direct-fed microbial; (ii) HNP51, high dose of NP51 at 10(9) CFU per steer daily; (iii) MNP51, NP51 at 10(8) CFU per steer daily; (iv) LNP51, low dose of NP51 at 10(7) CFU per steer daily; and (v) NP51+45, NP51 at 10(9) CFU per steer daily and NP45 at 106 CFU per steer daily. All direct-fed microbial treatments included Propionibacterium freudenreichii at 10(9) CFU per steer. Individual rectal fecal samples were collected on arrival and every 28 days throughout the feeding period. Fecal and hide samples were collected on the day of harvest. Samples were analyzed for presence of E. coli O157 using immunomagnetic separation methods. Cattle receiving HNP51, MNP51, and LNP51 had a lower prevalence (P < 0.01) of E. coli O157 throughout the feeding period compared with the controls, and the dose response for NP51 was a linear decrease in prevalence with increasing dose (P < 0.01). No decrease in prevalence for cattle receiving the combination NP51+45 was detected compared with controls (P = 0.15). E. coli O157 prevalences averaged across collection times were 23.9, 10.5, 9.9, 6.8, and 17.3% for cattle in the control, LNP51, MNP51, HNP51, and NP51 +45 groups, respectively. Least squares mean estimates of fecal prevalence at harvest of E. coli O157 were 31.7, 12.5, 17.4, 8.2, and 41.6% among cattle in the control, LNP51, MNP51, HNP51, and NP51+45 groups, respectively. Least squares mean estimates of the percentage of positive hide samples at harvest were 8.7, 5.9, 4.8, 3.4, and 8.6% among cattle in the control, LNP51, MNP51, HNP51, and NP51+45 groups, respectively. The greatest decrease in E. coli O157 carriage was achieved using NP51 at 10(9) CFU per steer.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility profiles of new probiotic Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains.
AB  - The antimicrobial susceptibilities and presence of plasmids in four new probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains, Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 (DR20) HN067, Lactobacillus acidophilus HN017 and Bifidobacterium lactis HN019 (DR10), were determined. Resistance to 18 commonly used antibiotics was assessed by disk diffusion. The three Lactobacillus strains had similar antibiotic susceptibility profiles to those of Lactobacillus plantarum strain HN045 and two commercial probiotic Lactobacillus strains, GG and LA-1. The B. lactis strain HN019 had a similar profile to three commercial probiotic B. lactis strains (Bb12, HN049 and HN098). All 10 strains were sensitive to the Gram-positive spectrum antibiotics erythromycin and novobiocin, the broad-spectrum antibiotics rifampicin, spectinomycin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol and the beta-lactam antibiotics penicillin, ampicillin and cephalothin. By contrast, most strains were resistant to the Gram-negative spectrum antibiotics fusidic acid, nalidixic acid and polymyxin B and the aminoglycosides neomycin, gentamicin, kanamycin and streptomycin. All three L. rhamnosus strains (HN001, HN067 and GG) were resistant to vancomycin and several strains were also resistant to cloxacillin. Of the four new probiotic strains, only L. rhamnosus HN001 contained plasmids; however, a plasmid-free derivative of HN001 had the same antibiotic susceptibility profile as the parent strain.
TI  - Influence of dentin on the effectiveness of antibacterial agents.
AB  - The influence of dentin on the effectiveness of three antibacterial agents (triclosan, glutaraldehyde, NaOCl) on Streptococcus mutans, S. sobrinus, and Lactobacillus acidophilus was tested using the agar diffusion method with and without bovine dentin discs (200 mum and 500 mum thickness) placed between bacteria and test substances. The effect of 0.3% triclosan on all tester strains (100%) was reduced after passage through 500 mum dentin discs to 0% (L. acidophilus) and to 22% and 28% (S. mutans and S. sobrinus). Seal&Protect (Dentsply, Konstanz, Germany), a triclosan containing dental bonding agent, produced inhibition zones only against S. mutans, but no zone when applied on 200 mum dentin discs. The inhibition zones for 1% NaOCl and 5% glutaraldehyde against all tester strains were significantly increased up to 230% (glutaraldehyde) and 236% (NaOCl) when applied on dentin discs, compared to direct application (100%). Dentin may either decrease or increase the inhibitory effect of antibacterial agents.
TI  - Complete genome sequence of the probiotic lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM is a probiotic bacterium that has been produced commercially since 1972. The complete genome is 1,993,564 nt and devoid of plasmids. The average GC content is 34.71% with 1,864 predicted ORFs, of which 72.5% were functionally classified. Nine phage-related integrases were predicted, but no complete prophages were found. However, three unique regions designated as potential autonomous units (PAUs) were identified. These units resemble a unique structure and bear characteristics of both plasmids and phages. Analysis of the three PAUs revealed the presence of two R/M systems and a prophage maintenance system killer protein. A spacers interspersed direct repeat locus containing 32 nearly perfect 29-bp repeats was discovered and may provide a unique molecular signature for this organism. In silico analyses predicted 17 transposase genes and a chromosomal locus for lactacin B, a class II bacteriocin. Several mucus- and fibronectin-binding proteins, implicated in adhesion to human intestinal cells, were also identified. Gene clusters for transport of a diverse group of carbohydrates, including fructooligosaccharides and raffinose, were present and often accompanied by transcriptional regulators of the lacI family. For protein degradation and peptide utilization, the organism encoded 20 putative peptidases, homologs for PrtP and PrtM, and two complete oligopeptide transport systems. Nine two-component regulatory systems were predicted, some associated with determinants implicated in bacteriocin production and acid tolerance. Collectively, these features within the genome sequence of L. acidophilus are likely to contribute to the organisms' gastric survival and promote interactions with the intestinal mucosa and microbiota.
TI  - Effects of cecropin-XJ on growth and adherence of oral cariogenic bacteria in vitro.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cecropin-XJ belongs to cecropin-B, which is the most potent antibacterial peptide found naturally. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of cecropin-XJ on growth and adherence of oral cariogenic bacteria. METHODS: Four oral cariogenic bacteria (Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces naeslundii) were chosen for this experiment. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and reductive percent of bacterial growth were used to assay the antibacterial activity of cecropin-XJ. Mammalian cytotoxicity of cecropin-XJ was tested with human periodontal membrane fibroblasts by tetrazolium (MTT) colorimetric assay. The bacterial morphological changes induced by cecropin-XJ were examined on scanning electron microscope (SEM). The influence of cecropin-XJ on bacterial adhesion to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (S-HA) was measured by scintillation counting. RESULTS: The MICs of cecropin-XJ for inhibition of the growth of four bacteria ranged from 4.0 to 42.8 micromol/L with the highest susceptible to A. naeslundii and the lowest susceptible to L. acidophilus. At pH 6.8, 5.5 and 8.2, 1/2 MIC of cecropin-XJ reduced the number of viable bacteria by 40.9%, 67.8% and 32.8% for S. mutans and by 28.1%, 57.2% and 37.9% for L. acidophilus. The activities against S. mutans and L. acidophilus increased at pH 5.5 compared with pH 6.8 (P < 0.01, respectively). In present of 50% saliva, 1/2 MIC of the peptide decreased the direct count of viable cells by 29.2% and 14.4% for S. mutans and L. acidophilus, respectively (P < 0.01 and P > 0.05, respectively), whereas almost no reduction counts were detected in the presence of 20% serum for both bacteria (P > 0.05, respectively). Mammalian cytotoxicity of cecropin-XJ from 1.0 to 100 micromol/L exhibited no cytotoxicity against human periodontal membrane fibroblasts (P > 0.05). Bacterial morphological changes induced by MIC of cecropin-XJ examined on SEM showed cell surface disruption. Furthermore, the ability of A. naeslundii adhesion to S-HA decreased significantly with MIC of cecropin-XJ for 10 and 20 minutes (P = 0.001 and 0.000, respectively), and S. mutans, A. viscosus to S-HA decreased significantly with MIC of cecropin-XJ for 20 minutes (P = 0.000, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Cecropin-XJ exhibited bactericidal action against cariogenic pathogens, and the antibacterial activity enhanced in the acid environment. The results also demonstrate that cecropin-XJ prevents S. mutans and actinomyces adsorption to S-HA. These findings suggest that Cecropin-XJ may have potential to prevent caries.
TI  - Importance of S-layer proteins in probiotic activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus M92.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the functional role of surface layer proteins (S-layer) in probiotic strain Lactobacillus acidophilus M92, especially its influence on adhesiveness to mouse ileal epithelial cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of cell surface proteins revealed the presence of potential surface layer (S-layer) proteins, ca at 45 kDa in L. acidophilus M92. Southern blot with pBK1 plasmid, containing slpA gene, gave a positive signal, suggesting that L. acidophilus M92 has a slpA gene coding for the S-layer proteins. S-layer proteins of this strain are present during all phases of growth. The S-layer proteins appeared when cells treated with 5 mol l(-1) LiCl were allowed to grow again. Removal of the S-layer proteins reduced adhesion of L. acidophilus M92 to mouse ileal epithelial cells. Furthermore, the viability of cells without S-layer were reduced in simulated gastric juice at low pH range (2, 2.5, 3) and simulated pancreatic juice with bile salts (1.5 and 3 g l(-1)). S-layer proteins of L. acidophilus M92 were resistant to pepsin and pancreatin, in contrast, the treatment with proteinase K led to a significant proteolysis of the S-layer proteins. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated functional role of S-layer; it is responsible for adhesiveness of Lactobacillus acidophilus M92 to mouse ileal epithelial cells and has a protective role for this strain. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: S-layer proteins have an important role in the establishment of probiotic strain Lactobacillus acidophilus M92 in the gastrointestinal tract.
TI  - Lactobacillus suntoryeus sp. nov., isolated from malt whisky distilleries.
AB  - Eight strains of Lactobacillus with identical partial 16S rRNA gene sequences and similar randomly amplified polymorphic DNA patterns were isolated from fermentation samples from Japanese and Scottish malt whisky distilleries. Phylogenetic analysis of almost complete 16S rRNA gene sequences from three representative strains (two from Japan, one from Scotland) placed them in the genus Lactobacillus as members of the Lactobacillus acidophilus group. Lactobacillus helveticus and Lactobacillus gallinarum were the most closely related species, with 16S rRNA gene similarities of 99.3 and 98.1 %, respectively. A similar phylogeny was derived from partial sequences of elongation factor Tu (tuf) genes in which the alleles from the three distillery isolates were identical and shared 99.0 % similarity with L. helveticus and L. gallinarum tuf genes. S-layer (slp) gene sequences suggested different relationships among the strains and the distillery isolates no longer formed a monophyletic group. The alleles from the Japanese and Scottish strains shared only 54 % similarity. Chromosomal DNA from the distillery strains gave DNA-DNA hybridization values between 79 and 100 % but showed less than 43 and 22 % reassociation with L. helveticus and L. gallinarum DNA, respectively. The name Lactobacillus suntoryeus sp. nov. is proposed for this novel taxon; the type strain is strain SAT (=LMG 22464T=NCIMB 14005T).
TI  - Clinical effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus strain L-92 on perennial allergic rhinitis: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
AB  - Studies in animals have suggested that lactic acid bacteria alleviate allergic diseases, however, little information is available on their clinical effect on allergy in humans. Thus, we examined the efficacy of orally administered Lactobacillus acidophilus strain L-92 (L-92) on perennial allergic rhinitis. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 49 patients with perennial allergic rhinitis were randomized to receive either 100 mL of heat-treated fermented milk containing L-92 (n = 25) or acidified milk without lactic acid bacteria (placebo; n = 24) for 8 wk. The severity of symptoms was evaluated based on the changes in the scores of clinical symptoms. Oral administration of milk fermented with L-92 resulted in a statistically significant improvement of nasal symptom-medication scores. Ocular symptom-medication scores of patients in the L-92 intervention group tended to improve compared with those in the placebo group. In addition, clear decreases of the scores of swelling and color of the nasal mucosa were observed in the L-92 intervention group at 6 and 8 wk after the start of ingestion of fermented milk. There were no significant differences in serum antihouse dust mite immunoglobulin E levels nor in T helper type 1/T helper type 2 ratio between the 2 groups. These results suggest that oral administration of L-92 can alleviate the symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis, however, statistically significant changes were not shown in blood parameters.

TI  - Probiotication of tomato juice by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - This study was undertaken to determine the suitability of tomato juice as a raw material for production of probiotic juice by four lactic acid bacteria (Latobacillus acidophilus LA39, Lactobacillus plantarum C3, Lactobacillus casei A4, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii D7). Tomato juice was inoculated with a 24-h-old culture and incubated at 30 degrees C. Changes in pH, acidity, sugar content, and viable cell counts during fermentation under controlled conditions were measured. The lactic acid cultures reduced the pH to 4.1 or below and increased the acidity to 0.65% or higher, and the viable cell counts (CFU) reached nearly 1.0 to 9.0 x 10(9)/ml after 72 h fermentation. The viable cell counts of the four lactic acid bacteria in the fermented tomato juice ranged from 10(6) to 10(8) CFU/ml after 4 weeks of cold storage at 4 degrees C. Probiotic tomato juice could serve as a health beverage for vegetarians or consumers who are allergic to dairy products.
TI  - Comparative efficacy of dioctahedral smectite (Smecta) and a probiotic preparation in chronic functional diarrhoea.
AB  - The present study was designed to investigate the clinical efficacy and safety of dioctahedral smectite in Chinese patients with chronic functional diarrhoea and to compare this activity to a probiotic preparation. Patients diagnosed with chronic functional diarrhoea (Rome II criteria), exclusion of blood, ova/parasites in the stool and a normal colonoscopy were included. After a 1-week period of baseline without any medication, they were prescribed three sachets of dioctahedral smectite 3 g, administered 1 h after the meals (Group A), or two capsules of Bifico 210mg (Group B) for 28 consecutive days. Efficacy of the treatments was assessed on frequency of bowel movements and consistency of stool, as compared to baseline. Four hundred and ten patients were included (258 males, 152 females; mean age 43.8+/-13.9 years): 208 in Group A and 202 in Group B. In Group A, the mean number of stool per day decreased from 3.5+/-1.0 at baseline to 2.0+/-0.9 and from 3.3+/-1.0 to 2.2+/-0.9 in Group B (z = 2.699; P = 0.007). Decrease in stool number was significant with both treatments but more important with smectite at week 2 and remained significant throughout the treatment period. Stool consistency, assessed by the Bristol scale, also improved significantly over the treatment period, as compared to baseline (z = 3.310, P = 0.001). Dioctahedral smectite appeared in this study to be an effective and safe treatment of chronic functional diarrhoea, its effect starting during the first week of treatment and consisting in a decrease in the frequency of daily bowel movements and improvement of stool consistency. Moreover, dioctahedral smectite displays a prolonged action after disruption of the treatment that may interfere with the natural course of the disease.
TI  - Potential of selected lactic acid bacteria to produce food compatible antifungal  metabolites.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the potential of lactic acid bacteria to inhibit the outgrowth of some common food-spoiling fungi. Culture supernatants of 17 Lactic acid bacterial strains as well as of three commercial probiotic cultures were evaluated for antifungal activity using an agar-diffusion method. The method parameters were chosen in order to reveal compounds for potential use in food (bio)preservation. Thirteen strains showed antifungal activity of which five strains were very promising: Lactobacillus acidophilus LMG 9433, L. amylovorus DSM 20532, L. brevis LMG 6906, L. coryniformis subsp. coryniformis LMG 9196 and L. plantarum LMG 6907. Four of these five strains were further examined; it was found that the produced antifungal metabolites were pH-dependent. The exact chemical nature of these substances has not been revealed yet.
TI  - Effects of the administration of Lactobacilli on body growth and on the metabolic profile in growing Maltese goat kids.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of some lactobacilli on body growth and on the metabolic-nutritional status in growing goat kids. Twenty growing Maltese goat kids (10 Control and 10 Bios) were studied. The animals of the Bios group received a concentrate including 1 g x kg(-1) of SEB Bovino (spray-dried), Akron S.r.l., Italy, with non bacterial components: gum arabic, soybean meal, silicate alum of magnesium, and with bacterial components: 10(11) cfu kg(-1) each of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus reuteri. Monthly, bio-metric and weight evaluations were carried out on each animal and individual blood samples were taken. The Bios group showed the highest body weight (Control 19 vs. Bios 23 kg P < 0.001), anamorphosis (Control 71 vs. Bios 78 P < 0.05) and body proportion (Control 35 vs. Bios 41 P < 0.001) indices; the lowest levels of Non Esterified Fatty Acids (Control 0.778 vs. Bios 0.403 mmol L(-1) P < 0.001), triglycerides (Control 0.21 vs. Bios 0.18 mmol L(-1) P < 0.05), urea (Control 8.83 vs. Bios 7.65 mmol L(-1) P < 0.05) and the highest levels of Alkaline Phosphatase (Control 270 vs. Bios 851 U L(-1) P < 0.01) and Creatine Kinase (Control 173 vs. Bios 285 U L(-1) P < 0.01). The results testify to the better metabolic activity of the Bios group which achieved, at the end of the trial (7 months old), about 99% of the morphological development of the adult, therefore an adequate structure for mating and going into production within the first year of life.

TI  - Prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis with probiotics.
AB  
TI  - Oral probiotics reduce the incidence and severity of necrotizing enterocolitis in very low birth weight infants.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the efficacy of probiotics in reducing the incidence and  severity of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective, masked, randomized control trial was conducted to evaluate the beneficial effects of probiotics in reducing the incidence and severity of NEC among VLBW (<1500 g) infants. VLBW infants who started to fed enterally and survived beyond the seventh day after birth were eligible for the trial. They were randomized into 2 groups after parental informed consents were obtained. The infants in the study group were fed with Infloran (Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium infantis) with breast milk twice daily until discharged. Infants in the control group were fed with breast milk alone. The clinicians caring for the infants were blinded to the group assignment. The primary outcome was death or NEC (>or= stage 2). RESULTS: Three hundred sixty-seven infants were enrolled: 180 in the study group and 187 in the control group. The demographic and clinical variables were similar in both groups. The incidence of death or NEC (>or= stage 2) was significantly lower in the study group (9 of 180 vs 24 of 187). The incidence of NEC (>or= stage 2) was also significantly lower in the study when compared with the control group (2 of 180 vs 10 of 187). There were 6 cases of severe NEC (Bell stage 3) in the control group and none in the study group. None of the positive blood culture grew Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium species. CONCLUSION: Infloran as probiotics fed enterally with breast milk reduces the incidence and severity of NEC in VLBW infants.
TI  - Single-blind follow-up study on the effectiveness of a symbiotic preparation in irritable bowel syndrome.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Experimental and clinical studies have shown that a novel symbiotic (known as SCM-III) exerts a beneficial effect on gut translocation and local and systemic inflammatory and microbial metabolic parameters. The present investigation was a preliminary trial on the effectiveness of SCM-III for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: Sixty-eight consecutive adult patients with IBS who were free from lactose malabsorption, abdominal surgery, overt psychiatric disorders and ongoing psychotropic drug therapy or ethanol abuse were studied prospectively and divided into 2 groups that were comparable for age, gender, body size, education and pattern of presenting symptoms. The 2 groups were blindly given for 12 weeks either SCM-III 10 mL t.i.d or the same dosage of heat-inactivated symbiotic. RESULTS: Treatment with SCM-III was 'effective' or 'very effective' in more than 80% of the patients (P < 0.01 vs baseline values and control). Less than 5% reported 'not effective' as the final evaluation compared with over 40% of patients in the control group. After 6 weeks of treatment, a significant improvement of pain and bloating was reported in the treatment group compared with control and baseline values. There was also a benefit for bowel habits, mostly for patients with constipation or alternating bowel habits. No overt clinical or biochemical adverse side-effects were recorded. CONCLUSION: Compared with baseline values and the control group, SCM-III resulted in a significant increase in lactobacilla, eubacteria and bifidobacteria, which suggests that some selected IBS patients could benefit substantially from symbiotics, but the treatment may need to be given on a cyclic schedule because of the temporary modification of the fecal flora.
TI  - Intestinal microflora in patients with liver cirrhosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patients with liver cirrhosis have varying degrees of imbalance of the intestinal flora and probiotics can improve some of the symptoms of gastrointestinal dysfunction in these patients. In the present study, blood ammonia, fecal pH, fecal ammonia, and plasma endotoxin were measured after administration of two kinds of probiotics in order to detect the changes in intestinal flora. METHODS: Six bacteria and yeast were cultured and the colony forming units were counted. Fifty cirrhotic patients were randomized to receive probiotic capsules containing Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Enterococcus, or probiotic capsules containing Bacillus subtilis and Enterococcus faecium for 14 days. Fecal flora, pH and ammonia, blood ammonia (detected by test paper) and plasma endotoxin (detected by LAL test kits) were measured before and after the treatment. RESULTS: Patients with liver cirrhosis had varying degrees of imbalance of the intestinal flora as shown by a decrease in the Bifidobacterium count (10.04 +/- 0.78 vs 9.48 +/- 1.13, P < 0.05). The severity of the imbalance was matched by that of liver dysfunction, with the most serious imbalance observed in Child-Pugh C patients. Both types of probiotic increased the Bifidobacterium count (9.46 +/- 1.09 vs 10.30 +/- 1.11, 9.81 +/- 0.62 vs 10.44 +/- 1.08, respectively, P < 0.05) and reduced the levels of fecal pH and fecal and blood ammonia (P < 0.05). Probiotics containing B. subtilis and E. faecium reduced the level of endotoxin in cirrhotic patients with endotoxemia (0.0876 +/- 0.0117 Eu/mL vs 0.0685 +/- 0.0246 Eu/mL, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with liver cirrhosis have an imbalance of intestinal bacteria flora. Probiotics effectively increased the Bifidobacterium count and reduced the level of fecal pH and fecal and blood ammonia.
TI  - Pathogenic relevance of Lactobacillus: a retrospective review of over 200 cases.
AB  - Given that Lactobacillus has been reported to be the causative pathogen in many types of infection despite debate regarding the organism's clinical significance, a literature review was conducted to investigate the treatments and outcomes of Lactobacillus infections reported to date. In this article, the characteristics of over 200 reported cases of Lactobacillus-associated infections are summarized. Lactobacillus was found to be frequently associated with endocarditis and bacteremia. Lactobacillus was also associated with a variety of other infections including, but not limited to, peritonitis, abscesses, and meningitis. The species casei and rhamnosus were the most common. The isolates tended to be most sensitive to erythromycin and clindamycin and most resistant to vancomycin. The species that was most sensitive to vancomycin was acidophilus. The overall mortality rate was nearly 30%. There was a significant association between mortality and polymicrobial infection (P=0.004). In the subset of patients with bacteremia, increased mortality was associated with inadequate treatment (P=0.001) and polymicrobial bacteremia (P=0.044).
TI  - Coaggregation profiles of the microflora from root surface caries lesions.
AB  - Bacterial coaggregation reactions between different species and the auto aggregation of the same species are associated with the initiation and development of dental plaque and biofilms. As no such data is available on isolates from root caries lesions, we evaluated, by a visual, semi-quantitative scoring system and a spectrophotometric, quantitative assay, the coaggregation of 22 different wild-type microbial species comprising ten bacterial genera and a single Candida spp. The quantitative coaggregation assay we used proved to be a more sensitive method than the semi-quantitative, visual evaluation as the results yielded the percent coaggregation. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus bovis II/2 and Gemella morbillorum were observed having higher degrees of autoaggregation than the other examined strains. Significant levels of inter-species coaggregation was seen between: (1) Actinomyces spp. and Veillonella spp.; (2) Actinomyces israelii and Peptostreptococcus prevotii; (3) Campylobacter gracilis and Actinomyces spp.; (4) Prevotella intermedia and nine different species; and (5) Fusobacterium nucleatum and six other species. The single Candida albicans isolate did not coaggregate to a significant extent with any of the 21 bacterial isolates studied. Scanning electron microscopy observation of the coaggregation interactions between bacterial pairs having strong coaggregation reactions revealed varying adhesive patterns. Our findings on coaggregation amongst these isolates imply existence of multiple interactions between the coaggregation-inducing bacterial species in root caries. In particular, Actinomyces spp., Veillonella spp., Prevotella spp. and Fusobacterium spp. appear to play a significant role in this context.
TI  - Fermentation pH and temperature influence the cryotolerance of Lactobacillus acidophilus RD758.
AB  - The effects of 3 fermentation temperatures (30, 37, and 42 degrees C) and 3 fermentation pH (4.5, 5, and 6) on the cryotolerance of Lactobacillus acidophilus RD758 were studied in relation to their fatty acid composition. Cryotolerance was defined as the ability of the cells to recover their acidification activity after freezing and frozen storage at -20 degrees C. Better cryotolerance was obtained in cells grown at 30 degrees C or at pH 5; these cells showed no loss in acidification activity during freezing and a low rate of loss in acidification activity during frozen storage. On the other hand, cells grown at 42 degrees C or at pH 4.5 displayed poor cryotolerance. The membrane fatty acid composition was analyzed and related to the cryotolerance using principal component analysis. The improved cryotolerance observed during the freezing step was associated with a high ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids, a low C18:0 content, and high C16:0 and cyclic C19:0 relative concentrations. High resistance during frozen storage was related to a high cycC19:0 concentration. Finally, the low cryotolerance observed after fermentation at pH 4.5 was explained by a low C18:2 content.
TI  - Probiotic bacteria stimulate virus-specific neutralizing antibodies following a booster polio vaccination.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Orally ingested probiotic bacteria may modulate the immune response and increase antibody titers against enteric infections by bacteria or viruses. Even though positive effects of probiotics on respiratory tract infections have been reported, overall only few studies have examined effects on virus infections concerning organs other than the gastrointestinal tract. AIM OF THE STUDY: It was the aim of the study to investigate whether and how probiotics affect the immune response to a standardized enterovirus challenge (polio) and infections not limited to the gastrointestinal tract in healthy adults. METHODS: In a randomized, controlled and double-blind study 64 volunteers consumed for 5 weeks chemically acidified clotted milk without bacteria or with 10(10)/serving (Lactobacillus rhamnosus ) GG or Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL431 added. In the second week subjects were vaccinated orally against polio 1, 2 and 3. Polio virus neutralizing serum activity, the primary parameter, was determined by the standard neutralization test (WHO) before and three times after vaccination. Polio-specific IgA, IgG and IgM were detected by ELISAs. RESULTS: Probiotics increased poliovirus neutralizing antibody titers (NT) and affected the formation of poliovirus-specific IgA and IgG in serum. The maximum increase after immunization was about 2, 2.2, or 4-fold higher, respectively, for NT, IgG or, IgA, in volunteers consuming probiotics instead of placebo. No consistent difference was noted between bacterial strains. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics induce an immunologic response that may provide enhanced systemic protection of cells from virus infections by increasing production of virus neutralizing antibodies.
TI  - Probiotic consumption does not enhance the cholesterol-lowering effect of soy in  postmenopausal women.
AB  - Numerous studies report that soy lowers cholesterol. Probiotic bacteria were also reported to lower total cholesterol (TC) and LDL cholesterol (LDL-C). We hypothesized that by altering intestinal microflora, probiotic consumption may also change phytoestrogen metabolism and enhance the effects of soy. To evaluate the independent and interactive effects of probiotic bacteria and soy on plasma TC, LDL-C, HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides (TG), 37 women with a baseline TC of 5.24 mmol/L were given the following 4 treatments for 6 wk each in a randomized crossover design: soy protein isolate (26 +/- 5 g soy protein containing 44 +/- 8 mg isoflavones/d); soy protein isolate + probiotic capsules (10(9) colony-forming units Lactobacillus acidophilus DDS-1 and Bifidobacterium longum); milk protein isolate (26 +/- 5 g milk protein/d); and milk protein isolate + probiotic. Soy consumption decreased plasma TC by 2.2% (P = 0.02) and LDL-C by 3.5% (P = 0.005), increased HDL-C by 4.2% (P = 0.006) and tended to decrease TG (P = 0.07) compared with milk protein intake. When divided according to initial TC concentration, soy effects were observed only in hypercholesterolemic women (TC > 5.17 mmol/L). In this subgroup, soy treatments decreased plasma TC by 3.3% (P = 0.01), LDL-C by 4.5% (P = 0.004), and TG by 10.6% (P = 0.02), and increased HDL-C by 4.2% (P = 0.02). When subjects were divided on the basis of plasma and urine concentrations of the isoflavone metabolite, equol, equol producers and nonproducers did not differ in baseline lipids or in the effects of soy. Probiotics did not lower cholesterol or enhance the effects of soy. These results confirm a beneficial effect of soy on plasma cholesterol in mildly hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women independent of equol production status, but do not support an independent or additive effect of these particular probiotic bacteria.
TI  - The possible role of natural idiotopes in immune memory.
AB  - In this paper we report on the generation of Abs possessing specificities similar to those of Abs used in immunization, and on the generation of Id and anti-Id specificities in the sera of mice immunized with commensal bacterial antigens. The human monoclonal antibody IgM DJ (VH3/VL2) expresses natural antibody properties, natural idiotope (Y7), and specificity towards Lactic acid bacteria (LAB). When used in immunization it generates LAB-specific antibodies. Immunization with LAB, as detected in the presence of biotin-labelled mouse monoclonal anti-idiotopic antibodies Y7 and IgM DJ generates Abs1 and Abs2, respectively. These findings may imply that the recognition of bacterial motifs accords with the rules of idiotypic network theory. This theory, first proposed by Jerne in 1974 and often overlooked since, has been subject to change during the course of immunological research. Recent experiments concerning the recognition of bacterial motifs and natural memory in the immune system have inspired us in our attempt at explaining the possible role of natural Id in immune memory.
TI  - [Nutritional therapy in acute pancreatitis].
AB  - In this review, systematic search of literatures for acute pancreatitis and nutrition was performed. Eleven randomized controlled trials (RCT) were found. Eight of them are about parenteral or enteral nutrition, 2 are about immunomodulated nutrition, and one is nutritional method in postoperative period. None of these showed benefit of total parenteral nutrition. Moreover, enteral nutrition via nasojejunal tube after 1-2 days after onset or operation of acute pancreatitis showed safe and more effectiveness than parenteral nutrition even in severe cases. These results indicate no benefit of parenteral nutrition in mild to moderate pancreatitis. Early enteral nutrition via nasojejunal tube can be used even in severe cases without ileus or intestinal ischemia.
TI  - Suppressive effect of functional drinking yogurt containing specific egg yolk immunoglobulin on Helicobacter pylori in humans.
AB  - Helicobacter pylori is a human pathogen that infects over 50% of the population worldwide. It is the most important etiologic agent of gastroduodenal ulcers and malignancies. Helicobacter pylori urease enzyme is considered the main factor for the organism's colonization in the gastroduodenal mucosa. Hens immunized with the purified urease produce a highly specific anti-H. pylori urease immunoglobulin (IgY-urease) in their egg yolks. Immunoglobulin Y-urease was stable at 60 to 65 degrees C for 30 min and at pH 4.0 for 7 h. Its activity was lost at 80 degrees C for 20 min and at pH 2 for 4 h. Specially designed functional drinking yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium spp. with 1% egg yolk IgY-urease was produced commercially. Immunoglobulin Y-urease activity showed stability in the product up to 7 d, and then decreased to 85% after 3 wk of storage. A clinical study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of IgY-urease yogurt to suppress infection in humans. Forty-two volunteers who tested positive for H. pylori using a 13C-urea breath test were recruited. A total of 450 mL of IgY-urease (test group) or IgY-urease-free yogurt (control group) was consumed in 150-mL portions 3 times daily for 4 wk. Volunteers were tested after 2 and 4 wk; urea breath test values significantly decreased in the test group compared with the control group. The results indicate that suppression of H. pylori infection in humans could be achieved by consumption of drinking yogurt fortified with IgY-urease.
TI  - Molecular quantification of lactic acid bacteria in fermented milk products using real-time quantitative PCR.
AB  - Real-time quantitative PCR assays were developed for the absolute quantification  of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) (Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, L. casei, L. paracasei, L. rhamnosus, L. acidophilus and L. johnsonii) in fermented milk products. The results of molecular quantification and classic bacterial enumeration did not differ significantly with respect to S. thermophilus and the species of the L. casei group which were detected in the six commercial fermented products tested, thus showing that DNA extraction was efficient and that genomic DNA solutions were free of PCR inhibitors. For L. delbrueckii, the results of bacterial enumeration were generally lower by a factor 10 to 100 than those of PCR quantification, suggesting a loss of viability during storage of the dairy products at 1-8 degrees C for most of the strains in this species. Real-time quantitative assays enabled identification of the species of lactic acid bacterial strains initially present in commercial fermented milk products and their accurate quantification with a detection threshold of 10(3) cells per ml of product.
TI  - Identification and phenotypic characterization of the cell-division protein CdpA.
AB  - Analysis of the automated computer annotation of the early draft phase genome of  Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM revealed the previously discovered S-layer gene slpA and an additional partial ORF with weak similarities to S-layer proteins. The entire gene was sequenced to reveal a 1799-bp gene coding for 599 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 64.8 kDa. No transcription or translation signals could be determined in close proximity to the 5'-region. However, a strong putative terminator with a free energy of -16.84 kcal/mol was identified directly downstream of the gene. A PSI-Blast analysis showed similarities to members of S-layer proteins, cell-wall associated proteinases and hexosyl-transferases. Calculation of an unrooted phylogenetic tree with other examples of S-layer proteins and proteinases placed the deduced protein separately from both groups. A derivative of L. acidophilus NCFM was constructed by targeted integration into the gene. SDS-PAGE analysis of non-covalently linked proteins of the cell wall of the mutant, compared to the wild type, revealed the loss of a cell-surface protein. Phenotypic analyses of the mutant revealed significant changes in cell morphology, altered responses to various environmental stresses, and lowered cell adhesion. Based on the in silico and functional analyses, we ascertained that this protein plays a role in cell-wall processing during the growth and cell-cell separation and designated the gene as cell-division protein, cdpA.
TI  - Growth inhibition of foodborne pathogens and food spoilage organisms by select raw honeys.
AB  - Twenty-seven honey samples from different floral sources and geographical locations were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the growth of seven food spoilage organisms (Alcaligenes faecalis, Aspergillus niger, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Geotrichum candidum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Penicillium expansum, Pseudomonas fluorescens) and five foodborne pathogens (Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica Ser. Typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus) using an overlay inhibition assay. They were also tested for specific activity against S. aureus 9144 and B. stearothermophilus using the equivalent percent phenol test--a well diffusion assay corresponding to a dilute phenol standard curve. Honey inhibited bacterial growth due to high sugar concentration (reduced water activity), hydrogen peroxide generation, and proteinaceous compounds present in the honey. Some antibacterial activity was due to other unidentified components. The ability of honey to inhibit the growth of microorganisms varies widely, and could not be attributed to a specific floral source or demographic region produced in this study. Antibacterially active samples in this study included Montana buckwheat, tarweed, manuka, melaleuca, and saw palmetto. Furthermore, the bacteria were not uniformly affected by honey. Varying sensitivities to the antimicrobial properties were observed with four strains of S. aureus thus emphasizing the variability in the antibacterial effect of honey samples. Mold growth was not inhibited by any of the honeys tested. B. stearothermophilus, a heat-resistant spoilage bacteria, was shown to be highly sensitive to honey in both the overlay and well diffusion assays; other sensitive bacteria included A. faecalis and L. acidophilus. Non-peroxide antibacterial activity was observed in both assays; the highest instance was observed in the specific activity assay against B. stearothermophilus. Further research could indicate whether honey has potential as a preservative in minimally processed foods.
TI  - [Hydrogen peroxide produced by Lactobacillus species as a regulatory molecule for vaginal microflora].
AB  - A total of 33 strains of Lactobacillus belonging to 9 species, isolated from vagina, were tested for production of hydrogen peroxide. We observed that the following species: L. delbrueckii, L. acidophilus, L. crispatus, L. johnsonii and L. gasseri dominated over other species in secretion of hydrogen peroxide to the growth medium. Concentration of this substance amounted from 0.05 to 1.06 mM (in case of strong aeration the concentration increased up to 1.8 mM). Moreover, killing properties of the pure hydrogen peroxide exerted toward Escherichia coli and Candida albicans were less prominent than these of the supernatants of cultures of Lactobacillus strains producing H2O2.
TI  - [Adhesion of lactic acid bacteria to epithelium of different cavities of the human organism].
AB  - During investigation of adhesive properties of lactic acid bacteria it was found  out that 11 strains adhered to buccal intestinal and vaginal epithelium of human. The highest adhesive activity was detected in enterococci (adhesive index 7.75-14.26), lower one--in streptococci (6.40-9.16). In lactobacilli adhesive properties manifested in different ways: Lactobacillus acidophilus strains adhered more often to buccal epithelium (2.58-4.60) and rarely--to intestinal and vaginal. L. plantarum manifested high adhesive activity (8.03 -9.69) to buccal epithelium and lower one--to the rest of epithelium types. Monosaccharide composition of glycocalix of 6 strains of lactic acid bacteria was studied to understand the adhesion mechanism. It was shown that surface structures of this microorganism interact with plant lectins, specific to certain monosaccharides.
TI  - Real-time PCR detection of lactic acid bacteria in cecal contents of eimeria tenella-lnfected broilers fed soybean oligosaccharides and soluble soybean polysaccharides.
AB  - This experiment was conducted to test whether dietary soybean meal oligosaccharides (SMO) and water-soluble polysaccharides (SMP) can assist broiler chickens in resisting Eimeria tenella, and to determine the survival of lactic acid bacteria in cecal contents postinfection. All birds received a soybean meal-free diet. The 6 experimental treatments were as follows: positive (COR) and negative (COW) control groups, 2 groups fed diets containing either 1% SMO or 0.5% SMP from 1 to 11 d of age; a vaccinated group (VAC), and an anticoccidial medicated group (ANT). Chickens of all treatments except COW were orally infected with 1000 sporulated oocysts of E. tenella on d 15. Fecal oocyst shedding was monitored per treatment group between d 5 and 13 postinfection. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in cecal contents were evaluated by a real-time PCR technique on d 7 postinfection. The results showed that the SMO and SMP groups had a lower number of oocysts per gram of feces during the monitoring period than the COR group. Threshold cycles were 22.21, 27.68, 13.99, 14.92, 12.97, and 14.85, for COW, COR, SMO, SMP, VAC, and ANT groups, respectively; specific PCR products were confirmed by the results of melting curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis. The results suggest that these LAB communities were promoted by SMO and SMP and have a competitive exclusion function when broiler chickens are infected with E. tenella.
TI  - In vitro antibiotic susceptibility of lactobacilli isolated from commercial products containing active lactobacilli.
AB  - To survey the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of some commercially available Lactobacillus, we collected four commercial products that contain active Lactobacillus. We incubated individual product and identified these colonies by the methods of API50 CH test kit and RAPID ID 32A kit. Strains of Streptococcus thermophilus, Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei were collected. By agar dilution method, each identified strain was inoculated to Brucella blood agar-MIC plates. Each plate contained one of the following antibiotics with different concentrations: amoxicillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, vancomycin, erythromycin, rifampin, tetracyclin and penicillin G, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, cefmetazole, metronidazole, ampicillin/sulbactum, cefoxtin, etc. After incubation, the growth condition of each Brucella blood agar-MIC plate was observed and the breakpoint of each antibiotic to different Lactobacillus products determined. The MICs of amoxicillin, ampicillin/sulbactum and penicillin-G to all identified strains were < or =2 microg/ml and those of vancomycin, clindamycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, cefmetazole and cefoxtin for L. casei were >32 microg/ml. L. casei was more resistant to all the testing antibiotics than the other strains. According to the MICs of the above antibiotics, proper active lactobacillus products could be chosen to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea in the pediatric field.
TI  - Comparison of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase gene (fbp) sequences for the identification of Lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  - Comparative analysis of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase gene (fbp) sequences was evaluated for the differentiation of reference and clinical strains of Lactobacillus rhamnosus. The sequences of 1,971 nucleotides of the fbp gene were determined on both DNA strands for 21 L. rhamnosus strains, representing reference, probiotic, and clinical strains. No PCR amplification of the fbp gene was observed for other species of the Lactobacillus casei complex (L. casei and L. zeae) or strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Escherichia coli. Phylogenetic analysis of the fbp putative amino acid sequences of L. rhamnosus strains by the neighbor-joining method showed clear distinct positions of this species. The phylogenetic tree, derived from fbp nucleotide sequences, showed four clear divisions between strains of L. rhamnosus. From a taxonomic point of view, our results confirm for the first time that fbp gene sequences have high discriminating power for strains of L. rhamnosus that are difficult to differentiate.
TI  - Rapid identification of probiotic Lactobacillus species by multiplex PCR using species-specific primers based on the region extending from 16S rRNA through 23S rRNA.
AB  - This study aimed to develop a novel multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer set for the identification of seven probiotic Lactobacillus species such as Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. The primer set, comprising of seven specific and two conserved primers, was derived from the integrated sequences of 16S and 23S rRNA genes and their rRNA intergenic spacer region of each species. It was able to identify the seven target species with 93.6% accuracy, which exceeds that of the general biochemical methods. The phylogenetic analyses, using 16S rDNA sequences of the probiotic isolates, also provided further support that the results from the multiplex PCR assay were trustworthy. Taken together, we suggest that the multiplex primer set is an efficient tool for simple, rapid and reliable identification of seven Lactobacillus species.
TI  - In vitro growth, acidogenicity and cariogenicity of predominant human root caries flora.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans (Sm), Lactobacillus acidophilus (La) and Actinomyces israelii (Ai) have been associated with root surface caries, which is an increasing problem in elderly Chinese. The aim of this study therefore, was to evaluate in vitro, the growth, acidogenicity and cariogenicity of these organisms, both in mono- and co-cultures using an in vitro model. Forty-eight root specimens were prepared using intact extracted human molars. Fresh, wild-type bacteria obtained from root caries lesions were assembled into seven experimental groups as either mono- or co-cultures and incubated with the root specimens. Appropriate controls were included. Growth curve of each experimental group was monitored for 24h, aerobically, at 37 degrees C using a microplate reader. The pH of the medium was recorded after 24-h incubation using a pH meter. Mean depths of artificial root lesions produced in each cultural group were measured using polarized light microscopy in specimens cut into thin sections (100+/-20 microm). Compared with mono-cultures, synergistic growth was observed in co-cultures of 'La+Sm', 'Ai+La' and 'Ai+La+Sm'. Mean lesion depth produced in La group was significantly shallower than other mono- or co-culture groups (p<0.01). The pH values of all culture media were similar after 24-h incubation. The current data elucidate the complex interactions of three predominant bacterial species considered prime agents of human root surface caries.
TI  - [In vitro effect of carbohydrates and enteric bacteria on adherence of Candida albicans].
AB  - The adherence of Candida albicans to any cell is considered essential in the process that leads to colonization. Our objective in this study was to evaluate the effect of different carbohydrates and the presence of lactobacilli and Escherichia coli on the in vitro adherence of Candida albicans. The adherence to buccal epithelial cells was higher when growing at concentrations of galactose of 50, and 200 mM, as well as 50, 200, and 500 mM of sucrose, and 500 mM of mannose, compared with that obtained when growing in Sabouraud dextrose broth (p < 0.01). The presence of other microorganisms, such as Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. casei, caused a decrease in the in vitro adherence of C. albicans to buccal epithelial cells (p < 0.05), whereas E. coli did not modify this adherence at all.
TI  - Probiotics reduce bacterial colonization and gastric inflammation in H. pylori-infected mice.
AB  - Probiotics are characterized by their ability to interact with commensal microflora in the gastrointestinal tract to produce beneficial health effects. In vitro studies suggest that Lactobacillus species have the potential to suppress the growth of Helicobacter pylori. The goal of this study was to determine if pretreatment of mice with a commercial mixture of live probiotics (L. rhamnosus, strain R0011, and L. acidophilus, strain R0052) would suppress colonization of H. pylori, strain SS1. Thirty C57BL/6 female mice were divided into four groups: Group A was fed sterile water, group B received probiotics in sterile drinking water, group C was challenged orogastrically with H. pylori, and group D was pretreated with probiotics in drinking water prior to and following challenge with H. pylori. Rectal swabs, stomach homogenates, and luminal contents from ileum and colon were plated onto colistin nalidixic acid plates. Serial dilutions of stomach homogenates were plated onto H. pylori-sensitive agar plates and incubated under microaerophilic conditions. Tissue samples from the stomach were analyzed histologically to determine the degree of H. pylori colonization, mucosal inflammation, and epithelial cell apoptosis. Probiotics in drinking water did not affect the overall well-being of mice. Lactobacillus species were excreted in stools over the entire duration of treatment. Pretreatment with probiotics reduced the number of mice with H. pylori growth from stomach homgenates (100 to 50%; P = 0.02). The percentage of mice with moderate-severe H. pylori-induced inflammation in the gastric antrum was reduced with probiotic pretreatment (71 to 29%; P = 0.14). However, pretreatment with probiotics did not prevent H. pylori-induced apoptosis in the gastric mucosa. This preparation of probiotics provided a safe and novel approach for reducing H. pylori colonization and bacterial-induced inflammation of mice.

TI  - Role of viability of probiotic strains in their persistence in the gut and in mucosal immune stimulation.
AB  - AIMS: To determine how probiotic bacteria contact with intestinal epithelial and  immune cells and the conditions to induce a good mucosal immune stimulation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lactobacillus casei was studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to determine its interaction with the gut. We compared the influence of viable and nonviable lactic acid bacteria on the intestinal mucosal immune system (IMIS) and their persistence in the gut of mice. TEM showed whole Lact. casei adhered to the villi; the bacterial antigen was found in the cytoplasm of the enterocytes. Viable bacteria stimulated the IMIS to a greater extent than nonviable bacteria with the exception of Lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. For all the strains assayed at 72 h no antigenic particles were found in the intestine. CONCLUSION: Antigenic particles but not the whole bacteria can enter to epithelial cells and contact with the immune cells. Bacterial viability is a condition for a better stimulation of the IMIS. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: We demonstrated that only antigenic particle interact with the immune cells and their fast clearance from the gut agrees with those described for the particulate antigens. The regular consumption of probiotics should not adversely affect the host.

TI  - Study of a hydraulic calcium phosphate cement for dental applications.
AB  - Calcium phosphate-based cements (CPCs) have attracted much interest because of their good osteoconductivity for bone reconstruction. We obtained CPCs by mixing calcium bis-dihydrogenophosphate monohydrate (MCPM) and calcium oxide with water or sodium phosphate buffers (NaP) as liquid phase. Cement samples with different calcium-to-phosphate ratios (Ca/P), liquid-to-powder ratios (L/P) and liquid phases were analyzed by X-rays diffraction (XRD), pH-metry, extensometry and calorimetry. Antibacterial activity on two bacterial strains (Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus) and a polycontaminated bacterial inoculum was also studied using the agar diffusion method. The best mechanical properties (approximately 25 MPa) corresponded to Ca/P ratios between 1.67 and 2.5, a 1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7, as liquid phase and a L/P ratio of 0.6ml g(-1). The final setting time increased with the Ca/P ratio. The setting expansion, around 1-2%, depended on the Ca/P and L/P ratios. The inner temperature of the cements rose to 45 degrees during setting then decreased rapidly. The injectability was 100% up to 3.5 min and then decreased. It increased with increasing the L/P ratio but to the detriment of the compressive strength and setting time. XRD analysis indicated that the setting reaction led to a mixture of calcium hydroxide and calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite even for a Ca/P ratio of 1.67. Consequently, the pH of the surrounding fluids rose to 11.5-12 during their dissolution. Bacterial growth inhibition was only clearly observed for Ca/P>or=2. This bioactive calcium phosphate cement can potentially be employed for pulp capping and cavity lining as classical calcium hydroxide-based cements, but it is not usable, in the present formulation, for root canal filling because of its short setting time.
TI  - Identification and inactivation of genetic loci involved with Lactobacillus acidophilus acid tolerance.
AB  - Amino acid decarboxylation-antiporter reactions are one of the most important systems for maintaining intracellular pH between physiological limits under acid stress. We analyzed the Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM complete genome sequence and selected four open reading frames with similarities to genes involved with decarboxylation reactions involved in acid tolerance in several microorganisms. Putative genes encoding an ornithine decarboxylase, an amino acid permease, a glutamate gamma-aminobutyrate antiporter, and a transcriptional regulator were disrupted by insertional inactivation. The ability of L. acidophilus to survive low-pH conditions, such as those encountered in the stomach or fermented dairy foods, was investigated and compared to the abilities of early- and late-stationary-phase cells of the mutants by challenging them with a variety of acidic conditions. All of the integrants were more sensitive to low pH than the parental strain. Interestingly, each integrant also exhibited an adaptive acid response during logarithmic growth, indicating that multiple mechanisms are present and orchestrated in L. acidophilus in response to acid challenge.
TI  - Salivary IgA to cariogenic bacteria in HIV-positive children and its correlation  with caries prevalence and levels of cariogenic microorganisms.
AB  - The interrelationship of HIV infection, dental caries and mucosal immune responses remains controversial. In our study population of 40 HIV-infected and 40 healthy control children (ages 2-5 years) there was a significantly higher prevalence of dental caries in HIV-infected children (P<0.05). The extent of caries correlated with the severity of HIV disease. To determine whether the immunosuppression that ensues after HIV infection could contribute to the increased caries prevalence, the concentrations of total IgA and IgA specific to cariogenic bacteria (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus and Lactobacillus acidophilus) were determined in whole saliva by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Levels of the same bacteria were also quantified in saliva using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. A significantly increased level of total salivary IgA was found in the HIV-positive population (P < 0.05), but there were comparable titers of specific IgA to cariogenic bacteria in HIV-positive and healthy controls. The microbiological assessment also demonstrated similar levels of cariogenic microorganisms in both groups. We conclude that HIV-positive children appear to maintain the capacity to mount a mucosal immune response to cariogenic microorganisms, at least until late stages of disease.
TI  - Stimulatory effects of casein phosphopeptide (CPP-III) on mRNA expression of cytokines in Caco-2 cells.
AB  - The effect of CPP-III, a commercially available casein phosphopeptide, on the mRNA expression of cytokines in Caco-2 cells was investigated. CPP-III enhanced the mRNAs of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha while IL-1beta was not affected. The mRNA expression of IL-6 was stronger in the presence of both CPP-III and bacterial components such as peptidoglycan from Lactobacillus acidophilus and lipopolysaccharide from Salmonella typhimurium. These results suggest that CPP-III influences the expression of cytokines in intestinal epithelial cells.
TI  - Effects of ingesting Lactobacillus- and Bifidobacterium-containing yogurt in subjects with colonized Helicobacter pylori.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that ingesting lactic acid bacteria exerts a suppressive effect on Helicobacter pylori infection in both animals and humans. Supplementing with Lactobacillus- and Bifidobacterium-containing yogurt (AB-yogurt) was shown to improve the rates of eradication of H. pylori in humans. OBJECTIVE: We administered AB-yogurt to subjects with asymptomatic H. pylori to test whether the yogurt could inhibit H. pylori growth. DESIGN: The in vitro inhibition of H. pylori growth was determined by inoculating Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 or Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 on plates that were inoculated with H. pylori. Assessment of the viability of H. pylori was performed by the mixed culture method with La5 or Bb12. In an intervention study, 59 adult volunteers infected with H. pylori were given AB-yogurt (10(7) colony-forming units of both La5 and Bb12/mL) twice daily after a meal for 6 wk. Eleven subjects positive for H. pylori infection were treated with milk placebo as control subjects. H. pylori bacterial loads were determined with use of the (13)C-urea breath test, which was performed before and 4 and 8 wk after the start of AB-yogurt supplementation. RESULTS: Bb12 exerted an in vitro inhibitory effect against H. pylori, whereas La5 did not show an effect. Administration of AB-yogurt decreased the urease activity of H. pylori after 6 wk of therapy (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Regular intake of yogurt containing Bb12 and La5 effectively suppressed H. pylori infection in humans.
TI  - Influence of synbiotic containing Lactobacillus acidophilus La5, Bifidobacterium  lactis Bb 12, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and oligofructose on gut barrier function and sepsis in critically ill patients: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Infective complications are a common cause of mortality and morbidity in critically ill patients. Many factors affect sepsis, one of which is gut barrier function. The aim of this study was to determine whether the oral administration of a synbiotic preparation could alter gut barrier function in critically ill patients and thus reduce sepsis. METHODS: A total of 90 patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) were randomised to receive either synbiotic or placebo preparations (45 into each group). The synbiotic preparation consisted of Lactobacillus acidophilus La5, Bifidobacterium lactis Bb 12, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus (probiotics) with oligofructose (prebiotic). Gut barrier function was assessed by measurement of intestinal permeability (lactulose/rhamnose test) and culture of nasogastric aspirate on days 1 and 8. All septic complications and mortality were recorded. RESULTS: There were no differences between the groups in terms of age, sex, APACHE II or POSSUM scores. After 1 week of therapy, patients in the synbiotic group had a significantly lower incidence of potentially pathogenic bacteria (43% versus 75%, P = 0.05) and multiple organisms (39% versus 75%, P = 0.01) in their nasogastric aspirates than controls. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of intestinal permeability, septic complications or mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of synbiotic in critically ill patients favourably altered the microbial composition of the upper gastrointestinal tract but had no effect on intestinal permeability and was not associated with measurable clinical benefit.
TI  - Expression of a heterologous manganese superoxide dismutase gene in intestinal lactobacilli provides protection against hydrogen peroxide toxicity.
AB  - In living organisms, exposure to oxygen provokes oxidative stress. A widespread mechanism for protection against oxidative stress is provided by the antioxidant enzymes: superoxide dismutases (SODs) and hydroperoxidases. Generally, these enzymes are not present in Lactobacillus spp. In this study, we examined the potential advantages of providing a heterologous SOD to some of the intestinal lactobacilli. Thus, the gene encoding the manganese-containing SOD (sodA) was cloned from Streptococcus thermophilus AO54 and expressed in four intestinal lactobacilli. A 1.2-kb PCR product containing the sodA gene was cloned into the shuttle vector pTRK563, to yield pSodA, which was functionally expressed and complemented an Escherichia coli strain deficient in Mn and FeSODs. The plasmid, pSodA, was subsequently introduced and expressed in Lactobacillus gasseri NCK334, Lactobacillus johnsonii NCK89, Lactobacillus acidophilus NCK56, and Lactobacillus reuteri NCK932. Molecular and biochemical analyses confirmed the presence of the gene (sodA) and the expression of an active gene product (MnSOD) in these strains of lactobacilli. The specific activities of MnSOD were 6.7, 3.8, 5.8, and 60.7 U/mg of protein for L. gasseri, L. johnsonii, L. acidophilus, and L. reuteri, respectively. The expression of S. thermophilus MnSOD in L. gasseri and L. acidophilus provided protection against hydrogen peroxide stress. The data show that MnSOD protects cells against hydrogen peroxide by removing O(2)(.-) and preventing the redox cycling of iron. To our best knowledge, this is the first report of a sodA from S. thermophilus being expressed in other lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - [Treatment of acute diarrhea: prescription patterns by private practice pediatricians].
AB  - Acute gastroenteritis remains a frequent illness in infants and children with still important morbidity and mortality rates. Oral rehydratation solutions (ORS) and early refeeding are the main recommendations. Indication of drugs remains limited. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the management of acute diarrhea by private practice pediatricians of France. METHODS: A questionnaire concerning ORS, dietary formula, antidiarrheal diet, antibiotherapy, antidiarrheal drugs was sent to all 2907 private pediatricians of France. RESULTS: Six hundred twenty-nine questionnaires were analyzed (22%). Three hundred and ninety-seven pediatricians (63%) prescribed systematically an ORS, 294 (47%) changed formula, 412 (66%) prescribed a regimen. Antibiotic was prescribed after coproculture (81%), when glairy and bloody diarrhea (65%), associated infectious disease (63%), toxi-infectious syndrome (42%) or immunodeficiency were present (28%). Most pediatricians (97%) prescribed at least one drug: diosmectite (84%), Lactobacillus acidophilus (63%), Saccharomyces boulardii (62%), racecadotril (62%), loperamide (28%), attapulgite de Mormoiron (26%), nifuroxazide (20%). Drugs were prescribed more often for their effectiveness than for comfort. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the discrepancies that remain between recommendations and practical care in the treatment of acute diarrhea in children. Private French pediatricians often prescribe drugs.
TI  - Metabolic activities of Lactobacillus spp. strains isolated from kefir.
AB  - A total of 21 strains of Lactobacillus species were isolated from Turkish kefir samples, in order to select the most suitable strains according to their metabolic activities including probiotic properties. As a result of the identification tests, 21 Lactobacillus isolates were identified as L. acidophilus (4%), L. helveticus (9%), L. brevis (9%), L. bulgaricus (14%), L. plantarum (14%), L. casei (19%) and L. lactis (28%). The amount of produced lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, proteolytic activity, and acetaldehyde productions of Lactobacillus spp. were determined. Different amounts of lactic acid were produced by strains studies; however, lactic acid levels were 1.7-11.4 mg/mL. All strains produced hydrogen peroxide. L. bulgaricus Z14L strain showed no proteolytic activity, L. casei Z6L strain produced the maximum amount (0.16 mg/mL) of proteolytic activity. Acetaldehyde concentration produced in Lactobacillus strains ranged between 0.88-3.52 microg/mL.
TI  - Bacteria in the gut: friends and foes and how to alter the balance.
AB  - The activities of the bacteria resident in the colon of companion animals can have an impact upon the health of the host. Our understanding of this microbial ecosystem is presently increasing due to the development of DNA-based microbiological tools that allow identification and enumeration of nonculturable microorganisms. These techniques are changing our view of the bacteria that live in the gut, and they are facilitating dietary-intervention approaches to modulate the colonic ecosystem. This is generally achieved by the feeding of either live bacteria (probiotics) or nondigestible oligosaccharides (prebiotics) that selectively feed the indigenous probiotics. Feeding studies with a Lactobacillus acidophilus probiotic have shown positive effects on carriage of Clostridium spp. in canines and on recovery from Campylobacter spp. infection in felines. Immune function was improved in both species. Prebiotic feeding studies with lactosucrose and fructo-oligosaccharides in both cats and dogs have shown positive effects on the microflora balance. Recently synbiotic forms (a probiotic together with a prebiotic) targeted at canines have been developed that show promise as dietary-intervention tools.
TI  - Plasma phytoestrogens are not altered by probiotic consumption in postmenopausal  women with and without a history of breast cancer.
AB  - Soy phytoestrogens were suggested to reduce the risk of a number of diseases including breast cancer. Given that these compounds are metabolized by bacteria, alteration of intestinal bacteria and enzymes may affect phytoestrogen metabolism. We hypothesized that probiotics, when consumed with soy protein, would increase plasma isoflavones, as well as equol producer frequency, in postmenopausal women. We further hypothesized that these effects would differ between women who have had breast cancer and women who have not. To test these hypotheses, 20 breast cancer survivors and 20 controls completed four 6-wk treatments in a randomized, crossover design: supplementation with soy protein (S) (26.6 +/- 4.5 g protein, 44.4 +/- 7.5 mg isoflavones/d); soy + probiotics (S+P) (10(9) colony-forming units Lactobacillus acidophilus DDS+1 and Bifidobacterium longum, 15-30 mg fructooligosaccharide/d); milk protein (M) (26.6 +/- 4.5 g protein/d); and milk + probiotics (M+P). Plasma phytoestrogen concentrations did not differ between controls and survivors, although genistein tended to be lower in survivors at baseline (P = 0.15), and during soy (P = 0.16) and milk protein (P = 0.16) consumption. As expected, soy consumption increased plasma phytoestrogen concentrations (P < 0.0001). Plasma phytoestrogen concentrations and the number of equol producers did not differ between the S and S+P diets. At the same time, plasma equol concentrations as well as urinary equol excretion in 2 subjects were more than 7-fold different between the 2 diets. These results indicate that this particular probiotic supplement does not generally affect plasma isoflavones, although the large differences between plasma and urinary equol in some subjects suggest that equol producer status may be modifiable in some individuals.
TI  - Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium colonization of the crop in the domestic  turkey: influence of probiotic and prebiotic treatment (Lactobacillus acidophilus and lactose).
AB  - Acute colonization of the crop of the domestic turkey by Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (ST) was examined. The influences of preharvest probiotic and prebiotic treatment with lactobaccilli and lactose on crop colonization with ST were also investigated. Prior to Salmonella challenge, poults received 2.5% lactose and Lactobacillus acidophilus (1.9 x 10(9) organisms/liter) in the only source of drinking water from 1 day old to termination. At 3-wk-old, turkey poults were challenged with ST (1.7 X 10(8) colony-forming units [CFU]/ml) before their natural nocturnal fast to determine the potential effects of supplementation on crop colonization when the crop was engorged and subsequently undergoing emptying. Crop ingesta and tissue were collected at time points 30 min and 4, 8, and 24 hr postchallenge and ST levels were determined. High levels of ST were detected in the crop. For instance, for the poults not receiving lactose or lactobacilli, 30 min after ST challenge, there were 4.4 x 10(7) CFU in the crop ingesta and 5.3 x 10(5) CFU in the crop wall. Ingesta ST levels dropped dramatically to 1.0 x 10(6) CFU after 4 hr as the crop emptied. Crop wall ST levels were steady during the nocturnal crop evacuation. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated ST in close association with the crop epithelium. Treatment with lactose and L. acidophilus supplementation did not reduce ST colonization.
TI  - Efficient prematurity prevention is possible by pH-self measurement and immediate therapy of threatening ascending infection.
AB  - In two prospective investigations, the effectiveness of the self care programme for prematurity prevention, developed by Saling, was investigated. Pregnant women in Erfurt have been offered to perform self measurements of their vaginal pH by means of test gloves twice a week in order to screen for any disturbances in the vaginal milieu. The women were instructed to see their physician immediately, if abnormal pH > or = 4.7 or other risk factors were present, in order to get them confirmed and to start lactobacillus acidophilus therapy or in case of bacterial vaginosis to treat with clindamycin cream i. vag. Patients who were not interested in the programme served as a control group. Seventy-three out of 381 women in the intervention group have been identified as risk cases. Fifty-eight of them were treated with a lactobacillus preparation, and 24 with clindamycin cream, three patients refused to have any therapy. In this study, the prematurity rate was 8.1% in the self measurement/intervention group versus 12.3% in the control group (P < 0.05, n = 2341). 0.3% versus 3.3% of the neonates belonged to the group of very early prematures with a gestational age of <32 + 0 (P < 0.01). PROM was registered in 22.8% versus 30.8% (P < 0.001), respectively. Starting 1 March 2000, a similar statewide pH screening programme was initiated in order to reduce prematurity in the State of Thuringia. According to the study design, a significant decrease of prematurity was hypothetically expected for the second half of 2000. In Erfurt, an overall decrease of prematurity from 7.68 to 6.81% and a reduction of cases < or = 32 weeks from 3.22 to 2.39% was observed. Premature rupture of membranes was seen in 19 versus 0 pregnancies with early prematurity (n = 1600). Data from 16,276 women are available for the state of Thuringia. On this basis, a significant reduction of early prematurity from 1.58 to 0.99% was seen, respectively (P < 0.001). Comparing low birthweights a significant reduction of cases was achieved as well in all groups. On the basis of the data obtained we recommend the extension of the campaign in whole of Germany.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of lactobacilli from some traditional fermented foods and evaluation of the bacteriocins.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) commonly used in food as starter cultures are known to produce antimicrobial substances such as bacteriocins and have great potential as food biopreservatives. LAB isolated from traditional fermented foods (appam batter and pickles) were screened for bacteriocin production. Two lactobacilli, LABB and LABP (one from each source) producing bacteriocins were characterized. Both the bacilli were homo-fermentative, catalase negative and micro-aerophilic in nature. LABB was found to be a thermobacterium growing at 45 degrees C while LABP was a streptobacterium growing at 15 degrees C. Both were able to grow at pH 4.5-8.6 but were intolerant to high salt concentration. They failed to produce gas from glucose as well as ammonia from arginine. Among the sugars examined they could not ferment arabinose, raffinose, rhamnose or xylose. Additionally, LABB could not ferment esculin, gluconate or mannose. LABB is identified as Lactobacillus acidophilus while LABP as Lb. casei. Their bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory spectrum against the indicator organisms tested. They were active below pH 8.0 and after autoclaving as well. There was a complete loss of activity when treated with proteolytic enzymes such as trypsin indicating the proteinaceous nature of the active molecules. SDS-PAGE of partially purified bacteriocins indicated the molecular mass of the bacteriocin as 3.8 and 4.5 kDa for LABB and LABP respectively.
TI  - Isolation, identification and characterisation of the dominant microorganisms of  kule naoto: the Maasai traditional fermented milk in Kenya.
AB  - From 22 samples of kule naoto, the traditional fermented milk products of the Maasai in Kenya, 300 lactic acid bacterial strains were isolated and phenotypically characterised by their ability to ferment different carbohydrates and by additional biochemical tests. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB), especially the genus Lactobacillus, followed by Enterococcus, Lactococcus and Leuconostoc, dominated the microflora of these samples. The major Lactobacillus species was Lactobacillus plantarum (60%), with a lower frequency of isolation for Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus paracasei and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Most strains produced enzymes such as beta-galactosidase and peptidases, which are of relevance to cultured dairy product processing, and exhibited similar patterns of enzymatic activity between species. Enterobacteriaceae could not be detected in 15 out of 22 samples (detection level 10(2)/ml). Conversely, yeasts (detection level 10(1)/ml) were detected in those samples in which Enterobacteriaceae were not found. The pH values of all these samples were < 4.5.
TI  - Specific response of a novel and abundant Lactobacillus amylovorus-like phylotype to dietary prebiotics in the guts of weaning piglets.
AB  - Using 16S rRNA gene-based approaches, we analyzed the responses of ileal and colonic bacterial communities of weaning piglets to dietary addition of four fermentable carbohydrates (inulin, lactulose, wheat starch, and sugar beet pulp). An enriched diet and a control diet lacking these fermentable carbohydrates were fed to piglets for 4 days (n = 48), and 10 days (n = 48), and the lumen-associated microbiota were compared using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of amplified 16S rRNA genes. Bacterial diversities in the ileal and colonic samples were measured by assessing the number of DGGE bands and the Shannon index of diversity. A higher number of DGGE bands in the colon (24.2 +/- 5.5) than in the ileum (9.7 +/- 4.2) was observed in all samples. In addition, significantly higher diversity, as measured by DGGE fingerprint analysis, was detected in the colonic microbial community of weaning piglets fed the fermentable-carbohydrate-enriched diet for 10 days than in the control. Selected samples from the ileal and colonic lumens were also investigated using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and cloning and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. This revealed a prevalence of Lactobacillus reuteri in the ileum and Lactobacillus amylovorus-like populations in the ileum and the colon in the piglets fed with fermentable carbohydrates. Newly developed oligonucleotide probes targeting these phylotypes allowed their rapid detection and quantification in the ileum and colon by FISH. The results indicate that addition of fermentable carbohydrates supports the growth of specific lactobacilli in the ilea and colons of weaning piglets.
TI  - Growth-promoting effects of lactoferrin on L. acidophilus and Bifidobacterium spp.
AB  - We investigated the effects of lactoferrin on the growth of L. acidophilus CH-2,  Bifidobacterium breve ATCC 15700, B. longum ATCC 15707, B. infantis ATCC 15697, and B. bifidum ATCC 15696. The growth of L. acidophilus was stimulated by bovine holo-lactoferrin but not by apo-lactoferrin. With bifidobacteria, bovine lactoferrin stimulated growth of three strains: B. breve, B. infantis and B. bifidum under certain conditions. Both apoprotein and holoprotein had similar effects. However, B. longum growth was not affected by lactoferrin. Thus, the mechanism of stimulating growth of bifidobacteria may be different from that of L. acidophilus. By far-western blotting using biotinylated lactoferrin and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin, lactoferrin-binding proteins were detected in the membrane protein fraction of L. acidophilus, B. bifidum, B. infantis and B. breve. The molecular weights of lactoferrin-binding proteins of L. acidophilus were estimated from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to be 27, 41 and 67 kDa, and those of the three bifidobacterial strains were estimated to be 67-69 kDa. However, no such lactoferrin-binding components were detected in the membrane fraction of B. longum. It is interesting that the appearance of lactoferrin-binding proteins in the membrane fraction of these species corresponds to their growth stimulation by lactoferrin.
TI  - Bacteriotherapy using fecal flora: toying with human motions.
AB  - The intestinal flora may play a key role in the pathogenesis of certain gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. Components of bowel flora such as Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidus have long been used empirically as therapeutic agents for GI disorders. More complex combinations of probiotics for therapeutic bacteriotherapy have also recently become available, however the most elaborate mix of human-derived probiotic bacteria is, by definition, the entire fecal flora. Fecal bacteriotherapy uses the complete normal human flora as a therapeutic probiotic mixture of living organisms. This type of bacteriotherapy has a longstanding history in animal health and has been used sporadically against chronic infections of the bowel, especially as a treatment of last resort for patients with severe Clostridium difficile syndromes including recurrent diarrhea, colitis, and pseudomembranous colitis. Encouraging results have also been observed following infusions of human fecal flora in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic constipation. The therapeutic use of fecal bacteriotherapy is reviewed here and possible mechanisms of action and potential applications explored. Published reports on fecal bacteriotherapy are few in number, and detail the results of small uncontrolled open studies and case reports. Nevertheless, given the promising clinical responses, formal research into fecal bacteriotherapy is now warranted.
TI  - Probiotics in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.
AB  - Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) may be diagnosed on the presence of symptoms, according to Rome II criteria, [corrected] and some studies have shown that abnormal colonic fermentation may be an important factor in the development of symptoms in some patients with IBS. Since the fermentation [corrected] of substrates by the intestinal flora may play a key role in the use of probiotics in the treatment of IBS, seventy [corrected] patients (31 [corrected] males, 39 [corrected] females), mean age 40 years (range = 26-64 years) with IBS, according to Rome II criteria, were enrolled into the study after informed consensus. Patients were randomly assigned to receive for 4 weeks [corrected] either the active preparation containing Lactobacillus plantarum LP 01 [corrected] and Bifidobacterium breve BR 03 [corrected] or Lactobacillus plantarum LP 01 and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA 02, all strains at concentrations of 5 x 10(9) CFU/g) [corrected] or placebo powder containing starch identical to the study product [corrected] To evaluate treatment efficacy two different scores were considered [corrected] Pain score in different abdominal locations after treatment decreased in probiotics groups A and B 42% and 49% versus 25% [corrected] (P < 0.05) in [corrected] placebo group after 14 days and 45% and 49% versus 29.5% [corrected] (P < 0.001) after 28 days. The severity score of characteristic IBD symptoms significantly decreased in probiotic groups A and B [corrected] versus placebo group after 14 days, 49.3% and 55.6% [corrected] versus 8% [corrected] (P < 0.001), and these data were confirmed after 28 days (56% and 55.6% versus 14.4% [corrected] P < 0.001). In conclusion, short-term therapy with Lactobacillus plantarum LP 01 and Bifidobacterium breve BR 03 or Lactobacillus plantarum LP 01 and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA 02 [corrected] may be considered a promising approach for IBS therapy [corrected]
TI  - In vitro inhibition of Eimeria tenella invasion by indigenous chicken Lactobacillus species.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the effects of indigenous chicken Lactobacillus species isolates from different parts of the gastrointestinal tract on Eimeria tenella invasion in vitro and to characterise the nature of inhibition, if any. The effects of competitive exclusion, steric interference and bacterial extracellular factors on E. tenella invasion were examined in an MDBK cell model. Several Lactobacillus species were initially isolated from chickens and identified by biochemical characteristics and 16S-rRNA. All Lactobacillus species isolates tested, significantly inhibited E. tenella invasion. Steric interference did not affect parasite invasion. Extracellular metabolic factors secreted by Lactobacillus species isolates into the surrounding media were shown to inhibit parasite invasion and these factors appeared to be heat stable. These results show that the natural microflora of poultry can provide a source of E. tenella-inhibiting Lactobacillus species in vitro, and thus may contribute to the control of Eimeria infection.
TI  - Vaginal lactobacilli in adolescents: presence and relationship to local and systemic immunity, and to bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to survey middle adolescents for the presence of vaginal lactobacilli, lactobacilli-specific immune sensitization, and correlates of vaginal immunity with lactobacilli and bacterial vaginosis (BV). METHODS: A cohort of 89 female adolescents were evaluated for the presence of vaginal lactobacilli species, H2O2-producing species, and the prevalence of BV. Cytokines and antibodies in cervicovaginal lavages were detected and peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) responses to Lactobacillus crispatus were evaluated. RESULTS: The majority of lactobacillus species were H2O2-producing and predominated by Lactobacillus acidophilus. PBL responses to lactobacilli were detectable in 50% of the cohort. BV was present in 36% of adolescents and negatively correlated with the presence of vaginal lactobacilli. The majority of locally associated cytokines and antibodies were similar in those with or without BV or lactobacilli. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents harbor vaginal lactobacilli with relationships to BV along with lactobacilli-specific immune sensitization, but with few correlates of local immunity to lactobacilli or BV.
TI  - Consumption of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium longum do not alter  urinary equol excretion and plasma reproductive hormones in premenopausal women.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To confirm the results of an earlier study showing premenopausal equol excretors to have hormone profiles associated with reduced breast cancer risk, and to investigate whether equol excretion status and plasma hormone concentrations can be influenced by consumption of probiotics. DESIGN: A randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm trial. SUBJECTS: In all, 34 of the initially enrolled 37 subjects completed all requirements. INTERVENTION: All subjects were followed for two full menstrual cycles and the first seven days of a third cycle. During menstrual cycle 1, plasma concentrations of estradiol (E(2)), estrone (E(1)), estrone-sulfate (E(1)-S), testosterone (T), androstenedione (A), dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEA-S), and sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) were measured on cycle day 2, 3, or 4, and urinary equol measured on day 7 after a 4-day soy challenge. Subjects then received either probiotic capsules (containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium longum) or placebo capsules through day 7 of menstrual cycle 3, at which time both the plasma hormone concentrations and the post-soy challenge urinary equol measurements were repeated. RESULTS: During menstrual cycle 1, equol excretors and non-excretors were not significantly different with respect to subject characteristics, diet, or hormone concentrations. Significant inverse correlations were found between E(2) and body mass index (BMI) (P=0.02), SHBG and BMI (P=0.01), DHEA-S and dietary fiber (P=0.04), and A and protein:carbohydrate ratio (P=0.02). Probiotic consumption failed to significantly alter equol excretor status or hormone concentrations during menstrual cycle 3, although there were trends towards decreased concentrations of T (P=0.14) and SHBG (P=0.10) in the probiotic group. CONCLUSIONS: We were unable to verify a previously reported finding of premenopausal equol excretors having plasma hormone concentrations different from those of nonexcretors. Furthermore, a 2-month intervention with probiotic capsules did not significantly alter equol excretion or plasma hormone concentrations.
TI  - Presence of drug resistance in intestinal lactobacilli of dairy and human origin  in Turkey.
AB  - The prevalence of different resistance genes was investigated in lactobacilli of  human and dairy origin by PCR. The presence of erm, van, tet, and cat-TC genes were determined in 16 raw milk, 15 cream, 10 yogurt, 50 hand-made cheese, and 20 industrially produced white-cheese samples of dairy origin and 16 mouth, 32 fecal, and 36 vaginal samples from different subjects of human origin. Lactobacilli of dairy and human origin were found to carry only erm(B) and tet(M) genes. The majority of the isolates, Lactobacillus crispatus (61), Lactobacillus gasseri (49), Lactobacillus plantarum (80) studied were found to harbor either erm(B) or tet(M) gene or both. No resistant lactobacilli was found in raw-milk and cream samples. All the human fecal samples and the majority of vaginal (29 of 36) and mouth (10 of 14) samples were found to carry the resistance genes. While a third of the hand-made cheeses carried resistant lactobacilli only one industrially produced cheese was found to carry resistant lactobacilli. Furthermore, the genes were found in the non-starter species, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lb. plantarum, indicating that industrially produced cheeses in this respect could be considered more favorable. These results indicate that drug resistance seems to be very common in Turkey. Even though the number of dairy samples harboring the resistance genes (17 of 111) is smaller in regards to human samples, 10% of them were still found to carry the resistance genes as well. The presence of the resistance genes in majority of the samples of human origin and in minority of the samples of dairy origin indicates that drug resistance may be acquired in the intestinal tract during passage and spread to dairy products by the hands of workers during production.
TI  - [Microflora of milk with prolonged storage term at different production process].
AB  - New technologies have been studied for their effect on microbiologic indices of milk with prolonged storage term. It has been shown that the use of double pasterization decreases the number of Bacillus subtilis representatives to units of CFU/ml. The method of hot milk pouring into sealed package has 99.8% efficiency. Residual microflora was of dozens of CFU/ml and remained stable during 10 days. Lactobacillus acidophilus being introduced in pasterized milk, the amount of residual microflora decreased 2.3 times and storage term for milk increased to 14 days.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus protects tight junctions from aspirin damage in HT-29 cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs cause enterocyte damage inducing an increase of intestinal permeability. Tight junctions are the key structures in the permeability of the intestinal mucosa. ZO-1 is a tight junction associated protein considered a good marker of their integrity. It has been suggested that probiotics could play a protective role in the intestinal barrier function. We determined, in vitro, whether the heat-killed Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LB (LaLB) with its spent culture supernatant protects tight junctions of HT-29 cells from aspirin (ASA) damage. METHODS: HT-29 cells were treated with ASA alone or ASA and LaLB with its spent culture supernatant together. Morphological alterations of tight junctions were evaluated by immunofluorescence using an anti-ZO-1 antibody. Moreover, a semiquantitative assay for ZO-1 was performed by Western blot. RESULTS: Immunofluorescence analysis showed a fragmented and granulous ZO-1 staining, after ASA treatment. Using both ASA and LaLB with its spent culture supernatant together, we found a fine continuous linear web at cell-cell contacts similarly to control. Western blot revealed that ASA inhibited ZO-1 expression and LaLB with its spent culture supernatant counteracted this effect. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study shows, for the first time, the protective effect of LaLB with its spent culture supernatant on tight junctions from ASA damage. These results suggest that probiotics could play a role in the prevention of ASA-induced alterations of intestinal permeability.
TI  - [Search of promising strains of bifidobacteria and lactobacillus for the development of new biopreparations].
AB  - For the first time the species composition of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in  clinically healthy young children has been studied. As revealed in this study, the dominating species of bifidobacteria are B. longum, B. adolescentis and B. infantis, while the dominating species of lactobacilli are Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. rhamnosus. In 83 isolated cultures of bifidobacteria and 34 isolated species of lactobacilli the activity of acid formation and the antagonistic activity with respect to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens have been tested. B. longum strain 58B, B. infantis strain 37B, L. rhamnosus strain 12L and L. acidophilus strain 27L, typical for children of this age group, having good antagonistic activity and pronounced acid-forming properties, have been selected. These strains hold good promise to be used as the basis for the development of a complex probiotic preparation for correcting intestinal microflora in young children.
TI  - Characterization of bacterial diversity in pulque, a traditional Mexican alcoholic fermented beverage, as determined by 16S rDNA analysis.
AB  - The bacterial diversity in pulque, a traditional Mexican alcoholic fermented beverage, was studied in 16S rDNA clone libraries from three pulque samples. Sequenced clones identified as Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus strain ASF360, L. kefir, L. acetotolerans, L. hilgardii, L. plantarum, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Microbacterium arborescens, Flavobacterium johnsoniae, Acetobacter pomorium, Gluconobacter oxydans, and Hafnia alvei, were detected for the first time in pulque. Identity of 16S rDNA sequenced clones showed that bacterial diversity present among pulque samples is dominated by Lactobacillus species (80.97%). Seventy-eight clones exhibited less than 95% of relatedness to NCBI database sequences, which may indicate the presence of new species in pulque samples.
TI  - Dietary intervention with the probiotics Lactobacillus acidophilus 145 and Bifidobacterium longum 913 modulates the potential of human faecal water to induce damage in HT29clone19A cells.
AB  - Probiotics reduce the risk of colon cancer by inhibiting carcinogen-induced DNA damage in animals, but there are no analogous data in human subjects. To enhance knowledge of the effects of probiotics in human subjects, we have investigated the genotoxicity of faecal water after dietary intervention with standard yoghurt or with probiotic yoghurt, which included the strains Lactobacillus acidophilus 145 and Bifidobacterium longum 913. Faeces were collected from nine healthy volunteers after intervention with probiotic yoghurt or standard yoghurt. Faecal water was isolated and incubated with human colon tumour cells HT29clone19A. DNA strand breaks, oxidised DNA bases and damage after challenge with H2O2 were determined by micro-gel-electrophoresis. Faecal water was genotoxic in comparison with NaCl, but protected against H2O2-induced DNA strand breaks. The intervention with probiotic yoghurt significantly lowered faecal water genotoxicity compared with standard yoghurt. However, probiotic intervention also increased oxidative damage; this either reflected prooxidative activity or stimulation of endogenous defence systems. Altogether, the balance of effects favoured protection, since faecal water from the probiotic group reduced overall genetic damage. Thus, there was a reduction of strand break-inducing compounds in human faeces after dietary intervention with probiotic bacteria. This protection reflected results from previous studies in carcinogen-exposed animals where probiotics reduced DNA damage in colon cells.
TI  - Probiotics reduce the CD34+ hemopoietic precursor cell increased traffic in allergic subjects.
AB  - An increased traffic of circulating CD34+ Hemopoietic Precursors Cells (HPC) is an important feature of systemic allergic inflammation. Bacteria and bacterial products are capable of stimulating the transcription of the maturational cytokines IL12 and IFNs through the activation of Toll-Like-Receptor and the subsequent nuclear translocation of the NF-kappaB factor. In this study the probiotics differentiation/maturational effect potential on CD34+ HPC has been investigated. Fourteen consecutive subjects, 9M and 5F, aged 6-48, with clinical symptoms of asthma and /or conjunctivitis, rhinitis, urticaria, atopic dermatitis, food allergy and irritable bowel syndrome were enrolled. Allergen-specific serum IgE were found in twelve patients. Flow-cytometric measurement of peripheral blood CD34dim/bright HPC values were assessed before and after 30 days of therapy, consisting in the oral administration of one sachet a day of ENDOLAC (UCB Pharma, Turin, Italy). Each sachet contained a mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. delbrueckii and Streptococcus thermophilus for a total of 1 x 10(9) live bacteria. Circulating CD34+ cell values significantly (p < 0.001) reduced after the treatment. ENDOLAC, thus, may improve the efficacy of the standard treatments of allergic diseases.
TI  - [Growth and morphological characteristics of industrial strains of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus cultivated in hydrolysate-milk and hydrolysate-soybean media].
AB  - Growth features of industrial strains of Bifidobacterium adolescentis MC-42, B. bifidum 1, B. longum B-379, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 8-79 and L. plantarum 8PA3 cultivated in hydrolysate-milk or hydrolysate-soybean media (HMM and HSM respectively) were analysed comparatively. The bacterial cells were investigated morphometrically with atom strength microscopy. It was shown that HSM vs HMM provided a higher growth rate of the strains (shortened growth phases and higher growth rates) that was more evident for the bifidobacteria as compared to the lactobacilli. At the same time, the morphological features of the bacterial cells slightly depended on the medium composition and were mainly defined by the genus.
TI  - A new assay using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to determine binding of the Lactobacillus acidophilus group to human colonic mucin.
AB  - A new binding assay to investigate the mechanism of adhesion of lactic acid bacteria to the human intestine was established by the surface plasmon resonance technique using a biosensor BIACORE1000. Cells of 26 strains of the Lactobacillus acidophilus group as analytes were eluted onto a sensor chip on which were immobilized biotinylated A-trisaccharide polymer probes having human A-type antigen [(GalNAcalpha1-3(Fucalpha1-2)Gal)-] or human colonic mucin of blood type A (HCM-A) as ligands. In the first screening, high adhesive affinity to the A-trisaccharide BP-probe was observed in L. acidophilus OLL2769, L. crispatus JCM8778, LA205 and LA206. In the second screening, which used HCM-A, only L. acidophilus OLL2769 and L. crispatus JCM8778 were selected as adhesive strains with specific binding ability to human A-antigen. The results indicated that some strains of the L. acidophilus group could recognize and bind the sugar chain of A-antigen structure on HCM.
TI  - Detection of Leuconostoc strains at a meat processing plant using polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - To simplify the labor-intensive conventional routine testing of samples to detect Leuconostoc at a meat processing plant, we developed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers specific for Leuconostoc from 16S rRNA gene sequences. These primers did not detect other common lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus plantarum, Lact. sake, Lact. fermentum, Lact. acidophilus and Weissella viridescens. PCR with this primer detected all Leuconostoc species tested (Leu. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, Leu. pseudomesenteroides, Leu. carnosum, Leu. lactic, Leu. citreum, Leu. amelibiosum, Leu. gelidum), except for Leu. fallax, and no other lactic acid bacteria on agarose gel electrophoresis. The method could identify areas contaminated with Leuconostoc in a large-scale industrial meat processing plant. Of 69 samples analyzed, 34 were positive for Leuconostoc according to the conventional culture method (isolation of LAB producing dextran) and PCR, whereas 29 were negative according to both. Six samples were culture-negative but positive by PCR. No false negative results were generated by PCR. The method is rapid and simple, is useful for routinely monitoring areas contaminated with Leuconostoc in meat processing plants, and could help to prevent the spoilage of meat products.
TI  - John M. Kinney International Award for Pediatric Nutrition. Use of fermented foods to combat stunting and failure to thrive: background of the study.
AB  
TI  - Dietary supplementation with Lactobacillus- and Propionibacterium-based direct-fed microbials and prevalence of Escherichia coli O157 in beef feedlot cattle and on hides at harvest.
AB  - The objective of this study was to describe the prevalence of Escherichia coli O157 in the feces and on the hides of finishing beef cattle fed a standard diet and those fed diets supplemented with direct-fed microbials. Two hundred forty steers received one of four treatments throughout the feeding period: (i) control: no added microbials; (ii) HNP51: high dose of Lactohacillius acidophilus strain NP 51 (10(9) CFU per steer daily) and Propionibacterium freudenreichii (10(9) CFU per steer daily); (iii) HNP51+45: high dose of NP 51 (10(9) CFU per steer daily), P. freudenreichii (10(9) CFU per steer daily), and L. acidophilus NP 45 (10(6) CFU per steer daily); or (iv) LNP51+45: low dose of NP 51 (10(6) CFU per steer daily), P. freudenreichii (10(9) CFU per steer daily), and NP 45 (10(6) CFU per steer daily). Samples were collected from each animal and analyzed for the presence of E. coli O157 using immunomagnetic separation methods on day 0 (feces), 7 days before harvest (feces), and at harvest (feces and hide). At the end of the feeding period, cattle receiving HNP51 were 57% less likely to shed detectable E. coli O157 in their feces than were the controls (P < 0.01). For animals receiving HNP51+45 and LNP51+45, fecal prevalence did not differ from that of the controls. The prevalence of positive hide samples was least among cattle receiving HNP51+45 (3.3%); these animals were 79% less likely (P < 0.06) to have a positive hide sample than were the controls (prevalence = 13.8%). There was poor agreement of the culture results between fecal and hide samples collected from the same animal (kappa = 0.08; confidence interval = -0.05 to 0.2). Cattle supplemented with a high dose of NP 51 had reduced E. coli O157 prevalence in both fecal and hide samples, indicating that this treatment may be an efficacious preharvest intervention strategy.
TI  - Effects of Lactobacilli and an acidophilic fungus on the production performance and immune responses in broiler chickens.
AB  - Accumulated lines of evidence indicate that inactivated probiotics could have beneficial effects similar to those of live probiotics. Two strains of disrupted, cobalt-enriched, lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei) and a disrupted fungal mycelium (Scytalidium acidophilum) were spray-mixed onto a mash basal feed, in 2 concentrations, prior to pelleting. The effects of these probiotics on production performance and immune response in broiler chickens were investigated. The production parameters, including BW, feed intake (FI), BW gain (BWG), and feed conversion ratio (FCR), were monitored weekly during a 6-wk trial. The immune response was evaluated by immunizing the birds with the antigen keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) followed by a serological assay to measure blood IgA and IgG titers. Some of the production parameters were significantly improved by low L. casei (LCL; for BW and BWG), high L. acidophilus (LAH; for BW and BWG), and high fungal (FH; for BW, BWG, and FI) in comparison with the nonadditive control (NC-). However, these 3 treatments (LCL, LAH, and FH) did not enhance the measured immune responses. Instead, the titers of serum KLH-specific IgA in high L. casei (LCH) and low L. acidophilus (LAL) were significantly higher than those of NC-, 10 d after immunization. None of the probiotic treatments increased the titer of KLH-specific IgG in blood. Our results indicate that disrupted and cobalt-enriched L. acidophilus or L. casei was able to enhance production performance of broiler chickens. The fungal mycelium, S. acidophilum, when used at a high concentration, also demonstrated its potential for the first time to be used as a probiotic. In addition, the optimal concentration for administering probiotics is strain dependent. A higher dose does not always result in a better performance.
TI  - Effects of feeding a probiotic preparation (SIM) containing inulin on the severity of colitis and on the composition of the intestinal microflora in HLA-B27 transgenic rats.
AB  - An overly aggressive immune response to the intestinal microflora in a genetically susceptible host background has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases. We measured the impact of a probiotic preparation (SIM) containing inulin on the severity of colitis and on intestinal microflora profiles of HLA-B27-beta(2)-microglobulin transgenic (TG) rats. SIM is a mixture of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and inulin. Two-month-old TG rats received either SIM or water. Control TG rats received metronidazole, alone or in combination with SIM, for 8 weeks. Nontransgenic rats received SIM or water. The cecal content was removed for analysis of the intestinal microflora by PCR combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. The colon was scored for histological evidence of inflammation, colonic myeloperoxidase activity and interleukin-1beta RNA levels were measured photometrically or by real-time quantitative PCR. At 4 months, the colonic inflammation of TG rats treated with SIM was histologically diminished compared to that in untreated TG rats (2.2 +/- 0.2 versus 2.9 +/- 0.1; P </= 0.03). The administration of SIM altered the microflora profiles of TG rats by increasing the diversity and stimulating specifically the growth of Bifidobacterium animalis. The probiotic bacteria added to SIM were below the detection level in cecal stool samples at the end of the study period. The administration of SIM resulted in a measurable impact on the cecal microflora profiles of TG rats with attenuation of colitis. The lack of detection of any added probiotic bacteria in the cecal content suggests that prebiotic inulin is the major effective compound.
TI  - Viability of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria in fermented soymilk after drying, subsequent rehydration and storage.
AB  - To develop a probiotic dietary adjunct, soymilk fermented with various combinations of lactic acid bacteria (Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus acidophilus) and bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium longum and Bifidobacterium infantis) was subjected to freeze-drying and spray-drying. Survival of the starter organisms during the drying process, subsequent rehydration at different temperatures and during a 4-month period of storage under different storage conditions was examined. After freeze-drying, lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria exhibited a survival percent of 46.2-75.1% and 43.2-51.9%, respectively, higher than that noted after spray-drying. Regardless of the drying condition, S. thermophilus showed a higher percentage of survival than L. acidophilus, while B. longum survived better than B. infantis. Further study with soymilk fermented with S. thermophilus and B. longum revealed that the freeze-dried and spray-dried fermented soymilk rehydrated at 35-50 degrees C and 20 degrees C, respectively, was optimum for the recovery of the starter organisms. Both S. thermophilus and B. longum survived better in the freeze-dried than the spray-dried fermented soymilk during storage. A higher percent of survival was also noted for both the starter organisms when the dried fermented soymilk was stored at 4 degrees C than 25 degrees C. Holding the dried fermented soymilk in the laminated pouch enabled S. thermophilus and B. longum to exhibit a higher percentage of survival than in the deoxidant- and desiccant-containing glass or polyester (PET) bottle. Among all the packaging materials and storage temperatures tested, starter organisms were most stable in the dried fermented soymilk held in laminated pouch and stored at 4 degrees C. Under this storage condition, S. thermophilus and B. longum showed a survival percentage of 51.1% and 68.8%, respectively, in the freeze-dried fermented soymilk after 4 months of storage. Meanwhile, S. thermophilus and B. infantis in the spray-dried fermented soymilk showed a survival percent of 29.5% and 57.7%, respectively.
TI  - Effect of dentin on the antibacterial activity of dentin bonding agents.
AB  - Dentin bonding agents with antibacterial effects may inhibit secondary caries formation and pulp inflammation by eliminating residual bacteria in and on dentin. Therefore, the antibacterial effects of Prime & Bond NT (PB), Prime & Bond NT without fluoride (PBNF), Gluma Comfort Bond (GL), ABF, Xeno CF II (XE), 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEG-DMA), and 0.2% chlorhexidine were tested against Streptococcus mutans, S. sobrinus, and Lactobacillus acidophilus using the agar-diffusion method with and without bovine-dentin disks (200 microm and 500 microm thickness) placed between the bacteria and the test substances. Without dentin, ABF Primer showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. XE inhibited S. mutans and S. sobrinus, and PB S. sobrinus. ABF Bonding inhibited L. acidophilus. PBNF, HEMA, and TEGDMA did not have any antibacterial effects. Dentin disks of 500 microm thickness reduced the inhibitory effect of chlorhexidine to 23% to 54% compared with direct application. ABF Primer (nonpolymerized) produced inhibition zones against all tester strains regardless of dentin disks interposed or not. XE (against S. mutans and S. sobrinus) and PB (against S. sobrinus) did not produce any inhibition zones on 200 microm thick dentin. After polymerization, the ABF system did not inhibit bacterial growth on 200 microm thick dentin disks. A dentin barrier reduces significantly the antibacterial activity of chlorhexidine and dentin bonding agents.
TI  - Characterization and purification of acidocin CH5, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus CH5.
AB  - AIMS: To characterize and to purify a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus strain with its activity restricted to Gram-positive bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Native acidocin CH5, a bacteriocin produced by L. acidophilus CH5 an isolate from a dairy starter culture forms in MRS (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) broth high-molecular weight aggregates which can dissociate into smaller units (retained by 5 kDa membrane) with higher activity. Acidocin CH5 was purified using combinations of chromatographic methods based on hydrophobic and cation exchange principles and the N-terminal region was sequenced. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results it is evident that acidocin CH5 belongs, according to bacteriocin classification, to the class II bacteriocins with identical N-terminal amino acid sequence described in the literature previously. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The study has provided further data on bacteriocin acidocin CH5 from class II with wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity atypical for bacteriocins produced by L. acidophilus sharing the same homology.
TI  - [Biotechnology of yogurt and kefir production, study of their effect on human health].
AB  - Biotechnological parameters of bioyogurt and biokefir production have been studied. The impact of the temperature on biological activity of lactic acid bacteria strains have been studied in the consortia of direct vat set (DVS). The phase of milk fermentation and increase of acid production comes within 6 hours at the temperature of 40 degrees C and pH in the limits of 4.7-5.1 for thermophilic strains and 30 degrees C and pH 5.4-5.7 for mezophilic strains. The concentration of alive cells counts 5 x 10(10) CFU per 1 ml of the product. The probiotic properties of bioyogurt and biokefir have been proved by clinical trials. Positive effect on the health of elder people has been shown. Bioproducts have been related by clinicists to the group of functional products.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a feruloyl esterase from the intestinal bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Dietary ferulic acid (FA), a significant antioxidant substance, is currently the  subject of extensive research. FA in cereals exists mainly as feruloylated sugar ester. To release FA from food matrices, it is necessary to cleave ester cross-linking by feruloyl esterase (FAE) (hydroxycinnamoyl esterase; EC 3.1.1.73). In the present study, the FAE from a human typical intestinal bacterium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, was isolated, purified, and characterized for the first time. The enzyme was purified in successive steps including hydrophobic interaction chromatography and anion-exchange chromatography. The purified FAE appeared as a single band in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, with an apparent molecular mass of 36 kDa. It has optimum pH and temperature characteristics (5.6 and 37 degrees C, respectively). The metal ions Cu(2+) and Fe(3+) (at a concentration of 5 mmol liter(-1)) inhibited FAE activity by 97.25 and 94.80%, respectively. Under optimum pH and temperature with 5-O-feruloyl-L-arabinofuranose (FAA) as a substrate, the enzyme exhibited a K(m) of 0.0953 mmol liter(-1) and a V(max) of 86.27 mmol liter(-1) min(-1) mg(-1) of protein. Furthermore, the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified FAE was found to be A R V E K P R K V I L V G D G A V G S T. The FAE released FA from O-(5-O-feruloyl-alpha-L-arabinofuranosyl)-(1-->3)-O-beta-D-xylopyranosyl-(1-->4)- D-xylopyranose (FAXX) and FAA obtained from refined corn bran. Moreover, it released two times more FA from FAXX in the presence of added xylanase.
TI  - Production of phenyllactic acid by lactic acid bacteria: an approach to the selection of strains contributing to food quality and preservation.
AB  - The ability of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to produce phenyllactic (PLA) and 4-hydroxy-phenyllactic (OH-PLA) acids, metabolites involved in food quality and preservation, has been evaluated by HPLC analysis in 29 LAB strains belonging to 12 species widely used in the production of fermented foods. Metabolite production was demonstrated for all strains of the species Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus alimentarius, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, Lactobacillus hilgardii, Leuconostoc citreum, and for some strains of Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides. Strains were distinguished by analysis of variance in three groups including 15 strains that produced both metabolites (0.16-0.46 mM PLA and 0.07-0.29 mM OH-PLA), five strains accumulating in culture only PLA (0.17-0.57 mM) and nine non-producer strains (< or = 0.10 mM PLA and < or = 0.02 mM OH-PLA). Improvement of phenyllactic acid production was obtained in a selected L. plantarum strain by increasing the concentration of phenylalanine in culture and using low amounts of tyrosine.
TI  - [Dynamic observation of periodontal pathogens and cariogenic bacteria in modified chemostat using confocal laser scanning microscopy].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study dynamic relation between periodontal pathogens and cariogenic bacteria under analogous oral environment. METHODS: Eight periodontopathic and cariogenic bacteria of Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), Provotella intermedium (Pi), Streptococcus mutans (Sm), Streptococcus sanguis (Ss), Actinomyces viscosus (Av) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (La) were used. These eight strains were cultured in modified chemostat under analogous oral environment which contained 600 ml modified BM medium supplemented with 2.5 g/L porcine gastric mucin, respectively. After 1, 24, 48 and 96 h, optical sectioning of plaque biofilms on removable and replaceable hydroxyapatite disks was analyzed by the combination of live bacterial Gram fluorescence staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Biofilm thickness and reconstruction of the three-dimensional architecture of plaque biofilms were made. RESULTS: Biofilm thickness increased significantly with time (P < 0.001). Biofilms of Aa were thinner than those of Ss and eight-specie biofilms were thicker than those formed by Ss and Aa per time point. Three-dimensional images showed periodontal pathogens mainly occurred in cariogenic bacterial complex or on the biofilm surface. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-positive cariogenic species initially predominated in artificial plaque, followed by the increasing proportions of Gram-negative periodontal pathogens. The relation between microecological balance among bacteria and diseases is worthy of further studies.
TI  - The role of oxygen in the viability of probiotic bacteria with reference to L. acidophilus and Bifidobacterium spp.
AB  - The various therapeutic benefits of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium spp. have resulted in their increased incorporation into dairy foods such as yoghurts. Currently however, the efficacy of these probiotic bacteria is limited by their poor survival during the shelf life of yoghurt. Oxygen toxicity is widely considered to be responsible for the cell deaths of these bacteria. The intestinal origins and the microaerophilic and anaerobic characteristics of L. acidophilus and Bifidobacterium spp. respectively, can render them susceptible to oxygen contained in the food products. This review discusses the influence of the dissolved oxygen in yogurt on the viability of these bacteria. Suggested techniques to protect these probiotic bacteria from oxygen toxicity are evaluated. Although the problem of oxygen toxicity in probiotic bacteria is regarded as significant, little is known however about the cellular interaction of these bacteria with oxygen. This review summarizes what is known about the biochemistry of oxygen toxicity in these bacteria. The various metabolic and biochemical responses of L. acidophilus and Bifidobacterium to oxygen are examined. Additionally, the importance of NADH oxidase and NADH peroxidase in the oxygen tolerance of these bacteria is evaluated and assays used to measure their cellular concentrations are discussed.
TI  - Antagonistic activity of lactic acid bacteria as probiotics against selected bacteria of the Enterobaceriacae family in the presence of polyols and their galactosyl derivatives.
AB  - Probiotic lactic acid bacteria were grown on erythritol, xylitol, sorbitol or lactitol and produced various derivatives: gal-erythritol, gal-xylitol, and gal-sorbitol as prebiotics. Galactosyl derivatives of erythritol, xylitol and sorbitol were metabolised by Lactobacillus spp. This resulted in their antagonistic activity against the test microflora. No activity was observed in the presence of xylitol and erythritol. Gal-sorbitol obtained by enzymatic transglycosylation from lactose had the same abilities of inducing the antagonistic activity of lactic acid bacteria that lactitol had.
TI  - Genotypic analyses of lactobacilli with a range of tannase activities isolated from human feces and fermented foods.
AB  - A total of 77 tannase producing lactobacilli strains isolated from human feces or fermented foods were examined for their genotypic profiles and intensities of tannase production. With a PCR-based assay targeting recA gene, all strains except one isolate were assigned to either Lactobacillus plantarum, L. paraplantarum, or L. pentosus whereas a 16/23S rDNA targeted PCR-based assay identified all except 6 isolates (inclusive of the above one isolate) as one of the closely related species. Subsequent DNA/DNA hybridization assays revealed that these 6 exceptional isolates showed low homology (between 1.2% and 55.8% relative DNA binding) against type strains of the three species. Supplemental carbohydrate fermentation profiles on the 6 isolates indicated that two of them were identified as L. acidophilus, one as Pediococcus acidilactici, one as P. pentosaceus, and two remained unidentifiable. The evidence suggests that the 16/23S rDNA targeted PCR assay can be used as a reliable identification tool for the closely related lactobacilli, and that the tannase gene is widely distributed within members of the Lactobacillaceae family. Meanwhile, a randomly amplified polymorphism DNA (RAPD) analysis revealed that all except 8 isolates were well allocated in 4 major RAPD clusters, though not species specific, consisting of two L. plantarum predominant clusters, one L. paraplantarum predominant, and one L. pentosus predominant. The RAPD patterns of the 8 non-clustered isolates, which consisted of the 6 unidentifiable isolates and 2 isolates identified as L. pentosus, were <40% similarity to those belonging to the 4 clusters. A quantitative assay of the tannase activities showed that there was a marked variation in the activities among the strains, which did not correlate with either species identification or clustering by RAPD.
TI  - The effect of the addition of proteases and glucanases during yeast autolysis on  the production and properties of yeast extracts.
AB  - Yeast extracts (YE) were produced with the addition of proteases or glucanases during bakers' yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) autolysis. Chemical composition, physical properties, and biological value of the YE were examined. Proteases had the highest impact on the turbidity and filterability of YE. All 11 proteases and two glucanases increased YE yields (% yeast solids solubilized) obtained from heated (80 degrees C/15 min) bakers' yeast creams (BYC). However, when proteases were added to native (unheated) BYC during autolysis, few increased YE yields, with papain being the most effective. The increased yields were generally related to increased levels of total nitrogen (TN) and alpha-amino nitrogen (alpha-AN) in the YE. Media were supplemented with the various yeast extracts, and the highest growth rates (mumax) and biomass values (ODmax) of Lactobacillus acidophilus were noted. The best growth was obtained with YE produced with native BYC treated with a fungal protease, and results of this study show that some enzymes could be used to produce improved YE for microbiological media.
TI  - Testing two Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus acidophilus strains for their suitability as a lipoid probiotic.
AB  - Two strains of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus acidophilus T-135 and Lactobacillus plantarum 4/97) were selected in order to study their inhibitory properties against frequent udder pathogens (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Salmonella enteritidis and Bacillus pumilus), their production of organic acids as well as their ability to survive on the teat skin, the teat duct mucosa and in a lipoid emulsion. Both strains inhibited the tested pathogenic microbes and survived on the investigated surfaces and in an emulsion for more than 6 hours and 11 days, respectively.
TI  - CbsT2 from Lactobacillus johnsonii 100-100 is a transport protein of the major facilitator superfamily that facilitates bile acid antiport.
AB  - We previously identified two conjugated bile acid transporters, CbsT1 and CbsT2,  in Lactobacillus johnsonii 100-100 and Lactobacillus acidophilus KS-13 that are gene duplicates encoded in tandem with a conjugated bile salt hydrolase (BSH) [Elkins and Savage, J. Bacteriol. 180:4344-4349, 1998; Elkins et al., Microbiology 147: 3403-3412, 2001]. CbsT2 from 100-100 was shown to increase taurocholic acid (TCA) uptake in Escherichia coli; however, higher levels were achieved when an extracellular factor (EF) from 100-100 was present in the assay medium (spent medium from 100-100, pH 4.2). We continued this study here to determine the role of EF in this transport system. Kinetic studies revealed that the previously observed CbsT2- and EF-mediated TCA accumulation is rapid (< 15 s) but not saturable, suggesting that EF is limiting. In addition, uptake of TCA by E. coli expressing CbsT2 was insensitive to ionophores, 2,4-dinitrophenol and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, and thus, is independent of the proton motive force. Since BSH converts [24-(14)C]TCA to [24-(14)C]cholic acid (CA), we measured net radiolabel uptake in E. coli cells expressing transporter(s) and BSH. Interestingly, such cells accumulated less 14C radiolabel (by approximately half) than cells expressing CbsT2 alone. These data can be explained if CA diffuses out of E. coli through the transporter(s). We, therefore, added exogenous, unlabeled CA to EF-spent media, which under our assay conditions, performed similarly to EF+ culture supernatant in TCA and CA uptake assays. Thus, unlabeled CA (a protonated, neutral lipophile) can partition directly into E. coli cells especially at low pH. These findings were validated in uptake assays with [3H]TCA, which yields [3H]taurine (a hydrophilic moiety) upon hydrolysis by the BSH. Amounts of cell-associated 3H radiolabel remained similar in cells expressing CbsT2 and BSH versus cells expressing only CbsT2, both of which were higher than in cells expressing BSH alone. Our data support a hypothesis that these transporters, which comprise a new subfamily of the major facilitator superfamily, facilitate antiport of TCA and CA.
TI  - Endotoxinemia and benzodiazepine-like substances in compensated cirrhotic patients: a randomized study comparing the effect of rifaximine alone and in association with a symbiotic preparation.
AB  - Aim: The aim of the present investigation was to test study benzodiazepines (BZDs) profile in patients with viral cirrhosis under different combinations of rifaximine and of a novel symbiotic. Methods: Our study groups consisted of 30 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of HCV-related Child B liver cirrhosis. Patients were randomly allocated into three groups: rifaximine 400mg t.i.d. for 2 weeks; (B) SCM-III (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus and Bifidobacteria in a ion- and vitamin-enriched medium, Named srl, Italy) 10ml t.i.d. for 2 weeks; (C) rifaximine 400mg t.i.d. for 1 week followed by SCM-III 10ml t.i.d. for 5 weeks. At weekly interval, blood samples were withdrawn to test BZD-like substances, ammonia and endotoxin. Results: Rifaximine treatment brought about a significant early drop of BZDs ( [Formula: see text] versus pre-treatment and versus control) till fourth week of observation when a gradual increase took place with return to pre-treatment values at the sixth week. Symbiotic treatment was comparably effective while given to patients but significantly elevated BZDs level were noted starting from the third week. Similar phenomena were noted for endotoxin and ammonia although symbiotic seemed more effective against endotoxin and rifaximine against ammonia increase. However, the sequential treatment rifaximine-symbiotic brought about a sustained normalization of BZDs, ammonia and endotoxin throughout the 6-week study. Conclusion: The present pilot study suggests that a rifaximine-symbiotic regimen could be an effective tool in compensated liver cirrhosis to limit some triggering factors of hepatic encephalopathy while being amenable to long-term use and devoid of significant side effects.
TI  - Immunomodulatory and antitumor effects in vivo by the cytoplasmic fraction of Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium longum.
AB  - The immunomodulatory and antitumor effects of lactic acid bacteria (LABs) were investigated. Cytoplasmic fraction of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium longum were tested for the antiproliferative activity in vitro to SNUC2A, SNU1, NIH/3T3 and Jurkat cell lines by crystal violet assay. All cytoplasmic fraction suppressed proliferation of tumor cells, though L. casei and B. longum were more effective. From these results, cytoplasmic fraction of L. casei and B. longum with Y400 as a control were administered as dietary supplements to Balb/c mice for 2, and 4 consecutive wks. Administration for 4 wks enhanced the number of total T cells, NK cells and MHC class II+ cells, and CD4-CD8+ T cells in flow cytometry analysis. To determine of antitumor activity of LABs preparation in vivo, F9 teratocarcinoma cells were inoculated on mice at 14th day. Body weight was decreased with increased survival rate in all groups with the cytoplasm of LABs. Our results showed that cytoplasmic fraction of LABs had direct antiproliferative effects on tumor cell lines in vitro, effects on immune cells in vivo, and antitumor effects on tumor-bearing mice with prolonged survival periods.
TI  - Effects of probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus strain DSM13241 in healthy adult dogs.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate viability of a probiotic strain of Lactobacillus acidophilus in a dry dog food, determine its ability to survive transit through the gastrointestinal tract and populate the colon, and assess its effects on intestinal and systemic parameters. ANIMALS: 15 adult dogs. PROCEDURE: Dogs were sequentially fed a dry control food for 2 weeks, the same food supplemented with > 10(9) L. acidophilus for 4 weeks, and the control food again for 2 weeks. Fecal score was assessed daily, and fecal and blood samples were collected for enumeration of bacterial populations and measurement of hematologic variables. RESULTS: Recovery of L. acidophilus from the supplemented food was 71% and 63% at the start and end of the study, respectively, indicating that the bacteria were able to survive manufacture and storage. The probiotic bacterium was detected in feces via ribotyping and RNA gene sequencing during the probiotic administration phase but not 2 weeks after cessation of administration. Administration of the probiotic-supplemented food was associated with increased numbers of fecal lactobacilli and decreased numbers of clostridial organisms. There were significant increases in RBCs, Hct, hemoglobin concentration, neutrophils, monocytes, and serum immunoglobin G concentration and reductions in RBC fragility and serum NO concentration. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These data indicate that L. acidophilus can be successfully incorporated into a dry dog food, survive transit through the canine gastrointestinal tract, and populate the colon and are associated with local and systemic changes. This probiotic bacterium may have the potential to enhance intestinal health and improve immune function in dogs.
TI  - In vitro comparative kinetics of adhesive and haemolytic potential of T. vaginalis isolates from symptomatic and asymptomatic females.
AB  - The host parasite relationship and pathogenic mechanisms of the commonly reported sexually transmitted urogenital disease, trichomoniasis, are poorly understood. This study was planned to correlate the adhesion properties of Trichomonas vaginalis isolates from symptomatic and asymptomatic women to vaginal epithelial cells in vitro (in presence and absence of L. acidophilus) and to ascertain the haemolytic activity of the isolates, in order to assess these properties as possible markers of pathogenicity. Cytoadherence assay study shows the significant difference in adhesion only up to first 15 minutes of incubation in symptomatic versus asymptomatic isolates. The presence of L. acidophilus was found to be more effective in enhancing the attachment of T. vaginalis in a time dependent manner mostly operative through its pH lowering effect, whereas the excretory secretory products of L. acidophilus reduced the attachment in case of both symptomatic and asymptomatic isolates. Amount of haemoglobin released by isolates from symptomatic patients was significantly higher than by the isolates from asymptomatic women. This investigation forms the basis for future studies to explore the role of other known virulence factors of T. vaginalis in initiation and persistence of vaginal infection by the parasite.
TI  - Reclassification of Lactobacillus kefirgranum Takizawa et al. 1994 as Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens subsp. kefirgranum subsp. nov. and emended description of L. kefiranofaciens Fujisawa et al. 1988.
AB  - Fourteen homofermentative lactic acid bacteria that were isolated from kefir grains and kefir fermented milks were assigned to either Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens or Lactobacillus kefirgranum, based on their characteristic morphotypes, phenotypic features and SDS-PAGE profiles of whole-cell proteins. Further genotypic analyses on representative strains from both taxa demonstrated that L. kefiranofaciens and L. kefirgranum share 100 % 16S rDNA sequence similarity and belong phylogenetically to the Lactobacillus acidophilus species group. DNA-DNA binding values of >79 % and analogous DNA G+C contents of 37-38 mol% showed that the strains studied belonged to one species: L. kefirgranum is a later synonym of L. kefiranofaciens. An emended description is proposed for L. kefiranofaciens. Due to the specific morphological and biochemical characteristics of these taxa in kefir grain formation, it is proposed that L. kefirgranum should be reclassified as L. kefiranofaciens subsp. kefirgranum subsp. nov.
TI  - Role of unbalanced growth of gram-negative bacteria in ileal ulcer formation in rats treated with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug.
AB  - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) induced formation of intestinal ulcers as side effects, in which an unbalanced increase in the number of gram-negative bacteria in the small intestine plays an important role. To clarify how intestinal microflora are influenced by NSAIDs, we examined the effects of 5-bromo-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl) thiophene (BFMeT), an NSAID, on intestinal motility and on the growth of Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Transit index, a marker of peristalsis, was not different in BFMeT-treated and solvent-treated rats, indicating that BFMeT increased the number of gram-negative bacteria without suppression of peristalsis. The factors that affect the growth of intestinal bacteria were not found in intestinal contents of BFMeT-treated rats, because the growth of E. coli and that of L. acidophilus in the supernatants of small intestinal contents of BFMeT-treated rats and solvent-treated rats were not different. The mechanism of the increase in the number of gram-negative bacteria is still unclear, but heat-killed E. coli cells and their purified lipopolysaccharide (LPS) caused deterioration of BFMeT-induced ileal ulcers, while they could not cause the ulcers by themselves without the NSAID. Concentration of LPS and myeloperoxidase activity level were elevated correlatively in the intestinal mucosa of rats treated with LPS and BFMeT. These results suggest that an increase in the number of gram-negative bacteria and their LPS in the mucosa induces activation of neutrophils together with the help of NSAID action and causes ulcer formation.
TI  - Fermentation of banana media by using kappa-carrageenan immobilized Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Fermentation media were prepared by using banana as the raw material, and cell immobilization of Lactobacillus acidophilus by kappa-carrageenan entrapment was applied to enhance the fermentation efficiency. Gel beads of diameters around 3.0 mm were prepared for the immobilized cells, ripe bananas were used for preparation of media, and both free and immobilized cells were employed to carry out the fermentation for 80 h. Cells leaked out from the gel beads and proliferated in the medium solution during the fermentation of immobilized cells. The final viable cell number reached 10(5) CFU/ml in the medium suspension, over 10(8) CFU/(ml gel) in gel beads for the immobilized cell fermentation and around 10(6) CFU/ml for the free cell fermentation. Immobilized cells withstand the adverse conditions in banana media resulting in better fermentation efficiency compared to free cells. Variation of fructooligosaccharides (FOS) in banana media was not significant in immobilized cell fermentation compared to free cell. Immobilized L. acidophilus fermented banana medium was found to possess synbiotic properties.
TI  - Growth and metabolism of selected strains of probiotic bacteria, in maize porridge with added malted barley.
AB  - A fermented probiotic maize porridge with high energy density and low viscosity was prepared, using maize flour and barley malt. The porridge was fermented with four probiotic strains (grown separately): Lactobacillus reuteri, Lb. acidophilus (LA5 and 1748) and Lb. rhamnosus GG. These strains were inoculated at two levels; to obtain approx. 7 or 6 log cfu g(-1) in the porridge at 0 h. The porridge was fermented for 24 h at 37 degrees C, and analysed for viable cell count, pH, organic acids, volatile aromatic compounds and sugar content. The inoculated cell concentration was shown to be particularly important during the first hours of the fermentation period, showing a delayed production of most metabolites in porridge inoculated with approx. 6 log cfu g(-1). Most strains reached maximum cell count after 12-h fermentation (7.2-8.2 log cfu g(-1)), with a pH below 4.0. Depending on the strain, lactic acid was produced in amounts ranging from 1360 to 4000 mg kg(-1). Lb. reuteri metabolised succinate, while pyruvate and small amounts of diacetyl were detected in porridge inoculated with Lb. acidophilus LA5 and Lb. acidophilus 1748. High amounts of diacetyl (6 mg kg(-1)) and acetoin (27 mg kg(-1)) were detected in porridge inoculated with Lb. rhamnosus GG. Porridge inoculated with Lb. acidophilus LA5 and Lb. acidophilus 1748, contained acetaldehyde, while both Lb. reuteri and Lb. rhamnosus GG reduced the acetaldehyde to ethanol. Lb. reuteri utilised both maltose and glucose as carbohydrate sources, while Lb. acidophilus LA5, Lb. acidophilus 1748 and Lb. rhamnosus GG utilised only glucose.
TI  - The genome sequence of the probiotic intestinal bacterium Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC 533.
AB  - Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC 533 is a member of the acidophilus group of intestinal lactobacilli that has been extensively studied for their "probiotic" activities that include, pathogen inhibition, epithelial cell attachment, and immunomodulation. To gain insight into its physiology and identify genes potentially involved in interactions with the host, we sequenced and analyzed the 1.99-Mb genome of L. johnsonii NCC 533. Strikingly, the organism completely lacked genes encoding biosynthetic pathways for amino acids, purine nucleotides, and most cofactors. In apparent compensation, a remarkable number of uncommon and often duplicated amino acid permeases, peptidases, and phosphotransferase-type transporters were discovered, suggesting a strong dependency of NCC 533 on the host or other intestinal microbes to provide simple monomeric nutrients. Genome analysis also predicted an abundance (>12) of large and unusual cell-surface proteins, including fimbrial subunits, which may be involved in adhesion to glycoproteins or other components of mucin, a characteristic expected to affect persistence in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Three bile salt hydrolases and two bile acid transporters, proteins apparently critical for GIT survival, were also detected. In silico genome comparisons with the >95% complete genome sequence of the closely related Lactobacillus gasseri revealed extensive synteny punctuated by clear-cut insertions or deletions of single genes or operons. Many of these regions of difference appear to encode metabolic or structural components that could affect the organisms competitiveness or interactions with the GIT ecosystem.

AB  
TI  - Multicenter, randomized, controlled trial of heat-killed Lactobacillus acidophilus LB in patients with chronic diarrhea.
AB  - Chronic diarrhea is a common bowel disorder; disturbance of intestinal microorganisms may play a role in its pathogenesis. This study assessed the clinical efficacy of lyophilized, heat-killed Lactobacillus acidophilus LB versus living lactobacilli in the treatment of chronic diarrhea. One hundred thirty-seven patients with chronic diarrhea were randomly allocated to receive either a 4-week course of 2 capsules of Lacteol Fort twice a day (Lacteol group, 69 patients) or a 4-week course of 5 chewable tablets of Lacidophilin three times a day (Lacidophilin group, 64 patients). The frequency of stools was recorded quantitatively, and semiquantitative parameters such as stool consistency, abdominal pain, distention, and feeling of incomplete evacuation were evaluated. At the second and fourth week of treatment, mean bowel frequency was significantly lower in the Lacteol group than in the Lacidophilin group (1.88 +/- 1.24 vs 2.64 +/- 1.12, 1.39 +/- 0.92 vs 2.19 +/- 1.05; P<.05). At the end of the treatment, the clinical symptoms were markedly improved in the Lacteol group, indicating that L. acidophilus LB is more effective than living lactobacilli in the treatment of chronic diarrhea.
TI  - Modulation of anti-pathogenic activity in canine-derived Lactobacillus species by carbohydrate growth substrate.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the effect of various carbon sources on the production of extracellular antagonistic compounds against two Escherichia coli strains and Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium by three canine-derived lactobacilli strains. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Cell-free preparations, pH neutralized, were used in antibiotic disc experiments as an initial screening. The bacteria/carbohydrate combinations that showed inhibition of the growth of those pathogens, were further investigated in batch co-culture experiments. The cell-free supernatants of the cultures, that decreased the population number of the pathogens in the co-culture experiments to log CFU ml-1 <or= 4, were tested for inhibition of the pathogens in pure cultures at neutral and acidic pH. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that the substrate seems to affect the production of antimicrobial compounds and this effect could not just be ascribed to the ability of the bacteria to grow in the various carbon sources. L. mucosae, L. acidophilus and L. reuteri, when grown in sugar mixtures consisting of alpha-glucosides (Degree of Polymerization (DP) 1-4) could produce antimicrobial compounds active against all three pathogens in vitro. This effect could not be attributed to a single ingredient of those sugar mixtures and was synergistic. This inhibition had a dose-response characteristic and was more active at acidic pH. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Knowledge of the effect that the carbon source has on the production of antimicrobial compounds by gut-associated lactobacilli allows the rational design of prebiotic/probiotic combinations to combat gastrointestinal pathogens.
TI  - Use of folic acid casei medium reveals trimethoprim susceptibility of Lactobacillus species.
AB  - AIM: Lactobacilli have been reported to have intrinsic resistance to trimethoprim. The susceptibility of lactobacilli to trimethoprim on different media was investigated in order to search for a phenotypic test method that could indicate the presence of acquired resistance genes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. paracasei, Lact. rhamnosus and Lact. plantarum were susceptibility tested with E-tests on folic acid casei medium (FACM), MRS and defined medium 1. The effects of addition or removal of nucleosides and thymidine phosphorylase were investigated. E-tests on FACM yielded reproducible minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for trimethoprim but addition of nucleosides was necessary for growth of Lact. acidophilus. MICs for the tested strains were 0.125-0.19, 0.25-3 and 0.064-0.19 microg ml(-1) for Lact. paracasei, Lact. rhamnosus and Lact. plantarum, respectively. With the addition of deoxyuridine and deoxyadenosine to FACM the MICs of Lact. acidophilus were 0.064-1 microg ml(-1). CONCLUSIONS, SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Lactobacilli do not have intrinsic resistance to trimethoprim. The results show that trimethoprim susceptibility testing of the tested Lactobacillus species is possible and indicate that transferable resistance genes are absent in all the tested strains.
TI  - Two distinct pathways for the formation of hydroxy FA from linoleic acid by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Twenty-three of 86 strains of lactic acid bacteria transformed linoleic acid into hydroxy FA. Two distinct conversion pathways were in operation. Two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus and a strain of Pediococcus pentosaceus produced 13(S)-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid 113(S)-OH 18:11 and 10,13dihydroxyoctadecanoic acid (10,13-OH 18:0) as main and minor products, respectively, whereas 13 strains, including L. casei subsp. casei, L. paracasei subsp. paracasei, L. rhamnosus, L. lactis subsp. cremoris, and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus produced 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid (10-OH 18:1). Seven strains of L. plantarum converted linoleic acid to 10-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid (10-OH 18:0) through 10-OH 18:1. Linoleic acid at 2 g/L was converted by L. acidophilus IFO13951T to 1.3 g of 13(S)-OH 18:1 and 0.09 g of 10,13-OH 18:0 in 7 d. Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei JCM 1111 produced 10-OH 18:1 in 91% yield, and L. plantarum JCM 8341, 10-OH 18:0 in 59% yield from linoleic acid (2 g/L) under optimal conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the production of 13(S)-OH 18:1 by lactic acid bacteria other than ruminal bacteria, and of 10,13-OH 18:0 by any bacteria.
TI  - Use of group-specific and RAPD-PCR analyses for rapid differentiation of Lactobacillus strains from probiotic yogurts.
AB  - The increasing interest in probiotic lactobacilli implicates the requirement of techniques that allow a rapid and reliable identification of these organisms. In this study, group-specific PCR and RAPD-PCR analyses were used to identify strains of the Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus groups most commonly used in probiotic yogurts. Group-specific PCR with primers for the L. casei and L. acidophilus groups, as well as L. gasseri/johnsonii, could differentiate between 20 Lactobacillus strains isolated from probiotic yogurts and assign these into the corresponding groups. For identification of these strains to species or strain level, RAPD profiles of the 20 Lactobacillus strains were compared with 11 reference strains of the L. acidophilus and L. casei group. All except one strain could be attributed unambigously to the species L. acidophilus, L. johnsonii, L. crispatus, L. casei, and L. paracasei. DNA reassociation analysis confirmed the classification resulting from the RAPD-PCR.

TI  - Survival of lactococci during passage through mouse digestive tract.
AB  - One of the important properties of probiotics is the ability to survive in the intestine. There have been few studies on the probiotic property of lactococci, since they are formally not considered to be natural inhabitants of the intestine. To evaluate lactococci as probiotic bacteria, we investigated their ability to survive during gastric transit by in vitro and in vivo tests. When exposed to an in vitro simulated gastrointestinal environment, such as low pH and bile, only Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis bv. diacetylactis N7 showed a moderate survival rate among the four strains tested. The tested strains were orally administered to mice, and intestinal passage of the ingested strains was monitored by two methods: antibiotics and PCR. Viable cells of strain N7 were recovered from feces within 24-48 h after administration but not at 72 h. Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris ATCC 19257, which had a poor survival rate in vitro test, was also detected at 12 h but not at 24 h. These results indicate that lactococci can reach the mouse intestine alive, but not colonize it. If administered daily, viable strain N7 may exist continuously in the intestine. The effect of strain N7 on intestinal microbial balance and on animal health will be the subject of a further study.
TI  - Randomised clinical trial of synbiotic therapy in elective surgical patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is possible to manipulate the composition of the gastrointestinal  microflora by administration of pre- and probiotics. This may help to preserve gut barrier function and reduce the incidence of septic morbidity. AIMS: To assess the effects of a combination of pre- and probiotics (synbiotic) on bacterial translocation, gastric colonisation, systemic inflammation, and septic morbidity in elective surgical patients. PATIENTS: Patients were enrolled two weeks prior to elective abdominal surgery. Seventy two patients were randomised to the synbiotic group and 65 to the placebo group. Patients were well matched regarding age and sex distribution, diagnoses, and POSSUM scores. METHODS: Patients in the synbiotic group received a two week preoperative course of Lactobacillus acidophilus La5, Bifidobacterium lactis Bb-12, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactobacillus bulgaricus, together with the prebiotic oligofructose. Patients in the placebo group received placebo capsules and sucrose powder. At surgery, a nasogastric aspirate, mesenteric lymph node, and scrapings of the terminal ileum were harvested for microbiological analysis. Serum was collected preoperatively and on postoperative days 1 and 7 for measurement of C reactive protein, interleukin 6, and antiendotoxin antibodies. Septic morbidity and mortality were recorded. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the synbiotic and control groups in bacterial translocation (12.1% v 10.7%; p = 0.808, chi(2)), gastric colonisation (41% v 44%; p = 0.719), systemic inflammation, or septic complications (32% v 31%; p = 0.882). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, synbiotics had no measurable effect on gut barrier function in elective surgical patients. Further studies investigating the place of pre- and probiotics in clinical practice are required.
TI  - Relationship between interaction sites in the gut, hydrophobicity, mucosal immunomodulating capacities and cell wall protein profiles in indigenous and exogenous bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate whether there is a relationship between interaction sites in the gut, hydrophobicity, mucosal immunomodulating capacities and cell wall protein profiles in lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and enterococci. METHODS AND RESULTS: Hydrophobicity, cell wall protein profiles and sites of interaction in the gut (by using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled bacteria) were determined for Lactobacillus casei, L. acidophilus, L. fermentum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, B. animalis and Enterococcus faecalis. We also determined the number of immunoglobulin (Ig)A+, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)alpha+, interleukin (IL)-6+ and IL-10+ cells after oral administration of the above bacteria to BALB/c mice. All strains assessed were found to interact with the sites of induction of the immune response in the gut. No correlation with hydrophobicity was observed. When some strains at certain doses were administered to mice, bacterial translocation to liver was observed. The oral administration of indigenous (104 cells day(-1)) and exogenous (107 cells day(-1)) bifidobacteria and lactobacilli for 5 consecutive days activated the systemic and intestinal mucosal immune response in a strain-specific way, independently whether the strain was indigenous or exogenous in relation to the host. The differences in the immunopotentiating capacity of the various strains might be related to the differences in their cell wall protein profiles. CONCLUSIONS: Indigenous bacteria activated the mucosal immune response at a dose significantly smaller than the one required for probiotic exogenous bacteria. However, probiotic exogenous bacteria can be used at high concentrations in fermented dairy products with a great impact on the immune system, favouring its immunomodulation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The immunomodulation capacity of probiotic bacteria is strain specific and independent of the specificity of the host. The ability of certain strains to down-regulate the production and release of IL-6 by IL-10 may have potential implications in their use in cases in which cytokine deregulation or excessive production at the mucosal level can be the cause of tissue damage.
TI  - An improved method of microencapsulation and its evaluation to protect Lactobacillus spp. in simulated gastric conditions.
AB  - An improved method of microencapsulation was developed to increase the efficacy of capsules in protecting the encapsulated bacteria under simulated gastric conditions. Lactobacillus acidophilus CSCC 2400 was encapsulated in calcium alginate and tested for its survival in simulated gastric conditions. The effects of different capsule sizes (200, 450, 1000 microm), different sodium alginate concentrations (0.75%, 1%, 1.5%, 1.8% and 2% w/v) and different concentrations of calcium chloride (0.1, 0.2, 1.0 M) on the viability of encapsulated bacteria were investigated. The viability of the cells in the microcapsules increased with an increase in alginate capsule size and gel concentration. There was no significant difference (p>0.05) in the viability of encapsulated cells when the concentration of calcium chloride was increased. Increase in cell load during encapsulation increased the number of bacterial survivors at the end of 3-h incubation in simulated gastric conditions. Hardening the capsule in calcium chloride solution for a longer time (8 h) had no impact on increasing the viability of encapsulated bacteria in a simulated gastric environment. The release of encapsulated cells at different phosphate buffer concentrations was also studied. When encapsulated L. acidophilus CSCC 2400 and L. acidophilus CSCC 2409 were subjected to low pH (pH 2) and high bile concentration (1.0% bile) under optimal encapsulation conditions (1.8% (w/v) alginate, 10(9) CFU/ml, 30 min hardening in 0.1 M CaCl(2) and capsule size 450 microm), there was a significant increase (p<0.05) in viable cell counts, compared to the free cells under similar conditions. Thus the encapsulation method described in this study may be effectively used to protect the lactobacillus from adverse gastric conditions.

TI  - Chemopreventive effect of a probiotic preparation on the development of preneoplastic and neoplastic colonic lesions: an experimental study.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: A number of studies have suggested a key role played by certain  resident gut bacteria in the development of large bowel cancer. The aim of the present study was to test the effect of a novel symbiotic preparation, which has been recently shown to beneficially modify gut ecosystem and systemic immunity, on either preneoplastic and neoplastic changes in a colon carcinogenesis model. METHODOLOGY: Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a standard diet for 1 week and then were randomly assigned to three groups. The control diet was given to groups A and B, whereas in group C, the same diet plus 2 mL of a probiotic mixture was given throughout the experiment. Thirty rats (groups B, C) each received a weekly subcutaneous injection of azoxymethane at a dose of 15 mg/kg of body weight for 10 weeks. Group A served as a control group and received a subcutaneous injection of saline for 10 weeks. Forty-five rats were sacrificed at 3-week observation and 60 rats at 20-week observation for assessing metaphase index together with aberrant crypt foci and intestinal immune system markers from one hand and tumor occurrence from the other, respectively. RESULTS: Group A showed a significantly increased metaphase index either in aberrant crypt foci or in "normal appearing" crypts when compared to group A (p < 0.01). Group B rats caused a significant decrease at both sites (p < 0.05). The numbers of lymphocytes derived from the mesenteric lymph nodes in group B rats were significantly decreased (p < 0.01) as compared to either control and to group C. The percentage of CD8 lymphocytes in group C was significantly higher than that in group B. Group C showed a significantly reduced ratio of aberrant crypt foci/colon and of aberrant crypt per colon and per each single focus (p < 0.05). A total of 18 (90%) group B and 10 (50%) group C rats had colon tumors, this difference was significant. The mean number of colon tumors per rat was 2.2 and 1.0 in group B and C, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Effective probiotics treatment, through mechanisms still to be fully elucidated (decreased fecal pH, specific reduction of carcinogenetic bacterial enzymes, modulation of gut-associated and systemic immune system etc.) has the potential to exert significant antimutagenic properties against colon cancer.
TI  - Utilisation of hydrogen peroxide in the treatment of recurrent bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - AIM: The authors have evaluated the real efficacy of using hydrogen peroxide for  previously treated recurrent bacterial vaginosis that is resistant to other forms of treatment. METHODS: The study included 58 women aged between 18 and 42 years old. Vaginal irrigations with 30 ml of hydrogen peroxide (3%) were prescribed in the evening for a week. The follow-up was carried out 3 months after the end of treatment. RESULTS: The results clearly show that the use of hydrogen peroxide in vagina can eliminate the main symptoms of bacterial vaginosis, and in particular the malodorous leucoxanthorrhea in 89% of cases at 3 months after the end of treatment, a result that is comparable to that obtained using metronidazole or clindamycin as a vaginal cream. Moreover, hydrogen peroxide facilitates the restoration of normal vaginal bacterial flora (represented by H202-producing lactobacillus) in 100% of cases and normal acid pH (pH<4.5) in 98% of cases; it also fosters the disappearance of clue cells from vaginal smears and anaerobic pathogenic flora from vaginal secretions in 100% of cases. The amine test became negative in 97.8% of cases. All results underwent statistical analysis and were found to be statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Hydrogen peroxide represents a valid alternative to conventional treatments for recurrent bacterial vaginosis, and associates the absence of collateral effects with low costs, excellent tolerability and real therapeutic efficacy.
TI  - [Efficient prevention of prematurity - the Thuringian model].
AB  - In two prospective projects, the effectiveness of the self-care programme for prematurity prevention developed by Saling was prevented. Pregnant women in Erfurt were shown how to perform self-measurements of their vaginal pH by means of test gloves twice a week in order to screen for any disturbances in the vaginal millieu. The women were instructed to see their physician immediately, if abnormal values (ph > or = 4.7) or other risk factors were present, in order to start Lactobacillus acidophilus therapy or, in cases of bacterial vaginosis, treatment with intravaginal clindamycin cream. Patients who were not interested in the programme, served as a control group. 73 out of 381 women in the intervention group were identified as risk cases. In this study, the prematurity rate was 8.1% in the self-measurement/intervention group versus 12.3% in the control group (p < 0.05, n = 2,341); 0.3 versus 3.3% of the neonates belonged to the group of very early prematures with a gestational age of <32 + 0 weeks (p < 0.01). Starting on March 1, 2000, a similar statewide pH screening programme was initiated in order to reduce prematurity in the State of Thuringia. According to the study design, a significant decrease in prematurity was hypothetically expected for the second half of 2000. Data from 16,276 women are available. On this basis, a significant reduction of early prematurity from 1.58 to 0.99% was seen (p < 0.001). Comparing low birth weights, a significant reduction of cases was also achieved in all groups. On the basis of data obtained, we recommend that the campaign should be extended to the whole of Germany. This recommendation is also supported by the observation that after the campaign had been discontinued the prematurity rates monitored in 2002 were as high as they had been prior to the introduction of the statewide programme.
TI  - The lactobin A and amylovorin L471 encoding genes are identical, and their distribution seems to be restricted to the species Lactobacillus amylovorus that is of interest for cereal fermentations.
AB  - Lactobin A and amylovorin L471 are two bacteriocins produced by the phenotypically different strains Lactobacillus amylovorus LMG P-13139 and L. amylovorus DCE 471, respectively. A 110-bp PCR fragment of the structural gene of lactobin A was obtained from total genomic DNA of L. amylovorus LMG P-13139, which was used as a probe to isolate a 3.6-kb HindIII chromosomal fragment for sequencing. PCR amplification revealed that both the structural genes of both the bacteriocins lactobin A and amylovorin L471 were identical. These bacteriocins will be further referred to as amylovorin L. Amylovorin L can be defined as a small, strongly hydrophobic, antibacterial peptide consisting of 50 amino acids. It is synthesized as a precursor peptide of 65 amino acids processed at a characteristic double-glycine proteolytic cleavage site. Amylovorin L hence belongs to the class II bacteriocins. It has a narrow inhibitory spectrum, being most active towards Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus LMG 6901(T). Among 38 strains of the Lactobacillus acidophilus DNA homology group, another 6 L. amylovorus strains were also inhibitory towards the L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus LMG 6901(T) strain. The lactobin A or amylovorin L471 structural genes could be detected in the genomes of three of these L. amylovorus strains, but only after extensive PCR amplification, indicating that the inhibitory substances were slightly different. The bacteriocins were characterized as small (approximately 4800 Da), heat-stable peptides that were active in a wide pH range (2.2-8.0). Finally, preliminary experiments indicated that the production of amylovorin L by L. amylovorus DCE 471 took place during a natural rye fermentation, indicating its potential importance in the development of a functional (probiotic) starter culture for cereal fermentations.
TI  - Lactobacillus kitasatonis sp. nov., from chicken intestine.
AB  - Four strains isolated from chicken small intestine and strains JCM 1038 and JCM 1039 (designated as Lactobacillus acidophilus) were characterized by phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. They were Gram-positive, catalase-negative, facultatively anaerobic rods that did not produce gas from glucose. These strains had similar phenotypic characteristics and exhibited intergroup DNA relatedness values of >77 %, indicating that they comprised a single species. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of a representative strain, JCM 1039(T) (designated as type strain in this study), was determined and aligned with those of other Lactobacillus species. JCM 1039(T) was placed in the Lactobacillus delbrueckii cluster of the genus Lactobacillus on the basis of phylogenetic analysis and formed an independent cluster that was distinct from its closest neighbours, Lactobacillus amylovorus, Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus gallinarum, L. acidophilus and Lactobacillus helveticus. Results of DNA-DNA hybridization experiments and whole-cell protein profiles clearly indicated that these strains represent a novel Lactobacillus species, for which the name Lactobacillus kitasatonis sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain of this species is JCM 1039(T).
TI  - [Use of molecular methods in food microbiology with the example of probiotic use  of lactobacilli].
AB  - The aim of molecular methods in food microbiology is the identification or strain specific differentiation of microorganisms. Identification methods include besides taxonomic purposes also the detection of virulence genes or resistance markers. Strain specific differentiation is used for epidemiological investigations or the quality control of technologically used bacteria. Probiotic strains of the Lactobacillus acidophilus-group were investigated with different molecular methods: for identification proteinfingerprinting and RAPD-PCR (Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA-PCR) were applied, for strain specific differentiation pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and again RAPD-PCR were used. The molecular methods applied should be chosen depending on the objective (identification, differentiation) and with respect to the organism to be tested. In case of probiotic lactic acid bacteria like the L. acidophilus-group proteinfingerprinting has proved to be successful for identification and with some limitation also RAPD-PCR. For differentiation PFGE is suitable as well as RAPD-PCR. Those methods differ substantially in their work load and in personal requirements, and show different power of discrimination and reproducibility within and between laboratories. This should be considered while choosing the appropriate method.

TI  - Survival of Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 and Bifidobacterium bifidum BB-02 in white-brined cheese.
AB  - The viability of probiotic cultures used as adjunct cultures including Bifidobacterium bifidum BB-02 and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 in white-brined cheese was investigated. The microbiological and biochemical properties of cheeses were assessed throughout 90 days of storage. Two inoculum rates for probiotic starters (2.5% and 5.0%, v/v, corresponding to (1.0-1.3)x10(9) cfu/g and (2.0-2.1)x10(9) cfu/g, respectively) were compared with the control cheese. Results obtained showed that a higher inoculum rate resulted in faster proteolysis. The cheese inoculated with 5% probiotic strains had higher water-soluble nitrogen, non-protein nitrogen, proteose-peptone nitrogen and tyrosine values than the other experimental cheeses. At the end of storage, the cheese supplemented with 5% probiotic culture had a ripening coefficient of 28.3%, followed by 2.5% probiotic strains containing the sample being 24.9%, and the control being 23.6%, respectively. It was also found that the colony counts of both probiotic microorganisms declined during storage. After 90 days of storage, the number of probiotic colonies were still around the threshold for a minimum probiotic effect (10(6) cfu/g).
TI  - Growth and lactic acid production by vaginal Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 1259,  and inhibition of uropathogenic Escherichia coli.
AB  - Lactic acid-producing lactobacilli were selected from 134 human vaginal isolates  by testing their capability to inhibit the growth of different pathogenic micro-organisms. Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 1259 (from the CERELA Culture Collection) was selected to study the effects of temperature, pH and culture medium on growth and lactic acid production. Growth parameters were estimated by using the model of Gompertz. Kinetics of inhibition of uropathogenic Escherichia coli were evaluated in mixed cultures of the pathogen and L. acidophilus. Optimal conditions for growth and lactic acid production by L. acidophilus were pH 6.5 or 8.0 and 37 degrees C. Under these conditions, growth was higher in LAPTg (yeast extract/peptone/tryptone/Tween 80/glucose) broth than in MRS (De Man-Rogosa-Sharpe) broth. However, lactic acid production was more efficient in MRS broth. Under optimal conditions for lactic acid production, L. acidophilus inhibited the growth of E. coli. These results suggest that inclusion of L. acidophilus CRL 1259 in probiotic products for vaginal application would be beneficial.
TI  - Microbiology and management of endodontic infections in children.
AB  - The first step in the origination of caries is the formation of a dental plaque.  Dental caries can lead to destruction of enamel and dentin resulting in bacterial invasion of the pulp. Invasion of the pulp and the periapical areas can promote the development of dento-alveolar abscess and spread of the infection to other anatomical areas. Several oral acid producing aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Actinomyces viscosus, are capable of initiating the carious lesion. The organisms that predominate in pulpitis and dento-alveolar abscess are Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, and Peptostreptococcus spp. Treatment of caries involves removal of all affected tooth structure and proper replacement with a restorative material. Once pulpitis has developed the infected tissue should be removed and root canal therapy instituted, or the tooth should be extracted. Extraction, root canal therapy and/or drainage of pus usually are indicated for an abscess. Antimicrobial therapy supplementing the dental care should be considered, especially when local or systemic spread of the infection is suspected. Penicillin or amoxicillin are generally effective against most of the aerobic and anaerobic bacteria recovered. The patient whose oral cavity may harbor penicillin-resistant organisms should be considered for treatment with drugs effective against these organisms. These agents include amoxicillin-clavulanate, clindamycin or the combination of metronidazole plus amoxicillin or a macrolide.
TI  - Detection and identification of Lactobacillus species in crops of broilers of different ages by using PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis.
AB  - The microflora of the crop was investigated throughout the broiler production period (0 to 42 days) using PCR combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and selective bacteriological culture of lactobacilli followed by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA). The birds were raised under conditions similar to those used in commercial broiler production. Lactobacilli predominated and attained populations of 10(8) to 10(9) CFU per gram of crop contents. Many of the lactobacilli present in the crop (61.9% of isolates) belonged to species of the Lactobacillus acidophilus group and could not be differentiated by PCR-DGGE. A rapid and simple ARDRA method was developed to distinguish between the members of the L. acidophilus group. HaeIII-ARDRA was used for preliminary identification of isolates in the L. acidophilus group and to identify Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus salivarius. MseI-ARDRA generated unique patterns for all species of the L. acidophilus group, identifying Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus johnsonii, and Lactobacillus gallinarum among crop isolates. The results of our study provide comprehensive knowledge of the Lactobacillus microflora in the crops of birds of different ages using nucleic acid-based methods of detection and identification based on current taxonomic criteria.
TI  - Effects of live cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus (strains NP45 and NP51) and Propionibacterium freudenreichii on performance, carcass, and intestinal characteristics, and Escherichia coli strain O157 shedding of finishing beef steers.
AB  - In Exp. 1, 240 beef steers (initial BW = 332.8 kg) were used to determine the effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) plus Propionibacterium freudenreichii (PF) on performance, carcass, and intestinal characteristics; serum IgA concentrations; and the prevalence of Escherichia coli O157 (EC). Cattle were fed a steam-flaked corn-based, 92% concentrate diet, and the four direct-fed microbial (DFM) treatments (12 pens/treatment) included in a randomized complete block design were as follows: 1) control, lactose carrier only (CON); 2) 1 x 10(9) cfu of LA NP51 plus 1 x 10(6) cfu of LA NP45 plus 1 x 10(9) cfu of PF NP24 per animal daily (LA45-51H); 3) 1 x 10(9) cfu of LA NP51 plus 1 x 10(9) cfu of PF NP24 per animal daily (LA51); and 4) 1 x 10(6) cfu of LA NP51 plus 1 x 10(6) cfu of LA NP45 plus 1 x 10(9) cfu of PF NP24 per animal daily (LA45-51L). No differences (P > 0.10) were detected for pen-based performance data. The average lamina propria thickness for LA51 and LA45-51H steers was less (P = 0.02) than the average for CON and LA45-51L steers. Moreover, LA51 and LA45-51H steers had a lower (P = 0.06) prevalence of EC shedding than CON and LA45-51L steers. In Exp. 2, 660 steers fed 91% concentrate, steam-flaked corn-based diets were used to determine the effects of the following DFM treatments (10 pens/treatment) on performance, carcass, and intestinal characteristics: 1) control, lactose carrier only (CON); 2) 5 x 10(6) cfu of LA NP51 plus 5 x 10(6) cfu of LA NP45 plus 1 x 10(9) cfu of PF NP24 per animal daily (LA45-51L); and 3) 1 x 10(9) cfu of LA NP51 plus 5 x 10(6) cfu of LA NP45 plus 1 x 10(9) cfu of PF NP24 per animal daily (LA45-51H). Steers were from two weight groups (WG). One group (SDOF; BW at arrival = 351.5 kg) had grazed before arrival, and the other group (LDOF; BW at arrival = 314 kg) had been in a grower yard. A split plot was used with WG as the whole-plot factor and DFM in the split plot. There was an interaction of WG and DFM for ADG (P = 0.05) and for carcass-adjusted ADG (P = 0.08). The simple-effect ADG and carcass-adjusted ADG means for DFM treatments differed (P < or = 0.01) between WG classifications. Within SDOF, ADG for CON and LA45-51L did not differ (P = 0.70), but both were less (P < or = 0.08) than for LA45-51H. Overall, these data indicate that live cultures of LA plus PF did not greatly affect feedlot performance and carcass characteristics. Some of the DFM used decreased fecal EC shedding, which might be related to the results for ileal lamina propria thickness.
TI  - The antimicrobial properties of different strains of Lactobacillus spp. isolated  from kefir.
AB  - The characteristics of 58 strains of Lactobacillus spp. isolated from kefir were  studied. These strains were tested for adherence to human enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells, resistance to acidic pH and bile acid, antimicrobial activities against enteropathogenic bacteria and inhibition of Salmonella typhimurium attachment to Caco-2 cells. The best probiotic properties were observed in L. acidophilus CYC 10051 and L. kefiranofaciens CYC 10058. L. kefiranofaciens CYC 10058 produced an exopolysaccharide, which revealed that it was closely related to kefiran, a polysaccharide with antitumoral properties. This is the first in vitro study about the antimicrobial characteristics of the Lactobacillus population of kefir.
TI  - Effect of sodium chloride on growth and bacteriocin production by Lactobacillus amylovorus DCE 471.
AB  - A kinetic investigation of the effect of sodium chloride on cell growth of Lactobacillus amylovorus DCE 471 and amylovorin L471 production was carried out through in vitro experiments using a temperature and pH prevailing during sourdough fermentations. Sodium chloride interfered both with cell growth and bacteriocin production. Biomass formation and amylovorin L471 production decreased in the presence of increasing salt concentrations. Maximum bacteriocin activities were observed after the addition of 10 g l(-1) of NaCl, while the maximum specific growth rate reached an optimum at 5 g l(-1) of NaCl. High salt concentrations (20-40 g l(-1)) resulted in biphasic fermentation profiles. Based on these results, incorporation of 5-10 g l(-1) of sodium chloride in the water phase of type II sourdough preparations might be beneficial to enhance bacterial growth and amylovorin L471 production, and so contribute to the competitiveness of the strain in a sourdough environment.
TI  - The role of probiotics in the treatment and prevention of Helicobacter pylori infection.
AB  - Literature reporting activity of probiotics in infections due to Helicobacter pylori has been reviewed to assess their value in combating such infections. Several in vitro studies show that lactobacilli or their cell-free cultures inhibit or kill H. pylori, prevent its adhesion to mammalian epithelial cells and prevent IL8 release. In vivo models demonstrate that pre-treatment with a probiotic can prevent H. pylori infections and/or that administration of probiotics markedly reduced an existing infection. Thirteen clinical trials have been published. In six (180 patients), a probiotic was used alone; five of these had an encouraging result-in three there were significantly reduced breath test readings and in two others some patients were cleared of infection. In seven further trials (682 patients), probiotics were added to a therapeutic regimen of antibiotics, resulting in an increased cure rate in two studies, and reduced side-effects in four. Trials in which fermented milk products or whole cultures of lactobacilli were used tended to show better results than when the probiotic was taken in the form of bacteria alone. Not all the studies were randomised, double-blind and placebo controlled, and some involved only small numbers of patients. The results suggest that probiotics may have a place as adjunctive treatment in H. pylori infections and possibly in prophylaxis. Future trials should address in particular the type of patient (asymptomatic volunteers, symptomatic patients), choice of probiotic strain(s), a wide range of probiotic strains (Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. johnsonii, L. gasseri, lactobacillus GG, Bifidobacterium longum, and bioyoghurts) have been used-some non-viable, regimens (doses and duration) and criteria of success (breath test, histology, culture, serology).
TI  - Effect of Lactobacillus strains and Saccharomyces boulardii on persistent diarrhea in children.
AB  - The efficacy of probiotics on persistent diarrhea remains uncertain. The purpose  of this study was to evaluate the effect of Lactobacillus sp and Saccharomyces boulardii on persistent diarrhea in children. In a double-blind trial eighty-nine children, aged 6-24 months were randomly distributed to receive pasteurized cow milk containing 2 viable lyophilized strains Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophillus strains CERELA, (10(10)-10(12) colony-forming units per g) (n = 30), or lyophilized S. boulardii, (10(10)-10(12) colony forming units per g) (n = 30) or pasteurized cow milk as placebo (n = 29); on each diet 175 g was given twice a day for a 5 day period. Number of depositions, duration of illness and frequency of vomiting were considered. Enteric pathogens were isolated from stools in 40% of the patients, 27% had rotavirus. Lactobacillus and S. boulardii significantly reduced the number of depositions (p < 0.001) and diarrheal duration (p < 0.005). Similarly both significantly (p < 0.002) reduced vomiting as compared with placebo. There was no difference between treatments depending on rotavirus status. In conclusion, L. casei and L. acidophillus strains CERELA and S. boulardii are useful in the management of persistent diarrhea in children.
TI  - Activity of human beta-defensin 3 alone or combined with other antimicrobial agents against oral bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activities of human beta-defensin 3 (hBD-3) alone or combined with lysozyme, metronidazole, amoxicillin, and chlorhexidine were investigated with the oral bacteria Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. hBD-3 showed bactericidal activity against all of the bacterial species tested. The bactericidal effect was enhanced when the peptide was used in combination with the antimicrobial agents mentioned above.
TI  - Application of ultrasound-assisted thermal processing for preservation and quality retention of liquid foods.
AB  - A continuously working pilot plant-scale prototype was used to evaluate the effects of continuous-flow ultrasound-temperature treatment for bacterial decontamination of model suspensions and various liquid food systems such as milk, fruit, and vegetable juices. Escherichia coli K12 DH 5 alpha and Lactobacillus acidophilus were used as test microorganisms. In addition, treated juices were investigated for damage caused by heat or ultrasound-induced degradation of sensory and nutritional properties after treatment and storage. Changes in color and destruction of heat-labile and slightly oxidizable L-ascorbic acid content were monitored as an index to measure processing effects. Results were assessed with respect to the total energy requirement and compared with those using a conventional, indirect heating method having similar processing conditions. For the bacteriological process evaluation, the temperature- and time-dependent process lethality was used as the basis; for the quality- and energy-related investigations, the degree of bacterial inactivation was used. At identical degrees of bacterial inactivation, the ultrasound-assisted thermal treatments required a lower processing temperature than treatment with conventional thermal processing. However, according to energy balances, the total energy consumption was not reduced compared to conventional heating. Indications for a positive influence on shelf life, with improvements in surface color stability (lightness) and L-ascorbic acid retention, were found among quality parameters of treated orange juice.
TI  - Bacterial gene expression detected in human faeces by reverse transcription-PCR.
AB  - A method to isolate and specifically detect bacterial messenger RNA (mRNA) in human faeces is presented. The surface layer protein gene slpA of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356(T) was chosen as a model system because it is transcribed at a high level to a relatively stable mRNA (Boot et al., 1996, J. Bacteriol. 178, 5388-5394). A simulation of the recovery of bacterial cells in the faecal ecosystem was achieved by spiking faecal homogenates with different levels of L. acidophilus cells and total RNA was isolated using a method based on Macaloid clay. The slpA transcript could be detected by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) when the L. acidophilus cells comprised more than 0.14% (approximately 2 x 10(7) cells g(-1) faeces) of the complex faecal community.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the fermentation properties of galactooligosaccharides synthesised by alpha-galactosidase from Lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  - Stirred, pH-controlled anaerobic batch cultures were used to evaluate the in vitro utilisation by canine gut microflora of novel alpha-galactooligosaccharides synthesised with an enzyme extract from a canine Lactobacillus reuteri strain. Fructooligosaccharides (FOS), melibiose and raffinose were used as reference carbohydrates for the prebiotic properties of the synthesised oligosaccharide (galactosyl melibiose mixture-GMM). Addition of Lactobacillus acidophilus was used as control for the evaluation of the synbiotic properties of the oligosaccharide with L. reuteri. Populations of predominant gut bacterial groups were monitored over 48 h of batch culture by fluorescent in situ hybridisation, and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production was measured. GMM showed a higher increase in bifidobacteria and lactobacilli population number and size as well as a higher decrease in clostridia population number and size compared to the commercial prebiotics (FOS, melibiose, raffinose). This prebiotic effect was further increased by the addition of L. reuteri followed by a change in the SCFA production pattern compared to GMM alone or GMM with L. acidophilus. The observed change in SCFA production was in accordance with the fermentation properties of L. reuteri, suggesting that the novel synbiotic had a significant effect on the canine gut microflora fermentation.
TI  - Effect of spermicides on Lactobacillus acidophilus in vitro-nonoxynol-9 vs. Sapindus saponins.
AB  - Saponins extracted from the fruit pericarp of Sapindus mukorosii were tested for  their bactericidal/bacteriostatic property against Lactobacillus acidophilus. Nonoxynol-9 was used as a reference compound for the comparison of activity. Lactobacillus colonies were grown on specific medium (Rogosa SL agar) containing different concentrations of saponins and nonoxynol-9 in an atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air at 37 degrees C for 72 h. The number and size of colonies were recorded at the end of the experiment and compared with controls. Results indicated that nearly 90% of Lactobacillus colonies with minor reduction in size thrived at 0.05% concentration of saponins whereas only 18% of colonies with approximately 75% reduction in size grew in dishes containing 0.05% nonoxynol-9. At higher concentrations of saponins, there was a gradual, dose-dependent reduction in the number and size of colonies and at 2.5% concentration there was an approximately 55% reduction in the number and 60% reduction in the size of surviving colonies. No lactobacillus colonies, however, grew in dishes containing 0.1% and higher concentrations of nonoxynol-9. The studies indicate that Sapindus saponins as compared to nonoxynol-9 are far less toxic to lactobacillus species and therefore saponins containing spermicidal preparations are likely to be more vaginal-friendly than equivalent nonoxynol-9 preparations.
TI  - Metabolic and biochemical responses of probiotic bacteria to oxygen.
AB  - The interaction between oxygen and probiotic bacteria was studied by growing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium spp. in 0, 5, 10, 15, and 21% oxygen in a hypoxic glove box. The metabolic responses of each probiotic strain in the different oxygen environments were monitored by measuring the levels of lactic acid and determining the lactate-to-acetate ratio. Biochemical changes induced by oxygen were examined by monitoring the specific activities of NADH oxidase, NADH peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase. In addition, the ability to decompose hydrogen peroxide and the sensitivity of each strain to hydrogen peroxide was also determined. With an increase in oxygen percentage, levels of lactic acid in L. acidophilus strains decreased, whereas the lactate-to-acetate ratio reduced in all the bifidobacteria tested. At 21% oxygen, the specific activities of NADH oxidase and NADH peroxidase, and the hydrogen peroxide decomposing ability of five probiotic strains was significantly higher than at 0% oxygen. The sensitivity of the probiotic strains to hydrogen peroxide however, remained unaffected in all the different oxygen percentages. Superoxide dismutase levels did not reveal any conclusive trend. In both L. acidophilus and Bifidobacterium spp., NADH oxidase and NADH peroxidase functioned optimally at pH 5. Growth in the various oxygen environments did not change this optimum pH.
TI  - Growth and metabolism of selected strains of probiotic bacteria in milk.
AB  - Growth and metabolism of five probiotic strains with well-documented health effects were studied in ultra-high temperature (UHT) treated milk, supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) tryptone or 0.75% (w/v) fructose. The probiotic strains were Lactobacillus acidophilus La5, Lb. acidophilus 1748, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus reuteri SD 2112 and Bifidobacterium animalis BB12. Fermentation was followed for 72 h at 37 degrees C and the samples were analysed for pH, log cfu ml(-1), volatile compounds, organic acids and carbon dioxide. The strains reduced pH from 6.7 to between 3.9 and 4.4 after 24 h of incubation. All strains attained viable cell counts above 8.7-9.18 log cfu ml(-1) after 6-16 h of incubation. The two Lb. acidophilus strains showed a stable level of viable cells during 12-72 h of incubation but the three other strains showed a reduction of 0.4-1.1 log cfu ml(-1) from 24 to 72 h of incubation. However, all strains showed cell levels between 7.8 and 8.7 log cfu ml(-1) after 72 h of incubation. After 48 h of incubation, the amount of lactic acid produced varied according to strain from 6949 to 14,000 mg kg(-1) and acetic acid produced varied from 0 to 6901 mg kg(-1). Three of the strains metabolised citrate but only low amounts of diacetyl and acetoin were detected within strains, 0.2-0.8 and 6.5-10 mg kg(-1), respectively. Carbon dioxide produced varied from 221 to 3942 mg kg(-1) and was connected to the citrate-fermenting ability of the strain used and their carbohydrate fermentation pathway. Three of the strains produced detectable levels of acetaldehyde and the concentration varied from 9.4 to 12.6 mg kg(-1) after 24 h of incubation. All five probiotic strains showed very different profiles of metabolites during fermentation; however, the two Lb. acidophilus strains were the most alike. Our findings show the importance of controlling the fermentation time since the probiotic strains produced different amounts of metabolic products according to fermentation time.
TI  - Andean yacon root (Smallanthus sonchifolius Poepp. Endl) fructooligosaccharides as a potential novel source of prebiotics.
AB  - The ability of three known probiotic strains (two lactobacilli and one bifidobacterium) to ferment fructooligosaccharides (FOS) from yacon roots (Smallanthus sonchifolius Poepp. Endl) was compared to commercial FOS in this study. Results indicate that Lactobacillus acidophilus NRRL-1910, Lactobacillus plantarum NRRL B-4496, and Bifidobacterium bifidum ATCC 15696 were able to ferment yacon root FOS. FOS consumption apparently depended on the degree of polymerization and the initial FOS composition. L. plantarum NRRL B-4496 and L. acidophilus NRRL B-1910 completely utilized 1-kestose molecules, while B. bifidum was able to utilize 1-kestose molecules as well as molecules with a higher degree of polymerization.
TI  - Microbial ingrowth around single- and multi-component adhesives studied in vitro.
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the in vitro microbial leakage in 4 micro-hybrid composites in combination with 4 single-component dental adhesives (Scotchbond 1/Z100 MP = group 1; Syntac Single-Component/Tetric Flow = group 3; OptiBond Solo/XRV Herculite = group 5; Solobond M/Arabesk Top = group 7) and 4 multi-component dental adhesives (Scotchbond Multi-Purpose/Z100 MP = group 2; Syntac/Tetric Flow = group 4; OptiBond FL/XRV Herculite = group 6; Solobond Plus/Arabesk Top = group 8). Ninety-four mixed standardized Class V cavities of human caries-free extracted premolars were filled with eight different composite adhesive systems using a one-layer (groups 1-4) or a two-layer technique (groups 5-8). After thermocycling and incubation in a broth culture of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus, followed by decalcification and staining, the extent and the type of microbial leakage were measured histologically. The extent of microbial leakage in the composite restorations was very low in all groups and there were no significant differences between adhesives. Z100 MP in combination with single- and multi-component adhesives showed a significantly higher microbial leakage than Tetric Flow systems (U test: p=0.037). XRV Herculite adhesive systems showed significantly less extensive microbial leakage than Arabesk Top adhesive systems (U test: p<0.001). The single-component dental adhesives achieved a marginal adaptation of composites comparable to that of multi-component adhesives in vitro.
TI  - Partial purification and characterization of the bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus YIT 0154.
AB  - One strain of Lactobacillus acidophilus was found to produce a bacteriocin-like substance in the culture filtrate. The substance was produced in a growth-associated manner, showed heat stability at neutral and acidic pH and exhibited antibacterial activity against various species of Lactobacillus including L. acidophilus itself. The molecular weight of the substance was in the range of 6.2-95 kDa. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis suggests that the substance may belong to class IIb bacteriocin.
TI  - Selective enumeration of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacteria, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and propionibacteria.
AB  - Nineteen bacteriological media were evaluated to assess their suitability to selectively enumerate Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacteria, and propionibacteria. Bacteriological media evaluated included Streptococcus thermophilus agar, pH modified MRS agar, MRS-vancomycine agar, MRS-bile agar, MRS-NaCl agar, MRS-lithium chloride agar, MRS-NNLP (nalidixic acid, neomycin sulfate, lithium chloride and paramomycine sulfate) agar, reinforced clostridial agar, sugar-based (such as maltose, galactose, sorbitol, manitol, esculin) media, sodium lactate agar, arabinose agar, raffinose agar, xylose agar, and L. casei agar. Incubations were carried out under aerobic and anaerobic conditions at 27, 30, 37, 43, and 45 degrees C for 24, 72 h, and 7 to 9 d. S. thermophilus agar and aerobic incubation at 37 degrees C for 24 h were suitable for S. thermophilus. L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus could be enumerated using MRS agar (pH 4.58 or pH 5.20) and under anaerobic incubation at 45 degrees C for 72 h. MRS-vancomycine agar and anaerobic incubation at 43 degrees C for 72 h were suitable to enumerate L. rhamnosus. MRS-vancomycine agar and anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees C for 72 h were selective for L. casei. To estimate the counts of L. casei by subtraction method, counts of L. rhamnosus on MRS-vancomycine agar at 43 degrees C for 72 h under anaerobic incubation could be subtracted from total counts of L. casei and L. rhamnosus enumerated on MRS-vancomycine agar at 37 degrees C for 72 h under anaerobic incubation. L. acidophilus could be enumerated using MRS-agar at 43 degrees C for 72 h or Basal agar-maltose agar at 43 degrees C for 72 h or BA-sorbitol agar at 37 degrees C for 72 h, under anaerobic incubation. Bifidobacteria could be enumerated on MRS-NNLP agar under anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees C for 72 h. Propionibacteria could be enumerated on sodium lactate agar under anaerobic incubation at 30 degrees C for 7 to 9 d. A subtraction method was most suitable for counting propionibacteria in the presence of other lactic acid bacteria from a product. For this method, counts of lactic bacteria at d 3 on sodium lactate agar under anaerobic incubation at 30 degrees C were subtracted from counts at d 7 of lactic bacteria and propionibacteria.
TI  - Calibrated latex microspheres percolation: a possible route to model endodontic bacterial leakage.
AB  - Endodontic therapy is conducted to effectively seal the root canal system. In vitro methods are used to estimate the quality of the seal, generally by measuring any microleakage that allows the tracers to penetrate along the obturated root canal. The use of bacteria as tracers seems to give the most clinically relevant demonstration of microleakage associated with a root canal system. Many bacterial strains have been used to evaluate marginal leakage, but results are sometimes contradictory, probably because they may depend on the bacterial strain used. In the studies described in this article, the percolation of both calibrated latex microspheres equivalent in diameter (0.4-9.5 microm) to bacteria and three bacterial strains (Actinomyces odontolyticus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Pseudomonas fluorescens) was compared in teeth filled using noncompressive and compressive techniques. The depth (d) to which the microspheres and bacteria penetrated varied over the time (t) of contamination according to a logarithmic relation. The slope (S) and the intercept (I, corresponding to penetration after 1 month) of the d = f(In t) plots can serve to quantify penetration over time. Statistical analysis of I by the Newman-Keuls procedure, which couples the tracers and filling techniques, showed that A. odontolyticus and L. acidophilus behave like 4.8-microm particles and P. fluorescens like 2.2-microm particles (corresponding approximately to their size in length) and that noncompressive techniques are less hermetic than compressive techniques. S and I are in direct relation and this relation is independent of the filling technique. Moreover, for the calibrated particles, both I and S varied linearly with the inverse of the square root of the particle diameter, indicating that their displacements are governed solely by Brownian movements and the penetration over time is caused by diffusion phenomena. The size of the tracer is the predominant factor governing its penetration. Inert particles mimic bacterial percolation into the marginal hiatus and can thus be used to model this percolation and establish a relative scale of the behavior of different bacteria during percolation.
TI  - In vitro growth responses of bifidobacteria and enteropathogens to bovine and human lactoferrin.
AB  - A series of in vitro experiments was performed to test the ability of bovine and  human lactoferrin to influence the growth of the gram-positive probiotic bacteria, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium infantis, and Lactobacillus acidophilus, as well as the gram-negative enteric bacteria, E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella typhimurium. None of the lactoferrin preparations stimulated the growth of the tested strains. However, iron-free apo-lactoferrin (bovine and human) and 66% iron-saturated bovine lactoferrin dramatically slowed the growth of E. coli O157:H7 in single culture experiments, while 98% iron-saturated preparations had no effect. In coculture experiments of B. infantis and E. coli, the iron-limited preparations of lactoferrin also slowed the growth of the latter without inhibiting the bifidobacteria. These results suggest that lactoferrin in iron-limited forms may have the potential to be combined with probiotic bacteria in biotherapeutic products, which could help balance human gut microflora and limit the overgrowth of certain enteric microorganisms.
TI  - [Evaluation of the activity of probiotic cultures over Listeria monocytogenes during the production and storage of yogurt].
AB  - The effect of probiotic cultures over Listeria monocytogenes during the production and storage of yogurt was evaluated. A yogurt mixture (10.6% non-fat solid liquids, 3% fat and 0.3% gelatin) was prepared, homogenized and pasteurized. Yogurt was inoculated with 0, 10(2), 10(4) and 10(6) CFU/mL of L. monocytogenes and 0.02% of traditional lactic culture YC 180 (Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus) and probiotic culture ABY-1 (Bifidobacterium longum, B. bifidum, B, infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus thermophilus y Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus). It was incubated for 3 h at 43 degrees C until pH reached an approximate value of 4.8, followed by refrigeration at 5 degrees C for 21 days. During fermentation, samples were taken every hour, and during storage every 3 days, analyzing pH and lactic, bifidobacteria and pathogen count for each time. It was demonstrated that there was no significant simple effect for the type of culture used (ABY-1 and YC 180) (p = 0.684) over the amount of L. monocytogenes present in yogurt during the fermentation and storage periods. The presence of bifidobacteria in the ABY-1 culture did not present a significant effect over L. monocytogenes. Neither the effect of time presented a significant effect over L. monocytogenes (p = 0.448). In this case, the ABY-1 and YC 180 cultures present a bacteriostatic effect over the pathogen. The probiotic cultures had a bacteriostatic but not bactericidal effect over L. monocytogenes. This is not related to the protective effect of these cultures in bowel, since in-vivo conditions favor the production of antimicrobial substances, such as bacteriocins that act over pathogens.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium lactis and Lactobacillus F19 prevent antibiotic-associated ecological disturbances of Bacteroides fragilis in the intestine.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the effect of clindamycin on the intestinal microflora in subjects ingesting yogurt with added probiotic microorganisms with the microflora in subjects ingesting placebo yogurt. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four healthy subjects were included in the study. All subjects received 150 mg clindamycin four times daily for 7 days and 250 ml yogurt twice daily for 14 days. Faecal samples were collected before, during and after administration of clindamycin. RESULTS: In the aerobic intestinal microflora, the numbers of enterococci increased after treatment in both groups, whereas other Gram-positive microorganisms decreased. In both groups, the numbers of Escherichia coli also decreased, whereas there was a concomitant increase in numbers of other Gram-negative bacilli. In the anaerobic microflora in subjects receiving yogurt with added microorganisms, the numbers of lactobacilli and bacteroides remained at the same levels throughout the study, whereas the numbers decreased in the placebo group. Other anaerobic bacteria decreased in both groups. The minimum inhibitory concentration of clindamycin against strains of bacteroides increased in both groups during the study. CONCLUSIONS: The probiotic microorganisms evaluated in this study prevented ecological disturbances in the numbers of intestinal Bacteroides fragilis group species during clindamycin administration.
TI  - Neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis: an overview.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Necrotizing enterocolitis represents a disease entity that remains quite challenging for neonatologists all around the world, in that its aetiology has yet to be revealed, but it is the cause of death for many premature infants each year, affecting up to 28% of very low birthweight infants. This is an attempt to improve the management of affected babies and stimulate more research concerning new diagnostic tools. RECENT FINDINGS: Current trends in the field of (early) diagnosis, such as: (1) imaging techniques, e.g. contrast radiography, portal vein ultrasonography, magnetic resonance, radionuclide scanning; (2) gastrointestinal tonometry; (3) the detection of biochemical markers, cytokines, growth factors; and (4) the determination of the mean peak hydrogen: carbon dioxide ratio excreted in breath, are only some of those mentioned. Various novel preventive techniques are also presented, among which platelet-activating factor acetyl hydrolase activity enhancement, platelet-activating factor receptor antagonists and probiotics, such as Bifidobacterium infantis and Lactobacillus acidophilus, seem quite promising. Regarding treatment, the use of oxygenated perfluorocarbon has added to the limited alternatives available. These data along with other recent discoveries concerning the risk factors and pathogenesis of this disease create a full picture of the current opinion on this topic. SUMMARY: Keeping in mind that the key to confronting such a devastating disorder as necrotizing enterocolitis is early diagnosis and prevention, both clinically applicable and experimental advances are presented with the hope of improving the survival rates of patients affected.
TI  - Functional and comparative genomic analyses of an operon involved in fructooligosaccharide utilization by Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus is a probiotic organism that displays the ability to use prebiotic compounds such as fructooligosaccharides (FOS), which stimulate the growth of beneficial commensals in the gastrointestinal tract. However, little is known about the mechanisms and genes involved in FOS utilization by Lactobacillus species. Analysis of the L. acidophilus NCFM genome revealed an msm locus composed of a transcriptional regulator of the LacI family, a four-component ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transport system, a fructosidase, and a sucrose phosphorylase. Transcriptional analysis of this operon demonstrated that gene expression was induced by sucrose and FOS but not by glucose or fructose, suggesting some specificity for nonreadily fermentable sugars. Additionally, expression was repressed by glucose but not by fructose, suggesting catabolite repression via two cre-like sequences identified in the promoter-operator region. Insertional inactivation of the genes encoding the ABC transporter substrate-binding protein and the fructosidase reduced the ability of the mutants to grow on FOS. Comparative analysis of gene architecture within this cluster revealed a high degree of synteny with operons in Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, the association between a fructosidase and an ABC transporter is unusual and may be specific to L. acidophilus. This is a description of a previously undescribed gene locus involved in transport and catabolism of FOS compounds, which can promote competition of beneficial microorganisms in the human gastrointestinal tract.
TI  - Production of free conjugated linoleic acid by Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei of human intestinal origin.
AB  - A gas chromatographic procedure was used for analysis of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomers cis-9, trans-11-octadecadienoic; trans-10, cis-12 octadecadienoic; and trans-9, trans-11-octadecadienoic (c9t11, t10c12, t9t11) produced by lactobacilli. Four different cultures, two strains each of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei were tested for their ability to produce CLA from free linoleic acid in MRS broth supplemented with linoleic acid. Different concentrations of linoleic acid (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 mg/ml) were added to MRS broth, inoculated with the lactobacilli, and incubated at 37 degrees C. Viable counts and amounts of individual isomers of CLA (c9t11, t10c12, t9t11) were measured at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h. All the cultures were able to produce free CLA in media supplemented with linoleic acid. Maximum production of CLA (80.14 to 131.63 microg/ml) was observed at 24 h of incubation in broth containing 0.02% of free linoleic acid. No significant (P > 0.05) increases in total CLA levels were observed after 24 h of incubation. The ability of the cultures to produce CLA in skim milk supplemented with 0.02% free linoleic acid also was studied. In this medium, the total amounts of free CLA after 24 h of incubation ranged from 54.31 to 116.53 microg/ml. The use of lactic acid bacteria able to form free CLA in cultured dairy products may have potential health or nutritional benefits. Free CLA in the products likely would be more readily available for absorption from the digestive tract than if it were incorporated into the cells of the starter culture.
TI  - Decrease in ovalbumin specific IgE of mice serum after oral uptake of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Different kinds of lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria fermented milk were fed to ovalbumin-specific IgE-elevated mice for 3 days, and after the final administration, changes in the ovalbumin-specific IgE values for each sample were compared to the value for non-fermented milk. Seven of the Lactobacillus-fermented milks caused a significant decrease in the serum ovalbumin-specific IgE levels. Above all, Lactobacillus acidophilus L92, Lactobacillus acidophilus CP1613, and Lactobacillus fermentum CP34 fermented milk had the most significant effects of decreasing the serum ovalbumin-specific IgE levels compared to a control group. The L. acidophilus L92 and L. fermentum CP34 cells also showed significant ovalbumin-specific IgE lowering activities. From these results, an active component seems to exist in the cells of L. acidophilus L92 and L. fermentum CP34 strains. Recovery of the radiolabeled L. acidophilus L92 and L. fermentum CP34 cells from the small intestine and the large intestine of the mouse 13 h after oral administration were higher than the recovery of any other strain.
TI  - Effect of Lactobacillus-fermented diets on bacterial translocation and intestinal flora in experimental prehepatic portal hypertension.
AB  - Spontaneous bacterial infections in cirrhosis and portal hypertension have been attributed to translocation of gut-derived bacteria, a process promoted by intestinal bacterial overgrowth and disruption of the gut mucosal barrier. Bacteriotherapy with Lactobacillus has been reported to correct bacterial overgrowth, stabilize mucosal barrier function, and decrease bacterial translocation in rat models of acute liver injury and failure. In this study we investigated the effect of Lactobacillus-supplemented diets on intestinal flora and on bacterial translocation rate in portal vein ligated rats. Lactobacillus-fermented milk (yogurt) containing at least 2 x 10(9) colony forming units/ml or placebo (water) was adminstrated by gavage twice daily (2 ml) for 9 days. Portal vein ligation was performed on day 7 of treatment. Bacterial translocation to mesenteric lymph nodes and quantification of intestinal flora was assessed by standard bacteriological cultures. Bacterial translocation was not significantly different between animals that received yogurt (82%) and those that received placebo (75%). Yogurt did not induce any significant changes in intestinal flora, whether it was produced with Lactobacillus acidophilus or Lactobacillus GG. In conclusion, in acute prehepatic portal hypertension, bacteriotherapy with Lactobacillus was unable to induce changes in bacterial translocation probably because it was unable to induce changes in bacterial flora.
TI  - The effect of processed meat and meat starter cultures on gastrointestinal colonization and virulence of Listeria monocytogenes in mice.
AB  - Listeria monocytogenes is a foodborne pathogen of major concern to the food industry in general and the meat industry in particular. The aim of this study was firstly to identify a strain of Listeria that was virulent in SPF BALB/c mice. Secondly, to investigate if a traditional meat starter culture (FloraCarn) and nontraditional meat starter (NTMS) cultures of dairy product and human origin (Lactobacillus and bifidobacteria) inhibit this pathogen in vivo. In addition, the inhibition of Listeria was investigated in vitro. In vitro inhibition was investigated using an agar inhibition assay, where soft agar containing the pathogen was laid over colonies of NTMS cultures, and inhibition expressed as the zones of inhibition developing around the colonies. For assessment of virulence, mice were intragastrically challenged with broth cultures of five strains of Listeria. For assessment of anti-listeria effect in vivo, the Listeria strain proven to be most pathogenic (LM3) was given to mice in salami batter containing no other added cultures (control) or batter inoculated with either (1) FloraCarn, (2) a NTMS culture, or (3) a combination of FloraCarn and a NTMS culture. The batter was given to mice after a 3-day fermentation and faecal levels of pathogen and body weight were monitored. Intragastric challenge with LM3, but no other strains, resulted in a significant weight loss (p<0.05) and up to 10(6) colony forming units (cfu) of LM3 per gram faeces. No weight loss was observed in animals fed with salami batter containing LM3. Consumption of salami batter fermented by a combination of NTMS culture (Lactobacillus acidophilus LAFTI(R) L10) and FloraCarn reduced faecal levels of the pathogen by 2.5 log units compared to the control. Consumption of salami batter fermented with FloraCarn and LAFTI(R) L10 (L10) alone reduced faecal levels by 0.5-1 and 1.5 log units, respectively. Of the NTMS cultures investigated here, L10 displayed the greatest inhibition of LM3 in vitro. These results indicate that the ability of pathogenic Listeria to cause listeriosis is dependent on the nature of the food in which the pathogen is present, and that a traditional meat starter culture (FloraCarn) and some NTMS cultures, particularly L10, inhibit growth of the pathogen during passage through the gastrointestinal tract.
TI  - The effect of temperature and pH on the growth of lactic acid bacteria: a pH-auxostat study.
AB  - The growth of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus paracasei was studied in a pH-auxostat. The computer-controlled smooth change of pH or temperature was used to study the effect of pH and temperature on the culture characteristics (specific growth rate mu growth yield Y(ATP) and specific lactate production rate Q(ATP)). The behaviour of mu and Q(ATP) with an increase of temperature suggested that ATP production capacity was an important factor in determining the maximum growth rate of lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The decrease of Y(ATP) with increase of temperature resulted in the decrease of specific growth rate while Q(ATP) remained constant or even increased. With the decrease of pH, decrease of both Y(ATP) and Q(ATP) was observed. S. thermophilus St20 having the highest maximum specific growth rate of 2.2 h(-1) at 44 degrees C was the most acid sensitive strain. The L. paracasei E1H3 having the lowest mu(max) was the most tolerant strain to pH change. The behaviour of mixed culture of L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus in milk in a pH-auxostat with pH-decrease was in agreement with the pure culture experiments of the same species. The study showed that pH-auxostat with smooth controlled change of pH and temperature is an effective method for determination of technological characteristics and comparative physiological study of LAB.
TI  - Growth-inhibiting effects of seco-tanapartholides identified in Artemisia princeps var. orientalis whole plant on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: The present work aimed at isolating antibacterial constituents from the whole plant of Artemisia princeps var. orientalis active towards nine human intestinal bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: The growth-inhibiting activities of materials derived from the Artemisia whole plant towards test bacteria were examined using an impregnated paper disc method. The biologically active constituents of the Artemisia whole plant were characterized as the sesquiterpene lactones seco-tanapartholides A and B by spectroscopic analysis. In a test using 1 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides A and B produced a clear inhibitory effect against Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis and Staphylococcus aureus. These compounds did not affect the growth of test lactic acid-producing bacteria (Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bif. breve, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lact. casei) and Escherichia coli, whereas weak growth inhibition towards Bif. bifidum was observed. At 0.5 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides A and B exhibited moderate growth inhibition towards Cl. perfringens but weak growth inhibition towards Bact. fragilis and Staph. aureus. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibitory action of seco-tanapartholides A and B towards specific bacteria without any adverse effects on lactic acid-producing bacteria may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of A. princeps var. orientalis whole plant. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These naturally occurring Artemisia whole plant-derived materials could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria such as clostridia.
TI  - Live probiotics protect intestinal epithelial cells from the effects of infection with enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC).
AB  - BACKGROUND: The colonic epithelium maintains a life long reciprocally beneficial  interaction with the colonic microbiota. Disruption is associated with mucosal injury. AIMS: We hypothesised that probiotics may limit epithelial damage induced by enteroinvasive pathogens, and promote restitution. METHODS: Human intestinal epithelial cell lines (HT29/cl.19A and Caco-2) were exposed to enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC 029:NM), and/or probiotics (Streptococcus thermophilus (ST), ATCC19258, and Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA), ATCC4356). Infected cells and controls were assessed for transepithelial resistance, chloride secretory responses, alterations in cytoskeletal and tight junctional proteins, and responses to epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation. RESULTS: Exposure of cell monolayers to live ST/LA, but not to heat inactivated ST/LA, significantly limited adhesion, invasion, and physiological dysfunction induced by EIEC. Antibiotic killed ST/LA reduced adhesion somewhat but were less effective in limiting the consequences of EIEC invasion of cell monolayers. Furthermore, live ST/LA alone increased transepithelial resistance, contrasting markedly with the fall in resistance evoked by EIEC infection, which could also be blocked by live ST/LA. The effect of ST/LA on resistance was accompanied by maintenance (actin, ZO-1) or enhancement (actinin, occludin) of cytoskeletal and tight junctional protein phosphorylation. ST/LA had no effect on chloride secretion by themselves but reversed the increase in basal secretion evoked by EIEC. EIEC also reduced the ability of EGF to activate its receptor, which was reversed by ST/LA. CONCLUSIONS: Live ST/LA interact with intestinal epithelial cells to protect them from the deleterious effect of EIEC via mechanisms that include, but are not limited to, interference with pathogen adhesion and invasion. Probiotics likely also enhance the barrier function of naive epithelial cells not exposed to any pathogen.
TI  - Chromosomal location of the genetic determinants for bacteriocins produced by Lactobacillus gasseri K7.
AB  - The production of similar or even identical bacteriocins by different lactic acid bacteria is not a rare event. To take advantage of this finding, genetic determinants of the Lactobacillus K7 bacteriocins were tested for putative homologies with previously described bacteriocins of the Lactobacillus acidophilus group through polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Among specific primer pairs of seven known bacteriocins, derived from their respective sequences, only acidocin LF221 A and B primers amplified fragments in chromosomal DNA of K7 strain that revealed strong similarity over small regions of LF221 bacteriocins. Treatment of Lactobacillus K7 with ethidium bromide and mitomycin C was ineffective in generating non-bacteriocinogenic derivatives and had no impact on plasmid loss either. Classification studies elucidated Lactobacillus K7 as a member of the Lactobacillus gasseri species.
TI  - Influence of the oral administration of lactic acid bacteria on iga producing cells associated to bronchus.
AB  - Intestinal, respiratory and genitourinary mucosal surfaces are the most important routes of entry for microbial pathogens. The stimulus of the mucosal immunity is not easy because the trigger keys for the activation do not follow the ones of the systemic immune response. In previous works we have demonstrated that some Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB), when orally administered, can induce an enhance of the gut immune response. Taking into account the concept of a common mucosal response, we studied the effect of orally administered mice with Lactobacillus casei, L. acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis on the IgA secreting cells associated to bronchus. As shown before, oral immunostimulation with LAB induced an increase of the IgA* cells at intestinal level by a dose depending effect. In this study it is also showed that the LAB assayed, with exception of L. acidophilus, were able to enhance IgA+ cells at bronchial level, being also this effect dose dependent. The increment induced by some LAB in the number of IgA+ cells on the mucosa surface of the lower respiratory tract may be very important to prevent bronchus diseases.
TI  - Prevention and treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis using exogenous Lactobacillus.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review literature examining exogenous Lactobacillus therapy for vulvovaginal candidiasis and to discuss recommendations for clinical practice and future research. DATA SOURCES: Computerized searches on MEDLINE and CINAHL November 2000, September 2001, and March 2002, with search terms including Lactobacillus, acidophilus, Candida, and yeast infections. STUDY SELECTION: Relevant English-language articles from the past 10 years. Unique or seminal studies included where pertinent. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data organized under the following headings: endogenous Lactobacillus, exogenous Lactobacillus, Candida, studies of intravaginal Lactobacillus therapy for vulvovaginal candidiasis, studies of oral Lactobacillus therapy for vulvovaginal candidiasis. CONCLUSIONS: Vaginally administered or orally ingested Lactobacillus is able to colonize the vaginal ecosystem. Controlled intervention studies regarding the effect of such colonization on vulvovaginal candidiasis are promising but few. These studies had small numbers of participants, were inconsistent in the form of Lactobacillus used, and reported conflicting results. Further randomized controlled trials involving large numbers of women are imperative. In the meantime, health care providers should discuss potential benefits with affected patients while clarifying the current lack of conclusive evidence. Without further research into currently available sources and brands of Lactobacillus and without governmental regulation of supplements and their contents, however, it is difficult to make recommendations regarding appropriate product choice.
TI  - Initial investigations into the ultrasonic lysis of microbial cells for the release of adenosine triphosphate.
AB  
TI  - Adhesion and aggregation ability of probiotic strain Lactobacillus acidophilus M92.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate aggregation and adhesiveness of Lactobacillus acidophilus M92 to porcine ileal epithelial cells in vitro, and the influence of cell surface proteins on autoaggregation and adhesiveness of this strain. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lactobacillus acidophilus M92 exhibits a strong autoaggregating phenotype and manifests a high degree of hydrophobicity determined by microbial adhesion to xylene. Aggregation and hydrophobicity were abolished upon exposure of the cells to pronase and pepsin. Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of cell surface proteins revealed the presence of potential surface layer (S-layer) proteins, approximated at 45 kDa, in L. acidophilus M92. The relationship between autoaggregation and adhesiveness to intestinal tissue was investigated by observing the adhesiveness of L. acidophilus M92 to porcine ileal epithelial cells. Removal of the S-layer proteins by extraction with 5 mol l-1 LiCl reduced autoaggregation and in vitro adhesion of this strain. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that there is relationship between autoaggregation and adhesiveness ability of L. acidophilus M92, mediated by proteinaceous components on the cell surface. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This investigation has shown that L. acidophilus M92 has the ability to establish in the human gastrointestinal tract, which is an important determinant in the choice of probiotic strains.
TI  - Three new insertion sequence elements ISLdl2, ISLdl3, and ISLdl4 in Lactobacillus delbrueckii: isolation, molecular characterization, and potential use for strain identification.
AB  - A group of new insertion sequence (IS) elements, ISLdl2, ISLdl3, and ISLdl4, from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis ATCC 15808 was isolated, characterized, and used for strain identification together with ISLdl1, recently characterized as an L. delbrueckii IS element belonging to the ISL3 family. ISLdl2 was 1367 bp in size and had a 24 bp IR and an 8 bp DR. The single ORF of ISLdl2 encoded a protein of 392 aa similar to transposases of the IS256 family. ISLdl3 had a single ORF encoding a protein of 343 aa similar to transposases of the IS30 family. Finally, ISLdl4 had a single ORF encoding a protein of 406 aa and displayed homology to the transposases of the IS110 family. ISLdl4 was only slight different from ISL4 (Accession No. AY040213). ISLdl1, ISLdl2, and ISLdl4 were present in all of the 10 L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis and subsp. delbrueckii strains tested, as well as in three of the 11 L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strains tested. ISLdl3 was present only in four closely related strains of L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis. These IS elements were not observed in Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, or Lactobacillus plantarum. A cluster of IS elements, ISLdl1, ISLdl2, ISLdl3, ISLdl4, and ISL6, was observed in L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis strain ATCC 15808. Within this cluster, ISLdl4 was inserted into ISLdl1 between the left IR and the start codon of ORF455, encoding a putative transposase. Most of the integration sites of the IS elements were strain-specific. We have observed that IS elements can migrate from one strain to another as integral parts of bacterial DNA by using phage LL-H as a vehicle. We demonstrate for the first time that inverse PCR and vectorette PCR methods with primers based on sequences of the IS elements could be used for identification of L. delbrueckii strains.
TI  - Prevalence of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and performance by beef feedlot cattle given Lactobacillus direct-fed microbials.
AB  - Fecal shedding of Escherichia coli O157:H7, the prevalence of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in pens and on carcasses and hides, and cattle performance as a result of daily dietary supplementation with Lactobacillus-based direct-fed microbials (DFMs) were evaluated in a feeding trial involving 180 beef steers. Steers were evaluated for shedding of E. coli O157:H7 by an immunomagnetic separation technique on arrival at the feedlot, just before treatment with the DFMs, and every 14 days thereafter until slaughter. Composite pen fecal samples were collected every 14 days (alternating weeks with animal testing), and prevalence on hides and carcasses at slaughter was also evaluated. Feedlot performance (body weight gain and feed intake) was measured for the period during which the DFMs were fed. Gain efficiency was calculated as the ratio of weight gain to feed intake. Lactobacillus acidophilus NPC 747 decreased (P < 0.01) the shedding of E. coli O157:H7 in the feces of individual cattle during the feeding period. E. coli O157:H7 was approximately twice as likely to be detected in control animal samples as in samples from animals receiving L. acidophilus NPC 747. In addition, DFM supplementation decreased (P < 0.05) the number of E. coli O157:H7-positive hide samples at harvest and the number of pens testing positive for the pathogen. Body weight gains (on a live or carcass basis) and feed intakes during the DFM supplementation period did not differ among treatments. Gain efficiencies on a live-weight basis did not differ among treatments, but carcass-based gain/feed ratios tended (P < 0.06) to be better for animals receiving the two DFM treatments than for control animals. The results of this study suggest that the feeding of a Lactobacillus-based DFM to cattle will decrease, but not eliminate, fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7, as well as contamination on hides, without detrimental effects on performance.
TI  - Inhibition of nonproteolytic Clostridium botulinum with lactic acid bacteria and  their bacteriocins at refrigeration temperatures.
AB  - Nonproteolytic Clostridium botulinum (strains 17B, Beluga, and 202F) was found to be inhibited by Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Streptococcus, and Pediococcus species in tests by the spot-on-the-lawn simultaneous-antagonism method at 10, 15, and 25 degrees C. C. botulinum 17B was the most resistant strain. Inhibition zone size increased with decreasing incubation temperature. Six strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus and seven strains of bifidobacteria failed to produce an inhibition zone on buffered reinforced clostridium Prussian blue agar seeded with spores of any of the selected C. botulinum strains. C. botulinum 17B was sensitive to 50 to 100 IU of nisin per ml and to 10 to 20 AU of pediocin A per ml.
TI  - Optimization of a formulation containing viable lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - In the present study, gastric juice resistant tablet formulations of lactic acid  bacteria (LAB) were developed, using hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS) as well as alginates, apple pectin and Metolose as matrix forming components. To optimize the formulation-using survival rate in acid medium, and disintegration time in intestinal fluid as test parameters-tablets were modified with respect to LAB content, amount of applied excipients per tablet, and compaction forces. A decrease of viable cells of not more than one log unit after 2h of incubation in acid medium was desired, as well as a disintegration time of 1h in phosphate buffer pH 6.8. It was found that the amount of HPMCAS in the tablet correlates with gastric juice resistance. As HPMCAS also leads to a decrease of disintegration time in intestinal fluid, slight amounts of this excipient were preferred. The best protective qualities against artificial gastric juice were observed when tablets were prepared from compaction mixtures of LAB, HPMCAS and sodium alginate.
TI  - Impact of two probiotic Lactobacillus strains feeding on fecal lactobacilli and weight gains in chicken.
AB  - Two probiotic strains, Lactobacillus agilis JCM 1048 and L. salivarius subsp. salicinius JCM 1230 isolated from chicken intestine, exhibited probiotic characteristics that can be applied for chicken production. After 7 days of probiotic feeding (FD7), the count of intestinal lactobacilli in the probiotic group (group P, n=10) was significantly (p<0.05) higher than that in the control group (group C, n=9). After 40 days of probiotic feeding (FD40), the lactobacilli and enterococci counts were stable but the Enterobacteriaceae number was significantly reduced (p<0.05). A total of 163 isolated lactobacilli were identified as the L. acidophilus/gallinarum group (49.7%), L. agilis (30.7%), L. salivarius (9.2%), L. reuteri (9.2%), and Lactobacillus spp. (1.2%). The probiotic lactobacilli positively affected the Lactobacillus biota in chickens at FD7, with a significant increase in the number (p<0.05) of L. agilis and group P. The viable counts of each Lactobacillus species at FD40, however, showed no differences between two groups. An increasing incidence of L. agilis was also noted with probiotic feeding. The probiotic effect of two strains resulted in significantly increased weight gains (10.7%) of group P in comparison with group C at FD40 (p<0.01).
TI  - Biphasic kinetics of growth and bacteriocin production with Lactobacillus amylovorus DCE 471 occur under stress conditions.
AB  - Micro-organisms used during the production of fermented foods are subjected to several abiotic stresses. Microbial survival during these processes strongly depends on the ability of the cells to adapt and become more tolerant to the environmental conditions. Cultivation of Lactobacillus amylovorus DCE 471, a potential strain for use during type II sourdough fermentations, at low temperatures, unfavourable pH and high salt concentrations resulted in biphasic growth patterns. In addition, two separate bacteriocin peaks, as well as a dramatic change in cellular morphology, were observed. In general, an increase of the specific bacteriocin production occurred during the second growth phase. Finally, the observed sugar consumption profiles were affected by the applied fermentation temperature. Moreover, the highest bacteriocin activity occurred during maltose consumption at a low constant temperature of 28 degrees C and a constant pH of 5.4. Plate counts from both growth phases revealed the existence of two colony types. Irregular colonies were found to outnumber smoother colonies during the first growth phase, while the second growth phase was characterized by a greater number of smooth colonies. Electron microscopy was used to investigate the observed morphological switch at the single-cell level. Single, rod-shaped cells changed into elongated cells that grew in chains. Colony and cell morphology changes coincided with the biphasic growth pattern.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of self-etching primer-bonding systems.
AB  - Self-etching primers are now considered the new generation of dentin bonding systems that modify and incorporate the bacteria-containing smear layer into their bonding mechanism. The antibacterial effects of the self-etching primers Clearfil SE Bond, Mac Bond, Imperva FL Bond, One-Up BondF and Prompt L-Pop were evaluated using the bacteria Streptococcus mutans ATCC25175, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus catenaforme, Lactobacillus jensenii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Clostridium ramosum, Prevotella oris, Prevotella denticola and Fusobacterium nucleatum, with a disk diffusion method. A single-bottle total-etch dentin adhesive (Excite) was used for comparisons and chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as the positive control. After incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed. One-Up BondF, Prompt L-Pop and Excite showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. The bonding agents of Clearfil SE Bond, Mac Bond and Imperva FL Bond were unable to inhibit the growth of Lactobacillus jensenii and Actinomyces odontolyticus, while the primers of these systems produced inhibition halos to all tested microorganisms greater than that of chlorhexidine.
TI  - [Submental abscess by Lactobacillus acidophilus/jensenii].
AB  - The different species of Lactobacillus genus are bacteria of a low pathogenicity. They are found in the gastrointestinal tract, the female genitourinary tract, and also as part of the anaerobic flora in the mouth. Due to this low pathogenicity, they are generally related with infections together with other with more virulent microorganisms, or in immunocompromised patients. In our case, Lactobacillus appears alone as an etiological agent in an immunocompetent patient with a submental abscess.
TI  - Intestinal pathway of internalisation of lactic acid bacteria and gut mucosal immunostimulation.
AB  - The induction of the gut mucosal immune response is dependent on the antigen interacting with the M cells of Peyer's patches and with the immune cells associated with this lymphoid organ. In previous studies we showed that the mucosal immunostimulation by LAB varied depending upon the strain being studied. Some of them increased the inflammatory immune response and others enhanced the level of secretory antibody (S-IgA). Our aim was to determine the pathway of the internalisation of LAB strains in the intestine, to provide a basis for understing the different behaviour exhibited by them. The presence of LAB on Peyer's patches or in the immune cells associated with the villi of small intestine was determined using fluorescein-labelled bacteria and by transmission electron microscopy. Mice were dosed orally by intubation, with 10<sup>1</sup> cells of labelled single strains of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. For electron microscopy studies unlabelled bacteria were used. Histological preparations of the small and large intestine were performed 1 hour after administration of the bacteria. Fluorescent bacteria of L. casei and S. thermophilus were found only in Peyer's patches while L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and L. acidophilus were observed in Peyer's patches and in the small intestine. L. acidophilus was also found in the large intestine. We confirmed these findings by electron microscopy. We determined that for L. casei the pathway of internalisation was via the M and FAE cells of Peyer's patches, while for S. thermophilus, L. acidophilus and L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus the interaction with the immune cells of Peyer's patches was through the follicle associated epithelium (FAE). L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and L. acidophilus also interacted with the epithelial cells of the small intestine and L. acidophilus with epithelial cells of the large intestine. These results suggest that the different effects of LAB on the mucosal immunostimulation, are related to the different pathways of gut internalisation used to take contact with the immune cells associated with the lamina propria intestinal.
TI  - Inhibitory effects on selected oral bacteria of antibacterial agents incorporated in a glass ionomer cement.
AB  - The objectives of the study were to investigate the antimicrobial efficacy, over  time, of combining antibacterial agents with a glass ionomer cement (GIC). This was assessed using an agar diffusion test. Chlorhexidine hydrochloride, cetylpyridinium chloride, cetrimide and benzalkonium chloride were added to Fuji IX GIC at 0, 1, 2 and 4% w/w. Antibacterial-GIC specimens were placed onto agar plates inoculated with one of six bacterial species (Streptococcis, Lactobacillus, and Actinomyces, two each) and the area of inhibition calculated after 24 h incubation. The experiment was repeated weekly and at week 11 the surface of the specimen was abraded prior to replacing on inoculated agar plates. Control specimens of the GIC produced no bacterial inhibition. The antibacterial-GIC combination specimens showed significant inhibition which decreased at different rates over the test period. Resurfacing of the specimens showed a dramatic increase of antibacterial action similar to levels produced on week 1. CT-GIC showed the greatest (p < 0.005) inhibitory effect throughout the experimental period for 4 out of 6 test bacteria. The addition of antibacterial agents to Fuji IX creates a GIC material with significant antimicrobial action in vitro which is dependent on concentration and type of antibacterial agent, and appears to be associated primarily with a release of the antibacterial from the surface layer of the specimen.
TI  - Growth inhibition of intestinal bacteria and mutagenicity of 2-, 3-, 4-aminobiphenyls, benzidine, and biphenyl.
AB  - 2-Aminobiphenyl (2-ABP), 3-aminobiphenyl (3-ABP) and 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP), but not benzidine (Bz) and biphenyl (Bp), were found to be inhibitory to the growth of human intestinal bacteria Bifidobacterium infantis ATCC 15697, B. bifidium ATCC 11863, Clostridium perfringens ATCC 13124, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, E. coli ATCC 35218, Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 13047 and Salmonella typhimurium TA98, TA100, YG1041 at 10-200 microg/ml in culture broth. Bacteroides distasonis ATCC 8503, B. fragilis ATCC 25285, B. theataiotaomicron ATCC 29741, C. paraputrificum ATCC 26780, C. clostridiiforme ATCC 25537, Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 and Enterococcus faecium ATCC 19434 were not inhibited by the above mentioned compounds in concentrations up to 200 microg/ml. The Ames Salmonella/microsome assay was employed to test the mutagenicity of the above-mentioned compounds using strains TA98 and TA100 in the presence and absence of Aroclor 1254-induced rat S9 mix. It was found that 4-ABP was mutagenic to both TA98 and TA100, and Bz was mutagenic to TA98 in the presence of rat S9 mix. 2-Aminobiphenyl, 3-ABP, and Bp were not mutagenic to both strains tested. 2-Aminobiphenyl and 3-ABP are chemical isomers of 4-ABP and are as strong as 4-ABP in inhibiting the growth of intestinal bacteria but not as mutagenic as 4-ABP. Evidence suggested that the mechanism of growth inhibition is not involved with the interaction of DNA that causes mutations, but rather on the electron transport system of these organisms.
TI  - An in vitro model for investigating intestinal adhesion of potential dairy propionibacteria probiotic strains using cell line C2BBe1.
AB  - AIMS: The purposes of this study were to screen the adhesion properties of dairy  propionibacteria strains and evaluate whether C2BBe1 could be used in the screening of potential probiotic strains. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirteen dairy propionibacteria strains and two control strains, Lactobacillus acidophilus MJLA1 and Bifidobacterium lactis BDBB2, were tested for adhesion to C2BBe1. Electron microscopic observations demonstrated that the control strains, L. acidophilus MJLA1 and B. lactis BDBB2, had similar adhesive ability to C2BBe1 as had been previously shown to Caco-2. Only one of the 13 strains of dairy propionibacteria, strain P. jensenii 702, demonstrated adhesion to C2BBe1. CONCLUSIONS: C2BBe1 can provide an alternative to Caco-2 for assessing in vitro adhesion properties of probiotic strains. Adhesion properties of dairy propionibacteria were strain-dependent. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: C2BBe1 is highly suitable for application in bacterial adhesion studies, and was used successfully to select a new potential probiotic.
TI  - Interactions of lactic acid bacteria with human intestinal epithelial cells: effects on cytokine production.
AB  - As a participant in the mucosal immune response, the intestinal epithelial cell must respond to a variety of stimuli, including lactic acid bacteria (LAB) consumed in the diet. The objective of this study was to compare the abilities of several strains of LAB to modulate cytokine secretion by human intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) line HT-29. Certain strains of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, and Lactobacillus acidophilus suppressed the production of the chemokine RANTES by stimulated HT-29 IEC, although the magnitude of this suppression varied depending on the nature of the bacterial growth medium. Similarly, specific strains showed growth condition-dependent suppression of HT-29 interleukin-8 (IL-8) production. Strain-dependent effects were also seen for the suppression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) production. The binding of several of these bacterial strains to the HT-29 cell line was also examined. Different strains were found to have differing abilities to interact with IEC, with L. rhamnosus R0011 being the strain that generally had the most extensive effects on HT-29 cytokine production and also bound to HT-29 IEC most effectively. Modulation of IEC cytokine production has the potential to profoundly affect the mucosal microenvironment, influencing the immune response to pathogens and other ingested antigens.
TI  - Prophylactic feeding of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM to mice attenuates overt colonic hyperplasia.
AB  - The objective of this project was to determine if the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM would protect mice from developing transmissible murine colonic hyperplasia (TMCH) caused by Citrobacter rodentium. Our hypothesis was that the oral administration of L. acidophilus NCFM to mice would mitigate colonic hyperplasia and modulate the host immune response. A concurrent administration (CA) study was performed by feeding mice phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), C. rodentium only, L. acidophilus NCFM only, or C. rodentium and NCFM concurrently on the same day. The mice in the CA study were not protected by the probiotic, since their mean colon sample weights (0.109 g) were significantly higher than those of the PBS controls (0.0774 g), and the hematoxylin and eosin-stained samples showed histological changes typically associated with TMCH. A prophylactic feeding (PF) study was performed by orally feeding mice PBS or NCFM once daily for 20 consecutive days; in addition, on day 7, mice were challenged with either PBS or C. rodentium. Mice in the PF study were protected when they consumed the probiotic prior to the pathogen challenge, since their mean colon sample weights (0.0812 g) were not significantly higher than those of the controls (0.0753 g). The hematoxylin and eosin-stained samples appeared similar to the control samples, and the intestinal interleukin (IL)-15 and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) mRNA levels were reduced. L. acidophilus NCFM did attenuate overt colonic hyperplasia when fed to mice prior to challenge with C. rodentium. The mouse model used in this study enabled us to investigate the efficacy of the L. acidophilus NCFM in preventing gastrointestinal disease and is a valid model for future probiotic research.
TI  - Isolation, selection, and characterization of lactic acid bacteria for a competitive exclusion product to reduce shedding of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in cattle.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were selected on the basis of characteristics indicating that they would be good candidates for a competitive exclusion product (CEP) that would inhibit Escherichia coli O157:H7 in the intestinal tract of live cattle. Fecal samples from cattle that were culture negative for E. coli O157:H7 were collected. LAB were isolated from cattle feces by repeated plating on deMan Rogosa Sharpe agar and lactobacillus selection agar. Six hundred eighty-six pure colonies were isolated, and an agar spot test was used to test each isolate for its inhibition of a four-strain mixture of E. coli O157:H7. Three hundred fifty-five isolates (52%) showed significant inhibition. Seventy-five isolates showing maximum inhibition were screened for acid and bile tolerance. Most isolates were tolerant of acid at pH levels of 2, 4, 5, and 7 and at bile levels of 0.05, 0.15, and 0.3% (oxgall) and were subsequently identified with the API system. Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus delbreukii, Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus cellobiosus, Leuconostoc spp., and Pediococcus acidilactici were the most commonly identified LAB. Nineteen strains were further tested for antibiotic resistance and inhibition of E. coli O157:H7 in manure and rumen fluid. Four of these 19 strains showed susceptibility to all of the antibiotics, 13 significantly reduced E. coli counts in manure, and 15 significantly reduced E. coli counts in rumen fluid (P < 0.05) during at least one of the sampling periods. One of the strains, M35, was selected as the best candidate for a CEP. A 16S rRNA sequence analysis of M35 revealed its close homology to Lactobacillus crispatus. The CEP developed will be used in cattle-feeding trials.
TI  - The bactericidal effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus, garcinol and Protykin compared to clarithromycin, on Helicobacter pylori.
AB  - Chronic infection with Helicobacter pylori causes peptic ulcers, gastric cancer and lymphoma. We evaluated the inhibitory effects of the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus DDS-1J, the antibiotic clarithromycin and the natural antioxidants garcinol and Protykin (containing 50% trans-resveratrol) on Helicobacter pylori strain ATCC 49503. The findings of this study indicate that Lactobacillus acidophilus DDS-1J exerts a growth inhibitory effect on H. pylori at a ratio of 1:1 or higher in vitro. In the case of clarithromycin, garcinol and resveratrol, the bactericidal effect is time and concentration dependent. Clarithromycin completely inhibited growth at > or = 62.5 microg/ml at 6 h and at > or = 31.5 microg/ml at 12 h. For garcinol the highest concentration needed for complete inhibition was 31.5 microg/ml at 6 h and 3.9 microg/ml after 12 h incubation. For resveratrol, significant inhibition was noted at 1000 microg/ml at 12 h only. The bactericidal effect of garcinol was reduced by the addition of resveratrol at all concentrations < or = 125 microg/ml at 6 and 12 h. We conclude from this study that Lactobacillus acidophilus DDS-1J inhibits H. pylori at 1:1 and higher ratios. Also, between the two antioxidants, garcinol is much more potent than resveratrol as a bactericidal agent against H. pylori, and that resveratrol may antagonize this effect. Finally, our study showed equivalent or better bactericidal activity of garcinol compared to clarithromycin against H. pylori at 6 and 12 h incubation, indicating a potential role for this antioxidant in treatment for H. pylori infection.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of a hydraulic calcium phosphate cement for dental applications.
AB  - Calcium hydroxide is currently used in dentistry for endodontic treatment where its main advantage consists of its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory potency. However, it also has some drawbacks such as pulp necrosis, slight solubility, slow and low hardening, and retraction on drying. Since the studies conducted by Brown and Chow (IADR 1983, abst. 207), calcium phosphate-based cements (CPC) have attracted considerable interest in bone reconstruction because of their good osteoconductivity. By mixing calcium bis-dihydrogenphosphate monohydrate (MCPM) and calcium oxide with sodium phosphate buffer in the form of liquid phase, we obtained a CPC with better mechanical properties than calcium hydroxide. The setting reaction produced a mixture of calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite and calcium hydroxide, making this cement more suitable for dental applications than orthopedic ones. The presence of calcium hydroxide a priori confers antibacterial properties to this cement, which were investigated in agar plates (diffusion method) against Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Candida albicans (clinical isolates) and a preparation of polymicrobial flora isolated from dental plaque. The cement samples tested were prepared at calcium-to-phosphate molar ratios (Ca/P) ranging from 1.67 to 2.75. A pure calcium hydroxide paste was used as reference material. Clear and reproducible bacterial growth inhibition was observed for cement samples with Ca/P > or = 2 against all the microorganisms tested. MCPM-CaO-based cement is therefore a potential candidate for pulp capping and cavity lining.
TI  - Probiotic properties of human lactobacilli strains to be used in the gastrointestinal tract.
AB  - AIMS: The study of two human strains of Lactobacillus to be used as probiotics in the gastrointestinal tract. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Lactobacillus acidophilus UO 001 and Lact. gasseri UO 002, were resistant to the gastrointestinal conditions (pH 2 and 3, presence of pepsin, pancreatin or bile salts), the resistance was enhanced in the presence of skimmed milk. Additionally, adhered to Caco-2 cells through glycoproteins in Lact. gasseri and carbohydrates in the case of Lact. acidophilus. These strains are able to inhibit the growth of certain enteropathogens: Salmonella, Listeria and Campylobacter without interfering with the normal microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract, as stated by using the mixed culture and the spot agar test. Finally, strongly adherent Lact. gasseri were found to inhibit the attachment of Escherichia coli O111 to intestinal Caco-2 cells under the condition of exclusion. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the two strains of Lactobacillus from human origin present important properties for survival in, and colonization of, the gastrointestinal tract, that give them potential probiotic. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Two strains of Lactobacillus isolated from human vagina of healthy premenopausal women could be promising candidates to be used in the preparation of probiotic products and for their use as health-promoting bacteria.
TI  - Identification of randomly selected colonies of lactobacilli from normal vaginal  fluid by pyrosequencing of the 16S rDNA variable V1 and V3 regions.
AB  - The present study aimed to characterize lactobacilli in vaginal fluid from 23 adult healthy women by using high-throughput DNA sequencing for identification of a large number of randomly selected colonies appearing on Rogosa and blood agar. The typing method was based on broad-range PCR of 16S rRNA gene variable regions V1 and V3, pyrosequencing, and classification of the fragments by alignment with NCBI-catalogued sequences and type strain sequences. Four major groups of sequences were found among the 402 isolates clearly corresponding to Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus iners and Lactobacillus jensenii when compared to the sequences obtained for type strains. Our results indicate that pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments as used here is a fast and reliable method well suited for identification to the species level, even within the Lactobacillus acidophilus complex.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria isolated from dairy products inhibit genotoxic effect of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide in SOS-chromotest.
AB  - Antigenotoxic activity against 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO) of lactic acid bacteria isolated from commercial dairy products was studied using SOS-Chromotest. The supernatants from bacteria-genotoxin co-incubations in general exhibited a strong suppression on SOS-induction produced by 4-NQO on the tester organism Escherichia coli PQ37 (sfiA::lacZ). High genotoxicity inhibition (>75%) was found for 31/67 of the examined bacteria and the maximum values of some strains within the species were as follows: Lactobacillus casei, 99.1%; L. plantarum, 93.3%; L. rhamnosus, 93.4%; L. acidophilus, 90.9%; L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, 85.7% and Bifidobacterium bifidum, 89.6%; Strains with low antigenotoxicity (5-60%) were evidenced in both L. acidophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, whereas some inactive strains were found only in L. casei and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. Cell exposure to 100 degrees C for 15 min prevented antigenotoxicity and no effect was evidenced for cell-free spent media. The active strains survived at 0.1 mM 4-NQO exposure and generally presented some relevant functional properties, such as tolerance to bile (0.5%) or acid environment (pH 2.0) and adherence to Caco-2 enterocytes. Antigenotoxicity was always associated with modification of the 4-NQO absorbance profile.
TI  - [The probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus--an alternative treatment of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - The probiotics or biotherapeutical agents are microorganisms that have an antagonistic activity regarding pathogens in vivo. Therapeutic application of these microorganisms is mostly in cases of infections of non-sterile mucous surfaces--vagina and large intestines. With the help of the probiotic L. acidophilus bacterial vaginosis can be treated successfully in a natural way. The lack of systemic side effects makes it a drug of choice in the treatment of pregnant women. More studies in this direction and development of new strategies for treatment of bacterial vaginosis in pregnant and non-pregnant women are needed.
TI  - Vaginal lactobacilli: self- and co-aggregating ability.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria are the dominant bacteria of the vaginal tract in healthy women. Lactobacillus species form a barrier population that protects from pathogen colonisation by mechanisms that include adhesion to epithelial surfaces, self-aggregation and co-aggregation. In this study, factors involved in the self-aggregating ability of vaginal lactobacilli and in the co-aggregation of these microorganisms with Candida spp. are studied. Both self-aggregation and co-aggregation are monitored quantitatively by the decrease in the absorbance of suspensions of the microorganisms and qualitatively by light microscopy. The self-aggregating ability of four vaginal lactobacilli was shown to be caused by a peptide or protein sensitive to trypsin. However, in self-aggregating Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 1294 the factor was resistant to trypsin and sensitive to pepsin. Among self-aggregating lactobacilli, L. acidophilus CRL 1294 and L. salivarius CRL 1328 were able to co-aggregate with Candida spp. The co-aggregating factor for both strains proved to be peptide of the surface and a peptide on the bacterial surface, while the receptor on the yeast was a carbohydrate. Co-aggregation of both lactobacilli and Candida spp. was inhibited by the addition of mannose but was not affected by other carbohydrates. Self and co-aggregation factors were not able to induce aggregation in non-aggregating lactobacilli.
TI  - Evaluation of the effect of malt, wheat and barley extracts on the viability of potentially probiotic lactic acid bacteria under acidic conditions.
AB  - In this work, the effect of cereal extracts, used as delivery vehicles for potentially probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB), on the acid tolerance of the cells was evaluated under conditions that simulate the gastric tract. More specifically, the effect of malt, barley and wheat extracts on the viability of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus reuteri during exposure for 4 h in a phosphate buffer acidified at pH 2.5 was investigated. In the absence of cereal extracts all strains demonstrated a significant reduction in their cell population, particularly L. plantarum. The viability of L. plantarum was improved by approximately 4 log(10) cycles in the presence of malt and 3 log(10) cycles in the presence of wheat and barley. The survival of L. acidophilus and L. reuteri was increased by more than 1.5 and 0.7 log(10) cycle, respectively, upon addition of cereal extracts. In order to evaluate the contribution of the cereal constituents on cell survival, the individual effect of glucose, maltose and free amino nitrogen (FAN), which were added at concentrations that correlated to the reducing sugar and FAN content of the cereal extracts, was examined. The viability of L. plantarum was progressively improved as the maltose or glucose concentration increased; an increase by approximately 2 log(10) cycles was observed in the presence of 8.33 g/l sugar. The survival of L. acidophilus increased by more than 1 log(10) cycle, even at very low concentrations of maltose and glucose (e.g., 0.67 g/l), while L. reuteri stability was enhanced in the presence of maltose but no appreciable effect was demonstrated in the presence of glucose. Sugar analysis indicated that glycolysis was inhibited in all cases. Addition of tryptone and yeast extract, used as sources of FAN, enhanced L. acidophilus acid tolerance, but did not affect L. reuteri and L. plantarum. The results presented in this study indicate that malt, wheat and barley extracts exhibit a significant protective effect on the viability of L. plantarum, L. acidophilus and L. reuteri under acidic conditions, which could be mainly attributed to the amount of sugar present in the cereal extracts.
TI  - Interaction of lactic acid bacteria with the gut immune system.
AB  - Health claims of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) used in functional foods and pharmaceutical preparations are based on the capacity of these microorganisms to stimulate the host immune system. In this study, the antigenic effect of LAB (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus) on the gut immune system of BALB/c mice was evaluated. A dose-dependent increase of the Bcl2 protein was observed with all LAB assayed. Furthermore, the analysis of cytokine-producing cells in the lamina propria of gut showed that TNFalpha and INFgamma values, determined in macrophages cultured from Peyer patches, were enhanced for all the LAB assayed. An important increase of interleukins IL-10 and IL-4 was observed mainly in mice fed with Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus or Lactobacillus casei, while a significant induction of IL-2 and IL-12 was only observed with L. acidophilus (P<0.01). These effects were dose dependent. The role of produced cytokines in the balance Th1/Th2 was determined by a systemic antibody response against parenterally injected ovoalbumin. L. casei, L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and L. acidophilus enhanced the IgG1 response favouring Th2 balance, while L. acidophilus also increased the IgG2a response inducing Th1 balance. S. thermophilus did not influence the balance Th1/Th2. Our studies showed that lactic acid bacteria induce distinct mucosal cytokine profiles showing different adjuvant capacity among them. Thus, selection of probiotic strain with immunological properties must be well defined to influence cytokine expression that favour the claimed immune response.
TI  - [Isolation and identification of the broad spectrum antimicrobial peptide AP311 produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus].
AB  - The heat stable antimicrobial peptide (AP311) produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus was isolated and identified. The AP311 has broad spectrum of inhibition including many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The inhibition activity of AP311 was lost upon treatment with trypsin, subtilisin, proteanase K, chymotrypsin and pepsin. Inhibition activity of AP311 was decreased with pH increasing. The AP311 is very stable at acidic condition (pH2-4) even if heating at 100 degrees C for 30 min. But it was inactivated at basic pH (pH12) and the activity was restored completely upon reversion to acidic. The AP311 was not precipitated and inactivated by various organic solvents, except n-butanol. When the precipitate was redissolved in 0.02 mol/L HC1, its activity was restored. Based on its proteinaceous nature, broad spectrum of inhibition, we propose that AP311 should be considered the broad spectrum antimicrobial peptide.
TI  - Ingested probiotics reduce nasal colonization with pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-hemolytic streptococci).
AB  - BACKGROUND: As a bacterial reservoir, the nose may harbor potentially pathogenic  bacteria (PPB: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and Haemophilus influenzae). In patients carrying PPB, antiseptic regimens could be crucial for infection control after major operations on or injuries of the head, nasal sinuses, or lungs. Such regimens may also be important for diabetic patients and persons receiving hemodialysis, in intensive care units, or with impaired immunity due to various other causes. OBJECTIVE: We tested a possible effect of the ingestion of probiotics on the bacterial flora of the nose. DESIGN: In an open, prospective trial, 209 volunteers were randomly assigned to consume either a probiotic, fermented milk drink [65 mL with Lactobacillus GG (ATCC 53103), Bifidobacterium sp B420, Lactobacillus acidophilus 145, and Streptococcus thermophilus; n = 108] or standard yogurt (180 g; n = 101) daily for 3 wk. Nasal microbial flora were analyzed on days 1, 21, and 28. The microbial examination was blinded to the source of the samples. RESULTS: We found a significant reduction (19%; P < 0.001) in the occurrence of nasal PPB in the group who consumed the probiotic drink but not in the group who consumed yogurt. The effect was mainly on gram-positive bacteria, which decreased significantly (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that regular intake of probiotics can reduce PPB in the upper respiratory tract. The results also indicate a linkage of the lymphoid tissue between the gut and the upper respiratory tract.
TI  - [Effects of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) on growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine effects of para-aminobenzoic acid  (PABA) on the growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus). METHODS: Different concentrations of PABA (10(-10)-10(-3) g/L) were separately transferred to the modified Carlsson medium. L. acidophilus (ATCC4356) grew in these Carlsson media. All cultures were incubated at 37 degrees C anaerobically in atmosphere of 80% of nitrogen, 10% of hydrogen, and 10% of carbon dioxide for 48 hours. Absorbance values (lambda = 540 nm) of bacterial suspensions were measured using a spectrometer (UV-1601). Colony forming units (CFU) were obtained by growing L. acidophilus in Carlsson media with different concentration of PABA (10(-10)-10(-3) g/L). RESULTS: Different concentrations of PABA (10(-10)-10(-4) g/L) had different stimulating effects on the growth of L. acidophilus (P < 0.05). But stimulating effects declined, when PABA concentration was 10(-5) g/L, and when the concentration of PABA reached 10(-3) g/L, the stimulating effect disappeared. CONCLUSION: This study indicates PABA stimulates the growth of L. acidophilus, and PABA can promote growth of L. acidophilus.
TI  - Development of surrogate markers for oral immunisation against Candida albicans.
AB  - We have developed an oral vaccine using the blastococcoid form of Candida albicans with a murine model of oral candidiasis with infection-resistant (BALB/c) and infection-prone (DBA/2) mice. Previous studies had demonstrated that enhanced clearance was linked to increased production of both Th1 and Th2 cytokines (IFN-gamma and IL-4, respectively) in regional lymph nodes, and increased secretion of IFN-gamma and NO in saliva. Subsequent study using oral Lactobacillus acidophilus (LAVRI-A1) induced a local cytokine pattern and enhanced clearance of intra-oral C. albicans similar to that noted in animals given killed candida vaccine. Thus, the experiment was repeated with a 2 month gap between completion of a vaccine course and challenge with live C. albicans. Compared to control mice, those given the oral vaccine had a 4 log reduction in colonisation on day 2, associated with twice the levels of secretion of IFN-gamma and IL-4 from the regional node cells, five times the level of nitric oxide in saliva, and suppression of NO production with MMLA induced a 2 log increase in oral colonisation. Thus while both IFN-gamma and IL-4 appear to contribute to clearance of oral C. albicans, IL-4 appears to act through a paracrine enhancement of NO production. Studies in man are in progress to define similar surrogate markers of immune protection, prior to oral vaccine trial.
TI  - [Antibiotic properties of Lactobacillus acidophilus, "Narine" strain, and the ways for their improvement].
AB  - L. acidophilus strain 317/402 "Narine" shows high antimicrobial activity with respect to pathogenic microorganisms. The degree of the activity of lactobacilli depends on cultivation conditions and the composition of the culture medium and its acidity, age of the culture, conditions of technological process, etc. The antimicrobial inhibition concentration of the product "Narine", ensuring in vitro activity against Yersinia enterocolitica, Y. pseudotuberculosis, Vibrio NAG, etc., has been established.
TI  - Assessment of safety of lactobacillus strains based on resistance to host innate  defense mechanisms.
AB  - Seven Lactobacillus strains belonging to four species were evaluated for pathogenicity as well as for in vitro sensitivity to the bactericidal mechanisms of macrophages in a rabbit infective endocarditis (IE) model. Two bacteremia-associated strains, L. rhamnosus PHLS A103/70 and L. casei PHLS A357/84, as well as the L. rhamnosus type strain and the probiotic L. rhamnosus strain ATCC 53103, showed moderate infectivity, and the virulence of the probiotic L. casei strain Shirota and type strains such as L. acidophilus ATCC 4356(T) and L. gasseri DSM 20243(T) in the model was negligible. The strains that showed pathogenic potential in the rabbit IE model (PHLS A357/84, PHLS A103/70, and ATCC 53103) were more resistant than strain Shirota to intracellular killing activity by mouse macrophages in vitro and also to bactericidal nitrogen intermediates, such as nitric oxide and NO(2)(-) ions. These results suggest that resistance to host innate defense systems, which would function at inflammatory lesions, should be considered in the safety assessment of Lactobacillus strains.
TI  - Role of internalization in the pathogenicity of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli infection in a gnotobiotic murine model.
AB  - We investigated the role of bacterial internalization in the killing caused by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infection using a gnotobiotic murine model. A high number of internalized STEC was found in the colonic epithelial cells of STEC-infected mice by both an ex vivo assay and transmission electron microscopy. Most of these mice were killed within 10 days after infection. However, the implantation of lactic acid bacteria in such mice before infection markedly decreased the number of internalized STECs and also completely protected these hosts from killing by a STEC infection. The inhibition of such internalization by immunoglobulin also prevented the hosts from being killed. The Shiga toxin levels in these hosts indicated an inhibition of the penetration of Shiga toxins produced in the colon to the underlying tissue. These results suggested that the internalization plays an important role in the pathogenicity caused by STEC infection in a gnotobiotic murine model.
TI  - Cholesterol removal from media by lactococci.
AB  - Elevated serum cholesterol in humans is generally a risk factor correlated with the development of coronary heart disease. It has been reported that a culture of Lactobacillus acidophilus actively taking up cholesterol from a laboratory medium would function in vivo to exert a hypocholesterolemic effect. In the present study, seven strains of the genus Lactococcus were examined for their ability to remove cholesterol from laboratory media during growth. All strains of lactococci tested could remove cholesterol from media without degrading cholesterol. The amount of cholesterol removed was strain specific. Among them, Lc. Lactis subsp. lactis biovar diacetylactis N7 could remove as much cholesterol as L. acidophilus ATCC 43121, which had a beneficial influence on serum cholesterol levels in pigs. The manner of cholesterol removal by strain N7 corresponded to the manner of its growth. The growth of strain N7 (growth yield and growth efficiency) was enhanced. The fatty acid composition of the cells of strain N7 was altered by removing cholesterol from the media. The ability to remove cholesterol was also observed in the heat-killed cells of strain N7. However, the amount of cholesterol removed by the cells during growth was significantly higher than that removed by the heat-killed cells. Thus, strain N7 has the ability to remove cholesterol from media independently of whether cells are viable. These results indicate that administration of strain N7 in vivo may well be promising on the hypocholesterolemic effect.
TI  - Production of Gouda cheese and Camembert with probiotic cultures: the suitability of some commercial probiotic cultures to be implemented in cheese.
AB  - The behaviour of 10 probiotic cultures (L. acidophilus, Bifidobacterium sp., L. rhamnosus and L. paracasei) was examined during the production and ripening of Gouda cheese and Camembert. The overall objective of this research project was to obtain a product (cheese) containing at least 10(7) probiotic cfu/g. In general 10(6) cfu of a probiotic culture must be implemented per ml cheese milk, together with the cheesestarter, to reach this objective. L. paracasei sp. have the ability to grow more than 2 log units during cheese ripening. A lower inoculation value can be considered for these cultures.
TI  - Susceptibility of Lactobacillus spp. to antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Bacteria used as probiotics or in starter cultures may serve as hosts of antibiotic resistance genes, which can be transferred to pathogenic bacteria. Before launching a starter culture or a probiotic product into the market, it is therefore important to verify that the single bacterial isolates (strains) do not contain transferable resistance genes. A study has been undertaken to establish the levels of susceptibility of Lactobacillus spp. to various antimicrobial agents. This is a prerequisite for differentiating putative transferable resistance from natural resistance. A selection of 62 strains has been screened with the use of the Etest (ABBiodisk, Stockholm, Sweden) for their susceptibility to 25 antimicrobial agents. The strains belonged to the following species: Lactobacillus plantarum/pentosus, L. rhamnosus, L. paracasei, L. sakei, L. curvatus and species of the L. acidophilus group: L. johnsonii, L. crispatus, L. gasseri, and L. acidophilus. The results from the Etests have shown that the level of susceptibility to the antimicrobial agents is species-dependent. For the following antimicrobial agents, susceptibility varied several folds between species: vancomycin, teicoplanin, tetracycline, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, fusidic acid, and clindamycin. The differences between the species were more subtle for the rest of the tested antimicrobial agents. On the basis of the result, it was possible to suggest minimal inhibition concentrations (MICs) for the individual Lactobacillus species to be used as a microbiological breakpoint when screening strains for transferable resistance genes.
TI  - Evaluation of yeast extracts as growth media supplements for lactococci and lactobacilli by using automated spectrophotometry.
AB  - An automated spectrophotometric (AS) method was used to evaluate the growth-promoting ability of yeast extracts (YE) on cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris. The AS data were compared to that obtained from classical shake flask fermentations and from 250 ml bioreactors equipped with pH control. In assays involving the evaluation of 26 different commercial YE, maximum growth rate (&mgr;(max)) values determined with the AS unit ranged from 0.25 to 0.45 h(-1) for Lb. acidophilus and from 0.10 to 0.40 h(-1) for Lc. cremoris. Good correlations were obtained between AS data and manual sampling from the shake flasks or the bioreactors for mmax, as well as maximum optical density (OD(max)). The AS method is thus useful as a screening tool for the selection of YE lots in media formulation. Species reacted differently to the 26 YE, but less variation was observed between strains of the same species. This suggests that a producer of various lactococci or lactobacilli can expect a relatively constant response to a given YE lot between strains of the same species. However, it should not be assumed that the YE having the best growth-promoting properties for Lb. acidophilus will also be the best media supplements for the growth of Lc. cremoris.
TI  - Surface characteristics of lactobacilli isolated from human vagina.
AB  - In the present paper, the taxonomic classification of 134 lactobacilli isolates from vaginal samples of 200 women of Tucuman, Argentina, is reported. They were clustered in three metabolic groups of the genus Lactobacillus, most belonging to the obligately homofermentative group (56%), mainly represented by Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii and L. acidophilus. In the facultatively heterofermentative group (24%), the dominant species were L. paracasei subsp. paracasei and L. agilis, and in the obligately heterofermentative group (20%), L. brevis was the dominant species. All strains were studied for surface characteristics and adhesion-predicting properties. A correlation between the methods employed for hydrophobicity testing of the different isolates (Microbial Adhesion to Hydrocarbons and Salt Aggregation Test) is reported. Most strains were highly hydrophobic. Their hemagglutination capability with human erythrocytes was also tested, which was positive only for a few strains. Some isolates were self-aggregating. From our results, strains that shared the properties assayed were selected for further testing of some other desirable characteristics, such as antagonistic substance production, adhesion to biological substrates, and appropriate technological properties, to suggest the elaboration of a probiotic for the vaginal tract.
TI  - Accelerated storage testing of freeze-dried and controlled low-temperature vacuum dehydrated Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  
TI  - Esterolytic and lipolytic activities of lactic acid bacteria isolated from ewe's  milk and cheese.
AB  - In the present work, we report on the esterase and lipase activities of lactic acid bacteria representing the genera Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus, and Enterococcus isolated from ewe's milk and cheeses. Esterase activity was studied using alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 12 carbon atoms and postelectrophoretic detection. The lactic acid bacteria evaluated had intracellular esterase activities, which preferentially degraded the alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 6 carbon atoms. By studying postelectrophoretic patterns, it was found that some strains presented more than one esterase. Lactobacillus plantarum O236 showed four enzymes that hydrolyze carboxyl ester linkages with different specificity. Lipase activity was studied in intracellular and extracellular fractions using tributyrin, tricaprylin, triolein, and milk fat as substrates. The intracellular and extracellular fractions of Leuconostoc mesenteroides O257, Lactobacillus plantarum O236, and Lactobacillus acidophilus O177 were able to hydrolyze tributyrin. L. plantarum O186, L. acidophilus O252, Enterococcus faecium O174 and O426, and Enterococcus faecalis Ov409 showed lipase activity associated with the intracellular fraction on tributyrin. Lactococcus lactis O233, L. plantarum O155, and Lactobacillus casei O190 did not hydrolyze triglycerides. Not all strains that showed esterase activity exhibited high activity on triglycerides. Esterase and lipase activities were species- and strain-specific. Wide variations in activity between strains highlight the need for selecting appropriate starters to produce enzyme-modified cheese as well as accelerated ripened cheese.
TI  - Correlations between bacterial levels in autologous subgingival plaque and saliva of adult Sudanese.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess levels of oral bacteria and their correlations in paired samples of saliva and subgingival plaque in a population of adult Sudanese. Whole saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples from six probing sites of one tooth in each jaw were obtained from 56 Sudanese adults (mean age 35.2+/-8.9 years). Levels of 24 oral bacteria in the autologous saliva and pooled plaque sample of each subject were assessed by DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. There were significantly ( P< or =0.01) higher percentages of subjects with > or =10(5) bacterial cells of Prevotella intermedia, Campylobacter rectus, Veillonella parvula, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus salivarius, and Leptotrichia buccalis and significantly ( P< or =0.01) lower percentages with Treponema denticola in saliva than in subgingival plaque. The detection frequencies at > or =10(6) bacterial cells were significantly higher for Selenomonas sputigena, S. anginosus, Streptococcus sanguis, and S. salivarius and significantly lower for Porphyromonas gingivalis in saliva than in subgingival plaque ( P< or =0.01). Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, S. sputigena, S. sanguis, and Streptococcus mitis demonstrated significant ( P< or =0.05) positive correlations between their levels in plaque and saliva. This study indicates that the levels of P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, S. sputigena, S. sanguis, and S. mitis correlate significantly in saliva and subgingival plaque and that higher accuracy of detection and assessment of the levels of these bacteria in the oral cavity may be achieved by concurrent sampling of saliva and subgingival plaque.
TI  - Development of a membrane-array method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  - A membrane-array method was developed for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples without using the expensive microarray-arrayer and laser-scanner. The 16S rDNA sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. Three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to nitrocellulose membranes. Digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled 16S rDNAs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from human fecal samples or pure cultured bacteria using two universal primers, and were hybridized to the membrane-array. Hybridization signals were read by NBT/BCIP color development. The 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus, B. fragilis, B. distasonis, Clostridium clostridiiforme, C. leptum, Fusobacterium prausnitzii, Peptostreptococcus productus, Ruminococcus obeum, R. bromii, R. callidus, R. albus, Bifidobacterium longum, B. adolescentis, B. infantis, Eubacterium biforme, E. aerofaciens, Lactobacillus acidophilus,Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecium. The two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16S rDNA from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. The hybridization results indicated that the membrane-array method is a reliable technique for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples. The result was also confirmed by using specific PCR methods for these bacteria.
TI  - Structural and functional analysis of the S-layer protein crystallisation domain  of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356: evidence for protein-protein interaction of two subdomains.
AB  - The structure of the crystallisation domain, SAN, of the S(A)-protein of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 was analysed by insertion and deletion mutagenesis, and by proteolytic treatment. Mutant S(A)-protein synthesised in Escherichia coli with 7-13 amino acid insertions near the N terminus or within regions of sequence variation in SAN (amino acid position 7, 45, 114, 125, 193), or in the cell wall-binding domain (position 345) could form crystalline sheets, whereas insertions in conserved regions or in regions with predicted secondary structure elements (positions 30, 67, 88 and 156) destroyed this capacity. FACscan analysis of L.acidophilus synthesising three crystallising and one non-crystallising S(A)-protein c-myc (19 amino acid residues) insertion mutant was performed with c-myc antibodies. Fluorescence was most pronounced for insertions at positions 125 and 156, less for position 45 and severely reduced for position 7. By cytometric flow sorting a transformant harbouring the mutant S(A)-protein gene (position 125) was isolated that showed an increased fluorescense signal. Immunofluorescence microscopy suggested that the transformant synthesized mutant S(A)-protein only. PCR analysis of the transformant grown in the absence of selection pressure indicated that the mutant allele was stably integrated in the chromosome. Proteolytic treatment of S(A)-protein indicated that only sites near the middle of SAN are susceptible, although potential cleavage sites are present through the entire molecule. Expression in E.coli of DNA sequences encoding the two halves of SAN yielded peptides that could oligomerize. Our results indicate that SAN consists of a approximately 12kDa N and a approximately 18kDa C-terminal subdomain linked by a surface exposed loop. The capacity of S(A)-protein of L.acidophilus to present epitopes, up to approximately 19 amino acid residues in length, at the bacterial surface in a genetically stable form, makes the system, in principle, suitable for application as an oral delivery vehicle.
TI  - Survival of freeze-dried Lactobacillus acidophilus immobilized in kappa-carrageenan gel.
AB  
TI  - Fructooligosaccharides and Lactobacillus acidophilus modify gut microbial populations, total tract nutrient digestibilities and fecal protein catabolite concentrations in healthy adult dogs.
AB  - The objective of this research was to determine whether fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and (or) Lactobacillus acidophilus (LAC) affected concentrations of gut microbial populations, fermentative end products and nutrient digestibilities in healthy adult dogs. Two experiments were performed using 40 adult dogs (20 dogs/experiment). Dogs in each experiment were randomly assigned to one of 4 treatments. Twice daily, treatments were given orally via gelatin capsules: 1) 2 g sucrose + 80 mg cellulose; 2) 2 g FOS + 80 mg cellulose; 3) 2 g sucrose + 1 x 10(9) colony forming units (cfu) LAC; or 4) 2 g FOS + 1 x 10(9) cfu LAC. Data were analyzed by the General Linear Models procedure of SAS. In Experiment 1, FOS resulted in lower (P = 0.08) Clostridium perfringens and greater fecal butyrate (P = 0.06) and lactate (P < 0.05) concentrations. In Experiment 2, FOS supplementation increased (P < 0.05) bifidobacteria, increased lactobacilli (P = 0.08), increased fecal lactate (P = 0.06) and butyrate (P < 0.05), and decreased (P < 0.05) fecal ammonia, isobutyrate, isovalerate and total branched-chain fatty acid concentrations. Dogs fed LAC had the highest fecal concentrations of hydrogen sulfide and methanethiol in Experiment 1 and dimethyl sulfide in Experiment 2, whereas dogs fed FOS had the lowest concentrations of these compounds. Overall, FOS appeared to enhance indices of gut health by positively altering gut microbial ecology and fecal protein catabolites, whereas LAC was more effective when fed in combination with FOS rather than fed alone.
TI  - Effectiveness of current therapy of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - The study was conducted in order to evaluate effectiveness of the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV) with different therapeutic regimes according to recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO). During a one-year period (February 2000-February 2001) the Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) Center was visited by 482 women aged 14-51. The diagnosis of BV was established by standard methods: Amsel's clinical criteria and Gram stain of vaginal discharge. The first-line treatment was oral Metronidazole 2 g single dose. Second line was Metronidazole 500 mg twice daily orally for 7 days or oral Clindamycin 300 mg twice daily for seven days. BV was confirmed in 74 women (15.4%). Most often it was observed in women aged 17-30 years of age. Thirty-three (44.6% of total) were young women 14-21 years of age. Thirty-one (42%) women received a follow-up examination and of those, 11 (38.7%) needed a repeat treatment for BV due to unsatisfactory results of this treatment. It is concluded that treatment of BV with standard methods was not always effective with no significant difference between women under 21 years and older women found in regards to response to treatment. Besides antibiotic treatment, the so-called Probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus) can be taken into consideration as an alternative treatment. Additional research about the therapeutic effect of this type of drugs is needed.
TI  - Identification and characterization of novel surface proteins in Lactobacillus johnsonii and Lactobacillus gasseri.
AB  - We have identified and sequenced the genes encoding the aggregation-promoting factor (APF) protein from six different strains of Lactobacillus johnsonii and Lactobacillus gasseri. Both species harbor two apf genes, apf1 and apf2, which are in the same orientation and encode proteins of 257 to 326 amino acids. Multiple alignments of the deduced amino acid sequences of these apf genes demonstrate a very strong sequence conservation of all of the genes with the exception of their central regions. Northern blot analysis showed that both genes are transcribed, reaching their maximum expression during the exponential phase. Primer extension analysis revealed that apf1 and apf2 harbor a putative promoter sequence that is conserved in all of the genes. Western blot analysis of the LiCl cell extracts showed that APF proteins are located on the cell surface. Intact cells of L. johnsonii revealed the typical cell wall architecture of S-layer-carrying gram-positive eubacteria, which could be selectively removed with LiCl treatment. In addition, the amino acid composition, physical properties, and genetic organization were found to be quite similar to those of S-layer proteins. These results suggest that APF is a novel surface protein of the Lactobacillus acidophilus B-homology group which might belong to an S-layer-like family.
TI  - Characterization of the protein-synthesis dependent adaptive acid tolerance response in Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Exposure of L. acidophilus CRL 639 cells to sublethal adaptive acid conditions (pH 5.0 for 60 min) was found to confer protection against subsequent exposure to lethal pH (pH 3.0). Adaptation, which only occurred in complex media, was dependent on de novo protein synthesis and was inhibited by amino acid analogues. There was no modification in the protein synthesis rate during adaptation, but the protein degradation rate decreased. Synthesis of acid stress proteins may increase the stability of pre-existing proteins. By 2D-PAGE, induction of nine acid stress proteins and repression of several housekeeping proteins was observed. Putative heat shock proteins DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE, GroES and GroEL (70, 43, 24, 10 and 55 kDa, respectively) were among the proteins whose synthesis was induced in response to acid adaptation.
TI  - Effect of milk base and starter culture on acidification, texture, and probiotic  cell counts in fermented milk processing.
AB  - In the present work, the compared effect of milk base and starter culture on acidification, texture, growth, and stability of probiotic bacteria in fermented milk processing, was studied. Two strains of probiotic bacteria were used, Lactobacillus acidophilus LA5 and L. rhamnosus LR35, with two starter cultures. One starter culture consisted only of Streptococcus thermophilus ST7 (single starter culture); the other was a yogurt mixed culture with S. thermophilus ST7 and L. bulgaricus LB12 (mixed starter culture). For the milk base preparation, four commercial dairy ingredients were tested (two milk protein concentrates and two casein hydrolysates). The resulting fermented milks were compared to those obtained with control milk (without enrichment) and milk added with skim milk powder. The performance of the two probiotic strains were opposite. L. acidophilus LA5 grew well on milk but showed a poor stability during storage. L. rhamnosus LR35 grew weakly on milk but was remarkably stable during storage. With the strains tested in this study, the use of the single starter culture and the addition of casein hydrolysate gave the best probiotic cell counts. The fermentation time was of about 11 h, and the probiotic level after five weeks of storage was greater than 106 cfu/ml for L. acidophilus LA5 and 10(7) cfu/ml for L. rhamnosus LR35. However, an optimization of the level of casein hydrolysate added to milk base has to be done, in order to improve texture and flavor when using this dairy ingredient.
TI  - Probiotics and Helicobacter pylori eradication.
AB  - The need for new strategies for Helicobacter pylori eradication, alternative or complementary to antibiotic therapy, has recently claimed the attention of many investigators. Pre-clinical studies have shown the inhibition of Helicobacter pylori growth by Lactobacilli and the anti-Helicobacter pylori action of Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei subspecies rhamnosus strains, possibly due to the production of lactic acid or to the secretion of an autolysin. Clinical studies have demonstrated a persistent reduction in delta over baseline values at the 13C urea breath test independently of omeprazole administration with Lactobacillus acidophilus La1, the eradication in 6 out of 14 patients with Lactobacillus acidophilus alone, positive results in patients in which a standard Helicobacter pylori triple therapy was randomly supplemented with Lactobacillus acidophilus.
TI  - Probiotics in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
AB  - Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea is a common event. In some cases, it could represent a life-threatening event. Clostridium difficile colitis is a further distinct complication of antibiotic administration. Treatment options for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and Clostridium difficile colitis include supplementation with several types of probiotics, as overviewed in this paper. Three randomised, double-blind, controlled clinical trials show a therapeutic effect of Saccharomyces boulardii in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. The efficacy of Lactobacillus acidophilus and bulgaricus has also been ascertained in two double-blind controlled studies. Other studies focusing on Lactobacillus as a new preventive agent for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea are not double-blind. Among these, a positive effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Bifidobacterium longum and Enterococcus faecium SF68 has been reported. Effectiveness of probiotics in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea has, therefore, a consistent scientific rationale, however few studies have performed an assessment of bacterial recovery in stools, and this approach may be helpful in deciding a more rigorous dose standardisation.
TI  - Prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in infants by probiotics.
AB  - Probiotics administration has been claimed to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The investigators thus conducted a double blind, placebo controlled study of providing probiotics to infants and children with severe bacterial infections and receiving broad spechum antibiotics. The results of the study showed that the group receiving probiotics had fewer diarrheal episodes (37.5%) than the control group (80%), although the numbers were too small for statistical analysis. In conclusion, probiotics administration to patients receiving high doses of broad spectrum antibiotics may prevent the occurrence of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. A further study with a larger number is required.
TI  - Cytokine production by the murine macrophage cell line J774.1 after exposure to lactobacilli.
AB  - Eleven strains of lactobacilli were tested for their ability to induce the murine macrophage-like cell line J774.1 to secrete cytokines. Some of the bacteria tested induce the production of interleukin(IL) 6, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-alpha) by J774.1 cells. Seven strains also induced the production of IL-10. However, no IL-1beta was produced. Lactobacillus acidophilus TMC 0356 significantly induced the production of more IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-alpha than the other bacteria tested (p < 0.0001; ANOVA). These results suggest that lactobacilli can activate macrophages to secrete both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Selected strains might be used to bring about pro or antiinflammatory immune reactions.
TI  - Microencapsulation of L. acidophilus (La-05) and B. lactis (Bb-12) and evaluation of their survival at the pH values of the stomach and in bile.
AB  - Microcapsules were prepared using the probiotic microorganisms Lactobacillus acidophilus (La-05) and Bifidobacterium lactis (Bb-12) and the spray drying technique and cellulose acetate phthalate as the wall material. This study evaluated the resistance of these microorganisms to drying at three temperatures and also the in vitro tolerance of the free and microencapsulated form to pH values and bile concentrations similar to those found in the human stomach and intestine. With an air entry temperature of 130 degrees C and exit temperature of 75 degrees C, the number of viable cells of B. lactis was practically unaltered, whereas the population of L. acidophilus was reduced by two logarithmic cycles. B. lactis was more resistant to the drying process than L. acidophilus under all conditions tested. The morphology of the microcapsules was determined by scanning electron microscopy and the microcapsules presented a rounded external surface containing concavities, a continuous wall with no apparent porosity, average size of 22 microm, moisture content varying from 5.3 to 3.2% and water activity between 0.230 and 0.204. After inoculation into HCl solutions with pH values adjusted to 1 and 2, incubated anaerobically at 37 degrees C, and plated after 0, 1 and 2 h of incubation, microcapsules were effective in protecting the microorganisms, while the populations of both free microorganisms were eliminated after only 1 h at the acidic conditions. Microencapsulated B. lactis and L. acidophilus, both free and microencapsulated, were also resistant after 12h to bile solutions.
TI  - 16S ribosomal DNA analysis of the faecal lactobacilli composition of human subjects consuming a probiotic strain Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM.
AB  - AIMS: The aims of this study were to evaluate the ability of exogenous Lactobacillus acidophilus strain NCFM to survive through the human gastro-intestinal (GI) tract, and to evaluate the selectivity of Rogosa SL medium for faecal lactobacilli. METHODS AND RESULTS: The composition of the faecal lactobacilli of 10 healthy subjects was monitored for two weeks prior to, two weeks during and two weeks after the administration of the Lact. acidophilus strain NCFM consumed with skim milk (daily dose 10(10) viable cells). Fresh faecal samples were collected, processed and cultured on Rogosa SL selective medium for lactobacilli enumeration. Colonies demonstrating various morphologies were identified and purified for 16S ribosomal DNA sequence analysis for speciation of colonial genotype. The species composition of cultivable faecal lactobacilli changed considerably during consumption of the strain NCFM. CONCLUSIONS: The probiotic Lact. acidophilus strain NCFM can survive through the human GI tract, but cannot colonize itself during the two-week consumption. Rogosa SL medium is selective for faecal lactobacilli. However, genetic analysis is required for colony speciation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: It is demonstrated that continuous consumption is necessary to maintain a high population of the probiotic strain, and that the Rogosa SL medium is reliable.
TI  - Variable response to exogenous Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM consumed in different delivery vehicles.
AB  - AIMS: To study the effects of the delivery vehicle for Lactobacillus acidophilus  on the human faecal microbiota. Our hypotheses were that (i) the delivery vehicle would influence faecal lactobacilli numbers and (ii) consumption of Lact. acidophilus would influence the populations of Bifidobacterium and hydrogen sulphide-producing bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Ten subjects each received Lact. acidophilus with skim milk or water. Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and hydrogen sulphide-producing bacterial populations were analysed before, during and after each treatment. Regardless of the vehicle, faecal lactobacilli populations changed during treatment. Bifidobacteria and the hydrogen sulphide-producing bacteria underwent no statistically significant population changes. Intra- and intersubject variability was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The vehicle in which Lact. acidophilus was delivered did not influence faecal lactobacilli numbers. Consumption of Lact. acidophilus did not influence the populations of Bifidobacterium and hydrogen sulphide-producing bacteria. The lactobacilli populations of subjects were variable. The fed lactobacilli did not appear to colonize the gastrointestinal tract. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: We provide evidence that (i) there was no collective advantage to using skim milk as a delivery vehicle vs water; (ii) exogenous Lact. acidophilus did not affect endogenous bifidobacteria or hydrogen sulphide-producing bacteria; (iii) data should be carefully examined before pooling for analysis and (iv) continuous feeding was required to maintain an elevated lactobacilli population.
TI  - Probiotics--a therapy in search of a disease.
AB  
TI  - Fructooligosaccharides and Lactobacillus acidophilus modify bowel function and protein catabolites excreted by healthy humans.
AB  - The objective of this experiment was to determine whether supplementation with fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and (or) Lactobacillus acidophilus (LAC) affected bowel function and fermentative end-product concentrations in feces of healthy humans. Subjects (n = 68) were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study design. After a 4-wk baseline period, subjects consumed one of the following treatments twice daily for 4 wk: 1) 3 g sucrose + 80 mg cornstarch; 2) 3 g FOS + 80 mg cornstarch; 3) 3 g sucrose + 1 x 10(9) colony-forming units (cfu) LAC; or 4) 3 g FOS + 1 x 10(9) cfu LAC. Subjects completed 7-d bowel function forms and 3-d dietary records before collection of fresh stool samples at wk 4, 6 and 8. Statistical analyses were performed on differences from baseline using the General Linear Models procedure of SAS. Fructooligosaccharides decreased fecal ammonia (P = 0.07) and isovalerate (P = 0.12) concentrations at wk 6. At wk 8, FOS tended (P = 0.11) to increase fecal putrescine concentrations. Lactobacillus decreased fecal organic matter percentage at wk 6 (P < 0.05) and 8 (P = 0.07). At wk 6 and 8, LAC increased (P < 0.05) fecal 2-methylindole, total indole, and total indole and phenol concentrations. At wk 8, LAC decreased fecal agmatine (P = 0.08) and phenylethylamine (P < 0.05) concentrations. In conclusion, FOS and LAC modified several metabolites associated with gut health, with FOS tending to be beneficial (decreased fecal protein catabolites) and LAC being negative (increased fecal protein catabolites).
TI  - Diabetes and the risk of acute urinary tract infection among postmenopausal women.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the presence of diabetes alters the risk of acute urinary tract infection (UTI) in postmenopausal women. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A case-control study of the Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound (GHC), a staff-model nonprofit health maintenance organization in Washington State, was conducted. Subjects were women aged 55-75 years who had been members of GHC for at least 1 year and who had had an acute symptomatic UTI within the preceding month. Laboratory files were used to identify women with a urine culture that grew > or =10(5) colonies of a urinary pathogen. Medical records were reviewed to confirm the presence of acute, clinically symptomatic UTI. Control subjects were randomly selected from the GHC enrollment file, screened to remove women with recent UTI, and frequency matched to cases by age within 2 years. An interviewer ascertained self-reported clinician-diagnosed diabetes. Diagnosis of diabetes was confirmed by the GHC diabetes registry. A subsample of women underwent measurement of postvoid residual bladder volume (n = 748) and culture of vaginal flora (n = 454). RESULTS: Of the 901 case and 913 control subjects, diabetes was reported in 13.1 and 6.8%, respectively. The health plan diabetes registry confirmed the diagnosis in 92% of women who self-reported the condition. The age-adjusted odds ratio (OR) for UTI in relation to self-reported clinician-diagnosed diabetes was 2.2 (95% CI 1.6-3.0). Adjustment for frequency of sexual intercourse and history of UTI had little effect on this estimate. Compared with nondiabetic women, higher UTI odds were seen in subjects who used oral hypoglycemic agents (OR 2.9 [95% CI 1.7-5.1]) and insulin (2.6 [1.5-4.6]) but not in subjects with untreated diabetes or diabetes treated by lifestyle changes (1.3 [0.7-2.3]). No significant difference was seen in the OR for UTI in diabetic women with disease of shorter duration (<10 years, OR 1.9) or longer duration (> or =10 years, OR 2.6) or in relation to HbA(1c) level. Similar microbiologic pathogens were seen in diabetic and nondiabetic women. No significant differences were seen by diabetes status in mean postvoid residual bladder volume or vaginal flora. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes under pharmacologic treatment is associated with increased risk of clinically apparent UTI in postmenopausal women.
TI  - Mutations within the putative active site of heterodimeric deoxyguanosine kinase  block the allosteric activation of the deoxyadenosine kinase subunit.
AB  - Replacement of the Asp-84 residue of the deoxyguanosine kinase subunit of the tandem deoxyadenosine kinase/ deoxyguanosine kinase (dAK/dGK) from Lactobacillus acidophilus R-26 by Ala, Asn, or Glu produced increased Km values for deoxyguanosine on dGK. However, it did not seem to affect the binding of Mg-ATP. The Asp-84 dGK replacements had no apparent effect on the binding of deoxyadenosine by dAK. However, the mutant dGKs were no longer inhibited by dGTP, normally a potent distal endproduct inhibitor of dGK. Moreover, the allosteric activation of dAK activity by dGTP or dGuo was lost in the modified heterodimeric dAK/dGK enzyme. Therefore, it seems very likely that Asp-84 participates in dGuo binding at the active site of the dGK subunit of dAK/dGK from Lactobacillus acidophilus R-26.
TI  - Comparison of two selective media for the detection and enumeration of Lactobacilli in human faeces.
AB  - The enumeration of faecal bacteria is an important requirement for many studies of bowel health. One approach is the use of selective culture media for the culture and identification of genera or species from faeces. This study compares the culture of Lactobacilli from dilution series of faecal samples from six healthy human volunteers on two commonly used media, LAMVAB and Rogosa agar. Colonies were counted after a 72-h anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees C, and colony morphology recorded by a single observer. DNA was isolated from a representative number of colonies and genus-specific PCR, single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and DNA sequencing performed. Total colony counts ranged from <3.00 to 7.48 log(10) cfu/g of faeces for LAMVAB and 5.09 to 7.66 log(10) cfu/g for Rogosa. For each subject, the total colony count was higher on Rogosa than that obtained with LAMVAB agar. SSCP analysis and DNA sequencing indicated that colony morphology was not an accurate predictor of genus identity. Growth of two species, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus gasseri, was not supported on LAMVAB medium. Rogosa agar was more likely to support growth of non-Lactobacillus species. Therefore, neither medium gave a fully accurate representation of the Lactobacilli species present in human faecal samples.
TI  - [The nutritional status change the effectiveness of a dietary supplement of lactic bacteria on the emerging of respiratory tract diseases in children].
AB  - One hundred children 6 to 24 month old, normal or undernourished according to weight for height index, received during three months--autumn to winter--a dietary supplement of live Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus Casei, 10(7)-10(8)/ml in fermented milk (LB) or an equivalent amount of fluid milk (L) as control. Children's follow-up was performed as outpatients in the Hospital Posadas (Great Buenos Aires). Episodes of respiratory tract infections were recorded and classified according to severity as: Pneumonia (N); Bronchitis (B), Recurrent Obstructive Bronchitis (BOR) and upper respiratory tract infections (CVAS). 58% of children fitted the study protocol, 22 in the LB and 36 in the L group; 21 were undernourished and 37 presented normal weight/height. No deaths were recorded. Total episodes were 103: 34 in LB and 69 in L, that means a frequency of 1.55 and 1.92 episodes/children respectively. In LB a maximum of 3 episodes/children was recorded, meanwhile the number reached 7 in L (p = 0.0373). Severity was higher in L than LB: 0.06 vs. 0 for N; 0.69 vs. 0.45 for B + BOR and 1.17 vs. 1.09 for CVAS. In the control group frequency of severe pathologies was about twice in undernourished than in normal: 0.08 vs. 0.04 for N; 1.08 vs. 0.50 for B + BOR; no difference was found for CVAS. Live lactobacillus supplement suppressed pneumonia and decreased bronchitis in undernourished as well as in normal. In this study undernutrition not only increased the chance of suffering severe acute respiratory tract infections but also impaired the effectiveness of the supplement to decrease severity. The effect is explained on the basis of the immunocompetence depression linked to an inadequate nutritional status.
TI  - Monitoring the migration behavior of living microorganisms in capillary electrophoresis using laser-induced fluorescence detection with a charge-coupled device imaging system.
AB  - Remarkably high apparent peak efficiencies (10(6)-10(9) theoretical plates per meter) in capillary electrophoresis (CE) could be achieved in the separation of two different kinds of bacteria and Baker's yeast using poly(ethylene oxide) as a necessary buffer additive. In these applications no deliberate stacking procedure was implemented. Seemingly, the investigated organisms in this study behave differently than molecules under an applied electric field. For molecules, these extremely high efficiencies are very unusual. Using a 488 nm argon-ion laser coupled to a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera it was possible to monitor the migration behavior of stained microorganisms over a length of 10 cm. This part simulates the very beginning of the CE run. In specific cases 60-70% of the monitored detection window could be filled with analyte without significant loss in peak efficiency. For a mixture of two different microorganisms the occurring separation process could be followed in detail. The effect of buffer concentration, polymer type, polymer molecular weight, polymer concentration, pH, and the effect of injection time was investigated. The expansion of fast and reproducible CE separations to other unicellular organisms may become a powerful tool in microbiological science and technology.
TI  - Long-term consumption of fermented dairy products over 6 months increases HDL cholesterol.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Assessment of the hypocholesterolaemic effect of yoghurt supplemented  with Lactobacillus acidophilus 145 and Bifidobacterium longum 913 in women. DESIGN: The cross-over study consisted of three periods (7 weeks each): first period, control yoghurt for all 29 women; second period, probiotic yoghurt for 18 women, control yoghurt for 11 women; third period, the reverse of that in the second period. SETTING: Department of Nutritional Physiology, Institute of Nutritional Science, Friedrich Schiller University, Jena. SUBJECTS: Twenty-nine healthy women, aged 19-56 y. Fifteen of these were normocholesterolaemic and 14 women were hypercholesterolaemic. INTERVENTION: Yoghurt (300 g) daily containing 3.5% fat and starter cultures of Streptococcus thermophilus and L. lactis. Probiotic yoghurt was the control yoghurt enriched with L. acidophilus 145, B. longum 913 and 1% oligofructose (synbiotic). RESULTS: The mean serum concentration of total cholesterol and the LDL cholesterol was not influenced by the synbiotic (P>0.05). The HDL concentration increased significantly by 0.3 mmol/l (P=0.002). The ratio of LDL/HDL cholesterol decreased from 3.24 to 2.48 (P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The long-term daily consumption of 300 g yoghurt over a period of 21 weeks (control and synbiotic) increased the serum concentration of HDL cholesterol and lead to the desired improvement of the LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus on Helicobacter pylori in peptic ulcer patients: in vitro study.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) have been introduced into many fermented dairy products. The presence of L. acidophilus appears to decrease Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) density in the human stomach and could enhance antibiotic therapy for H. pylori eradication. This study was designed to determine the optimal density of L. acidophilus that has a maximum inhibitory effect on H. pylori in peptic ulcer patients. To determine whether L. acidophilus has an inhibitory effect on H. pylori isolated from peptic ulcer patients and to determine whether the optimal density of L. acidophilus has a maximum inhibitory effect on H. pylori isolated from peptic ulcer patients. H. pylori was isolated from gastric biopsy specimens of peptic ulcer patients. The suspension of pure H. pylori colonies were inoculated into the broth and adjusted to match the density of No.3 MacFarland standard (approximately 9x10(8) cells/ml). Forty microliters of the suspension were equally spread onto each quadrant of the plate and left to dry. L. acidophilus was prepared from LC-1 (Nestle Research Center, Switzerland). They were grown on blood agar and incubated overnight at 37 degrees C. The suspension of L. acidophilus was inoculated into the broth and adjusted to match the density of No.1, No.2, No.3 and No.4 MacFarland standard (approximately 3x10(8), 6x10(8), 9x10(8) and 12x10(8) cells/ml respectively). Ten microliters of each density of L. acidophilus was dropped onto each quadrant of a previously inoculated H. pylori plate and then the plate was kept under microaerophilic conditions for 72 hours. Inhibition clear halo zone of H. pylori around the colonies of L. acidophilus was interpreted as the inhibitory effect. H. pylori were isolated from gastric biopsy specimens of fifteen peptic ulcer patients (eleven patients with gastric ulcer and four patients with duodenal ulcer). A total of sixty tests of inhibitory effect of L. acidophilus on H. pylori were evaluated in the present study. L. acidophilus had inhibitory effect on H. pylori in 13/15 patients (86.67%) and L. acidophilus in the density of No.3 MacFarland standard had a significantly higher inhibitory effect on H. pylori in the density of No.3 MacFarland than that of No.1 (60% vs 20%; p<0.05), No.2 (60% vs 20%; p<0.05) and No.4 (60% vs 20%; p<0.05) MacFarland standard. In conclusion, L. acidophilus has an inhibitory effect on H. pylori isolated from peptic ulcer patients. Approximately an equal density of L. acidophilus on H. pylori has the most favorable effect. This optimal density of L. acidophilus should have maximum effect on H. pylori clearance and could enhance antibiotic therapy for H. pylori eradication in humans.
TI  - New rapid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect antibodies against bacterial surface antigens using filtration plates.
AB  - An easy and rapid ELISA system, Filtration ELISA, to detect antibodies against bacterial cell surface antigens was developed using a 96-well filtration plate fitted with a 0.22microm membrane (MultiScreen-GV, Millipore). Bacterial whole cells were used as antigens without fixing the cells with formalin etc. The whole cell antigens were washed by vacuum filtration through a filter and resuspended in washing buffer. Assay reactions could be done in the wells without losing the solution. The technique was established using antisera of mice immunized with Escherichia coli, and then evaluated by assaying antibodies to Shiga-toxin producing E. coli O157:H7 (STEC), Staphylococcus aureus and Lactobacillus acidophilus in fecal extracts of 157 children who had eaten school lunches contaminated with STEC in comparison with 25 age-matched control children. The lunch group showed significantly higher IgA antibody titers against STEC than the control group (p<0.0005), but not against L. acidphilus. The results indicate that Filtration ELISA is a quantitative and specific technique for measuring antibodies against antigens on the surface of bacteria without extracting antigens from the bacteria. This technique is widely applicable to the assay of antibodies in various samples including serum and fecal extract against various kinds of bacteria.
TI  - Microbial profile on metallic and ceramic bracket materials.
AB  - The placement of orthodontic appliances creates a favorable environment for the accumulation of a microbiota and food residues, which, in time, may cause caries or exacerbate any pre-existing periodontal disease. The purpose of the present study was to compare the total bacterial counts present on metallic and ceramic orthodontic brackets in order to clarify which bracket type has a higher plaque retaining capacity and to determine the levels of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus spp on both types of brackets. Thirty-two metallic brackets and 24 ceramic brackets were collected from orthodontic patients at the day of debonding. Two brackets were collected from each patient; one from a maxillary central incisor and another from a maxillary second premolar. Sixteen patients who used metallic brackets and 12 patients who used ceramic brackets were sampled. Bacterial populations were studied using "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridization, which uses DNA probes to identify species in complex microbial samples. The significance of differences between groups was determined using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Results showed no significant differences between metallic and ceramic brackets with respect to the caries-inducing S mutans and L acidophilus spp counts. Mean counts of 8 of 35 additional species differed significantly between metallic and ceramic brackets with no obvious pattern favoring one bracket type over the other. This study showed higher mean counts of Treponema denticola, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii, Streptococcus anginosus, and Eubacterium nodatum on metallic brackets while higher counts of Eikenella corrodens, Campylobacter showae, and Selenomonas noxia were found on ceramic brackets.
TI  - Design and evaluation of oligonucleotide-microarray method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  - An oligonucleotide-microarray method was developed for the detection of intestinal bacteria in fecal samples collected from human subjects. The 16S rDNA sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. Three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to glass slides. Cyanine5 (CY5)-labeled 16S rDNAs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from human fecal samples or bacterial DNA using two universal primers and were hybridized to the oligo-microarray. The 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides distasonis, Clostridium clostridiiforme, Clostridium leptum, Fusobacterium prausnitzii, Peptostreptococcus productus, Ruminococcus obeum, Ruminococcus bromii, Ruminococcus callidus, Ruminococcus albus, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium infantis, Eubacterium biforme, Eubacterium aerofaciens, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecium. The two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16S rDNA from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. The hybridization results indicated that the oligo-microarray method developed in this study is a reliable method for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of cecal microbiota in chicken by the use of 16S rDNA clone libraries.
AB  - The chicken cecum contains a great many bacteria, most of which are strict anaerobes. A strictly anaerobe culture-based method was used in the present study, in conjunction with the 16S rDNA clone library, to elucidate bacterial diversity and the phylogenetic relationship of cecal microbiota in the chicken. A comparative 16S rDNA sequence analysis of cultivated strains and retrieved clones from cecal contents was performed. Approximately 90% of the bacterial cells detected by microscopy did not form colonies on a medium 10 in plate-in-bottle. The 19 isolated strains yielded 11 distinct rDNA sequences, 58% of which were classified as low G + C gram-positive bacteria, 26% were related to Bacteroides spp., and 16% were classified as Proteobacteria. Based on the sequence analysis of 164 clones, 24% were identified to belong to 8 known species and 76% were considered to be 65 novel phylotypes. Approximately 94% of cloned sequences were classified into low G + C gram-positive bacteria, 4% were related to Bacteroides spp., and 2% were classified into Proteobacteria. Clostridium subcluster XIVa (38%), Clostridium cluster IV (13%), Lactobacillus spp. (24%), and Bacteroides spp. (4%) were the major groups constituting the cecal microbiota in chicken, in which the Clostridium subcluster XIVa was the most phylogenetically diverse group in chicken cecum. The 16S rDNA sequences of Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. crispatus, L. salivarius, and L. reuteri were the most frequently found in the Lactobacillus group in chicken cecum.
TI  - Characterization of a cryptic plasmid from Lactobacillus fermentum KC5b and its use for constructing a stable Lactobacillus cloning vector.
AB  - Lactobacillus fermentum KC5b, a strain originally isolated from the human vagina, contains a cryptic plasmid pKC5b. The sequence and genetic organization of the 4392-bp plasmid were determined. It contains two convergently oriented replicons, which are homologous to each other and to the stable replicon of the Enterococcus faecium plasmid pMBB1. The two replicons of pKC5b were used either individually or together to construct Lactobacillus-Escherichia coli shuttle plasmids. Only the plasmid pSP1 that carried both replicons transformed lactobacilli, suggesting a complementary function between the two replicons. Since the replicons had a high homology to those of other plasmids that replicate via a theta-like mechanism and no detectable single-stranded intermediates were found for the plasmid, it is possible that pKC5b may replicate via a theta-like mechanism. The new shuttle plasmid pSP1 has been transformed and stably maintained in several Lactobacillus strains. As an initial application, pSP1 was used to clone the S-layer protein gene (slpA) of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 into a heterologous vaginal Lactobacillus strain and achieved surface-bound expression of the protein.
TI  - Time for probiotics.
AB  
TI  - Vaginal lactobacillus flora of healthy Swedish women.
AB  - Species of the Lactobacillus acidophilus complex are generally considered to constitute most of the vaginal Lactobacillus flora, but the flora varies between studies. However, this may be due to difficulties in identifying the closely related species within the L. acidophilus complex by using traditional methods and to variations in the vaginal status of the participants. Two hundred two isolates from the vaginal fluids of 23 Swedish women without bacterial vaginosis, as defined by the criteria of Nugent et al. (R. P. Nugent, M. A. Krohn, and S. L. Hillier, J. Clin. Microbiol. 29:297-301, 1991), were typed by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis and identified to the species level by temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis, multiplex PCR, and 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing. The vaginal flora of most participants was dominated by a single RAPD type, but five of them harbored two RAPD types representing two different species or strains. The most frequently occurring species were Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus iners, and Lactobacillus jensenii. L. iners has not previously been reported as one of the predominant Lactobacillus species in the vagina.
TI  - One repeat of the cell wall binding domain is sufficient for anchoring the Lactobacillus acidophilus surface layer protein.
AB  - The N-terminal repeat (SAC1) of the S-protein of Lactobacillus acidophilus bound  efficiently and specifically to cell wall fragments (CWFs) when fused to green fluorescent protein, whereas the C-terminal repeat (SAC2) did not. Treatment of CWFs with hydrofluoric acid, but not phenol, prevented binding. Apparently, SAC1 is necessary and sufficient for cell wall binding. Our data suggest that SAC anchors the S-protein to a cell wall teichoic acid.
TI  - [Efficacy of a preparation based on Lactobacillus acidophilus for protection from myelotoxic effects of ionizing radiation and antineoplastic cytostatics].
AB  - The ability of a Lactobacillus acidophilius (LA) based preparation to prevent from a myelotoxic damage was studied on (CBA.C57BL/6)F1 mice upon total gamma-irradiation or single intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphan. The antitumor and antimetastatic activity of LA-based preparation was studied in experiments with C57BL/6 mice bearing Lewis lung carcinoma or melanoma B16. The preparation obtained from heat-killed Lactobacillus acidophilius species provides protection of hemopoietic stem cells, as evidenced by the amount of endogenous CFUs increased 3.4-6.7 times. The LA-based preparation favored accelerated overcoming the radiation- and cyclophosphan-induced leukopenia. At the same time, the drug did not affect the proliferative activity and apoptosis of tumor cells, their growth rate, and metastatic activity. Nor did it reduce the efficacy of the experimental tumor radiotherapy.
TI  - An oral introduction of intestinal bacteria prevents the development of a long-term Th2-skewed immunological memory induced by neonatal antibiotic treatment in mice.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent epidemiological studies indicate that antibiotic use in infancy may be associated with an increased risk of developing atopy. Our previous work on animals demonstrated that kanamycin use during infancy promotes a shift in the Th1/Th2 balance towards a Th2-dominant immunity. OBJECTIVE: The first purpose of this study is to clarify whether or not the supplementation of intestinal bacteria can reverse such a Th2-skewed response induced by neonatal antibiotic use. The second objective is to elucidate the contribution of genetic factors to antibiotic-induced immune-deviation. METHODS: BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice at 3 weeks of age were orally administered 600 microg/day of kanamycin sulphate for seven consecutive days. Thereafter, the mice were inoculated with one type of intestinal bacterial species: Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus acidophilus or Bacteroides vulgatus. Blood samples were collected 10 weeks after the cessation of kanamycin treatment, and the effect of the kanamycin treatment on Th1/Th2 balance was evaluated based on in vivo antibody levels. RESULTS: A kanamycin-induced elevation of the serum IgE levels was reversed by the supplementation with Enterococcus faecalis, and to a lesser extent by that with Lactobacillus acidophilus. The IgE/IgG2a ratio in the mice supplemented with Enterococcus faecalis significantly decreased in comparison with that in the kanamycin-treated mice without any bacterial supplementation, while such a ratio was enhanced in the mice inoculated with Bacteroides vulgatus. No antibiotic-induced Th2-skewed response was seen in C57BL/6 mice that are genetically biased towards Th1-dominant immunity. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that adequate probiotic intervention after antibiotic treatment may improve the intestinal ecosystem, and thereby prevent the Th2-shifted immunity induced by neonatal antibiotic use. In addition, the difference of genetic backgrounds also contributes to such an antibiotic-induced Th2-skewed response.
TI  - Effect of lactobacillus supplementation on growth and nutrient utilization in mongrel pups.
AB  - Effect of lactobacillus supplementation was studied in eight Mongrel pups of about 10 weeks of age with a mean body weight of 5.2 kg divided into two equal groups, control (group C) and a probiotic supplemented group (group L). Both groups received the same feed (biscuit) which was for group L supplemented with 2 x 10(7) cfu of a Lactobacillus acidophilus strain. The feeding trial lasted 13 weeks and included a digestibility trial of six day during which feed and faeces were collected to assess intake and digestibility of nutrients. Growth was recorded as weekly live weight change and the physical, chemical and microbiological characteristics of stool were examined periodically to assess the effect of lactobacillus on intestinal health. The biscuits contained 89% DM, 32.6% CP, 5.8% ash and 12.7% EE with TDN, GE and ME content of 890 g, 19.6 MJ and 14.6 MJ per kg DM, respectively. The DM, OM, CP and GE digestibilities were between 76% to 79% and the EE digestibility was 93%. The CF digestibility was negligible (22%). There were no significant differences between the two groups. There was an appetite stimulation and a relatively higher DM intake (10 to 15%) which induced higher daily gain, 102 g in group L vs. 92 g in group C up to 19 weeks of age, the difference declined thereafter. The average daily gain during the whole period was 74.5 +/- 8.0 g and 81.6 +/- 6.0 g in group C and L, respectively, and the difference was statistically non-significant (P > 0.05). The stools showed similar physical properties and composition with acidic pH in both groups. Lactobacillus supplementation caused a competitive establishment in the gastrointestinal tract of pups. It can be concluded that lactobacillus supplementation shows a positive effect during active growth phase (up to 4.5 months of age), which became insignificant in the later period of life.
TI  - A mixed-bacteria ecological approach to understanding the role of the oral bacteria in dental caries causation: an alternative to Streptococcus mutans and the specific-plaque hypothesis.
AB  - For more than 100 years, investigators have tried to identify the bacteria responsible for dental caries formation and to determine whether their role is one of specificity. Frequent association of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Streptococcus mutans with caries activity gave credence to their being specific cariogens. However, dental caries occurrence in their absence, and the presence of other bacteria able to produce substantial amounts of acid from fermentable carbohydrate, provided arguments for non-specificity. In the 1940s, Stephan found that the mixed bacteria in dental plaque produced a rapid drop in pH following a sugar rinse and a slow pH return toward baseline. This response became a cornerstone of plaque and mixed-bacterial involvement in dental caries causation when Stephan showed that the pH decrease was inversely and clearly related to caries activity. Detailed examination of the pH (acid-base) metabolisms of oral pure cultures, dental plaque, and salivary sediment identified the main bacteria and metabolic processes responsible for the pH metabolism of dental plaque. It was discovered that this metabolism in different individuals, in plaque in different dentition locations within individuals, and in individuals of different levels of caries activity could be described in terms of a relatively small number of acid-base metabolic processes. This led to an overall bacterial metabolic vector concept for dental plaque, and helped unravel the bacterial involvement in the degradation of the carbohydrate and nitrogenous substrates that produce the acids and alkali that affect the pH and favor and inhibit dental caries production, respectively. A central role of oral arginolytic and non-arginolytic acidogens in the production of the Stephan pH curve was discovered. The non-arginolytics could produce only the pH fall part of this curve, whereas the arginolytics could produce both the fall and the rise. The net result of the latter was a less acidic Stephan pH curve. Both kinds of bacteria are numerous in dental plaque. By varying their ratios, we were easily able to produce Stephan pH curves indicative of different levels of caries activity. This and substantial related metabolic and microbial data indicated that it is the proportions and numbers of acid-base-producing bacteria that are at the core of dental caries activity. The elimination of S. mutans, as with a vaccine, was considered to have little chance of success in preventing dental caries in humans, since, in most cases, this would simply make more room for one or more of the many acidogens remaining. An understanding of mixed-bacterial metabolism, knowledge of how to manipulate and work with mixed bacteria, and the use of a bacterial metabolic vector approach as described in this article have led to (1) a more ecological focus for dealing with dental caries, and (2) new means of developing and evaluating anti-caries agents directed toward microbial mixtures that counter excess acid accumulation and tooth demineralization.
TI  - Species-specific identification of commercial probiotic strains.
AB  - Products containing probiotic bacteria are gaining popularity, increasing the importance of their accurate speciation. Unfortunately, studies have suggested that improper labeling of probiotic species is common in commercial products. Species identification of a bank of commercial probiotic strains was attempted using partial 16S rDNA sequencing, carbohydrate fermentation analysis, and cellular fatty acid methyl ester analysis. Results from partial 16S rDNA sequencing indicated discrepancies between species designations for 26 out of 58 strains tested, including two ATCC Lactobacillus strains. When considering only the commercial strains obtained directly from the manufacturers, 14 of 29 strains carried species designations different from those obtained by partial 16S rDNA sequencing. Strains from six commercial products were species not listed on the label. The discrepancies mainly occurred in Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei groups. Carbohydrate fermentation analysis was not sensitive enough to identify species within the L. acidophilus group. Fatty acid methyl ester analysis was found to be variable and inaccurate and is not recommended to identify probiotic lactobacilli.
TI  - Influence of a Spirulina platensis biomass on the microflora of fermented ABT milks during storage (R1).
AB  - The objective of this research was to investigate the effect of a cyanobacterial  (Spirulina platensis) biomass on the microflora of a probiotic fermented dairy product during storage at two temperatures. Spirulina-enriched and control (plain) fermented acidophilus-bifidus-thermophilus (ABT) milks were produced using a fast fermentation starter culture (ABT-4) as the source of Lactobacillus acidophilus (A), bifidobacteria (B), and Streptococcus thermophilus (T). Incubation took 6 h at 40 degrees C. As for the cyanobacterial product, the S. platensis biomass was added to the process milk during stirring at pH 4.5 to 4.6. Thereafter, the ABT-type fermented milks were cooled to 25 degrees C in ice water, filled into sterile, tightly capped centrifuge tubes, further cooled at 4 degrees C for 24 h, and then stored either at 15 degrees C for 18 d or at 4 degrees C for 42 d. Microbiological analyses and acidity measurements were performed at regular intervals. Our results showed that the counts of the starter organisms were satisfactory during the entire storage period at both temperatures applied in this research. The S. platensis biomass had a beneficial effect on the survival of ABT starter bacteria regardless of storage temperature. Postacidification was observed at 15 degrees C, whereas pH remained stable during refrigerated storage at 4 degrees C. The abundance of bioactive substances in S. platensis is of great importance from a nutritional point of view because thus the cyanobacterial biomass provides a new opportunity for the manufacture of functional dairy foods.
TI  - Identification of Lactobacillus crispatus by polymerase chain reaction targeting  S-layer protein gene.
AB  - AIMS: This study aimed to develop a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method to identify Lactobacillus crispatus. METHODS AND RESULTS: A primer set (CbsA2F-CbsA2R) for amplifying conserved regions of S-layer genes was designed to identify Lact. crispatus and the specificity of this set was compared with that of another primer set (Cri 16SI-Cri 16SII) which has been reported as a species-specific primer set targeting the 16S rRNA gene. Among species in the Lact. acidophilus A1-A4 groups, when KOD polymerase was used for amplification, the primer set CbsA2F-CbsA2R gave PCR products with Lact. crispatus strains only. However, when Taq polymerase was used, this primer set gave products with one Lact. amylovorus strain as well as with Lact. crispatus strains. The primer set Cri 16SI-Cri 16SII gave PCR products with Lact. crispatus strains and two Lact. acidophilus strains, regardless of whether the polymerase used was KOD or Taq. CONCLUSIONS: A PCR targeting the S-layer gene and amplified with KOD polymerase can identify Lact. crispatus accurately and rapidly. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper to provide a PCR method for the specific identification of Lact. crispatus.
TI  - A novel immunostimulating aspect of Lactobacillus gasseri: induction of "Gasserokine" as chemoattractants for macrophages.
AB  - The chemotactic activity of the culture supernatants from 14 strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. gasseri was examined for murine macrophages. Significant macrophage chemotactic activity was observed in three strains of L. acidophilus and all strains of L. gasseri. The highest activity was observed in the supernatant (1131-sup) from 24-h cultures of L. gasseri JCM1131T. The chemotactic factor from 1131-sup, designated as "Gasserokine", was purified by the C18 reverse phase and ion-exchange chromatography. The purity of Gasserokine was checked by HPLC with the reverse-phase mode. The chemotactic activity of Gasserokine was also observed for human monocytes. The macrophage chemotaxis induced by L. gasseri JCM1131T culture supernatants was discovered to be a new biological function exerted by probiotic lactic acid bacteria. Therefore, the activity is expected to be used for one of the functional parameters in the immunomodulating properties of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Safety and efficacy of probiotic lactobacilli in promoting growth in post-weaning Swiss mice.
AB  - Lactobacillus rhamnosus MA27/6B and L. acidophilus MA27/6R are strains used in feed as probiotics. Their safety profiles and growth-stimulating properties were investigated via in vivo studies on young Swiss mice. After repeated administrations of different probiotic preparations in drinking water, safety parameters determined from liver, spleen and total weight remained unchanged. The growth-stimulating properties of viable or dead lactobacilli were studied after supplementation in drinking water. The feed intake (FI), water intake and body weight gain (WG) of the animals were compared to those of control mice. The lactobacilli supplementation of a sub-optimal diet made of barley allow recording of measurable growth performance of mice. It significantly increased WG compared to control groups (P < 0.01), by +28.9% and +31.7% for L. rhamnosus MA27/6B and L. acidophilus MA27/6R, respectively. This WG was correlated with a decrease in the consumption index. The effect of the dose ingested was also investigated: 10(8) lactobacilli CFU/mouse/day produced greater WG than 10(2), 10(4) or 10(6) CFU/mouse/day. No significant differences in growth performance parameters were observed between mice fed with 10(8) cells of viable or nonviable preparations. The mouse assay described could be used as a preliminary criterion when screening candidate probiotics for growth performance properties.
TI  - Effect of fluoride on cariogenic oral microorganisms (an in vitro study).
AB  - The effect of sodium fluoride and sodium monofluorophosphate at concentrations of 1, 5, 10, 50, 100 and 1000 mg/l in phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) as well as in UHT milk were studied on cultures and suspensions of Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Candida albicans. Using serial tenfold dilutions up to 10(-7) of 24-48 hour cultures, a subsequent 0, 60 and 120 min incubation caused no decrease in the number of CFUs. Growth kinetic studies in the Bioscreen biophotometer (Labsystem, Finland) revealed that sodium fluoride in different concentrations (from 0.875 mg/l up to 500 mg/l) influenced the growth dynamics of S. mutans and C. albicans: the exponential phase flattened out at the highest fluoride concentrations (500 mg/l) present in the growth media. The lag phase of C. albicans became longer. The results of these experiments indicate that sodium fluoride administered at higher concentrations than the usual caries preventive dosage made the generation time of cariogenic oral bacteria and fungi longer, slowing down their multiplication.
TI  - Salivary microbiota levels in relation to periodontal status, experience of caries and miswak use in Sudanese adults.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult Sudanese subjects. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. The periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. Whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method using whole genomic DNA probes. RESULTS: A high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or = 105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. Between 12% and 16% of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, C. rectus and E. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum, respectively. There were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. Presence of > or = 105 L. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). There were significantly higher levels of A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. melaninogenica, C. rectus, P. micros, V. parvula, S. mutans, S. anginosus, A. israelii, C. sputigena, and C. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, S. sputigena, E. corrodens, L. acidophilus, S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. oralis, and S. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. CONCLUSIONS: : The findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. This is the first report that the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.
TI  - Bacterial and fungal microleakage of AH26 and AH Plus root canal sealers.
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the penetration of Candida albicans alone and a combination of bacteria through root canals filled with gutta-percha and one or other root canal sealers, AH26 and AH Plus. METHODOLOGY: Eighty teeth were randomly divided into two groups of 40 teeth each and obturated with gutta-percha using either AH26 or AH Plus sealer. A further 10 teeth served as negative controls and 10 as positive controls. The external surface of each root, except the apical 2 mm, was covered with two layers of nail varnish. The teeth were inserted into Eppendorf plastic tubes and suspended in glass bottles containing sterile Schaedler broth. Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Prevotella melaninogenica and Lactobacillus acidophilus were placed in the access cavities of 20 teeth filled with AH26 and 20 with AH Plus. Candida albicans was placed in the access cavities of the other teeth. The culture medium with microorganisms was changed every 7 days. Every 72 h bacterial or fungal growth in the broth was tested up to a period of 90 days. RESULTS: Leakage in the experimental teeth occurred between 14 and 87 days. Leakage was present in 47% of all samples. From the samples with AH26, 45% leaked bacteria and 60% leaked fungi; whilst from the samples with AH Plus, 50% leaked bacteria and 55% fungi. There was no statistically significant difference in penetration of bacteria and fungi between the sealers. CONCLUSION: In this in vitro study, gutta-percha and the sealers AH26 and AH Plus allowed leakage of bacteria and fungi.
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis induces inflammatory bowel disease in interleukin-10 knockout mice.
AB  - Germ-free interleukin-10 knockout (IL-10 KO) mice developed inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) after they were colonized with a pure culture of Enterococcus faecalis. E. faecalis not only induced IBD (primarily in colon and rectum) but rectal dysplasia and adenocarcinoma was also found in the IL-10 KO mice. Conventional (complex-intestinal flora) IL-10 KO mice developed IBD within 10 to 15 weeks of age and showed more pathology in the cecum (typhlitis) than we observed with E. faecalis-induced IBD in gnotobiotic IL-10 KO mice. Conversely, neither germ-free IL-10 mice nor IL-10 KO mice colonized as adults, with a pure culture of Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus casei, L. reuteri, L. acidophilus, a Bifidobacterium sp., Lactococcus lactis, or a Bacillus sp. developed IBD during the 25- to 30-week study. E. faecalis is a common intestinal microbe of man and animals that can trigger IBD, dysplasia, and carcinoma in a genetically susceptible murine host.
TI  - Evolution of carbohydrate fraction in carbonated fermented milks as affected by beta-galactosidase activity of starter strains.
AB  - The influence of carbonation on the evolution of lactose, galactose and glucose in fermented milks with added probiotic bacteria (Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus and/or Bifidobacterium bifidum) was evaluated and related to beta-galactosidase activity of starter strains. During incubation and first days of refrigeration, lactose hydrolysis resulting in the liberation of galactose and glucose occurred in CT (Streptococcus thermophilus/Lb. casei), AT (Str. thermophilus/Lb. acidophilus) and ABT fermented milks (Str. thermophilus/Lb. acidophilus/Bifid. bifidum). Levels of galactose were higher than those of glucose and could be related to the preferential consumption of glucose by actively growing bacteria. Through the incubation, lactose and monosaccharide levels were not affected by milk carbonation. However, during refrigerated storage the presence of this gas was associated with slightly lower content of lactose and higher levels of galactose and glucose in AT and ABT products but not in CT fermented milks. Through the refrigeration galactose was moderately utilised by Lb. acidophilus in AT products whereas the presence of Bifid. bifidum seems to prevent the consumption of this sugar in ABT fermented milks. Glucose remained constant, with minor variations in CT products but a continuous increase of this sugar occurred in carbonated AT and ABT fermented milks during storage. Beta-galactosidase activity displayed by Str. thermophilus strains was similar at pH 6.5 (initial pH of non-carbonated samples) and pH 6.3 (initial pH of carbonated samples) whereas Lb. acidophilus LaA3 showed greater beta-galactosidase activity at pH 6.3 than at higher pH values. Thus, the enhanced metabolic activity of Lb. acidophilus caused by the low initial pH of carbonated milk also promoted higher cellular beta-galactosidase activity that could have released greater amounts of galactose and glucose from lactose in AT and ABT fermented milks through the refrigerated period. In CT fermented milks, similar beta-galactosidase activity levels of Str. thermophilus at pH 6.5 and 6.3 together with the absence of beta-galactosidase activity in Lb. casei could explain the lack of differences on glucose and galactose content between carbonated and non-carbonated samples.
TI  - The survival and persistence of Lactobacillus acidophilus LF221 in different ecosystems.
AB  - Being a human isolate and bacterocin producer with wide antimicrobial spectrum, Lactobacillus acidophilus LF221 fulfills preliminary conditions as a potential probiotic strain. To investigate the LF221 strain with respect to its persistence in complex ecosystems, viable LF221 cells were orally administered to laboratory animals (mice and piglets) and added to cheese milk. During the 10-day feeding of mice with LF221 viable cells, 0.9% of lactobacilli isolated from faeces were identical with LF221 strain. Within the piglets' feeding trial, 920 lactobacilli colonies randomly selected from faecal samples were screened for the presence of LF221-like colonies. During the six times of sampling of piglets' faeces, LF221 colonies were always detected. Even the final sampling 10 days after the last LF221 cell suspension was dosed into piglets revealed the presence of LF221 strain at a concentration of about 3 x 10(8) cells/g of faeces. LF221 intake did not significantly influence the total count of lactobacilli in faecal samples and it had no negative health effects on animals. Analyses of cheese demonstrated that the LF221 strain maintained a high viability during ripening and that it could be detected for at least 6 weeks at a level of about 6.8 x 10(6) cells/g of cheese. According to these results, semihard cheese represents a suitable medium for introducing a potential probiotic LF221 into a diet.
TI  - Application of nontraditional meat starter cultures in production of Hungarian salami.
AB  - Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli O111 have been implicated in several  outbreaks of food-borne disease linked to smallgoods products. Traditional meat starter cultures, containing a mixture of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and staphylococci, are used to maintain safety and sensory properties of Hungarian salami. The present study investigated if nontraditional meat starter (NTMS) cultures can be used for improving the safety of Hungarian salami. Salami batter was inoculated with List. monocytogenes and E. coli and subsequently fermented with NTMS cultures and a commercially available meat starter. A total of 15 NTMS cultures were tested. The salami was monitored for levels of pathogen, LAB and pH. When used in conjunction with the commercial meat starter, 9 NTMS cultures reduced the E. coli O111 count by more than 2.5 log units, whereas 10 of the NTMS cultures reduced List. monocytogenes by more than 2.5 log units. The commercial meat starter alone reduced E. coli and List. monocytogenes by 1.2 and 1.3 log units, respectively. Some NTMS cultures reduced the pathogen count without affecting pH of the salami batter. All NTMS cultures survived in salami throughout fermentation and maturation. It was concluded that NTMS cultures, including Lactobacillus acidophilus LAFTI L10, L. paracasei LAFTI L26, L. paracasei 5119, Lactobacillus sp. L24 and Bifidobacterium lactis LAFTI B94, may be used to increase the safety of Hungarian salami because these cultures gave strong inhibition of both E. coli O111 and List. monocytogenes.
TI  - Effect of Lactobacillus strains (L. casei and L. Acidophillus Strains cerela) on  bacterial overgrowth-related chronic diarrhea.
AB  - Small bowel bacterial overgrowth and related diarrhea is a condition that frequently accompanies anatomic disorders, surgically created blind loops or strictures with partial small bowel obstruction and although it is often controlled with antimicrobial therapy, alternative treatment may be needed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of an oral probiotic preparation of 2 viable lyophilized strains of lactobacilli (1.5 g each) compared with placebo. Twenty two patients with proven overgrowth and chronic diarrhea are described. In random order and double-blind fashion, 2 groups of patients received identical capsules with both Lactobacillus casei and L. acidophillus strains CERELA (12 patients) (LC) and placebo (10 patients) (P) during three consecutive periods of 7 days each followed by a similar three periods of control after withdrawal. At the end of each period the mean daily number of stools, glucose breath H2 test, and symptoms were considered. Lactobacillus were investigated in feces in both groups at day 0 (baseline), on day 21 of treatment with LC and P and on day 21 after withdrawal. Compared with P a significant reduction in mean daily number of stools was achieved with LC (p < 0.005) at 15 days, and (p < 0.0005) at 21 days and the effect was sustained at 7 days and 15 days (p < 0.005) after withdrawal. With respect to breath H2 level a significant decrease in H2 concentration was noted at 7 days (p < 0.005) at 15 days, and 21 days (p < 0.0001) with LC and only a significant decrease (p < 0.005) was observed at 7 days after withdrawal. No significant changes were observed with respect to symptoms. The Lactobacillus CERELA strains were isolated from the feces in all patients LC (n = 12) on day 21, and by contrast no Lactobacillus were observed except in two patients out of seven patients after withdrawal. In summary, this study provides evidence that LC are effective for treatment of bacterial overgrowth--related chronic diarrhea, and suggest that probiotics must be used with continuity.
TI  - Identification of Lactobacillus species using tDNA-PCR.
AB  - tDNA intergenic spacer PCR (tDNA-PCR) using consensus primers complementary to the conserved edges of the tRNA genes can amplify the intergenic spacers. Separation of the PCR products with capillary electrophoresis enables discrimination between fragments differing only one basepair in length. This method was applied to a collection of 82 Lactobacillus strains belonging to 37 species in order to evaluate the discriminatory power of this technique within this genus. Twenty-one species could be distinguished to species level on the basis of a unique tDNA fingerprint pattern. The other species grouped by two (e.g. L. fermentum and L. cellobiosus) or three (L. acidophilus, L. gallinarum and L. helveticus). Inclusion of the resulting fingerprints in a numerical database containing fingerprints of numerous other Gram-positive and Gram-negative species makes the identification of unknown strains possible.
TI  - Comparison of bacterial and tissue cell initial adhesion on hydrophilic/hydrophobic biomaterials.
AB  - In this study, interactions of widely-used polymeric biomaterials, i.e. poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) and its copolymer with dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (PHEMA-20% DMAEMA), polyurethane (PU), polypropylene (PP), poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), and poly(lactide-glycolide) (PLGA), with three pathogenic bacteria and one nonpathogen were investigated comparatively with the adhesion of two tissue cells in different morphologies, i.e. fibroblast-like baby hamster kidney (BHK 21) cells and epithelial Madine Darby kidney (MDBK) cells. Biomaterials were prepared in the membrane form by bulk polymerization or solvent casting. Surface characterization studies showed that these polymers have different surface free energies in the range of 26.9-63.1 erg cm(-2) and they have smooth surfaces. The bacteria used were; Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Staphylococcus aureus, and Lactobacillus acidophilus B-13. Initial adhesion of bacteria to the polymeric surfaces was examined under static conditions and in a laminar flow cell. The adhesion behaviour of S. aureus and S. epidermidis was found independent of the polymeric surface hydrophobicity. However, the percentage of attached E. coli decreased when increasing the surface free energy of the polymer, while L. acidophilus showed just the opposite behaviour. The comparative results indicated that the adhesion of BHK and MDBK cell was lowest on the most hydrophilic PHEMA surface and highest on the most hydrophobic PP surface. In contrast to the case of bacterial adhesion, no relationship was found between polymer hydrophobicity and mammalian cell adherence.
TI  - Interactions among lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria used for fermented  dairy products.
AB  - Interactions among lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria were investigated to establish adequate combinations of strains to manufacture probiotic dairy products. For this aim, a total of 48 strains of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Bifidobacterium spp. (eight of each) were used. The detection of bacterial interactions was carried out using the well-diffusion agar assay, and the interactions found were further characterized by growth kinetics. A variety of interactions was demonstrated. Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was found to be able to inhibit S. thermophilus strains. Among probiotic cultures, Lb. acidophilus was the sole species that was inhibited by the others (Lb. casei and Bifidobacterium). In general, probiotic bacteria proved to be more inhibitory towards lactic acid bacteria than vice versa since the latter did not exert any effect on the growth of the former, with some exceptions. The study of interactions by growth kinetics allowed the setting of four different kinds of behaviors between species of lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria (stimulation, delay, complete inhibition of growth, and no effects among them). The possible interactions among the strains selected to manufacture a probiotic fermented dairy product should be taken into account when choosing the best combination/s to optimize their performance in the process and their survival in the products during cold storage.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus (strain LB) from the resident adult human gastrointestinal microflora exerts activity against brush border damage promoted by a diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli in human enterocyte-like cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The normal gastrointestinal microflora exerts a barrier effect against enteropathogens. The aim of this study was to examine whether lactobacilli, a minor genus of the resident gut microflora, exerts a protective effect against the cellular injuries promoted by the diarrhoeagenic Afa/Dr diffusely adhering Escherichia coli (Afa/Dr DAEC) C1845 strain in human intestinal cells. METHODS: Cultured human intestinal fully differentiated enterocyte-like Caco-2/TC7 cells were used. Antibacterial activity was examined by measuring the viability of the adhering C1845 bacteria. The distribution of brush border associated cytoskeleton and functional proteins was examined by immunofluorescence labelling coupled to confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis. RESULTS: The activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LB isolated from the resident human gastrointestinal microflora was examined. A dose dependent decrease in viability of C1845 bacteria was observed after both direct contact in vitro between the spent culture supernatant (LB-SCS) and the bacteria, and when the bacteria were adherent on Caco-2/TC7 cells. Protection against the C1845 induced alterations in expression of F-actin, sucrase-isomaltase, dipeptidylpeptidase IV, alkaline phosphatase, and fructose transporter alterations was observed when the cells were exposed to LB-SCS. CONCLUSION: L acidophilus strain isolated from the resident adult human gastrointestinal microflora, together with its antimicrobial activity, exerts a protective effect against the brush border lesions promoted by the diarrhoeagenic Afa/Dr DAEC strain C1845.
TI  - Specific IgA response, T-cell subtype and cytokine profile in experimental intravaginal trichomoniasis.
AB  - Trichomoniasis caused by Trichomonas vaginalis may lead to either a complete absence of symptoms or to severe inflammatory manifestations in infected women. Studies of the role of immune responses in the pathogenesis and varied symptomatology of this disease are lacking. Mice may prove useful as an experimental model for intravaginal trichomoniasis in developing an understanding of the role of local immune responses in the pathogenesis and varied symptomatology of this disease. The present study reports the levels of anti-Trichomonas IgA antibodies in serum and vaginal washes, and T-cell subtype and cytokine profile in vaginal cervical tissues of mice infected intravaginally with T. vaginalis isolates from 15 symptomatic and 15 asymptomatic women. It also correlates the responses with symptomatology of the patients. Successful intravaginal infection was established by inoculating T. vaginalis in BALB/c mice preinoculated with Lactobacillus acidophilus and pretreated with oestradiol. A significant increase in specific IgA antibody levels was detected with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in vaginal secretions and serum samples collected on the 7th post-infection day from animals infected with isolates from asymptomatic women when compared with mice infected with isolates from symptomatic women. T-cell subset analysis showed significant differences, with increased CD4+ T-cell count in animals infected with isolates from asymptomatic women compared with animals infected using isolates from symptomatic women. No difference in CD8+ T cells was observed between the two groups. Cytokine profile revealed significantly higher (P < 0.001) production of gamma-IFN and IL-2 in mice infected with asymptomatic isolates compared with animals infected with symptomatic isolates, using T. vaginalis crude antigen extract and nonspecific mitogen (ConA) as stimulants for vaginal cervical lymphocytes. However, no difference in IL-4 levels was observed in the two groups of animals. In contrast, significant increase in tumour necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) levels was observed in animals infected with asymptomatic isolates compared with those infected with isolates from symptomatic women and controls, thereby indicating that TNF-alpha may play an important role in the inflammatory response to trichomoniasis. The study further suggests that specific IgA antibodies might help to protect asymptomatic individuals from severe infection and T-lymphocytes may play an important function in the eradication of the parasite. The cytokine profile indicated the involvement of Th-1 like responses in mice infected with asymptomatic isolates, compared with those infected with symptomatic isolates.
TI  - A comparison of five methods for extraction of bacterial DNA from human faecal samples.
AB  - The purity of DNA extracted from faecal samples is a key issue in the sensitivity and usefulness of biological analyses such as PCR for infectious pathogens and non-pathogens. We have compared the relative efficacy of extraction of bacterial DNA (both Gram negative and positive origin) from faeces using four commercial kits (FastDNA kit, Bio 101; Nucleospin C+T kit, Macherey-Nagal; Quantum Prep Aquapure Genomic DNA isolation kit, Bio-Rad; QIAamp DNA stool mini kit, Qiagen) and a non-commercial guanidium isothiocyanate/silica matrix method. Human faecal samples were spiked with additional known concentrations of Lactobacillus acidophilus or Bacteroides uniformis, the DNA was then extracted by each of the five methods, and tested in genus-specific PCRs. The Nucleospin method was the most sensitive procedure for the extraction of DNA from a pure bacterial culture of Gram-positive L. acidophilus (10(4) bacteria/PCR), and QIAamp and the guanidium method were most sensitive for cultures of Gram-negative B. uniformis (10(3) bacteria/PCR). However, for faecal samples, the QIAamp kit was the most effective extraction method and led to the detection of bacterial DNA over the greatest range of spike concentrations for both B. uniformis and L. acidophilus in primary PCR reactions. A difference in extraction efficacy was observed between faecal samples from different individuals. The use of appropriate DNA extraction kits or methods is critical for successful and valid PCR studies on clinical, experimental or environmental samples and we recommend that DNA extraction techniques are carefully selected with particular regard to the specimen type.
TI  - Immunological activity of larch arabinogalactan and Echinacea: a preliminary, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  - The immunomodulating effects of two Echinacea species, E. purpurea and E. angustifolia and larch arabinogalactan extracted from Larix occidentalis were examined in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective four-week clinical trial at a naturopathic medical school research center. SUBJECTS/MATERIALS: Forty-eight healthy female volunteers (22-51 y) were randomly assigned to one of six groups: standardized extract of E. purpurea (EP); ultra-refined E. purpurea/E. angustifolia (urEPA); E. purpurea/E. angustifolia (EPA); E. purpurea/E. angustifolia plus larch arabinogalactan (EPALA); larch arabinogalactan (LA); or placebo. METHODS: Immunological tests with enumerative measurements, stool cultures for Lactobacillus acidophilus and yeast, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) using the Medical Outcomes Study derived SF-36 self-administered questionnaire were assessed at baseline and at four weeks. RESULTS: Complement properdin increased by 21 percent in the EPA group (p<0.05) and by 18 percent in the EPALA group (p<0.05), compared to the placebo group (p>0.05). SF-36 showed improvements in overall physical health, vitality, and emotional health in the same two groups (EPA and EPALA). DISCUSSION: Volunteers in the EPA and EPALA groups had increased production of complement properdin after four weeks of intervention. The increased complement properdin may be an indication of one aspect of immune system stimulation in patients treated with either E. purpurea/E. angustifolia or E. purpurea/E. angustifolia plus larch arabinogalactan.
TI  - Use of fermented foods to combat stunting and failure to thrive.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: With the adoption of vigorous child survival strategies, infant and child mortalities in India have declined significantly, even among the poorest, most undernourished segments of the population. Of the surviving infants and children, however, many remain stunted and undernourished. The present study was based on the hypothesis that failure to thrive is the result of damage to the gut epithelium incurred during repeated bouts of gastrointestinal infections. Promoting the regeneration of the damaged gut epithelium through the use of lactobacillus-rich fermented foods may yield beneficial results. This low-cost procedure can be widely used, even in poor communities. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effect in poor Indian communities of supplementation with a probiotic on the growth of children (aged 2 to 5 years) with growth retardation and assess the difference in morbidity between those receiving the supplement (n = 50) and the control group (n = 50), mainly with respect to the frequency, severity, and duration of diarrheal episodes. METHODS: One hundred children aged 2 to 5 y from an urban slum of New Delhi were matched for their age (+/-36 d), sex and weight (+/-1 kg) and assigned to one of two groups (experimental n= 50 and control n= 50). The experimental group received a probiotic supplement (50 ml curd containing Lactobacillus acidophilus) and the control group received an isocaloric supplement daily for 6 mo. Weight, height, and morbidity profile with respect to diarrhea, fever, cough, and cold was recorded. RESULTS: Increases in weight (P < 0.002) and height (P < 0.001) were significantly greater in the experimental group than in the control group. In addition, after 6 mo, of supplementation, there were fewer cases of diarrhea (P < 0.005) and fever (P < 0.001) in the intervention group then in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: From this study, it can be concluded that 6 mo of probiotic supplementation may be beneficial with respect to decrease in diarrheal morbidity and accelerated growth in the experimental group.

TI  - Growth studies of potentially probiotic lactic acid bacteria in cereal-based substrates.
AB  - AIMS: The overall growth kinetics of four potentially probiotic strains (Lactobacillus fermentum, Lact. reuteri, Lact. acidophilus and Lact. plantarum) cultured in malt, barley and wheat media were investigated. The objectives were to identify the main factors influencing the growth and metabolic activity of each strain in association with the cereal substrate. METHODS AND RESULTS: All fermentations were performed without pH control. A logistic-type equation, which included a growth inhibition term, was used to describe the experimental data. In the malt medium, all strains attained high maximum cell populations (8.10-10.11 log10 cfu ml(-1), depending on the strain), probably due to the availability of maltose, sucrose, glucose, fructose (approx. 15 g l(-1) total fermentable sugars) and free amino nitrogen (approx. 80 mg l(-1)). The consumption of sugars during the exponential phase (10-12 h) resulted in the accumulation of lactic acid (1.06-1.99 g l(-1)) and acetic acid (0.29-0.59 g l(-1)), which progressively decreased the pH of the medium. Each strain demonstrated a specific preference for one or more sugars. Since small amounts of sugars were consumed by the end of the exponential phase (17-43%), the decisive growth-limiting factor was probably the pH, which at that time ranged between 3.40 and 3.77 for all of the strains. Analysis of the metabolic products confirmed the heterofermentative or homofermentative nature of the strains used, except in the case of Lact. acidophilus which demonstrated a shift towards the heterofermentative pathway. All strains produced acetic acid during the exponential phase, which could be attributed to the presence of oxygen. Lactobacillus plantarum, Lact. reuteri and Lact. fermentum continued to consume the remaining sugars and accumulate metabolic products in the medium, probably due to energy requirements for cell viability, while Lact. acidophilus entered directly into the decline phase. In the barley and wheat media all strains, especially Lact. acidophilus and Lact. reuteri, attained lower maximum cell populations (7.20-9.43 log10 cfu ml(-1)) than in the malt medium. This could be attributed to the low sugar content (3-4 g l(-1) total fermentable sugar for each medium) and the low free amino nitrogen concentration (15.3-26.6 mg l(-1)). In all fermentations, the microbial growth ceased at pH values (3.73-4.88, depending on the strain) lower than those observed for malt fermentations, which suggests that substrate deficiency in sugars and free amino nitrogen contributed to growth limitation. CONCLUSIONS: The malt medium supported the growth of all strains more than barley and wheat media due to its chemical composition, while Lact. plantarum and Lact. fermentum appeared to be less fastidious and more resistant to acidic conditions than Lact. acidophilus and Lact. reuteri. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Cereals are suitable substrates for the growth of potentially probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Microbial status and rumen enzyme profile of crossbred calves fed on different microbial feed additives.
AB  - AIMS: To test various microbial cultures as cattle feed additives. METHODS AND RESULTS: Four groups of newly born crossbred calves (average body weight 23.5 kg) were reared on green berseem and calf starter which was devoid of cereal grains. Milk was fed up to 8 weeks of age, starting with one tenths and gradually reducing to one twentieths of the body weight. One hundred millilitres of microbial feed additive or 100 g fermented feed was fed to the animals of group 2 (curd containing lactic acid bacteria at 10(8) cfu x ml(-1)), group 3 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae NCDC-49 at 10(6) cfu x ml(-1)) and group 4 (Lactobacillus acidophilus-15 at 10(8) cfu x ml(-1)). Group 1 served as control. The incidence and duration of diarrhoea was lower in the animals of probiotic fed groups as compared to control group. Out of three microbial feed additives, yeast feeding showed maximum suppression of diarrhoea followed by Lactobacillus and curd. CONCLUSIONS, SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: There was no effect of probiotic feeding on the log number of cells of lactic acid bacteria, yeast and coliform bacteria in the faeces and rumen liquor at any age. The activities of carboxymethylcellulase, xylanase, beta-glucosidase, alpha-glucosidase, alpha-amylase, protease, urease and pH of the rumen liquor remained unaffected by probiotic feeding at all ages tested in this experiment.
TI  - Lack of therapeutic effect of a specially designed yogurt for the eradication of  Helicobacter pylori infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current antibiotic treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection is often associated with frequent adverse effects and resistance to antibiotics. Alternative treatment methods to control H. pylori infection are needed. Some specific strains of lactic acid bacteria (probiotics) in dairy products are known to inhibit the growth of H. pylori in vitro. A clinical trial was conducted to see the efficacy of a specially designed yogurt product containing specific probiotics on the eradication of H. pylori. METHOD: The yogurt was prepared using three Lactobacillus spp. (L. acidophilus and L. casei) and one commercial starter culture (L. acidophilus, L. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus). All these cultures were previously evaluated, and found to have strong in vitro inhibitory effects on the growth of H. pylori. Twenty-seven asymptomatic women positive for H. pylori on gastric biopsy and 13C urea breath test were recruited, and administered 175 ml of the yogurt three times a day for 30 days. The 13C urea breath test was administered again, one month after stopping the yogurt treatment to detect the presence of H. pylori. RESULTS: In 26 of 27 subjects, the urea breath test values remained positive, indicating that the consumption of the yogurt had no effect on the eradication of H. pylori. CONCLUSION: Although the designed fermented milk containing lactobacilli is very effective in the inhibition of H. pylori growth in vitro, eradication of this infection in humans is difficult to achieve by consuming this product.
TI  - Enteroinvasive bacteria alter barrier and transport properties of human intestinal epithelium: role of iNOS and COX-2.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Various invasive pathogens cause diarrhea, but the mechanism(s) are poorly understood. We hypothesized that nitric oxide and prostaglandins might modulate chloride secretory and barrier properties of the infected intestinal epithelium and that diarrhea is caused, in part, by altered expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2). METHODS: Studies were conducted in human intestinal epithelial cell lines (HT29/cl.19A, Caco-2, and T84). Cells were infected with enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC 029:NM) or Salmonella dublin (SD), or nonpathogenic, noninvasive bacteria (Streptococcus thermophilus [ST] and Lactobacillus acidophilus [LA]). Infected cells and controls were tested for transepithelial resistance, chloride secretion, prostaglandin E2, guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate and adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, and protein expression. RESULTS: Cells infected with EIEC or SD, but not uninfected controls or ST/LA-exposed monolayers, showed a progressive reduction in transepithelial resistance starting at 6-12 hours. Infected HT29/cl.19A and Caco-2 cells, but not T84 cells, also showed an increase in total nitrite. Expression of iNOS, and consequently COX-2, was also increased, followed by increased production of prostaglandins and cyclic nucleotides. Furthermore, basal and stimulated chloride secretory responses to various agonists were enhanced in HT29/cl.19A and Caco-2 cells after infection with enteroinvasive bacteria, and this effect was reversed for some agonists by iNOS or COX-2 inhibitors. Increased expression of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and NKCC1 was also observed in EIEC or SD-infected cells vs. controls, secondary to NO synthase activity. CONCLUSIONS: Up-regulation of iNOS and COX-2 by enteroinvasive bacteria can modulate chloride secretion and barrier function in intestinal epithelial cells. Thus, these enzymes represent possible therapeutic targets in infectious diarrhea.
TI  - Selective responses of three Ginkgo biloba leaf-derived constituents on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The selective responses of Ginkgo biloba leaf-derived materials against six intestinal bacteria was examined using an impregnated paper disk method and compared with that of bilobalide, ginkgolides A and B, kaempferol, and quercetin. The components of G. biloba leaves were characterized as kaempferol 3-O-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside), kaempferol 3-O-(2' '-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside, and quercetin 3-O-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) by spectroscopic analysis. The growth responses varied with each bacterial strain tested. At 2 mg/disk, kaempferol 3-O-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) and quercetin 3-O-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) revealed potent inhibition against Clostridium perfringens, and kaempferol 3-O-(2' '-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside showed a clear inhibitory effect on Escherichia coli. At 0.5 mg/disk, quercetin 3-O-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) showed a strong activity against C. perfringens, but weak activity was exhibited by kaempferol 3-O-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) against C. perfringens and kaempferol 3-O-(2' '-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside against E. coli. No inhibition was observed from treatments conducted with bilobalide, ginkgolides A and B, kaempferol, or quercetin. Furthermore, these isolated compounds did not inhibit Bifidobacterium bifidum, B. longum, B. adolescentis, or Lactobacillus acidophilus.
TI  - Lipoteichoic acids from Lactobacillus johnsonii strain La1 and Lactobacillus acidophilus strain La10 antagonize the responsiveness of human intestinal epithelial HT29 cells to lipopolysaccharide and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) respond to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from gram-negative bacteria in the presence of the soluble form of CD14 (sCD14), a major endotoxin receptor. Since sCD14 is also known to interact with gram-positive bacteria and their components, we looked at whether sCD14 could mediate their effects on human IECs. To this end, we examined the production of proinflammatory cytokines following exposure of the IECs to specific gram-positive bacteria or their lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) in the absence and presence of human milk as a source of sCD14. In contrast to LPS from Escherichia coli or Salmonella enteritidis, neither the gram-positive bacteria Lactobacillus johnsonii strain La1 and Lactobacillus acidophilus strain La10 nor their LTAs stimulated IECs, even in the presence of sCD14. However, both LTAs inhibited the sCD14-mediated LPS responsiveness of IECs. We have previously hypothesized that sCD14 in human milk is a means by which the neonate gauges the bacterial load in the intestinal lumen and liberates protective proinflammatory cytokines from IECs. The present observations suggest that gram-positive organisms, via their LTAs, temper this response and prevent an exaggerated inflammatory response.
TI  - [Use of probiotics Bifidumbacterin and Acilact in tablets in therapy of periodontal inflammations].
AB  - The results of the use of russian probiotics Acilact and Bifidumbacterin in complex treatment of gingivitis and different degrees of parodontitis are presented. The treatment of the patients of control group was added by the italien drug Tantum Verde. The effect of Acilact and Bifidumbacterin to the normalisation of Mycroflora higher in comparison with Tantum-Verde, particulary in the cases of gingivitis and parodontitis superficialis.
TI  - Effect of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and inulin on the formation of aberrant crypt foci in rats.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our studies were aimed at investigating the effect of lactic acid producing bacteria (LAB) or inulin, a natural source of non-digestible oligosaccharides derived from chicory, on the induction by carcinogens of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in the colon, which are considered to be early precursor lesions of neoplasia. METHODS: Strains of Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus were administered to rats fed a purified high starch diet, under a variety of treatment protocols including daily gavage, via the drinking water and in the diet. The rats were treated with methyl-N-nitrosourea, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine, or azoxymethane (AOM) to induce ACF. RESULTS: In general, no consistent significant changes in ACF numbers were detected in these experiments. In one study, the basal diet of the rats was changed to one containing a higher level of fat (corn oil). Under these conditions, a significant decrease in AOM-induced colonic ACF was seen in rats given L. acidophilus or inulin. In a concurrent group of animals fed a low fat diet, no significant decrease in ACF was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the type of diet fed can influence the detection of protective effects of LAB and oligosaccharides and that against the background of a diet with a level of fat typical of a Western diet, evidence for a protective effect of L. acidophilus and inulin towards colon cancer was obtained
TI  - Cloning and expression analysis of the 28 kDa protein from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis ATCC 4797 hypothesized to influence lactacin B production.
AB  - AIMS: A cell wall-associated lactacin B inducer protein (IP) was purified from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis ATCC 4797 (Lact. lactis) by chromatofocusing and gel filtration HPLC (Barefoot et al. 1994). METHODS AND RESULTS: N-terminal sequence of the purified IP was used to design an oligonucleotide (24-mer) for gene identification by Southern and colony hybridizations. Southern hybridization on Lact. lactis chromosomal DNA digested with EcoRI and PstI produced a single 4-5 kbp DNA fragment. Colony hybridizations with 6250 clones produced four positive recombinants for the proposed IP. Sequence of the DNA isolated from RU43e9 revealed a 4623 bp DNA fragment containing three open reading frames (ORF) potentially encoding enzymes that function in glycolysis. One ORF, coding for an active triosephosphate isomerase (Tpi), showed 98% homology to the N-terminal domain of the HPLC purified IP. PCR primers were designed to amplify the ORF encoding the proposed IP for subcloning, protein expression, purification and bacteriocin enhancing assays on pure cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus N2. CONCLUSIONS: The regions flanking the Tpi gene (data not shown) were also sequenced and it is concluded that the proposed IP reported by Barefoot et al. (1994) is located on an operon containing several glycolytic enzymes that function in glycolysis. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The findings of this study do not support previously published research (Barefoot et al. 1994) hypothesizing that a purified IP from Lact. lactis, homologous to a Bacillus stearothermophilus Tpi, is capable of enhancing bacteriocin synthesis in Lact. acidophilus N2.
TI  - Identification of predominant human and animal anaerobic intestinal bacterial species by terminal restriction fragment patterns (TRFPs): a rapid, PCR-based method.
AB  - Identification of predominant human and animal intestinal tract anaerobes by conventional methods is cumbersome, time-consuming and less sensitive as compared to molecular methods. We have developed a molecular technique to identify most of the abundant intestinal microflora by polyermase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of a 16S rRNA gene fragment using a pair of universal PCR primers. The forward PCR primer was labelled with 6-carboxyfluorescein amino hexy (6-FAM) fluorescent dye to detect the terminal fragment of the PCR products after digestion with restriction enzymes. The PCR products were purified and digested with restriction enzymes and were analysed by capillary electrophoresis using an automated DNA sequencer. The data was analysed with GeneScan software 2.1. Eleven bacteria (Eubacterium biforme, E. limosum, Peptostreptococcus productus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus, B. distasonis, Clostridium clostridiiforme, C. leptum, C. perfringens and Escherichia coli) that are predominant in human and animal intestinal tract were successfully identified by this rapid molecular technique. This protocol is rapid, accurate, sensitive and capable of identifying multiple organisms in a single sample.
TI  - Effects of lactic acid bacteria on the uptake and distribution of the food mutagen Trp-P-2 in mice.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactic acid bacteria have been reported to have antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic properties in vivo and in vitro. Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium longum have earlier been shown to bind the food mutagen Trp-P-2 in vitro. METHODS: The influence of oral supplementation with L. acidophilus NCFB 1748 and B. longum BB 536 on the uptake and distribution of 14C-labelled Trp-P-2 in several mouse tissues was quantified by liquid scintillation measurements and examined by tape section autoradiography (gives an unbiased qualitative registration of differences in overall tissue distribution) in the present investigation. Furthermore, the effect of 13-naphthoflavone (BNF), a cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A)-inducing agent, on the distribution of 14C-labelled Trp-P-2 was examined. RESULTS: After oral (6 mg/kg; 5 microCi) or iv (1.2 mg/kg; 1 microCi) administration of 14C-labelled Trp-P-2, high levels of radioactivity were observed in the bile, urine and contents of the gastrointestinal tract. Lower levels were present in the liver, lung, kidney, intestines, brown fat, submaxillary salivary gland and thymus. In mice supplemented with lactic acid bacteria there was a significantly decreased level (29%-73%) of radioactivity in the lung, thymus, liver, kidney, submaxillary salivary gland and small intestine as compared with controls. In mice pretreated with BNF, a low but distinct localization of radioactivity in the lung was observed, whereas no similar localization occurred in controls. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that (i) there is a decreased bioavailability of the Trp-P-2 in the majority of the tissues examined in bacteria supplemented mice and (ii) there is a low but distinct CYP1A-dependent activation of Trp-P-2 in the lung of BNF-treated mice.
TI  - Characterisation of IS153, an IS3-family insertion sequence isolated from Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and its use for strain differentiation.
AB  - An insertion sequence has been identified in the genome of Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis DSM 20451T as segment of 1351 nucleotides containing 37-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats. The sequence of this element encodes two out of phase, overlapping open reading frames, orfA and orfB, from which three putative proteins are produced. OrfAB is a transframe protein produced by -1 translational frame shifting between orf A and orf B that is presumed to be the transposase. The large orfAB of this element encodes a 342 amino acid protein that displays similarities with transposases encoded by bacterial insertion sequences belonging to the IS3 family. In L. sanfranciscensis type strain DSM 20451T multiple truncated IS elements were identified. Inverse PCR was used to analyze target sites of four of these elements, but except of their highly AT rich character not any sequence specificity was identified so far. Moreover, no flanking direct repeats were identified. Multiple copies of IS153 were detected by hybridization in other strains of L. sanfranciscensis. Resulting hybridization patterns were shown to differentiate between organisms at strain level rather than a probe targeted against the 16S rDNA. With a PCR based approach IS153 or highly similar sequences were detected in L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. malefermentans, L. plantarum, L. hilgardii, L. collinoides L. farciminis L. sakei and L. salivarius, L. reuteri as well as in Enterococcus faecium, Pediococcus acidilactici and P. pentosaceus.
TI  - Adhesive property of Bifidobacterium lactis LKM512 and predominant bacteria of intestinal microflora to human intestinal mucin.
AB  - The adhesive property to the intestinal mucin of Bifidobacterium lactis LKM512, B. longum, B. breve, B. bifidum, B. adolescentis, B. infantis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteroides distasonis, Eubacterium aerofaciens, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, and Lactobacillus acidophilus were examined. Adhesive rate of LKM512 to the mucin was significantly (p < 0.05, 0.01, or 0.001) stronger than the other strains from 2 to 100 time. Though the adhesive property of many strains was almost same to the mucin of 20-year-old and 50-year-old generations, in case of 4-month-old was different. Adhesive inhibitory effect of C. perfringens to the mucin by LKM512 was examined. Under the condition that LKM512 was 108/ml and that C. perfringens was 106/ml, adhesion of C. perfringens to the mucin was inhibited at 99.6%, when LKM512 adhered in advance. There was the strong inhibition of adhesion at 74.0%, when C. perfringens adhered to mucin in advance. Thus, LKM512 can inhibit the adhesion of harmful bacteria to the intestinal mucin, the possibility of using as a probiotic strain has to be verified.

TI  - Lactobacilli express cell surface proteins which mediate binding of immobilized collagen and fibronectin.
AB  - Binding of immobilized collagen-I (Cn-I) and fibronectin (Fn) by Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 639 depends on cell-surface proteins. Capsule formation during the stationary growth phase has a negative effect on adherence of Cn-I and Fn. However, cells from the exponential growth phase, which produce no capsule, exhibit maximal binding. Binding is sensitive to trypsin, proteinase K, pronase E, and heat. Gelatin and soluble Cn-I partially inhibit binding of Cn-I although various proteins, sugars and amino acids do not affect binding to Fn. These results indicate that protein-protein interactions mediate adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses of surface proteins revealed that several proteins including the major 43-kDa protein of the S-layer are expressed. Monoclonal antibodies showed that Fn binds to a 15-kDa protein, while Cn-I binds to proteins of 45 and 58 kDa.
TI  - Evolution of the lactic acid bacterial community during malt whisky fermentation: a polyphasic study.
AB  - The development of the lactic acid bacterial community in a commercial malt whisky fermentation occurred in three broad phases. Initially, bacteria were inhibited by strong yeast growth. Fluorescence microscopy and environmental scanning electron microscopy revealed, in this early stage, both cocci and rods that were at least partly derived from the wort and yeast but also stemmed from the distillery plant. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of partial 16S rRNA genes and sequence analysis revealed cocci related to Streptococcus thermophilus or Saccharococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus brevis, and Lactobacillus fermentum. The middle phase began 35 to 40 h after yeast inoculation and was characterized by exponential growth of lactobacilli and residual yeast metabolism. Lactobacillus casei or Lactobacillus paracasei, L. fermentum, and Lactobacillus ferintoshensis were detected in samples of fermenting wort examined by DGGE during this stage. Bacterial growth was accompanied by the accumulation of acetic and lactic acids and the metabolism of residual maltooligosaccharides. By 70 h, two new PCR bands were detected on DGGE gels, and the associated bacteria were largely responsible for the final phase of the fermentation. The bacteria were phylogenetically related to Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii, and strains similar to the former had previously been recovered from malt whisky fermentations in Japan. These were probably obligately homofermentative bacteria, required malt wort for growth, and could not be cultured on normal laboratory media, such as MRS. Their metabolism during the last 20 to 30 h of fermentation was associated with yeast death and autolysis and further accumulation of lactate but no additional acetate.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of fifth-generation dentin bonding systems.
AB  - Past concepts that the pulp does not become infected until an actual carious exposure takes place have been challenged. The antibacterial effects of the dentin bonding systems Single Bond, Prime&Bond NT, and Excite were evaluated using the bacteria Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Streptococcus intermedius, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Prevotella oris, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella denticola, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, and Clostridium ramosum with a disk diffusion method. Chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as a positive control. After incubation zones of inhibited bacterial growth were measured. Prime&Bond NT showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. Lactobacillus acidophilus and Streptococcus mutans were remarkably resistant to Single Bond, whereas EX produced no inhibitory effect on Porphyromonas endodontalis, although the adhesive produced the maximum halo inhibition to Streptococcus mutans (15+/-1 mm), showing an antibacterial effect closest to chlorhexidine. The variety of results obtained in this study suggest that antibacterial properties of current dentin adhesives may depend on components that are originally incorporated to promote adhesion.
TI  - Gradient diffusion antibiotic susceptibility testing of potentially probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  - Minimum inhibitory contentrations (MICs) of selected inhibitors of cell wall synthesis (benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, and vancomycin), protein synthesis (gentamicin, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and erythromycin), and nucleic acid synthesis (co-trimoxazole, rifampicin, and metronidazole) were determined by gradient diffusion (E test; AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) on deMan, Rogosa, Sharpe (MRS) agar for Lactobacillus strain GG and 11 closely related, rapidly growing, facultatively anaerobic, potentially probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains. All strains were resistant to vancomycin (MIC90 > or = 256 microg/ml), co-trimoxazole (MIC90 > or = 32 microg/ml), metronidazole (MIC90 > or = 32 microg/ml), gentamicin (MIC90 > or = 128 microg/ml), and streptomycin (MIC90 > or = 256 microg/ml), and sensitive to pencillin G (MIC90 > 0.375 microg/ml), ampicillin (MIC90 > 0.750 microg/ml), rifampicin (MIC90 > 0.375 microg/ml), tetracycline (MIC90 > 1.5 microg/ml), chloramphenicol (MIC90 > 8 microg/ml), and erythromycin (MIC90 > 2 microg/ml). E test MICs were also determined for L. acidophilus National Collection of Food Bacteria (NCFB) 1748 and L. reuteri Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen 20016T by the inoculum application method recommended by the manufacturer (swabbing), with and without antibiotic prediffusion for 1 h at room temperature, and by an alternative inoculum application (agar overlay) method, without antibiotic prediffusion. Antibiotic prediffusion increased the MICs for penicillin G, ampicillin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol by up to 2 log2 MIC dilutions without changing antibiotic susceptibility category. Agar overlay application also increased the MICs for these antibiotics as well as for gentamicin by up to 3 log2 MIC dilutions without changing antibiotic susceptibility category. Exact agreement between MICs determined by swab and agar overlay application without antibiotic prediffusion was strain dependent: 54.5% for strain DSM 20016T and 72.7% for strain NCFB 1748. The swab and agar overlay gradient diffusion methods provide a reliable basis for antibiotic susceptibility testing of rapidly growing, facultatively anaerobic lactobacilli, using MRS agar as test medium and are readily applicable for testing individual isolates as needed.
TI  - Effects of different probiotic strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium on bacterial translocation and liver injury in an acute liver injury model.
AB  - Septic complications represent frequent causes of morbidity in liver diseases and following hepatic operations. Most infections are caused by the individual own intestinal microflora. The intestinal microflora composition is important in physiological and pathophysiological processes in the human gastrointestinal tract, but their influence on liver in different situations is unclear. We therefore studied the effect of different Lactobacillus strains and a Bifidobacterium strain on the extent of liver injury, bacterial translocation and intestinal microflora in an acute liver injury model. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups: acute liver injury control, acute liver injury + B. animalis NM2, acute liver injury + L. acidophilus NMI, acute liver injury + L. rhamnosus ATCC 53103, and acute liver injury + L. rhamnosus DSM 6594 and L. plantarum DSM 9843. The bacteria were administered rectally daily for 8 days. Liver injury was induced on the 8th day by intraperitoneal injection of D-galactosamine (1.1 g/kg BW). Samples were collected 24 h after the liver injury. Liver enzymes and bilirubin serum levels, bacterial translocation (to arterial and portal blood, liver and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs)), and intestinal microflora were evaluated. L. acidophilus NM1; L. rhamnosus ATCC 53103, and L. rhamnosus DSM 6594 + L. plantarum DSM 9843 decreased bacterial translocation compared to the liver injury control group. B. animalis NM2 increased bacterial translocation to the mesenteric lymph nodes. The levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) were significantly lower in the L. acidophilus, L. rhamnosus ATCC 53103, L. rhamnosus DSM 6594 + L. plantarum DSM 9843 groups compared to the liver injury group. The L. rhamnosus and L. rhamnosus + L. plantarum groups significantly reduced ALAT levels compared to the B. animalis group. All administered bacteria decreased the Enterobacteriaceae count in the cecum and colon. Administration of different lactobacilli and a Bifidobacterium strain in an acute liver injury rat model, has shown different effects on bacterial translocation and hepatocellular damage. L. acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, and L. rhamnosus + L. plantarum reduced bacterial translocation and hepatocellular damage. B. animalis NM2 increased bacterial translocation to the mesenteric lymph nodes and did not affect hepatocellular damage.
TI  - Characterisation and differentiation of lactobacilli by lectin typing.
AB  - Lactobacillus isolates from healthy Estonian and Swedish children were characterised by a lectin typing technique; 56 isolates from six species (L. acidophilus, L. paracasei, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. brevis and L. buchneri) were tested. The typing system was based on an agglutination assay with a panel of six commercially available lectins, which were chosen on the basis of their carbohydrate specificities. The isolates were also subjected to proteolytic degradation before lectin typing to decrease auto-agglutination of whole cells in the assay. The 56 isolates were divided into 15 different lectin types by their lectin agglutination patterns. Proteolytic treatment reduced auto-agglutination for the majority of species, apart from L. acidophilus, which remained predominantly auto-agglutinating (eight of nine strains). The system produced stable and reproducible results under standardised culture conditions. Lactobacilli are important bacteria for use as probiotics and this system may supplement current molecular typing techniques and may help in identification of strains that could be useful in this role.
TI  - [Characteristics of Lactobacillus strains contained in pharmaceuticals].
AB  - The aim of the study was to characterize lactic acid bacteria (LAB) which are components of drugs administered orally in cases of intestinal disturbances, or antibiotic--related diarrhea. Biochemical properties, growth behavior, bile tolerance, and survival at low pH of six LAB strains (four strains L. rhamnosus and two L. acidophilus) were studied. The survival at low pH was determined in MRS broth (Difco) acidified to pH 1; 2; 3; and 4. Bile tolerance was tested on MRS broth with 0.3% oxgall (Difco). Between tested strains differences in ability to grow at low pH and survival in bile were observed. Only 0.01% inoculum of all examined strains survived at pH 1. Differences between strains in survival at low pH (pH 2 and pH 3) and tolerance of bile were observed. However, after 2 h incubation at pH 4, 100% of strains stayed alive. Examined strains demonstrated good 3% bile tolerance. All strains met the criteria for probiotic strains: ability to survive at pH 3 and in the presence of bile.
TI  - Genes encoding bile salt hydrolases and conjugated bile salt transporters in Lactobacillus johnsonii 100-100 and other Lactobacillus species.
AB  - Lactobacillus johnsonii strain 100-100 expresses two antigenically distinct conjugated bile salt hydrolases (BSH), alpha and beta, that combine to form native homo- and heterotrimers. This paper reports characterization of loci within the genome that encode this capacity. A locus that encodes BSH beta (cbsH beta), a partial (cbsT1) and a complete conjugated bile salt transporter (cbsT2) was identified previously. DNA sequence analysis at this locus was extended and revealed a complete ORF for cbsT1 and no other ORFs in tandem. The three genes, cbsT1, cbsT2 and cbsH beta, probably constitute an operon; a putative promoter was identified upstream of cbsT1. A second locus that expresses BSH activity in strain 100-100 was identified. Sequence analysis of the clone predicted a 978 nt ORF that did not share tandem organization with other ORFs, was similar in sequence to other BSH genes, and matched, in predicted protein sequence, the first 25 amino acids of BSH alpha. A phenotypic screen for BSH activity and a genetic screen for the cbsH beta locus were performed on 50 Lactobacillus isolates from humans or dairy products. Nearly all of the isolates that were positive for cbsH beta were from human sources. Variability in the BSH phenotype and cbsH beta genotype was identified in isolates of the same species. DNA sequence was obtained and analysed from the cbsH beta locus of one human isolate, L. acidophilus strain KS-13. This organism has cbsT1, cbsT2 and cbs beta genes that are 84, 87 and 85% identical in DNA sequence to those of strain 100-100. DNA sequence identity to strain 100-100 ends in regions flanking this locus. The findings of this study suggest that BSH genes have been acquired horizontally and that BSH activity is important at some level for lactobacilli to colonize the lower gastrointestinal tract.
TI  - Oral bacterial therapy promotes recovery from acute diarrhea in children.
AB  - Lactobacilli in the intestines play an important role in developing natural defenses against both intestinal bacterial and viral infections. So a prospective clinical study was carried out at Cathay General Hospital to determine the effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium infantis on the course of acute diarrhea in hospitalized children. Altogether 100 children between 6 and 60 months of age were collected and randomly allocated into 2 groups. Study group (n = 50) was given Infloran Berna, which contains 10(9) viable Lactobacillus acidophilus and 10(9) Bifidobacterium infantis, one capsule tid for 4 days and control group (n = 50) received parenteral rehydration only without any medication. Only 20 stool cultures in study group had positive culture results for Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium. All children were evaluated for the degree of dehydration before rehydration. The clinical course of diarrhea was followed during the treatment period. Features on admission were similar between the study group and control group in age, duration of diarrhea at home, serum sodium & potassium and dehydration degree. The duration of diarrhea was defined as the time until the last appearance of watery stool. There was no difference between the study group and control group in the frequency of diarrhea stools on the day before admission (p > 0.05). However, the frequency of diarrhea for study group improved on the first and second day of hospitalization with statistical difference (p < 0.01). The duration of diarrhea during hospitalization in study group also decreased (3.1 vs. 3.6 days, p < 0.01). Oral bacterial therapy is an effective adjuvant therapy in rotavirus positive and negative children with diarrhea and can safely be administered during an episode of acute diarrhea.
TI  - Surface expression of the conserved C repeat region of streptococcal M6 protein within the Pip bacteriophage receptor of Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - The C repeat region of the M6 protein (M6c) from Streptococcus pyogenes was expressed within the Pip bacteriophage receptor on the surface of Lactococcus lactis. M6c was also detected in the culture medium. The pip-emm6c allele was integrated into the chromosome and stably expressed without antibiotic selection. The level of cell-associated surface expression of PipM6c was 0.015% of total cellular protein. The amount of PipM6c on the cell surface was increased about 17-fold by expressing pip-emm6c from a high-copy-number plasmid. Replacing the native pip promoter with stronger promoters isolated previously from Lactobacillus acidophilus increased surface expression of PipM6c from the high-copy-number plasmid up to 27-fold. Concomitantly, the amount of PipM6c in the medium increased 113-fold. The amount of PipM6c did not vary greatly between exponential- and stationary-phase cultures. Western blots indicated that the full-length PipM6c protein and most of the numerous proteolytic products were found only on the cell surface, whereas only one proteolytic fragment was found in the culture medium.
TI  - Bacteriocin susceptibility of Gardnerella vaginalis and its relationship to biotype, genotype, and metronidazole susceptibility.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to investigate the bacteriocin susceptibility of Gardnerella vaginalis and its relationship to biotype, genotype, and resistance to metronidazole. STUDY DESIGN: Bacteriocin susceptibility of 36 G vaginalis clinical isolates was tested against a vaginal strain of Lactobacillus acidophilus by a growth-inhibition method. The relationship to biotype, genotype, and resistance to metronidazole were analyzed by the chi2 test and Fisher exact test. RESULTS: Eight G vaginalis strains (22%) were bacteriocin-resistant. Biotypes 5 and 7 were found to be the most frequent among these resistant strains. Eight (42%) of the 19 isolates classified as biotype 5, 6, or 7 were bacteriocin-resistant compared with none of the isolates that were classified as other biotypes (P <.01). Biotype 5 was found in higher prevalence among the isolates resistant to bacteriocin (62%) than among the susceptible isolates (14%) (P =.01). Genotype B was found more frequently among the bacteriocin-resistant strains, but this finding was not statistically significant (P =.71). Seven (88%) bacteriocin-resistant strains were also resistant to metronidazole. CONCLUSION: An association between biotype and an increased resistance to bacteriocin was found. The ability of G vaginalis to resist the antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus bacteriocin may be a pivotal factor in understanding bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Anti-carcinogenicity of probiotics and prebiotics.
AB  - Yoghurt, and the lactic acid producing bacteria (LAB; probiotics) that it contains, have received much attention as potential cancer-preventing agents in the diet. It is usually considered that the mechanism of the action is by increasing the numbers of LAB in the colon, which modifies the ability of the microflora to produce carcinogens. Prebiotics such as non-digestible oligosaccharides (NDO) appear to have similar effects on the microflora by selectively stimulating the growth of LAB in the colon. Evidence for cancer-preventing properties of pro- and prebiotics is derived from studies on faecal enzyme activities in animals and humans, inhibition of genotoxicity of known carcinogens in vitro and In vivo, suppression of carcinogen-induced preneoplastic lesions and tumours in laboratory animals. Some of these studies indicate that combinations of pro and prebiotics ('synbiotics') are more effective. Epidemiological and intervention studies provide some, albelt limited, evidence for protective effects of products containing probiotics in humans.
TI  - Assessment of stress response of the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Different aspects of stress response of Lactobacillus acidophilus were investigated. First, the sublethal and lethal levels of bile, heat, and NaCl stresses were determined. They were 0.05% and 0.5% (bile), 53 degrees C and 60 degrees C (heat), and 2% and 18% (NaCl), respectively. To evaluate the effect of each stress at log phase, log-phase cultures were challenged directly with the lethal level of each stress (control) and were compared to log-phase cultures that were pre-exposed to the sublethal level prior to the exposure at the lethal level (test). Some, if not most, of the cells were killed in the control cultures against each of the three stresses. However, in the test cultures, the number of cells that had survived increased significantly. It appears that L. acidophilus is capable of displaying adaptive response to stress. The adaptive response to one stress was also shown to provide cross-protection against different stresses tested. The effect of each stress on stationary-phase cultures was also investigated. In contrast to log-phase culture, stationary-phase culture was inherently resistant to stress.
TI  - Preventive effects of Bifidobacterium- and Lactobacillus-fermented milk on the development of inflammatory bowel disease in senescence-accelerated mouse P1/Yit strain mice.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: We recently discovered inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the ileum and cecum of SAMP1/Yit strain mice under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions. To determine the effect of lactic acid bacteria (LAB - Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium bifidum and Lactobacillus acidophilus)-fermented milk on the prevention of IBD in SAMP1/Yit strain mice, we compared the disease severity on the intestinal inflammation among the group of mice fed saline, unfermented milk or LAB-fermented milk. METHODS: Three-week-old SAMP1/Yit strain mice (n = 72) were subdivided into three groups, that were fed saline, unfermented milk and LAB-fermented milk, respectively. The diets were orally administered daily via a gastric tube. When the mice reached 20 weeks of age, they were sacrificed and the IBD scores were compared among the three groups. RESULTS: Administration of the LAB-fermented milk to SAMP1/Yit strain mice reduced histological injury score, compared with those in saline-treated or unfermented milk-treated SAMP1/Yit strain mice. Ileal tissue weight and myeloperoxidase activity also reduced by treatment of LAB-fermented milk. Moreover, the tissue contents of immunoglobulins such as IgG1 and IgG2a were lower in the inflammatory regions in the SAMP1/Yit strain group fed LAB-fermented milk than that fed saline and unfermented milk. Cytokine-specific ELISA assays indicated the production of T-helper 1 cytokines such as interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the culture supernatants of MLN cells in the SAMP1/Yit strain group fed LAB-fermented milk was lower than those fed saline and unfermented milk. On the contrary, the production of interleukin-10 in MLN cells increased by prevention with LAB-fermented milk. CONCLUSION: LAB-fermented milk is beneficial for the treatment of murine IBD and this effect may be modulated through stabilization of the mucosal immunity by LAB.
TI  - Determination of cell viability in single or mixed samples using capillary electrophoresis laser-induced fluorescence microfluidic systems.
AB  - The advent of high-efficiency microbial separations will have a profound effect on both chemistry and microbiology. For the first time, it appears that it may be possible to obtain qualitative and quantitative information on microbial systems with the accuracy, precision, speed, and throughput that currently is found for chemical systems. Recently it was suggested that an analytical separations-based approach for determining the viability of cells would be advantageous. The feasibility of such an approach is demonstrated using CE-LIF of two bacteria and yeast. The analytical procedures and figures of merit are outlined. High-throughput analyses and evaluation of microorganisms now appear to be possible.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
AB  - Bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of Psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to China with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. In this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. The cell growth of Streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of S. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. The bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on S. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); pH, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). Bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including S. mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sobrinus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Actinomyces viscosus, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, with MICs ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. Furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of S. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of pH in the broth. Thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.
TI  - Selective growth inhibitor toward human intestinal bacteria derived from Pulsatilla cernua root.
AB  - Among 21 medicinal plants, the growth-inhibiting activity of Pulsatilla cernua root-derived materials toward human intestinal bacteria was examined by using an impregnated paper disk method. The biologically active components of P. cernua roots were characterized as 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid and 3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid by spectroscopic analysis. The activity was compared with that of six commercially available cinnamic acid derivatives trans-cinnamaldehyde, trans-cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, 2-methoxycinnamic acid, 3-methoxycinnamic acid, and 4-methoxycinnamic acid. The growth responses varied with each bacterial strain tested. Two isolated compounds revealed a potent inhibition against Clostridium perfringens, and moderate to weak activity against Escherichia coli was exhibited by 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid. Weak or no inhibitory activity was obtained against the bifidobacteria or Lactobacillus acidophilus. The inhibitory effect was much more pronounced in C. perfringens and E. coli as compared to B. adolescentis, B. bifidum, B. fragilis, B. longum, or L. acidophilus. Cinnamaldehyde exhibited a strong growth-inhibiting activity, but no inhibition was observed from treatments with trans-cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, 2-methoxycinnamic acid, 3-methoxycinnamic acid, and 4-methoxycinnamic acid. These results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of P. cernua root.
TI  - Biotherapeutic agents in the treatment of infectious diarrhea.
AB  - Biotherapeutic agents offer unique advantages over traditional treatments for infectious diarrhea, and several have been shown to be effective (Table 4). These therapeutic microbial agents are most effective in types of infectious diseases that are associated with a disruption of the normal intestinal microecology (e.g., AAD, C. difficile disease). The impact of biotherapeutic agents on rotaviral diarrhea is of special clinical importance because this is the most common cause of pediatric diarrhea, and there is no defined treatment. Strong efforts need to be made to limit antibiotic exposure in children. Biotherapeutic agents offer a safe and effective nonantibiotic method of treating this important pathogen, especially after the withdrawal of a rotaviral vaccine from the market by the FDA. However, for many biotherapeutic agents, well-done, placebo-controlled trials still are lacking, and not all types of infectious diarrhea respond to these agents. Continued research in this innovative therapeutic area is warranted.
TI  - Influence of anti-Helicobacter triple-therapy with metronidazole, omeprazole and  clarithromycin on intestinal microflora.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Proton pump inhibitor-based therapy including two antibiotics is the  treatment of choice for Helicobacter pylori infection. Oral antibiotic treatment can lead to intestinal overgrowth of potentially pathogenic bacteria. AIM: To investigate the intestinal microflora before and at different times after H. pylori treatment with omeprazole, clarithromycin and metronidazole. METHODS: Bacterial growth in faecal samples from 51 patients infected with H. pylori was determined qualitatively and quantitatively. During the same period of time, stool samples from 27 H. pylori-negative controls were taken and investigated at the same intervals. RESULTS: The microflora of H. pylori-infected patients was different from that in H. pylori negative controls. It was characterized by a high concentration of lactobacilli, mainly Lactobacillus acidophilus. Immediately after therapy there was an increased colonization with yeasts, while the growth of lactobacilli and other species was inhibited. Clostridium difficile was cultured from three cases, but without clinical manifestations of pseudomembranous colitis. After 4 weeks of therapy, the microflora returned to normal and was not different from that of the H. pylori-negative control group. CONCLUSIONS: In H. pylori-positive patients the intestinal flora is characterized by an increase in growth of acid-tolerant L. acidophilus. Eradication therapy exerts only a short-term influence on intestinal flora, whereas in the long term, the intestinal microflora is restored to a pattern similar to that of the control group.
TI  - [Intestinal dysbacteriosis in antibacterial therapy and perspectives in treatment by antibiotic-resistant probiotics].
AB  - Effect of different antibiotics and standard antibacterial therapy regimes on intestine microflora was investigated. Lincozamides demonstrated the most negative effect. Early addition of probiotics to the treatment with antibacterials had positive effect. Susceptibility of 21 strains of normal microflora to 25 antibiotics was tested. Resistance to antibiotics of lactobacilli varied significantly (more among strains and less among species). It was shown that L. acidophilus (probiotic "Acilact") was resistant to metronidazole only. High resistance to antibiotics was shown for L. plantarum 8RA3, L. fermentum 90T4C (components of probiotic "Lactobacterin"), L. fermentum BL96, L. acidophilus BL and L. acidophilus (component of "Linex"). Susceptibility of microorganisms in complex formulation "Linex" to the modern antibiotics was low. It is concluded that the use of stable antibiotic-resistant strains of normal microflora is favorable as addition to antibiotic therapy.
TI  - [Experimental evaluation of efficacy of Lactobacilli in prophylaxis and treatment of cholera].
AB  - Investigations on experimental models of cholera ("sealed" mice and suckling rabbits) demonstrated that previous daily oral administration of the ferment culture of Lactobacillus acidophilus BKM B-2020[symbol: see text] in a dose of 3.0 x 10(8) microbial cells/ml daily for 5-7 days prevented to the development of Vibrio cholerae infection. The curative effect observed after 3 administrations of lactobacilli within 48 hours after infection with V. cholerae was registered in 50% of cases. This strain of lactobacilli was found to be suitable for use as the basis component of probiotic, an additional remedy for the prophylaxis and treatment of cholera.
TI  - Inhibition of in vitro growth of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O157:H7 by probiotic Lactobacillus strains due to production of lactic acid.
AB  - The inhibiting characteristics of lactic acid bacteria on Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O157:H7 (three strains, clinically isolated) was investigated by using a batch fermentation system. The species such as Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota or L. acidophilus YIT 0070 exert growth inhibitory and bactericidal activities on STEC. The pH value and undissociated lactic acid (U-LA) concentration of the culture medium of STEC cocultured with L. casei or L. acidophilus dramatically lowered or increased, respectively [corrected], when compared with those of the control culture. The cytotoxic properties of U-LA on STEC strain 89020087 analyzed in vitro was divided into two phases, i.e., the bacteriostatic phase (between 3.2 to 62 mM) and the bactericidal phase (over 62 mM). These data suggest that the bactericidal effect of Lactobacillus on STEC depends on its lactic acid production and pH reductive effect.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus sepsis in a neonate.
AB  - Lactobacillus species are non-spore-forming, anaerobic, gram-positive rods that cause disease in immunocompromised adults. Few cases have been described in children. We present the case of a 2-month-old infant who apparently developed Lactobacillus acidophilus sepsis from an infected central venous catheter. Physicians should be aware that although Lactobacillus species rarely cause disease in children, they should be considered a possible pathogen when isolated from the blood of a newborn infant.
TI  - Reduction of oxaluria after an oral course of lactic acid bacteria at high concentration.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hyperoxaluria is a major risk factor for renal stones, and in most cases, it appears to be sustained by increased dietary load or increased intestinal absorption. Previous studies have shown that components of the endogenous digestive microflora, in particular Oxalobacter formigenes, utilize oxalate in the gut, thus limiting its absorption. We tested the hypothesis of whether oxaluria can be reduced by means of reducing intestinal absorption through feeding a mixture of freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria. METHODS: Six patients with idiopathic calcium-oxalate urolithiasis and mild hyperoxaluria (>40 mg/24 h) received daily a mixture containing 8 x 10(11) freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria (L. acidophilus, L. plantarum, L. brevis, S. thermophilus, B. infantis) for four weeks. The 24-hour urinary excretion of oxalate was determined at the end of the study period and then one month after ending the treatment. The ability of bacteria to degrade oxalate and grow in oxalate-containing media, and the gene expression of Ox1T, an enzyme that catalyzes the transmembrane exchange of oxalate, also were investigated. RESULTS: The treatment resulted in a great reduction of the 24-hour excretion of oxalate in all six patients enrolled. Mean levels +/- SD were 33.5 +/- 15.9 mg/24 h at the end of the study period and 28.3 +/- 14.6 mg/24 h one month after treatment was interrupted compared with baseline values of 55.5 +/- 19.6 mg/24 h (P < 0.05). The treatment was associated with a strong reduction of the fecal excretion of oxalate in the two patients tested. Two bacterial strains among those used for the treatment (L. acidophilus and S. thermophilus) proved in vitro to degrade oxalate effectively, but their growth was somewhat inhibited by oxalate. One strain (B. infantis) showed a quite good degrading activity and grew rapidly in the oxalate-containing medium. L. plantarum and L. brevis showed a modest ability to degrade oxalate even though they grew significantly in oxalate-containing medium. No strain expressed the Ox1T gene. CONCLUSIONS: The urinary excretion of oxalate, a major risk factor for renal stone formation and growth in patients with idiopathic calcium-oxalate urolithiasis, can be greatly reduced with treatment using a high concentration of freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria. We postulate that the biological manipulation of the endogenous digestive microflora can be a novel approach for the prevention of urinary stone formation.
TI  - Efficient system for directed integration into the Lactobacillus acidophilus and  Lactobacillus gasseri chromosomes via homologous recombination.
AB  - An efficient method is described for the generation of site-specific chromosomal  integrations in Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus gasseri. The strategy is an adaptation of the lactococcal pORI system (K. Leenhouts, G. Venema, and J. Kok, Methods Cell Sci. 20:35-50, 1998) and relies on the simultaneous use of two plasmids. The functionality of the integration strategy was demonstated by the insertional inactivation of the Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM lacL gene encoding beta-galactosidase and of the Lactobacillus gasseri ADH gusA gene encoding beta-glucuronidase.
TI  - In vitro adherence properties of Lactobacillus rhamnosus DR20 and Bifidobacterium lactis DR10 strains and their antagonistic activity against an enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli.
AB  - Adhesion and colonisation properties of three probiotic strains namely, Lactobacillus rhamnosus DR20, L. acidophilus HN017, and Bifidobacterium lactis DR10, were determined in vitro using the differentiated human intestinal cell-lines including HT-29, Caco-2, and HT29-MTX, and compared with properties of L. acidophilus LA-1 and L. rhamnosus GG (two commercial probiotic strains). Two independent methods were employed to quantitate the "adhesiveness" of each strain. In the first method, the bacteria adhered to human cells were detected by Gram staining and counted in different fields under a microscope. Bacteria were also radio-labelled and extent of adhesion determined by scintillation counting. All three strains showed strong adhesion with the human intestinal cell lines in vitro. Adhesion indices of the three strains to two cell lines, i.e. HT-29, and Caco-2 varied between 99 +/- 17 and 219 +/- 36. With mucus-secreting cell-line HT29-MTX, the adhesion indices of all the strains were 2-3 times higher. The adhesion indices of L. acidophilus LA-1 and L. rhamnosus GG were comparable to the other three probiotic strains. We also investigated the inhibitory effect of adhering strains against the intestinal cell monolayer colonization by a known enterotoxigenic strain of Escherichia coli (strain O157:H7). Pre-treatment of E. coli O157:H7 with 2.5-fold concentrated cell-free culture supernatants from L. acidophilus HN017, L. rhamnosus DR20 and B. lactis DR10 reduced the culturable E. coli numbers on TSB plates and also reduced the invasiveness and cell association characteristics of this toxic strain. The inhibitory molecules secreted into the spent media by these strains were partially affected by treatments with lactate dehydrogenase, trypsin and proteinase K suggesting that overall inhibition may be due to a synergistic action of lactic acid and proteinaceous substances.
TI  - The synergistic effect of lactic acid bacteria and alkylglycerols on humoral immunity in mice.
AB  - Investigations on immune suppression and reconstitution of immune functions dependent on the presence of physiological microflora allow us to conclude that symbiotic microorganisms such as Lactobacillus sp. are essential for adequate activity of the defense system in humans. In addition to their beneficial influence on the intestinal microbial balance, these microorganisms exert a variety of immunomodulatory effects on the host immune system. On the other hand, immunostimulatory animal-derived substances rich in alkylglycerols have been shown to enhance lactic acid bacteria proliferation. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects on murine humoral response of the combined administration of lyophilized combination of three lactic acid bacteria: L. acidophilus, L. bulgaricus and Bifidobacterium bifidum together with alkylglycerol-rich shark liver oil. The lactic acid bacteria mixture induced markedly stronger enhancement of the humoral response than alkylglycerols did. A significant synergistic stimulatory effect of lactic acid bacteria and alkylglycerols was observed in both treatment schedules: post- as well as in preimmunization with sheep red blood cells. However, their concomitant administration exerted stronger immunomodulatory effect than did the alternative route of treatment.
TI  - [Microecological system and its importance in evaluation of the effectiveness of  biologically active supplements and probiotic products].
AB  - A possibility to estimate a quality of bioactive supplements and probiotical foods by their influence on microecological system of a gastrointestinal tract are exhibited as a result of multiyear research. The consist and biological activity of micropopulations, including the normalization of level of protective intestinal microflora, the increasing their antibiosis activity, the elimination of potentially pathogenic microorganisms, the excretion of volatile phenols and indican with urine, the content of volatile fatty acids, enzymes, secretory immunoglobulins in feces, destruction in vitro cholic acid and cholesterol etc., are tested as indicators. The reasoned supposal is advanced that the wide spread of disbacteriosis is connected not only with changing of defence mechanisms (reactions) of macroorganism, but also with accumulation of pathogenic features in microorganisms by action of environmental factors.
TI  - Binding of extracellular matrix proteins by lactobacilli.
AB  - Ten gut and ten vaginal Lactobacillus strains were investigated for their ability to bind type I collagen (Cn-I) and four selected gut lactobacilli were investigated for their binding to other extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules. Immobilized Cn-I (100 mg/L) in wells of microtitre plates was bound by all 10 autoaggregating vaginal strains and by 3 strains of gut lactobacilli from piglets in the range of A570 readings 0.114-1.806. L. acidophilus strain SV31 was much more adherent than the rest of strains. All four gut lactobacilli tested for binding to other ECM molecules displayed good binding to porcine fibronectin and heparin and some of them bound weakly to fetuin and porcine mucin. No binding of these strains was observed to bovine mucin, bovine fibrinogen and bovine lactoferrin.
TI  - Evaluation of two self-care treatments for prevention of vaginal candidiasis in women with HIV.
AB  - Vaginal candidiasis (VC) is a common concern for women living with HIV infection. The authors evaluated the effectiveness of two self-care approaches to prophylaxis of VC among HIV-infected women, weekly intravaginal application of Lactobacillus acidophilus or weekly intravaginal application of clotrimazole tablets, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. VC was defined as a vaginal swab positive for Candida species in the presence of signs/symptoms of vaginitis and the absence of a diagnosis of Trichomonas vaginalis or bacterial vaginosis. Thirty-four episodes of VC occurred among 164 women followed for a median of 21 months. The relative risk of experiencing an episode of VC was 0.4 (95% CI = 0.2, 0.9) in the clotrimazole arm and 0.5 (95% CI = 0.2, 1.1) in the Lactobacillus acidophilus arm. The estimated median time to first episode VC was longer for clotrimazole (p = .03, log rank test) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (p = .09, log rank test) compared with placebo. Vaginal yeast infections can be prevented with local therapy. Education about self-care for prophylaxis of VC should be offered to HIV-infected women.
TI  - Probiotics: "living drugs".
AB  - The uses, mechanisms of action, and safety of probiotics are discussed. Probiotics are live microorganisms or microbial mixtures administered to improve the patient's microbial balance, particularly the environment of the gastrointestinal tract and the vagina. The yeast Saccharomyces boulardii and the bacterium Lactobacillus rhamnosus, strain GG, have shown efficacy in clinical trials for the prevention of antimicrobial-associated diarrhea. Other probiotics that have demonstrated at least some promise as prophylaxis for this type of diarrhea are Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium longum, and Enterococcus faecium. The use of S. boulardii as an adjunctive treatment to therapy with metronidazole or vancomycin has been found in controlled studies to decrease further recurrences of Clostridium difficile-associated disease. Other gastrointestinal disorders for which probiotics have been studied include traveler's diarrhea, acute infantile diarrhea, and acute diarrhea in adults. Several Lactobacillus species given in yogurt or in tablet or suppository form have shown clinical efficacy as a treatment for vaginal infections. Lactobacillus strains have also been examined as a treatment for urinary-tract infections. Putative mechanisms of action of probiotics include production of pathogen-inhibitory substances, inhibition of pathogen attachment, inhibition of the action of microbial toxins, stimulation of immunoglobulin A, and trophic effects on intestinal mucosa. The available probiotics are considered nonpathogenic, but even benign microorganisms can be infective when a patient is severely debilitated or immunosuppressed. Probiotics have demonstrated an ability to prevent and treat some infections. Effective use of probiotics could decrease patients' exposure to antimicrobials. Additional controlled studies are needed to clearly define the safety and efficacy of these agents.
TI  - Use of intravaginal microbicides to prevent acquisition of Trichomonas vaginalis  infection in Lactobacillus-pretreated, estrogenized young mice.
AB  - D2A21, a novel peptide antibiotic has in vitro activity against a wide spectrum of sexually transmitted diseases (STD). In this study we tested the hypothesis that intravaginal D2A21 would interfere with acquisition of Trichomonas vaginalis infection in a modified mouse model. T. vaginalis infections of estrogenized young mice pretreated with Lactobacillus vaginalis or Lactobacillus rhamnosus were more frequent and persistent than those in mice pre-treated with Lactobacillus gasseri or Lactobacillus acidophilus. One hundred percent T. vaginalis infection was achieved for 2-4 days post-challenge when intravaginal L. rhamnosus pre-treatments were given to estrogenized mice 48 hr prior to a single T. vaginalis challenge. Estrogenized mice pre-treated with L. rhamnosus were pre-medicated with intravaginal placebo gel, 0.5% or 2% D2A21 gel, or 500 microg/mL metronidazole gel prior to T. vaginalis challenge. Both 2% D2A21 and metronidazole gels were significantly more efficacious (10% or none infected) than placebo gel (53% infected) in preventing vaginal T. vaginalis infections in mice.
TI  - Lactobacilli in human dental caries and saliva.
AB  - Samples (98 plaque and 72 saliva) from 93 patients with dental caries were investigated for Lactobacillus species which comprised 65 (62.5%) of 104 isolates. Yeasts (20.1%), Streptococcus spp. (8.7%), Staphylococcus spp. (2.9%) and a few unidentified species (5.8%), were also found. The Lactobacillus isolates were L. brevis (24.6%) L. fermentum (18.5%) L. casei (16.9%), L. delbrueckii (15.4%), L. plantarum (9.23%), L. acidophilus (7.69%), L. jensenii (4.62%), L. salivarius (1.54%) and L. gasseri (1.54%). The most common species was L. brevis (24.6%). The strains tested for beta-lactamase production showed 75.4% positive. All the Lactobacillus strains were tested for bacteriocin production against Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella dysenteriae, S. sonnei, Klebsiella spp. and Campylobacter sp. All the lactobacilli except L. jensenii produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. The involvement of Lactobacillus in dental caries was established, although its role and mechanism is not well understood. The ability of Lactobacillus spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident.
TI  - AT oligonucleotides inducing B lymphocyte activation exist in probiotic Lactobacillus gasseri.
AB  - This study determined oligonucleotide sequences of mitogenic DNA derived from lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The chromosomal DNA, which was purified from 12 out of 16 strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus group LAB, induced proliferation of splenic lymphocytes. When DNA from L. gasseri JCM1131T was cloned and amplified using PCR, the mitogenic activities of B lymphocytes were significantly increased by 108 of 321 DNA clones. Ten high homologous nucleotide sequences were found as possible DNA sequences of mitogens, and were then chemically synthesized (sOL-LG1 to sOL-LG10). Two nucleotide sequences (sOL-LG7 and sOL-LG10) that consist of only A and T nucleotides (AT oligonucleotides) were characterized as B lymphocyte specific mitogens because they resulted in proliferation of B lymphocytes but not of T lymphocytes. sOL-LG7 preferentially bound to large B lymphocytes and enhanced the expression of the CD86 antigen more than the CD69 antigen on B lymphocytes. The findings show that mitogenic AT oligonucleotides are likely to restrict pre-activated subsets of B lymphocytes. This study demonstrated that novel AT oligonucleotides triggering B lymphocyte mitogenic responses exist in the nucleoids of L. gasseri and proposed that they have potential as applicants for the production of new functional foods, "Bio-Defense Foods".
TI  - Characterization of the Lactobacillus casei group and the Lactobacillus acidophilus group by automated ribotyping.
AB  - A total of 91 type and reference strains of the Lactobacillus casei group and the L acidophilus group were characterized by the automated ribotyping device Riboprinter microbial characterization system. The L. casei group was divided into five (C1-C5) genotypes by ribotyping. Among them, the strain of L. casei ATCC 334 was clustered to the same genotype group as most of L. paracasei strains and L casei JCM 1134T generated a riboprint pattern that was different from the type strain of L. zeae. These results supported the designation of L. casei ATCC 334 as the neotype strain, but were not consistent with the reclassification of L. casei JCM 1134T as L. zeae. The L. acidophilus group was also divided into 14 (A1-A11, B1-B3) genotypes by ribotyping. L. acidophilus, L. amylovorus, L. crispatus and L. gallinarum generated ribotype patterns that were distinct from the patterns produced by L. gasseri and L. johnsonii. This result confirmed previous data that the L. acidophilus group divided to two major clusters. Five strains of L. acidophilus and two strains of L. gasseri were correctly reidentified by ribotyping. Most strains belonging to the L. casei group and the L. acidophilus group were discriminated at the species level by automated ribotyping. Thus this RiboPrinter system yields rapid, accurate and reproducible genetic information for the identification of many strains.
TI  - The replicon of the cryptic Plasmid pSBO1 isolated from Streptococcus bovis JB1.
AB  - The cryptic plasmid pSBO1 (3904 bp) was isolated from Streptococcus bovis JB1. pSBO1 contained an open reading frame (ORF) that is homologous to sequences encoding the replication protein (Rep) in pEFC1 (isolated from Enterococcus faecalis), pSK639 (Staphylococcus epidermidis), pLA103 (Lactobacillus acidophilus), and pUCL287 (Tetragenococcus halophila). In addition, four 22-bp direct repeats (DRs) were located upstream of the putative replication gene (rep) of pSBO1. Recombinant plasmids (pSBE10 and pSBE11) containing the DRs and putative rep of pSBO1 replicated in S. bovis 12-U-1 and no8 strains. This result indicates that the putative rep encoded Rep and that the replicon of pSBO1 contained the DRs and the rep. Gel shift assays showed that the Rep of pSBO1 bound the 22-bp DRs.
TI  - Antimicrobial protein produced by vaginal Lactobacillus acidophilus that inhibits Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To isolate bacteriocin from a vaginal strain of Lactobacillus acidophilus. METHODS: L. acidophilus 160 was grown on two media. The first was MRS broth for 18 hours; the cells were harvested, washed, and placed into a chemically defined medium. The second medium resembled vaginal fluid minus protein. Bacteriocin was precipitated from both media using ammonium sulfate. The growth-inhibiting activity of bacteriocin was determined by a bioassay using nine different isolates of Gardnerella vaginalis. RESULTS: MRS broth is not a suitable medium for extracting bacteriocin, because it binds with Tween 80. Bacteriocin was isolated, without contaminating constituents, from chemically defined medium and identified as a single band by electrophoresis. Bacteriocin has a molecular weight of 3.8 kDa. All nine isolates of Gardnerella were inhibited by the bacteriocin isolated from L. acidophilus 160. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteriocin produced by L. acidophilus 160 was isolated from the chemically defined medium (starvation medium) in a partially pure form. L. acidophilus 160 bacteriocin inhibited growth of all nine isolates of Gardnerella vaginalis.
TI  - Effect of lipid composition on the stability of cellular membranes during freeze-thawing of Lactobacillus acidophilus grown at different temperatures.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 640 grown at the optimal temperature of 37 degrees  C (M37) appeared more sensitive to freeze-thawing than when it was grown at 25 degrees C (M25). In the first case, 87% of the cells died, in contrast to 33% for cells grown at 25 degrees C. All the surviving M37 cells showed sensitivity to NaCl. However, among the surviving M25 cells, only 85% were sensitive to NaCl. The rest of the cells were considered uninjured. Freeze-thawing in cells grown at 25 degrees C showed a liberation of nucleic acids and proteins. However, the leakage was higher in M37 cells after freeze-thawing. The greater fraction of damaged cells were observed in M25 culture after freeze-thawing. A relative increase of 81% in cardiolipid (CL), with respect to total phospholipids and 72% triglycosyldiglyceride (TGDG) with respect to the total glycolipids was observed in M37. In addition, a decrease of palmitoyl (C16:0), oleoyl (C18:0) fatty acids at CL, phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and diglicosyldiglyceride (DGDG) fractions and the increase of C19 cyc and C18:0, 10-OH fatty acids in neutral lipid, and CL fractions was also apparent. In M25 cells, the concentration of DGDG and PG was higher than in M37 cells. The difference in cryotolerance between the frozen cultures emphasizes the importance of selecting appropriate conditions of growth of microorganisms for use as dietary adjuncts.
TI  - Bacteremic infection with Pediococcus: vancomycin-resistant opportunist.
AB  - Pediococci are recently recognized Gram-positive human pathogens, resistant to vancomycin and generally susceptible to penicillin. Infection in adults has been seen in patients with chronic underlying conditions as well as those with previous abdominal surgery. Two previous infants with congenital gastrointestinal malformations requiring surgical correction have been reported with sepsis attributable to Pediococcus sp. We report a third infant born with gastroschisis who developed Pediococcus bacteremia and meningitis 3 months after surgery, and speculate regarding the role of probiotics in the pathogenesis of this infection.

TI  - Comparison of microbicides for efficacy in protecting mice against vaginal challenge with herpes simplex virus type 2, cytotoxicity, antibacterial properties, and sperm immobilization.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, a number of different over-the-counter spermicides and potential microbicides under development are in various phases of clinical trials. It is difficult to know how the various formulations would compare with each other or how efficacious they would be because no existing microbicides are commercially available. GOAL: To evaluate, in a standardized manner, various parameters of potential microbicides. STUDY DESIGN: In an effort to make a comprehensive comparison, several potential microbicides and over-the-counter vaginal products were assayed for their efficacy in protecting mice from infection by herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), for their cytotoxicity to human vaginal epithelial cells, for their effect on the growth rate of L acidophilus, and for their spermicidal activity. Test formulations were K-Y Plus, Gynol II, Advantage S, Replens, BufferGel, No Fertil, Carrageenan, and PC-550. Additionally, several formulations were evaluated for their use as a possible placebo in microbicide clinical trials. RESULTS: The formulations tested fell into three categories of efficacy in protecting mice from HSV-2 infection. The most efficacious were Carraguard and PC-550. All the other test formulations except methyl cellulose afforded varying degrees of protection against herpes simplex virus-2 infection. It was found that formulations containing the surfactant N9 had a cytotoxic effect on human vaginal cells, inhibited the growth rate of L acidophilus, and exhibited spermicidal activity. In addition, it was found that Replens, BufferGel, No Fertil, and the Carbopol formulation might have some effect on sperm motility. Also, K-Y Jelly significantly inhibited the growth rate of L acidophilus. CONCLUSION: Evaluating formulations under the same testing conditions can help to distinguish among potential formulations that are likely to show promise as safe and effective microbicides.

TI  - Adsorption effect of activated charcoal on enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli.
AB  - The adsorption property of activated charcoal on verotoxin (VT)-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) was examined using E. coli O157:H7. In the present study, E. coli O157:H7 strains were effectively adsorbed by activated charcoal. Adsorption was dose-dependent, and the maximum adsorption occurred within 5 min. At 10 mg of activated charcoal, bacteria tested were completely adsorbed. Activated charcoal also had the capacity to adsorb toxin (verotoxin 2) activity from the bacterial extract. Furthermore, the adsorption efficiency of activated charcoal for the normal bacterial flora in the intestine was assessed using Enterococcus faecium, Bifidobacterium thermophilum, and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Activated charcoal showed lower binding capacity to the normal bacterial flora tested than that to E. coli O157:H7 strains. These results suggest that activated charcoal could be a good adsorbent system for the removal of VTEC and verotoxin.
TI  - Characterization of the lactic acid bacteria in ewe's milk and cheese from northwest Argentina.
AB  - Indigenous lactic acid bacteria in ewe's milk and artisanal cheese were studied in four samples of fresh raw milk and four 1-month-old cheeses from the provinces of northwest Argentina. Mean growth counts on M17, MRS, and MSE agar media did not show significant differences (P < 0.05) in raw milk and cheeses. Isolates of lactic acid bacteria from milk were identified as Enterococcus (48%), lactococci (14%), leuconostocs (8%), and lactobacilli (30%). All lactococci were identified as Lactococcus lactis (subsp. lactis and subsp. cremoris). Lactobacilli were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum (92%) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (8%). Enterococci (59%) and lactobacilli (41%) were isolated from cheeses. L. plantarum (93%), L. acidophilus (5%), and Lactobacillus casei (2%) were most frequently isolated. L. lactis subsp. lactis biovar diacetylactis strains were considered as fast acid producers. L. lactis subsp. cremoris strains were slow acid producers. L. plantarum and L. casei strains identified from the cheeses showed slow acid production. The majority of the lactobacilli and Lactococcus lactis strains utilized citrate and produced diacetyl and acetoin in milk. Enzyme activities (API-ZYM tests) of lactococci were low, but activities of L. plantarum strains were considerably higher. The predominance of L. plantarum in artisanal cheese is probably important in the ripening of these cheeses due to their physiological and biochemical characteristics.
TI  - Thin layer chromatographic determination of organic acids for rapid identification of bifidobacteria at genus level.
AB  - This study presents a simple and fast method for the identification of bifidobacteria using a thin layer chromatographic (TLC) analysis of the short chain fatty acids in a culture broth. When the chromatogram was sprayed with the indicator solution (methyl red-bromophenol blue in 70% ethanol), lactic acid exhibited two red spots, and acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid all produced blue spots. Succinic acid and citric acid produced yellow and dark yellow spot, respectively. In addition, these organic acids showed different R(f) values. The total time taken to analyze the organic acids in the 10 bacterial culture broths using the proposed method was approximately 50 min. The proposed TLC method was used to analyze the organic acids in culture broths of the following strains, five Bifidobacterium species. (Bifidobacterium longum, B. breve, B. infantis, B. bifidum, and B. adolescentis) and five other lactic acid bacteria strains (Lactobacillus casei, L. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and S. lactis). Both spots of lactic acid and acetic acid were detected on all the TLC plates from the five bifidobacterial culture broths. The five other lactic acid bacterial culture broths, however, only exhibited lactic acid spots. Accordingly, the proposed TLC method would appear to be a useful tool for rapid identification of Bifidobacterium spp. at the genus level.
TI  - Formulations and processing of yogurt affect the microbial quality of carbonated  yogurt.
AB  - Carbonation, flavor, culture type, pH, and storage time were varied to investigate the effects of these variables and their interactions on the growth of both typical and nontypical yogurt cultures and some contaminating bacteria. Two types of yogurt cultures (YC-470 and YC-180) were used as the source of typical yogurt bacteria, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. In addition, Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA-K) and Bifidobacterium longum ATCC 15707 were added as nontypical yogurt cultures to make sweetened low fat (1%) Swiss-style plain, strawberry, and lemon yogurts. Samples were incubated at 43 degrees C until pH values of 5.0 or 4.2 were reached. Strawberry yogurts at low (4.2) and high (5.0) pHs were divided into three portions, which were separately inoculated with contaminating bacteria, Bacillus licheniformis ATCC 14580, Escherichia coli ATCC 11775, and Listeria monocytogenes Scott A. After incorporation of carbon dioxide (1.10 to 1.27 volume of CO2 gas dissolved in water), the yogurt was stored at 4 degrees C for a 90-d period. Carbon dioxide did not affect the growth of typical or nontypical yogurt bacteria. Also, CO2 did not inhibit the growth of undesirable microorganisms. In general, low levels of CO2 did not affect the bacterial population in yogurt. The microflora of yogurt were influenced by culture type, pH, flavor type, and storage time or their interactions.
TI  - 16S ribosomal DNA terminal restriction fragment pattern analysis of bacterial communities in feces of rats fed Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM.
AB  - 16S ribosomal DNA terminal restriction fragment patterns from rat fecal samples were analyzed to track the dynamics of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and discern bacterial populations that changed during feeding with NCFM. Lactobacillus johnsonii and Ruminococcus flavefaciens were tentatively identified as such bacterial populations. The presence of L. johnsonii was confirmed by isolation from feces.
TI  - Verification of hypocholesterolemic effect of fermented milk on human subjects with different cholesterol levels.
AB  - The possible hypocholesterolemic effect of acidophilus milk was evaluated on 27 human subjects having different levels of serum cholesterol, i.e. < 2.0 (group C1), 2.0-2.2 (C2), 2.2-2.5 (C3) and > 2.5 g/L (C4). The acidophilus milk was prepared by fermentation of low-fat milk with Lactobacillus acidophilus and was fed to each volunteer at the rate of 200 mL/d for 20 d. Blood samples from the volunteers were collected and analyzed for lipid profile twice prior to, during and after feeding, keeping a gap of 10 d between two collections. A significant decrease (p < 0.05) in average total cholesterol was found in the C2 and C3 groups, amounting to 21 and 12%, respectively. The average LDL cholesterol decreased in C2, C3 and C4 groups by 0.54, 0.26 and 0.46 g/L, respectively. In the C2 group, the LDL/HDL and total/HDL ratio was also reduced by 1.4 and 1.3, respectively. However, in the C1 group, the average total and LDL cholesterol level did not show any significant change but serum triacylglycerols and VLDL cholesterol showed a significant (p < 0.05) increase of 0.53 and 0.11 g/L, respectively. Regression analysis of the data revealed a square trend in most of the parameters over time period. Overall, the feeding had the best effect in the subjects with lipidemic status of borderline cholesterol level (2.0-2.2 g/L) group.
TI  - [Effect of microbial derived agents on the level of blood cytokines, hematological status and survival of mice following combined radiation injury].
AB  - Mice models of acute radiation and combined radiation injuries (whole body irradiation + thermal burn) were used for the experiments. Blood serum response of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-3, and GM-CSF was evaluated after single injection of bacterially derived products (BDPs). As it was established, BDPs revealed different ability for cytokine increasing activity: Imuvert (extract from Serratia marcescens) > synthetic trehalose dicorynomycolate > heat-killed Lactobacillus acidophilus. The capacity of BDPs to enhance survival of animals did not depend on its cytokine-inducing and hematopoietic activities.
TI  - Phenotypic and molecular identification and clustering of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts from wheat (species Triticum durum and Triticum aestivum) sourdoughs of Southern Italy.
AB  - The microflora of 25 wheat sourdoughs from the Apulia region, Southern Italy, was characterized. The sourdoughs were mainly produced from Triticum durum wheat. The number of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts ranged from ca. log 7.5 to log 9.3 colony forming units (cfu)/g and from log 5.5 to log 8.4 cfu/g, respectively. About 38% of the 317 isolates of lactic acid bacteria were identified by conventional physiological and biochemical tests. Phenotypic identification was confirmed by 16S rDNA and 16S/23S rRNA spacer region PCR. Overall, 30% of the isolates were identified as Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, 20% as Lb. alimentarius, 14% as Lb. brevis, 12% as Leuconostoc citreum, 7% as Lb. plantarum, 6% as Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, 4% as Lb. fermentum and Lb. acidophilus, 2% as Weissella confusa and 1% as Lb. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii. Some of these species have not been previously isolated from sourdoughs. Since bakers yeast is widely used in sourdough production, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was largely found. The phenotypical relationships within the main lactic acid bacteria identified were established by using cluster analysis. A microbial map of the 25 sourdoughs was plotted showing characteristic associations among lactic acid bacteria and differences in the lactic acid bacteria species which were mainly due to the species of wheat flour, use of bakers yeast and type of bread.
TI  - Effects of ingestion of yogurts containing Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus acidophilus on spleen and Peyer's patch lymphocyte populations in the mouse.
AB  - Certain probiotic lactic acid bacteria have been reported to improve immune system function. Here, the effects of ingesting yogurts on lymphocyte populations in the spleens and Peyer's patches were determined in mice. Three probiotic-supplemented yogurts containing Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus acidophilus and one conventional yogurt containing only S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus were prepared from commercial starter cultures and used in the study. B6C3F1 female mice were fed the four different types of yogurts mixed with an AIN-93G diet in a 50:50 (wt/wt) ratio. Nonfat dry milk mixed at a 50:50 (wt/wt) ratio with AIN-93G diet was used as the control. After a 14-day feeding period, spleen and Peyer's patches were removed and lymphocytes subjected to phenotype analysis by flow cytometry. Ingestion of the four yogurts had no effect on percentages of CD8+ (cytotoxic T cells), B220+ (B cells), IgA+, or IgM+ cells in spleen or Peyer's patches. The percentage of CD4+ (T helper) cells was significantly increased in the spleens from one group of mice fed a yogurt containing Bifidobacterium and L. acidophilus, and a similar trend was found in the remaining two probiotic-supplemented yogurts. Effects on CD4+ populations were not observed in spleens of mice fed conventional yogurt or in the Peyer's patches of any of the four yogurt groups. In total, the results suggested that ingestion of conventional or probiotic-supplemented yogurts for 2 weeks had very little effect on lymphocyte distribution in the systemic or mucosal immune compartments.
TI  - Evaluation of avian-specific probiotic and Salmonella enteritidis-, Salmonella typhimurium-, and Salmonella heidelberg-specific antibodies on cecal colonization and organ invasion of Salmonella enteritidis in broilers.
AB  - Salmonella Enteritidis colonizes the intestinal tract of poultry and causes foodborne illness in humans. Reduction of Salmonella Enteritidis colonization in the intestinal tract of poultry reduces potential carcass contamination during slaughter. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of an avian-specific probiotic combined with Salmonella Enteritidis-, Salmonella Typhimurium-, and Salmonella Heidelberg-specific antibodies on the cecal colonization and organ invasion of Salmonella Enteritidis in broiler as well as on body weights. The treatment group was defined as chicks spray-vaccinated with Avian Pac Plus at the hatchery and given Avian Pac Plus for the first 3 days after placement. An intermediate treatment was given at 10 and 14 days, 2 days prior to vaccination and 2 days postvaccination. All birds were vaccinated with Newcastle disease vaccine, La Sota virus (one drop/eye) at 12 days of age. A final treatment was given 3 days preslaughter. The control group was defined as chicks not given Avian Pac Plus at any time. Six hours after oral administration of the probiotic suspension (treatment group) or water (control group) at placement, the chicks were challenged with Salmonella Enteritidis. All chickens were orally inoculated with 0.25 ml of Salmonella Enteritidis that contained 4 x 10(7) CFU/1.0 ml. Cecal colonization and organ invasion were evaluated for Salmonella Enteritidis on days 0, 1, 3, 7, 10, 17, 24, 31, 38, and 41. The probiotic-treated group had a significantly lower concentration of Salmonella Enteritidis cecal colonization at days 3, 7, 10, 17, 24, 31, 38, and 41 when compared to the nontreated, control group (P < 0.05). Similarly, there was a significant difference (P < 0.05) in the isolation of Salmonella Enteritidis from the internal organs (liver and spleen) when probiotic-treated and nonprobiotic-treated groups were compared. There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) in the mean body weight between the two experimental groups at each collection period. These results indicated that a combination of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus faecium, and Salmonella Enteritidis, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Salmonella Heidelberg-Specific antibodies have a beneficial effect in reducing the colonization of Salmonella Enteritidis in market-aged broilers.
TI  - Influence of a probiotic yoghurt on the status of vitamins B(1), B(2) and B(6) in the healthy adult human.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The main reason for this study was to determine whether yoghurt  bacteria, being rich in some water-soluble vitamins, release them or utilize vitamins from their surroundings. Our study was trying to determine for the first time, if the viable bacteria of probiotic yoghurt are able to influence the parameters of the B-vitamin (B(1), B(2), B(6)) status of the healthy adult human. METHODS: The test yoghurt was commercially available probiotic yoghurt prepared with Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus acidophilus, enriched with Lactobacillus casei GG. Different chemical forms of all investigated B-vitamins were determined by HPLC methods. In order to determine the influence of the yoghurt flora, each of 12 subjects consumed four yoghurt portions 125 g each ( = 500 g) a day, containing thermally inactivated cultures during the first 2-week period and yoghurt without heat treatment during the second 2-week period. RESULTS: The heat treatment of the probiotic yoghurt caused negligible changes in vitamin contents. The plasma levels of thiamin decreased significantly (p < 0.01) after the first 2-week period and kept on decreasing during the second 2-week period. A similar trend was found in the urinary excretion. The plasma levels of the B(2)-vitamers were different. The flavin adenine dinucleotide concentrations increased significantly (p < 0.01) after the consumption of heat-treated yoghurt and decreased significantly (p < 0.05) after the following 2 weeks, in which the subjects received the untreated yoghurt. In contrast, the flavin mononucleotide plasma levels decreased during the first 2-week period and increased during the second part of the study, but the change was not statistically significant. The free riboflavin concentrations in plasma and urine showed a continuous but not significant increase. The concentrations of pyridoxal-5-phosphate in plasma increased after the consumption of yoghurt with the inactivated bacteria and decreased in the second part of the study. However, the differences were not significant. The excretion of thiamin, B(2)- and B(6)-vitamers in the faeces did not significantly change throughout the study period (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our observations show that the bacterial flora of the examined yoghurt does not influence the vitamin B(1), B(2) and B(6) status of man. It seems likely that even lactobacilli of the 'probiotic' type which are vitamin B consumers can decrease the bioavailability of these vitamins for man. Obviously a thermal death of the cells did not induce a release of physiologically active vitamins.
TI  - Immunoregulatory peptides in bovine milk.
AB  - Bovine milk is known to contain a number of peptide fractions that can affect immune function. The vast majority of immunoregulatory peptides that have been characterised are hydrolysate derivatives of major milk proteins. Recent research has also indicated that the metabolic activity of probiotic lactic acid bacteria can generate de novo immunoregulatory peptides from milk, via enzymatic degradation of parent milk protein molecules. In contrast, relatively little is known of endogenous, preformed immunoregulatory peptides in milk that may be relevant to modulating human health. The natural in vivo role of preformed and enzymatically derived peptides is likely to be one of regulation of the neonatal (bovine) gastrointestinal tract immune system, in order to modulate immune function with respect to the development of immunocompetence and avoidance of undesirable immunological responses (e.g. tolerance, and hypersensitivity to nutrients). There is scope for the further characterisation of both the origin and function of milk-derived immunoregulatory peptides, so that their potential to influence human health can be fully appraised. This review highlights our current knowledge of milk-derived immunoregulatory peptides, and outlines areas that are of relevance for further research.
TI  - Adherence of probiotic bacteria to human intestinal mucus in healthy infants and  during rotavirus infection.
AB  - The concentration of fecal mucin and the adhesion of specific probiotics and their combinations in the intestinal mucus of infants during and after rotavirus diarrhea and in healthy children were determined. Mucus was prepared from fecal samples from 20 infants during and after rotavirus diarrhea and from 10 healthy age-matched children. Mucin concentration was determined, and the adhesion of five probiotics-Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus casei Shirota, Lactobacillus paracasei F19, Lactobacillus acidophilus LA5, and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12-and their combinations was tested in vitro. The mean concentrations of fecal mucin during and after rotavirus diarrhea, 15.2 and 14.1 mg/g, were comparable to that in healthy children, 14.9 mg/g. The adherence of probiotics ranged from 1 to 34% in healthy subjects as indicated for the following strains: L. rhamnosus GG, 34%; B. lactis Bb12, 31%; L. acidophilus LA5, 4%; L. paracasei F19, 3%; and L. casei Shirota, 1% (P = 0.0001). The distinctive pattern of probiotic adherence was not influenced by rotavirus diarrhea. The adhesion of Bb12 in the presence of GG increased from 31 to 39% in healthy infants (P = 0.018) and in episodes of diarrhea increased from 26 to 44% (P = 0.001). Rotavirus diarrhea does not decrease the production of fecal mucin or with respect to the adhesion of probiotic bacteria tested in vitro. Combination of specific probiotic strains may enhance adherence in a synergistic manner. Optimal clinical application of these interactions may offer novel therapeutic guidelines for the treatment and prevention of gastrointestinal infections.
TI  - Invited review: the scientific basis of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM functionality as a probiotic.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM is a probiotic strain available in conventional foods (milk, yogurt, and toddler formula) and dietary supplements. Its commercial availability in the United States since the mid-1970s is predicated on its safety, its amenability to commercial manipulation, and its biochemical and physiological attributes presumed to be important to human probiotic functionality. The strain has been characterized in vitro, in animal studies, and in humans. NCFM is the progenitor of the strain being used for complete chromosome sequencing and therefore will be a cornerstone strain for understanding the relationship between genetics and probiotic functionality. Both phenotypic and genotypic techniques have verified its taxonomic status as a type A1 L. acidophilus strain. It adheres to Caco-2 and mucus-secreting HT-29 cell culture systems, produces antimicrobial compounds, and is amenable to genetic manipulation and directed DNA introduction. NCFM survives gastrointestinal tract transit in both healthy and diseased populations. NCFM inhibits aberrant crypt formation in mutagenized rats, indicative of activity that could decrease the risk of colon cancer. A blend of probiotic strains containing NCFM decreased the incidence of pediatric diarrhea. NCFM led to a significant decrease in levels of toxic amines in the blood of dialysis patients with small bowel bacterial overgrowth. At adequate daily feeding levels, NCFM may facilitate lactose digestion in lactose-intolerant subjects. Further validation of the probiotic properties of NCFM in humans and clarification of its mechanisms of probiotic action are needed to better understand the role this strain might play in promoting human health.
TI  - Evaluation of the components of a commercial probiotic in gnotobiotic mice experimentally challenged with Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica ser. Typhimurium.
AB  - Vitacanis((R)), a probiotic preparation containing a Lactobacillus acidophilus, an Enterococcus faecium and a Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has been developed for the prevention of intestinal disorders in dogs and cats. In the present study, these microorganisms were tested jointly or singly during experimental infection of gnotobiotic mice with Salmonella Typhimurium. Four experimental groups consisting of animals given probiotics jointly or singly and a control group consisting of germfree mice were used. The groups were treated with one or three of the microorganisms (experimental) or PBS (control) 10 days before intragastric challenge with a suspension containing about 10(2) cells of the bacterial pathogen. A higher survival (P<0.05) was observed in gnotobiotic mice given E. faecium (82%). All the animals in the other groups died after the challenge but the survival time was longer (P<0.05) for groups given all three of the microorganisms (7.4+/-2.4 days) or given only L. acidophilus (7.2+/-2.9 days) than for the control mice (4.4+/-1.1 days) and the mice that received S. cerevisiae (4.9+/-1.6 days) mice. The survival data agreed with the histopathological findings which showed more severe liver and intestinal lesions in control mice and in mice given Saccharomyces. In vitro antagonistic assays showed inhibition growth of E. faecium and S. Typhimurium around the colonies of L. acidophilus and for S. Typhimurium around the colonies of E. faecium. However, in vivo, S. Typhimurium became similarly established in the digestive tract of gnotobiotic mice at levels ranging from 10(8) to 10(10)CFU/g of feces and remained at these high levels until the animals died or were sacrificed. Among the three probiotic components of the commercial product Vitacanis((R)), E. faecium was the only one that provided protection against challenge with S. Typhimurium. Protection was not due to the reduction of the intestinal populations of the pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Conjugated linoleic acid accumulation via 10-hydroxy-12-octadecaenoic acid during microaerobic transformation of linoleic acid by Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Specific isomers of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), a fatty acid with potentially beneficial physiological and anticarcinogenic effects, were efficiently produced from linoleic acid by washed cells of Lactobacillus acidophilus AKU 1137 under microaerobic conditions, and the metabolic pathway of CLA production from linoleic acid is explained for the first time. The CLA isomers produced were identified as cis-9, trans-11- or trans-9, cis-11-octadecadienoic acid and trans-9, trans-11-octadecadienoic acid. Preceding the production of CLA, hydroxy fatty acids identified as 10-hydroxy-cis-12-octadecaenoic acid and 10-hydroxy-trans-12-octadecaenoic acid had accumulated. The isolated 10-hydroxy-cis-12-octadecaenoic acid was transformed into CLA during incubation with washed cells of L. acidophilus, suggesting that this hydroxy fatty acid is one of the intermediates of CLA production from linoleic acid. The washed cells of L. acidophilus producing high levels of CLA were obtained by cultivation in a medium containing linoleic acid, indicating that the enzyme system for CLA production is induced by linoleic acid. After 4 days of reaction with these washed cells, more than 95% of the added linoleic acid (5 mg/ml) was transformed into CLA, and the CLA content in total fatty acids recovered exceeded 80% (wt/wt). Almost all of the CLA produced was in the cells or was associated with the cells as free fatty acid.
TI  - Potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria Lactobacillus rhamnosus (HN001), Lactobacillus acidophilus (HN017) and Bifidobacterium lactis (HN019) do not degrade gastric mucin in vitro.
AB  - The mucus layer (mucin) coating the surface of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) plays an important role in the mucosal barrier system. Any damage or disturbance of this mucin layer will compromise the host's mucosal defence function. In the present study, the ability of three potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains (Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001, Lactobacillus acidophilus HN017, Bifidobacterium lactis HN019) to degrade mucin in vitro was evaluated, in order to assess their potential pathogenicity and local toxicity. The LAB strains were incubated in medium containing hog gastric mucin (HGM, 0.3%) at 37 degrees C for 48 h, following which any decrease in carbohydrate and protein concentration in the ethanol-precipitated portion of the culture medium was determined, using phenol-sulphuric acid and bicinchonic acid (BCA) protein assays, respectively. The change in molecular weight of mucin glycoproteins, following incubation with the test strains, was monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). In order to expose any ability of the test strains to degrade mucin visually and more directly, the test strains were also cultured on agarose containing 0.3% HGM and incubated anaerobically for 72 h at 37 degrees C. No significant change in the carbohydrate or protein concentration in mucin substrates was found following incubation with the test strains. No mucin fragments were derived from the mucin suspension incubated with test strains, and no mucinolysis zone was identified on agarose. These results demonstrate that the potential probiotic LAB strains tested here were unable to degrade gastrointestinal mucin in vitro, which suggests that these novel probiotic candidates are likely to be non-invasive and non-toxic at the mucosal interface.
TI  - Favourable effect of an acidified milk (LC-1) on Helicobacter pylori gastritis in man.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The supernatant of Lactobacillus johnsonii La1 culture was shown to be bactericidal and to have a partial, acid-independent suppressive effect on Helicobacter pylori in humans. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of L. johnsonii La1-acidified milk (LC-1) on H. pylori infection. DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifty-three volunteers infected with H. pylori as determined by positive 13C-urea breath test and positive serology were randomized to receive either LC-1 or a placebo 180 ml twice a day for 3 weeks. All subjects also received clarithromycin 500 mg bid during the last two weeks of acidified milk therapy. Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy and biopsies were performed at inclusion and repeated 4-8 weeks after the end of the treatment. H. pylori infection was confirmed by urease test and histology. H. pylori density and inflammation were scored using a modified Sydney classification. RESULTS: LC-1 ingestion induced a decrease in H. pylori density in the antrum (P= 0.02) and the corpus (P= 0.04). LC-1 also reduced inflammation and gastritis activity in the antrum (P= 0.02 and P= 0.01, respectively) and of activity in the corpus (P= 0.02). Clarithromycin eradicated H. pylori in 26% of the subjects; LC-1 did not improve the antibiotic effect. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that H. pylori infection and gastritis can be down-regulated by LC-1.
TI  - Gut mucosal immunostimulation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The beneficial properties of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on human health have been frequently demonstrated. The interaction of LAB with the lymphoid cells associated to the gut to activate the mucosal immune system and the mechanisms by which they can exert an adjuvant effect is still unclear, as well as if this property is common for all the LAB. We studied the influence of the oral administration of different geneous of LAB such as Lactobacillus casei, L. acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. plantarum, Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus. We determined if the LAB assayed were able to stimulate the specific, the non-specific immune response (inflammatory response), or both. We demonstrated that all the bacteria assayed were able to increase the number of IgA producing cells associated to the lamina propria of small intestine. This effect was dose dependent. The increase in IgA+ producing cells was not always correlated with an increase in the CD4+ T cell number, indicating that some LAB assayed only induced clonal expansion of B cells triggered to produce IgA. Most of them, induced an increase in the number of cells involved in the inflammatory immune response. CD8+ T cell were diminished or not affected, with exception of L. plantarum that induced an increase at low dose. This fact would mean that LAB are unable to induce cytotoxicity mechanisms. We demonstrated the importance in the selection of LAB to be used as gut mucosal adjuvant. The different behaviours observed among them on the gut mucosal immune response, specially those that induce inflammatory immune response, show that not all the LAB can be used as oral adjuvant and that the beneficial effect of them can not generalized to genous or specie. The immunoadjuvant capacity would be a property of the strain assayed.
TI  - Direct analysis by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry of mixtures of phosphatidyldiacylglycerols from Lactobacillus.
AB  - Electrospray ionization followed by collision-induced dissociation in a quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer of mixtures of deprotonated phosphatidyldiacylglycerols afforded a group of three diagnostic ions of convenient abundance for each phosphatidyldiacylglycerol (PG) present in the mixture. Thus, it was possible to determine unmistakably the identity and substitution positions (sn-1 or sn-2) for both acyl groups of each PG present in the mixture. The method also allows the study of isomeric mixtures of PG and mixtures containing minor amounts of some PG from crude extracts of Lactobacillus acidophillus. The present results improve those of previous studies using fast atom bombardment and electrospray ionization tanden mass spectrometry, in which it was reported that it was possible to differentiate the identity and position of the sn-2 acyl substituent only by the presence of one ion, with variable abundance.
TI  - Molecular discrimination of lactobacilli used as starter and probiotic cultures by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus helveticus, L. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, and L. casei related taxa which are widely used as starter or probiotic cultures can be identified by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA). The genetic discrimination of the related species belonging to these groups was first obtained by PCR amplifications by using group-specific or species-specific 16S rDNA primers. The numerical analysis of the ARDRA patterns obtained by using CfoI, HinfI, Tru9I, and ScrFI was an efficient typing tool for identification of species of the L. acidophilus and L. casei complex. ARDRA by using CfoI was a reliable method for differentiation of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis. Finally, strains ATCC 393 and ATCC 15820 exhibited unique ARDRA patterns with CfoI and Tru9I restriction enzymes as compared with the other strains of L. casei, L. paracasei, and L. rhamnosus.
TI  - Influence of microbial species on small intestinal myoelectric activity and transit in germ-free rats.
AB  - The effect of an intestinal microflora consisting of selected microbial species on myoelectric activity of small intestine was studied using germ-free rat models, with recording before and after specific intestinal colonization, in the unanesthetized state. Intestinal transit, neuropeptides in blood (RIA), and neuromessengers in the intestinal wall were determined. Clostridium tabificum vp 04 promoted regular spike burst activity, shown by a reduction of the migrating myoelectric complex (MMC) period from 30.5 +/- 3.9 min in the germ-free state to 21.2 +/- 0.14 min (P < 0.01). Lactobacillus acidophilus A10 and Bifidobacterium bifidum B11 reduced the MMC period from 27.9 +/- 4.5 to 21.5 +/- 2.1 min (P < 0.02) and accelerated small intestinal transit (P < 0.05). Micrococcus luteus showed an inhibitory effect, with an MMC period of 35.9 +/- 9.3 min compared with 27.7 +/- 6.3 min in germ-free rats (P < 0.01). Inhibition was indicated also for Escherichia coli X7 gnotobiotic rats. No consistent changes in slow wave frequency were observed. The concentration of neuropeptide Y in blood decreased after introduction of conventional intestinal microflora, suggesting reduced inhibitory control. Intestinal bacteria promote or suppress the initiation and aboral migration of the MMC depending on the species involved. Bacteria with primitive fermenting metabolism (anaerobes) emerge as important promoters of regular spike burst activity in small intestine.
TI  - A rapid procedure for isolating chromosomal DNA from Lactobacillus species and other Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - This study describes a rapid procedure for the isolation of genomic DNA from various Gram-positive bacteria. Species tested included Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis ATCC 4797, Lact. acidophilus N2, Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Propionibacterium jensenii P126, Bacillus pumilus and Enterococcus faecalis. Our technique for chromosomal DNA isolation circumvents the need for phenol-chloroform extractions and caesium chloride gradients. Isolated DNA is consistently greater than 25 kb in size and can be used directly for subcloning, polymerase chain reaction amplification, restriction digestions and library construction.
TI  - Probiotic bacteria: safety, functional and technological properties.
AB  - During the past two decades probiotic (health promoting) micro-organisms have been increasingly included in various types of food products, especially in fermented milks. Several aspects, including safety, functional and technological characteristics, have to be taken into consideration in the selection process of probiotic micro-organisms. Safety aspects include specifications such as origin (healthy human GI-tract), non-pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance characteristics. Functional aspects include viability and persistence in the GI-tract, immunomodulation, antagonistic and antimutagenic properties. Before probiotic strains, chosen on the basis of their good safety and functional characteristics, can benefit the consumer, they must first be able to be manufactured under industrial conditions. Furthermore, they have to survive and retain their functionality during storage, and also in the foods into which they are incorporated without producing off-flavours. Factors related to the technological and sensory aspects of probiotic food production are of utmost importance since only by satisfying the demands of the consumer can the food industry succeed in promoting the consumption of functional probiotic products in the future.
TI  - Reduction of fecal shedding of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 in lambs by feeding microbial feed supplement.
AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7, an emerging food-borne pathogen, has  been implicated in several outbreaks in the US. Ruminants, including cattle, sheep and deer are reservoirs of E. coli O157:H7 and fecal shedding of the pathogen forms the vehicle of entry into the human food chain. We studied the efficacy of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus faecium, a mixture of L. acidophilus and S. faecium and a mixture of L. acidophilus, S. faecium, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus plantarum in reducing fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7 by sheep experimentally infected with the pathogen prior to administration with the microbials. Following oral inoculation with 10(10)CFU of E. coli O157:H7, 30 Suffolk ram lambs were blocked by body weight (six blocks of five lambs each) and lambs within the block randomly assigned to five groups. The lamb groups were fed daily for 7 weeks a basal diet without microbial supplement (control) or the basal diet with L. acidophilus or with S. faecium or with a mixture of L. acidophilus and S. faecium or with a mixture of L. acidophilus, S. faecium, L. casei, L. fermentum and L. plantarum. The microbial supplements contained stabilized live naturally occurring bacteria and were mixed with the diet at the rate of 6.0x10(6)CFU per kilogram of diet. Fecal samples were collected weekly and analyzed for E. coli O157:H7 using modified tryptic soy broth with novobiocin as a pre-enrichement broth and cefixim-tellurite sorbitol MacConkey agar (CT-SMAC) as a selective media. E. coli O157:H7 was confirmed by its reaction with O157 and H7 antisera. E. coli O157:H7 was shed continuously and in varying numbers in the feces throughout the 7-week experimental period by all five groups. However, lambs administered a mixture of L. acidophilus, S. faecium, L. casei, L. fermentum and L. plantarum shed significantly lower (P=0.0211) average number of E. coli O157:H7 (2.3log(10)CFU per gram of feces per week) than the other lamb groups over the entire experimental period. S. faecium supplemented lambs were comparable (P=0.0884) to lambs fed a mixture of L. acidophulus and S. faecium in fecal shedding of the pathogen (3.5 versus 4.4log(10)CFU per gram of feces) but significantly lower (P=0.0001) than the control lambs (5.6log(10)CFU per gram of feces) and those supplemented with L. acidophilus (5.5log(10)CFU per gram of feces). Average daily gain (ADG) and gain to feed ratio (G:F) were significantly improved (P=0.0145) by the mixed culture microbials (163.0g and 0.33 for the control, 186.4g and 0.37 for L. acidophulus, 168.2g and 0.36 for S. faecium, 213.6g and 0.46 for L. acidophulus and S. faecium, and 219.1g and 0.44, respectively for L. acidophilus, S. faecium, L. casei, L. fermentum and L. plantarum supplemented lambs. The study indicates that supplementing lambs infected with E. coli O157:H7 with S. faecium or a mixture of S. faecium, L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. fermentum and L. plantarum in the diet can reduce total number of E. coli O157:H7 shed in the feces and improve animal meat production performance as well.
TI  - Probiotics in foods not containing milk or milk constituents, with special reference to Lactobacillus plantarum 299v.
AB  - Lactic acid fermentation is the simplest and safest way of preserving food and has probably always been used by humans. Species such as Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus salivarius are common in the human mucosa, from the mouth to the rectum. In food, L. paracasei and L. rhamnosus are usually associated with dairy products whereas L. plantarum is found in fermented foods of plant origin. A probiotic food product containing no milk constituent was launched in Sweden in 1994. The product is a lactic acid fermented oatmeal gruel that is mixed in a fruit drink. It contains approximately 5 x 10(10) colony-forming units of L. plantarum 299v/L. The strain L. plantarum 299v originates from the human intestinal mucosa and has been shown in rats to decrease translocation, improve mucosal status, improve liver status, improve the immunologic status of the mucosa, and reduce mucosal inflammation. In humans, L. plantarum 299v can increase the concentration of carboxylic acids in feces and decrease abdominal bloating in patients with irritable bowel disease. It can also decrease fibrinogen concentrations in blood. Should probiotics be administrated through foods, the probiotic organism must remain vigorous in the food until consumption and the food must remain palatable, ie, the food carrier and the organism must suit each other. L. plantarum 299v not only affects the bacterial flora of the intestinal mucosa but may also regulate the host's immunologic defense. The mechanisms involved need to be clarified.
TI  - Taxonomy and important features of probiotic microorganisms in food and nutrition.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria are among the most important probiotic microorganisms typically associated with the human gastrointestinal tract. Traditionally, lactic acid bacteria have been classified on the basis of phenotypic properties, eg, morphology, mode of glucose fermentation, growth at different temperatures, lactic acid configuration, and fermentation of various carbohydrates. Studies based on comparative 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing analysis, however, showed that some taxa generated on the basis of phenotypic features do not correspond with the suggested phylogenetic relations. Thus, some species are not readily distinguishable by phenotypic characteristics. This is especially true for the so-called Lactobacillus acidophilus group, the Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus paracasei group, and some bifidobacteria, strains of which have been introduced in many probiotic foods, eg, the novel yogurt-like commodities. Consequently, modern molecular techniques, including polymerase chain reaction-based and other genotyping methods, have become increasingly important for species identification or for the differentiation of probiotic strains. Probiotic strains are selected for potential application on the basis of particular physiologic and functional properties, some of which may be determined in vitro. The classification and identification of a probiotic strain may give a strong indication of its typical habitat and origin. The species, or even genus name, may also indicate the strain's safety and technical applicability for use in probiotic products. Molecular typing methods such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, repetitive polymerase chain reaction, and restriction fragment length polymorphism are extremely valuable for specific characterization and detection of such strains selected for application as probiotics.
TI  - Growth-Inhibiting Effects of Cinnamomum cassia Bark-Derived Materials on Human Intestinal Bacteria.
AB  - The growth-inhibiting activity of Cinnamomum cassia (Blume) bark-derived materials toward five intestinal bacteria was examined using an impregnated paper disk method and compared with that of tetracycline and chloramphenicol, as well as four commercially available compounds (cinnamyl alcohol, trans-cinnamic acid, eugenol, and salicylaldehyde). The biologically active component of C. cassia bark was characterized as cinnamaldehyde by spectral analysis. The growth responses varied with each bacterial strain tested. In a test using 1 and 0.5 mg/disks, cinnamaldehyde revealed potent inhibition against Clostridium perfringensand Bacteroides fragilis. At 1 and 0.5 mg/disk, growth of Bifidobacterium bifidum was significantly inhibited, whereas weak or no inhibitory activity was obtained against Bifidobacterium longum or Lactobacillus acidophilus. The inhibitory effect was much more pronounced in Cl. perfringens, B. fragilis, and Bi. bifidum, compared to Bi. longum or L. acidophilus. Salicylaldehyde exhibited moderate growth-inhibiting activity, but little or no inhibition was observed from treatments with cinnamyl alcohol, trans-cinnamic acid, and eugenol. In contrast, tetracycline and chloramphenicol significantly inhibited growth of all test bacteria as low as 0.01 mg/disk. These results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of C. cassia bark.
TI  - Characterization of cell envelope-associated proteinases of thermophilic lactobacilli.
AB  - The proteolytic activities of two natural isolates of thermophilic lactobacilli,  Lactobacillus acidophilus BGRA43 and Lact. delbrueckii BGPF1, and Lact. acidophilus CH2 (Chr. Hansen's strain) and Lact. acidophilus V74 (Visby's strain), were compared. Results revealed that optimal pH for all four proteinases is 6.5, whereas temperature optimum varied among proteinases. Determination of caseinolytic activity done under optimal conditions for each strain revealed that the CH2 and V74 proteinases completely hydrolysed both alphaS1-casein and beta-casein, showing very low activity towards kappa-casein. The BGPF1 proteinase completely hydrolysed only beta-casein. The BGRA43 proteinase completely hydrolysed all three casein fractions. The proteolytic activities of whole cells were inhibited by serine proteinase inhibitors, suggesting that all four strains produce serine proteinases. DNA-DNA hybridization and PCR analysis showed that BGPF1 contains the prtB-like proteinase gene. Characterized thermophilic strains BGPF1 and BGRA43 were successfully used as starter cultures for production of yoghurt and acidophilus milk, respectively.
TI  - Rapid CE microbial assays for consumer products that contain active bacteria.
AB  - Recent advances in high efficiency separation methods of bacteria allow their rapid identification and quantitation in some cases. A specific capillary electrophoresis (CE) technique is used to identify and quantitate Lactobacillus acidophilus in both pill and syrup health products as well as Bifidobacterium infantis in a powdered formula supplement. Cell viability can be evaluated as well. In some cases, both the living and dead bacterial cells as well as the molecular excipients can be evaluated in a single run.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus administration added to omeprazole/amoxycillin-based double therapy in Helicobacter pylori eradication.

TI  - Encapsulation of probiotic bacteria with alginate-starch and evaluation of survival in simulated gastrointestinal conditions and in yoghurt.
AB  - A modified method using calcium alginate for the microencapsulation of probiotic  bacteria is reported in this study. Incorporation of Hi-Maize starch (a prebiotic) improved encapsulation of viable bacteria as compared to when the bacteria were encapsulated without the starch. Inclusion of glycerol (a cryo-protectant) with alginate mix increased the survival of bacteria when frozen at -20 degrees C. The acidification kinetics of encapsulated bacteria showed that the rate of acid produced was lower than that of free cultures. The encapsulated bacteria, however, did not demonstrate a significant increase in survival when subjected to in vitro high acid and bile salt conditions. A preliminary study was carried out in order to monitor the effects of encapsulation on the survival of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium spp. in yoghurt over a period of 8 weeks. This study showed that the survival of encapsulated cultures of L. acidophilus and Bifidobacterium spp. showed a decline in viable count of about 0.5 log over a period of 8 weeks while there was a decline of about 1 log in cultures which were incorporated as free cells in yoghurt. The encapsulation method used in this study did not result in uniform bead size, and hence additional experiments need to be designed using uniform bead size in order to assess the role of different encapsulation parameters, such as bead size and alginate concentration, in providing protection to the bacteria.
TI  - The intestinal flora influences adhesion formation around surgical anastomoses.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postsurgical adhesion formation is still a cause of postoperative morbidity because no satisfactory treatment or prophylaxis has yet been developed. The present study was designed to investigate the influence of the gastrointestinal flora on adhesion formation around surgical anastomoses. METHODS: Anastomoses were constructed in germfree, conventional, ex-germfree and mono- contaminated rats (Escherichia coli X7 and Lactobacillus acidophilus La5), and adhesion formation was recorded. RESULTS: The germfree group had a significantly lower adhesion score than all other groups (P < 0.05) apart from the lactobacillus group, which had a significantly lower score than the conventional group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The bacterial flora of the gastrointestinal tract enhances adhesion formation around surgical anastomoses.
TI  - Characterization and purification of a bacteriocin produced by a potential probiotic culture, Lactobacillus acidophilus 30SC.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus 30SC was tested for its potential as a probiotic culture. The strain exhibited good acid tolerance in an artificial gastric solution as well as bile resistance in media containing 0.3% bile acids. The strain produced a heat-stable antimicrobial compound that was shown to be proteinaceous in nature and, therefore, referred to as a bacteriocin. The bacteriocin was active over a wide pH range and inhibited a number of gram-positive bacteria including Listeria ivanovii and pathogenic strains. The bacteriocin was purified by 50% ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by hydrophobic interaction column chromatography. The SDS-PAGE of the active fractions resulted in a single band with estimated molecular mass of 3.5 kDa. These results demonstrate the potential of L. acidophilus 30SC as a probiotic culture that can be utilized in the manufacturing of dairy foods and dietary supplements.
TI  - The S-layer protein of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356: identification and characterisation of domains responsible for S-protein assembly and cell wall binding.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus, like many other bacteria, harbors a surface layer consisting of a protein (S(A)-protein) of 43 kDa. S(A)-protein could be readily extracted and crystallized in vitro into large crystalline patches on lipid monolayers with a net negative charge but not on lipids with a net neutral charge. Reconstruction of the S-layer from crystals grown on dioleoylphosphatidylserine indicated an oblique lattice with unit cell dimensions (a=118 A; b=53 A, and gamma=102 degrees ) resembling those determined for the S-layer of Lactobacillus helveticus ATCC 12046. Sequence comparison of S(A)-protein with S-proteins from L. helveticus, Lactobacillus crispatus and the S-proteins encoded by the silent S-protein genes from L. acidophilus and L. crispatus suggested the presence of two domains, one comprising the N-terminal two-thirds (SAN), and another made up of the C-terminal one-third (SAC) of S(A)-protein. The sequence of the N-terminal domains is variable, while that of the C-terminal domain is highly conserved in the S-proteins of these organisms and contains a tandem repeat. Proteolytic digestion of S(A)-protein showed that SAN was protease-resistant, suggesting a compact structure. SAC was rapidly degraded by proteases and therefore probably has a more accessible structure. DNA sequences encoding SAN or Green Fluorescent Protein fused to SAC (GFP-SAC) were efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli. Purified SAN could crystallize into mono and multi-layered crystals with the same lattice parameters as those found for authentic S(A)-protein. A calculated S(A)-protein minus SAN density-difference map revealed the probable location, in projection, of the SAC domain, which is missing from the truncated SAN peptide. The GFP-SAC fusion product was shown to bind to the surface of L. acidophilus, L. helveticus and L. crispatus cells from which the S-layer had been removed, but not to non-stripped cells or to Lactobacillus casei.
TI  - A lyophilized and inactivated culture of Lactobacillus acidophilus increases Helicobacter pylori eradication rates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acid suppression plus two antibiotics is considered the reference anti-Helicobacter pylori treatment. Reported eradication rates are around 65-80%. Human Lactobacillus acidophilus shows an in vitro inhibitory effect on the attachment of H. pylori to gastric epithelial cell lines. Culture supernatant of this bacillus seems to decrease the in vitro viability of H. pylori. AIM: To evaluate whether the supplementation with an inactivated preparation of L. acidophilus could improve the efficacy of a standard anti-H. pylori therapy. METHODS: One-hundred and twenty H. pylori-positive patients were randomly assigned to a 7-day triple therapy based on rabeprazole (20 mg b.d.), clarithromycin (250 mg t.d.s.) and amoxicillin (500 mg t.d.s.) (RCA group: 60 subjects), or to the same regimen supplemented with a lyophilized and inactivated culture of Lactobacillus acidophilus (t.d.s.) (RCAL group: 60 subjects). RESULTS: In the RCA group, eradication was successful in 72% (42 out of 58 patients) from a per protocol (PP) analysis, or 70% (42 out of 60 patients) using an intention-to treat (ITT) analysis. In the RCAL group a significant increase in the eradication rate was observed: 88% (52 out of 59 patients) from PP analysis (P=0.03), 87% (52 out of 60 patients) from ITT analysis (P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: These results seem to confirm the in vitro anti-H. pylori effect of L. acidophilus, suggesting that the inactivated L. acidophilus could be effective in increasing eradication rates of a standard anti-H. pylori therapy.
TI  - Treatment and prevention of antibiotic associated diarrhea.
AB  - Mild or severe episodes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) are common side effects of antibiotic therapy. The incidence of AAD differs with the antibiotic and varies from 5 to 25%. The major form of intestinal disorders is the pseudomembranous colitis associated with Clostridium difficile which occurs in 10-20% of all AAD. In most cases of AAD discontinuation or replacement of the inciting antibiotic by another drug with lower AAD risk can be effective. For more severe cases involving C. difficile, the treatment of diarrhea requires an antibiotic treatment, with glycopeptides (vancomycin) or metronidazole. Another approach to AAD treatment or prevention is based on the use of non-pathogenic living organisms, capable of re-establishing the equilibrium of the intestinal ecosystem. Several organisms have been used in treatment or prophylaxis of AAD such as selected strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium longum, and Enterococcus faecium. Another biotherapeutic agent, a non-pathogenic yeast, Saccharomyces boulardii has been used. In animal models of C. difficile colitis initiated by clindamycin, animals treated with S. boulardii (at end of vancomycin therapy) had a significant decrease in C. difficile colony-forming units, and of toxin B production. In several clinical randomised trials (versus placebo), S. boulardii has demonstrated its effectiveness by decreasing significantly the occurrence of C. difficile colitis and preventing the pathogenic effects of toxins A and B of C. difficile. It has been shown to be a safe and effective therapy in relapses of C. difficile colitis. A good response has been seen in children with AAD, treated by S. boulardii only. In ICUs prevention of AAD remains based on limitation of antibiotic overuse and spread of C. difficile or other agents of AAD should be prevented by improved hygiene measures (single rooms, private bathrooms for patients, use of gloves and hand washing for personnel). In addition the increasing use of biotherapeutic agents such as S. boulardii should permit the prevention of the major side effect of antibiotics, i.e. AAD in at risk patients.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus autolysins inhibit Helicobacter pylori in vitro.
AB  - Antibacterial activity of 17 strains of lactobacilli was tested against 10 strains of H. pylori. The inhibition observed was related to the acid production and the low pH attained. No relationship between CagA phenotype of H. pylori strains and tolerance to lactic acid was observed. In mixed cultures, L. acidophilus CRL 639 showed an autolytic behavior after 24 h of culture. At this moment, H. pylori CCUG17874 showed a decrease of 2 log-cycle, and no viable count was detected after 48 h. The bactericidal effect of L. acidophilus CRL 639 in mixed cultures is related to a proteinaceous compound released after cell lysis.
TI  - A low-pH-inducible, stationary-phase acid tolerance response in Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 639.
AB  - Acidity is an important environmental condition encountered by lactobacilli during food fermentation. In this report we show that triggering the stationary-phase acid tolerance response (ATR) in L. acidophilus CRL 639 depends on the final growth pH. In free-pH fermentation runs (final pH = 4.5), the cells were completely resistant to acid stress, whereas cells from cultures under controlled pH (pH = 6.0) were very sensitive. The relationship between the final pH and the development of cross-resistance to different kinds of environmental stress was also evaluated. The study of protein profiles showed the overexpression of 16 proteins from 6.5 to 70.9 kDa in stationary phase cells. Seven of these proteins (26.3, 41.4, 48.7, 49.3, 54.5, 56.1, and 70.9 kDa) were expressed as result of the stationary phase itself, while nine proteins (14.1, 18.6, 21.5, 26.9, 29.3, 41.9, 42.6, 49.6, and 56.2 kDa) were exclusively induced as a result of the drop in culture pH during free fermentation runs. These results strongly suggest the involvement of these proteins in cell adaptation to environmental changes.
TI  - Acetaldehyde production and metabolism by human indigenous and probiotic Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains.
AB  - Many human gastrointestinal facultative anaerobic and aerobic bacteria possess alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity and are therefore capable of oxidizing ethanol to acetaldehyde. We examined whether human gastrointestinal lactobacilli (three strains), bifidobacteria (five strains) and probiotic Lactobacillus GG ATCC 53103 are also able to metabolize ethanol and acetaldehyde in vitro. Acetaldehyde production by bacterial suspensions was determined by gas chromatography after a 1-h incubation with 22 mM ethanol. To determine the acetaldehyde consumption, the suspensions were incubated with 50 microM or 500 microM acetaldehyde as well as with 500 microM acetaldehyde and 22 mM ethanol, i.e. under conditions resembling those in the human colon after alcohol intake. The influence of growth media and bacterial concentration on the ability of lactobacilli to metabolize acetaldehyde and to produce acetate from acetaldehyde were determined. ADH and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activities were determined spectrophotometrically. Neither measurable ADH nor ALDH activities were found in aerobically grown Lactobacillus GG ATCC 53103 and Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 strains. All the lactobacilli and bifidobacteria strains revealed a very limited capacity to oxidize ethanol to acetaldehyde in vitro. Lactobacillus GG ATCC 53103 had the highest acetaldehyde-metabolizing capacity, which increased significantly with increasing bacterial concentrations. This was associated with a marked production of acetate from acetaldehyde. The type of the growth media had no effect on acetaldehyde consumption. Addition of ethanol to the incubation media diminished the acetaldehyde-metabolizing capacity of all strains. However, in the presence of ethanol, Lactobacillus GG ATCC 53103 still demonstrated the highest capacity for acetaldehyde metabolism of all strains. These data suggest a beneficial impact of Lactobacillus GG ATCC 53103 on high gastrointestinal acetaldehyde levels following alcohol intake. The possible clinical implications of this finding remain to be established in in vitro studies.
TI  - Immunostimulating and protective effects of an oral polybacterial immunomodulator 'Dentavax' in a rabbit experimental model.
AB  - The immunostimulating and protective effects of an oral polybacterial immunomodulator, Dentavax (D), composed of killed cells from Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and Lactobacillus acidophilus and their lysates, have been investigated on an experimental rabbit model. In this model, mixed suspensions of the above bacterial wild strains have been injected in six sides of oral mucosa. A long-lasting inflammation with the development of infiltrates and confluating abscesses has been observed. The influence of orally given Dentavax on the course of the model infection as well as on the dynamics of the immune response has been studied. A two-fold decrease in the duration and severity of inflammatory reaction, confirmed by the histological findings, has been registered. In immunised animals, an activation of polymorphonuclear phagocytosis, together with stimulation of humoral systemic and mucosal immunity with synthesis of specific serum (predominantly, IgG) and coproantibodies (predominantly, S-IgA) determined by ELISA, has been found. The results obtained proved the strong immunostimulating and protective effects of the preparation D, which is meant for the prophylaxis and treatment of inflammatory periodontal diseases.
TI  - Fractional inhibitory concentration index of combinations of antibacterial agents against cariogenic organisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the inhibitory effects between paired combinations of four antibacterial agents that have been investigated in dentistry against six bacteria associated with dentinal caries. METHODS: The antibacterial agents tested were: chlorhexidine dihydrochloride, benzalkonium chloride, cetrimide and cetylpyridinium chloride. Two organisms each belonging to Streptococcus, Lactobacillus and Actinomyces species were evaluated against these agents. A checkerboard microtitration method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration and fractionary inhibitory concentration (FIC) and summation operator FIC index of the paired combinations of antibacterial agents against the six species of bacteria. Appropriate controls were included. The summation operator FIC index was then used to determine if synergy, antagonism, or indifference occurred as a result of interactions between the antibacterial agents and the test organisms. RESULTS: The data from a total of 295 test results were evaluated. Using summation operator FIC values for synergy as < or = 0.5 and antagonism as > 4.0 as recommended by The American Society for Microbiology, no significant synergistic or antagonistic interactions were observed between the paired antibacterial agents when tested against selected organisms. However, a tendency for an additive antibacterial effect was observed with approximately a third of the test results. Nonetheless, no combination of antibacterial agents appeared to be superior to any other. CONCLUSIONS: According to these in vitro results, there appears to be no beneficial effect of combining the antibacterial agents against the individual cariogenic micro-organisms selected. However, it may be beneficial to use combined antibacterial agents that have a broader range of activity against an ecosystem of bacteria than using individual agents.
TI  - Reduction of Campylobacter jejuni in a simulated chicken digestive tract by Lactobacilli cultures.
AB  - Studies were conducted to investigate the impact of a selected lactobacilli mixed culture on Campylobacter jejuni in simulated chicken digestive tract models. Veronal buffer solutions corresponding to the pH of successive segments of the chicken digestive tract were prepared. The lactobacilli mixtures were prepared by mixing four fresh lactobacilli cultures, including Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus fermenentum, Lactobacillus crispatus, and Lactobacillus brevis. The C. jejuni and lactobacilli mixture were mixed with sterile poultry feed, and the previously prepared veronal buffer solutions were then added separately. The mixture was incubated at 41.1 degrees C for various lengths of time with periodic agitation. The feed passage time for five segments of the digestive tract were adopted: crop (pH 4.5), 30 min; proventriculus (pH 4.4), 15 min; gizzard (pH 2.6), 90 min; small intestine (pH 6.2), 90 min; and large intestine (pH 6.3), 15 min. The Campylobacter and lactobacilli were enumerated. An antagonistic effect on C. jejuni by the tested lactobacilli spp. was found in individual sections and the complete simulated digestive tract models. In the simulated complete chicken digestion system, no C. jejuni were found during the final incubation period when a lactobacilli mixture was present. The results of this in vitro study indicate the potential value of future in vivo studies.
TI  - Molecular analysis of mutated Lactobacillus acidophilus promoter-like sequence P15.
AB  - The promoter-like sequence P15 that was previously cloned from the chromosome of  Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 is active in Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Escherichia coli, but not in Lactococcus lactis. N-methyl-N-nitroso-N-guanidine (MNNG) mutagenesis of P15 was used to select for a promoter active in L. lactis MG1363. Molecular analysis of the mutated promoter (designated P16) revealed a 90 bp deletion and a T-->A transversion. This deletion, in combination with the addition to the transversion, created a promoter with putative -35 and -10 hexamers identical to the consensus promoter sequence found in E. coli and Bacillus subtilis vegetative promoters. The activity of P16 was measured by its ability to promote chloramphenicol resistance in different bacteria when inserted in the promoter-probe plasmid pBV5030 (designated pLA16). The MIC of chloramphenicol in L. lactis, L. reuteri, L. plantarum, E. coli, and L. acidophilus harbouring pLA16 were 30, 170, 180, > 500, and 3 micrograms/mL, respectively. This represents an increase in promoter activity compared to P15 in L. reuteri of 3-fold, in L. plantarum of 9-fold, and in E. coli of at least 2.5-fold, but a decrease in L. acidophilus of 7-fold.
TI  - Improved growth and viability of lactobacilli in the presence of Bacillus subtilis (natto), catalase, or subtilisin.
AB  - In an effort to demonstrate the potential usefulness of Bacillus subtilis (natto) as a probiotic, we examined the effect of this organism on the growth of three strains of lactobacilli co-cultured aerobically in vitro. Addition of B. subtilis (natto) to the culture medium resulted in an increase in the number of viable cells of all lactobacilli tested. Since B. subtilis (natto) can produce catalase, which has been reported to exhibit a similar growth-promoting effect on lactobacilli, we also examined the effect of bovine catalase on the growth of Lactobacillus reuteri JCM 1112 and L. acidophilus JCM 1132. Both catalase and B. subtilis (natto) enhanced the growth of L. reuteri JCM 1112, whereas B. subtilis (natto) but not catalase enhanced the growth of L. acidophilus JCM 1132. In a medium containing 0.1 mM hydrogen peroxide, its toxic effect on L. reuteri JCM 1112 was abolished by catalase or B. subtilis (natto). In addition, a serine protease from B. licheniformis, subtilisin, improved the growth and viability of L. reuteri JCM 1112 and L. acidophilus JCM 1132 in the absence of hydrogen peroxide. These results indicate that B. subtilis (natto) enhances the growth and (or) viability of lactobacilli, possibly through production of catalase and subtilisin.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a Lactobacillus amylovorus mutant depleted in conjugated bile salt hydrolase activity: relation between activity and bile salt resistance.
AB  - Growth experiments were conducted on Lactobacillus amylovorus DN-112 053 in batch culture, with or without pH regulation. Conjugated bile salt hydrolase (CBSH) activity was examined as a function of culture growth. The CBSH activity increased during growth but its course depended on bile salts type and culture conditions. A Lact. amylovorus mutant was isolated from the wild-type strain of Lact. amylovorus DN-112 053 after mutagenesis with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. An agar plate assay was used to detect mutants without CBSH activity. In resting cell experiments, the strain showed reduced activity. Differences between growth parameters determined for wild-type and mutant strains were not detected. Comparative native gel electrophoresis followed by CBSH activity staining demonstrated the loss of proteins harbouring this activity in the mutant. Four protein bands corresponding to CBSH were observed in the wild-type strain but only one was detected in the mutant. The specific growth rate of the mutant strain was affected more by bile salts than the wild-type strain. Nevertheless, bile was more toxic for the wild-type strain. In viability studies in the presence of nutrients, it was demonstrated that glycodeoxycholic acid exerted a higher toxicity than taurodeoxycholic acid in a pH-dependent manner. No difference was apparent between the two strains. In the absence of nutrients, the wild-type strain died after 2 h whereas no effect was observed for the mutant. The de-energization experiments performed using the ionophores nigericin and valinomycin suggested that the chemical potential of protons (ZDeltapH) was involved in Lactobacillus bile salt resistance.
TI  - Production kinetics of acidophilin 801, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus IBB 801.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus IBB 801 produces a small bacteriocin, designated acidophilin 801. Studying the relationship between growth and bacteriocin biosynthesis revealed primary metabolite kinetics of bacteriocin production with a peak activity at the end of the exponential growth phase followed by a decrease during the stationary phase. Both microbial growth and bacteriocin production was inhibited by lactic acid. Whereas volumetric bacteriocin production (activity units (AU) ml(-1)) was favoured under pH-controlled conditions, bacteriocin titres rapidly decreased because of strong adsorption of the bacteriocin molecules to the producing cells under less acidic conditions.
TI  - Use of the DNA sequence of variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene for rapid and accurate identification of bacteria in the Lactobacillus acidophilus complex.
AB  - The Lactobacillus acidophilus complex includes Lact. acidophilus, Lactobacillus amylovorus, Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus gallinarum, Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus johnsonii. The objective of this work was to develop a rapid and definitive DNA sequence-based identification system for unknown isolates of the Lact. acidophilus complex. A approximately = 500 bp region of the 16S rRNA gene, which contained the V1 and V2 variable regions, was amplified from the isolates by the polymerase chain reaction. The sequence of this region of the 16S rRNA gene from the type strains of the Lact. acidophilus complex was sufficiently variable to allow for clear differentiation amongst each of the strains. As an initial step in the characterization of potentially probiotic strains, this technique was successfully used to identify a variety of unknown human intestinal isolates. The approach described here represents a rapid and definitive method for the identification of Lact. acidophilus complex members.
TI  - Effect of supplements with lactic acid bacteria and oligofructose on the intestinal microflora during administration of cefpodoxime proxetil.
AB  - Thirty healthy volunteers in three groups participated in a study of the effect on the intestinal microflora of oral supplementation with Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus acidophilus and oligofructose, an indigestible oligosaccharide, during oral administration of cefpodoxime proxetil bd for 7 days. Those in group A also received an oral supplement with c.1011 cfu of B. longum BB 536 and L. acidophilus NCFB 1748 and 15 g oligofructose daily, those in group B received a supplement with oligofructose only and those in group C received placebo, for 21 days. In all three groups there was a marked decrease in aerobic microorganisms, involving mainly a rapid and almost complete disappearance of Escherichia coli (P: < 0.05) during antimicrobial administration and, thereafter, an overgrowth of enterococci (P: < 0.05). The number of intestinal yeasts also increased significantly (P: < 0.05) in groups A and B over the same period. There was a dramatic decrease in anaerobic microorganisms on day 4 of administration, mainly caused by loss of bifidobacteria (P: < 0.05) in all groups. The number of lactobacilli also decreased but was significantly higher in group A than in group C at the end of cefpodoxime proxetil administration. Clostridium difficile was found in only one person from group A, but six persons each in groups B and C. Of the bifidobacterial strains isolated from the faecal samples in group A, one was similar to the strain of B. longum administered, but most volunteers were colonized by several different strains of B. longum during the investigation period. The administered strain of L. acidophilus was recovered from six patients in group A.
TI  - Study of the cryotolerance of Lactobacillus acidophilus: effect of culture and freezing conditions on the viability and cellular protein levels.
AB  - Slow cooling rate and pre-freezing stress brings about a high increase in the cell resistance and preservation of their physiological characteristics. A brutal decrease in temperature (from 37 degrees C to - 80 degrees C) causes a considerable loss of cell viability, in contrast a slow one preserves a survival rate of 75%. Pre-incubation of cells at low temperature (22 degrees C) during 6 h led to the development of cryotolerance indicated by an enhanced capacity to survive after a freezing treatment of 24 h at - 80 degrees C. Exposure of the cells to low pH (5.5) caused a large decrease in cell resistance but did not lead to any significant decrease of survival rate after freezing treatment. However, an increase of 15 +/- 3% in protein level compared to cells cultivated at regulated pH was observed.
TI  - Stabilization and preservation of Lactobacillus acidophilus in saccharide matrices.
AB  - Lyophilization and vacuum- or spray-drying are some of the most useful techniques for preserving foods, agricultural products, and pharmaceuticals. Biological materials, however, can be irreversibly damaged during these treatments. Therefore, it is essential to design protective agents to preserve protein activity and cell viability. In this paper we examine the use of alpha, alpha-trehalose-borate systems as protectants for Lactobacillus acidophilus during freeze- and vacuum-drying. Trehalose was found to be an effective protectant for freeze-dried and vacuum-dried samples, and it is equivalent to a protective formulation which is in current industrial use. It is known from our previous work on enzymes that the presence of borate can dramatically enhance the protective ability of trehalose. In this work, the addition of trehalose-borate to bacterial concentrate greatly improves the recovery of viable cells after storage. This improvement was seen in freeze-dried samples stored at 37 degrees C as well as for vacuum-dried samples held at room temperature. A tailored buffering strategy was tested to counteract the high pH resulting from the addition of borate to the mixture. Use of citric or lactic acids in combination with ammonium hydroxide gave a protectant solution with high pH (resulting in effective crosslinking between trehalose and borate) but a dry product with reduced pH upon rehydration (conducive to cell survival). These results raise exciting possibilities for protection of more labile prokaryotic species as well as simple eukaryotes.
TI  - Changes in the surface potential of Lactobacillus acidophilus under freeze-thawing stress.
AB  - The zeta potential of Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 640, a measure of the net distribution of electrical charges on the bacterial surface, is a function of the glucose concentration in the growing media. With 2% glucose, cells in the stationary phase showed a zeta potential of -45 +/- 2 mV. With these cells, the zeta potential after freezing and thawing decreased to -32 +/- 2 mV and there was a decrease in viability. The changes in the surface potential correlated with damage to the cell surface as shown by electron microscopy. Freeze-thawed cells incubated in a rich medium recovered a zeta potential of -38 +/- 2 mV without cell growth. L. acidophilus CRL 640 showed the same value of surface potential as control cells when they were frozen and thawed in 2 M glycerol.
TI  - Chemical, physical and enzymatic pre-treatments of probiotic lactobacilli alter their adhesion to human intestinal mucus glycoproteins.
AB  - Intestinal mucus glycoproteins extracted from faeces of healthy adult subjects were used as a substratum for bacterial adhesion to investigate the effects of physical, chemical and enzymatic pre-treatments of the bacteria on their adhesion. The strains studied were Lactobacillus acidophilus 1 (LCI, Nestle), L. rhamnosus strain GG (ATCC 53103), L. rhamnosus LC-705, and L. casei strain Shirota (Yakult, Yakult Ltd). Hereafter the strains are referred to as LA1, LGG, LC-705, and Shirota, respectively. Strains LA1 and LGG adhered greatly whereas the adhesion of strains LC-705 and Shirota to intestinal mucus glycoproteins was low. Adhesion of LA1 and LGG was reduced by boiling, autoclaving and by pepsin and trypsin treatments suggesting that the bacterial protein structures are essential for their adhesion. Treatment in ethanol and in propanol prior to adhesion significantly increased the adhesion of LA1 and LC-705, respectively. Adhesion of Shirota strain was not altered by any of the treatments.
TI  - Antioxidative effect of intestinal bacteria Bifidobacterium longum ATCC 15708 and Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356.
AB  - The antioxidative effect of intact cells and intracellular cell-free extracts of  intestinal lactic acid bacteria B. longum (ATCC 15708) and L. acidophilus (ATCC 4356) was investigated. Both intact cells and intracellular cell-free extracts of 10(9)cells of B. longum and L. acidophilus demonstrated antioxidative activity, inhibiting linoleic acid peroxidation by 28-48%. This indicated that these two strains demonstrated excellent antioxidative activity. B. longum and L. acidophilus also showed the ability to scavenge alpha,alpha-diphenyl-beta-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical, scavenging 21-52%. The intact cells of these two intestinal bacteria demonstrated a high inhibitory effect on the cytotoxicity of 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4NQO). Cytotoxicity of 4NQO was reduced by L. acidophilus by approximately half and by almost 90% by B. longum. Nevertheless, no inhibition of cytoxicity observed for intracellular cell-free extracts of 10(9) cells of B. longum and L. acidophilus. The effect of B. longum and L. acidophilus on inhibiting plasma lipid peroxidation was also evaluated. The results showed that both intestinal strains were able to protect plasma lipid from oxidation at different degrees. The inhibition rates on plasma lipid peroxidation ranged from 11 to 29% for 10(9) cells of B. longum and L. acidophilus. Generally speaking, B. longum demonstrated better antioxidative ability than L. acidophilus in this study.
TI  - Viability of probiotic (Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei) and nonprobiotic microflora in Argentinian Fresco cheese.
AB  - We evaluated the suitability of Argentinian Fresco cheese as a food carrier of probiotic cultures. We used cultures of Bifidobacterium bifidum (two strains), Bifidobacterium longum (two strains), Bifidobacterium sp. (one strain), Lactobacillus acidophilus (two strains), and Lactobacillus casei (two strains) in different combinations, as probiotic adjuncts. Probiotic, lactic starter (Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus), and contaminant (coliforms, yeasts, and molds) organisms were counted at 0, 30, and 60 d of refrigerated storage. Furthermore, the acid resistance of probiotic and starter bacteria was determined from hydrochloric solutions (pH 2 and 3) of Fresco cheese. The results showed that nine different combinations of bifidobacteria and L. acidophilus had a satisfactory viability (count decreases in 60 d <1 log order) in the cheese. Both combinations of bifidobacteria and L. casei cultures assayed also showed a satisfactory survival (counts decreased <1 log order for bifidobacteria but no decrease was detected for L. casei). On the other hand, the three combinations of bifidobacteria, L. acidophilus, and L. casei tested adapted well to the Fresco cheese environment. When a cheese homogenate at pH 3 was used to partially simulate the acidic conditions in the stomach, the probiotic cultures had an excellent ability to remain viable up to 3 h. At pH 2, the cell viability was more affected; B. bifidum was the most resistant organism. This study showed that the Argentinian Fresco cheese could be used as an adequate carrier of probiotic bacteria.
TI  - Development of a chromosome-plasmid balanced lethal system for Lactobacillus acidophilus with thyA gene as selective marker.
AB  - A chromosome-plasmid balanced lethal gene delivery system for Lactobacillus acidophilus based on the thyA gene was developed. The selected L. acidophilus DOM La strain carries a mutated thyA gene and has an obligate requirement for thymidine. This strain can be used as a host for the constructed shuttle vector pFXL03, lacking antibiotic-resistant markers but having the wild-type thyA gene from L. casei which complements the thyA chromosomal mutation. The vector also contains the replicon region from plasmid pUC19 and that of the Lactococcus plasmid pWV01, which allows the transfer between Escherichia coli, L. casei and L. acidophilus. Eight unique restriction sites (i.e., PstI, HindIII, SphI, SalI, AccI, XbaI, KpnI and SacI) are available for cloning. After 40-time transfers in modified MRS medium, no plasmid loss was observed. The vector pFXL03 is potentially useful as a food-grade vaccine delivery system for L. acidophilus.
TI  - Production of pyruvate by Candida albicans: proposed role in virulence.
AB  - Proposed herein is a mechanism for virulence by Candida albicans based upon this  organism's ability to produce high levels of pyruvate, potentially resulting in localized tissue ketosis and undermining the normal defensive function of neutrophil myeloperoxidase. Neutrophils, a key component of our innate defense against microbial infections, seem to play a particularly important role protecting us against fungal agents such as C. albicans. In this regard, it is myeloperoxidase which is central to many of the antimicrobial properties of neutrophils. We have previously shown that metabolic ketones inactivate myeloperoxidase and impair phagocytosis. Thus, production of pyruvate by C. albicans may indeed be a significant virulence factor.
TI  - pS86, a new theta-replicating plasmid from Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of the small (5149 bp) and cryptic plasmid pS86  from Enterococcus faecalis ssp. faecalis S-86 has been determined. Sequence analysis revealed six putative open reading frames (ORFs) encoding polypeptides of 28.3, 11.5, 8.4, 65.1, 7.3, and 11.96 kDa each. Based on sequence similarity, two cassettes have been identified in pS86: ORF1 codes for the replication initiation protein (Rep); ORF4 codes for a putative mobilization protein that shows similarities to Mob/Pre proteins from plasmids of Gram-positive bacteria. No function could be assigned to the other putative ORFs found. According to our results, pS86 plasmid could use a theta-mode of replication, similar to the recently described theta-type replicons from pUCL287 (Tetragenococcus halophila) and pLA1 or pLA105 (Lactobacillus acidophilus) plasmids.
TI  - Solvent extraction of bacteriocins from liquid cultures.
AB  - A solvent extraction method was developed to concentrate lacidin from the culture of Lactobacillus acidophilus OSU133. The new method concentrates the bacteriocin at the interface between chloroform and the aqueous culture of the producing bacterium. Compared with other extraction procedures, the new method effectively recovers higher bacteriocin yield and results in relatively clean preparations. Recovery of lacidin by the chloroform extraction procedure, compared with ammonium sulphate precipitation and cell acidification methods, was >10-fold and about 100-fold greater, respectively. The new extraction procedure saves time and is easy to perform. This method is also effective in recovering subtilin, bacillicin, pediocin and nisin from cultures of Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, B. subtilis OSY1115/C, Pediococcus acidilactici PO2 and Lactococcus lactis ATCC 11454, respectively.
TI  - [The antagonistic activity of the eubiotic Maxilin towards wound infection and its effect on the antibiotic resistance of microorganisms].
AB  - Antagonistic activity of lactic acid bacteria of strain N 2585 of "Maxilin" probiotic in respect to the strains S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, E. coli, Candida albicans and their effect on the level of sustainability of the antibiotic resistant strains S. aureus, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, which are extracted from the patients with open fractures of the mandible under various course of wound process, have been studied. The studies showed that lactic acid bacteria have suppressed growth of strains Candida most actively, followed by P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and E. coli. The use of "Maxilin" probiotic allowed reducing the epidemiological significance of pathogenetic strains already in 3 to 4 days. The sensibility studies showed high activity of the lactic acid bacteria in reducing antibiotic resistance of the strains investigated. It was revealed that "Maxilin" probiotic affects Ps. aeruginosa effectively, somewhat less St. aureus and E. coli. The extracted strains demonstrated sensibility to all investigated antibiotics already in 3 to 4 days.
TI  - [AF, a new bacterial preparation based on lactobacilli and its biological properties].
AB  - A highly efficient bacterial composition "AF" which includes representatives of two genera of microorganisms Enterococcus faecium and Lactobacillus acidophilus has been created as a result of analysis of biological properties of a number of strains of lactic-acid bacteria. Their biological properties--antagonistic activity in respect to pathogenic and conditionally pathogenic microorganisms, ability to adhesion and function in the intestine, sensitivity to antibiotics, etc., have been studied in the laboratory conditions. Prospects of the use of the given composition in production of milk products of functional effects have been shown.
TI  - Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of a gene encoding an extracellular proteinase from Lactobacillus helveticus CP790.
AB  - A 2.6-kilobase HaeIII DNA fragment corresponding to an extracellular proteinase gene (prtY) was cloned from chromosomal DNA of Lactobacillus helveticus CP790 in Escherichia coli using a pKK223-3 vector. The transformant expressed a 48-kDa protein that reacts with monoclonal antibodies specific to the proteinase and seemed to be a pre-proproteinase, but had no proteolytic activity. About 1.6 kilobases of the 2.6-kilobase DNA fragment, which contained the complete gene for the proteinase was sequenced. Sequence analysis found an open reading frame with a capacity to encode a protein of 449 amino acids. The coding region contained a Gram-positive-type signal peptide of 30 amino acids. The N-terminal sequences of the proproteinase and the mature proteinase have been observed in the polypeptide at position + 31 and + 38. The putative amino acid sequence showed a significant similarity to a surface layer protein of L. helveticus and Lactobacillus acidophilus in the amino terminal signal sequence and carboxyl terminus.
TI  - Cordycepin: selective growth inhibitor derived from liquid culture of Cordyceps militaris against Clostridium spp.
AB  - The growth responses of nine human intestinal bacteria to liquid culture of Cordyceps militaris Link. Pt. (Ascomycotina: Clavicipitaceae) collected from a pupa of Bombyx mori L. (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) were examined using spectrophotometric and impregnated paper disk methods and compared to those of tetracycline and chloramphenicol, as well as those of Coptis japonica root-derived berberine chloride. The biologically active constituent of the cultures was characterized as cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine) by spectroscopic analysis. This compound revealed potent growth-inhibiting activity toward Clostridium paraputrificum and Clostridium perfringens at 10 microgram/disk without adverse effects on the growth of Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus casei, whereas tetracycline and chloramphenicol inhibited the growth of these lactic acid-producing bacteria, clostridia and Escherichia coli. However, C. militaris-derived materials revealed no growth stimulation on the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. These results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of C. militaris. As a naturally occurring antibacterial agent, cordycepin could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by clostridia.
TI  - Analysis of promoter sequences from Lactobacillus and Lactococcus and their activity in several Lactobacillus species.
AB  - Promoter-active fragments were isolated from the genome of the probiotic organism Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG using the promoter-probe vector pNZ272. These promoter elements, together with a promoter fragment isolated from the vaginal strain Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 and two previously defined promoters (Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 slpA), were introduced into three strains of Lactobacillus. Primer-extension analysis was used to map the transcriptional start site for each promoter. All promoter fragments tested were functional in each of the three lactobacilli and a purine residue was used to initiate transcription in most cases. The promoter elements encompassed a 52- to 1,140-fold range in promoter activity depending on the host strain. Lactobacillus promoters were further examined by surveying previously mapped sequences for conserved base positions. The Lactobacillus hexamer regions (-35: TTgaca and -10: TAtAAT) closely resembled those of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, with the highest degree of agreement at the -10 hexamer. The TG dinucleotide upstream of the -10 hexamer was conserved in 26% of Lactobacillus promoters studied, but conservation rates differed between species. The region upstream of the -35 hexamer of Lactobacillus promoters showed conservation with the bacterial UP element.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of bifidobacteria.
AB  - Eighteen Bifidobacterium strains were tested for their susceptibility to a range  of antimicrobial agents. All the strains tested, including the reference culture Lactobacillus acidophilus CH2, were susceptible to several groups of antimicrobial agents, they were cephalosporin (cefamandole, cefazolin, cefaperazone, cefoxitin), polypeptide (bacitracin), macrolide (erythromycin), penicillin (amoxicillin), phenicol (chloramphenicol) and beta-lactam (imipenem). Fourteen strains were resistant to more than 10 antibiotics. The reference culture was resistant to only three antibiotics. The results showed that bifidobacteria are resistant to a wide range of antimicrobial agents.
TI  - [The development of a treatment method for streptococcal tonsillitis in children].
AB  - Kept under continuous medical surveillance were 77 children with streptococcal tonsillitis. In all patients, a pathogenic streptococcus (GABHS) was invariably found in culture. Among other common features of the above disease were decline in the tonsil colony resistance state and lowering of those parameters characterizing immunity. A highly efficient means of treating tonsillitis of streptococcal etiology has been elaborated, relying on the use of macrolides and L. acidophilus according to our methods, which can, we believe, come to be widely used in health care practice.
TI  - [The primary screening of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli strains to develop effective probiotic preparations based on them].
AB  - 10 Bifidobacterium strains and 10 Lactobacillus strains were studied for their antagonistic activity with respect to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella ozaenae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and for their sensitivity to antibiotics, widely used in clinical practice. L. acidophilus strain 5/4, L. acidophilus strain 18/4, B. adolescentis strain UX, B. longum strain 44 exhibited the highest antagonistic activity and the highest degree of antibiotic resistance. The restriction analysis of the chromosomal DNA of these strains was then made and their plasmid content was studied, making it possible to recognize these strains in future in the course of in vivo experiments.
TI  - Digestive and bacterial enzyme activities in broilers fed diets supplemented with Lactobacillus cultures.
AB  - A study was carried out to investigate the effects of adherent Lactobacillus cultures on 1) amylolytic, lipolytic, and proteolytic enzyme activities in the contents of the small intestine (from the distal end of the duodenum to the ileocecal junction) and 2) bacterial beta-glucuronidase and beta-glucosidase activities in the intestinal contents and feces of broiler chickens. Three dietary treatments were randomly assigned to three groups of chicks, i.e., basal diet only (control group), basal diet + 0.1% dried culture of Lactobacillus acidophilus, and basal diet + 0.1% dried culture of a mixture of 12 Lactobacillus strains. The results showed that supplementation of the adherent Lactobacillus cultures to chickens, either as a single strain of L. acidophilus or as a mixture of 12 Lactobacillus strains, increased significantly (P < 0.05) the levels of amylase in the small intestine. However, the proteolytic and lipolytic activities in the small intestine were not affected by addition of either of the adherent Lactobacillus cultures. Addition of either L. acidophilus or a mixture of 12 Lactobacillus strains was also found to reduce significantly (P < 0.05) the intestinal and fecal beta-glucuronidase and fecal beta-glucosidase but not the intestinal beta-glucosidase at 40 d of feeding.
TI  - [The range of antagonistic effects of Lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia, Bacteroides spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., Mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. On the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus Lactobacillus, most frequently L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus and L. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the same environment. The diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. Thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties bacteria of the genus Lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this ecosystem. The aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. It was found that nearly all of the tested Lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against Gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit Gram-positive aerobic cocci as Enterococcus faecalis or Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Safety assessment of potential probiotic lactic acid bacterial strains Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001, Lb. acidophilus HN017, and Bifidobacterium lactis HN019 in BALB/c mice.
AB  - The general safety of immune-enhancing lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 (DR20), Lb. acidophilus HN017, and Bifidobacterium lactis HN019 (DR10) was investigated in a feeding trial. Groups of BALB/c mice were orally administered test LAB strains or the commercial reference strain Lb. acidophilus LA-1 at 2.5 x 10(9), 5 x 10(10) or 2.5 x 10(12) colony forming units (CFU)/kg body weight/day for 4 weeks. Throughout this time, their feed intake, water intake, and live body weight were monitored. At the end of the 4 week observation period, samples of blood, liver, spleen, kidney, mesenteric lymph nodes, and gut tissues (ileum, caecum, and colon) were collected to determine: haematological parameters (red blood cell and platelet counts, haemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular haemoglobin, and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration); differential leukocyte counts; blood biochemistry (plasma total protein, albumin, cholesterol, and glucose); mucosal histology (epithelial cell height, mucosal thickness, and villus height); and bacterial translocation to extra-gut tissues (blood, liver, spleen, kidney and mesenteric lymph nodes). DNA finger printing techniques were used to identify any viable bacterial strains recovered from these tissues. The results demonstrated that 4 weeks consumption of these LAB strains had no adverse effects on animals' general health status, haematology, blood biochemistry, gut mucosal histology parameters, or the incidence of bacterial translocation. A few viable LAB cells were recovered from the tissues of animals in both control and test groups, but DNA fingerprinting did not identify any of these as the inoculated strains. The results obtained in this study suggest that the potentially probiotic LAB strains HN001, HN017, and HN019 are non-toxic for mice and are therefore likely to be safe for human use.
TI  - Rapid identification of 11 human intestinal Lactobacillus species by multiplex PCR assays using group- and species-specific primers derived from the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23S rRNA.
AB  - Rapid and reliable two-step multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were established to identify human intestinal lactobacilli; a multiplex PCR was used for grouping of lactobacilli with a mixture of group-specific primers followed by four multiplex PCR assays with four sorts of species-specific primer mixtures for identification at the species level. Primers used were designed from nucleotide sequences of the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23S rRNA gene of members of the genus Lactobacillus which are commonly isolated from human stool specimens: Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii (ssp. bulgaricus and ssp. lactis), Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus paracasei (ssp. paracasei and ssp. tolerans), Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus salivarius (ssp. salicinius and ssp. salivarius). The established two-step multiplex PCR assays were applied to the identification of 84 Lactobacillus strains isolated from human stool specimens and the PCR results were consistent with the results from the DNA-DNA hybridization assay. These results suggest that the multiplex PCR system established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of common Lactobacillus isolates from human stool samples.
TI  - Adherence of Lactobacillus to intestinal 407 cells in culture correlates with fibronectin binding.
AB  - Lactobacilli are members of the normal mucosal microflora of most animals. Many isolates of Lactobacillus spp. are adherent to epithelial cells. In this study, using Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. agilis, we detected adherence in a pattern that suggested that the bacteria were binding to extracellular matrix proteins. Fluorescent microscopy, by using anti-fibronectin antibody, demonstrated that the isolates localize in those areas where fibronectin was detected. In addition, fibronectin pretreatment of the bacterial cells decreased adherence to Intestinal 407 epithelial cell monolayers. Cellular binding to fibronectin was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and affinity binding to radio-labeled fibronectin. Fibronectin may be one of the eukaryotic receptors mediating attachment of Lactobacillus to mucosal surfaces.
TI  - Stimulatory effect of honey on multiplication of lactic acid bacteria under in vitro and in vivo conditions.
AB  - The effect of honey and sucrose on lactic acid bacteria in vitro and in rat gut was studied to determine whether these organisms were affected differently by honey compared with sucrose. Under in vitro conditions, the number of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus plantarum counts increased 10-100 fold in the presence of honey compared with sucrose. Feeding of honey to rats also resulted in significant increase in counts of lactic acid bacteria. Although there was no significant difference in the counts of lactic acid bacteria in the small and large intestines of different groups, the honey-fed group showed a significant increase (P<0.05) in counts over the control and sucrose-fed animals. The results support the fact that consumption of honey has a beneficial effect on the physiological constitution of animals fed with it.
TI  - Characterisation and selection of a Lactobacillus species to re-colonise the vagina of women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - This paper reports the results of characterising and selecting a strain of Lactobacillus for potential use as a probiotic in regenerating the vaginal flora of women with recurrent episodes of bacterial vaginosis (BV). BV is a condition characterised by a depletion of vaginal lactobacilli accompanied by an overgrowth of a mixed vaginal flora of aerobic, anaerobic and micro-aerophilic species in very large numbers. BV has been associated with various gynaecological and obstetric complications and has an extremely high recurrence rate, due in part to the failure to establish a normal vaginal flora after antimicrobial therapy. A total of 60 vaginal isolates of lactobacilli was assessed for characteristics considered important for vaginal re-colonisation. The characteristics studied were the in-vitro inhibitory activity of the lactobacilli against bacterial species isolated from women with recurrent BV, acid production after growth of the lactobacilli in liquid culture, production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and adhesiveness of the lactobacilli to exfoliated vaginal epithelial cells (VEC). Four strains of lactobacilli, L. acidophilus (61701 and 61880), L. crispatus (55730) and L. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii (65407), demonstrated the greatest inhibitory activity against the BV-associated bacterial species. Two of these isolates (55730 and 61880) produced H2O2. All four isolates produced a highly acidic environment after growth in liquid medium (pH <4). Only one of these (strain 61701) was strongly adherent to VEC (>100 bacteria/VEC). A further isolate (L. acidophilus 48101) did not demonstrate maximum inhibitory activity against BV-associated bacteria, but was found to be a strong producer of H2O2 and was also highly adherent to VEC. Isolates 61701 and 48101 could be candidates for use as probiotics for vaginal re-colonisation.
TI  - Lactobacillus fornicalis sp. nov., isolated from the posterior fornix of the human vagina.
AB  - Twelve strains isolated from the posterior fornix fluid of the human vagina were  identified as Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus gallinarum and Lactobacillus crispatus based on numerical analyses of total soluble cell protein profiles and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR banding patterns. Five strains grouped with the type strains of Lactobacillus gasseri (DSM 20077T) and Lactobacillus jensenii (DSM 20557T) at r > or = 0.83 in one protein profile cluster, well separated from the other species included in this study. However, numerical analysis of the RAPD-PCR banding patterns of representative strains selected from the L. gasseri-L. jensenii protein cluster clearly indicated that they belong to two different species. Four strains (TV 1010, TG 1013, TV 1018T and TV 1045) grouped into another well separated protein profile cluster at r > or = 0.87. Strains selected from this cluster displayed very similar RAPD-PCR banding patterns and clustered at R2 > or = 0.78, separate from the other strains examined. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA of two representative strains, TV 1018T and TG 1013, of this group indicated that it represents a new member of rRNA group I Lactobacillus, which includes Lactobacillus delbrueckii, the type of the genus, and close relatives Lactobacillus acetotolerans, Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, Lactobacillus iners, L. jensenii, L. crispatus, L. acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus amylovorus, Lactobacillus hamsteri, L. johnsonii, L. gasseri and Lactobacillus amylolyticus. The name Lactobacillus fornicalis sp. nov. is proposed for strains TV 1010 (DSM 13172), TG 1013, TV 1018T and TV 1045, with strain TV 1018T (= DSM 13171T = ATCC 700934T) as the type.
TI  - Fatty acid composition and freeze-thaw resistance in lactobacilli.
AB  - The fatty acid composition and freeze-thaw resistance of eight strains of thermophilic lactobacilli were studied. Seven of these contained the same polar and neutral lipids, the five major components making up 90% of the cellular fatty acid pool being 14:0, 16:0, 16:1, 18:1 and C19 cyclopropane (cyc19:0). Strain comparison by means of cluster analysis based on the fatty acid ratios using the overlap coefficient revealed two well defined clusters. One was formed by three strains of species Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and Lb. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, the other included five strains of the species Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lb. acidophilus and Lb. helveticus. Resistance of strains with a high content of unsaturated fatty acids (66-70%) decreased with increasing cyc19:0 concentrations. In contrast, in strains with a low concentration of unsaturated fatty acids (42-49%), increasing cyc19:0 levels were associated with increased freeze-thaw resistance.
TI  - Characterization of a phage resistance plasmid, pLKS, of silage-making Lactobacillus plantarum NGRI0101.
AB  - Phage contamination has resulted in abnormal fermentation in silage. We isolated  a phage-resistant strain, Lactobacillus plantarum NGRI0101 from silage. The strain carried two plasmids, pLKL (6.8 kb) and pLKS (2.0 kb). By curing and retransformation of the plasmids, we clarified that pLKS has phage resistant activity, characterized as no adsorption inhibition. pLKS has 2,025 bp and three orfs, orfl23, orf132, and orf918. The predicted amino acid sequence of the orf918 product showed high similarity to those of Rep proteins of Pediococcus halophilus plasmid pUCL287 and Lactobacillus acidophilus plasmid pLA103. The replication origin (ori) was upstream from orf918. There was no gene similar to typical phage resistant genes encoded by known plasmids. The phage resistance of L. plantarum NGRI0101 may possibly be due to a plasmid-encoded abortive infection.
TI  - Probiotic effects of feeding heat-killed Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei to Candida albicans-colonized immunodeficient mice.
AB  - Probiotic bacteria can protect immunodeficient mice from orogastric candidiasis but cause some pathology of their own. Severely immunodeficient patients may be at risk if fed viable probiotics, so this study evaluated the probiotic potential of nonviable probiotic bacteria to protect immunodeficient mice from Candida albicans infections. Heat-killed probiotic bacteria were fed to gnotobiotic bg/bg-nu/nu and bg/bg-nu/+ mice to ascertain if they could protect the mice from mucosal and systemic candidiasis. Both heat-killed Lactobacillus acidophilus (HKLA) and heat-killed Lactobacillus casei (HKLC), in comparison to control mice not fed the probiotic bacteria but challenged (oral) with C. albicans, suppressed the severity of orogastric candidiasis in bg/bg-nu/nu mice at 2 weeks after colonization with C. albicans, inhibited disseminated candidiasis in C. albicans-colonized bg/bg-nu/+ mice at 4 weeks after colonization, and suppressed the number of viable C. albicans in the alimentary tract. HKLA, but not HKLC, treatment inhibited disseminated candidiasis in bg/bg-nu/nu mice at 2 weeks after oral challenge and enhanced the proliferative responses of splenocytes from C. albicans-colonized bg/bg-nu/+ mice to C. albicans antigens. Neither HKLA nor HKLC were able to prolong the survival of gnotobiotic bg/bg-nu/nu mice after oral challenge with C. albicans. These results demonstrate that heat-killed lactobacilli can induce some (limited) protection (probiotic effect) against candidiasis in mice.
TI  - Induction of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 expression by anaerobes associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common disorder characterized by increased levels of anaerobic bacteria in the genital tract. BV has been associated with an increased rate of sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The effects of BV-associated anaerobic bacteria on HIV expression in monocytoid cells and T cells were examined. Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus and Prevotella bivia stimulated HIV expression in monocytoid cells, whereas Bacteroides ureolyticus, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Lactobacillus acidophilus did not enhance HIV expression. P. asaccharolyticus also enhanced HIV expression in T cells and activated HIV long-terminal-repeat transcription in U38 cells. This report suggests a mechanism by which disturbances in vaginal flora could lead to a higher rate of sexual transmission of HIV. Furthermore, this study supports the idea that treatment of BV might serve as a preventive measure to reduce the risk of HIV transmission.
TI  - Immediate effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus on the intestinal flora and fecal enzymes of rats and the in vitro inhibition of Escherichia coli in coculture.
AB  - The in vitro role of Lactobacillus acidophilus was investigated to explore the potential to inhibit coliforms. A threefold concentrated cell-free extract from L. acidophilus SBT2074 could efficiently inhibit most of the tested Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Among the three strains of L. acidophilus, SBT2062, SBT2071, and SBT2074, only L. acidophilus SBT2074 showed this inhibitory property. These three strains were also tested in coculture with Escherichia coli 3544 in skim milk medium. The fermentation could result in complete inhibition of E. coli in 36 h. Short-term administration of L. acidophilus SBT2074 in rats with and without E. coli resulted in significant inhibition of coliforms and anaerobes. The E. coli infected rats regained the normal flora in the presence of lactic acid bacteria. The fecal enzyme beta-glucuronidase activity was also decreased significantly when L. acidophilus SBT2074 was administered and was related to the decreased number of bacteria in the intestinal tract. The analysis of the small intestinal contents showed that the concentrations of coliforms in the duodenum, jejunum, and the ileum were significantly reduced by the administration of lactic acid bacteria. The effects are seen in a short period, suggesting that L. acidophilus SBT2074 fermentate may have clinical application for people suffering from gastrointestinal distress caused by coliforms.
TI  - [Cloning and gene expression in lactic acid bacteria].
AB  - The possibility of using the genera Lactobacillus and Lactococcus as vector representatives is widely discussed at present. The prospects of the construction of recombinant bacteria are closely connected with the solution of a number of problems: the level of the transcription of cloned genes, the effectiveness of the translation of heterologous mRNA, the stability of protein with respect to bacterial intracellular proteases, the method by protein molecules leave the cell (by secretion or as the result of lysis). To prevent segregation instability, the construction of vector molecules on the basis of stable cryptic plasmids found in wild strains of lactic acid bacteria was proposed. High copying plasmids with low molecular weight were detected in L. plantarum and L. pentosus strains. Several plasmids with molecular weights of 1.7, 1.8 and 2.3 kb were isolated from bacterial cells to be used as the basis for the construction of vector molecules. Genes of chloramphenicol- and erythromycin-resistance from Staphylococcus aureus plasmids were used as marker genes ensuring cell transformation. The vector plasmids thus constructed exhibited high transformation activity in the electroporation of different strains, including L. casei, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. fermentum and L. brevis which could be classified with the replicons of a wide circle of hosts. But the use of these plasmids was limited due to the risk of the uncontrolled dissemination of recombinant plasmids. L. acidophilus were also found to have strictly specific plasmids with good prospects of being used as the basis for the creation of vectors, incapable of dissemination. In addition to the search of strain-specific plasmids, incapable of uncontrolled gene transmission, the use of chromosome-integrated heterologous genes is recommended in cloning to ensure the maximum safety.
TI  - [The antibacterial resistance of the strains making up the components of probiotic preparations].
AB  - The spectrum of the antibiotic resistance of 21 strains of normal microflora, mainly forming constituents of widely used probiotics to 25 antibacterial preparations. Lactobacillus spp. were prevalent in the strains under test. The spectrum of the antibiotic resistance of lactobacilli varied, the gradation of resistance being more pronounced with respect to strains and not species. Both highly sensitive and highly resistant Lactobacillus strains were found: L. acidophilus (a component of biopreparation "Linex"), L. plantarum 8RA3, L. fermentum 90T4C (probiotic "Lactobacterin"), L. fermentum BL96. Bacteria used as the components of combined preparation "Linex" exhibited the highest resistance to a number of modern antibiotics. Strains of bifidobacteria were found to be highly sensitive to antibiotics.
TI  - A polyphasic approach towards the identification of strains belonging to Lactobacillus acidophilus and related species.
AB  - A set of 98 strains belonging to nine species of the Lactobacillus acidophilus rRNA-group have been analysed by SDS-PAGE of cellular proteins, RAPD-PCR and AFLP with fluorescently labeled primers in order to find improved methods for their identification. Strains of the following phenotypically highly similar species were examined: L. acidophilus, L. amylovorus, L. crispatus, L. johnsonii, L. gasseri, L. gallinarum, L. helveticus, L. iners and L. amylolyticus. Although the majority of the species can be differentiated by SDS-PAGE of whole-cell proteins, the latter technique showed poor discrimination between L. gasseri and L. johnsonii strains and between some strains of L. amylovorus and L. gallinarum. However, this study shows that the RAPD-PCR (using at least 3 different primers followed by numerical analysis of the combined patterns) and AFLP are most suitable genomic fingerprinting techniques for the differentiation of all the species listed above, and that databases for identification can be constructed, particularly when commercially available molecular tool-kits are used. The separate species status of the recently described L. amylolyticus and L. iners was fully confirmed.
TI  - Probiotic bacteria: selective enumeration and survival in dairy foods.
AB  - A number of health benefits have been claimed for probiotic bacteria such as Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium spp., and Lactobacillus casei. Because of the potential health benefits, these organisms are increasingly incorporated into dairy foods. However, studies have shown low viability of probiotics in market preparations. In order to assess viability of probiotic bacteria, it is important to have a working method for selective enumeration of these probiotic bacteria. Viability of probiotic bacteria is important in order to provide health benefits. Viability of probiotic bacteria can be improved by appropriate selection of acid and bile resistant strains, use of oxygen impermeable containers, two-step fermentation, micro-encapsulation, stress adaptation, incorporation of micronutrients such as peptides and amino acids and by sonication of yogurt bacteria. This review will cover selective enumeration and survival of probiotic bacteria in dairy foods.
TI  - Probiotic culture survival and implications in fermented frozen yogurt characteristics.
AB  - Low-fat ice cream mix was fermented with probiotic-supplemented and traditional starter culture systems and evaluated for culture survival, composition, and sensory characteristics of frozen product. Fermentations were stopped when the titratable acidity reached 0.15% greater than the initial titratable acidity (end point 1) or when the pH reached 5.6 (end point 2). Mix was frozen and stored for 11 wk at -20 degrees C. The traditional yogurt culture system contained the strains Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. The probiotic-supplemented system contained the traditional cultures as well as Bifidobacterium longum and Lactobacillus acidophilus. We compared recovery of Bifodobacterium by three methods, a repair-detection system with roll-tubes and plates on modified bifid glucose medium and plates with maltose + galactose reinforced clostridial medium. Culture bacteria in both systems did not decrease in the yogurt during frozen storage. The roll-tube method with modified bifid glucose agar and repair detection system provided at least one-half log10 cfu/ml higher recovery of B. longum compared with recoveries using modified bifid glucose agar or maltose + galactose reinforced clostridial agar on petri plates. No change in concentrations of lactose or protein for products fermented with either culture system occurred during storage. Acid flavor was more intense when product was fermented to pH 5.6, but yogurt flavor was not intensified. The presence of probiotic bacteria in the supplemented system seemed to cause no differences in protein and lactose concentration and sensory characteristics.

TI  - Antagonistic effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Saccharomyces boulardii and Escherichia coli combinations against experimental infections with Shigella flexneri and Salmonella enteritidis subsp. typhimurium in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus, Saccharomyces boulardii and Escherichia coli are probiotic strains used individually to protect against enteropathogenic agents. In order to determine if a synergistic effect of the individual protective mechanisms ordinarily attributed to each of these biotherapeutic agents is possible, we orally administered Lact. acidophilus H2B20, S. boulardii and E. coli EMO (LSE) to germfree mice. Ten days after colonization of the digestive tract, groups of animals associated (experimental) or not (control) with LSE were challenged orally with streptomycin resistant (Sfr) or streptomycin sensitive (Sfs) Shigella flexneri strains or Salmonella enteritidis subsp. typhimurium. Bacterial counts in faeces from experimental mice showed that the Sfr strain was eliminated 11 d after challenge while Sfs and S. enteritidis subsp. typhimurium colonized the digestive tract and continued to be present at high population levels (108 CFU g-1 of faeces), which is similar to that observed in control animals. All possible di- and monoassociations of the three probiotics with gnotobiotic mice were also performed before experimental oral infection with Sfr. The data showed that antagonism was obtained only when E. coli EMO was present. Different sensitivity of Sh. flexneri Sfr and Sfs to E. coli EMO antagonism could be explained by the different generation times between Sfr and Sfs, as shown by colonization kinetic experiments in the digestive tract of gnotobiotic mice.
TI  - Effect of 8 week intake of probiotic milk products on risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of a probiotic milk product containing the culture CAUSIDO(R) and of two alternative products on risk factors for cardiovascular disease in overweight and obese subjects. DESIGN: An 8 week randomized, double-blind, placebo- and compliance-controlled, parallel study. SUBJECTS: Seventy healthy, weight-stable, overweight and obese (25.0<BMI<37.5 kg/m2) males (n=20) and females (n=50), 18-55 y old, were randomly assigned into five groups. INTERVENTION: Four groups consumed 450 ml fermented milk products (yoghurt) daily. Group 1: a yoghurt fermented with two strains of Streptococcus thermophilus and two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus (StLa). Group 2: a placebo yoghurt fermented with delta-acid-lactone (PY). Group 3: a yoghurt fermented with two strains of Streptococcus thermophilus and one strain of Lactobacillus rhamnosus (StLr). Group 4: a yoghurt fermented with one strain of Enterococcus faecium and two strains of Streptococcus thermophilus (CAUSIDO(R) culture), GAIO(R) (G). The dietary composition of the yoghurt was otherwise similar. The fifth group was given two placebo pills (PP) daily. RESULTS: When comparing all five treatment groups, unadjusted for changes in body weight, no statistical effects were observed in week 8 in the G-group on low density lipoproteins (LDL)-cholesterol (P=0.29). After adjustment for small changes in body weight, LDL-cholesterol decreased by 8.4% (0.26+/-0.10 mmol/l; P<0.05) and fibrinogen increased (0.74+/-0.32 mmol/l; P<0.05) after 8 weeks in the G-group. This was significantly different from the group consuming chemically fermented yoghurt and the group consuming placebo pills (P<0.05). After 8 weeks, systolic blood pressure was significantly more reduced in the StLa and G-group compared to StLr. No other differences were found. CONCLUSION: The CAUSIDO(R) culture reduced LDL-cholesterol and increased fibrinogen in the overweight subjects at a 450 ml consumption daily for 8 weeks. The effect on LDL-cholesterol confirms previous studies. An immunostimulation by one of the strains in the product might explain the effect on fibrinogen in the G-group.

TI  - Potential role of lactobacilli as prophylactic agents against genital pathogens.
AB  - The characteristics required of lactobacilli as probioties are the following: beneficial function, easy cultivation, nonpathogenicity, adhesion, and population stability. Several studies have assessed the potential of lactobacilli in the prevention or treatment of certain genitourinary tract infections such as bacterial vaginosis, vaginitis, or urinary tract infections. The main goal of therapy with biotherapeutic agents should be to prevent overgrowth of a pathogen until such a time that the normal microbiota can be reestablished. The possibility of using lactobacilli is promising, especially in pregnant women and in the case of patients with recurrent genitourinary tract infections produced by strains with resistance to several antibiotics. In addition, probiotic therapy is considered as "natural" and without side effects in contrast with conventional pharmaceutical treatments, but there is a limited array of tested biotherapeutic agents and a lack of pharmacokinetic data.
TI  - Enhancement of natural and acquired immunity by Lactobacillus rhamnosus (HN001),  Lactobacillus acidophilus (HN017) and Bifidobacterium lactis (HN019).
AB  - Consumption of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) has been suggested to confer a range of health benefits including stimulation of the immune system and increased resistance to malignancy and infectious illness. In the present study, the effects of feeding Lactobacillus rhamnosus (HN001, DR20), Lactobacillus acidophilus (HN017) and Bifidobacterium lactis (HN019, DR10) on in vivo and in vitro indices of natural and acquired immunity in healthy mice were examined. Mice were fed daily with L. rhamnosus, L. acidophilus or B. lactis (10(9) colony forming units) and their immune function was assessed on day 10 or day 28. Supplementation with L. rhamnosus, L. acidophilus or B. lactis resulted in a significant increase in the phagocytic activity of peripheral blood leucocytes and peritoneal macrophages compared with the control mice. The proliferative responses of spleen cells to concanavalin A (a T-cell mitogen) and lipopolysaccharide (a B-cell mitogen) were also significantly enhanced in mice given different LAB. Spleen cells from mice given L. rhamnosus, L. acidophilus or B. lactis also produced significantly higher amounts of interferon-gamma in response to stimulation with concanavalin A than cells from the control mice. LAB feeding had no significant effect on interleukin-4 production by spleen cells or on the percentages of CD4+, CD8+ and CD40+ cells in the blood. The serum antibody responses to orally and systemically administered antigens were also significantly enhanced by supplementation with L. rhamnosus, L. acidophilus or B. lactis. Together, these results suggest that supplementation of the diet with L. rhamnosus (HN001), L. acidophilus (HN017) or B. lactis (HN019) is able to enhance several indices of natural and acquired immunity in healthy mice.
TI  - Enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  - Enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against Ent. faecalis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. sake, Listeria innocua, Propionibacterium acidipropionici, Propionibacterium sp., Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium. One of the four pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. No antimicrobial activity was recorded against Bacillus cereus, Cl. sporogenes, Cl. tyrobutyricum, Leuconostoc cremoris, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Staphylococcus carnosus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to Proteinase K, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. Treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. Half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees C for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a pH of 1.0-5.0 and pH 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. Enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 AU ml-1, but increased further to 1600 AU ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. The peptide is approximately 3.4 kDa in size, as determined after partial purification with Amberlite XAD-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The mechanism of antimicrobial activity against Lact. sake LMG 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.
TI  - Influence of growth temperature on cryotolerance and lipid composition of Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - In order to correlate the lipid composition of the membrane of Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 640 with the freeze-thaw behaviour of the cultures grown at different temperatures, fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) from extracts grown at 25, 30, 37 and 40 degrees C were obtained and compared. Cultures grown at 25 degrees C (M25) exhibited more resistance to the freeze-thaw process probably because of an increase in C18:2 and C16:0 fatty acids. This culture also exhibited a lesser amount of phospholipids as shown by the sugar: phosphorus ratio. In all cases, the presence of the uncommon 10-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid was determined. From the extracts of the M25 and M37 cultures, diacylphosphatidylglycerol, cardiolipin, diglycosyldiglycerides, triglycosyldiglycerides and neutral lipids were isolated and identified. The structural elucidation was carried out by FAMEs and sugar analysis and by mass spectrometry using fast atom bombardment ionization. The changes in lipid composition due to different growth temperatures could be indicative of the resistance of the bacteria to freeze-thaw processes.
TI  - Effect of some nutritional and environmental parameters on the production of diacetyl and on starch consumption by Pediococcus pentosaceus and Lactobacillus acidophilus in submerged cultures.
AB  - Three series of 5-day submerged cultures with Pediococcus pentosaceus MITJ-10 and Lactobacillus acidophilus Hansen 1748 were carried out in starch-based media, and the effect of cultural factors on the changes of starch, diacetyl and amylase activity determined. In axenic cultures, Ped. pentosaceus MITJ-10 produced more diacetyl (63.27 mg l(-1)) by adding glucose, yeast extract and CaCO3 (P < 0.01), at 28 degrees C (P < 0.05); but more starch was consumed (18.4 g l(-1)) in the absence of glucose (P < 0.01). Lact. acidophilus Hansen 1748 consumed more starch (26.56 g l(-1)) at 28 degrees C, with CaCO3, glucose (P < 0.01) and yeast extract (P < 0.05); however, the amylolytic activity (10077U l(-1)) was favoured at 35 degrees C (P < 0.01). Little starch was consumed in mixed cultures due to the low pH; nevertheless, diacetyl content rose to 135.76 mg l(-1) at 32 degrees C (P < 0.01). Therefore, both studied strains might be useful to produce aromatic extensors from starchy substrates. These natural aromatic extensors are of interest to the food industry.
TI  - Quantification of micro-organisms in binary mixed populations by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy.
AB  - Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was used for the first time to determine the ratios of different microorganisms in mixtures. Exemplarily, systems composed of two food-associated yeast species (Saccharomyces cerevisiae/Hanseniaspora uvarum) and two yoghurt lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus/Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus) were investigated. Determination of the cell number ratio in the lactic acid bacteria system was possible with a minimal prediction accuracy of +/- 16 ratio percentage points while the minimum accuracy of prediction in the yeast two-component system was +/- 4% (both at a 95% confidence level). These results show that FT-IR spectroscopy is potentially a rapid method for the quantification of cell ratios in mixtures of two different microorganisms, provided that the cell ratio does not drop below a certain, system-specific threshold.
TI  - Acute oral toxicity and bacterial translocation studies on potentially probiotic  strains of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Three potentially probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains, Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 (DR20(TM)), Lb. acidophilus HN017 and Bifidobacterium lactis HN019 (DR10()), have recently been identified and characterized. The present study was designed to evaluate the acute oral toxicity of these strains to mice, and also to investigate bacterial translocation and gut mucosal pathology in BALB/c mice fed HN019, HN001 or HN017 for 8 consecutive days at a high dose of 10(11)cfu/mouse/day. Results showed that these probiotic strains had no adverse effect on general health status, feed intake, body weight gain and intestinal mucosal morphology (villus height, crypt depth, epithelial cell height and mucosal thickness). No viable bacteria were recovered from blood and tissue samples (mesenteric lymph nodes, liver and spleen) of mice, and no treatment-associated illness or death was observed. According to these results, the oral LD(50) of HN019, HN001 and HN017 is more than 50g/kg/day for mice, and their acceptable daily intake (ADI) value is 35g dry bacteria per day for a 70-kg person. This suggests that the probiotic strains HN019, HN001 and HN017 are non-pathogenic and likely to be safe for human consumption.
TI  - Influence of a synbiotic mixture consisting of Lactobacillus acidophilus 74-2 and a fructooligosaccharide preparation on the microbial ecology sustained in a simulation of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem (SHIME reactor).
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus 74-2, which is used in probiotic products, was administered, with fructo-oligosaccharide in a milk-based product, to the second vessel (duodenum/jejunum) of the SHIME reactor, an in vitro simulation of the human intestinal microbial ecology. The main focus of this study was to monitor the changes of the population density of selected bacterial species in the intestine and the changes of metabolic activities during the supplementation of L. acidophilus and fructooligosaccharide in the SHIME reactor. Interestingly, the addition of L. acidophilus 74-2 with fructooligosaccharide gave rise to an increase of bifidobacteria. Moreover, major positive changes occurred in the production of volatile fatty acids: a strong upward trend was observed especially in the case of butyric acid and propionic acid. Furthermore a noticeable increase of beta-galactosidase activity was monitored, while the activity of beta-glucuronidase, generally considered undesirable, declined.
TI  - A kinetic study of the lactic acid fermentation. Batch process at controlled pH.  Reprinted from Journal of Biochemical and Microbiological Technology Engineering Vol. I, No. 4. Pages 393-412 (1959).
AB  - Kinetic data are needed to develop basic understanding of fermentation processes  and to permit rational design of continuous fermentation processes. The kinetics of the fermentation of glucose to lactic acid have been studied at six constant pH levels between 4. 5 and 6.0 by measuring the instantaneous rates of bacterial growth and of lactic acid formation throughout each fermentation. It was found that the instantaneous rate of acid formation dP/dt, should be related to the instantaneous rate of bacterial growth dN/dt, and to the bacterial density N, throughout a fermentation at a given pH, by the expression when the constants alpha and beta are determined by the pH of the fermentation.
TI  - Antagonistic activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus LB against intracellular Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium infecting human enterocyte-like Caco-2/TC-7 cells.
AB  - To gain further insight into the mechanism by which lactobacilli develop antimicrobial activity, we have examined how Lactobacillus acidophilus LB inhibits the promoted cellular injuries and intracellular lifestyle of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium SL1344 infecting the cultured, fully differentiated human intestinal cell line Caco-2/TC-7. We showed that the spent culture supernatant of strain LB (LB-SCS) decreases the number of apical serovar Typhimurium-induced F-actin rearrangements in infected cells. LB-SCS treatment efficiently decreased transcellular passage of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium. Moreover, LB-SCS treatment inhibited intracellular growth of serovar Typhimurium, since treated intracellular bacteria displayed a small, rounded morphology resembling that of resting bacteria. We also showed that LB-SCS treatment inhibits adhesion-dependent serovar Typhimurium-induced interleukin-8 production.
TI  - A probiotic strain of L. acidophilus reduces DMH-induced large intestinal tumors  in male Sprague-Dawley rats.
AB  - Probiotic bacteria strains were examined for their influence on 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced intestinal tumors in 100 male Sprague-Dawley rats. Lactobacillus acidophilus (Delvo Pro LA-1), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (GG), Bifidobacterium animalis (CSCC1941), and Streptococcus thermophilus (DD145) strains were examined for their influence when added as freeze-dried bacteria to an experimental diet based on a high-fat semipurified (AIN-93) rodent diet. Four bacterial treatments were compared: L. acidophilus, L. acidophilus + B. animalis, L. rhamnosus, and S. thermophilus, the bacteria being added daily at 1% freeze-dried weight (10(10) colony-forming units/g) to the diet. Trends were observed in the incidence of rats with large intestinal tumors for three treatments: 25% lower than control for L. acidophilus, 20% lower for L. acidophilus + B. animalis and L. rhamnosus treatments, and 10% lower for S. thermophilus. Large intestinal tumor burden was significantly lower for treated rats with L. acidophilus than for the control group (10 and 3 tumors/treatment group, respectively, p = 0.05). Large intestinal tumor mass index was also lower for the L. acidophilus treatment than for control (1.70 and 0.10, respectively, p < 0.05). Other treatments showed no statistically significant change from control for these indexes of tumorigenesis. For rats fed L. acidophilus, no adenocarcinomas were present in the colons. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of bacterial chromosomal DNA fragments was used to differentiate introduced (exogenous) bacterial strains from indigenous bacteria of the same genera present in the feces. Survival during gut passage and displacement of indigenous lactobacilli occurred with introduced L. acidophilus and L. rhamnosus GG during the probiotic treatment period. However, introduced strains of B. animalis and S. thermophilus were not able to be isolated from feces. It is concluded that this strain of L. acidophilus supplied as freeze-dried bacteria in the diet was protective, as seen by a small but significant inhibition of tumors within the rat colon.
TI  - Lactobacillus flora in the cloaca and vagina of hens and its inhibitory activity  against Salmonella enteritidis in vitro.
AB  - Lactobacilli in the cloaca and vagina of 40 normal laying hens were investigated  quantitatively and qualitatively, and their ability to inhibit growth of Salmonella enteritidis (SE) was examined using a spot-the-lawn technique. All samples of cloacal contents and half the samples of vaginal mucus were positive for lactobacilli. The means +/- SD of total Lactobacillus counts in the cloaca and those in the vagina were log10 5.5 +/- 1.1 and 2.5 +/- 2.6 cfu/g, respectively. In the cloaca, Lactobacillus acidophilus was isolated from 92.5% of hens, and Lactobacillus salivarius was isolated from 85.0% of hens, whereas Lactobacillus fermentum was isolated from only one hen. In the vagina, L. acidophilus and L. salivarius were isolated from 42.5% of hens. In the inhibition assay in vitro, all strains of Lactobacillus from cloacal contents and vaginal mucus inhibited growth of SE. There was a wide range of the inhibitory activity even in the same species. No difference of the growth inhibition zone was observed between lactobacilli from cloaca and those from vagina. The present study suggested that lactobacilli in the cloaca and vagina of hens might have a protective effect against SE colonization.
TI  - Identification of Lactobacillus species of human origin by a commercial kit, API50CHL.
AB  - The efficacy of a biochemical kit, API50CHL kit, for identification of intestinal and vaginal lactobacilli from humans was evaluated by comparing with the results of DNA-DNA hybridization assay. The results showed that in total only 52 of the 172 strains (30.2%) tested were identified correctly by the kit at species level. Especially all strains of some species, such as Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus crispatus, were misidentified as Lactobacillus acidophilus by the kit. However, the kit was found to be reliable for identification of Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Lactobacillus salivarius. This suggests that the exact identification of Lactobacillus isolates from human stool and vaginal specimens by API50CHL kit is difficult without the support of modern genotypic technique.
TI  - Aggregation of sow lactobacilli with diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli.
AB  - A total of 20 strains of lactobacilli were isolated from the oesophagus and vagina of 20 sows at the time of partus. Aggregation activity was seen between six homofermentative autoaggregative lactobacilli and three strains of pathogenic Escherichia coli with F4, F5 and F6 fimbriae. The highest aggregation activity was observed between vaginal Lactobacillus acidophilus PV 32 or oesophageal OE 2/1 and E. coli with F4 (K88). The presence of aggregation-promoting factor (APF) was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers of a specific fragment the apf gene derived from human L. gasseri 4B2 in one oesophageal L. acidophilus strain OE 2/1. We propose that autoaggregative lactobacilli that aggregate with diarrhoeagenic E. coli can express a class of APF proteins that exhibit the function of an aggregation mediator.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus IBB 801.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus IBB 801 produces a small bacteriocin, designated acidophilin 801, with an estimated molecular mass of less than 6.5 kDa. It displays a narrow inhibitory spectrum (only related lactobacilli but including the Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria Escherichia coli Row and Salmonella panama 1467) with a bactericidal activity. The antimicrobial activity of cell-free culture supernatant fluid was insensitive to catalase but sensitive to proteolytic enzymes such as trypsin, proteinase K and pronase, heat-stable (30 min at 121 degrees C), and maintained in a wide pH range. The proteinaceous compound was isolated from cell-free culture supernatant fluid and purified. Crude bacteriocin was isolated as a floating pellicle after ammonium sulphate precipitation (40% saturation) and partially purified by extraction/precipitation with chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v). Further purification to homogeneity was performed by reversed phase Fast Performance Liquid Chromatography. The amino acid composition was determined. Amino acid sequencing revealed that the N-terminal end was blocked.
TI  - Survival and therapeutic potential of probiotic organisms with reference to Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium spp.
AB  - The present paper provides an overview on the use of probiotic organisms as live  supplements, with particular emphasis on Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium spp. The therapeutic potential of these bacteria in fermented dairy products is dependent on their survival during manufacture and storage. Probiotic bacteria are increasingly used in food and pharmaceutical applications to balance disturbed intestinal microflora and related dysfunction of the human gastrointestinal tract. Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium spp. have been reported to be beneficial probiotic organisms that provide excellent therapeutic benefits. The biological activity of probiotic bacteria is due in part to their ability to attach to enterocytes. This inhibits the binding of enteric pathogens by a process of competitive exclusion. Attachment of probiotic bacteria to cell surface receptors of enterocytes also initiates signalling events that result in the synthesis of cytokines. Probiotic bacteria also exert an influence on commensal micro-organisms by the production of lactic acid and bacteriocins. These substances inhibit growth of pathogens and also alter the ecological balance of enteric commensals. Production of butyric acid by some probiotic bacteria affects the turnover of enterocytes and neutralizes the activity of dietary carcinogens, such as nitrosamines, that are generated by the metabolic activity of commensal bacteria in subjects consuming a high-protein diet. Therefore, inclusion of probiotic bacteria in fermented dairy products enhances their value as better therapeutic functional foods. However, insufficient viability and survival of these bacteria remain a problem in commercial food products. By selecting better functional probiotic strains and adopting improved methods to enhance survival, including the use of appropriate prebiotics and the optimal combination of probiotics and prebiotics (synbiotics), an increased delivery of viable bacteria in fermented products to the consumers can be achieved.
TI  - Comparison of viable cell counts and fluorescence in situ hybridization using specific rRNA-based probes for the quantification of human fecal bacteria.
AB  - Conventional cultivation and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using 16S  rRNA-based probes were compared for the enumeration of human colonic bacteria. Groups of common intestinal anaerobic bacteria were enumerated in slurries prepared from fecal samples of three healthy volunteers. To introduce variation between the samples, they were incubated for 48 h in batch culture (anaerobic) fermenters at 37 degrees C, and pure cultures of Bifidobacterium infantis, Clostridium perfringens, or Lactobacillus acidophilus were added. Samples were taken from the fermenters at different times. Total anaerobes, bifidobacteria, bacteroides, clostridia, and lactobacilli were enumerated by both plating and FISH. The results showed that plate counts of total anaerobes, bifidobacteria, lactobacilli and bacteroides were approximately ten-fold lower than the corresponding FISH counts. Numbers of clostridia were higher using the plating method, probably because the clostridia probe used in FISH analyses was designed to only detect part of the genus Clostridium. The introduced variation in the methods could be detected by both methods and was comparable.
TI  - Effects of probiotic bacteria on diarrhea, lipid metabolism, and carcinogenesis:  a review of papers published between 1988 and 1998.
AB  - We reviewed the evidence from human intervention studies for the health effects of probiotic bacteria, ie, live bacteria that survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract and have beneficial effects on the host. Of the 49 studies reviewed, 26 dealt with the prevention or treatment of diarrheal disease, 9 with the prevention of cancer or of the formation of carcinogens, 7 with the lowering of serum cholesterol, and 7 with the stimulation of the immune system. The most widely studied probiotic bacteria were Lactobacillus GG (22 studies), Lactobacillus acidophilus (16 studies), Bifidobacterium bifidum (6 studies), and Enterococcus faecium (7 studies). Intake of Lactobacillus GG consistently shortened the diarrheal phase of rotavirus infection by 1 d. However, evidence for the prevention by Lactobacillus GG and other probiotics of diarrhea due to viral or bacterial infections was less strong. Effects of probiotics on the immune system are inconclusive because of the variety of outcome variables reported. Cholesterol lowering by L. acidophilus was shown in some but not all studies; cholesterol lowering by E. faecium seems to be transient. Two studies of one research group showed a smaller recurrence of bladder tumors in patients after treatment with Lactobacillus casei; these results await confirmation. The production of mutagens after a meal might be reduced by the concomitant intake of probiotics, but the relevance of this finding is unclear. In conclusion, consumption of foods containing Lactobacillus GG may shorten the course of rotavirus infection. Other health effects of probiotic bacteria have not been well established. Well-designed placebo-controlled studies with validated outcome variables are needed to determine the health effects of probiotics.
TI  - Effects of intestinal bacteria on the development of colonic neoplasm II. Changes in the immunological environment.
AB  - To study the effects of intestinal bacteria on the development of colonic neoplasm, we have established gnotobiotic mice with a single species of intestinal bacteria. In the previous study, the incidence of colonic adenoma induced with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) in the gnotobiotic mice with Lactobacillus acidophilus, gnotobiotic mice with Escherichia coli and germ-free mice were 30, 50 and 74%, respectively. In this study, 7-week-old mice in each group were sacrificed without the administration of DMH to examine the constituents of immuno-competent cells in various mouse organs using flow cytometry. In the gnotobiotic mice, CD3 intermediate interleukin (IL)-2Rbeta positive cells were observed predominantly in the liver. In the gnotobiotic mice with L. acidophilus, Mac-1 positive Gr-1 positive cells were observed predominantly in the colonic lamina propria. The activation of extrathymic T cells in the liver and granulocytes in the colonic mucosa may be related to anti-neoplastic effects of L. acidophilus in this experimental model.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of the addition of lyophilized, heat-killed Lactobacillus acidophilus LB to oral rehydration therapy in the treatment of acute diarrhea in children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Addition of a medication to the World Health Organization protocol for treatment of acute diarrhea in children is controversial. In this trial, the clinical efficacy of a medication (Lacteol Fort sachets; Laboratoire du Lacteol du Docteur Boucard, Houdan France) containing lyophilized heat-killed Lactobacillus acidophilus LB was assessed as an adjunct to oral rehydration therapy. METHODS: Children aged 3 to 24 months with acute diarrhea and mild or moderate dehydration were enrolled in the study. Children received oral rehydration therapy for the first 4 hours. After this first rehydration phase, undiluted milk formula or breast milk was fed alternately with oral rehydration solution. Children were fed rice gruel as tolerated. They received either one sachet containing 10 billion of lyophilized heat-killed L. acidophilus LB or placebo at admission and at 12-hour intervals for five doses. RESULTS: Seventy-three children (37 L. acidophilus LB, 36 placebo) were enrolled, of whom 40 (17 L. acidophilus LB, 23 placebo) received an antibiotic before inclusion. Rotavirus was identified in approximately 50% of the children in each group. After 24 hours of treatment, the number of rotavirus-positive children with watery stools was significantly lower (p = 0.012) in the L. acidophilus LB group. Mean duration of diarrhea was decreased (p = 0.034) with L. acidophilus LB (43.4 hours) versus placebo (57.0 hours). This decreased duration was particularly marked in children with no antibiotic therapy before inclusion (31.1 hours): 42.9 hours for the L. acidophilus LB group versus 74.0 hours for the placebo group (p = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: Addition of L. acidophilus LB to oral rehydration therapy was effective in the treatment of children with acute diarrhea by decreasing the duration of diarrhea.
TI  - New binding assay and preparative trial of cell-surface lectin from Lactobacillus acidophilus group lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - To select Lactobacillus acidophilus group bacteria as a probiotic yogurt starter, we designed a new screening method that measures the binding activity of surface layer protein to rat colonic mucin, which contains sugar chains similar to those in human colonic mucin. The B1 subgroup (Lactobacillus gasseri), which is the dominant strain in the human intestinal tract, showed the highest binding activity to rat colonic mucin among all the subgroups of L. acidophilus. The binding activity of the surface layer protein was also shown to be significantly reduced after periodate oxidation of the rat colonic mucin. This new screening method is useful for rapid selection of L. acidophilus strains that have high adhesion to the human intestinal tract. Lectin-like proteins that were bound to rat colonic mucin were isolated from the surface layer proteins with a rat colonic mucin-coated membrane and were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. A few main bands together with several minor bands were observed on the electrophoretograms obtained from the strains tested. It is possible that those lectin-like proteins contribute to adhesion of the bacterial cell to human colonic mucosa by binding specifically to carbohydrate portions.
TI  - Proinflammatory cytokine and nitric oxide induction in murine macrophages by cell wall and cytoplasmic extracts of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Cells from a number of bacterial genera have been shown to possess mitogenic and  polyclonal activating properties when cultured with cells of the immune system. Based on previously reported health immune-enhancing effects of fermented dairy products, we tested the potentiating effects of representative lactic acid bacteria and their extracts on leukocyte function. Specifically, the effects of in vitro exposure to heat-killed cells of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. casei, L. gasseri, L. helveticus, L. reuteri, and Streptococcus thermophilus, their cell walls, and their cytoplasmic extracts on proliferation as well as cytokine and nitric oxide (NO) production were examined in the RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line. A similar strategy was applied to murine cultures composed of peritoneal, spleen, and Peyer's patch cells. Both the cell wall and cytoplasmic fractions of lactic acid bacteria were able to stimulate cloned macrophages to produce significant amounts of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, (interleukin) IL-6, and NO. Pronounced enhancement of IL-6 production by peritoneal cells was observed when cultured with those extracts, whereas, effects were not noted in spleen and Peyer's patch cell cultures from mice. Based on the results, it appears that, as a group, the lactic acid bacteria were capable of stimulating macrophages and possibly other immune cells to produce cytokines and NO, and both their cell walls and cytoplasm contributed to these capacities.
TI  - Study of adhesion of Lactobacillus casei CRL 431 to ileal intestinal cells of mice.
AB  - It is well known that the cell wall of Lactobacillus casei CRL 431, a strain present in probiotics, presents lectinlike surface molecules. Presence of these molecules stimulates the immune system. Given the role that lectins and lectinlike substances play in the adhesion phenomenon, it is probable that this is an initial stage in the immunostimulation produced by this bacterium. To confirm this, adhesion of this microorganism to exfoliated mouse ileal epithelial cells was studied in vitro. Other L. casei strains isolated from adult human intestines and one of dairy origin were also examined for their ability to adhere to ileal epithelial cells. Another strain, which was included in the present study, was Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 730. L. casei strains isolated from humans showed good ability to adhere to ileal epithelial cells, whereas L. casei isolated from dairy origin did not. Adhesion was only observed at 37 degrees C and at a pH between 6 and 7.5. The exposure time needed for highest adhesion was 30 min. Presence of lectinlike substances on the surface of L. casei CRL 431 is important to this adhesion phenomenon, since adherence capacity was lost after removal of these substances.
TI  - Inhibition of lipid peroxidation by Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium longum.
AB  - The inhibition of lipid peroxidation by Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium longum was investigated using two lipid model systems. All eight strains, including six strains of L. acidophilus and two strains of B. longum, demonstrated an inhibitory effect on linoleic acid peroxidation. The inhibitory rates on linoleic acid peroxidation ranged from 33 to 46% when 1 mL of intracellular cell-free extract was tested. In the second model system, the cell membrane of osteoblast was used as the source for biological lipid. The results indicated that all strains were able to protect biological lipids from oxidation. The inhibition rates on cell membrane lipid peroxidation ranged from 22 to 37%. The effect of L. acidophilus and B. longum on inhibition of fluorescent tissue pigment accumulation was also obtained for osteoblastic cells. The inhibition rates on fluorescent tissue pigment accumulation ranged from 20 to 39%. The antioxidative effect of each milliliter of intracellular cell-free extract of L. acidophilus and B. longum was equivalent to 104-172 ppm of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). These results indicated that all strains demonstrated high antioxidative activity. The scavenging ability of lipid peroxidation products, tert-butyl hydroperoxide and malondialdehyde, was also evaluated. The results showed that L. acidophilus and B. longum were not able to scavenge the tert-butyl hydroperoxide. Nevertheless, malondialdehyde was scavenged well by these strains.
TI  - Growth-inhibiting effects of Coptis japonica root-derived isoquinoline alkaloids  on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The growth-inhibiting activity of Coptis japonica (Makino) root-derived materials toward eight human intestinal bacteria was examined using an impregnated paper disk method and compared to that of four commercially available isoquinoline alkaloids [berberine sulfate (BS), berberine iodide (BI), palmatine chloride (PC), and palmatine sulfate(PS)], as well as that of Thea sinensis leaf-derived epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). The biologically active constituents of the Coptis extract were characterized as the isoquinoline alkaloids berberine chloride (BC), palmatine iodide (PI), and coptisine chloride (CC) by spectral analysis. The growth responses varied with both chemical and bacterial strain used. In a test using 500 microg/disk, BC and PI produced a clear inhibitory effect against Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium paraputrificum, whereas weak or no inhibition was observed in Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Escherichia coli. At 1000 microg/ disk, CC revealed weak or no growth inhibition toward all test bacteria, whereas EGCG exhibited weak growth inhibition against only C. perfringens and C. paraputrificum. Among various isoquinoline alkaloids, BC exhibited more potent inhibitory activity toward C. perfringens than BI and BS, whereas the inhibitory effect was more pronounced in PI compared to PC and PS. The Coptis root-derived materials did not promote growth of B. longum and C. perfringens.
TI  - Differentiation of Lactobacillus isolates from infant faeces by SDS-PAGE and rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes.
AB  - Isolates of lactobacilli from infant faeces phenotypically characterized as Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (six strains), Lact. rhamnosus (six strains), Lact. gasseri (three strains), Lact. acidophilus (one strain) and Lact. fermentum/reuteri (three strains) according to recent classification systems were subjected to SDS-PAGE of whole cell proteins and rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probe hybridization, in order to confirm the phenotypic characterization and elucidate the exact taxonomic position of the three strains that had properties between fermentum and reuteri. Results suggested a good agreement between the phenotypic characterization, SDS-PAGE and rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probe hybridization for strains of all species except for the Lact. fermentum/reuteri strains. Results obtained by rRNA probes suggested a possible phylogenetic relatedness of the strains to Lact. reuteri. Isolates from infant faeces with interesting probiotic properties could be used as components of fermented milk products.
TI  - Supplementation with Lactobacillus reuteri or L. acidophilus reduced intestinal shedding of cryptosporidium parvum oocysts in immunodeficient C57BL/6 mice.
AB  - The effect of L. acidophilus supplementation to reduce fecal shedding of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts was compared to L. reuteri using C57BL/6 female mice immunosuppressed by murine leukemia virus (strain LP-BM5) inoculation. After 12 weeks post LP-BM5 inoculation, 15 immunosuppressed mice each were randomly assinged to one of the following treatment groups: historical control (group A), LP-BM5 control (group B), C. parvum (group C), L. reuteri plus C. parvum (group D) or L. acidophilus plus C. parvum (group E). Mice were pre-fed the L. reuteri or L. acidophilus bacteria strains daily for 13 days, challenged with C. parvum oocysts and thereafter fed the specified Lactobacillus regimens daily during the experimental period. Animals supplemented with L. reuteri shed fewer (p<0.05) oocysts on day-7 post C. parvum challenge compared to controls. Mice supplemented with L. acidophilus also shed fewer (p<0.05) oocysts on days 7 and 14 post-challenge compared to controls. Overall, Lactobacillus supplementation reduced C. parvum shedding in the feces but failed to suppress the production of T-helper type 2 cytokines [interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-8)] which are associated with immunosuppression. Additionally, Lactobacillus supplementation did not restore T-helper type 1 cytokines (interleukin-2 (IL-2) and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), which are required for recovery from parasitic infections. Altered T-helper types 1 and 2 cytokine production as a consequence of immunodysfunction permitted the development of persistent cryptosporidiosis while mice with intact immune system were refractory to infection with C. parvum. Reduction in shedding of oocysts observed in the Lactobacillus supplemented mice during deminished IL-2 and IFN-gamma production may be mediated by factors released into the intestinal lumen by the Lactobacillus and possibly other host cellular mechanisms. These observations suggest that L. reuteri or L. acidophilus can reduce C. parvum parasite burdens in the intestinal epithelium during cryptosporidiosis and may serve potential benefits as probiotics for host resistance to intestinal parasitic infections. L. acidophilus was more efficacious in reducing fecal shedding than L. reuteri and therefore may also have implication in the therapy of cryptosporidiosis during immunosuppressive states including human AIDS.
TI  - Molecular analysis of the microbial diversity present in the colonic wall, colonic lumen, and cecal lumen of a pig.
AB  - Random clones of 16S ribosomal DNA gene sequences were isolated after PCR amplification with eubacterial primers from total genomic DNA recovered from samples of the colonic lumen, colonic wall, and cecal lumen from a pig. Sequences were also obtained for cultures isolated anaerobically from the same colonic-wall sample. Phylogenetic analysis showed that many sequences were related to those of Lactobacillus or Streptococcus spp. or fell into clusters IX, XIVa, and XI of gram-positive bacteria. In addition, 59% of randomly cloned sequences showed less than 95% similarity to database entries or sequences from cultivated organisms. Cultivation bias is also suggested by the fact that the majority of isolates (54%) recovered from the colon wall by culturing were related to Lactobacillus and Streptococcus, whereas this group accounted for only one-third of the sequence variation for the same sample from random cloning. The remaining cultured isolates were mainly Selenomonas related. A higher proportion of Lactobacillus reuteri-related sequences than of Lactobacillus acidophilus- and Lactobacillus amylovorus-related sequences were present in the colonic-wall sample. Since the majority of bacterial ribosomal sequences recovered from the colon wall are less than 95% related to known organisms, the roles of many of the predominant wall-associated bacteria remain to be defined.
TI  - Reduced incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis associated with enteral administration of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium infantis to neonates in an intensive care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) has been associated with a wide variety of bacteria and their cytotoxins. The content and the nature of gut bacterial colonization in newborns that require intensive care hospitalization has been demonstrated to be abnormal. In the 25-bed neonatal intensive care unit in Hospital Simon Bolivar, in Bogota, Colombia, cases of NEC are common causes of morbidity and mortality. This article examines the hypothesis that oral administration of prophylactic Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium infantis to all neonates in an intensive care unit, would decrease the incidence of NEC. METHODS: Daily doses of 250 million live L. acidophilus and 250 million B. infantis were given to all 1237 newborns (both inpatients and transfer patients) admitted to the unit during 1 year, until they were discharged from the hospital. In this study, 1282 patients hospitalized during the previous year were used as controls. RESULTS: There were no complications attributed to the daily administration of L. acidophilus and B. infantis. The study groups were compared for place of origin, clinical, and demographic variables, and there was no statistically significant difference in those variables. In the historic control group, there were 85 NEC cases compared to 34 cases in the group that received probiotic prophylaxis (P < 0.0002). In the historic control group, there were 35 NEC-associated fatalities compared to 14 fatalities in the group that received probiotic prophylaxis (P < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The positive results in this study support the need for further investigation of bacterial colonization and its role in NEC.
TI  - Antioxidative ability of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Nineteen strains of lactic acid bacteria were investigated for antioxidative activity. These includedLactobacillus acidophilus B, E, N1, 4356, LA-1, and Farr; Lactobacillus bulgaricus 12 278, 448, 449, Lb, 1006, and 11 842; Streptococcus thermophilus 821, MC, 573, 3641, and 19 987; and Bifidobacterium longum B6 and 15 708. Intracellular cell-free extract of all strains demonstrated antioxidative activity with inhibition rates of ascorbate autoxidation in the range of 7-12%. Antioxidative mechanisms including metal ion chelating ability, scavenge of reactive oxygen species, enzyme inhibition, and reducing activity of intracellular cell-free extract of lactic acid bacteria were studied. S. thermophilus 821 had the highest metal ion chelating ability for Fe(2+), and B. longum 15 708 showed the highest Cu(2+) chelating ability among the 19 strains tested. All strains demonstrated reactive oxygen species scavenging ability. L. acidophilus E showed the highest hydroxyl radical scavenging ability, and B. longum B6 had the best hydrogen peroxide scavenging ability. Reducing activity was also found in all strains. Most of the strains tested demonstrated excellent reducing activity. B. longum B6 showed the highest reducing activity among the 19 strains tested. In enzyme inhibition, superoxide dismutase activity was not found in these 19 strains, and the activity of superoxide dismutase was not induced when metal ion Mn(2+), Fe(2+), or Cu(2+)Zn(2+) was present.
TI  - The identification of vaginal Lactobacillus species and the demographic and microbiologic characteristics of women colonized by these species.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus has been reported to be the predominant vaginal species. Vaginal lactobacilli isolated from 215 sexually active women were identified using whole-chromosomal DNA probes to 20 American Type Culture Collection Lactobacillus strains. Most women were colonized by L. crispatus (32%), followed by L. jensenii (23%), a previously undescribed species designated L. 1086V (15%), L. gasseri (5%), L. fermentum (0.3%), L. oris (0.3%), L. reuteri (0.3%), L. ruminis (0.3%), and L. vaginalis (0.3%). H2O2 was produced by 95% of L. crispatus and 94% of L. jensenii isolates, compared with only 9% of L. 1086V. Colonization by L. crispatus or L. jensenii was positively associated with being white (P<.001), age >/=20 years (P=.05), barrier contraceptive usage (P=.008), and lower frequency of bacterial vaginosis (P<.001) and gonorrhea (P=.03). L. crispatus and L. jensenii, not L. acidophilus, are the most common species of vaginal lactobacilli.
TI  - Molecular identification of potentially probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  - The rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes are useful for the identification of Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. gasseri, L. johnsonii, L. crispatus, and L. amylovorus. However, the oligonucleotide probe designed for L. helveticus hybridized with nucleic acids of type strains of L. gallinarum and L. helveticus. Hence, the similarity among the 73 strains of lactobacilli was evaluated on the basis of their randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) profiles derived from five single-primer reactions. These strains were grouped into seven clusters at a similarity level of 30%, which corresponded to six separate species of the L. acidophilus complex (L. johnsonii, L. gallinarum, L. amylovorus, L. crispatus, L. acidophilus, and L. gasseri, respectively) and L. helveticus. For the first time, strains of L. gallinarum were characterized by RAPD and PFGE analyses. The genome length in that species was estimated to be near 1.45 Mb with the summation of ApaI fragments, and near 1.95 Mb with the summation of SmaI fragments.
TI  - Antiproliferative effects of homogenates derived from five strains of candidate probiotic bacteria.
AB  - Unheated and heat-treated homogenates were separately prepared from candidate probiotic bacteria, including Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Bifidobacterium lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. We compared the phytohemagglutinin-induced proliferation of mononuclear cells in the presence of homogenates and in the presence of a control containing no homogenate by assessing thymidine incorporation in cell cultures. All homogenates suppressed proliferation, whether the enzymatic activity was inactivated or not inactivated by heating. When the proliferation assays were repeated with cytoplasmic and cell wall extracts derived from the homogenate of L. rhamnosus GG, the cytoplasmic extract but not the cell wall extract was suppressive. These findings indicate that candidate probiotic bacteria possess a heat-stable antiproliferative component(s). These bacteria may be used to generate microbiologically nonviable yet immunologically active probiotic food products that are easier to store and have a longer shelf life.
TI  - The effect of orally administered viable probiotic and dairy lactobacilli on mouse lymphocyte proliferation.
AB  - Four common Lactobacillus strains were screened for their effects on proliferation of mouse splenic lymphocytes. Mice received perorally 10(9) viable bacteria kg(-1) body weight for 7 days. Lactobacillus acidophilus treatment enhanced ex vivo basal proliferation (by 43%) and B-cell response at suboptimal and optimal concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (by 27-28%). Conversely, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus rhamnosus inhibited both basal proliferation (by 14-51%) and mitogen-stimulated lymphoproliferation, particularly at supra-optimal concentrations of concanavalin A (by 43-68%) and LPS (by 23-62%). Therefore, these Lactobacillus strains demonstrate strain-specific effects on B- and T-cells and may also alter the splenocyte sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of mitogens.
TI  - The effect of suboptimal growth temperature and growth phase on resistance of lactobacillus acidophilus to environmental stress
AB  - This paper describes the effect of growth temperature and the physiological age of Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 639 on the development of cross resistance to different kinds of environmental stress. Exponential-phase cells growing at 25 degrees C and stationary-phase cells (8- and 11-h-old cultures at the optimal temperature of 37 degrees C) showed the highest survival and metabolic activity after challenge by freezing, heating, osmotic stress, and exposure to ethanol, peroxide, or acid. One-dimensional SDS-PAGE gels showed overexpression of three proteins (22.5, 39.6, and 49.2 kDa) at 25 degrees C, of two proteins (40.9 and 48.3 kDa) in 8-h-old cultures, and of one protein (30.3 kDa) after glucose depletion in 11-h-old cultures. These results strongly suggest the involvement of different sets of protein in the cellular processes of adaptation to environmental changes. Copyright 1999 Academic Press.
TI  - Characterization and production of amylovorin L471, a bacteriocin purified from Lactobacillus amylovorus DCE 471 by a novel three-step method.
AB  - The strongly hydrophobic bacteriocin amylovorin L471 from Lactobacillus amylovorus DCE 471 was isolated and purified to homogeneity from complex culture broth by a novel, rapid and simple three-step protocol including (i) ammonium sulphate precipitation, (ii) chloroform/methanol extraction/precipitation and (iii) reversed-phase HPLC, the only chromatographic step involved. The molecular mass of the peptide was determined to be 4876.9 Da by electrospray mass spectrometric analysis. N-terminal amino acid sequencing identified 35 amino acid residues as being identical to the N-terminal sequence of lactobin A, a bacteriocin from another L. amylovorus strain. These non-identical strains produce bacteriocins that display small differences in molecular mass and inhibitory spectrum. The amino acid sequence of amylovorin L471 shared significant homology with lactacin X, one of the two bactericidal peptides produced by Lactobacillus johnsonii VPI11088. A purified amylovorin L471 preparation permitted confirmation of the inhibitory spectrum previously established with a crude extract. It displayed a bactericidal mode of action on lactobacilli after an extremely rapid adsorption to the target cells. Two Listeria spp. were only weakly sensitive. Amylovorin L471 appears to be produced constitutively. Ethanol not only stimulated specific bacteriocin production but also prevented adsorption of the bacteriocin molecules to the producer cells upon prolonged fermentation. The latter result supports the hypothesis that the apparent inactivation of bacteriocin observed during the stationary phase of batch fermentations is due to adsorption.
TI  - Efficiency of transcription from promoter sequence variants in Lactobacillus is both strain and context dependent.
AB  - The introduction of consensus -35 (TTGACA) and -10 (TATAAT) hexamers and a TG motif into the Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 wild-type slpA promoter resulted in significant improvements (4.3-, 4.1-, and 10.7-fold, respectively) in transcriptional activity in Lactobacillus fermentum BR11. In contrast, the same changes resulted in decreased transcription in Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The TG motif was shown to be important in the context of weak -35 and -10 hexamers (L. fermentum BR11) or a consensus -10 hexamer (L. rhamnosus GG). Thus, both strain- and context-dependent effects are critical factors influencing transcription in Lactobacillus.
TI  - Identification of the pH-inducible, proton-translocating F1F0-ATPase (atpBEFHAGDC) operon of Lactobacillus acidophilus by differential display: gene structure, cloning and characterization.
AB  - The influence of low pH on inducible gene expression in Lactobacillus acidophilus was investigated by the use of differential display. Logarithmic phase cultures were exposed to pH 3.5 for various intervals, and RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed. The resultant cDNAs were subjected to PCR and the products were resolved by electrophoresis. Several cDNA products were induced after exposure to pH 3.5. One of these products, a 0.7 kb fragment, showed sequence similarity to bacterial atpBEF genes of the atp operon, whose genes encode the various subunits of the F1F0-ATPase. With the 0.7 kb differential display product as a probe, hybridizations with total RNA from untreated and acid-treated L. acidophilus verified the acid inducibility of this operon. The increase in atp mRNA induced by low pH was accompanied by an increase in the activity of the enzyme in membrane extracts. The full-length atp operon was sequenced, and its genes were in the order of atpBEFHAGDC, coding for the a, c, b, delta, alpha, gamma, beta and epsilon subunits respectively. The operon contained no i gene, but was preceded by a 122 bp intergenic space, which contained putative extended -10 and -35 promoter regions. Primer extension analysis of RNA from cultures that were shifted from pH 5.6 to pH 3. 5, and held for 0, 30 or 45 min, revealed that the transcriptional start site did not change position as a function of culture pH or time after exposure to pH 3.5. The primary structure and genetic organization indicated that the H+-ATPase of L. acidophilus is a typical F1F0-type ATPase. The similarity to streptococcal ATPases and the acid inducibility of this operon suggest that it may function in the ATP-dependent extrusion of protons and maintenance of cytoplasmic pH. Finally, the use of differential display RT-PCR was an effective approach to identify genes in L. acidophilus induced by an environmental stimulus.
TI  - D-lactic acidosis in short bowel syndrome.
AB  - Short bowel syndrome can present many complex management issues and may be complicated by various metabolic problems. D-lactic acidosis in the setting of short bowel syndrome has been described only rarely in children. A further case is presented with a review of typical clinical manifestations of D-lactic acidosis and reported management options. Early recognition and appropriate management is essential to avoid morbidity secondary to this complication of short bowel syndrome. Probiotic therapies may have an increasing role in prevention and management of this complication.
TI  - Purification and characterization of an arylamine N-acetyltransferase from Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - N-acetyltransferase from Lactobacillus acidophilus was purified by ultrafiltration, DEAE-Sephacel, gel filtration chromatography on Sephadex G-100, and DEAE-5pw on high performance liquid chromatography, as judged by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) on a 12% (w/v) slab gel. The purified enzyme was thermostable at 37 degrees C for 1 h with a half-life of 32 min at 37 degrees C, and displayed optimum activity at 37 degrees C and pH 7.0. The K(m) and Vmax values for 2-aminofluorene were 0.842 mM and 2.406 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively. Among a series of divalent cations and salts, Zn2+, Ca2+, Fe2+, Mg2+, and Cu2+ were demonstrated to be the most potent inhibitors. The enzyme had a molecular mass of 44.9 kD. The three chemical modification agents, iodoacetamide, phenylglyoxal, and diethylpyrocarbonate, all exhibited dose-, time-, and temperature-dependent inhibition effects. Preincubation of purified N-acetyltransferase with acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) provided significant protection against the inhibition of iodoacetamide and diethylpyrocarbonate, but only partial protection against the inhibition of phenylglyoxal. These results indicate that cysteine, histidine, and arginine residues are essential for this bacterial activity, and the first two are likely to reside on the AcCoA binding site, but the arginine residue may be located close to the AcCoA binding site. This report is the first demonstration of acetyl CoA:arylamine N-acetyltransferase in L. acidophilus.

TI  - Effects of intestinal bacteria on the development of colonic neoplasm: an experimental study.
AB  - Effects of intestinal microflora on the development of colonic neoplasm induced by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) were observed using conventionalized and gnotobiotic mouse models. The incidence of colonic adenoma in germ-free mice (IQI/jic) (GF), mice conventionalized after DMH injection (Cvz-post-DMH) and conventionalized mice (Cvz, conventionalized before DMH injection) was 74%, 69% and 58%, respectively. The mean number of adenomas per mouse in the three groups was 2.6, 2.0 and 1.4, respectively. However, the adenoma in Cvz was larger than in GF. The incidence of adenoma in mice mono-associated with Mitsuokella multiacida, Clostridium butyricum, Bifidobacterium longum, Clostridium paraputrificum, Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus acidophilus was 68%, 68%, 63%, 50%, 50% and 30%, respectively. However, the adenoma in the Cl. paraputrificum group and the Cl. butyricum group was larger than in GF. Faecal pH in Cvz and the L. acidophilus group was significantly lower than in GF. The deconjugation rate of faecal bile acids in Cvz, the Cl. paraputrificum group and the Cl. butyricum group was significantly higher than in GF. These findings suggested two different effects of microflora on the development of DMH-induced adenoma: either an inhibition of the incidence of adenoma or a promotion of tumour growth. Effects of L. acidophilus may be mediated by faecal pH and effects of Cl. paraputrificum and Cl. butyricum by deconjugated bile acids.
TI  - Effect on the cholesterol content of fresh lamb of supplementing the feed of Awassi ewes and lambs with Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Lactating ewes and their lambs were provided daily with two enteric capsules of a freeze-dried culture of selected strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus (1x10(9) colony-forming-units/dose), along with their normal diets, for a period of 120 days. Initially, the supplementation had a significant effect on the serum cholesterol levels of the suckling lambs, but the benefit was reduced after weaning. On slaughter at 120 days, the mean cholesterol concentrations in three cuts of lamb meat were reduced by over 20%, and that in the liver by approximately 18%. In the Middle East where the consumption of lamb is high, this reduction could be beneficial for the consumer, and it is suggested that the potential value of probiotic cultures in ruminant nutrition merits further attention.
TI  - Antagonistic activity of bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus species from ogi,  an indigenous fermented food.
AB  - Seven Lactobacillus species each with one or more strains were isolated from various fermented cereal gruel's (ogi). They were identified as L. plantarum (3 strains), L. delbrueckii (1 strain), L. brevis (2 strains), L. reuteri (2 strains), L. casei (1 strain), L. fermentum (1 strain) and L. acidophilus (1 strain). Bacteriocin production was observed in cell-free supernatants of 8 of these strains with L. fermentum, L. delbrueckii and L. reuteri strains (white maize ogi) being negative. The bacteriocin produced by the eight strains inhibited the growth of various target organisms with the inhibition strongly noticed using Enterococcus faecalis as indicator. While catalase treatment, pH changes and heat treatment up to 80 degrees C had no effect on the activity of bacteriocin from these isolates, treatment with trypsin and proteinase K resulted in complete loss of inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins. A reduction in the inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins was also found to occur with increasing concentrations of glucose or peptone in the cultivation medium.
TI  - Phylogeny of the defined murine microbiota: altered Schaedler flora.
AB  - The "altered Schaedler flora" (ASF) was developed for colonizing germfree rodents with a standardized microbiota. The purpose of this study was to identify each of the eight ASF strains by 16S rRNA sequence analysis. Three strains were previously identified as Lactobacillus acidophilus (strain ASF 360), Lactobacillus salivarius (strain ASF 361), and Bacteroides distasonis (strain ASF 519) based on phenotypic criteria. 16S rRNA analysis indicated that each of the strains differed from its presumptive identity. The 16S rRNA sequence of strain ASF 361 is essentially identical to the 16S rRNA sequences of the type strains of Lactobacillus murinis and Lactobacillus animalis (both isolated from mice), and all of these strains probably belong to a single species. Strain ASF 360 is a novel lactobacillus that clusters with L. acidophilus and Lactobacillus lactis. Strain ASF 519 falls into an unnamed genus containing [Bacteroides] distasonis, [Bacteroides] merdae, [Bacteroides] forsythus, and CDC group DF-3. This unnamed genus is in the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides phylum and is most closely related to the genus Porphyromonas. The spiral-shaped strain, strain ASF 457, is in the Flexistipes phylum and exhibits sequence identity with rodent isolates of Robertson. The remaining four ASF strains, which are extremely oxygen-sensitive fusiform bacteria, group phylogenetically with the low-G+C-content gram-positive bacteria (Firmicutes, Bacillus-Clostridium group). ASF 356, ASF 492, and ASF 502 fall into Clostridium cluster XIV of Collins et al. Morphologically, ASF 492 resembles members of this cluster, Roseburia cecicola, and Eubacterium plexicaudatum. The 16S rRNA sequence of ASF 492 is identical to that of E. plexicaudatum. Since the type strain and other viable original isolates of E. plexicaudatum have been lost, strain ASF 492 is a candidate for a neotype strain. Strain ASF 500 branches deeply in the low-G+C-content gram-positive phylogenetic tree but is not closely related to any organisms whose 16S rRNA sequences are currently in the GenBank database. The 16S rRNA sequence information determined in the present study should allow rapid identification of ASF strains and should permit detailed analysis of the interactions of ASF organisms during development of intestinal disease in mice that are coinfected with a variety of pathogenic microorganisms.
TI  - Experimental study of the influence of intestinal flora on the healing of intestinal anastomoses.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The beneficial effects of the normal intestinal flora on wound healing in the skin have already been confirmed, and this study attempted to elucidate the influence of the intestinal flora on the healing process in intestinal anastomoses. METHODS: Five groups of rats were studied: germ-free, conventional, monocontaminated with Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 or Escherichia coli X7 and ex-germ-free (conventionalized). All animals underwent ileal and colonic resections followed by anastomoses. Seven days later they were killed and the bursting pressure and hydroxyproline concentration of the anastomoses were measured. The microbiological status of the animals was confirmed weekly. RESULTS: No bacteria were detected in the germ-free rats and no other bacteria were found in the monocontaminated animals. Conventional rats had a significantly higher anastomotic bursting pressure both in the ileum compared with rats monocontaminated with L. acidophilus, and in the colon compared with germ-free rats. The ex-germ-free rats also showed a significantly higher bursting pressure than germ-free animals and rats monocontaminated with either L. acidophilus or E. coli in the ileum and colon. CONCLUSION: The presence of the intestinal flora enhanced the healing of intestinal anastomoses. The data suggest that this effect depends on differences in the types of bacteria in the intestine.
TI  - Effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus and zinc bacitracin as dietary additives for  broiler chickens.
AB  - The influence of Lactobacillus acidophilus and zinc bacitracin alone, or in combination, on the growth of broiler chickens was monitored over a period of 8 weeks. 2. The maximum improvement in body weight over the controls was 10.8% with both additives in the diet but the use of bacitracin alone induced a 9.1% improvement. 3. Food conversion was reduced by zinc bacitracin alone but was improved by the use of L. acidophilus and bacitracin in combination. 4. The combination treatment increased abdominal fat deposition in the female chickens by 31%.
TI  - Study of the possible mechanisms involved in the mucosal immune system activation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The induction of a mucosal immune response is not easy due to the development of  oral tolerance, but under some conditions, bacteria can activate this immune system. Antigens administered orally can interact with M cells of Peyer's patches or bind to the epithelial cells. We have demonstrated that certain lactic acid bacteria are able to induce specific secretory immunity, and others will enhance the gut inflammatory immune response. The aim of this work was to establish the reason for these different behaviors and to define possible mechanisms involved in the interaction of lactic acid bacteria at the intestinal level. We studied IgA+ and IgM+ B cells comparatively in bronchus and intestine and CD4+ T cells and IgA anti-lactic acid bacteria antibodies in the intestinal fluid, induced by oral administration of Lactobacillus casei, Lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lb. acidophilus, Lb. plantarum, Lb. rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis, and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. The increase in the IgA+ B cells in the bronchus means that these lactic acid bacteria were able to induce the IgA cycle by interaction with M cells from Peyer's patches or intestinal epithelial cells. The IgM+ cells increased when the stimulus did not induce the switch from IgM+ to IgA+. The increase in the CD4+ cells suggests interaction of Peyer's patches and enhancement of the B- and T-cell migration. The anti-lactic acid bacteria antibody is related to the processing and presentation of the microorganisms to the immune cells. We demonstrated that Lb. casei and Lb. plantarum were able to interact with Peyer's patch cells and showed an increase in IgA-, CD4+ cells, and antibodies specific for the stimulating strain. Lactobacillus acidophilus induced gut mucosal activation by interaction with the epithelial cells without increase in the immune cells associated with the bronchus. Although Lb. rhamnosus and Strep. salivarius ssp. thermophilus interact with epithelial cells, they also induced an immune response against their epitopes. Lactococcus lactis and Lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus induced an increase of IgA+ cells entering the IgA cycle but not CD4+ cells; thus, these bacteria would have been bound to epithelial cells that activated B lymphocytes without processing and presenting of their epitopes. We did not determine specific antibodies against Lc. lactis or Lb. bulgaricus.
TI  - Isolation and identification of lactobacilli from novel-type probiotic and mild yoghurts and their stability during refrigerated storage.
AB  - A total of 26 Lactobacillus strains were isolated from various mild yoghurts and  novel-type probiotic dairy products and from a starter culture preparation and were identified by using DNA-DNA hybridization technique. The species present in those products were found to be Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. johnsonii, L. crispatus, L. casei, L. paracasei and L. rhamnosus. DNA homology analysis revealed that some strains had been misclassified by their investigators. Three strains designated as L. acidophilus (L. acidophilus LA-1, L. acidophilus ATCC 43121 and the Lactobacillus strain from Biogarde culture) were found to belong to L. johnsonii and L. acidophilus L1 to be L. crispatus. Strains designated as L. casei were found to be members of three separate species: L. casei, L. paracasei and L. rhamnosus. Viable numbers of lactobacilli in mild and probiotic yoghurts varied greatly including some products with very low Lactobacillus counts. The majority of the probiotic yoghurts, however, contained viable counts above 10(5) per g even at the end of the best before use period.
TI  - Effects of a mixture of organisms, Lactobacillus acidophilus or Streptococcus faecalis on delta6-desaturase activity in the livers of rats fed a fat- and cholesterol-enriched diet.
AB  - The effect of a mixture of organisms (a probiotic mixture) comprising Bacillus, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Clostridium, Saccharomyces, and Candida (10(7-8) colony-forming units/g rice bran of each component) on delta6-desaturase activity in liver microsomes was compared with those of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Streptococcus faecalis. There were four treatment groups. Each group of these rats received rice bran (control), the mixture of organisms, L. acidophilus, or S. faecalis (30 g/kg) along with a fat- and cholesterol-enriched diet for 4 wk. The serum total cholesterol concentration of the group fed the mixture of organisms was reduced by 15-33% compared with the other groups at the end of the 4-wk feeding period (P<0.05). The proportion of palmitic acid in the serum phosphatidylcholine (PC) for the control group was significantly higher than those of the other groups. The proportion of arachidonic acid in the serum PC for the mixed-organism group was also significantly higher than those of the other groups. The proportion of arachidonic acid in the liver PC for the mixed-organism group was significantly higher than those of the control and S. faecalis groups. The ratio of arachidonic acid/linoleic acid was significantly higher in the liver PC of rats fed the mixed organisms compared with the control group (P<0.05). The delta6-desaturase activity in the liver microsomal fraction of the mixed-organism group was significantly higher than those of the other groups. The delta6-desaturase activity correlated positively with the ratio of arachidonic acid/linoleic acid of liver PC, the correlation coefficient (r) being 0.819 (P<0.001). The results indicate that the effect of the mixture of organisms was to increase delta6-desaturase activity and serum arachidonic acid and decrease cholesterol compared to the other organisms and control, but the mechanism whereby the enzyme activity was related to serum cholesterol does not appear to have been explored.
TI  - Effect of whey-based culture supernatant of Lactobacillus acidophilus (johnsonii) La1 on Helicobacter pylori infection in humans.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Specific strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus are known to inhibit intestinal cell adhesion and invasion by enterovirulent bacteria. As L. acidophilus can survive transiently in the human stomach, it may downregulate Helicobacter pylori infection. METHODS: The ability of L. acidophilus (johnsonii) La1 supernatant to interfere with H. pylori bacterial growth, urease activity, and adhesion to epithelial cells was tested in vitro. Its effect on H. pylori infection in volunteers was monitored in a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial, using a drinkable, whey-based, La1 culture supernatant. H. pylori infected volunteers were treated 14 days with 50 ml of La1 supernatant four times a day combined with either omeprazole 20 mg four times a day or with placebo. Infection was assessed by breath test, endoscopy, and biopsy sampling, performed at inclusion, immediately at the end of the treatment (breath test only), and 4 weeks after the end of the treatment. RESULTS: La1 supernatant inhibited H. pylori growth in vitro, regardless of previous binding of H. pylori to epithelial cells. In 20 subjects (8 females, 12 males, mean age 33.1 years) a marked decrease in breath test values was observed immediately after treatment with La1 supernatant, both in the omeprazole and in the placebo group (median 12.3 vs. 28.8 and 9.4 vs. 20.4, respectively; p < 0.03). In both treatment groups, breath test values remained low 6 weeks after treatment (omeprazole treated 19.2, placebo treated 8. 3; p < 0.03 vs. pretreatment), but the persistence of H. pylori infection was confirmed in gastric biopsies. CONCLUSION: La1 culture supernatant shown to be effective in vitro has a partial, acid-independent long-term suppressive effect on H. pylori in humans.
TI  - Modulation of nonspecific mechanisms of defense by lactic acid bacteria: effective dose.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a fermented milk product containing Lactobacillus johnsonii La1 (formerly known as Lactobacillus acidophilus La1) on the phagocytic activity of peripheral blood leukocytes in healthy adult volunteers. Furthermore, we sought to define the effective doses of the bacteria, examine the effect on respiratory burst activity, and, finally, examine the contribution made by the starter culture to the biological effects. Volunteers were randomly distributed among three groups; each subject received one pot (150 ml) of fermented milk each day for 3 wk. The first two groups received a freshly prepared product fermented by Streptococcus thermophilus (group A) alone or S. thermophilus and 10(7) cfu/ml L. johnsonii La1 (group B). Group C received a product stored for a period of 21 to 28 d and that contained S. thermophilus and 10(6) cfu/ml of L. johnsonii La1. Ingestion of L. johnsonii La1 did not significantly increase fecal lactobacilli counts. However, L. johnsonii La1 was able to survive intestinal transit and was only recovered from the feces of the volunteers of groups B and C. The fermented base alone showed a weak effect on respiratory burst but not on phagocytic activity. However, the product containing 10(7) cfu/ml L. johnsonii La1 significantly enhanced both functions. The product containing 10(6) cfu/ml of L. johnsonii La1 had no significant effect on either function. These results suggest that fecal persistence may not necessarily reflect in vivo colonization and may not be a prerequisite for all forms of immune reactivity.
TI  - Yoghurt enriched with Lactobacillus acidophilus does not lower blood lipids in healthy men and women with normal to borderline high serum cholesterol levels.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether intake of Lactobacillus acidophilus strain L-1  lowers serum cholesterol in healthy men and women. DESIGN: Randomised, placebo-controlled parallel trial. SETTING: Subjects were free-living. Blood sampling and distribution of yoghurts were administered at a local hospital. SUBJECTS: Seventy-eight adult men and women with cholesterol levels of 3.9-7.8 mmol/L (mean +/- s.d., 5.4+/-0.7). INTERVENTIONS: Subjects consumed 500 mL of control yoghurt daily for two weeks. They were then randomly allocated to receive 500 mL per day of control yoghurt or of yoghurt enriched with Lactobacillus acidophilus L-1 for another six weeks. The yoghurts were spiked with a trace of lithium; compliance as assessed by plasma lithium was excellent. RESULTS: Energy and nutrient intake was constant, and identical for the two groups. Mean body weight was stable. Baseline blood lipid concentrations in the control and treatment groups were highly similar. The effect of consumption of Lactobacillus acidophilus L-1 vs. control on total cholesterol was -0.02 mmol/L (95% CI, -0.18-0.15) after three weeks and 0.04 mmol/L (95% CI, -0.12-0.20) after six weeks. Serum LDL and HDL-cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels were also unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: Yoghurt enriched with Lactobacillus acidophilus L-1 does not lower serum cholesterol in men and women with normal to borderline high cholesterol levels.
TI  - Ingestion of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium to potentiate immunoglobulin A responses to cholera toxin in mice.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria have been reported to have benefits for the prevention and treatment of some forms of diarrhea and related conditions. To determine whether these effects might involve direct stimulation of the gastrointestinal immune response, we administered yogurt to try to enhance mucosal and systemic antibodies against an orally presented immunogen, cholera toxin. Yogurts were manufactured with starter cultures containing different species and strains of lactic acid bacteria. Mice were fed these yogurts for 3 wk, during which they were also orally immunized twice with 10 micrograms of cholera toxin. Blood was collected on d 0 and 21, and fecal pellets were collected weekly. Mice that were immunized orally with cholera toxin responded by producing specific intestinal and serum immunoglobulin (Ig)A anti-cholera toxin. Antibody responses of the IgA isotype were significantly increased in mice fed yogurts made with starters containing the conventional yogurt bacteria Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus supplemented with Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Bifidobacterium infantis. Yogurt that was manufactured with starters containing only conventional yogurt bacteria produced less IgA anti-cholera toxin than did the control group fed nonfat dry milk. Although strong responses were also observed for IgG anti-cholera toxin in serum, the responses did not differ among groups. Thus, administration of yogurt supplemented with L. acidophilus and Bifidobacterium spp. enhanced mucosal and systemic IgA responses to the cholera toxin immunogen.
TI  - Prevention of colonic preneoplastic lesions by the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFMTM in F344 rats.
AB  - The experiments described here were aimed at developing novel probiotic strains that may aid in the reduction of colon cancer risk. We assessed the potential anticancer properties of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFMTM in male F344 rats using inhibition of the formation of azoxymethane (AOM)-induced aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in the colon as the measure of preventive efficacy. At 6 weeks of age, groups of rats were fed the experimental diets containing 0, 2% or 4% lyophilized cultures of L. acidophilus NCFMTM. At 7 weeks of age, all animals in each dietary group, except the vehicle-treated rats, were s.c. injected with AOM (15 mg/kg body weight) once weekly for two weeks. The vehicle-treated groups were given s.c. injections of normal saline. All rats were necropsied 10 weeks after the last AOM injection and ACF in formalin-fixed, methylene blue-stained colonic tissues were counted under the light microscope. The contents of the cecum were analyzed for bacterial beta-glucuronidase activity. Diet supplementation with the probiotic strain NCFMTM significantly suppressed AOM-induction of colonic ACF, in terms of total number, as well as crypt multiplicity and number of ACF/cm2 colon (P<0.01 - 0.001). NCFMTM inhibited AOM-induced colonic ACF formation in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.01). A significant dose-dependent reduction of cecal beta-glucuronidase activities was observed in the rats fed 2% (P<0.04) and 4% (P<0.0001) NCFMTM. These results suggest that Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFMTM may potentially prevent colon cancer development. Further studies are warranted to determine the full potential of this probiotic strain in preclinical efficacy studies.
TI  - Human ileostomy glycoproteins as a model for small intestinal mucus to investigate adhesion of probiotics.
AB  - Human ileostomy glycoproteins were used as a model for small intestinal mucus to  investigate the adhesion of 12 Lactobacillus strains, one Lactococcus strain and one Propionibacterium strain, Both probiotic and dairy strains were tested. Adhesive and non-adhesive Escherichia coli strains were used as controls. All the strains were also tested for their adhesion to polystyrene. Adhesion to ileostomy glycoproteins and to polystyrene varied significantly among the strains tested. Lactobacillus rhamnosus (human isolate), Lactobacillus GG, Lact. acidophilus 1 and P. freudenreichii adhered to ileostomy glycoproteins. Adhesion was concentration-dependent and the most adhesive strains were able to saturate the substratum. These results indicate that human ileostomy glycoproteins can be used as a model system to select potential probiotic strains to complement the adhesion test with intestinal cell lines.
TI  - Bile salt hydrolase activity of three strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Three strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, two from human intestinal origin (016 and L1) and one from porcine intestinal origin (ATCC 43121), were tested for their bile salt deconjugation activity. The L. acidophilus ATCC 43121 had more deconjugating activity of both sodium glycocholate and sodium taurocholate at pH 6.5 than did either L. acidophilus 016 or L1. The activity of intracellular bile salt hydrolase found in strain ATCC 43121 was 14-fold higher than that in either of the other two strains. The optimum pH for deconjugation of sodium glycocholate was between 4 and 5.5 for all three strains. For deconjugation of sodium taurocholate, the optimum pH was between 3.5 and 4.5 for strains L1 and ATCC 43121 and was between pH 5 and 6 for strain O16. The molecular mass of the enzyme in all three strains of L. acidophilus was estimated to be 126 kDa by Sephadex G-200 gel filtration. All three strains exhibited more bile salt hydrolase activity towards sodium glycocholate than towards sodium taurocholate.
TI  - Measurement of bile salt hydrolase activity from Lactobacillus acidophilus based  on disappearance of conjugated bile salts.
AB  - Bile salt hydrolase activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus was measured based on the disappearance of sodium glycocholate and sodium taurocholate from the reaction mixture using HPLC. The amount of sodium glycocholate and sodium taurocholate that disappeared was proportional to the amount of sodium cholate that appeared in the mixture as detected by HPLC. Sodium glycocholate did not precipitate at the enzyme reaction conditions (37 degrees C and pH 5.4) for determining bile salt hydrolase activity. The bile salt hydrolase assay was insensitive to low oxidation-reduction potential when measuring bile salt hydrolase from L. acidophilus, an intestinal microorganism. However, EDTA and freezing temperatures were necessary to maintain stability of the partially purified enzyme during storage.
TI  - [Effectiveness of acipole in prevention of enteric dysbacteriosis due to antibacterial therapy].
AB  - Acipole (Lactobacillus acidophilus + Kefir greins) was used to manage antibiotic  dysbacteriosis as an adverse reaction of antibacterial therapy. 120 patients treated with antibacterial drugs for acute pneumonia and exacerbations of chronic bronchitis were observed. 54 of them were treated under the routine regimen with antibiotics and 66 were additionally treated with the eubiotic acipole: 1 tablet (5 doses) 3 times a day 30 minutes before meal. Routine bacteriological examination of the feces was applied to all the patients. High frequency of bacteriologically revealed dysbacteriosis was stated. The therapy under the antibiotic + acipole regimen lowered the frequency of dysbacteriosis events and their severity. The fact that the use of acipole simultaneously with the routine antibacterial therapy prevented the development of dysbacteriosis clinical signs is of practical importance.
TI  - Effects of lactic acid bacteria ingestion of basal cytokine mRNA and immunoglobulin levels in the mouse.
AB  - An increasing number of functional foods and pharmaceutical preparations containing lactic acid bacteria are being promoted with health claims based on the potential probiotic characteristics and on their capacity for stimulating the host immune system. However, the specific immune effects of oral administration of these microbes remain undefined. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that basal gastrointestinal immune status in mice is affected by orally administered lactic acid bacteria. The specific objective of this research was to evaluate the effects of repeated oral exposure to viable and nonviable lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. casei, and Streptococcus thermophilus) in mice on basal cytokine mRNA expression in mucosal (Peyer's patches), systemic (spleen), and lymphoid tissue and on immunoglobulin levels. The results indicated that oral exposure to 10(9) CFU/day for up to 14 days did not significantly affect basal interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, or interleukin-6 mRNA expression or total serum and intestinal immunoglobulins.
TI  - Permeability and stability properties of membranes formed by lipids extracted from Lactobacillus acidophilus grown at different temperatures.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 640 grown at 25 and 37 degrees C showed a high content of cardiolipin, phosphatidylglycerol, and glycolipids. Cultures grown at 25 degrees C showed a twofold increase in glycolipids in relation to phospholipids, a twofold increase in the C16:0 and a fourfold increase in the C18:2 fatty acids. In contrast, the C19-cyc and the 10-hydroxy acid (C18:0-10 OH) species showed a noticeable decrease. Extracts of total lipids of bacteria grown at 25 and 37 degrees C dispersed in water yielded particles having a high negative surface potential as measured by electrophoretic mobility. Vesicles prepared by extrusion of these dispersions through polycarbonate membranes of 100-nm pore diameter showed high trapping of carboxyfluorescein (CF), which remained unchanged for at least 20 h. The fluorescence anisotropy measured with diphenylhexatriene (DPH) and the generalized polarization of Laurdan were significantly lower in vesicles prepared with lipids containing the highest glycolipid ratio, in comparison to those of bacteria grown at 37 degrees C. No phase transition was detected between 5 and 50 degrees C as measured with both probes. In accordance with these results, no significant release of the trapped CF in this range of temperature was detected. Bile salts and NaCl promoted an increase in the fluorescence, which is interpreted as a change in the permeability properties of the membrane. This effect was lower with KCl, while CaCl2 did not cause any change. The greater permeability change was observed in vesicles with a low glycolipid/phospholipid ratio. NaCl did not affect the packing of the interface as measured with Laurdan, in contrast to CaCl2. The action of Ca+2 may be ascribed to the binding to the negatively charged lipids, such as phosphatidyl glycerol and cardiolipin. It is concluded that the higher glycolipid/phospholipid ratio and the fatty acids C18:2 and C16:0 enhance the lipid membrane stability and decrease the organization in the interfacial and hydrocarbon zones. These results are congruent with the behavior of entire bacteria subject to osmotic and freeze/thaw stresses.
TI  - Dietary calcium phosphate stimulates intestinal lactobacilli and decreases the severity of a salmonella infection in rats.
AB  - We have shown recently that dietary calcium phosphate (CaPi) has a trophic effect on the intestinal microflora and strongly protects against salmonella infection. It was speculated that precipitation by CaPi of intestinal surfactants, such as bile acids and fatty acids, reduced the cytotoxicity of intestinal contents and favored growth of the microflora. Because lactobacilli may have antagonistic activity against pathogens, the main purpose of the present study was to examine whether this CaPi-induced protection coincides with a reinforcement of the endogenous lactobacilli. In vitro, Salmonella enteritidis appeared to be insensitive to bile acids and fatty acids, whereas Lactobacillus acidophilus was killed by physiologically relevant concentrations of these surfactants. Additionally, after adaptation to a purified diet differing only in CaPi concentration (20 and 180 mmol CaHPO4. 2H2O/kg), rats (n = 8) were orally infected with S. enteritidis. Besides reducing the cytotoxicity and the concentration of bile acids and fatty acids of ileal contents and fecal water, CaPi notably changed the composition of ileal bile acids in a less cell-damaging direction. Significantly greater numbers of ileal and fecal lactobacilli were detected in noninfected, CaPi-supplemented rats. As judged by the lower urinary NOx excretion, which is a biomarker of intestinal bacterial translocation, dietary CaPi reduced the invasion of salmonella. Additionally, the colonization resistance was improved considering the reduction of excreted fecal salmonella. In accordance, fewer viable salmonella were detected in ileal contents and on the ileal mucosa in the CaPi group. In conclusion, reducing the intestinal surfactant concentration by dietary CaPi strengthens the endogenous lactobacilli and increases the resistance to salmonella.
TI  - Effect of fermented milk (yogurt) containing Lactobacillus acidophilus L1 on serum cholesterol in hypercholesterolemic humans.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Two controlled clinical studies were performed to examine effects of consumption of one daily serving of fermented milk (FM) (yogurt) on serum lipids. METHODS: In the first study, subjects were randomly allocated to FM containing Lactobacillus acidophilus L1 of human origin or to FM containing L. acidophilus ATCC 43211 of swine origin. In this single-blind study, subjects consumed one 200 ml serving of FM daily for 3 weeks. The second study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Subjects completed a 4-week first treatment, had a 2-week washout, and completed a second 4-week treatment. In the second study subjects consumed FM containing L. acidophilus L1 or placebo FM over 4 weeks. RESULTS: In the first study, FM containing L. acidophilus L1 was accompanied by a 2.4% (p<0.05) reduction of serum cholesterol concentration. In the second study, strain L1 reduced serum cholesterol concentration by 3.2% (p<0.05) in the first treatment period. In the second treatment period there were no significant changes in serum cholesterol concentration. Combined analysis of the two L1 treatment studies demonstrated a 2.9% (p<0.01) reduction in serum cholesterol concentration. CONCLUSION: Since every 1% reduction in serum cholesterol concentration is associated with an estimated 2% to 3% reduction in risk for coronary heart disease, regular intake of FM containing an appropriate strain of L. acidophilus has the potential of reducing risk for coronary heart disease by 6 to 10%.
TI  - Note: evaluation of selective media for the enumeration of Bifidobacterium sp. in milk.
AB  - Pure cultures of three species of bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium longum, Bif. adolescentis and Bif. bifidum), Lactobacillus acidophilus and a mixed culture of Lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus were each enumerated on two differential media and six selective media for the enumeration of bifidobacteria. The appearance of the colonies on the differential media was as expected but when mixed cultures were present, it proved extremely difficult to distinguish one species from another. Of the selective media, AMC, RMS, NPNL and BL-OG performed well in that they gave good recoveries of bifidobacteria and were inhibitory to the growth of Lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Strep. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lact. acidophilus. However, of these four media, AMC was most convenient as it is based on a commercially available medium, whereas the others must be made up from individual constituents. The AMC agar is thus a good choice for the routine enumeration of bifidobacteria from mixed cultures.
TI  - Cell surface-associated lipoteichoic acid acts as an adhesion factor for attachment of Lactobacillus johnsonii La1 to human enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells.
AB  - The influence of pH on the adhesion of two Lactobacillus strains to Caco-2 human  intestinal cells was investigated. One strain, Lactobacillus johnsonii La1, was adherent at any pH between 4 and 7. The other one, L. acidophilus La10, did not attach to this cell line under the same experimental conditions. On the basis of these results, we used the monoclonal antibody technique as a tool to determine differences on the surface of these bacteria and to identify a factor for adhesion. Mice were immunized with live La1, and the hybridomas produced by fusion of spleen cells with ONS1 cells were screened for the production of antibodies specific for L. johnsonii La1. A set of these monoclonal antibodies was directed against a nonproteinaceous component of the L. johnsonii La1 surface. It was identified as lipoteichoic acid (LTA). This molecule was isolated, chemically characterized, and tested in adhesion experiments in the same system. The adhesion of L. johnsonii La1 to Caco-2 cells was inhibited in a concentration-dependent way by purified LTA as well as by L. johnsonii La1 culture supernatant that contained LTA. These results showed that the mechanism of adhesion of L. johnsonii La1 to human Caco-2 cells involves LTA.
TI  - Effects of yogurt ingestion on mucosal and systemic cytokine gene expression in the mouse.
AB  - To assess the potential for ingestion of yogurt to modulate immunity, its effects on basal gene expression of cytokines in systemic and mucosal sites were determined in mice. Yogurts were manufactured from pasteurized nonfat dry milk using five commercial starter cultures with or without Bifidobacterium sp. and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Treatment mice were fed the AIN-93G diet mixed 1:1 with unheated yogurt or heat-treated yogurt (wt/wt) for 2 and 4 weeks, and control mice were fed the AIN-93G diet mixed 1:1 (wt/wt) with nonfat dry milk. The viability of the various bacterial groups in unheated yogurts was maintained above 10(6) CFU/g throughout the feeding period. The yogurt-feeding regimens did not significantly affect weight gain. Relative mRNA levels in spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, or Peyer's patches for the cytokines interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-2, -4, and -6, and the "housekeeping gene" beta2-microglobulin were determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in conjunction with hybridization analysis. Prolonged feeding of some yogurts decreased expression of several cytokine mRNAs, the depression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha mRNA in the spleen being the most prominent effect. Heat-treated yogurts were more effective in altering cytokine mRNA expression than were unheated yogurts containing viable organisms. Generally, yogurts either had no effect or decreased specific cytokine mRNA in the test organs, regardless of whether they contained Bifidobacterium sp. and L. acidophilus. These results suggest that, in contrast with previous studies in vitro, some yogurt formulations may reduce rather than stimulate basal cytokine expression and that these effects are most prominent in the systemic compartment.
TI  - Ex vivo effects of lactobacilli, streptococci, and bifidobacteria ingestion on cytokine and nitric oxide production in a murine model.
AB  - Increasing numbers of functional foods and pharmaceutical preparations are being  promoted with health claims based on the potential probiotic characteristics of lactic acid bacteria and on their capacity for stimulating the host immune system. However, the specific immune effects of oral administration of these microbes still remains undefined. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that production of immunologic mediators by leukocytes in mice is affected by orally administered lactic acid bacteria. The specific objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of exposure to eight different lactic acid bacteria in mice on ex vivo cytokine and nitric oxide production in leukocyte cultures. Mice were gavaged with 1 X 10(9) viable bacteria and peritoneal, Peyer's patch and splenic leukocytes were isolated 8 h later. These were cultured for 2 or 5 days in the presence or absence of mitogens and then interleukin (IL)-6, IL-12, interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and nitric oxide production was measured. The results revealed that Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. casei potentiated IL-6 and IL-12 production by peritoneal cells whereas L. acidophilus upregulated IFN-gamma and nitric oxide. In contrast, L. helveticus, L. gasseri, L. reuteri, and Bifidobacterium attenuated the production of IL-6, IFN-gamma, and nitric oxide by peritoneal cells. TNF-alpha was not detectable in peritoneal cultures. None of the bacteria altered ex vivo production of cytokines or nitric oxide by Peyer's patch or spleen cell cultures. Taken together, the results suggest that prior oral exposure to lactic acid bacteria could differentially potentiate or attenuate subsequent cytokine and nitric oxide production by peritoneal cells.
TI  - [Initial results of the Erfurt Prevention of Prematurity Campaign].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Genital infection particularly bacterial vaginosis (BV) increases the relative risk of prematurity. Detection of disturbances of vaginal milieu at an early stage and the use of suitable countermeasures such as intervention with antimicrobial substances, e.g. clindamycin, can reduce the preterm birth rate, provided the diagnosis is made early enough. STUDY DESIGN: Since October 1996 pregnant women being given prenatal care in 16 of the 29 outpatient offices in Erfurt, have been informed about the Prematurity Prevention Programme and have been offered to take part and to perform self-measurements of their vaginal pH twice a week in order to screen for any disturbances in the vaginal milieu. Special CarePlan-VpH gloves (Selfcare, Oberhaching) were used to identify patients a risk (pH > 4.7). The pregnant women taking part in the programme were instructed to see their physician immediately, if abnormal values were present, in order to get them confirmed and to start lactobacillus acidophilus therapy (Gynoflor, Nourypharma, Oberschleissheim) or, in case of BV, to treat with clindamycin cream (Sobelin, Upjohn, Erlangen) i.vag. Patients being given prenatal care in the 13 outpatient offices not participating and other pregnant women in Erfurt who were not interested in the programme served as control group. RESULTS: Up to now 59 out of 314 women in the intervention group have been identified as risk cases (p > or = 4.7). 52 of them were treated with a lactobacillus preparation, and 19 additionally with clindamycin cream, 3 patients refused to have any therapy. In this ongoing study the prematurity rate was 8.3% in the self-measurement/intervention group vs. 13.0% in the control group (n = 1,842); 0.3% vs. 3.3% of the neonates belonged to the group of very early prematures with a gestational age of < 32 + 0 weeks (p < 0.01). PROM was registered in 22.3% vs. 32.1% (p < 0.001) respectively. CONCLUSION: Self-measurement of vaginal pH at close intervals, as recommended by Saling, leads to the early identification of women at risk for prematurity. Earliest possible intervention by the obstetrician appears to result in reducing the rate of prematures and in particular of very early prematures (< 32 + 0 weeks).
TI  - Isolation and characterization of acid- and bile-tolerant isolates from strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria have been reported to be useful as a health adjunct and are  commonly added to food as the delivery mechanism. The literature contains many conflicting observations for their proposed benefits, and the mechanism of action is undefined. One source of variation is the large number of strains used without proper controls supplemented. Additionally, many of the organisms are not characterized for their acid shock response or the acid-tolerance response, which are known to vary among bacterial species. Our objective was to isolate acid-resistant and bile-resistant variants of Lactobacillus acidophilus and to determine the phenotypic changes. The acid- and bile-tolerant isolates were obtained using natural selection techniques after sequential exposure to hydrochloric acid (pH 3.5 to 7.0) and mixed bile salts. The acid- and bile-tolerant isolates retained their ability to grow at pH 3.5 with 0.3% bile after the selective pressure was removed and reapplied. Isolates varied from their parents for stability in freezing, lactose utilization, protease activity, aminopeptidase activity, plasmid profile, and cell-wall fatty acid profile. These data suggest that the isolated acid- and bile-tolerant isolates possess growth advantages over that of the parents under stress conditions and may be considered as candidates for probiotic strains after further characterization with animal models.
TI  - Lactobacillus species identification, H2O2 production, and antibiotic resistance  and correlation with human clinical status.
AB  - Lactobacilli recovered from the blood, cerebrospinal fluid, respiratory tract, and gut of 20 hospitalized immunocompromised septic patients were analyzed. Biochemical carbohydrate fermentation and total soluble cell protein profiles were used to identify the species. Hydrogen peroxide production was measured. Susceptibility to 19 antibiotics was tested by a diffusion method, and the MICs of benzylpenicillin, amoxicillin, imipenem, erythromycin, vancomycin, gentamicin, and levofloxacin were determined. A small number of species produced H2O2, and antibiotic susceptibilities were species related. Eighteen (90%) of the isolates were L. rhamnosus, one was L. paracasei subsp. paracasei, and one was L. crispatus. L. rhamnosus, L. paracasei subsp. paracasei isolates, and the type strains were neither H2O2 producers nor vancomycin susceptible (MICs, >/=256 microgram/ml). L. crispatus, as well as most of the type strains of lactobacilli which belong to the L. acidophilus group, was an H2O2 producer and vancomycin susceptible (MICs, <4 microgram/ml).
TI  - Gassericin A; an uncommon cyclic bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus gasseri LA39 linked at N- and C-terminal ends.
AB  - Gassericin A, a bacteriocin that was produced by Lactobacillus gasseri LA39, was  treated with lysylendopeptidase and 3-bromo-3-methyl-2-(2-nitrophenyl-mercapto)-3H-indole. The fragments were recovered by SDS-PAGE and sequenced. All amino acids of gassericin A were distributed by sequence analysis and the bacteriocin did not contain any modified amino acids. The amino acid sequence of gassericin A completely coincided with that found through the cloning of the structural gene. Gassericin A was shown to be a cyclic bacteriocin (class II) which is bound at the N- and C-terminal ends. This is the first example of a cyclic bacteriocin from lactobacilli lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Molecular cloning and sequencing of two phospho-beta-galactosidase I and II genes of Lactobacillus gasseri JCM1031 isolated from human intestine.
AB  - Lactobacillus (Lb.) gasseri JCM1031, which is classified into the B1 subgroup of  the Lb. acidophilus group of lactic acid bacteria, characteristically produces two different phospho-beta-galactosidases (P-beta-gal) I and II in the same cytosol as reported in our previous papers [Biosci. Biotech. Biochem., 60, 139-141, 708-710 (1996)]. To clarify the functional and genetic properties of the two enzymes, the structural genes of P-beta-gal I and II were cloned and sequenced. The structural gene of P-beta-gal I had 1,446 bp, encoding a polypeptide of 482 amino acid residues. The structural gene of P-beta-gal II had 1,473 bp, encoding a polypeptide of 491 amino acid residues. The deduced relative molecular masses of 55,188 and 56,243 agreed well with the previous value obtained from the purified P-beta-gal I and II protein, respectively. Multiple alignment of the protein sequence of P-beta-gal I and II with those of P-beta-gals from 5 microorganisms had 30-35% identity on the amino acid level, but those with phospho-beta-glucosidases from 5 microorganisms had the relatively high identity of about 50%. Considering that this strain grows on lactose medium and shows no beta-galactosidase activity, and that purified P-beta-gal I and II can obviously hydrolyze o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside 6-phosphate (substrate), and also the conservation of a cysteine residue in the molecule, the P-beta-gal I and II were each confirmed as a novel P-beta-gal enzyme.
TI  - Monoassociation with Lactobacillus acidophilus UFV-H2b20 stimulates the immune defense mechanisms of germfree mice.
AB  - Probiotics are formulations containing live microorganisms or microbial stimulants that have some beneficial influence on the maintenance of a balanced intestinal microbiota and on the resistance to infections. The search for probiotics to be used in prevention or treatment of enteric infections, as an alternative to antibiotic therapy, has gained significant impulse in the last few years. Several studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of lactic acid bacteria in controlling infection by intestinal pathogens and in boosting the host's nonspecific immune response. Here, we studied the use of Lactobacillus acidophilus UFV-H2b20, a lactic acid bacterium isolated from a human newborn from Vicosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil, as a probiotic. A suspension containing 10(8) cells of Lactobacillus acidophilus UFV-H2b20 was inoculated into groups of at least five conventional and germfree Swiss mice to determine its capacity to stimulate the host mononuclear phagocytic activity. We demonstrate that this strain can survive the stressing conditions of the intestinal tract in vivo. Moreover, the monoassociation of germfree mice with this strain for seven days improved the host's macrophage phagocytic capacity, as demonstrated by the clearance of a Gram-negative bacterium inoculated intravenously. Monoassociated mice showed an undetectable number of circulating E. coli, while 0.1% of the original inoculum was still present in germfree animals. Mice treated with viable or heat-killed Lactobacillus acidophilus UFV-H2b20 presented similarly improved clearance capacity when compared with germfree controls. In addition, monoassociated mice had twice the amount of Kupffer cells, which are responsible for the clearance of circulating bacteria, compared to germfree controls. These results suggest that the L. acidophilus strain used here stimulates a nonspecific immune response and is a strong candidate to be used as a probiotic.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria growth promoters from Spirulina platensis.
AB  - Spirulina has been used for many years as human food because of its high protein  content and nutritional value. Some strains also produce bioactive substances that may inhibit or promote microbial growth. Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus bulgaricus were grown in rich media, MRS and RM, as well as in minimal saline medium with and without addition of extracellular products obtained from a late log phase culture of Spirulina platensis in Zarrouk medium. In both MRS and RM media, the extracellular products significantly promote the growth of the lactic acid bacteria assayed. This stimulatory effect was observed in media with pH adjusted to 5.3, 6.3 and 7.0. No effect was observed in minimal saline medium.
TI  - A randomized trial of Lactobacillus acidophilus BG2FO4 to treat lactose intolerance.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactose intolerance is the most common disorder of intestinal carbohydrate digestion. Lactobacillus acidophilus BG2FO4 is a strain of lactobacilli with properties of marked intestinal adherence and high beta-galactosidase activity. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to determine whether oral feeding of Lactobacillus acidophilus BG2FO4 leads to a lactose-tolerant state. DESIGN: We studied 42 subjects with self-reported lactose intolerance and performed breath-hydrogen tests to determine whether they were lactose maldigesters. Subjects with established lactose maldigestion (n = 24) were invited to be randomly assigned to an omeprazole-treated (hypochlorhydric) group or a non-omeprazole-treated group, but 6 subjects chose not to participate. All randomly assigned subjects (n = 18) ingested Lactobacillus acidophilus BG2FO4 twice per day for 7 d and stool samples were collected. Breath-hydrogen tests were performed and symptom scores were recorded at baseline and after lactobacilli ingestion. RESULTS: Lactose maldigestion was established in 24 of 42 subjects (57%) with self-reported lactose intolerance. In 18 lactose-maldigesting subjects, overall hydrogen production and symptom scores after ingestion of Lactobacillus acidophilus BG2FO4 were not significantly different from baseline values. Live Lactobacillus acidophilus BG2FO4 was recovered in stool samples from 7 subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Lactose intolerance is overreported in subjects with gastrointestinal symptoms after lactose ingestion. Treatment of lactose-maldigesting subjects with and without hypochlorhydria with Lactobacillus acidophilus BG2FO4 for 7 d failed to change breath-hydrogen excretion significantly after lactose ingestion.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with ducks.
AB  - The diversity of lactic acid bacteria occurring in the crop and intestinal content of ducks of different ages (5 to 34 days) was evaluated using the RAPD-PCR technique and comparative sequence analysis of 16S rRNA. Cluster analysis derived from isolates grown on Rogosa agar used for the enrichment of lactic acid bacteria, revealed at least twenty six different groups of organisms representing species, subspecies and strains belonging to Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Pediococcus, Weissella and Lactobacillus. Homofermentative and heterofermentative lactobacilli were identified, belonging to the phylogenetically defined Lb. acidophilus, Lb. salivarius and Lb. reuteri groups.
TI  - Use of modified Lactobacillus selective medium and Bifidobacterium iodoacetate medium for differential enumeration of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium spp. in powdered nutritional products.
AB  - Modified Lactobacillus selective agar (APT agar + sodium acetate and glacial acetic acid; mLBS) was compared to selective modified Lactobacillus selective medium (LBS agar + tomato juice and acetic acid; mLSM) and nonselective de Man Rogosa Sharpe (MRS) agar for the enumeration of Lactobacillus acidophilus in probiotic-containing powdered nutritional products. The mLBS agar was equivalent to MRS agar and superior to the mLSM agar for enumerating L. acidophilus in products stored in sealed cans at 22 degrees C. When samples were analyzed for L. acidophilus concentration after high temperature storage in sealed cans or storage in open cans at high relative humidity, the mLBS and MRS agars were highly correlated (r2 = 0.93). Modified Bifidobacterium iodoacetate medium (12.5 mg iodoacetic acid/liter; mBIM) was compared to MRS agar + bile, cysteine, and dicloxacillin (MRS + BCD) for enumerating Bifidobacterium infantis or Bifidobacterium lactis in the nutritional products. The two media were equivalent for enumerating B. infantis in product stored at 22 degrees C in sealed cans. However, the two media were poorly correlated (r2<0.50) for enumeration of B. infantis and B. lactis in products stored in sealed cans at high temperature or in open cans at high relative humidity. The mLBS medium has potential industry application as a relatively inexpensive, convenient differential enumeration method for L. acidophilus. The mBIM medium cannot be recommended as a sole medium for enumeration of probiotic Bifidobacterium spp. in powdered nutritional products stored under high temperature and/or high relative humidity conditions.
TI  - Increased growth of Bifidobacterium and Eubacterium by germinated barley foodstuff, accompanied by enhanced butyrate production in healthy volunteers.
AB  - Germinated barley foodstuff (GBF) derived from the aleurone and scutellum fractions of germinated barley mainly consists of low-lignified hemicellulose and glutamine-rich protein. GBF improves the proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells and defecation, through the bacterial production of short chain fatty acids (SCFA), especially butyrate. In this study we investigated the mechanism of production of butyrate by microflora in humans and in vitro. Daily administration of 9 g GBF for 14 successive days significantly increased fecal butyrate content. Fecal Bifidobacterium and Eubacterium were also significantly increased by GBF administration in healthy volunteers. Ten anaerobic micro-organisms selected from intestinal microflora were cultured in vitro in the medium containing GBF as a sole carbon source (GBF medium). After a 3-day incubation, 7 strains (Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, Bacteroides ovatus, Clostridium butyricum, and Eubacterium limosum) lowered the medium pH producing SCFA. Eubacterium grown together with Bifidobacterium in GBF medium efficiently produced butyrate. On the other hand, GBF changed the intestinal microflora and increased probiotics such as Bifidobacterium in the intestinal tract. As a result, butyrate was produced by the mutual action of Eubacterium and Bifidobacterium. This butyrate is considered to enhance the proliferation of colonic epithelial cells.
TI  - The effect of vaginal microbes on in vivo and in vitro expression of human papillomavirus 16 E6-E7 genes.
AB  - Since other viruses can influence expression of human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 E6-E7 genes in vitro, this study addressed whether specific vaginal bacteria do so as well. The vaginal microflora of 18 women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or normal histology and HPV 16 infection, was evaluated by quantitative culture. Expression of HPV 16 E6-E7 oncogenes was assessed in exfoliated cervical cells by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. HPV 16 expression was also quantitated in CaSki carcinoma cell line cocultured with Bacteroides fragilis or Lactobacillus acidophilus. Isolation of Lactobacillus sp. (p = 0.05) and expression of the E6*II transcript (p = 0.03) were associated with low-grade CIN or normal histology. However, changes in E6-E7 expression were not associated independently with isolation of a specific microorganism. Similarly, expression of HPV 16 E6-E7 oncogenes in vitro was unaltered in the presence of bacteria. These results suggest that vaginal microorganisms are unlikely to alter the natural history of HPV-associated CIN by influencing HPV oncogene expression.
TI  - Protective effects of a culture supernatant of Lactobacillus acidophilus and antioxidants on ileal ulcer formation in rats treated with a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug.
AB  - Ileal ulcers and thiobarbituric acid (TBA)-reactive substances in the ileal mucosa were induced in rats treated with a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, 5-bromo-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl)thiophene (BFMeT), at a dose of 1,000 mg/kg administered with tap water as drinking water. However, the formation of ileal ulcers and TBA-reactive substances in the ileal mucosa was repressed by giving the animals a culture supernatant of Lactobacillus acidophilus as drinking water. We measured the antioxidative activity of the culture supernatant and found that the supernatant inhibited the formation of t-butyl hydroperoxide-induced TBA-reactive substances in erythrocyte membrane ghosts. Therefore, the effects of various known antioxidative compounds on the ileal ulcer formation induced by BFMeT were investigated. While alpha-tocopherol, t-butyl-1,4-hydroxyanisole and allopurinol did not repress ulcer formation after BFMeT treatment, ascorbic acid, dimethyl sulfoxide, glutathione and beta-carotene significantly inhibited formation. Among these compounds, ascorbic acid was the most effective. Accumulation of TBA-reactive substances in the ileal mucosa after BFMeT treatment also decreased significantly in rats treated with ascorbic acid. In addition, the percentage of gram-negative rods in the ileal contents of rats treated with BFMeT and tap water was dramatically increased, but it was not increased in rats treated with BFMeT and these antioxidants. A positive correlation between the percentage of gram-negative rods and the number of ileal ulcers was also observed. These results suggest that lipid peroxidation mediated by oxygen radicals plays an important role in the induction of ileal ulcers by BFMeT in rats, and that lipopolysaccharide-activated neutrophils probably produce highly reactive hypochlorous acid and hydrogen peroxide, which are inactivated by ascorbic acid and glutathione, respectively.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus species against Vibrio species.
AB  - Forty-one Lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of Vibrio. L. plantarum and L. casei were the most effective, and L. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of Vibrio species. L. gasseri and L. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while L. reuteri and L. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against Vibrio species. L. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against Vibrio species. However, none of the Lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of Salmonella enteritidis, S. typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. Inhibition of the Vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the Lactobacillus species.
TI  - Ecological and physiological studies on large intestinal bacteria in relation to  production of hydrolytic and reductive enzymes involved in formation of genotoxic metabolites.
AB  - Several hydrolytic and reductive bacterial enzymes (beta-glucuronidase, GN; beta-glucosidase, GS; arylsulphatase, AS; azoreductase, AR; nitroreductase, NR) involved in production of mutagenic or genotoxic metabolites were measured in human colonic contents. Cell-associated AS and extracellular GS were approximately twice as high in the distal colon compared with the proximal bowel, while AR changed little throughout the gut. Measurements of these enzymes in faeces from seven healthy donors confirmed that the majority were cell-associated, and demonstrated high levels of inter-individual variability. NR decreased four-fold between the proximal and distal colon while extracellular GN was reduced by 50%. Most probable number (MPN) analysis on faeces obtained from six healthy donors showed that counts of intestinal bacteria producing GS and AR were c. 10(10) and 10(11)/g, respectively, in all samples tested. Numbers of GN- and AS-forming organisms were between two and three orders of magnitude lower. Inter-individual carriage rates of bacterial populations synthesising NR were highly variable. Screening of 20 pure cultures of intestinal bacteria, belonging to six different genera, showed that Bacteroides ovatus, in particular, synthesised large amounts of GS, whereas B. fragilis, B. vulgatus and Bifidobacterium pseudolongum formed the highest cell-associated levels of GN. In general, bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus acidophilus did not produce significant amounts of AR. All five clostridia studied (Clostridium bifermentans, C. septicum, C. perfringens, C. sporogenes and C. butyricum) produced NR and AR, as did the bacteroides (B. fragilis, B. ovatus and B. vulgatus). Escherichia coli and C. perfringens formed large amounts of NR. Levels of AS production were invariably low and few of the organisms screened synthesised this enzyme. In-vitro studies investigating the effect of intestinal transit time on enzyme production, in a three-stage (V1-V3) continuous culture model of the colon operated at system retention times (R) of either 31.1 or 68.4 h, showed that specific activities of GS were up to four-fold higher (V3) at R = 31.1 h. Bacteriological analysis demonstrated that representative populations of colonic micro-organisms were maintained in the fermentation system, and indicated that changes in GS activity were not related to numbers of the predominant anaerobic or facultative anaerobic species within the model, but were explainable on the basis of substrate-induced modulation of bacterial metabolism.
TI  - The growth of Gardnerella vaginalis and Lactobacillus acidophilus in Sorbarod biofilms.
AB  - Sorbarod biofilms were investigated for their suitability in establishing continuous culture biofilms for the study of bacterial vaginosis. Two important organisms in the condition, Gardnerella vaginalis and Lactobacillus acidophilus, were studied. In contrast to growth in broth culture, both organisms were maintained for at least 96 h in a steady state on the biofilms. With G. vaginalis, the haemolytic activity was consistently maintained in the biofilms in contrast to short-term activity in broth culture which matched the bacterial titre. The simple Sorbarod system appears to be suitable for studying the growth conditions of bacteria in continuous culture and has potential for investigating interactions between micro-organisms.
TI  - Mechanism of inhibition of tannic acid and related compounds on the growth of intestinal bacteria.
AB  - Tannic acid, propyl gallate and methyl gallate, but not gallic acid, were found to be inhibitory to the growth of intestinal bacteria Bacteroides fragilis ATCC 25285, Clostridium clostridiiforme ATCC 25537, C. perfringens ATCC 13124, C. paraputrificum ATCC 25780, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 13047, Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and S. typhimurium YG1041 at 100-1000 microg/ml in culture broth. Neither Bifidobacterium infantis ATCC 15697 nor Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 was inhibited by any of the above compounds up to 500 microg/ml. Tannic acid has a much greater relative binding efficiency to iron than propyl gallate, methyl gallate or gallic acid. The inhibitory effect of tannic acid to the growth of intestinal bacteria may be due to the strong iron binding capacity of tannic acid; whereas the effect of propyl gallate and methyl gallate probably occurs by a different mechanism. The growth of E. coli was restored by the addition of iron to the medium after the precipitate caused by tannic acid was removed. Neither B. infantis nor L. acidophilus require iron for growth. This probably contributes to their resistance to tannic acid. Because tannins are abundant in the human diet, tannins may affect the growth of some intestinal bacteria and thus may have an impact on human health.
TI  - Interference in initial adhesion of uropathogenic bacteria and yeasts to silicone rubber by a Lactobacillus acidophilus biosurfactant.
AB  - The ability of the Lactobacillus acidophilus RC14 biosurfactant 'surlactin' to inhibit the initial adhesion of various uropathogenic bacteria and two yeast strains to silicone rubber was investigated in a parallel-plate flow chamber in filter-sterilised pooled human urine. A parallel-plate flow chamber with a silicone rubber bottom plate was filled with a 1.0 mg/ml biosurfactant solution for adsorption overnight (18 h). Subsequently, the adhesion of the bacterial or yeast cells from a urine suspension under low flow (shear rate 15 s(-1)) was followed in situ by automated image analysis. Control tests were with untreated silicone rubber. Initial deposition rates and numbers of adhering cells after 4 h of flow were determined. Surlactin layers caused a marked inhibition of the initial deposition rates and adhesion numbers after 4 h for the majority of the bacteria (11 of 15 strains tested) and this inhibition was particularly effective against Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Although the initial deposition rates of the two Candida albicans strains were reduced by c. 50% in comparison with the controls, the numbers of yeast cells adhering after 4 h were similar.
TI  - Growth enhancement of Bifidobacterium lactis Bo and Lactobacillus acidophilus Ki  by milk hydrolyzates.
AB  - The determination of the best conditions of preparation of a (tentatively) probiotic starter culture that might be suitable for cheese making composed solely of Bifidobacterium lactis Bo and Lactobacillus acidophilus Ki is critical if a consistently reliable acid production is to be achieved, especially because bifidobacteria have stringent requirements for growth. Therefore, we determined whether B. lactis Bo and L. acidophilus Ki required or benefitted from the addition of milk hydrolyzates (brought about by proteinase or neutrase as the nitrogen source). The growth and acid production of B. lactis in milk were affected by the addition of proteinase-mediated hydrolyzate and, to a lesser extent, by neutrase-mediated hydrolyzate; a higher degree of hydrolysis of either hydrolyzate resulted in greater biomass increase and greater acid production. This result suggests that the poor growth of bifidobacteria in milk is due partially to the lack of small peptides and free amino acids. The rates of growth and acidification by B. lactis were enhanced when cocultured with L. acidophilus (1:1 inoculum ratio). Conversely, the growth rates and acid production of L. acidophilus were not positively affected by the addition of either milk hydrolyzate. Although L. acidophilus grew slowly, its proteolytic system was apparently able to generate its own nitrogen source. Nevertheless, coculture with B. lactis (1:1 inoculum ratio) led to enhanced rates of growth and acidification when compared with that of the single strain, suggesting some degree of symbiosis between the strains.
TI  - Ingredient supplementation effects on viability of probiotic bacteria in yogurt.
AB  - The present investigation studied the effects of cysteine, whey powder, whey protein concentrate, acid casein hydrolysates, or tryptone on the viability of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacteria. Changes in pH, titratable acidity, redox potential, and viability of bacteria were monitored during 24 h of fermentation and refrigerated storage (4 degrees C) of yogurt for 35 d. The incubation time that was needed to reach pH 4.5 was considerably affected by the added ingredients. Also, the drop in pH or the increase in acidity and redox potential was dependent on the added ingredients. The addition of cysteine, whey protein concentrate, acid casein hydrolysates, or tryptone improved the viability of bifidobacteria to a variable extent, but whey powder failed to improve their viability. The morphology of S. thermophilus, as shown by electron microscopy, was affected by cysteine at 500 mg/L, possibly as a result of reduced redox potential. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE and amino acid analyses suggested that the nitrogen source in the form of peptides and amino acids improved the viability of bifidobacteria in yogurt made with a commercial ABT (Lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacteria, and Streptococcus thermophilus) starter culture, which showed a dramatic decline in the counts of this organism in previous studies.
TI  - Note: identification of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subspecies bulgaricus and subspecies lactis dairy isolates by amplified rDNA restriction analysis.
AB  - Amplification and restriction analysis of the 16S rRNA gene (PCR-ARDRA) was used  to identify Lactobacillus delbrueckii dairy isolates and to assign them to its three subspecies (delbrueckii, lactis and bulgaricus). PCR-ARDRA allowed confirmation of predictions from the DNA database regarding the restriction mapping of the 16S sequence to be verified in practice. PCR-ARDRA was shown to be a reliable and rapid method for identifying Lact. delbrueckii isolates at the subspecies level and for differentiating this species from Lact. helveticus and Lact. acidophilus.
TI  - Use of small ruminants' milk supplemented with available nitrogen as growth media for Bifidobacterium lactis and Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Growth of, and acid production by Bifidobacterium lactis and Lactobacillus acidophilus using ovine and caprine milk as media were evaluated for their potential use in cheese-making. A protein hydrolysate (MHP, obtained from incubation of bovine milk with protease) or a mixture of free amino acids (FAA, similar to the amino acid fraction of MHP) was added as a nitrogen enrichment source. Bifidobacterium lactis and Lact. acidophilus were inoculated at 50 ml l-1 and incubated at 37 degrees C with growth supplements added at ratios in the range 25-50 ml l-1. The maximum viable counts of Bif. lactis were lower in plain ovine and caprine milk than in nitrogen-enriched milk, and MHP was a better growth promoter than FAA. A similar trend was observed with the acidity values developed, and attempts to correlate growth with acidity were successfully performed. The highest uptake rates of amino acids in ovine milk were observed for lysine, isoleucine, leucine and proline, but only isoleucine was taken up at a similar rate in caprine milk. Final bacterial viable counts of Lact. acidophilus in the plain and enriched forms of ovine milk did not differ greatly from each other, although FAA was statistically a better growth promoter than MHP. Unlike results in ovine milk, cultures of Lact. acidophilus in caprine milk exhibited drops of 1-1.5 log cycles in viable cell counts by 24 h of fermentation, irrespective of the nature of the nitrogen source. Parallel studies indicated that the excess of fatty acid residues in caprine milk could be responsible for the poor growth of Lact. acidophilus.
TI  - Molecular identification and cluster analysis of homofermentative thermophilic lactobacilli isolated from dairy products.
AB  - Twenty-five strains of thermophilic lactobacilli isolated from yoghurt and from semi-hard and hard cheeses (in parallel with nine type or reference strains) were identified and grouped according to their genetic relatedness. Strains were identified by sugar fermentation patterns using the "API 50 CHL" galleries, by species-specific DNA probes in dot-blot hybridization experiments, by amplification and restriction analysis of the 16S rRNA gene (ARDRA) and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using species-specific oligonucleotide primers. Strains were classified as Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and subsp. bulgaricus, L. helveticus, and L. acidophilus. Strains which were atypical by sugar fermentation patterns were also identified. Most of the strains could not be grouped using carbohydrate fermentation profiles. PCR fingerprinting was used to identify DNA profiles for the 25 lactobacilli. Experimentally obtained PCR profiles enabled discrimination of all strains, which were grouped according to the similarities in their combined patterns. In general, the clustering of the strains corresponded well with species delineation obtained by molecular identification. The dendrogram of genetic relatedness enabled the unambiguous identification of most of the strains which were shown to be atypical by the sugar fermentation profile, except for a discrepancy in one L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis strain and one atypical Lactobacillus sp. strain.
TI  - Lactic acid-mediated suppression of Helicobacter pylori by the oral administration of Lactobacillus salivarius as a probiotic in a gnotobiotic murine model.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We examined whether or not the lactobacilli administered to treat Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection can suppress the colonization of H. pylori, and we also sought to elucidate the mechanism of such suppression. METHODS: We used an in vitro culture system and an H. pylori-infected gnotobiotic murine model. RESULTS: Among the lactobacillus species examined in vitro, Lactobacillus salivarius (L. salivarius) but not L. casei or L. acidophilus proved to be capable of producing a high amount of lactic acid and thus completely inhibiting the growth of H. pylori in a mixed culture. The validity of L. salivarius as a probiotic to suppress H. pylori and thus reduce the inflammatory response was again confirmed in vivo by using an H. pylori-infected gnotobiotic murine model. CONCLUSION: Based on our findings, L. salivarius was found to be a potentially effective probiotic against H. pylori.
TI  - Antagonistic activity against Helicobacter infection in vitro and in vivo by the  human Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LB.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to examine the activity of the human Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LB, which secretes an antibacterial substance(s) against Helicobacter pylori in vitro and in vivo. The spent culture supernatant (SCS) of the strain LB (LB-SCS) dramatically decreased the viability of H. pylori in vitro independent of pH and lactic acid levels. Adhesion of H. pylori to the cultured human mucosecreting HT29-MTX cells decreased in parallel with the viability of H. pylori. In conventional mice, oral treatment with the LB-SCS protected against infection with Helicobacter felis. Indeed, at both 8 and 49 days post-LB-SCS treatment (29 and 70 days postinfection), inhibition of stomach colonization by H. felis was observed, and no evidence of gastric histopathological lesions was found. LB-SCS treatment inhibits the H. pylori urease activity in vitro and in H. pylori that remained associated with the cultured human mucosecreting HT29-MTX cells. Moreover, a decrease in urease activity was detected in the stomach of the mice infected with H. felis and treated with LB-SCS.
TI  - [The role of Lactobacillus acidophilus in the prevention and adjuvant therapy of  certain infectious diseases].
AB  - Authors call attention to the role of lactic acid bacteria in the prevention and  adjuvant therapy of certain infective diseases. It has special importance in the prevention and adjuvant therapy of new-born and childhood enteritis, different urogenital inflammations and antibiotic associated diarrhoea. Administration of lactic acid bacteria create eubiosis between the human organism and the world of bacteria, that is, eubacteriosis is developed instead of a pathogen flora, assuring normal physiologic functions for the well-being of the organism.
TI  - [Therapy of Helicobacter pylori infection using Lactobacillus acidophilus].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In vitro experiments with Lactobacillus acidophilus have revealed its inhibitory effect on Helicobacter pylori and its application in treatment of Helicobacter pylori positive gastritis was examined. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 15 patients have undergone gastroscopy with biopsy and by histopathological examination. Helicobacter pylori positive gastritis was detected. During a two-month period these patients took acidophilus milk (3 x 250 ml a day) prepared according to a special protocol and which contained 4 x 10(9)-1 x 10(10) live cells of Lactobacillus acidophilus at the moment of preparation. Lactobacillus acidophilus strain NAS, gained from lyophilized preparation Bio-Nate (Natren Inc. USA) was used as a test organism. Control gastroscopy was performed 2 months later. RESULTS: 14 patients have completed the examination. All of them were satisfied with the taste of acidophilus milk and could stand it well, whereas in 6 out of 14 Helicobacter pylori was eradicated. DISCUSSION: Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy is recommended in all cases of Helicobacter pylori positive gastritis associated with peptic ulcer, as well as in absence of ulcer when subjective difficulties occur. Antibiotic therapy is often unsuccessful and most often associated with risks of significant adverse effects, being the consequence of intestinal microflora disorders. The aim of using Lactobacillus acidophilus in the therapy is to reduce risks of adverse effects. In our study, by using acidophilus milk only, without other therapy, eradication of Helicobacter pylori was achieved in 6 out of 14 patients. All patients could stand the therapy well and were satisfied with the taste of the preparation. The number of examinees was small in regard to making conclusions, but the results are encouraging and show that apart from established in vitro effect. Lactobacillus acidophilus has a potential in vivo effect.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus is a commensal germ found in the buccal cavity, the digestive tract and the vagina. Usually non-pathogenic except in case of dental caries, it can occasionally be the causal agent in severe endocarditis. CASE REPORT: A 70-year-old woman developed endocarditis on an aortic valve bioprosthesis. Lactobacillus acidophilus was isolated from blood cultures of the valve after surgery. COMMENTS: Forty-four cases of Lactobacillus endocarditis have been reported in the literature to date. Mortality is high (26%). The main difficulty in treatment is germ tolerance to penicillin and aminosides found in all cases. Cure requires high dose parenteral antibiotics and surgery in many cases (26%).
TI  - Conservation of the major cold shock protein in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Primers designed from consensus regions of the major cold shock gene of different bacterial species were used in PCR amplification of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB). An appropriately-sized PCR product was obtained from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis LL43-1 and MG1363; Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris LC10-1, LC11-1, and LC12-1; Streptococcus thermophilus ST1-1; Enterococcus faecalis EF1-1; Lactobacillus acidophilus LA1-1; Lactobacillus helveticus LH1-1; Pediococcus pentosaceus PP1-1; and Bifidobacterium animalis BA1-1. The PCR products were cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequences displayed high sequence similarity with the major cold shock proteins of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis and the human Y-box factor. The amino acid residues of the cold shock domain implicated in nucleic acid binding in several unrelated species were also highly conserved in the LAB strains. It is possible, therefore, that this protein in LAB may also act as a transcriptional enhancer to other cold shock genes and/or act as an RNA chaperone unwinding tightly folded RNA molecules.
TI  - 16S-23S and 23S-5S intergenic spacer regions of lactobacilli: nucleotide sequence, secondary structure and comparative analysis.
AB  - Lactobacilli have been used as industrial starters for a long time, but in several cases their identification was, and still is, neither easy nor reliable. The aim of the present work was to examine whether the intergenic spacer regions could be of value in the identification of Lactobacillus species. For that purpose, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify 16S-23S and 23S-5S spacer regions of Lactobacillus (L.) acidophilus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. casei, L. helveticus and L. curvatus. The PCR products were directly sequenced, and two forms of ribosomal RNA (rrn) operons were identified in each species studied: one with tandem tRNA(Ile)/tRNA(Ala) genes and the other one without tRNA genes. Our study revealed that the rrn operons of Lactobacillus species studied comprise the genes of 16S, 23S and 5S rRNA, in that order. Only the tRNA genes and the rRNA processing stems are highly conserved in spacer regions of lactobacilli. The divergence between the lactobacilli spacer region sequences arises from insertions and deletions of short sequences. These sequences could be interesting candidates for the development of species-specific probes. Theoretical RNA/RNA secondary structure models of the interaction between the two spacer region sequences were constructed. In conclusion, the two spacer region sequences may prove to be a useful alternative to 16S and 23S rDNA sequencing for designing species-specific probes and for establishing phylogenetic relationships between closely related species such as L. curvatus and L. casei or L. acidophilus and L. helveticus.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of acidocin CH5 in MRS broth and milk with added NaCl, NaNO3 and lysozyme.
AB  - The ability of acidocin CH5, a bacteriocin from Lactobacillus acidophilus CH5 in  the form of neutralized and heated supernatant, to prevent the growth of the indicator Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis LTI 30 alone or together with other antimicrobials was investigated. The inhibitory activity of acidocin CH5 was higher in MRS broth than in reconstituted skim milk (RSM). In MRS broth and RSM, 1.92 and 32 AU acidocin CH5/ml, respectively, caused 97 and 89% inhibition of the indicator Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis LTI 30. The presence of 5 and 10% milk fat in RSM decreased the inhibitory activity of acidocin CH5 to 20 and 11%, respectively. The inhibitory activity of acidocin CH5 was also reduced in the presence of NaCl, NaNO3 and lysozyme. In RSM the inhibition was weaker with both acidocin CH5 and NaCl added compared with NaCl alone. In MRS broth the inhibition was stronger with both acidocin CH5 and NaCl added compared with NaCl alone. The inhibition of the indicator Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis LTI 30 was stronger with both NaNO3 and acidocin CH5 in MRS broth (but not in RSM) than with only NaNO3 present, but the strongest level was obtained with acidocin CH5 alone. Addition of acidocin CH5 and more than 30 mg/ml lysozyme to MRS broth increased the level of inhibition above the level obtained by acidocin CH5 alone. The indicator Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis LTI 30 was also sensitive to NaCl, NaNO3 and lysozyme in both MRS broth and RSM.
TI  - Functional assignment by Chimera construction of the domain affecting heterotropic activation of deoxyadenosine kinase from Lactobacillus acidophilus R-26.
AB  - The heterodimeric subunits of deoxyadenosine kinase (dAK)-deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK) from Lactobacillus acidophilus R-26 exhibit contrasting conformations manifested in the nearly unidirectional heterotropic activation of dAK when dGK binds deoxyguanosine. This is mediated, in part, by the conserved Ras switch I-like sequence (residues 153-161) [Guo et al. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 6890-6897]. In an attempt to identify domains differentiating the specificities of dAK and dGK, we constructed several chimeras splicing heterodimeric dAK within this region. In Chimera-III, dAK residues 120-170 were replaced by the homologous section of dGK. dAK activity was elevated 40%, but although it retained its original specificity and Km values, it could no longer be activated by deoxyguanosine. Moreover, both the activated dAK and the "dAK" of Chimera-III exhibited (i) an increased Ks for the leading substrate ATP-Mg2+, suggesting the formation of intermediate enzyme species along their respective kinetic pathways, and (ii) broadened and lower pH optima for the dAK activities. These observations further indicate the importance of dAK residues 120-170, including the Ras-like segment, in catalysis and heterotropic activation. The other conformational properties of dAK (e.g. self-inactivity and MgATP being the leading substrate) were unaltered by this substitution, thus localizing the responsible domains even further upstream.
TI  - Acid production from lactulose by dental plaque bacteria.
AB  - Representative strains of oral streptococci, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria were incubated overnight with lactulose or other carbohydrates and the final pH recorded. Most bacteria tested were able to metabolize lactulose with the exception of strains of Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lact. fermentum. Streptococcus mutans produced most acid overnight but the initial rate of acid production from lactulose by uninduced cultures was very low. Plaque pH was monitored in 12 volunteers following rinsing the mouth with lactulose, sucrose or sorbitol or Lactulose BP. These studies in vivo showed both lactulose and Lactulose BP to exhibit low acidogenic potential. Thus, although plaque bacteria are capable of fermenting lactulose, the results suggest that lactulose is likely to pose a small acidogenic challenge to teeth under normal conditions of use.
TI  - Growth of a human intestinal Desulfovibrio desulfuricans in continuous cultures containing defined populations of saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting bacteria.
AB  - Ecological and physiological effects of the sulphate-reducing bacterium (SRB) Desulfovibrio desulfuricans on other intestinal organisms were investigated in anaerobic chemostats (dilution rate approximately 0.2 h-1). Reproducible defined bacterial communities were used in these experiments, comprising 14 different saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting species: Bifidobacterium longum, Bif. adolescentis, Bif. pseudolongum, Bif. infantis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bact. vulgatus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. faecium, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Cl. butyricum, Cl. innocuum, Cl. bifermentans. Lactobacillus and Cl. bifermentans populations never rose above minimum detection limits (log10 2.0 and 4.0, respectively) under the experimental conditions employed in these studies. Inclusion of Des. desulfuricans in bacterial cultures (c. log10 8.4 viable cells ml-1) resulted in marked reductions (i.e. greater than 1 log) in planktonic cell population densities of several species, particularly Bif. longum, Cl. perfringens and Bif. pseudolongum. The two bacteroides species were unaffected by Des. desulfuricans, while numbers of Cl. butyricum increased. Extensive wall growth developed in the SRB culture, consisting mainly of Des. desulfuricans (log10 9.2 viable cells ml-1), Bact. thetaiotaomicron and Bact. vulgatus, with lesser numbers of facultative anaerobes, Cl. perfringens and Bif. longum. Wall growth was associated with a reduction in planktonic cell mass and increased acid production by the cultures. Chemotaxonomic study of chemostat microbiotas, on the basis of cellular fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analyses, showed the existence of characteristic bacteroides (C15) and bifidobacterial (C18) markers, but desulfovibrio markers (i-C15:0, C16:0, i-C17:1) could be identified. The metabolic activities of saccharolytic organisms were altered in the SRB chemostat, including synthesis of a number of hydrolytic enzymes involved in carbohydrate breakdown, such as alpha-galactosidase, alpha-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase, together with several mucinolytic enzymes. High concentrations of sulphide (8.2 mmol 1-1) were detected in the SRB chemostat, suggesting that this metabolite may have been inhibitory to some species. Saccharolytic organisms growing in the SRB fermenter utilized more starch, but less galactose-containing polymers, which correlated with the observed glycosidase activities. Profound differences were also recorded with respect to fermentation product formation in the chemostats, where a major switch to acetate production occurred in the SRB culture, with concomitant reductions in propionate, butyrate and lactate, which is an important electron donor for desulfovibrios.
TI  - Bile salt deconjugation and cholesterol removal from media by Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - Lactobacillus casei N19 and E5 and Lactobacillus acidophilus L1 and ATCC 43121 were compared for their ability to deconjugate bile salts and remove cholesterol from MRS broth during growth at pH 6.0 and during growth without pH control. Samples grown without pH control dropped to pH 4.2 to 4.5 during 20 h of incubation, depending on the culture. The plate counts indicated that populations in all cultures were near their maximum numbers after 16 h of growth. The amount of cholesterol removed from the broth was similar for both strains of L. acidophilus grown with and without pH control. However, the strains of L. casei differed significantly in the amount of cholesterol removed during growth with or without pH control. Both cultures of L. casei that were grown at pH 6.0 removed very little cholesterol from the broth, but cells grown without pH control removed up to 60 micrograms of cholesterol/ml. All cultures of both species deconjugated 60 to 90% of the bile salts. Lactobacillus acidophilus L1 was the only culture to demonstrate differences between the two pH treatments in the amount of bile salts deconjugated; however, there was no difference in the amounts of cholesterol removed. These results indicate that most of the cholesterol removal from broth by L. acidophilus was due to assimilation, perhaps by the incorporation of cholesterol into the cellular membrane. Lactobacillus casei most likely removes cholesterol from broth by means of the destabilization of cholesterol micelles and the coprecipitation of the cholesterol with the deconjugated bile salts at pH less than 6.0.
TI  - Increased antibody production against gut-colonizing Escherichia coli in the presence of the anaerobic bacterium Peptostreptococcus.
AB  - Germ-free rats were colonized with E. coli alone, or with E. coli plus Lactobacillus acidophilus and a strain of the obligate anaerobic gram-positive species, Peptostreptococcus. The presence of Peptostreptococcus reduced translocation of E. coli, but increased the serum antibody response to E. coli antigen. Whereas the immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-E. coli antibodies largely represented cross-reactive antibodies, those of the immunoglobulin M (IgM) isotype represented true anti-E. coli antibodies because they could not be absorbed by L. acidophilus or Peptostreptococcus but could with E. coli. We suggest that peptostreptococci prime the gut immune system to other bacterial antigens and that this could be a mechanism behind the reduced translocation of facultative anaerobes in the presence of obligate anaerobes.
TI  - Desmutagenicity of milk cultured with Lactobacillus acidophilus strains against mutagenic heated tauco.
AB  - Desmutagenicity of milk cultured with Lactobacillus acidophilus strains on the mutagenicity of heated salty and sweet tauco were examined using streptomycin dependent (SD) 510 strain of Salmonella typhimurium TA98 as tester culture. Cultured milk samples widely exhibited desmutagenic effects against mutagenic heated salty and sweet tauco. Mutagenicity of heated salty tauco was inhibited by acidophilus cultured milks stronger than that of heated sweet tauco. Milk cultured with strains SBT2054, SBT0299, SBT0274, SBT10238. SBT1702, SBT10240, SBT10241 and SBT10239 showed high inhibition against the mutagenicity of both heated salty and sweet taucos. Maximum inhibition was reached after 24 hr of incubation which corresponded to stationary growth phase. Desmutagenic activities of the acidophilus cultured milks against mutagenic heated tauco were mainly attributed to the bacterial cells and also to casein of milk.
TI  - Growth-inhibitory effects of Galla Rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The growth-inhibitory activity of Galla Rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. The biologically active components of Galla Rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (MG) and gallic acid (GA) by spectral analysis. The growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. In the test using 10 mg disc-1, MG and GA produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens, Cl. paraputrificum, Eubacterium limosum, Bacteroides fragilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards Bifidobacterium adolescentis or B. longum whereas the growth of B. bifidum, B. breve, B. infantis, B. animalis, B. thermophilum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. plantarum and Streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. However, GA did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. At 5 mg disc-1, MG significantly inhibited the growth of Cl. perfringens and Cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. At 1 mg disc-1, MG greatly inhibited the growth of Cl. perfringens alone. These results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of Galla Rhois.
TI  - Note: lack of influence of adherent Lactobacillus isolates on the attachment of Escherichia coli to the intestinal epithelial cells of chicken in vitro.
AB  - Two Lactobacillus isolates, Lact. acidophilus I 26 and Lact. fermentum I 25, were selected, based on their poor aggregation with Escherichia coli and strong ability to adhere to ileal epithelial cells (IEC), to study in vitro interactions with E. coli O1:K1, O2:K1 and O78:K80 in an IEC radioactive-assay under the conditions of exclusion (lactobacilli and IEC, followed by the addition of E. coli), competition (lactobacilli, IEC and E. coli together) and displacement (E. coli and IEC, followed by the addition of lactobacilli). The results indicated that Lact. acidophilus I 26 and Lact. fermentum I 25 could not significantly reduce the attachment of E. coli O1:K1, O2:K1 and O78:K80 to IEC under the three conditions tested in vitro, except that the attachment of E. coli O1:K1 was slightly reduced by Lact. fermentum I 25 in the test for competition.
TI  - Study of the morphology of the cell walls of some strains of lactic acid bacteria and related species.
AB  - The objective of the present study was to find an explanation for the biological  effect of the bacteria present in a biotherapeutic milk (Lactobacillus casei CRL 431 and Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 730). The ability of bacterial cell walls to induce an immune response when introduced into an organism is well known. In this paper we specifically analyzed the morphology of these cell walls. Besides the two bacterial strains used in the fermented milk, two other lactic acid bacteria, belonging to another genus and unable to induce an immune system response, as well as a strain of Propionibacterium, of which the immune modulating capacity is known, were used in this work. We found a structural particularly in strains with immunostimulating capacity (L. casei CRL 431 and P. acidopropionici CRL 1198): molecules which protrude from the cell surface. In L. casei CRL 431 these molecules were identified as lectins because they are able to agglutinate yeast cells treated with glutaraldehyde and glycine. The structures protruding from P. acidipropionici CRL 1198 cells were teichoic acids. Teichoic acid and lectin-like structures can participate in adhesion to intestinal cells. The immunostimulation observed can be induced by the adhesion phenomenon.
TI  - Evaluation of an avian-specific probiotic and Salmonella typhimurium-Specific antibodies on the colonization of Salmonella typhimurium in broilers.
AB  - Salmonella typhimurium colonizes the intestinal tract of poultry and causes food-borne illness in humans. Reduction of S. typhimurium colonization in the intestinal tract of poultry reduces potential carcass contamination during slaughter. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of an avian-specific probiotic and S. typhimurium-specific antibodies on the colonization of S. typhimurium in broilers and on body weights. Broiler chicks were spray-vaccinated at the hatchery with the commercial product. Avian Pac Plus, which contains Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus faecium, ad S. typhimurium-specific antibodies. At placement, these chicks were administered Avian Pac plus in the water. Six hours postplacement, chicks were orally challenged with 1.8 x 10 (7) CFU of S. typhimurium. Chicks were administered Avian Pac Plus for two additional days postchallenge. Chicks were evaluated for S. typhimurium colonization and shedding every 3 to 4 days for the first 2 weeks and every 7 days for 6 weeks. The mean cecal and colonic concentration of S. typhimurium from the Avian Pac Plus-treated group was significantly lower at day 31 (P = 0.0001), day 38 (P = 0.0005), and day 43 (P = 0.0001) than the nontreated control group. These results indicated that a combination of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus faecium, and S typhimurium-specific antibodies have a beneficial effect in reducing the colonization of S. typhimurium in market-aged broilers.
TI  - Taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The current taxonomy of probiotic lactic acid bacteria is reviewed with special focus on the genera Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Enterococcus. The physiology and taxonomic position of species and strains of these genera were investigated by phenotypic and genomic methods. In total, 176 strains, including the type strains, have been included. Phenotypic methods applied were based on biochemical, enzymatical and physiological characteristics, including growth temperatures, cell wall analysis and analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic proteins. Genomic methods used were pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), randomly amplified polymorphic DNA-PCR (RAPD-PCR) and DNA-DNA hybridization for bifidobacteria. In the genus Lactobacillus the following species of importance as probiotics were investigated: L. acidophilus group, L. casei group and L. reuteri/L. fermentum group. Most strains referred to as L. acidophilus in probiotic products could be identified either as L. gasseri or as L. johnsonii, both members of the L. acidophilus group. A similar situation could be shown in the L. casei group, where most of the strains named L. casei belonged to L. paracasei subspp. A recent proposal to reject the species L. paracasei and to include this species in the restored species L. casei with a neotype strain was supported by protein analysis. Bifidobacterium spp. strains have been reported to be used for production of fermented dairy and recently of probiotic products. According to phenotypic features and confirmed by DNA-DNA hybridization most of the bifidobacteria strains from dairy origin belonged to B. animalis, although they were often declared as B. longum by the manufacturer. From the genus Enterococcus, probiotic Ec. faecium strains were investigated with regard to the vanA-mediated resistance against glycopeptides. These unwanted resistances could be ruled out by analysis of the 39 kDa resistance protein. In conclusion, the taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria can only be understood by using polyphasic taxonomy combining morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics with molecular-based phenotypic and genomic techniques.
TI  - Lactobacilli counts in crop, ileum and caecum of growing broiler chickens fed on  practical diets containing whole or dehulled sweet lupin (Lupinus angustifolius) seed meal.
AB  - 1. Four experiments with growing broiler chickens were carried out to study the effects of the inclusion in their diets of lupin (Lupinus angustifolius) seed meal of E. coli and lactobacilli counts in crop, ileum and caecca at 3 or 4 weeks of age. 2. Diets were formulated to contain the same amounts of metabolisable energy (12.55 MJ/kg) and protein (210 g/kg). Raw whole (heat-untreated) or dehulled sweet (low in alkaloids) lupin seed meal (400 and 320 g/kg respectively) were used to prepare the lupin-based diets, whose protein content was completed with either defatted soyabean meal or casein. 3. Final body weight and food intake of chickens fed on whole lupin seed meal diets were lower than controls, but gain: food ratios were not different. However, birds given the diet with dehulled lupin seed meal had similar body weight, food intake and gain: food values as those of controls. 4. While E. coli counts were not affected, lactobacilli numbers were consistently increased compared to controls in all intestinal sections of chickens fed on the whole or dehulled lupin-based diets, irrespective of the age of the birds or the presence of soyabean meal or casein in the diet. The lactobacilli species isolated were: Lactobacillus fermentum, L. acidophilus, L. salivarius and L. brevis. 5. The results suggest that the use of whole or dehulled sweet lupin seed meal in diets for growing broilers might enhance the growth of lactic acid--fermenting bacteria in the gut.
TI  - Antimutagenicity and the influence of physical factors in binding Lactobacillus gasseri and Bifidobacterium longum cells to amino acid pyrolysates.
AB  - Antimutagenic and binding properties of 28 strains of Lactobacillus gasseri and 2 strains of Bifidobacterium longum on the mutagenicity of amino acid pyrolysates were investigated in vitro using a streptomycin-dependent (SD510) strain of Salmonella typhimurium TA 98. Four strains of L. acidophilus (SBT0274, SBT1703, SBT10239, and SBT10241) and 1 strain of B. longum (SBT 2928) exhibited the highest percentage of antimutagenicity and binding. These 5 strains were further optimized for other physical factors influencing the mechanism of binding, such as cell and mutagen concentration, pH, and incubation time. In all of the selected strains, 2 mg of cells bound with 88 to 95% of 0.2 mg of 3-amino-1,4 dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole in 30 min at pH 7.0. Other amino acid pyrolysates, such as 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole, 2-amino-6-methyldi-pyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole, 2-amino-3-methyl-imidazo[4,5,f]quinoline, and 2-amino-3,4-dimethyl-imidazo[4,5,f]quinoline were also tested for the binding ability of these strains. We observed that the complexity of the mutagens greatly influenced the binding properties. The binding of 3-amino-1,4 dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole to the purified cell walls was very high compared with that of the crude cell wall, peptidoglycan, or the cell extract. Binding was inhibited when the cell walls were subjected to treatment with metaperiodate or trichloroacetic acid but not when they were subjected to treatment with lysozyme, trypsin, or proteinase K, reflecting the role of the carbohydrate component as a binding site.
TI  - Development of probiotic cheese manufactured from goat milk: response surface analysis via technological manipulation.
AB  - Production of caprine milk has been rising steadily, partially because of its good nutritional value; the possibility of improving nutritional benefits by adding probiotic species such as Bifidobacterium lactis and Lactobacillus acidophilus was assessed. The manufacturing process of a traditional semi-hard goat cheese was technologically modified to optimize the process. The amount of starter inoculum, the concentration of salt, the addition of a protein hydrolysate, and the ripening time were varied to improve the microbiological, biochemical, and sensory properties of the cheese. Bifidobacterium lactis was able to grow slightly (up to 3 x 10(8) cfu/g), but growth was dependent on the physicochemical characteristics of the cheese. Lactobacillus acidophilus did not grow substantially in any of the experimental cheeses, and maximum numbers did not exceed 6 x 10(7) cfu/g. Concentrations of lactic acid and acetic acid increased throughout cheese manufacture, indicating that production of these acids was uncoupled from growth. Viability of the probiotic strains during ripening was sufficient to yield numbers that were above the accepted threshold (10(6) cfu/g) for a probiotic effect. Both strains contributed significantly to ripening, especially in the formation of low molecular mass peptides and amino acids, but lipolysis was not greatly affected. Statistical analyses using response surface methodology indicated that the manufacture of goat cheese could be optimized by the addition of 0.30% (vol/wt) milk hydrolysate, 3 x 10(7) of viable B. lactis and 7 x 10(6) of viable L. acidophilus cells/ml of milk, respectively, 3.50% (wt/wt) salt, and ripening for 70 d.
TI  - Effects of a milk product, fermented by Lactobacillus acidophilus and with fructo-oligosaccharides added, on blood lipids in male volunteers.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate in adult male volunteers the effect of a new fermented  milk product, fermented by Lactobacillus acidophilus and with fructo-oligosaccharides added, on blood lipids. DESIGN: Randomized placebo-controlled double-blind two-way cross over trial with two treatment periods of three weeks, separated by a wash-out period of one week. SETTING: the study was performed at the TNO Nutrition and Food Research Institute in Zeist, The Netherlands. SUBECTS: Thirty normal healthy men, aged 33-64y (mean serum total cholesterol level: 5.23 +/- 1.03 (s.d.)), were selected for this study. Normal health was assessed by pre study screening. All subjects were used to an average Dutch food pattern. INTERVENTIONS: During the treatment periods subjects consumed three times daily a 125 ml of either test or reference product as a part of their habitual diet. The test product was a milk, fermented by yogurt starters and Lactobacillus acidophilus, and contained 2.5% fructo-oligosaccharides, 0.5% vegetable oil and 0.5% milk fat. The reference product was a traditional yogurt (milk fermented only by yogurt strains), containing 1% milk fat. Blood samples for serum lipid analysis and blood glucose measurements were taken before the start of the experiment and at the end of both treatment periods. RESULTS: As compared to the reference product, consumption of the test product resulted in significantly lower values for serum total cholesterol (P < 0.001), LDL-cholesterol (P < 0.005), and the LDL/HDL-ratio (P < 0.05) by 4.4, 5.4 and 5.3% respectively. Levels of serum HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and blood glucose remained essentially unchanged. The beneficial effects of the test product on serum cholesterol were largely related to an increase of this parameter during the consumption of the reference product. CONCLUSIONS: As compared to traditional yogurt, daily consumption of three times 125 ml of test product specifically lowered serum LDL-cholesterol levels in normal healthy male adult subjects with borderline elevated levels of serum total cholesterol within three weeks.
TI  - Survival Rate and Enzyme Activities of Lactobacillus acidophilus Following Frozen Storage.
AB  - The ability of two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, CRL 640 and CRL 800, to  survive and retain their biological activities under frozen storage was determined. Freezing and thawing, as well as frozen storage, damaged the cell membrane, rendering the microorganisms sensitive to sodium chloride and bile salts. Both lactic acid production and proteolytic activity were depressed after 21 days at -20 degreesC, whereas beta-galactosidase activity per cell unit was increased. Cell injury was partially overcome after repair in a salt-rich medium. Copyright 1998 Academic Press.
TI  - Culture supernatants of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium adolescentis repress ileal ulcer formation in rats treated with a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug by suppressing unbalanced growth of aerobic bacteria and lipid peroxidation.
AB  - A nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, 5-bromo-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl) thiophene (BFMeT), induced ileal ulcers in rats after oral administration, while no ulcers were observed after subcutaneous injection. The ileal ulcer formation in BFMeT-treated rats was examined to correlate the administration of cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus or Bifidobacterium adolescentis with intestinal bacteria in the ileal contents and lipid peroxidation of the small intestinal mucosa. Ileal ulcers were observed in more than 85% of the rats treated with BFMeT at a dose of 1,000 mg/kg when they were given tap water as drinking water. The incidence of ulcer formation was repressed by giving culture supernatants of L. acidophilus or B. adolescentis as drinking water, but not by giving the cell suspension as drinking water. Gram staining of the ileal contents of normal rats revealed that 97% of the stained bacteria were gram-positive rods and only 1.5% were gram-negative rods. The percentage of gram-negative rods 72 hr after BFMeT administration was 49.8% and increased over 30-fold in BFMeT-treated rats. However, the percentage of gram-negative rods was 9.7 % or 16%, respectively, in rats taking culture supernatants of L acidophilus or B. adolescentis. In addition, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances in the ileal mucosa increased significantly in the rats given tap water for 72 hr after BFMeT treatment, but not in rats given the culture supernatants of L. acidophilus or B. adolescentis. Since BFMeT induced an unbalanced intestinal microflora, the effect of antibiotic treatment on ulcer formation in rats was examined. The magnitude of the ulcer formation in the antibiotic-treated rats was, in decreasing order, metronidazole >none > kanamycin > a mixture (bacitracin, neomycin and streptomycin). These results suggest that the intestinal microflora plays an important role in ulcer formation and that a metabolite(s) of L. acidophilus and B. adolescentis inhibits ileal ulcer formation by repressing changes in the intestinal microflora and lipid peroxidation in BFMeT-treated rats.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of two bacteriocins of Lactobacillus acidophilus LF221.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus LF221 produced bacteriocin-like activity against different bacteria including some pathogenic and food-spoilage species. Besides some lactic acid bacteria, the following species were inhibited: Bacillus cereus, Clostridium sp., Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus D. L. acidophilus LF221 produced at least two bacteriocins, acidocin LF221 A and acidocin LF221 B, which were purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction and reverse-phase FPLC. The antibacterial substances were heat-stable, sensitive to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, pepsin, pronase, proteinase K) and migrated as 3500- to 5000-Da proteins on sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The sequences of 46 amino-terminal amino acid residues of peptide A and 35 of peptide B were determined. Among the residues identified, no modified amino acids were found. No significant homology was found between the amino acid sequences of acidocin LF221 A and other bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria and 26% homology was found between acidocin LF221 B and brevicin 27. L. acidophilus LF221 may be of interest as a probiotic strain because of its human origin and inhibition of pathogenic bacteria, especially clostridium difficile.
TI  - Sequence analysis by cloning of the structural gene of gassericin A, a hydrophobic bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus gasseri LA39.
AB  - Gassericin A, a bacteriocin from Lactobacillus gasseri LA39, was purified to homogeneity from the culturesupernatant mainly by reverse-phase chromatography. The molecular weight of gassericin A was found to be 5,652 by mass analysis, unlike the estimated 3,800 found by SDS-PAGE. However, when the purified preparation was treated with lysylendopeptidase, it migrated as a single band to 5,600 with bacteriocin activity on SDS-PAGE. N- and C-terminal amino acids could not be identified. The internal amino acid could be identified after gassericin A was hydrolyzed with lysylendopeptidase. The DNA of the structural gene of gassericin A was sequenced by cloning of the gene from chromosomal DNA with an oligonucleotide probe. The structural gene of gassericin A was found on the chromosomal DNA as an open reading frame encoding a protein composed of 91 amino acids. The amino acid sequence of mature gassericin A was predicted to be 58 residues from the DNA sequence and results of mass analysis. These results suggested that gassericin A has a closed circular structure with N- and C-terminals linked. Gassericin A is a hydrophobic class II bacteriocin; it was 98% identical with acidocin B produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus M46.
TI  - Differentiation of Lactobacillus Species by Molecular Typing.
AB  - A total of 64 type, reference, clinical, health food, and stock isolates of microaerophilic Lactobacillus species were examined by restriction fragment length polymorphisms. Of particular interest were members of six of the eight species most commonly recovered from the vaginas of healthy premenopausal women, namely, Lactobacillus jensenii, L. casei, L. rhamnosus, L. acidophilus, L. plantarum, and L. fermentum. Six main groupings were identified on the basis of ribotyping. This technique was able to classify fresh isolates to the species level. In the case of the ribotype A grouping for L. rhamnosus, differences between strains were evident by chromosome typing (chromotyping). Many isolates did not possess plasmids. Six L. rhamnosus strains isolated from four different health food products appeared to be identical to L. rhamnosus ATCC 21052. The molecular typing system is useful for identifying and differentiating Lactobacillus isolates. Studies of strains of potential importance to the urogenital flora should include molecular characterization as a means of comparing genetic traits with those of strains whose characteristics associated with colonization and antagonism against pathogens have been defined.
TI  - On the iron requirement of lactobacilli grown in chemically defined medium.
AB  - The iron requirement of four strains of lactobacilli (L. acidophilus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. plantarum, and L. pentosus) was studied in a synthetic medium under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. Effects of iron salt and iron-chelated compounds were tested on bacterial growth in manganese-free or -supplemented media. No significant growth stimulation was observed in any condition. These results support the absolute manganese requirement for optimum growth of lactobacilli and the needless incorporation of iron in growth media.
TI  - Characterization of natural isolate Lactobacillus acidophilus BGRA43 useful for acidophilus milk production.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus BGRA43 was selected from a set of human origin isolates of Lact. acidophilus strains for the highest growth rates and antagonistic effect against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The strain BGRA43 also exhibited an inhibitory effect on the growth of Clostridium sporogenes. Inhibition of this strain seems to be due to lactic acid production rather than hydrogen peroxide or bacteriocin. Growth of Lact. acidophilus BGRA43 in non-fat skim milk for 6 h at 37 degrees C resulted in a lowering of the pH value to 4.53. Besides the fast acidification, this strain generated a high viscosity of skim milk. These characteristics make the strain BGRA43 attractive for acidophilus milk production. Lactobacillus acidophilus BGRA43 produces an extracellular proteinase. Whole cells efficiently degraded casein for 3 h at 37 degrees C especially alpha- and beta-casein fractions. Total DNA isolated from the strain BGRA43 did not show any hybridization with lactococcal proteinase probes indicating that this strain produces a distinctive proteinase.
TI  - Adhesion of some probiotic and dairy Lactobacillus strains to Caco-2 cell cultures.
AB  - The adhesion of 12 different Lactobacillus strains was studied using Caco-2 cell  line as an in vitro model for intestinal epithelium. Some of the strains tested have been used as probiotics, and most of them are used in the dairy and food industry. Human and bovine enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli strains were used as positive and negative control, respectively. Bacterial adhesion to Caco-2 cell cultures was quantitated using radiolabelled bacteria. The adherence of bacteria was also observed microscopically after Gram staining. Viability of bacteria prior to adhesion was verified using flow cytometry. Among the tested strains, L. casei (Fyos) was the most adhesive strain and L. casei var. rhamnosus (Lactophilus) was the least adhesive strain, approximately 14 and 3% of the added bacteria adhered to Caco-2 cell cultures, respectively. The corresponding values for positive and negative control E. coli strains were 14 and 4%, respectively. The Lactobacillus strains tested could not be divided into distinctly adhesive or non-adhesive strains, since there was a continuation of adhesion rates. The four most adhesive strains were L. casei (Fyos), L. acidophilus 1 (LC1), L. rhamnosus LC-705 and Lactobacillus GG (ATCC 53103). No significant differences in the percentage adhesion were observed between these strains. Adhesion of all the strains was dependent on the number of bacteria used, since an approximately constant number of Caco-2 cells was used, indicating that the Caco-2 cell binding sites were not saturated. Viability of bacteria was high since approximately 90% of the bacteria were viable with the exception of L. acidophilus 1 which was 74% viable. Microscopic evaluations agreed with the radiolabelled binding as evidenced by observing more bacteria in Gram-stained preparations of good adhering strains compared to poorly adhering strains.
TI  - Effect of intestinal Lactobacillus starter cultures on the behaviour of Staphylococcus aureus in fermented sausage.
AB  - The effects of Lactobacillus strains isolated from intestinal tracts for starter  cultures of fermented sausage on the growth rate and enterotoxin production of Staphylococcus aureus were studied at two fermentation temperatures of 20 degrees C and 35 degrees C. Initial inoculated populations in the sausage batter were approx. 10(4) cfu/g for S. aureus and 10(7) cfu/g for the Lactobacillus strain as a starter culture. Samples of sausage were taken during fermentation and analyzed for pH and microbial populations. In control lots without inoculation of Lactobacillus strains, staphylococcal enterotoxin was detected during fermentation at each temperature. Of three intestinal Lactobacillus strains, L. rhamnosus FERM P-15120 and L. paracasei subsp. paracasei FERM P-15121 inhibited the growth and enterotoxin production of S. aureus in sausages during fermentation at both temperatures, although L. acidophilus FERM P-15119 could not satisfactorily suppress them. The effect of the two selected strains in meat fermentation (i.e., fermentation time, acid production, inhibition of S. aureus) was the same as that of a commercial L. sake starter culture for fermented sausage. These results suggest the intestinal Lactobacillus strains selected in this study could be utilized as a starter culture to produce new fermented meat products that are microbiologically safe.
TI  - Use of a continuous-culture biofilm system to study the antimicrobial susceptibilities of Gardnerella vaginalis and Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Gardnerella vaginalis and Lactobacillus acidophilus have been shown to grow to high titers in a simple biofilm system. This system was used in the present investigation to compare the biofilm-eradicating concentrations (BECs) of amoxicillin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and metronidazole to standard tube MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) results. With the lactobacillus, the BEC/tube MBC ratio was at least 16:1, while for G. vaginalis the ratio varied from 2:1 to 512:1. The simple continuous-culture system used in the present investigation is ideal for investigating the BEC for bacteria involved in complex ecological situations such as bacterial vaginosis and may be useful for the identification of the most effective and selective antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Increase in milk yield of commercial dairy herds fed a microbial and enzyme supplement.
AB  - A microbial and enzyme supplement fed at 21.2 g/d per cow to 46 Virginia dairy herds increased the milk yield of 31 herds (17 significantly) and decreased the milk yield of 15 herds (7 significantly). Effects of season were important but consistent with overall results. Herds began receiving the supplement, which contained dried fermentation products of Aspergillus oryzae, Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and yeast culture, midway between the first and second monthly Dairy Herd Improvement tests and continued on the supplement through the 3rd mo. Entry of herds was staggered over 8 mo to reduce the influence of season. The trial involved 3417 cows with 5 test mo between 60 and 365 d in milk. Milk yield during mo 3 averaged 0.64 kg/d per cow more (+0.73 kg/d for first lactation cows and +0.56 kg/d for later lactation cows) than the mean milk yield during mo 1 and 5. Herds completing the study before summer responded similarly to all other herds, which included herds that were fed the product during summer and those that finished the study during summer. Fat and protein yields and protein percentage differed little with or without the supplement. Fat percentage decreased (0.10%). Twenty-one herds that were fed a yeast product prior to and during the study responded similarly to the 17 herds that were not fed a yeast product.
TI  - Peritonitis associated with vancomycin-resistant Lactobacillus rhamnosus in a continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patient: organism identification, antibiotic therapy, and case report.
AB  - A case of Lactobacillus rhamnosus-associated peritonitis in a patient undergoing  continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis is reported. The patient was treated with vancomycin after isolation of glycopeptide-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci. After a skin rash developed, vancomycin was discontinued and replaced with teicoplanin. Seven weeks after the glycopeptide therapy was discontinued, a Lactobacillus strain was isolated in pure cultures. The isolate was identified first incorrectly as L. acidophilus but later correctly as L. rhamnosus. Antibiotic susceptibility testing showed that the isolate was resistant to glycopeptides but susceptible to several other antibiotics. The antibiotic treatment was then switched to imipenem and was successful.
TI  - A case of Lactobacillus acidophilus endocarditis successfully treated with cefazolin and gentamicin.
AB  - Infective endocarditis secondary to Lactobacillus acidophilus is rare and difficult to treat. Management of patients allergic to penicillin is further complicated by resistance of Lactobacillus organisms to commonly substituted antibiotics. We report a case of a 46-year old woman successfully treated with a prolonged course of cefazolin and gentamicin.
TI  - Supplementation of Bifidobacterium longum to a high-fat, low-calcium diet lowers  cytolytic activity of fecal water in rats injected with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride.
AB  - The effects of supplementing Bifidobacterium longum SBT 2928 and Lactobacillus acidophilus SBT 2062 to a high-fat, low-calcium diet on bile acid concentration, fatty acid concentration, cytolytic activity and intestinal alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity of fecal water in rats injected with and without 1,2-dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride (DMH) were examined. Male Wistar rats at 8 weeks of age were fed a diet containing 18% coconut oil, 2% corn oil and 0.1% calcium for 15 d. Lyophilized cultures were supplemented to test diets at a concentration of 1%. The feeding of a high-fat, low-calcium diet elevated the bile acid concentration, cytolytic activity and ALP activity of fecal water as compared to the AIN-76A diet, whereas the fatty acid concentration was not changed. None of the cultures had any effect on these parameters. Furthermore, 8 week-old rats were given a single subcutaneous injection of DMH at 40 mg/kg body weight, and fed the same diets for 15 d. The DMH injection had no effect on the bile acid concentration but increased the fatty acid concentration and cytolytic activity of fecal water. In contrast, ALP activity was lower in the DMH-treated rats than in the non-treated rats. The ingestion of B. longum lowered cytolytic activity but had no effect on the bile acids, fatty acids and ALP activity of fecal water. L. acidophilus had no effect on these parameters.
TI  - Adherence of human vaginal lactobacilli to vaginal epithelial cells and interaction with uropathogens.
AB  - Three strains of Lactobacillus, identified as Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus gasseri, and Lactobacillus jensenii, were selected from among 70 isolates from the vaginas of healthy premenopausal women for properties relevant to mucosal colonization or antagonism. All three self-aggregated and adhered to epithelial vaginal cells, displacing well-known vaginal pathogens, such as G. vaginalis, and inhibiting the growth in vitro of Escherichia coli and Streptococcus agalactiae. The surface components involved in self-aggregation appeared to be proteins for L. gasseri and lipoproteins for L. acidophilus and L. jensenii, as judged by susceptibility to treatment with appropriate degrading enzymes. The factors responsible for adherence to epithelial vaginal cells seemed to be glycoproteins (L. acidophilus and L. gasseri) and carbohydrate (L. jensenii). The receptors of the vaginal cells were glycolipids, which presumably were the targets of the competition observed between the lactobacilli and the pathogenic microbes.
TI  - Vancomycin susceptibility as an aid to the identification of lactobacilli.
AB  - Forty strains of lactobacilli isolated from probiotic supplements or functional foods, and two clinical isolates, have been identified by API 50 CHL and tested for susceptibility to vancomycin. All the Lactobacillus acidophilus (16) and Lact. delbreuckii (two) strains were sensitive to vancomycin, while all the other strains (mainly Lact. rhamnosus, 15) were resistant. Susceptibility to other antibiotics was not species-specific. Differential susceptibility to vancomycin may be helpful in speciation of lactobacilli.
TI  - Antimutagenic properties of probiotic bacteria and of organic acids.
AB  - Antimutagenic activities of live and killed cells of 6 strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus and 9 strains of bifidobacteria and of organic acids usually produced by these probiotic bacteria were determined using 8 potent chemical mutagens and promutagens. The mutagens and promutagens used were N-methyl, N'-nitro, N-nitrosoguanidine; 2-nitroflourene; 4-nitro-O-phenylenediamine; 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide; Aflatoxin-B; 2-amino-3-methyl-3H-imidazoquinoline; 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenyl-imidazo (4,5-b) pyridine, and 2-amino-3-methyl-9H-pyrido (3,3-6) indole. The mutagenicity of these mutagens and antimutagenic activity of probiotic bacteria against the mutagens were determined according to the Ames TA-100 assay using a mutant of Salmonella typhimurium. Efficiency of bacterial cells in binding or inhibiting these mutagens was also investigated. Live cells of probiotic bacteria showed higher antimutagenic activity and their efficiency in inhibiting the mutagens was better than killed bacterial cells. Live bacterial cells bound or inhibited the mutagens permanently, whereas killed bacteria released mutagens upon extraction with dimethyl sulfoxide. Among the organic acids, butyric acid showed highest inhibition of mutagens followed by acetic acid. Lactic and pyruvic acids did not show appreciable levels of inhibition.
TI  - Management of lactose maldigestion by consuming milk containing lactobacilli.
AB  - The influence of nonfermented milk containing L. acidophilus or L. bulgaricus on  lactose utilization by lactose maldigesters was investigated. Nonfermented milks containing L. acidophilus or L. bulgaricus at 10(8) and 10(9) CFU/ml were prepared using 2% low-fat milk. Lactose maldigestion was monitored by measuring breath hydrogen at hourly intervals for 8 hr following consumption of 400 ml of each diet. Nonfermented milk containing L. acidophilus B at 10(8) CFU/ml were not effective in reducing breath hydrogen and symptoms. Nonfermented milk containing L. acidophilus B at 10(9) CFU/ml only slightly decreased breath hydrogen production; however, the symptoms were significantly improved. Nonfermented milks containing L. bulgaricus 449 at 10(8) and 10(9) CFU/ml were effective in reducing breath hydrogen and symptoms. The results for bulgaricus milk were all significant. In this study, L. acidophilus B and L. bulgaricus 449 were chosen because of their similar beta-galactosidase activity and bile sensitivity. L. acidophilus and L. bulgaricus are both thermophilic lactobacilli and an active transport (permease) system is found in both species for lactose transport. The major factor affecting in vivo lactose digestion in this study appears to be the bacterial cell wall/membrane structures. That the cell wall/membrane structures of L. acidophilus are different from those of L. bulgaricus can be indirectly proven by the results of sonication time for maximum beta-galactosidase activity measurement. The results of this study indicate that L. bulgaricus is usually a better choice than L. acidophilus for manufacturing nonfermented milks for lactose maldigesters.
TI  - Probiotic fermented food mixtures: possible applications in clinical anti-diarrhoea usage.
AB  - A probiotic fermented PCMT food mixture was developed by fermentation of an autoclaved and cooled slurry of pearl millet flour, chickpea flour, skim milk powder and fresh tomato pulp (PCMT 2:1:1:1, w/w) with Lactobacillus acidophilus (10(5) cells/ml), a probiotic organism at 37 degrees C for 24 h. Such a fermented mixture inhibited the growth of pathogenic organisms, namely Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella typhosa and E. coli. A significant decline in pH with a corresponding increase in titratable acidity due to probiotic fermentation occurred in the developed food mixture. Feeding of the freshly developed fermented mixture to mice suffering from E. coli induced diarrhoea, could help to arrest diarrhoea, reduce moisture, protein and ash contents in their faeces. The counts of lactobacilli increased whereas those of E. coli decreased remarkably in the faeces of mice from the 3rd day of the feeding trial till the end of experimental period. The beneficial effect of probiotic feeding may be due to antimicrobial substances produced by L. acidophilus, which might have neutralized the enterotoxins from E. coli. The cost of one 200 ml glass full of this probiotic drink is no more than one rupee.
TI  - Functional foods: mechanisms of action on immunocompetent cells.
AB  
TI  - Evaluation of an avian-specific probiotic to reduce the colonization and shedding of Campylobacter jejuni in broilers.
AB  - Campylobacter jejuni has often been responsible for human gastroenteritis. Poultry have often been implicated as a source for these human infections. Intestinal colonization of C. jejuni in the chicken plays a role in carcass contamination during slaughter. Thus, reducing C. jejuni colonization in chickens can potentially reduce the incidence of C. jejuni infections in humans. The use of probiotics to competitively exclude the colonization of intestinal pathogens has been proposed for poultry. Hence, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of an avian-specific probiotic containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Streptococcus faecium for reducing the shedding and colonization of C. jejuni in the chicken intestinal tract. Day-old chicks were randomly allocated into either a probiotic-treated group or a control group. The treated group was given probiotic from day 1 to day 3, and the control group was not given any probiotic. Six hours after the first oral administration of probiotics (treatment) or double distilled water (control), these chicks were challenged with C. jejuni. The frequency of the C. jejuni shedding was monitored until market age. Intestinal colonization was determined for the two experimental groups at slaughter. Results indicated that chickens given probiotics from day 1 to day 3 had a 70% reduction in the frequency of C. jejuni shedding in colonized chicks (P = 0.0001) and a 27% reduction in jejunal colonization in colonized chicks (P = 0.0001) at slaughter when compared with the control group. Thus, the use of the avian-specific probiotic containing L. acidophilus and S. faecium can reduce the colonization and frequency of fecal shedding of C. jejuni in market-aged broilers.
TI  - Ecological study of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus and Lactobacillus spp. at sub-sites from approximal dental plaque from children.
AB  - Previous immunofluorescence (IF) studies have indicated that Streptococcus mutans may preferentially colonise specific sub-sites within approximal plaque. The present study aimed to extend these observations to other mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in such gingival margin plaque. Two hundred and seventy approximal plaque samples were taken from 90 teeth (3 from each tooth) in 64 children; three gingival margin sub-sites in relation to the contact area: away from (A), to the side of(S) and below (B) the contact area. Samples were processed by indirect IF using high-titred polyclonal anti-S. mutans 'c', anti-S. sobrinus 'd', anti-L. casei and anti-L. acidophilus antisera. An overall positive association was found between S. mutans 'c' and S. sobrinus 'd' (p < 0.001). Significant differences (p < 0.1) were found between the proportional counts at each sub-site for S. mutans 'c': A = 39%, S = 51% and B = 70%, and for S. sobrinus 'd' 21, 33 and 49%. Mutans streptococci (MS) appeared to preferentially colonise the sub-site below the contact area (B = 81%), compared with sub-sites A and S (48 and 62%, respectively). S. mutans 'c' and S. sobrinus 'd' were detected together at subsites A = 12%, S = 22%, and B = 38%, with proportional counts at B sites being higher than those at A (B > A, p < 0.01, and B > S, p < 0.05). Lactobacillus spp. were isolated rarely, and were usually found together with MS. There was a positive relationship between the presence of lactobacilli or MS and caries (white spot lesions only), although these species could frequently be isolated from noncarious sites. The presence of both S. mutans 'c' and S. sobrinus 'd' were strongly correlated with early caries lesions. In addition, this study confirmed the variation in the microflora at different sub-sites within approximal dental plaque.
TI  - Effects of various resin composite (co)monomers and extracts on two caries-associated micro-organisms in vitro.
AB  - Previous studies have shown that extracts of various filling materials, e.g., resin composites, may influence the growth of cariogenic micro-organisms. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of important resin composite (co)monomers (Bis-GMA, UDMA, TEGDMA, EGDMA) and extracts of two commercial dental composites with similar composition (composite A, Arabesk; composite S, Superlux) on the growth of the two cariogenic bacterial pathogens Streptococcus sobrinus and Lactobacillus acidophilus. It was found that neither the monomers Bis-GMA and UDMA, nor the comonomer EGDMA, nor the extract of composite A influenced the growth of S. sobrinus in the log phase. The comonomer TEGDMA and the extract of composite S were found to stimulate growth in the log phase, but this stimulation was not statistically significant. However, EGDMA, TEGDMA, and the extract of composite S did stimulate the total growth of S. sobrinus. In the assays with L. acidophilus, Bis-GMA, UDMA, and the extract of composite A inhibited the growth in the log phase, whereas TEGDMA stimulated it. Furthermore, EGDMA, TEGDMA, and the extract of composite S stimulated the biomass production of L. acidophilus. We conclude from our results that a release of EGDMA and TEGDMA from resin composites should be avoided due to their growth-stimulating effects on the caries-associated micro-organisms S. sobrinus and L. acidophilus.
TI  - Incorporation of cholesterol into the cellular membrane of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 43121.
AB  - Cholesterol that was assimilated by Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 43121 was not  metabolically degraded; most of it was recovered with the cells. Cells that were grown in the presence of cholesterol micelles and bile salts were more resistant to lysis by sonication than were those grown in their absence, suggesting a possible alteration of the cell wall or membrane. Cholesterol assimilation occurred during growth at pH 6.0 as well as during growth without pH control. Part of the cholesterol that was assimilated by cells was recovered in the membrane fractions of cells grown under both conditions. There was no difference in the amount taken up from cholesterol micelles that were prepared using dioleoyl L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine or distearoyl L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine. Thus, the type of fatty acid (unsaturated or saturated) in the phospholipid did not influence the assimilation. As the amount of Tween 80 in the growth media increased beyond 0.05%, cholesterol uptake decreased, and the amount of growth remained the same. The higher concentrations of Tween 80 may have adversely affected the permeability of the cells.
TI  - Life on the salvage path: the deoxynucleoside kinase of Lactobacillus acidophilus R-26.
AB  - In Lactobacillus acidophilus R-26, the synthesis of DNA precursor deoxynucleotides occurs exclusively by salvage of deoxynucleosides, beginning with phosphorylation by four deoxynucleoside kinases. Subunits bearing three of these activities are uniquely organized into two heterodimers, deoxyadenosine/deoxycytidine kinase (dAK/dCK) and deoxyadenosine/deoxyguanosine kinase (dAK/dGK), which, along with a distinct deoxythymidine kinase (TK), catalyze the parallel first committed steps of dNTP biosynthesis. Whereas TK is common to most prokaryotes (and eukaryotes), the other three activities that are the emphasis of this review are quite unusual in bacteria. Each activity is regulated in cis by its homologous end-product (dNTP) which is understood to act as a multisubstrate inhibitor capable of binding to both nucleoside and phosphate subsites. Conversely, the inactive dAK subunit is progressively activated by 1) association with a dGK or dCK subunit and 2) the conformationally driven heterotropic affect of dGuo or dCyd bound to the opposing subunit. Limited proteolysis has proven to be a powerful probe of conformational states. Further indication of conformational or structural differences between dAK and dGK (or dCK) is that the former follows an ordered kinetic path, while dGK or dCK exhibits rapid-equilibrium random kinetics. The multi-substrate behavior of end-product binding provides a convenient new diagnostic tool for distinguishing kinetic mechanisms. Tandem dak-dgk genes have been cloned from Lactobacillus DNA and expressed in Escherichia coli as dAK/dGK, utilizing the associated promoter. Sequence alignments reveal 65% identity in their DNA and 61% in their derived amino acid sequences. Encoded N-terminal sequences are identical for the first 18 residues, and both subunits share conserved sequences in common with adenylate kinase and viral TK. A more unusual conserved element, which appears to play a role in the activation of dAK, resembles the G2 loop of p21 ras. Remarkably, no homologous gene(s) for the dAK/dCK pair could be found. Comparisons of amino acid sequences, isoelectric pHs and subunit masses strongly indicated that native dCK and dGK are identical in sequence, except at their extreme N-termini (M-IVL for dCK and -TVIVL for dGK), suggesting that processing of a common precursor occurs in Lactobacillus. Accordingly, deletion of codons 2 and 3 from dgk resulted in the expression of dAK/dCK in the E. coli host; its kinetic properties are indistinguishable from those of native dAK/dCK. Subcloning the dgk or engineered dck gene resulted in expression of active dGK or dCK homodimers, each with a virtually unchanged Km toward its primary deoxynucleoside. However, in common with human dCK, dCK (or dGK) homodimer exhibits secondary activities with much larger Kms towards dAdo and dGuo (or dCyd). dCTP (or dGTP) is the best inhibitor of all three activities of the respective homodimer. Fully active heterodimers can be reconstituted simply by mixing a homodimer with independently expressed (inactive) dAK.
TI  - [Biological preparation based on Lactobacillus acidophilus, a new agent in the early treatment of combined radiation-thermal injuries].
AB  - Male mice F1 (CBA x C57BL6) were used for experiments. Animals were exposed to 7  Gy gamma-radiation and additionally inflicted to full-thickness thermal burn 10% body surface. As it has been revealed, single subcutaneous injection of the created biopreparation based on inactivated lactobacillus microbic biomass increased mice survival with combined injury from 23% to 73%. Therapeutic efficacy of this remedy did not correlate with postradiation damages of the hemopoietic system. Injection of killed L. acidophilus mixture strikingly averted development of the intestine autoinfection. Possible mechanisms of the benefit therapeutic action of the new preparation are discussed.
TI  - Influence of yogurt and acidophilus yogurt on serum cholesterol levels in mice.
AB  - The effects of yogurt and acidophilus yogurt on the weight gain, serum cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and the numbers of fecal lactobacilli and coliforms were investigated in mice assigned to three dietary treatments for 56 d: 1) commercial rodent chow and water (control), 2) commercial rodent chow and yogurt made from milk inoculated with a 3% (vol/vol) liquid culture of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (yogurt), and 3) commercial rodent chow plus yogurt made from milk inoculated with a 0.01% (wt/vol) freeze-dried culture of Streptococcus thermophilus plus Lactobacillus acidophilus. The weight gains of mice receiving yogurt or acidophilus yogurt were higher than those of the mice in the control group. The mean values for serum cholesterol concentrations and LDL cholesterol concentrations were significantly decreased when acidophilus yogurt was fed on d 28 and 56. High density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides were not affected by yogurt or acidophilus yogurt. The highest number of fecal lactobacilli was found in mice receiving acidophilus yogurt, and the number of fecal coliforms of that group was also lower than in the other two groups.
TI  - Lactobacillus endocarditis: a chronic active infection.
AB  - Lactobacilli are gram positive rod-shaped or filamentous bacteria that are a rare cause of endocarditis. We review the literature of less than 50 reported cases, and present a case of a 43-year-old male with a protracted, one-year history consistent with endocarditus. The pathologic findings in the heart at autopsy indicate a long, chronic course of smoldering infection with extensive secondary fibroelastosis of valvular structure and adjacent endocardium, although superimposed more acute vegetation with viable organisms consistent with the premortem blood culture of Lactobacillus acidophilus were abuntly present. Thus, the pathologic and clinical features of this case, and our review of the available literature, suggest that infective endocarditis caused by Lactobacillus species has an indolent nature and results in severe, chronic alterations of valvular structure.
TI  - Effect of intestinal bacteria on formation of azoxymethane-induced aberrant crypt foci in the rat colon.
AB  - The effect of intestinal bacteria on formation of azoxymethane (AOM)-induced aberrant crypt foci (ACF) and DNA adducts in the rat colon was investigated. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens for five weeks and given injections of AOM at 15 mg/kg body weight at the first and second weeks. The number of ACF five weeks after the start of the experiment was decreased in the rats treated with the cultures or culture supernatants of L. acidophilus and C. perfringens. The half-life of O6-methylguanine (O6-meG) in the L. acidophilus group was shorter than that in the GAM broth group. The half-life of 7-methylguanine did not differ among the groups. These results suggest that the metabolite(s) of L. acidophilus and C. perfringens inhibit(s) the ACF formation in rats treated with AOM and that the inhibitory effect of L. acidophilus is due to the enhanced removal of O6-meG from the colon mucosal DNA.
TI  - Biotherapeutic effects of probiotic bacteria on candidiasis in immunodeficient mice.
AB  - Four species of probiotic bacteria were assessed for their capacities to protect  athymic bg/bg-nu/nu and euthymic bg/bg-nu/+ mice from mucosal and systemic candidiasis. Each bacterial species and Candida albicans colonized the gastrointestinal tracts of both strains of mice. The presence of probiotic bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus casei GG, or Bifidobacterium animalis) in the gastrointestinal tracts prolonged the survival of adult and neonatal bg/bg-nu/nu mice compared to that of isogenic mice colonized with C. albicans alone. The incidence of systemic candidiasis in bg/bg-nu/nu mice was significantly reduced by each of the four probiotic bacterial species. The numbers of C. albicans present in the alimentary tracts of euthymic bg/bg-nu/+ mice were significantly reduced by L. casei GG and B. animalis. None of the probiotic bacteria species completely prevented mucosal candidiasis, but B. animalis reduced its incidence and severity. Probiotic bacteria also modulated antibody- and cell-mediated immune responses to C. albicans. The prolonged survival of mice, decreased severity of mucosal and systemic candidiasis, modulation of immune responses, decreased number of C. albicans in the alimentary tract, and reduced numbers of orogastric infections demonstrated not only that probiotic bacteria have biotherapeutic potential for prophylaxis against and therapy of this fungal disease but also that probiotic bacteria protect mice from candidiasis by a variety of immunologic (thymic and extrathymic) and nonimmunologic mechanisms in this model.
TI  - Immune and clinical impact of Lactobacillus acidophilus on asthma.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Animal and human studies have suggested that yogurt containing live active bacteria leads to improved immune and clinical responses. Specific benefits of yogurt containing L. acidophilus on allergic asthma have been hypothesized but not studied. METHODS: In a crossover double-blinded design, the effect of live active yogurt (225 g twice daily) with or without L. acidophilus was studied in 15 adult patients with moderate asthma. Immune and clinical parameters were measured before and after the two 1-month crossover phases. RESULTS: No significant changes were noted in peripheral cell counts, IgE, IL-2, or IL-4 when comparing the two diets to each other. Concanvalin A-stimulated lymphocytes from patients who consumed yogurt containing L. acidophilus produced borderline elevated interferon gamma levels (P = .054). No differences were noted in mean daily peak flows or changes in spirometric values. Quality of life indices were unchanged when comparing the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Yogurt containing L. acidophilus generated trends in the increase in interferon gamma and decreased eosinophilia; however, we were unable to detect changes in clinical parameters in asthma patients in association with these modest immune changes.
TI  - Improvement of lactose digestion by humans following ingestion of unfermented acidophilus milk: influence of bile sensitivity, lactose transport, and acid tolerance of Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - The influence of bile sensitivity, lactose transport, and acid tolerance of Lactobacillus acidophilus on in vivo digestion of lactose was investigated. Four strains of L. acidophilus exhibiting varied degrees of lactose transport, beta-galactosidase activity, and bile sensitivity were used to prepare unfermented acidophilus milks. Lactose malabsorption was evaluated by measuring breath H2 excretion off 11 lactose maldigesting subjects following ingestion of four acidophilus test milks. Test meals were fed in a randomized double-blind protocol. Consumption of acidophilus milk (2% fat) containing strains B, N1, and E significantly reduced mean total H2 production compared with that of the control reduced-fat (2% fat) milk, but milk containing strain ATCC 4356 did not differ from the control. Acidophilus milk containing L. acidophilus N1 was the most effective of the four acidophilus milks in improving lactose digestion and tolerance. Strain N1 exhibited the lowest beta-galactosidase activity and lactose transport but the greatest bile and acid tolerance of the four strains. The results indicated that bile and acid tolerance may be important factors to consider when L. acidophilus strains are selected for improving lactose digestion and tolerance.
TI  - Role of food in the stimulation of cytokine production.
AB  - To study the role of food in the stimulation of cytokine production, the effects  of lactic bacteria on production of interferon alpha, beta, and gamma; interleukin 1 beta; and tumor necrosis factor alpha were evaluated in mice and humans. Yogurt bacteria induced plasma interferon alpha and beta production in mice. Yogurt intake containing 10(11) bacteria led to increased 2'-5' A synthetase activity in human blood mononuclear cells. This result may suggest an interferon action in a peripheral way. This effect was also found when subjects consumed 10(8) yogurt bacteria/d for 15 d. In an in vitro model, blood mononuclear cells cultured in the presence of yogurt bacteria produced interleukin 1 beta, tumor necrosis factor, and interferon alpha and gamma. These results suggest the involvement of a certain type of food in cytokine production under healthy conditions.
TI  - Immune modulation of blood leukocytes in humans by lactic acid bacteria: criteria for strain selection.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria in food can transiently colonize the intestine and exert beneficial effects (probiotic). Survival during intestinal transit or adhesion to epithelium or both seem to be important for modifying the host's immune reactivity. Because Lactobacillus acidophilus strain La1 is adherent to enterocytes in vitro, we hypothesize that contact with immune cells may occur in vivo. However, Bifidobacterium bifidum strain Bb12, which shows high fecal colonization, is another potential immunomodulator. Twenty-eight volunteers were divided into two groups and given a fermented product containing one of the two strains. Lymphocyte subsets and leukocyte phagocytic activity were studied in blood. No modifications were detected in lymphocyte subsets. In contrast, phagocytosis of Escherichia coli ssp. was enhanced in both groups (P < 0.001 for both). Bacterial adhesion to enterocytes, fecal colonization, or both seem to be valuable selection criteria for immunomodulation. Antiinfective mechanisms of defense can be enhanced after ingestion of specific lactic acid bacteria strains.
TI  - In vitro lactose fermentation by human colonic bacteria is modified by Lactobacillus acidophilus supplementation.
AB  - Adaptation of the colonic flora to lactose may contribute to lactose digestion in lactose maldigesters, and supplementation with Lactobacillus acidophilus may modify colonic fermentation of lactose and short-chain fatty acid production. We evaluated the capability of colonic bacteria to ferment lactose and the ability of L. acidophilus to modify lactose fermentation by the colonic microflora in vitro. An anaerobic continuous culture was established and inoculated with fresh samples of human feces. Lactose infusion was maintained at 25 g/d and pH at 6.7. L. acidophilus strain LA-1 (1.5 x 10(10) cells) was introduced into the fermenter on d 0 or added daily on d 0 through 4. The control was the continuous culture without the addition of lactobacilli. Rapid adaptation of colonic bacteria to lactose occurred within 1-2 d, with a significant decrease in lactose concentration and increase in beta-galactosidase activity, and lactose concentrations fell below 3 mmol/L by d 7. Supplementation with strain LA-1 resulted in a significantly greater decrease in lactose concentration and greater increase in acetate and propionate production within the first day compared with the control group. However, there was no significant difference between the fermentation treated with L. acidophilus daily and the control after the first day. These data suggest that the colonic bacteria adapt quickly to lactose, causing efficient utilization of lactose. L. acidophilus supplementation may enhance lactose fermentation during early periods when the adaptation is not established in this model.
TI  - Colonization of congenitally immunodeficient mice with probiotic bacteria.
AB  - We assessed the capacity of four probiotic bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus casei GG, and Bifidobacterium animalis) to colonize, infect, stimulate immune responses in, and affect the growth and survival of congenitally immunodeficient gnotobiotic beige-athymic (bg/bg-nu/nu) and beige-euthymic (bg/bg-nu/+) mice. The bacteria colonized and persisted, in pure culture, in the alimentary tracts of both mouse strains for the entire study period (12 weeks). Although all adult and neonatal beige-euthymic mice survived probiotic colonization, some infant mortality occurred in beige-athymic pups born to mothers colonized with pure cultures of L. reuteri or L. casei GG. The probiotic bacteria manifested different capacities to adhere to epithelial surfaces, disseminate to internal organs, affect the body weight of adult mice and the growth of neonatal mice, and stimulate immune responses. Although the probiotic species were innocuous for adults, these results suggest that caution and further studies to assess the safety of probiotic bacteria for immunodeficient hosts, especially neonates, are required.
TI  - Lactose hydrolysis and beta-galactosidase activity in sonicated fermentation with Lactobacillus strains.
AB  - Milk fermentation with four Lactobacillus strains, including L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus B-5b, L. helveticus LH-17, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis SBT-2080 and L. acidophilus SBT-2068, was carried out under sonicated conditions. Under continuous sonication, viable cell count decreased or grew less than in conventional fermentation, but it increased considerably in static incubation after sonication. Sonication caused beta-galactosidase release from lactic acid bacteria cells to the culture medium, thus resulting in higher total beta-galactosidase activity. However, lactose hydrolysis was enhanced only when beta-alactosidase was effectively released. With L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus B-5b and L. helveticus LH-17. the degrees of lactose hydrolysis achieved were about 75% which is much higher than those in conventional fermentation (below 40%). Results presented here showed that a high viable cell count and a high degree of lactose hydrolysis could be simultaneously achieved by a suitable sonication method.
TI  - Electrophoretic pattern of peptidoglycan hydrolases, a new tool for bacterial species identification: application to 10 Lactobacillus species.
AB  - Lactobacilli have been used as industrial starters for a long time, but in many cases their phenotypic identification is still neither easy nor reliable. Previously we observed that the cell wall peptidoglycan hydrolases of Lactobacillus helveticus were highly conserved enzymes; the aim of the present work was to determine whether peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns obtained by renaturing SDS-PAGE could be of interest in the identification of lactobacilli species. For that purpose, the peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns of 94 strains of lactobacilli belonging to 10 different species were determined; most of the species studied are used either in dairy, meat, bakery or vegetable fermentations: L. helveticus, L. acidophilus, L. delbrueckii, L. brevis, L. fermentum, L. jensenii, L. plantarum, L. sake, L. curvatus and L. reuteri. Within a species, the strains exhibited highly similar patterns: the apparent molecular weights of the lytic bands were identical, with only slight variations of intensity. Moreover, each species, including phylogenetically close species such as L. sake and L. curvatus, or L. acidophilus and L. helveticus, gave a different pattern. Interestingly, the closer the species were phylogenetically, the more related were their patterns. The sensitivity of the method was checked using various quantities of L. acidophilus cells: a peptidoglycan hydrolase extract of 5 x 10(6) cells was sufficient to obtain an informative pattern, as was a single colony. Finally, the method was also successfully applied to distinguish two Carnobacterium species. In conclusion, the electrophoretic pattern of peptidoglycan hydrolases is proposed as a new tool for lactobacilli identification: it is rapid, sensitive and effective even for phylogenetically close species. Furthermore, this work provides the first evidence of the potential overall taxonomic value of bacterial peptidoglycan hydrolases.
TI  - A microbiology investigation on probiotic pharmaceutical products used for human  health.
AB  - Many and different probiotic pharmaceutical products are presently commercialised in the world. On this regard, a microbiological investigation was carried out to screen the microorganisms incorporated into these products, commonly used for human health. After determination of the cell number and viability of bacteria, several experiments were performed in vitro in order to characterise the microorganisms and to evaluate their probiotic value. Among all the strains identified, best results were obtained with Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Enterococcus faecium and Saccharomyces cerevisiae as far as regards growth rates, pH and bile salts tolerance. Moreover, the identification profiles of microorganisms showed a better reliability for the products containing a single species whereas the ones composed of different strains were usually not satisfactory. In some cases, the presence of Lactobacillus and Saccharomyces species was in disagreement with the claimed composition of the product and some species of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and streptococci were found not viable. In defined mixed cultures experiments, the antagonism of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Enterococcus faecium versus Yersinia enterocolitica was demonstrated and explained as acid and/or antimicrobials production.
TI  - The human Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LA1 secretes a nonbacteriocin antibacterial substance(s) active in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - The adhering human Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LA1 inhibits the cell association and cell invasion of enteropathogens in cultured human intestinal Caco-2 cells (M. F. Bernet, D. Brassard, J. R. Neeser, and A. L. Servin, Gut 35:483-489, 1994). Here, we demonstrate that strain LA1 developed its antibacterial activity in conventional or germ-free mouse models orally infected by Salmonella typhimurium. We present evidence that the spent culture supernatant of strain LA1 (LA1-SCS) contained antibacterial components active against S. typhimurium infecting the cultured human intestinal Caco-2 cells. The LA1-SCS antibacterial activity was observed in vitro against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, S. typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter cloacae. By contrast, no activity was observed against species of the normal gut flora, such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. The LA1-SCS antibacterial activity was insensitive to proteases and independent of lactic acid production.
TI  - Influence of carcinogen binding by lactic acid-producing bacteria on tissue distribution and in vivo mutagenicity of dietary carcinogens.
AB  - The aims of this investigation were to determine whether viable cultures of lactic acid-producing organisms (LAB) can bind dietary carcinogens and to assess the consequences of binding for the absorption from the gut, distribution in the body and in vivo genotoxicity of ingested carcinogens. The carcinogens used in this study were ones known to be present in the human diet, namely benzo[a]pyrene (B(a)P, aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and the cooked food carcinogens 2-amino-3-methyl-3H-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 5-phenyl-2-amino-1-methylimidazo [4,5-f]pyridine (PhIP) and 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2). They represent a range of structural types so that the specificity of any binding effects could be addressed. Of the carcinogens tested, B(a)P and Trp-P-2 were bound most effectively by the two LAB strains Bifidobacterium longum and Lactobacillus acidophilus. AFB1 was poorly bound, while MeIQx, MeIQ, PhIP and IQ were bound to an intermediate degree. The extent of the binding of the heterocyclic amine carcinogens was dependent on the pH conditions during incubation and this effect was more apparent with B. longum than with L. acidophilus. Using the host-mediated assay (HMA), an in vivo bacterial mutation assay, it was demonstrated that the administration of bacterial cell suspensions of B. longum and L. acidophilus did not lead to a reduction in induced mutagenicity by MeIQ, MeIQx or Trp-P-2, detectable in the liver of treated mice compared with controls. The lack of a protective effect could not be attributed to a short period of contact between bacterial cells and mutagens, since similar results were obtained after preincubating bacteria and mutagens together at pH 5 for 50-60 min, to maximize the binding, before gavaging the mice. Lack of activity of B(a)P in the HMA prevented the determination of the effect of LAB on genotoxicity of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. However, it is clear from the radiolabel distribution study that the amount of the carcinogen entering the blood was not significantly reduced by B. longum administration. In addition, the amount of radiolabelled B(a)P that reached the target organs (liver, lungs and heart) was also not affected by the LAB administration. A similar lack of inhibitory effect of B. longum on blood concentration and accumulation in the liver of Trp-P-2 was apparent. The results of the present study suggest that although LAB may bind carcinogens in vitro, this does not lead to major changes in absorption and distribution of carcinogens in the body, or in their genotoxic activity in the liver.
TI  - Survival of lactic acid bacteria in a dynamic model of the stomach and small intestine: validation and the effects of bile.
AB  - This study was conducted to validate a dynamic model of the stomach and small intestine to quantify the survival of lactic acid bacteria and to assess the influence of gastrointestinal secretions. The survival of a single strain of each of the following species, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus, was measured under physiological conditions (e.g., peristalsis, changes in pH, and changes in concentrations of enzymes and bile) and were compared with data obtained from humans. No significant differences were found between the in vitro and in vivo data, indicating that the model has a predictive value for the survival of these bacteria in humans. The survival of these strains of lactic acid bacteria in the gastrointestinal model was investigated under two different conditions in the small intestine: simulation of physiological secretion of bile and low bile secretion. Reductions in viability were significantly different between the bacterial species. The dose-response effect of bile on the survival of the tested bacteria was significant, demonstrating the bactericidal effect of bile salts. This study demonstrates the differences among bacterial species in their sensitivity to gastric and intestinal secretions.
TI  - [Antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities of Lactobacillus acidophilus Ke-10].
AB  - In addition to a high antimicrobial activity toward infective agents of some diseases of the human gastrointestinal tract, Lactobacillus acidophilus Ke-10 also had an immunomodulatory effect in physiological experiments both in vivo and in vitro. This strain of lactic acid bacteria was found to be able to restore the proliferation reaction of lymphocytes and their capacity to produce interleukin-2 (IL-2) in rats with a model radiation-induced immune deficiency.
TI  - Isolation and partial amino acid sequence of bacteriocins produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Bacteriocins produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus JCM 1023, JCM 1028, JCM 1021,  JCM 1229, and JCM 5342 were active against closely related lactobacilli. These bacteriocins were purified and partial sequenced. Bacteriocin activities of L. acidophilus JCM 1023 and JCM 1028 were associated with two components. On the basis of N-terminal amino acid sequencing and the molecular masses, it is interpreted that these two-component bacteriocins are identical to acidocin J1132, a bacteriocin from L. acidophilus JCM 1132 [Tahara et al., Appl. Environ. Microbiol., 62, 892-897 (1996)]. Other bacteriocins were single-peptide bacteriocins.
TI  - Role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of short bowel syndrome-associated D-lactic  acidemia.
AB  - Previously, we have demonstrated that short bowel syndrome (SBS) patients suffer  daily from D-lactic acidemia; in these patients rather high amounts of (bacterial) D-lactate emerge in blood and urine with a circadian rhythm. The aim of this study was to establish the microbial basis of D-lactic acidemia in SBS. Therefore, faecal flora of (young and adult) SBS-patients was analysed qualitatively and quantitatively, and compared to that of controls. The isolated bacterial species were screened for massive D- and/or L-lactate production after in vitro growth. After introduction of oral feeding in SBS-infants shortly after the resection, lactobacilli increased from < or = 1% up to 60 +/- 5% of the faecal flora within 2-3 weeks. In the faeces of patients with oral feeding the lactate producers Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus fermentum were the major resident bacteria (each with 10(10)-10(12) cfu/g faeces). During active growth in vitro these lactobacilli produced massive amounts of D- and L-lactic acid from glucose. Use of oral antibiotics in two SBS-children did not reduce the total numbers of lactobacilli, but caused shifts within the intestinal populations of at least lactobacilli. It is concluded that the strongly reduced intestinal capacity for carbohydrate absorption and the oral consumption of easily fermentable carbohydrates form the physiological basis for D-lactic acidemia in SBS, and that the fermentative D-lactate production by intestinal bacteria, especially the abundant, resident lactobacilli, forms its microbial basis. In these patients the antimicrobial and therapeutic effects of antibiotics are unpredictable.
TI  - Inhibition of initial adhesion of uropathogenic Enterococcus faecalis to solid substrata by an adsorbed biosurfactant layer from Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The potency of the Lactobacillus acidophilus RC14 biosurfactant "surlactin" to reduce the initial adhesion of Enterococcus faecalis 1131 was investigated on a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic substratum in a parallel-plate flow chamber, using phosphate-buffered saline and pooled human urine as a suspending fluid. METHODS: A parallel-plate flow chamber with a glass or silicone rubber bottom plate was filled with different biosurfactant solutions of 0, 0.01, 0.1, or 1.0 mg/mL for overnight adsorption (18 hours). Subsequently, the adhesion of E. faecalis on thus prepared biosurfactant layers was observed in situ in phosphate-buffered saline or in urine by automated image analysis. RESULTS: Adsorbed biosurfactant layers caused an important, dose-related inhibition of the initial deposition rate of E. faecalis and the number of adherent bacteria after 4 hours on both hydrophilic glass and hydrophobic silicone rubber, although this effect was stronger in buffer than in urine. For the experiments carried out in urine, the inhibitory effect of the biosurfactant layer was largest when silicone rubber was used rather than glass, whereas no influence of the substratum hydrophobicity on the inhibition of E. faecalis adhesion was noticed for experiments performed in buffer. CONCLUSIONS: The biosurfactant surlactin, as released by several Lactobacillus isolates, might open the way to the development of antiadhesive biologic coatings for catheter materials. It should be considered, however, that these results are preliminary and that the efficiency of the biosurfactant is probably affected not only by the hydrophobicity of the substratum and the suspending fluid, but also by the type of uropathogen involved.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of the adhering human Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LB.
AB  - The spent culture supernatant of the human Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LB produces an antibacterial activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. It decreased the in vitro viability of Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp. In contrast, it did not inhibit lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. The activity was heat stable and relatively sensitive to enzymatic treatments and developed under acidic conditions. The antimicrobial activity was independent of lactic acid production. Activity against S. typhimurium SL1344 infecting human cultured intestinal Caco-2 cells was observed as it was in the conventional C3H/He/oujco mouse model with S. typhimurium C5 infection and oral treatment with the LB spent culture supernatant.
TI  - Fermented products with probiotic qualities.
AB  - For several centuries, fermented products derived from plant or animal materials  have been an acceptable and essential part of the diet in most parts of the world. Health benefits have also often been associated with them. Probiotics can be defined as fermented food containing specific live microorganisms or a live microbial food or feed supplement, which beneficially effects the human or the host animal by improving its intestinal microbial balance. Nearly all probiotics currently on the market contain Lactobacilli, Streptococci, Enterococci or Bifidobacteria. In contrast to Japan, where freeze-dried microorganisms are consumed by a substantial part of the human population, in Europe, probiotic action towards humans are only claimed for certain fermented dairy products (e.g. yoghurts). Those species that have been extensively studied so far, with several experimental trials on man, are the two yoghurt bacteria Streptocaccus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus, L. casei and Bifidobacteria. L. acidophilus has also received important scientific interest, however, only a few human studies have been carried out. From the technological point of view a good probiotic should be stable and viable for long periods under storage, should be able to survive the low pH levels of the stomach, be able to colonise the epithelium of the gastro-intestinal tract of the host, should not be pathogenic and, last but not least, must be capable of exerting a growth promoting effect or a resistance to infectious diseases. The beneficial effects of probiotics are mainly contributed to a direct antagonistic effect against specific groups of microorganisms (Enteropathogenes), by an effect on the metabolism in the gut or by a stimulation of systemic or mucosal immunity. We will present major proven health benefits of milks fermented with those bacterial species and discuss, where possible, the impact of the specific selection and utilisation of particular strains.
TI  - Pharmaceutical probiotics for the treatment of anaerobic and other infections.
AB  - Pharmaceutical probiotics have been used as alternative treatments or preventative therapies for a variety of clinical diseases. The overuse of antibiotics and emergence of multiple-antibiotic resistant pathogens has refocused clinical attention on the field of probiotics. Anaerobic infections which seem to respond well to probiotics are infections which involve the disruption of normal microbial flora. Gastrointestinal infections (travelers' diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea,Clostridium difficile disease, rotavirus diarrhea) have been studied using the following pharmaceutical probiotics:Saccharomyces boulardii, Lactobacillus casei GG, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Streptococcus thermophilus and Enterococcus faecium. Vaginitis has been experimentally studied using L. acidophilus and L. casei GG. The efficacy, safety and mechanisms of action of these various probiotics are reviewed. Requirements for drug approval are similar for biologic probiotics and new drug entities and these requirements involve preclinical tolerability studies, pharmacokinetic studies and large, well-controlled blinded clinical trials.
TI  - Characterization of an intracellular oligopeptidase from Lactobacillus paracasei.
AB  - An intracellular oligopeptidase from Lactobacillus paracasei Lc-01 has been purified to homogeneity by Fast Flow Q Sepharose, hydroxyapatite, and Mono Q chromatography. The molecular mass of the enzyme was determined to be 140 kDa by gel filtration and approximately 30 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and SDS-capillary electrophoresis. The pI of the enzyme was at pH 4.5. The enzyme expressed maximum activity at pH 8.0 and 40 degrees C. Oligopeptidase activity on bradykinin was inhibited strongly by 1,10-phenantroline and EDTA and partly by p-chloromercuribenzoic acid but not by phosphoramidon or phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Marked inhibition by beta-casein fragment 58 to 72 was demonstrated. The enzyme showed neither general aminopeptidase nor caseinolytic activity, and it degraded only oligopeptides between 8 and 13 amino acids. The enzyme readily hydrolyzed the Phe-Ser and Pro-Phe bonds of bradykinin; the Phe-His bond of angiotensin I; the Pro-Gln, Gln-Phe, and Phe-Gly bonds of substance P; and the Pro-Tyr bond of neurotensin. Weak activity toward the Ala-Tyr and Pro-Ser bonds of alpha(s1)-casein fragment 157 to 164, was observed. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the oligopeptidase showed a high degree of homology to the lactacin B inducer from Lactobacillus acidophilus.
TI  - Development of oligonucleotide primers from the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic sequences for identifying different dairy and probiotic lactic acid bacteria by PCR.
AB  - Spacer regions between the 16S and 23S rRNA genes of different dairy and probiotic lactic acid bacteria were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with conserved primers and the nucleotide sequences of these spacer regions were determined. Amplification/oligonucleotide primer pairs were designed for Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus and Streptococcus thermophilus based on the differences in the nucleotide sequences of the 16S-23S rRNA spacer regions. Also a primer pair identifying both Lb. paracasei and Lb. rhamnosus was designed. In addition to conventional PCR in a heat block a rapid PCR method in an Air Thermocycler (ATC) with glass capillaries was used.
TI  - Identification of the replication region of the Lactobacillus acidophilus plasmid pLA106.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of plasmid pLA106 (2862 bp) from Lactobacillus acidophilus TK8912 was determined. Based on this sequence, the location of the genes for mobilization-plasmid recombination protein (mob), replication origin (ori), transcriptional repressor protein (repA) and replication initiation protein (repB) were predicted. Deletion analysis showed that the 1.4-kb PstI-EcoRV fragment carrying the ori, repA and repB genes is able to replicate in Lactobacillus and Escherichia coli cells. The plasmid pLA106 appears to have most features of the pLS1/pE194 plasmid family.
TI  - cis-Active Ras G2-like sequence implicated in the heterotropic activation of the  deoxyadenosine kinase of Lactobacillus acidophilus R-26.
AB  - Deoxyadenosine kinase (dAK) forms a heterodimer with either deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK) or deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), and is heterotropically activated 3-5 times by dGuo or dCyd. Expressed alone, dAK is inactive and exhibits no response to dGuo or dCyd; activity and heterotropic response are fully restored upon reassociation with dGK or dCK. However, turnover of independently expressed dGK or dCK is nearly maximal, being further activated only 50-100% upon reassociation with dAK. In neither case is the heterotropic activation due to ligand-induced heterodimer formation. A proline/alanine substitution within a dAK segment homologous to loop G2 of Ras proteins yielded a heterodimer with dAK permanently cis-activated 2-fold, with a corresponding reduction in heterotropic activation by dGuo. A chimeric dAK, with 25% of its C terminus substituted by the homologous sequence from dGK, was inactive alone, and its characteristics were unchanged in the reconstituted heterodimer. Superimposing the Pro/Ala substitution on this chimera also reduced heterotropic activation by half. Cross-linking the dimer by 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene was inhibited by ATP, dATP, dGTP, and dAdo, suggesting the proximity of the active site(s) to the interface. These data suggest that dAK depends on dGK or dCK in a manner resembling the reliance of Ras upon GTPase activating protein.
TI  - Counteracting Fusarium proliferatum toxicity in broiler chicks by supplementing drinking water with Poultry Aid Plus.
AB  - To test whether Poultry Aid Plus (PAP, a commercial product for drinking water application) could reduce the stress on broiler chicks caused by Fusarium proliferatum contamination of feed, water (with or without PAP application, according to the manufacturer's instructions), and feed (experimentally infected with F. proliferatum fermented and dried corn culture material, CM) were provided to broiler chicks for 3 wk. Eight treatments consisting of a 2 (with or without PAP in water) x 4 (0, 1, 2, and 4% CM in feed) factorial design were tested in four replicate cages of six chicks each. The diet with 2% CM reduced weight gain by 23%; this reduction was preventable by PAP water application. The diet with 4% CM caused a cumulative mortality of 87.5%, which was reduced by PAP water application to 50%. The population half-life of the chicks on the diet with 4% CM was 6.5 d; this half-life was prolonged to at least 21 d by PAP water application. The PAP application also reduced the relative weight of the small intestine and promoted Lactobacillus colonization of the large intestine regardless of the level of CM in feed. Therefore, water application of PAP can be a prophylactic measure for F. proliferatum toxicity in poultry production.
TI  - Isolation and partial characterization of bacteriocins produced by Lactobacillus  gasseri JCM 2124.
AB  - Four antibacterially active peptides (B1 to B4) were purified from the culture broth of L. gasseri JCM 2124. The B2 peptide (gassericin B2) was determined to be 4400 Da by mass spectrometry and partially sequenced. Gassericin B2 did not show any sequence similarities to other known bacteriocins. The B1 and B3 peptides shared identical sequences with two peptides of a two-component bacteriocin from Lactobacillus acidophilus. However, synergistic activity upon complementation of B1 and B3 was not observed. Based on amino acid sequencing and molecular mass, it is suggested that B1 and B4 peptides were derived from B3 (gassericin B3).
TI  - Oral supplementation with lactic acid-producing bacteria during intake of clindamycin.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of administration of clindamycin with or without supplementation of the intestinal microflora with Bifidobacterium bifidum and Lactobacillus acidophilus. METHODS: Twenty-three healthy subjects received clindamycin by mouth for 7 days. Eleven of the subjects also received capsules containing lyophilized L. acidophilus and B. bifidum for 14 days. The other 12 subjects received placebo. RESULTS: There was a marked decrease in total numbers of anaerobic bacteria during the administration of clindamycin. In the lactic acid bacteria-supplemented group, a tendency towards delayed reduction and earlier increase in bifidobacteria was observed, and two of 11 subjects (18%) were colonized with Clostridium difficile, in comparison with five of 12 (41%) in the placebo group. The total number of microorganisms was significantly higher in the lactic acid bacteria-supplemented group than in the placebo group (p=0.02) 4 days after the end of clindamycin administration. The difference was mainly due to higher counts of Escherichia coli and enterococci. Mean levels of other enterobacteria increased less in the lactic acid bacteria-supplemented group than in the placebo group between days 0 and 14. CONCLUSIONS: The recolonization with aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms was faster in the lactic acid bacteria-supplemented group than in the placebo group. This may be of importance in preventing colonization with C. difficile.

AB  - Several bacterial strains were examined for their ability to degrade the nitroaromatic explosive 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT). The strains examined included various clostridial strains isolated from a 4-year-old munition enrichment, related clostridial strains obtained from a culture collection, two enteric bacteria, and three lactobacilli. All Clostridium species tested were able to reduce TNT rapidly in a complex medium. In cell suspension experiments, these strains were also able to reduce 2,4-diamino-6-nitrotoluene (DANT) to 2,4,6-triaminotoluene (TAT) and to produce a compound that is not yet identified; thus, they could not be distinguished from one another with regard to the pathway of transformation. The enteric strains and the lactobacilli were able to perform the initial reduction of TNT, but none was capable of reducing DANT in cell suspensions.
TI  - Analysis of lactobacillus products for phages and bacteriocins that inhibit vaginal lactobacilli.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacterial vaginosis is associated with an unexplained loss of vaginal  lactobacilli. Previously, we have identified certain vaginal lactobacilli-released phages that can inhibit in vitro other vaginal lactobacilli. However, there is no apparent route for phages to be transmitted among women. The purpose of this study was to identify whether certain Lactobacillus products commonly used by women release phages or bacteriocins that can inhibit vaginal lactobacilli. METHODS: From 26 Lactobacillus products (2 acidophilus milks, 20 yogurts, 3 Lactobacillus pills, and 1 vaginal douche mix), lactobacilli were isolated with Rogosa SL agar (Difco, Detroit, MI). From these lactobacilli, phages and bacteriocins were induced with mitomycin C and tested against a collection of vaginal Lactobacillus strains. RESULTS: From the 26 products, 43 Lactobacillus strains were isolated. Strains from 11 yogurts released phages, among which 7 inhibited vaginal lactobacilli. Eleven strains released bacteriocins that inhibited vaginal lactobacilli. While about one-half of the vaginal strains were lysed by bacteriocins, less than 20% were lysed by phages. CONCLUSIONS: Some vaginal lactobacilli were inhibited in vitro by phages or bacteriocins released from Lactobacillus products used by women, implying that vaginal lactobacilli may be reduced naturally due to phages or bacteriocins from the environment.
TI  - Prevention of prematurity. A review of our activities during the last 25 years.
AB  - For 25 years we have been engaged in programs for prevention of prematurity. In the initial stages we tried to use lists which might indicate increased risk of prematurity to select groups with higher disposition in this direction, and to initiate more intensive care with these patients. The earlier results have been positive, but such programs required such high expenditure (of time, energy, and cost) that they could not permanently be maintained. Another supporting contribution for prematurity prevention was the introduction of vaginal disinfectant measures in cases of PROM. Historically, one of the most urgent tasks of obstetrics has been and is the reduction in the unwanted birth rate of very small prematures infants. Long-lasting impairments of these infants still occur too frequently. Ascending genital infections, particularly before 32 gestational weeks, are the most important cause of prematurity. This has been confirmed by the excellent results achieved after creating a complete barrier by an operative total cervical occlusion in cases with recurrent late abortions. It is difficult to realize programs for prematurity prevention based on socio-economic factors, because of the expense with the necessary increase in time and staff. Our new "Prematurity-Prevention-Program" is based mainly on the hypothesis that the ascension of genital infection directly affects prematurity. We found that in women with prematurity symptoms, signs of impairment of the immune system could be found, thus reinforcing the assumption that ascending infections are probably enhanced by such impairments. The best chance of preventing early prematurity is to employ a prophylactic screening program, preferably including self pH-measurement of all pregnant patients and paying additional attention to all other risk factors. The preliminary results of our "Prematurity-Prevention-Program" were encouraging. The rate of very small prematures with birth weight of less than 1.500 g in all participating pregnant patients is now clearly lower at 1.4% than in immediately previous pregnancies when the rate was 7.8%. The rate of extremely small infants of less than 1.000 g amounts now to 1.0%, compared to 4.0% previously. From another retrospective evaluation, we found that the earlier in the pregnancy the prematures are born, the more often their mothers have had pathologically elevated vaginal pH-levels upon admission. In premature births at less than 32 weeks of gestation, all fifteen of the mothers had increased pH-levels. For premature births of later gestation, the frequency was only 61%. Further, we noted that in 67% of all the nearly 700 pregnant patients evaluated, consistently normal pH-levels were present, while in 33% they were increased. In cases with increased vaginal pH-levels, lactobacillus acidophilus treatment was successful in more than 80% of the 75 patients after therapy of 5 +/- 3 days. By our program, we feel that a decisive step has been taken in achieving practical and efficient means of preventing premature births.
TI  - Nonlipopolysaccharide component(s) of Lactobacillus acidophilus stimulate(s) the  production of interleukin-1 alpha and tumor necrosis factor-alpha by murine macrophages.
AB  - Previous studies in our laboratory suggested that Lactobacillus acidophilus strain DDS-1 (LA1) has a suppressive effect on chemically induced tumors in experimental animals. In an effort to understand the possible mechanisms underlying this effect, we investigated the ability of LA1 to induce the production of interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), which have potent cytocidal and cytostatic effects on tumor cells. The mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 was incubated with live or heat-killed cells of four strains of L. acidophilus or Bifidobacterium bifidum. Escherichia coli was used as a source of lipopolysaccharide that is known to induce the above cytokines. The amount of the cytokines present in the culture fluid was quantitated by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. LA1 induced the production of higher levels of IL-1 alpha and TNF-alpha than other lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. Stimulation of the production of the cytokines was not due to the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) component, since LPS at concentrations equivalent to, or 100-fold greater than, that of LA1 induced only negligible amounts of IL-1 alpha and TNF-alpha. These results reveal that non-LPS component(s) of LA1 stimulate(s) the production of IL-1 alpha and TNF-alpha by macrophages, indicating that this organism stimulates the production of immunologic factors.
TI  - [The possibility of colonizing the intestines of white mice with Lactobacillus acidophilus during bacterial therapy].
AB  - The study revealed the possibility, on principle, for L. acidophilus strain VKM V-2020 D to colonize the intestine of white mice with the preservation of the viability of lactobacilli subjected to the action of antibiotics. The culture of this strain, isolated from the animals, showed the stability of its biological properties: resistance to polymyxin M, kanamycin, cyprofloxacin, nalidixic acid (including acquired resistance to rifampicin), as well as pronounced antagonism with respect to Vibrio cholerae. Good prospects for the use of L. acidophilus strain VKM V-2020 D for further studies regarding its use for prophylaxis and therapy were noted.
TI  - Antiproliferative effect of fermented milk on the growth of a human breast cancer cell line.
AB  - In vivo and in vitro studies have shown an antitumor activity of Lactobacilli in  colon cancer, and some epidemiologic studies have indicated a reduced risk of breast cancer in women who consume fermented milk products. We studied the direct effect of milk fermented by five bacteria strains (Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium animalis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus paracasei) on the growth of the MCF7 breast cancer cell line. Our results showed a growth inhibition induced by all fermented milks, even though B. infantis and L. acidophilus were the most effective (85% inhibition after 9 days). The antiproliferative effect was not related to the presence of bacteria in fermented milk, and neither whole milk (crude or ultrahigh temperature sterlizied) nor its main fractions (lactalbumin or beta-lactoglobulin fraction) affected cell growth. Our findings suggest the presence of an ex novo soluble compound produced by lactic acid bacteria during milk fermentation or the microbial transformation of some milk components in a biologically active form. Although the mechanism of the antitumor activity is not clear, the present study suggests the potentiality offered by fermented milk as producers of compounds with antiproliferative activity useful in the prevention and therapy of solid tumors like breast cancer.
TI  - Lactulose, lactic acid bacteria, intestinal microecology and mucosal protection.
AB  - During the fermentation of lactulose, short-chain fatty acids are formed with consequent lowering of the colon pH and modification of the microflora. Lactulose promotes the growth of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria and, more specifically, Lactobacillus acidophilus in the colon. Lactulose and lactulose-containing products fermented with lactic acid bacteria lower colonic pH balancing intestinal microecology and normalizing intestinal transit. In animal studies, lactulose promotes a mainly Gram-positive faecal microflora, but large doses of lactulose may be associated with transient diarrhoea. Our studies indicate that lactulose with lactic acid bacteria effectively relieves constipation in human volunteers. Lactulose with lactic acid bacteria in a fermented diary product can balance and prevent radiotherapy-associated diarrhoea and intestinal side effects. Normalizing the intestinal flora and stabilizing mucosal integrity with lactulose has beneficial effects in intestinal disorders. Lactulose and lactic acid bacteria offer a promising ingredient combination for future functional and special dietary foods in treating intestinal disturbances.
TI  - Probiotic fermentation: effect on antinutrients and digestibility of starch and protein of indigenously developed food mixture.
AB  - An indigenously developed food mixture which contained huskless barley flour, green gram dhal flour, skimmed milk powder and tomato pulp ("BGMT" mixture) was autoclaved, cooled and fermented with L. acidophilus at 37 degrees C for 24 h at a dosage of 100,000 cells/ml. This process markedly reduced the phytic acid and polyphenol content and significantly improved the in vitro digestibility of starch and protein. Starch digestibility almost doubled in the fermented mixture. A significant negative relationship was obtained between the contents of antinutrients and digestibility.
TI  - Effect of spray-dried yogurt and lactic acid bacteria on the initiation and promotion stages of chemically induced skin carcinogenesis in mice.
AB  - The effects of dietary spray-dried yogurt powder product (YPP) and two strains of lactic acid bacteria on the initiation and promotion stages of carcinogenesis were investigated using the 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) mouse skin carcinogenesis model. In two independent studies, Sencar mice were fed a diet containing 86%, 43%, or 0% YPP or the 0% YPP diet supplemented with viable cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus or bifidobacteria. Animals were initiated with a single topical application of DMBA (10 nmol). Promotion began three weeks later with twice weekly treatment of TPA (1 microgram/200 microliters acetone). During the initiation study (Study 1) the experimental diets were fed for four weeks before and one week after DMBA treatment. All mice were then switched to the AIN-76 diet. For the promotion study (Study 2) the experimental diets were begun one week after initiation and fed during the remainder of the study. Gross appearance of tumors was assessed weekly. No statistically significant differences in body weight or food disappearance were observed among the diet groups during the studies. For Studies 1 and 2, final histologically verified papilloma incidence and multiplicity and carcinoma incidence were not statistically different. These data suggest that different levels of YPP or lactic acid bacteria fed during the initiation or promotion stage of carcinogenesis do not significantly affect chemically induced skin tumor development.
TI  - Cloning and molecular analysis of promoter-like sequences isolated from the chromosomal DNA of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356.
AB  - Promoter-like sequences from the chromosomal DNA of thermophilic strain Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 were cloned. Analysis of the three DNA fragments showing promoter activity, designated P3, P6, and P15, were performed in Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactococcus lactis, and E. coli. The reporter cat-86 gene was expressed in all three bacterial species under control of the fragments P3 and P6. Fragment P15 showed promoter activity only in Lactobacillus reuteri and E. coli but not in Lactococcus lactis. The three host-specific transcriptional start points (TSPs) were used when transcription of the cat-86 gene was controlled by fragment P3 in Lactobacillus reuteri, E. coli, and Lactococcus lactis. Similarly, fragment P15 initiated transcription of the cat-86 gene at two distinctive sites in Lactobacillus reuteri and E. coli. Only within fragment P6, a common TSP was used in Lactobacillus reuteri and E. coli, but different from that used in Lactococcus lactis. Each TSP was preceded by the putative -35 and -10 hexamers. Computer analysis of the fragment P3 sequence revealed the existence of divergent promoter-like sequence (P3rev) located on the complementary DNA strand. Fragments P6 and P15 were also functional in Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 from which chromosomal DNA they were originally cloned.
TI  - Rapid detection method for bacteriocin and distribution of bacteriocin-producing  strains in Lactobacillus acidophilus group lactic acid bacteria isolated from human feces.
AB  - A new screening method, using micro plate wells, was developed for detecting the  bacteriocin producer in lactic acid bacteria. The method was applied for screening the bacteriocin producer in L. acidophilus group lactic acid bacteria isolated from human feces with 19 bacteria used as indicator strains. Of the 98 strains, 62 were finally selected as the bacteriocin producers, including 39 strains positive against at least one of food-borne pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Adhesion of Lactobacillus species in urine and phosphate buffer to silicone rubber and glass under flow.
AB  - Coating uroepithelial cells or catheter materials with lactobacilli has been shown to retard the development of a uropathogenic biofilm, with biosurfactant production and strong adhesion being two prerequisite properties of the Lactobacillus strains to be employed. In this paper, adhesion of six selected Lactobacillus strains to silicone rubber and glass in urine and in a phosphate buffer was studied using a parallel plate flow chamber. In addition, adhesive cell surface properties of the lactobacilli, i.e. the pH dependences of their zeta potentials and their hydrophobicities by water contact angles, were determined. L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 and L. fermentum B54 were the only strains showing significant adhesion to both hydrophobic silicone rubber and hydrophilic glass, possibly by virtue of their high cell surface hydrophobicities (water contact angles of 68 and 75 degrees, respectively) and small zeta potentials (-10.0 and -8.1 mV in buffer, respectively). Both hydrophobic Lactobacillus strains adhered less well in urine than in buffer. The remaining Lactobacillus strains studied were hydrophilic, with water contact angles between 25 and 36 degrees, and had highly negative zeta potentials, reaching -37.7 mV in buffer. Adhesion of these highly negatively charged, hydrophilic strains in buffer was essentially absent, while for some of these strains minor adhesion in urine was observed. This study demonstrates that the adhesion of lactobacilli to substrata differs with strain hydrophobicity and charge, and that urinary components can affect the ability of hydrophilic Lactobacillus strains to adhere to substrata.
TI  - Deoxycytidine kinase and deoxyguanosine kinase of Lactobacillus acidophilus R-26  are colinear products of a single gene.
AB  - Three of the four deoxynucleoside kinases required for growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus R-26 exist as heterodimeric pairs specific for deoxyadenosine (dAK) and deoxycytidine (dCK) or dAK and deoxyguanosine (dGK). However, only two tandem genes, dak/dgk, are found, and are expressed only as dAK/dGK in transformed Escherichia coli. Sequencing peptides spanning 63% of the native dCK subunit revealed a sequence identical to that deduced from dgk (beginning MTVIVL...), except that dCK lacks residues 2 and 3 (dCK is M..IVL; dGK is .TVIVL). Also, mass spectrometry indicates that native dCK and dGK subunits are identical in mass adjusted for the first three residues. Furthermore, the native enzymes have identical isoelectric pH values, indicating an equal number of charged residues. To enable E. coli to express peptide having the native dCK sequence, codons 2 and 3 were deleted from the dgk portion of the tandem genes, resulting in expression of protein having the specificities and regulatory properties of native dAK/dCK, including heterotropic stimulation of dAK activity by deoxycytidine or dCTP (not deoxyguanosine or dGTP) and end-product inhibition of the respective activities by dATP and dCTP. Subcloning normal and mutant dgk yielded homodimeric dGK and dCK, respectively. The dCK homodimer strongly resembles human dCK, with a low K(m) for deoxycytidine, the ability to phosphorylate deoxyadenosine and deoxyguanosine at much higher K(m) values, and end-product inhibition by dCTP. Thus two distinct and specific enzymes evidently are derived from a single Lactobacillus gene. The mechanism by which this occurs in vivo has yet to be elucidated.
TI  - Antagonistic activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus fermented milk against different pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus strains tested showed inhibitory activity towards Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris and Yersinia enterocolitica. However, wide variations in the activity of the strains were observed. Antagonistic activity of the strains exhibited high heat stability (120 min at 92 degrees C, 15 min at 121 degrees C) but it was markedly influenced by changes in pH. Effect of kind of milk on antagonistic activity was variable, whereas skimming had no significant effect.
TI  - Hypocholesterolemic action of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 43121 and calcium in swine with hypercholesterolemia induced by diet.
AB  - Thirty-three Yorkshire barrows (92 kg), fed a high cholesterol diet for 14 d had  mean concentrations of serum cholesterol of 294.6 +/- 7.8 mg/dl. Starting on d 15 and for an additional 15 d, crystalline cholesterol was removed from the diet and pigs were assigned to one of four treatments: including two levels of calcium (0.7% and 1.4%) with and without added viable Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 43121 (2.5 x 10(11) cells per feeding). Serum cholesterol levels decreased, as expected, for all groups. However, the declines were initiated sooner for the groups receiving L. acidophilus. and those receiving the high level of calcium than for the respective control groups. When averaged over days, pigs fed L. acidophilus had 11.8% lower total cholesterol than pigs fed a diet without L. acidophilus. Similarly, pigs fed 1.4% calcium had a significantly lower total cholesterol than pigs fed 0.7% calcium. The effects were greater on low density lipoprotein cholesterol than on high density lipoprotein cholesterol. In addition, during the overall 15-d experimental period, serum bile acids were reduced 23.9% by dietary L. acidophilus and by 21.4% by 1.4% dietary calcium compared with those of their controls. Total bile acid concentration was positively correlated with total cholesterol concentration for pigs fed L. acidophilus or 1.4% calcium. These data suggest that both L. acidophilus and calcium can enhance the reduction of serum cholesterol in pigs that had been fed a high cholesterol diet, probably through alteration in the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids.
TI  - Effects of a mixture of organisms, Lactobacillus acidophilus or Streptococcus faecalis on cholesterol metabolism in rats fed on a fat- and cholesterol-enriched diet.
AB  - The effect of a mixture of organisms (a probiotic mixture) comprising Bacillus, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Clostridium, Saccharomyces and Candida (10(7-8) colony-forming units/g rice bran of each component) on lipid metabolism was compared with that of L. acidophilus and that of S. faecalis. There were four treatment groups: rice bran (control), the mixture of organisms, L. acidophilus or S. faecalis (30 g/kg) were given to rats in a fat- and cholesterol-enriched diet for 4 weeks. The serum total cholesterol concentration of the group fed on the mixture of organisms was reduced by 15-33% compared with the other groups at the end of the 4-week feeding period (P < 0.05). This group also had a lower hepatic cholesterol concentration (36-44%) than the two single-bacteria groups (P < 0.05). 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Co A reductase (NADPH; EC 1.1.1.34) activities of the mixed-organism and L. acidophilus groups were significantly lower (61-63%) than those of the other groups (P < 0.05); the activity of the S. faecalis group was also significantly lower (42%) than that of the control group (P < 0.05). The faecal cholesterol and bile acid concentrations of the mixed-organism group increased compared with those of the L. acidophilus and S. faecalis groups (P < 0.05). The capacity of the mixed-organism cells to bind bile salt in vitro was significantly higher (approximately 50%) than that of the single-bacteria cells (P < 0.05). On the other hand, cholesterol micelle formation for the mixed-organism cells was significantly (approximately 9%) lower than that of the single-bacteria cells (P < 0.05). These results indicate that the mixture of organisms decreased the synthesis of cholesterol in the liver and increased the loss of steroids from the intestine, in rats. Thus, the mixture of organisms had a hypocholesterolaemic role.
TI  - Chemical composition of the cell wall of lactic acid bacteria and related species.
AB  - In order to examine the relationship between biological activities and the cell wall content, the murein type and the teichoic acid of the cell wall from five strains of bacteria were studied. Two of these Lactobacillus casei CRL 431 and L. acidophilus CRL 730, are used in a commercial fermented milk (BIO MILK), which is believed to be beneficial for health. The other strains, Lactococcus lactis CRL 526, Pediococcus pentosaceus CRL 923 and Propionibacterium acidipropionici CRL 1198 were included in order to compare the cell wall structures of active and inactive strains. A method was designed to confirm the amino acids of the peptidoglycan in impure substrates. Four of the studied strains, L. casei, L. acidophilus, L. lactis and P. acidipropionici, contained glycerol teichoic acids. L. casei, L. acidophilus, P. pentosaceus and L. lactis contained A4 alpha type murein, while P. acidipropionici contained A3 gamma type. The capacity of orally administered peptidoglycans of the studied strains to stimulate phagocytosis by mouse peritoneal macrophages was analyzed. Only the PG of L. casei showed this activity. No differences were observed between active and inactive strains with respect to the chemical composition of the peptidoglycan. Therefore the biological activity is unlikely to be due to the peptidoglycan structure.
TI  - Isolation, partial characterization and mode of action of acidocin J1229, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus JCM 1229.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus JCM 1229 produces a heat-stable bacteriocin, designated as acidocin J1229, that has a narrow inhibitory spectrum. Production of acidocin J1229 in MRS broth was pH dependent, with maximum activity detected in broth culture maintained at pH 5.0. Acidocin J1229 was purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation and sequential cation exchange and reversed-phase chromatographies. The sequence of the first 24 amino acid residues of the N terminus of acidocin J1229 was determined. The molecular mass of acidocin J1229 as determined by mass spectrometry was 6301 Da. Acidocin J1229 showed a bactericidal effect but not a bacteriolytic effect on sensitive cells. Acidocin J1229 dissipated the membrane potential and the pH gradient in sensitive cells, which affected such proton motive force-dependent processes as amino acid transport. Acidocin J1229 also caused an efflux of glutamate, previously taken up via a unidirectional ATP-driven transport system. Secondary structure prediction revealed the presence of an amphiphilic alpha-helix region that could form hydrophilic pores. These results suggest that acidocin J1229 is a pore-forming peptide that creates cell membrane channels through the "barrel-stave' mechanism.
TI  - Functional analysis of the gene encoding immunity to lactacin F, lafI, and its use as a Lactobacillus-specific, food-grade genetic marker.
AB  - Lactacin F is a two-component class II bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus johnsonii VPI 11088. The laf operon is composed of the bacteriocin structural genes, lafA and lafX, and a third open reading frame, ORFZ. Two strategies were employed to study the function of ORFZ. This gene was disrupted in the chromosome of NCK64, a lafA729 lafX ORFZ derivative of VPI 11088. A disruption cassette consisting of ORFZ interrupted with a cat gene was cloned into pSA3 and introduced into NCK64. Manipulation of growth temperatures and antibiotic selection resulted in homologous recombination which disrupted the chromosomal copy of ORFZ with the cat gene. This ORFZ mutation resulted in loss of immunity to lactacin F but had little effect on production of LafX, which is not bactericidal without LafA. Expression of ORFZ in this ORFZ- background rescued the immune phenotype. Expression of ORFZ in a bacteriocin-sensitive derivative of VPI 11088 also reestablished immunity. These data indicate that ORFZ, renamed lafI, encodes the immunity factor for the lactacin F system. The sensitivity of various Lactobacillus strains to lactacin F was further evaluated. Lactacin F inhibited 11 strains including several members of the A1, A2, A3, A4, B1, and B2 L. acidophilus homology groups. Expression of lafI in bacteriocin-sensitive strains L. acidophilus ATCC 4356, L. acidophilus NCFM/N2, L. fermentum NCDO1750, L. gasseri ATCC 33323, and L. johnsonii ATCC 33200 provided immunity to lactacin F. Furthermore, it was shown that lactacin F production by VPI 11088 could be used to select for L. fermentum NCDO1750 transformants containing the recombinant plasmid encoding LafI. The data demonstrate that lafI is functional in heterologous hosts, suggesting that it may be a suitable food-grade genetic marker for use in lactobacillus species.
TI  - [Clinical assessment of a new oral bacterial treatment for children with acute diarrhea].
AB  - This study was carried out to evaluate the efficacy of a new oral bacteriotherapeutic drug in 63 children under 4 years old affected by infective diarrhoea or by extraintestinal infective pathology caused by oral antibiotic therapy. The patients were divided into three groups: the first and the second included subjects affected by acute diarrhoea enrolled in a comparative and controlled study; the third included subjects in chemotherapeutic treatment because suffering from infective extraintestinal pathologies, these patients were enrolled in a not controlled study. The first group underwent the rehydratant treatment for the acute enteritis together with the therapy with inactivated Lactobacillus acidophilus LB to value its antidiarrheic activity. To the second group (control group) was administered a no bacteriotherapeutic drug, while to the third group was administered the antibiotic therapy for extra-intestinal pathologies together with inactivated Lactobacillus acidophilus to avoid possible phenomena due to intestinal dysmicrobism. For all the patients included in the study, were reported; the number, the characteristics, the consistency of the motions and the description of the symptomatology during the treatment and daily. The greater part of the patients affected by the intestinal infective pathology subdued bacteriologic tests by coproculture. The obtained results showed a statistically significant clinical improvement of the first group patients compared with those of the second group, while those of the third group showed that the drug activity prevents the intestinal dysmicrobism affections due to the antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Digestion and tolerance of lactose from yoghurt and different semi-solid fermented dairy products containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacteria in lactose maldigesters--is bacterial lactase important?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the digestibility and tolerance of lactose from three semi-solid fermented dairy products with the same amount of lactose but different lactase contents and bacterial cultures in lactase deficient adults. DESIGN: Measurement of breath hydrogen (H2) concentration and of clinical symptoms after consumption of the test meals. SETTING: Metabolic ward for healthy volunteers, INSERM U290, Hopital St. Lazare, Paris. SUBJECTS: Fifteen lactase-deficient healthy adult volunteers (20-45 y) started the study. One subject became a non-H2-producer during the study; therefore the results of 14 subjects are presented. INTERVENTION: Each subject consumed, on four different days and in random order, after a 12 h fast, three semisolid test meals containing 18 g of lactose, and a 10 g dose of lactulose which allowed calculation of lactose malabsorption. The three meals were: traditional yoghurt, fermented milk (Ofilus) that contained Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium sp., and a similar product 'Bulgofilus' enriched with Lactobacillus bulgaricus to increase the lactase content. RESULTS: Compared with lactulose, the sum of symptoms was significantly lower for Bulgofilus (P = 0.05), and bloating was less severe for Ofilus (P = 0.06). Between the fermented milks, there were no differences. The area under the breath H2 curve was significantly lower for each fermented milk when compared to lactulose (P < 0.0001). The degree of maldigestion of lactose did not differ significantly between the products; it was 21 +/- 3% (range 6-52) for Ofilus, 21 +/- 3% (range 6-44) for Bulgofilus, and 18 +/- 3% (range 3-43) for yoghurt. CONCLUSION: Despite the differences in the lactase and bacterial content, lactose was as well digested and tolerated from the three different semi-sold fermented dairy products. This could be due to a slow gastric emptying of the semi-solid milk.
TI  - Ingestion of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus compared with pasteurized yogurt as prophylaxis for recurrent candidal vaginitis and bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - To compare and assess ingestion of yogurt that contained live Lactobacillus acidophilus with pasteurized yogurt as prophylaxis for recurrent bacterial vaginosis (BV) and candidal vaginitis, we designed a crossover trial during which patients were examined monthly for candidal infection and BV while they were receiving either a pasteurized yogurt or a yogurt that contained live L acidophilus. Forty-six patients in 2 groups of 23 were randomly assigned to each of the study groups. At least 28 (61%) participated during the first 4 months of the study. Seven patients completed the entire study protocol. We concluded that daily ingestion of 150 mL of yogurt, enriched with live L acidophilus, was associated with an increased prevalence of colonization of the rectum and vagina by the bacteria, and this ingestion of yogurt may have reduced episodes of BV.
TI  - Absence of bacterial DNA in the bladder of patients with interstitial cystitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: Although bacterial infection has been long considered a possible cause of interstitial cystitis (IC), no definitive proof for or against this hypothesis has been presented so far. We have used 16S rDNA bacterial polymerase chain reaction to study bladder biopsies and sterile urine samples from patients suffering from IC. This method is sensitive and detects all known eubacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bladder biopsies and sterile urine samples obtained by transabdominal puncture were studied from 11 patients with IC. As controls we studied 4 patients with other urological problems leading to partly similar symptoms and 5 healthy individuals. RESULTS: All samples from the IC patients were negative. One positive sample was obtained from a woman with a history of urinary tract infections who suffered from nonIC ulcerative cystitis. Her sterile urine sample yielded Lactobacillus acidophilus. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that an ongoing bacterial infection is not the cause of interstitial cystitis.
TI  - A new screening method for the selection of Lactobacillus acidophilus group lactic acid bacteria with high adhesion to human colonic mucosa.
AB  - A hemagglutination (HA) assay was done for the screening of lectin-like components in surface layer protein (SLP) from Lactobacillus (L.) acidophilus A group strains. The new screening method, using polystyrene beads coated with rat-colonic mucin (RCM), which combines sugar chains similar to those of human colonic mucin, was also done. The results showed that the HA assay was not a good indicator for selecting strains having high adhesion to the human intestinal tract. The SLPs from 3 strains that strongly bound to RCM also bound well to carbohydrate portions of Carnoy's-fixed human colonic mucous layer. These results suggest that this method is a new promising screening technique for the L. acidophilus strains having high adhesion to the human intestinal tract.
TI  - Evaluation of media for selective enumeration of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacteria.
AB  - Fifteen media were evaluated to determine their suitability for selective enumeration of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacteria using 5 to 6 strains of each of the four groups of organisms. Streptococcus thermophilus agar was found to be suitable for selective enumeration of S. thermophilus under aerobic incubation at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The MRS agar at pH 5.2 or reinforced clostridial agar at pH 5.3 could be used for the selective enumeration of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus when the incubation was carried out at 45 degrees C for > or = 72 h. However, the recovery of this organism was lower on MRS agar at pH 5.2 or reinforced clostridial agar at pH 5.3 than that obtained on MRS agar. The recovery of L. acidophilus and bifidobacteria on MRS agar and MRS-maltose agar was similar; MRS-maltose agar could be used to enumerate total counts of L. acidophilus and bifidobacteria. For selective enumeration of L. acidophilus, MRS-salicin agar or MRS-sorbitol agar could be used. For selective enumeration of bifidobacteria, MRS NNLP (nalidixic acid, neomycin sulfate, lithium chloride, and paromomycin sulfate) agar was suitable; however, determination of bifidobacteria by differential counts between L. acidophilus enumerated on MRS-salicin agar or MRS-sorbitol agar and the total counts of L. acidophilus and bifidobacteria obtained from MRS-maltose agar resulted in higher recovery of some strains of bifidobacteria. Other media that were evaluated in this study were not suitable for selective enumeration.
TI  - Expression, secretion and antigenic variation of bacterial S-layer proteins.
AB  - The function of the S-layer, a regularly arranged structure on the outside of numerous bacteria, appears to be different for bacteria living in different environments. Almost no similarity exists between the primary sequences of S-proteins, although their amino acid composition is comparable. S-protein production is directed by single or multiple promoters in front of the S-protein gene, yielding stable mRNAs. Most bacteria secrete S-proteins via the general secretory pathway (GSP). Translocation of S-protein across the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria sometimes occurs by S-protein-specific branches of the GSP. O-polysaccharide side-chains of the lipopolysaccharide component of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria appear to function as receptors for attachment of the S-layer. Silent S-protein genes have been found in Campylobacter fetus and Lactobacillus acidophilus. These silent genes are placed in the expression site in a fraction of the bacterial population via inversion of a chromosomal segment.
TI  - The presence of two S-layer-protein-encoding genes is conserved among species related to Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Previously we have shown that the type strain of Lactobacillus acidophilus possesses two S-protein-encoding genes, one of which is silent, on a chromosomal segment of 6 kb. The S-protein-encoding gene in the expression site can be exchanged for the silent S-protein-encoding gene by inversion of this slp segment. In this study the presence of S-protein and corresponding S-protein-encoding genes of strains belonging to species that are closely related to L. acidophilus was determined. All strains investigated were identified by numerical comparison of highly standardized one-dimensional SDS-PAGE whole-cellular-protein patterns. Western blot and Southern blot methods were used to identify the presence of, and homology between, S-proteins and S-protein-encoding genes. From these analyses we conclude that strains of L. acidophilus, L. crispatus, L. amylovorus and L. gallinarum possess an S-layer and contain two slp genes. Strains of L. helveticus possess an S-layer but have only one intact slp gene. Strains of L. gasseri, L. johnsonii and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus have neither an S-layer nor S-protein-encoding genes hybridizing with probes derived from the L. acidophilus slpA or slpB region. The presence of a highly conserved 5' region in the slp genes of strains of L. acidophilus, L. crispatus, L. amylovorus and L. gallinarum suggests that S-layer variation is a common feature for strains of these species.
TI  - The Lactobacillus acidophilus S-layer protein gene expression site comprises two  consensus promoter sequences, one of which directs transcription of stable mRNA.
AB  - S-proteins are proteins which form a regular structure (S-layer) on the outside of the cell walls of many bacteria. Two S-protein-encoding genes are located in opposite directions on a 6.0-kb segment of the chromosome of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 bacteria. Inversion of this chromosomal segment occurs through recombination between two regions with identical sequences, thereby interchanging the expressed and the silent genes. In this study, we show that the region involved in recombination also has a function in efficient S-protein production. Two promoter sequences are present in the S-protein gene expression site, although only the most downstream promoter (P-1) is used to direct mRNA synthesis. S-protein mRNA directed by this promoter has a half-life of 15 min. Its untranslated leader can form a stable secondary structure in which the 5' end is base paired, whereas the ribosome-binding site is exposed. Truncation of this leader sequence results in a reduction in protein production, as shown by reporter gene analysis of Lactobacillus casei. The results obtained indicate that the untranslated leader sequence of S-protein mRNA is involved in efficient S-protein production.
TI  - Interchange of the active and silent S-layer protein genes of Lactobacillus acidophilus by inversion of the chromosomal slp segment.
AB  - The most-dominant surface-exposed protein in many bacterial species is the S-protein. This protein crystallises into a regular monolayer on the outside surface of the bacteria: the S-layer. Lactobacillus acidophilus harbours two S-protein-encoding genes, slpA and slpB, only one of which (slpA) is expressed. In this study, we show by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis that slpA and slpB are located on a 6 kb chromosomal segment, in opposite or orientations. In a small fraction of the bacterial population, this segment is inverted. The inversion leads to interchanging of the expressed and silent S-protein-encoding genes, and places the formerly silent gene behind the S-promoter which is located outside the inverted segment. A 26 bp sequence showing a high degree of similarity with the consensus sequence recognized by the Din family of invertases is present in the region where recombination occurs. Expression of the slpA gene seems to be favoured under laboratory growth conditions because 99.7% of the chromosomes of an L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 broth culture had the slpA gene present at the slp expression site.
TI  - Identification and plasmid profiles of Lactobacillus species from the vagina of 100 healthy women.
AB  - It was hypothesized that Lactobacillus acidophilus might not be the dominant aerobic or microaerophilic Lactobacillus species in the human vagina, and that the dominant isolates are likely to express a variety of properties associated with colonization. To examine the question, vaginal swabs were collected from 100 healthy premenopausal women and cultured to detect the dominant aerobic or microaerophilic isolates of Lactobacillus. Only eight species were detected, with Lactobacillus jensenii being the dominant colonizers in the highest number (35) of women. Twelve different plasmid profiles were found amongst the isolates, but there was no association between plasmids and vaginal colonization or hydrogen peroxide production. Of the strains tested, few were resistant to the spermicidal agent nonoxynol-9. The data identify species within which strains may possess properties associated with maintenance of a healthy vaginal ecology.
TI  - Effect of adherent Lactobacillus spp. on in vitro adherence of salmonellae to the intestinal epithelial cells of chicken.
AB  - Single strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lact. fermentum, isolated from chicken intestine, were used to study in vitro interactions with Salmonella enteritidis, Salm. pullorum or Salm. typhimurium in an ileal epithelial cell (IEC) radioactive assay. Exclusion, competition and displacement phenomena were investigated by respectively incubating (a) lactobacilli and IEC together, prior to addition of salmonellae, (b) lactobacilli, IEC and salmonellae together, and (c) salmonellae and IEC, followed by the lactobacilli. Lactobacilli were selected for study because of their strong ability to adhere to IEC and poor aggregation with salmonellae. The results demonstrated that Lact. acidophilus significantly reduced (P < 0.05) the attachment of Salm. pullorum to IEC in the tests for exclusion and competition, but not in the displacement tests. Lactobacillus fermentum was found to have some ability to reduce the attachment of Salm. typhimurium to IEC under the conditions of exclusion (P < 0.08), competition (P < 0.09), but not displacement. However, both Lact. acidophilus and Lact. fermentum were unable to reduce the adherence of Salm. enteritidis to IEC under any of the conditions.
TI  - Structural characterization of the exopolysaccharide produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus LMG9433.
AB  - The exopolysaccharide produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus LMG9433 in a semi-defined medium was found to be a charged heteropolymer, with a composition of D-glucose, D-galactose, D-glucuronic acid, and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucose in molar ratios of 2:1:1:1. By means of methylation analysis, uronic acid degradation, de-N-acetylation/deamination, partial acid hydrolysis, and 1D/2D NMR studies the polysaccharide was demonstrated to consist of repeating units with the following structure: [Table: see text]
TI  - Cloning and expression of human mitochondrial deoxyguanosine kinase cDNA.
AB  - Mammalian mitochondrial deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK) is responsible for phosphorylation of purine deoxyribonucleosides in the mitochondrial matrix. Using a RT-PCR-generated probe, based on amino acid sequence information from proteolytic fragments of purified bovine dGK, we have cloned a cDNA from a human brain cDNA library that encodes a 30 kDa protein. The deduced amino acid sequence of this protein included the sequence of all six peptides isolated and sequenced from purified dGK. Expression and purification of recombinant protein from induced Escherichia coli extracts revealed that it catalyses efficient phosphorylation of dGuo, arabinosyl guanine, dAdo, 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine and dIno similar to purified dGK. Northern blot analysis demonstrated one dominant positive mRNA of 1.35 kb and it was found in several tissues at similar levels. The coding sequence of dGK showed 46% identity to the coding sequence of cytosolic deoxycytidine kinase, and conserved sequence motifs among the known deoxynucleoside kinase were identified.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of 10% carbamide peroxide bleaching agents.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of three commercial 10% carbamide peroxide bleaching agents (Nite White, Karisma, and Opalescence) on Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguis, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus was examined. Chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as a positive control. Test materials and control solution were inserted in wells punched on the surface of disk sensitivity agars seeded with bacteria. After incubation of 24 to 48 h, zones of inhibition were measured. All three of the test materials displayed greater inhibition than the control. The pH of the solutions did not effect the bacterial inhibition.
TI  - Performance of commercial cultures in fluid milk applications.
AB  - Six Lactobacillus acidophilus, 5 Bifidobacterium, and 6 Streptococcus thermophilus strains were studied for characteristics that are important to activity and stability in unfermented fluid milk products. Speciation, strain relatedness, frozen concentrate stability, bile sensitivity, and lactase activity were evaluated. The microbiological stability of a culture-containing fluid milk product was also determined. Two of the bifidobacteria cultures contained > 1 strain. Some strains were shown to be closely related or identical by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of fragmented chromosomal DNA. Selective media that distinguished among all 3 added genera were identified. All lactobacilli and most of the bifidobacteria were resistant to bile concentrations varying from 1 to 3%, and all streptococci were sensitive to bile. Lactase activities were highest for S. thermophilus strains, supporting use of this species in fluid milk and dairy products to aid in the digestion of lactose by consumers. The experimental product evaluated in this study contained 10(7) cfu/ml of both L. Acidophilus and Bifidobacterium spp. and 5 x 10(7) cfu/ml of S. thermophilus. Lactic, but not psychrotrophic, populations were fairly stable during storage. The results suggest that milk formulated with high concentrations of three different genera of probiotic bacteria can be manufactured with commercial strains.
TI  - Homofermentative Lactobacillus species predominantly isolated from canine feces.
AB  - Lactobacillus salivarius group biovars VIa and VIb, which are homofermentative Lactobacillus, were predominantly isolated from canine feces. Identification and biotyping of L. salivarius group biovars VIa and VIb were originally done by Mitsuoka et al. (1976). These strains were tentatively identified as L. salivarius by their phenotypic characteristics. They are, however, more similar to those of some new Lactobacillus species, particularly L. animalis and L. murinus, than those of L. salivarius and have now been identified as L. animalis by DNA-DNA homology.
TI  - Analysis of Lactobacillus phages and bacteriocins in American dairy products and  characterization of a phage isolated from yogurt.
AB  - Yogurt and acidophilus milk that contain Lactobacillus acidophilus could promote  human health because L. acidophilus can inhibit enteric and food-borne microbial pathogens. To evaluate the stability of diary L. acidophilus cultures, we studied whether some diary lactobacilli could be inhibited by phages or bacteriocins released by other dairy lactobacilli. From 20 yogurts and two acidophilus milks purchased at local food markets, 38 Lactobacillus strains were isolated. Eight Lactobacillus type strains were used as controls. With mitomycin induction and agar spot assay, phages and bacteriocins were isolated from these strains and their activities were analyzed. Lactobacillus strains from 11 yogurts released phages, while the strains from most of the remaining products released bacteriocins. One phage, designated phi y8, was characterized. It was spontaneously released from its host strain L. acidophilus Y8, at a rate of about 10(4)/ml. This phage lysed nine other dairy Lactobacillus strains tested. It had a burst size of 100, an elongated prolate head of 39 by 130 nm, a long, flexible but noncontractile tail of 300 nm, and a 54.3-kb linear double-stranded DNA. DNA fingerprinting analysis indicated that L. acidophilus phages of nine yogurts in this study belonged to the same type as phi y8. Although they may be sensitive to bacteriocins, all lysogens resisted further phage attacks, whereas most nonlysogens were sensitive to both phages and bacteriocins. Therefore, Lacotbacillus cultures of some American yogurts and acidophilus milks may be unstable or unsafe because they can either be inhibited by phages or bacteriocins or release them to inhibit lactobacilli or other diary products.
TI  - Inhibition of initial adhesion of uropathogenic Enterococcus faecalis by biosurfactants from Lactobacillus isolates.
AB  - In this study, 15 Lactobacillus isolates were found to produce biosurfactants in  the mid-exponential and stationary growth phases. The stationary-phase biosurfactants from lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus 36 and ATCC 7469, Lactobacillus fermentum B54, and Lactobacillus acidophilus RC14 were investigated further to determine their capacity to inhibit the initial adhesion of uropathogenic Enterococcus faecalis 1131 to glass in a parallel-plate flow chamber. The initial deposition rate of E. faecalis to glass with an adsorbed biosurfactant layer from L. acidophilus RC14 or L. fermentum B54 was significantly decreased by approximately 70%, while the number of adhering enterococci after 4 h of adhesion was reduced by an average of 77%. The surface activity of the biosurfactants and their activity inhibiting the initial adhesion of E. faecalis 1131 were retained after dialysis (molecular weight cutoff, 6,000 to 8,000) and freeze-drying. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the freeze-dried biosurfactants from L. acidophilus RC14 and L. fermentum B54 were richest in protein, while those from L. casei subsp. rhamnosus 36 and ATCC 7469 had relatively high polysaccharide and phosphate contents.
TI  - An assessment of the Sartorius MD8 microbiological air sampler.
AB  - Tests described in this paper show that gelatine membrane filters used in the MD8 microbiological air sampling system collected monodispersed aerosols between 0.7 and 1.0 microns containing viable Bacillus subtilis var. niger spores, with an efficiency of 99.9995%. Gelatine membrane filters linked to the MD8 control pump system were as effective as the well established Casella slit-to-agar device for collecting some viable bacteria, nebulized under controlled experimental conditions and naturally occurring airborne micro-organisms in a pharmaceutical plant. By using a long flexible hose connection to the control pump, the head could be positioned where sampling was required in locations remote from the pump exhaust, making it suitable for microbiological monitoring in critical locations such as laminar flow stations and isolators.
TI  - Electrotransformation of lactobacillus acidophilus group A1.
AB  - Two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus Group A1, the neotype ATCC 4356 and a human isolate NCFM-N2, widely used as a dietary adjunct in milk and cultured dairy products, were transformed with plasmid DNA by electroporation. The transformation characteristics exhibited by the two L acidophilus strains were found to differ markedly even though they appeared similar at the genomic level based on the DNA patterns of SmaI restriction fragments. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a consistent, reproducible transformation system of Lactobacillus acidophilus strains comprising the A1 DNA homology group.
TI  - Effect of administration of milk fermented with Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-2 on fecal mutagenicity and microflora in the human intestine.
AB  - To demonstrate the antimutagenic effect of fermented milk in the human intestine, fecal mutagenicity and bacterial composition of six healthy subjects consuming their regular diet were investigated before and during the administration of milk fermented with Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-2. The administration of the fermented milk caused a remarkable decrease (71.9% on the average; range of 19.4 to 90.6%) in fecal mutagenicity compared with that before the administration; Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. population increased in the feces of all subjects. The suppression of fecal mutagenicity appeared to be due to the change in fecal microflora caused by the presence of strain LA-2 in the human intestine.
TI  - Effect of probiotic supplementation on growth, nitrogen utilisation and serum cholesterol in broilers.
AB  - 1. The effect of dietary probiotic supplementation on the growth, nitrogen utilisation and serum cholesterol content of broiler chickens was studied in 2 trials. 2. In experiment 1, the birds receiving the 0, 75, 100, 125 mg probiotic/kg diets had weight gains of 1204.0, 1272.0, 1268.3 and 1210.5, respectively at the end of 8 weeks of feeding. The group of birds fed on the 75 mg probiotic supplemented diet retained significantly (P < 0.01) more nitrogen than the control birds. Serum cholesterol content was lower in the probiotic-supplemented birds (93.3 mg/100 ml) compared to the control birds (132.2 mg/100 ml). 3. In the second experiment the probiotic plus antibiotic-supplemented group of birds had the maximum weight gain (1148.5 g) followed by antibiotic (1141.3 g), probiotic-supplemented (1128.4 g) and control birds (1045.6 g) after 6 weeks. Nitrogen retention was greatest in the antibiotic--(48.5%) followed by the probiotic--(46.5%), probiotic plus antibiotic-supplemented groups (46.3%) compared to 40.2% in control birds. 4. The apparent metabolisable energy was greatest in birds receiving the probiotic plus antibiotic-supplemented diet (12.37 MJ/kg) followed by antibiotic--(12.00 MJ/kg), probiotic-supplemented birds (11.92 MJ/kg) than in control birds (11.62 MJ/kg). Serum cholesterol was significantly (P < 0.01) lower in probiotic-supplemented birds (86.1 mg/dl) compared to 118.4 mg/dl in control birds.
TI  - The influence of Lactobacillus acidophilus and bacitracin on layer performance of chickens and cholesterol content of plasma and egg yolk.
AB  - 1. The influence of Lactobacillus acidophilus alone or in combination with zinc bacitracin on the performance of laying hens was monitored over a period of 4 months. 2. Lactobacillus acidophilus improved egg production, food conversion and reduced the cholesterol concentration in the eggs, but zinc bacitracin had no effect when administered alone. 3. In combination, bacitracin had an adverse effect on the otherwise beneficial activity of the culture.
TI  - Effect of various types of fermentation on in vitro protein and starch digestibility of differently processed pearl millet.
AB  - Pearl millet (Pennisetum typhoideum) grains were fermented with Lactobacilli and  yeast alone, in combination and with natural flora at 30 degrees C for 48 h after giving various processing treatments viz, fine and coarse grinding, soaking, debranning, dry heat treatment, germination and autoclaving after adding of water. Fermentation was carried out with Lactobacillus acidophilus and Rhodotorula isolated from naturally fermented pearl millet and Lactobacillus acidophilus, Candida utilis and natural fermentation using freshly ground pearl millet flour as inoculum. All the processing treatments except coarse grinding improved the protein and starch digestibility. Autoclaving enhanced the digestibilities of processed samples which was further improved by different types of fermentation, the maximum being in case of germinated and naturally fermented pearl millet. A combination of Lactobacilli and yeast was more effective in increasing the protein as well as starch digestibility as compared to pure culture fermentation.
TI  - Construction of an integrative food-grade cloning vector for Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - An integrative cloning vector was constructed using a randomly cloned HindIII-digested chromosomal fragment from Lactobacillus acidophilus ADH inserted into an Escherichia coli vector, pBluescript II SK+. Southern hybridization studies demonstrated homology of the inserted fragment with one other L. acidophilus strain and one Bifidobacterium strain. Identification of a SauI site located near the middle of the 1.9-kb ADH chromosomal fragment made it possible to clone the Lactobacillus bulgaricus beta-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23) gene into this vector. The vector was unable to replicate in the homologous host, L. acidophilus ADH, following electroporation. The chromosomal fragment allowed the integration of the beta-galactosidase gene (beta gal) into the host chromosome via homologous recombination. The size of the two flanking L. acidophilus ADH chromosomal fragments, approximately 0.95 kb each, was sufficient to allow the double cross-over to take place. Southern hybridization demonstrated that only L. acidophilus and L. bulgaricus DNA had been integrated into the chromosome of the host strain. The beta-galactosidase activity of the transformant was increased approximately 200-fold when compared to the enzyme activity of the wild-type strain. The beta gal gene remained stable in the transformant strain after 30 transfers in growth media without selection pressure. This first-generation integrative cloning vector is constructed solely of DNA from organisms consumed by humans and could be considered a food-grade vector system.
TI  - Probiotics, cecal microflora, and aberrant crypts in the rat colon.
AB  - Our hypothesis was that administration of bifidobacteria, Lactobacillus acidophilus or both to rats will minimize the numbers of aberrant crypts in the distal colon that develop in response to the carcinogen 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH). A series of experiments was designed to test this hypothesis where the treatments used were as follows: skim milk controls (Skim-Basal), skim milk + bifidobacteria (Bifido-Basal), skim milk + fructooligosaccharide (Skim-FOS), and skim milk + bifidobacteria + fructooligosaccharide (Bifido-FOS). In two experiments, bifido-bacteria + FOS administration significantly decreased the number of aberrant crypts that developed, but there was no clear relationship of aberrant crypts to numbers of bifidobacteria or Clostridium perfringens. In the third experiment, the Bifido-FOS treatment led to significantly fewer aberrant crypts and aberrant crypt foci than the Bifido-Basal treatment. The Skim-FOS group had significantly more cecal bifidobacteria than the Skim-Basal group and significantly fewer C. perfringens than the Skim-Basal and Bifido-Basal. In a fourth experiment, L. acidophilus was added as an additional treatment. The number of aberrant crypts was not significantly different among the groups. However, the number of C. perfringens was significantly decreased by the addition of bifidobacteria, L. acidophilus or the combination of the two, whereas the numbers of bifidobacteria and L. acidophilus were not affected by treatment. A significant correlation (R2 = 0.84, P < 0.01) was noted between the body weight of rats at DMH administration and the magnitude of the difference in aberrant crypts between the Skim-Basal rats and the Bifido-FOS rats. The results suggest that there is variability in the effects of bifidobacteria and L. acidophilus administration on both aberrant crypt formation and C. perfringens.
TI  - PCR detection and quantitation of predominant anaerobic bacteria in human and animal fecal samples.
AB  - PCR procedures based on 16S rRNA gene sequences specific for 12 anaerobic bacteria that predominate in the human intestinal tract were developed and used for quantitative detection of these species in human (adult and baby) feces and animal (rat, mouse, cat, dog, monkey, and rabbit) feces. Fusobacterium prausnitzii, Peptostreptococcus productus, and Clostridium clostridiiforme had high PCR titers (the maximum dilutions for positive PCR results ranged from 10(-3) to 10(-8)) in all of the human and animal fecal samples tested. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides vulgatus, and Eubacterium limosum also showed higher PCR titers (10(-2) to 10(-6)) in adult human feces. The other bacteria tested, including Escherichia coli, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Eubacterium biforme, and Bacteroides distasonis, were either at low PCR titers (less than 10(-2)) or not detected by PCR. The reported PCR procedure including the fecal sample preparation method is simplified and rapid and eliminates the DNA isolation steps.
TI  - Levels of antinutritional factors in pearl millet as affected by processing treatments and various types of fermentation.
AB  - Pearl millet (Pennisetum typhoideum) was fermented with Lactobacilli or yeasts alone and in combination, and with natural microflora after various processing treatments, as grinding, soaking, debranning, dry heat treatment, autoclaving and germination. Fermentation was carried out at 30 degrees C for 48 hours with Lactobacillus plantarum (LP) and Rhodotorula (R) isolated from naturally fermented pearl millet and Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA), Candida utilis (CU) and natural microflora (NF). Germination and autoclaving, and debranning and autoclaving were the most effective processing treatments to reduce the phytic acid, amylase inhibitors and polyphenols. There was a further reduction in these antinutrients due to fermentation. Phytic acid and amylase inhibitors were completely eliminated after fermentation in some of the samples especially in soaked, debranned and germinated ones. Polyphenols were altered non-significantly in general but fermentation with Lp + R and NF caused a significant increase in polyphenols.
TI  - The effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus on the production and chemical composition of hen's eggs.
AB  - Laying hens were fed for a 48-wk period with a basal diet supplemented with a selected strain of Lactobacillus acidophilus at levels up to four million viable cells per gram of feed. Levels of egg production and feed conversion were significantly higher (8 and 14.8%, respectively) than in the control flock, and cholesterol values in yolks were decreased by 18.8%. It is suggested that the latter effect was a reflection of lower serum cholesterol concentrations in treated birds; a maximum reduction of over 55% followed incorporation of the culture into the feed. The level of viable cells in the feed was confirmed as being critical to register the above effects.
TI  - Composition of the Lactobacillus acidophilus complex isolated from vaginal flora.
AB  - One hundred and fifty human vaginal samples containing a diversity of pathogens or nonpathogens (Gardnerella vaginalis, Streptococcus sp., Staphylococcus sp., Candida albicans. Mycoplasma sp.) were examined for their content in lactobacilli of the Lactobacillus acidophilus complex. Although all samples contained lactobacilli, strains of the L. acidophilus complex were present in only twenty-nine cases. Isolates were further characterized and compared with type strains or reference strains in an attempt to differentiate by phenotypic means the genospecies of the L. acidophilus complex. Data regarding specific activities of beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) and of phospho-beta-galactosidase (P-beta-gal) provided no specific information at the species level within the L. acidophilus complex. DNA-relatedness differentiates this genospecies. Most lactobacilli isolated from the vaginal flora of symptomatic women were genotypically close to L. gasseri CIP 102991T by the technique of DNA/DNA hybridization.
TI  - Humoral immune responses against particulate bacterial antigens are dependent on  marginal metallophilic macrophages in the spleen.
AB  - Lymphoid organs are populated by different macrophage subpopulations. In the spleen, four subpopulations can be characterized using differences in, for example, morphology, localization, cell markers and repopulation kinetics after liposome-mediated depletion. The involvement of the different macrophage subpopulations in the immune response to particulate antigens was studied in vivo by intravenous injection of clodronate containing liposomes to eliminate the splenic macrophages, followed by immunization with trinitrophenylated Brucella abortus (TNP-BA; thymus-independent (TI)) or TNP-Lactobacillus acidophilus (TNP-LB; thymus-dependent (TD)) at different time intervals. A strong decrease in the number of antibody-secreting cells (ASC) against TNP-LB was measured after elimination of all splenic macrophages. When TNP-LB was injected after repopulation of the red pulp macrophages (completed after 2 weeks), the ASC response was still strongly reduced. Restoration of the capacity to mount an immune response correlated well with the reappearance of the marginal metallophilic macrophages. It is concluded that this particular subset of macrophages is involved in the immune response to these particulate bacterial TD antigens. In contrast, the response against the particulate bacterial TI antigen TNP-BA was not impaired after depletion of splenic macrophages, although apparent changes in IgG isotypes were observed.
TI  - Behaviour of Yersinia enterocolitica and Aeromonas hydrophila in skim milk during fermentation by various lactobacilli.
AB  - In this study, behaviour of Yersinia enterocolitica and Aeromonas hydrophila in skim milk during fermentation by various Lactobacillus sp. were determined. pH values of the skim milk samples were also examined during fermentation. The amount of produced lactic acid and diacetyl/acetoin productions of the Lactobacillus sp. were estimated. Antimicrobial effects of the lactobacilli on Y. enterocolitica and A. hydrophila were also determined by an agar diffusion method. While Y. enterocolitica was not inhibited and grew during fermentation, A. hydrophila was inhibited, in part, and the growth was retarded. Results were supported by the agar diffusion method for Y. enterocolitica, whereas inhibition activity was not found for A. hydrophila. The highest lactic acid productions were estimated in L. bulgaricus (7.50 mg/ml) and L. acidophilus (5.63 mg/ml) and four out of six Lactobacillus sp. were found to be diacetyl/acetoin producers.
TI  - Biotherapeutic agents. A neglected modality for the treatment and prevention of selected intestinal and vaginal infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential of biotherapeutic agents (microorganisms with therapeutic properties) for the prevention and/or treatment of selected intestinal and vaginal infections. DATA SOURCES: The MEDLINE database was searched for all relevant articles published between 1966 and September 1995. Search terms used were biotherapeutic agent, probiotic, Lactobacillus, Saccharomyces, Bifidobacterium, Candida, gastrointestinal- system, vaginitis, vaginosis-bacterial, and related terms. The bibliographies of obtained articles were also reviewed. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All placebo-controlled human studies on biotherapeutic agents were reviewed. English-language open trials, case series and reports, and animal studies were reviewed only if they were especially relevant to providing information on the potential efficacy, adverse effects, or mechanisms of action of these agents. DATA SYNTHESIS: Placebo-controlled studies have shown that biotherapeutic agents have been used successfully to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea (Lactobacillus caseiGG, bifidobacterium longum, B longum with L acidophilus, and Saccharomyces boulardii), to prevent acute infantile diarrhea (Bifidobacterium bifidum with Streptococcus thermophilus), to treat recurrent Clostridium difficile disease (S boulardii), and to treat various other diarrheal illnesses (Enterococcus faecium SF68, L caseiGG, and S boulardii). There is also evidence for Lactobacillus acidophilus in the prevention of candidal vaginitis. Few adverse effects have been reported. However, many of the studies tested only small numbers of patients or volunteers. CONCLUSIONS: There is now evidence that administration of selected microorganisms is beneficial in the prevention and treatment of certain intestinal and, possibly, treatment of vaginal infections. In an effort to decrease the reliance on antimicrobials, the time has come to carefully explore the therapeutic applications of biotherapeutic agents.
TI  - Probiotics and colon cancer prevention.
AB  - This review examines some of the evidence regarding probiotic bacteria as agents  to reduce the risk of colon cancer in humans. While some of the evidence using rodent models of colon cancer is convincing for a reduction in cancer incidence and burden with the introduction orally of such bacteria as Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus acidophilus and gg, convincing evidence in humans is more difficult to find. It consists of epidemiological studies or marker intervention studies using faecal enzymes, faecal bile acids or urinary/ faecal mutagens from microbial activity as measures of cancer risk, following probiotic introduction. Taken together these sources of data provide limited support for the hypothesis that probiotic bacteria are effective in cancer prevention.
TI  - Isolation, partial characterization, and mode of action of Acidocin J1132, a two-component bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus JCM 1132.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus JCM 1132 produces a heat-stable, two-component bacteriocin designated acidocin J1132 that has a narrow inhibitory spectrum. Maximum production of acidocin J1132 in MRS broth was detected at pH 5.0. Acidocin J1132 was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and sequential cation exchange and reversed-phase chromatographies. Acidocin J1132 activity was associated with two components, termed alpha and beta. On the basis of N-terminal amino acid sequencing and the molecular masses of the alpha and beta components, it is interpreted that the compounds differ by an additional glycine residue in the beta component. Both alpha and beta had inhibitory activity, and an increase in activity by the complementary action of the two components was observed. Acidocin J1132 is bactericidal and dissipates the membrane potential and the pH gradient in sensitive cells, which affect such proton motive force-dependent processes as amino acid transport. Acidocin J1132 also caused efflux of preaccumulated amino acid taken up via a unidirectional ATP-driven transport system. Secondary structure prediction revealed the presence of an amphiphilic alpha-helix region that could form hydrophilic pores. These results suggest that acidocin J1132 is a pore-forming bacteriocin that creates cell membrane channels through the "barrel-stave" mechanism.
TI  - [Liver abscess caused by Lactobacillus acidophilus].
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus is usually considered to be non pathogenic. We report a case of liver abscess due to Lactobacillus acidophilus in a 39 year-old man with chronic pancreatitis complicated by both endocrine and exocrine insufficiency, and with a choledoco-duodenostomy. Lactobacillus acidophilus was isolated in blood and liver samples. Complete recovery of the liver abscess occurred after antibiotherapy. We suggest that the abnormally low duodenal pH secondary to pancreatic insufficiency may have promoted both Lactobacillus acidophilus adhesion and multiplication in this patient. The choledoco-duodenostomy may then have promoted biliary tract colonisation.
TI  - Effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus supplementation of milk replacer on preweaning performance of calves.
AB  - Forty Holstein-Friesian calves were used to evaluate the effect on young calves of daily dietary supplementation with Lactobacillus acidophilus. Calves were randomly assigned at 2 d of age to one of two treatments; 1) milk replacer with no additives or 2) milk replacer supplemented with 1 ml (5 x 10(7)) of viable L. acidophilus bacteria at each of two feedings per day. Milk replacer was reconstituted to 12% DM and fed at 10% of BW/d for the duration of the 6-wk trial. A commercial starter pellet was offered for ad libitum intake from 7 d of age. Treatment had no effect on actual BW at any stage or on total BW gain; however, average daily gain during wk 2 was affected by L. acidophilus supplementation. Calves receiving L. acidophilus maintained initial BW, and the control calves lost BW until 2 wk of age, at an average rate of 112 g/d. Starter intake, total DMI, feed efficiency, and occurrence of diarrhea were unaffected by treatment. Therefore, L. acidophilus supplementation for calves fed milk replacer may be beneficial during the first 2 wk of life.
TI  - Growth kinetics of Lactobacillus acidophilus under ohmic heating.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus OSU133 was inoculated into MRS broth in a fermenter vessel and incubated at 30, 35, or 45 degrees C with agitation. Incubation temperatures were attained by conventional or ohmic heating. An electrical current at low (15 V) or high (40 V) voltage was used to heat the culture directly during fermentations under ohmic heating. The growth parameters (lag period, minimum generation time, and maximum growth) and changes in pH were determined during fermentation. Metabolic activities (consumption of glucose and production of lactic acid and bacteriocin) were determined during fermentation at 35 degrees C under both heating methods. Lag period for L. acidophilus was affected appreciably by the method of heating, but the magnitude of these changes depended on the fermentation temperature. When fermentation was done at 30 degrees C, lag period decreased by 94% under low-voltage ohmic, compared with conventional, heating methods. Ohmic heating did not change the generation time significantly and caused slight, but significant (p < 0.01) decrease in maximum growth. Therefore, the electric current enhances the early stages, but it inhibits the late stages of growth. Ohmic, compared with conventional, heating resulted in higher final pH and lower bacteriocin activity in the fermented medium. However, ohmic heating at 35 degrees C had minimal effect on glucose utilization and lactic acid production by L. acidophilus. Results show that measurement of the electric current when ohmic heating is done at a constant voltage may be used in monitoring such fermentations. In conclusion, ohmic heating is potentially useful in certain applications related to fermented foods. (c) 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
TI  - Characterization of Lactobacillus acidophilus strains for use as dietary adjunct.
AB  - Seven Lactobacillus acidophilus strains were studied for their morphology, biochemical properties, growth behaviour, bile tolerance, cholesterol uptake and survival at low pH. The strains significantly differed in their biochemical and beneficial traits. The strains which exhibited cholesterol uptake and ability to grow in the presence of 0.3% bile salt also utilized mannitol.
TI  - Viability of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei in fermented milk  products during refrigerated storage.
AB  - The viability was investigated of five strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus and one strain of Lactobacillus casei that were added as adjuncts to yogurt and cultured buttermilk during 28 d of refrigerated storage at 5 to 7 degrees C. A modification of LBS (Lactobacillus selection) agar was used for the enumeration of L. acidophilus and L. casei. The medium allowed the colony formation of the adjunct bacteria while preventing colony formation of the traditional yogurt or buttermilk starter cultures. At each sampling period, colonies from the selective agar medium were isolated for confirmation of identity to confirm that only L. acidophilus and L. casei were enumerated, that their characteristics did not change during storage, or both. The strains of L. acidophilus varied in both cultured products. In buttermilk, L. acidophilus MUH-41, O-16, and L-1 exhibited no significant loss in viability, but strains 43121 and La-5 did. No significant loss in viability of L. acidophilus MUH-41 and L-1 occurred in yogurt prepared using culture CM2; however, strains 43121, O-16, and La-5 lost viability. In the yogurt prepared using culture YC-4, L. acidophilus 43121 exhibited no significant loss in viability, but MUH-41, O-16, L-1, and La-5 did. There was no loss in viability of L. casei GG during storage of any of the cultured products.
TI  - The potential of Lactobacillus as a carrier for oral immunization: development and preliminary characterization of vector systems for targeted delivery of antigens.
AB  - Oral administration of lactobacilli evokes mucosal and systemic immune responses  against epitopes associated with these organisms (Gerritse et al., 1990, 1991). The adjuvant function of different Lactobacillus species was investigated under the conditions of intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection or oral administration. After i.p. injection of trinitrophenylated chicken gamma-globulin, high DTH responses were observed with Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus plantarum, but low responses with Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. In different experimental model systems L. casei and L. plantarum consistently showed significant adjuvanticity. A series of expression and expression-secretion vectors containing the strong constitutive promoter of the L. casei L-ldh gene or the regulatable promoter of the Lactobacillus amylovorus amy gene (Pouwels and Leer, 1995) was used for the intracellular, extracellular and surface-bound expression of an influenza virus antigenic determinant fused to Escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase. Intracellular expression of the fusion protein amounted to 1-2% of total soluble protein. Lactobacilli synthesizing the fusion protein intracellularly evoked an oral immune response after subcutaneous priming.

AB  
TI  - [The efficacy of the eubiotic bifacide when used in the combined antibacterial therapy of newborn infants with infectious-inflammatory diseases].
AB  - The efficacies of bifacid and bifidumbacterin were studied comparatively in the correction of intestinal biocenosis in 60 newborns with infectious inflammatory diseases and intestine disfunction treated with massive doses of antibacterial drugs. The study showed that the use of bifidumbacterin was accompanied by significant disturbances in the biocenosis and by development of the intestinal syndrome. The protective action of the drug was observed after a short-term use only of one antibiotic and when the course of the bifidum therapy was continued after discontinuation of the treatment with antibacterial drugs. The use of bifacid was accompanied by a rapid (by the 2nd or the 5th day fo the treatment) and stable normalization of the stools and a marked improvement of the patient general state. The clinical efficacy of bifacid was much higher than that of bifidumbacterin. At the background of the bifacid therapy there was observed correction of the intestinal microflora composition due to normalization of the count of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Colibacillus as well as to eradication of opportunistic pathogens.
TI  - The effect of sour milk as a postmilking teat dip for mastitis prevention in a dairy herd.
AB  - In a preliminary in vitro study, the growth of Staphylococcus aureus was totally  inhibited during incubation for 24 h at 35 degrees C-37 degrees C in a solution of cooked commercial milk with 1% of uncooked commercial sour milk ("A piima"). In a subsequent clinical trial, "A piima" sour milk with 5% glycerol was used as a postmilking teat dip from February to June. Quarterly milk samples were drawn once a month aseptically from 133 cows. Percentages of pathogen positive samples and somatic cell count (SCC) from teats dipped with the sour milk were compared with those dipped with a commercial iodine teat dip and those of undipped controls. During March-June there were fewer isolations of S. aureus (2.09%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (2.52%) in the sour-milk group than in the control group (3.09% and 4.07%, respectively). In iodine group, there were fewer isolations of S. aureus (0.83%) but more isolations of coagulase-negative staphylococci (5.26%) than in the control group. During the study period, the percentages of bacterial isolates did not differ statistically significantly between treatments, p = 0.291. The percentage of quarters with a SCC over 125,000 at the end of the study was one third lower in the sour-milk group than in the control group (16.67% and 26.23% respectively) but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.074). The results indicate that a sour-milk teat-dip preparation can inhibit new intra mammary infections (IMI).
TI  - Lactobacillus- and bifidobacterium-mediated antigenotoxicity in the colon of rats.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are proposed to have several beneficial effects, including the inactivation of carcinogens. We have studied the potential of Lactobacillus acidophilus (from a commercially available yogurt), Lactobacillus gasseri (P79), Lactobacillus confusus (DSM20196), Streptococcus thermophilus (NCIM 50083), Bifidobacterium breve and Bifidobacterium longum (from human infant stool) to prevent the induction of DNA damage by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG, 7.5 mg/kg body wt) in colon cells of the rat. Using the new technique of single cell microgel electrophoresis, all investigated strains were antigenotoxic toward MNNG after a single dose of 10(10) viable cells/kg body wt p.o. eight hours before the carcinogen. One-half and one-tenth of this initial dose resulted in a loss of protective activity. High doses of heat-treated L. acidophilus strains were also not antigenotoxic. One mechanism of the preventive effect could be that bacterial metabolites or components are responsible. Accordingly, selected examples were investigated in vitro in colon cells of the rat. Metabolically active L. acidophilus cells, as well as an acetone extract of the culture, prevented MNNG-induced DNA damage. Different cell fractions from L. acidophilus (cytoplasm, cell wall skeleton, cell wall) were devoid of antigenotoxic activity, whereas the peptidoglycan fraction and whole freeze-dried cells were antigenotoxic. As a second carcinogen, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) was used. A dose- and time-response study was first performed to assess the effects of DMH in several segments of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Exposure for 16 hours to 15 or 25 mg DMH/kg body wt p.o. induced DNA damage in cells of the distal colon of rats, whereas no cytotoxicity was seen. Pretreatment orally with LAB on four consecutive mornings before DMH gavage (8 hours after the last LAB application) revealed that L. acidophilus, L. confusus, L. gasseri, B. longum, and B. breve inhibited the genotoxic effect of DMH. One of four S. thermophilus and one of three Lactobacillus delbrueckeii ssp. bulgaricus strains were also protective. Heat-treated L. acidophilus did not inhibit DMH-induced genotoxicity. A few aliquots of the colon cells were processed immunohistochemically for the presence of the "proliferation cell nuclear antigen" (PCNA). DMH treatment did not increase PCNA, nor was there any modulation by LAB. The effect of L. acidophilus on foreign compound-metabolizing enzymes (Phase I and Phase II) in liver and colon cells of rats revealed only one parameter to be modulated, namely, a two- to three-fold increase in the levels of NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase. The meaning of this finding, in terms of possible chemoprevention by LAB, remains unclear. In conclusion, our studies show that most, but not all, LAB tested could strongly inhibit genotoxicity in the GI tract of the rat and that viable LAB organisms are required for the protective effect in vivo. The comet assay technique is a powerful tool to elucidate such in vivo antigenotoxic activities in tumor target tissues.
TI  - Inhibition of the accumulation of uremic toxins in the blood and their precursors in the feces after oral administration of Lebenin, a lactic acid bacteria preparation, to uremic patients undergoing hemodialysis.
AB  - The plasma levels of phenol, p-cresol, and indican are markedly increased in uremic patients, and cannot be efficiently reduced by hemodialysis. Such uremic toxins, which are produced in the intestine as bacterial putrefactive metabolites, accumulate to a great degree in the feces of hemodialysis patients. Oral administration of Lebenin, a preparation consisting of antibiotic-resistant lactic acid bacteria, reduced the levels of fecal putrefactive metabolites to levels comparable with those of healthy subjects. Moreover, the plasma level of indican also significantly decreased in these Lebenin-treated patients. An analysis of the fecal microflora revealed that a disturbed composition of the microflora characterized by an overgrowth of aerobic bacteria is restored to normal by oral administration of Lebenin in hemodialysis patients. These results thus demonstrate that oral administration of lactic acid bacteria in uremic patients is effective in reducing the levels of uremic toxins, especially that of indican, in the blood by inhibiting bacterial production by means of correcting the intestinal microflora.
TI  - Role of intestinal bacteria in ileal ulcer formation in rats treated with a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug.
AB  - The role of intestinal bacteria in induction and repression of ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with one of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 5-bromo-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl) thiophene (BFMeT), was examined in this study. BFMeT was administered by intragastric gavage once at doses of 500-1,500 mg/kg of body weight to Wistar rats treated with and without antibiotics (bacitracin, neomycin, streptomycin), germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats, and 72 hr later their gastrointestinal tracts were examined for ulcer formation. A single oral administration of BFMeT induced ileal ulcers in specific pathogen-free rats. However, the rats given antibiotics to reduce the intestinal bacteria had no ulcers. BFMeT-treated germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with Bifidobacterium adolescentis or Lactobacillus acidophilus also had no intestinal ulcers. However, the drug induced ileal ulcers in gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with Eubacterium limosum or Escherichia coli. An overnight culture of B. adolescentis or L. acidophilus or yogurt containing Bifidobacterium breve and Streptococcus thermophilus, when given as drinking water, inhibited ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with BFMeT. Gram staining of the ileal contents of normal rats revealed that 97.4% of the stained microorganisms were Gram-positive rods and only 1.2% were Gram-negative rods. In the group of rats with ulcers induced by BFMeT, the Gram-positive rods decreased by 56.4% and the Gram-negative rods including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Proteus and Bacteroides increased by 37.3%. However, in the group of rats administered the Bifidobacterium culture, the Lactobacillus culture or yogurt, the percentages of the Gram-negative rods were decreased. Although Lactobacillus was a major bacterium in the ileum of normal rats, the Gram-negative facultatively anaerobic rods E.coli, Klebsiella and Proteus were increased in the ulcerated ileum of rats treated with BFMeT, suggesting that these bacteria are associated with ulcer formation in rats treated with NSAIDs, and that Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium inhibit it by repressing the growth of ulcer-inducing bacteria.
TI  - Therapy of bacterial vaginosis using exogenously-applied Lactobacilli acidophili  and a low dose of estriol: a placebo-controlled multicentric clinical trial.
AB  - The efficacy of vaginal tablets (Gynoflor) containing 50 mg of a lyophilisate of  viable, H2O2-producing Lactobacillus acidophilus (at least 10(7) colony forming units/tablet) and 0.03 mg estriol (CAS 50-27-1) for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV) was tested in a multicentric, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial with parallel-group design. 32 non-menopausal women with positive diagnoses for BV, including intermediate cases, participated in the trial. Patients were diagnosed using the classical clinical parameters of BV according to Amsel and using microscopic analysis of the Gram-stained vaginal smear. A positive clinical diagnosis of BV required at least 2 of the following 4 clinical criteria to be positive; greyish-white, homogeneous leukorrhea; vaginal pH > 4.5; KOH test for volatile amines; presence of clue cells. Microscopic diagnosis of BV, on the other hand, was obtained if examination of the Gram-stained vaginal smear showed less than 6 lactobacilli per field of view (1000 x magnification). This corresponds to another definition of BV as "lactobacilli deficiency syndrome". The efficacy of the 6-day therapy with 1-2 vaginal tablets daily was evaluated using both clinical and microscopic analysis. Using Amsel's classical clinical parameters of BV, the cure rate (defined as < or = 1 of the 4 clinical criteria positive) two weeks after the start of therapy was 77% in the verum group and 25% in the placebo group. Four weeks after the start of therapy, the cure rate was 88% in the verum group and 22% in the placebo group. At both control examinations, the cure rate for the test group was significantly higher than that for the placebo group (p < 0.05, Fisher's exact test, 2-sided, significance level 0.05). In addition, the trial showed that after 6 days of treatment with the test preparation, the lactobacilli were capable of recolonising the vagina. A significant increase in the number of lactobacilli was observed in the Gram-stained vaginal smear for the patient group treated with the test preparation compared to the placebo patient group (p < 0.05, Fisher's exact test, 2-sided, significance level 0.05), two and four weeks after the start of the 6-day treatment.
TI  - Positive selection, cloning vectors for gram-positive bacteria based on a restriction endonuclease cassette.
AB  - Lactococcus lactis contains numerous restriction and modification (R/M) systems of different specificities. A novel IIS type R/M system encoded by the LlaI operon has previously been characterized from the L. lactis conjugative plasmid pTR2030. The LlaI operon is composed of six genes: First, a small regulatory gene llaIC precedes the methylase gene llaIM. The following three genes, llaI.1, llaI.2, llaI.3, are all essential for restriction endonuclease activity and are designed as the restriction cassette llaIR. The forth open reading frame of unknown function follows the llaIR gene cassette. We have successfully subcloned the three llaIR genes, llaI.1, llaI.2, and llaI.3, without llaIM, as a suicide cassette into the three shuttle vectors pTRKL2, pTRKH2, and pBV5030. A promoter (P6) from Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC4356, which is functional in E. coli, lactococci, and lactobacilli (Djordjevic and Topisirovic, unpublished) was cloned upstream of the three gene cassette. Restriction activity was evaluated in Escherichia coli and several gram-positive bacteria. The llaIR restriction cassette was not functional in E. coli, but its presence was lethal to L. lactis, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Carnobacterium pisicola, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and Leuconostoc gelidum. Several novel, positive selection cloning vectors were developed that can exploit unique cloning sites within the llaIR cassette. Insertions in llaI.1 resulted in complete inactivation of restriction activity and provided unconditional selection for recombinant plasmids in surviving transformants. These positive selection cloning vectors are the first for gram-positive bacteria that are based on a restriction endonuclease cassette. Functional activity of the llaIR genes in various gram-positive bacteria would also enable use of these cloning vectors for positive selection of promoters, terminators, and regulatory sequences across these genera.
TI  - Biomodulation of the toxic and nutritional effects of small bowel bacterial overgrowth in end-stage kidney disease using freeze-dried Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Small bowel bacterial overgrowth (SBBO), well known to occur in end-stage kidney  failure, is responsible for producing uremic toxins and contributing to the patient's decreased nutritional well-being. In this study, 8 hemodialysis patients were treated with a course of oral Lactobacillus acidophilus (LBA) in an attempt to alter this SBBO. LBA treatment was effective in lowering 2 compounds generated in vivo. Serum dimethylamine (DMA) levels dropped from 224 +/- 47 to 154 +/- 47 micrograms/dl at the end of LBA treatment (p < 0.001). Nitrosodimethylamine, a carcinogen, levels also decreased significantly from 178 +/- 67 (untreated) to 83 +/- 49 ng/kg (after LBA treatment). Patients nutritional status, assessed as serum albumin, body weight, caloric intake, midarm muscle area (MAMA) and appetite improved modestly, but not significantly. LBA changed small bowel pathobiology by modifying metabolic actions of SBBO, reducing in vivo generation of toxins and carcinogens and promoting nutrition with no adverse side effects.
TI  - Antagonism of lactic acid bacteria towards Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia  coli on agar plates and in milk.
AB  - The antagonistic effect of lactic acid bacteria (LAB, including Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. casei and Streptococcus thermophilus) on Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was evaluated on MRS agar with the deferred and cross-streaking techniques, and in milk with the plate counting method. All LAB were repressive to S aureus and E coli on the agar medium. However, their suppressive activity was significantly reduced when the agar medium was buffered to pH 7.2. In normal milk, L acidophilus strains A and B, S thermophilus and its combinations with L acidophilus A and L bulgaricus 6032 were inhibitory to S aureus, while in mastitic milk, only S thermophilus and its combinations showed inhibition. L acidophilus A and L bulgaricus 34104 were repressive to E coli growth in normal milk. S thermophilus and its combinations were inhibitory to E coli in both the normal and mastitic milk samples. These results indicate that the antagonistic activity of LAB on pathogenic bacteria varied with the type of media in which the tests were done, and that testing of in vitro antagonism in milk would be more informative than that in artificial media for in vivo tests concerning the possible roles of competitive microbiological ecology in mastitis control.
TI  - Effect of probiotic supplementation on serum/yolk cholesterol and on egg shell thickness in layers.
AB  - 1. The effect of probiotic supplementation on egg production, on serum and yolk cholesterol and on egg shell thickness in 24 White Leghorn layers was studied from 28-38 weeks of age. 2. In 3 treatments the diet was supplemented with 0, 100 and 150 mg probiotic/kg food. 3. In the 100 mg probiotic group, egg production improved by 5%, and shell thickness improved slightly, with fewer thin-shelled eggs than in the control (8.6% compared to 18.6%). 4. The initial serum cholesterol concentration of 170.2 mg/dl in control birds remained similar throughout the 10-week experimental period, whereas in the 150 mg group the initial value of 176.5 mg/dl decreased to 114.3 mg by week 10. 5. Yolk cholesterol concentration was 14.69 mg in the control group and 11.28 and 11.37 mg/g in the 100 and 150 mg probiotic groups respectively. Overall mean total egg cholesterol was thus reduced by probiotic supplementation.
TI  - Effect of administration of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria to newborn calves and piglets.
AB  - The effect of oral administration of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria on newborn livestock was investigated. Oral administration of Bifidobacterium pseudolongum or Lactobacillus acidophilus to calves improved BW gain and feed conversion over that of untreated controls. The frequency of diarrhea occurrence was decreased in the group fed probiotics. However, there was no significant difference between calves administered B. pseudolongum and those administered L. acidophilus. Under conditions of feeding without antibiotics, the frequency of diarrhea was decreased markedly by administration of probiotics. The BW gain of piglets was significantly greater during both the suckling and weaning periods for the group fed probiotics than for the control group. The effect was more evident during the suckling period than during the weaning period. Under conditions of feeding without antibiotics, the frequency of piglet mortality was decreased markedly by administration of probiotics. The probiotics tested here had useful effects, including improved BW gain, feed conversion, and fecal condition of both newborn calves and piglets.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide sequence of the gene for acidocin 8912, a bacteriocin from Lactobacillus acidophilus TK8912.
AB  - Acidocin 8912 is a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus TK8912. The  acidocin 8912 structural gene, acdT, was cloned and determined. It was located on the 14-kb plasmid pL103 and encoded a 46 amino acid precursor including a 20 amino acid N-terminal extension. The precursor sequence of the acdT gene shows a conservation of the general structural characteristics of the bacteriocin precursors from some lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Development of RAPD protocol for typing of strains of lactic acid bacteria and enterococci.
AB  - A protocol for typing strains of lactic acid bacteria and enterococci based on randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fragments has been developed. Using a single 10-mer primer, fingerprints were achieved without the need to isolate genomic DNA. Different conditions of DNA release and amplification were investigated in order to obtain reproducible results and high discrimination among strains. This RAPD protocol was successfully applied for the typing of strains belonging to the species Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. helveticus, Lact. casei, Lact. reuteri, Lact. plantarum, Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. faecium and Streptococcus thermophilus.
TI  - Identification, cloning, and nucleotide sequence of a silent S-layer protein gene of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 which has extensive similarity with the S-layer protein gene of this species.
AB  - The bacterial S-layer forms a regular structure, composed of a monolayer of one (glyco)protein, on the surfaces of many prokaryotic species. S-layers are reported to fulfil different functions, such as attachment structures for extracellular enzymes and major virulence determinants for pathogenic species. Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356, which originates from the human pharynx, possesses such an S-layer. No function has yet been assigned to the S-layer of this species. Besides the structural gene (slpA) for the S-layer protein (S-protein) which constitutes this S-layer, we have identified a silent gene (slpB), which is almost identical to slpA in two regions. From the deduced amino acid sequence, it appears that the mature SB-protein (44,884 Da) is 53% similar to the SA-protein (43,636 Da) in the N-terminal and middle parts of the proteins. The C-terminal parts of the two proteins are identical except for one amino acid residue. The physical properties of the deduced S-proteins are virtually the same. Northern (RNA) blot analysis shows that only the slpA gene is expressed in wild-type cells, in line with the results from sequencing and primer extension analyses, which reveal that only the slpA gene harbors a promoter, which is located immediately upstream of the region where the two genes are identical. The occurrence of in vivo chromosomal recombination between the two S-protein-encoding genes will be described elsewhere.
TI  - Role of Escherichia coli P fimbriae in intestinal colonization in gnotobiotic rats.
AB  - Adherence via P fimbriae is associated with long-term persistence of Escherichia  coli in the human large intestine, but a causal relationship has not been proven. In the present study, germfree rats were colonized with a mixture of two isogenic E. coli strains, one P fimbriated and the other type 1 fimbriated. Both types of fimbriae conferred adherence to rat colonic epithelial cells. With two mutant strains from a pyelonephritogenic isolate of serotype O75:K5:H-, the P-fimbriated strain 824 attained much higher numbers than its type 1-fimbriated counterpart when colonized in vivo for 2 weeks (10(10) versus 10(6) bacteria per g, respectively; P < 0.0001). The expression of P fimbriae by 824 was also retained during colonization. With transformant isogenic strains obtained from a normal fecal isolate incapable of phase variation, no benefit of P fimbriae was seen and most bacteria lost their plasmids during in vivo colonization. When the pyelonephritogenic mutant and fecal transformant strains were combined, the former colonized at high levels while the latter were suppressed. In contrast, no suppression was seen when the transformant E. coli strains colonized in combination with Lactobacillus acidophilus or Peptostreptococcus sp. The results indicate that P fimbriae, but also other bacterial traits linked to uropathogeneicity, could play an important role for persistence in the gut normal microbiota. Neither P nor type 1 fimbriae seemed to contribute to the ability to translocate to the mesenteric lymph nodes.
TI  - Effect of Candida albicans infection and clotrimazole treatment on vaginal microflora in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of Candida albicans infection and clotrimazole treatment on vaginal microflora. METHODS: Studies were conducted using a model simulating the healthy vaginal ecosystem. The model consisted of a mixed culture of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Prevotella bivia, and group D Streptococcus sp grown in continuous culture in a chemically defined medium. The status of the model was assessed using a mathematical equation that determines the probability a microflora is normal or abnormal. RESULTS: Challenge of the model with C albicans was followed within 24 hours by the development of microbial populations representing an abnormal microflora. Treatment of the system with clotrimazole (100 micrograms/mL) resulted in a decrease in C albicans counts to 0 within 48 hours. However, treatment also altered other components of the vaginal microflora, which did not return to normal. Addition of clotrimazole (100 micrograms/mL) to the system in the absence of C albicans also resulted in an abnormal model by 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Candida albicans infection of the vaginal ecosystem, as represented by this in vitro model, has a deleterious effect on members of the normal microflora. Clotrimazole, although effective against C albicans infection, also has a deleterious effect on components of the normal vaginal microflora. One of the implications for women using clotrimazole for microbiologically undocumented vaginal yeast infections is an increased risk of infection or disease through the disruption of the protective microflora barrier.
TI  - Lactobacilli to prevent traveler's diarrhea?
AB  
TI  - Survival during frozen and subsequent refrigerated storage of Lactobacillus acidophilus cells as influenced by the growth phase.
AB  - Cells of Lactobacillus acidophilus propagated in peptonized milk nutrient broth maintained at pH 5 were harvested during the late logarithmic (log) phase and at 6 h into the stationary phase of growth. Concentrated cultures were prepared from each age of cells, frozen, and stored at -196 degrees C. The concentrated cultures were assayed for numbers of total and bile-tolerant lactobacilli, beta-galactosidase activity, and ability to assimilate cholesterol before and after storage at -196 degrees C. Nonfermented acidophilus milk, prepared following 28 d of storage at -196 degrees C from each concentrated culture, was tested before and after 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 d of storage at 7 degrees C. No decrease in numbers of total or bile-tolerant lactobacilli, beta-galactosidase activity, or amount of cholesterol assimilated was observed for any of three strains studied during storage at -196 degrees C. There were no significant differences between the two harvest times during storage at this temperature for any of the three strains. However, when the cells were suspended in milk and stored at 7 degrees C, the numbers of total and bile-tolerant lactobacilli declined over time as did the beta-galactosidase activity and the ability to assimilate cholesterol. The cells from L. acidophilus 223, harvested 6 h into the stationary phase, exhibited significantly less decrease in total numbers during extended storage at 7 degrees C than did the cells harvested in the late logarithmic phase. There was little or no difference in the decline in numbers of total lactobacilli between the two harvest times for strains 606 and 107. All strains decreased significantly in beta-galactosidase activity and the ability to assimilate cholesterol during storage in milk at 7 degrees C with no significant differences between the two harvest times.
TI  - Comparison of proteolytic activities in various lactobacilli.
AB  - A total of 169 Lactobacillus strains from 12 species (Lb. acidophilus, Lb. brevis, Lb. buchneri, Lb. casei, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, Lb. fermentum, Lb. helveticus, Lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei, Lb. plantarum and Lb. rhamnosus), isolated from raw milk and various milk products, and 9 Lactococcus lactis strains were evaluated for peptidase activities with five chromogenic substrates and a tryptic digest of casein. Within each species, the peptidase activity of the cell-free extracts of the strains varied. Furthermore, differences were observed between the Lactobacillus species and Lc. lactis. Lb. helveticus had by far the highest hydrolysing activities towards all substrates, indicating the presence of powerful aminopeptidases, X-prolyl-dipeptidyl aminopeptidases and proline iminopeptidases. Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus possessed high hydrolysing activities towards substrates containing proline, alanyl-prolyl-p-nitroanilide and prolyl-p-nitroanilide. On the other hand, Lb. fermentum and Lb. brevis could be considered as weakly proteolytic species. A more detailed study with highly proteolytic Lactobacillus strains indicated that at least three different proteinases or endopeptidases were present. Compared with Lc. lactis, the Lactobacillus strains had a much lower hydrolytic action on glutamyl-glutamic acid, suggesting that glutamyl aminopeptidase was absent in lactobacilli.
TI  - Identification of the replication region of Lactobacillus acidophilus plasmid pLA103.
AB  - The structure of the region necessary for replication of the plasmid pLA103 from  Lactobacillus acidophilus TK8912 has been characterized. Sequence analysis revealed that the replication region contained an open reading frame (OrfA) encoding a 282-amino acid peptide preceded by a 22-bp tandem repeat sequence region. The predicted OrfA protein showed homology to the replication protein of a plasmid from Pediococcus halophilus. The plasmid containing the repeat sequence region preceding OrfA was able to replicate in the Lactobacillus host when provided with OrfA in trans, suggesting that the repeat sequence region contains the origin sequence essential for the pLA103 replication.
TI  - Genetic and biochemical characterization of the Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp.  lactis bacteriophage LL-H lysin.
AB  - LL-H, a virulent phage of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, produces a peptidoglycan-degrading enzyme, Mur, that is effective on L. delbrueckii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, and Pediococcus damnosus cell walls. In this study, the LL-H gene mur was cloned into Escherichia coli, its nucleotide sequence was determined, and the enzyme produced in E. coli was purified and biochemically characterized. Mur was purified 112-fold by means of ammonium sulfate precipitation and cation-exchange chromatography. The cell wall-hydrolyzing activity was found to be associated with a 34-kDa protein. The C-terminal domain of Mur is not essential for catalytic activity since it can be removed without destroying the lytic activity. The N-terminal sequence of the purified lysin was identical to that deduced from the nucleotide sequence, but the first methionine is absent from the mature protein. The N-terminal part of this 297-amino-acid protein had homology with several Chalaropsis-type lysozymes. Reduction of purified and Mur-digested L. delbrueckii cell wall material with labeled NaB3H4 indicated that the enzyme is a muramidase. The temperature optimum of purified Mur is between 30 and 40 degrees C, and the pH optimum is around 5.0. The LL-H lysin Mur is stable at temperatures below 60 degrees C.
TI  - In vitro inhibition of Helicobacter pylori NCTC 11637 by organic acids and lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - In this study the effects of both pH and organic acids on Helicobacter pylori NCTC 11637 were tested. Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. casei, Lact. bulgaricus, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Bifidobacterium bifidus were assayed for their lactic acid production, pH and inhibition of H. pylori growth. A standard antimicrobial plate well diffusion assay was employed to examine inhibitory effects. Lactic, acetic and hydrochloric acids demonstrated inhibition of H. pylori growth in a concentration-dependent manner with the lactic acid demonstrating the greatest inhibition. This inhibition was due both to the pH of the solution and its concentration. Six strains of Lact. acidophilus and one strain of Lact. casei subsp. rhamnosus inhibited H. pylori growth where as Bifidobacterium bifidus, Ped. pentosaceus and Lact. bulgaricus did not. Concentrations of lactic acid produced by these strains ranged from 50 to 156 mmol l-1 and correlated with H. pylori inhibition. The role of probiotic organisms and their metabolic by-products in the eradication of H. pylori in vivo remains to be determined.
TI  - Influence of lactobacilli on the adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans to fibers and epithelial cells.
AB  - The ability of organisms to adhere to and form biofilms on fibrous materials is believed to be an important initiating step in the induction of several diseases, such as toxic shock syndrome. Using an in vitro assay, a moderately hydrophobic strain of Staphylococcus aureus (water contact angle 35 degrees) and a hydrophilic Candida albicans (shown by a hexadecane test) were highly adherent to commercial diaper fibers. The lumen side of the diaper was porous and the fibers were very hydrophobic (> 140 degrees), but the internal section was very hydrophilic (0 degrees), presumably for lus strains was present. Surfaces precoated with lactobacilli inhibited staphylococcal adhesion by 26-97%, and candida by 0-67%. When the lactobacilli were used to challenge adherent pathogens, there was 99% displacement of the S. aureus and up to 91% displacement of C. albicans. Hydrophobic L. acidophilus 76 (54 degrees) and T-13 (80 degrees) were the most effective of five Lactobacillus isolates tested at interference by precoating. The moderately hydrophilic L. casei var rhamnosus GR-1 (33 degrees) was the most effective at displacing the yeast. Experiments with uroepithelial cells also showed that the lactobacilli could significantly interfere with the adhesion of both pathogens to the cells. The results demonstrate the rapidity with which two pathogens adhered to fibers and epithelial cells, and raised the possibility that members of the normal female urogenital flora might interfere with infections caused by these organisms.
TI  - Inhibition of food-borne pathogenic bacteria by bacteriocins from Lactobacillus gasseri.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus group and a Lact. reuteri isolated from human faeces were examined for production of antimicrobial agents against 16 strains of six species of food-borne enteric pathogenic bacteria. Several strains of Lact. gasseri showed wide inhibitory activity against the tested bacteria. Gassericin A produced by Lact. gasseri LA39 was one of the most widely active bacteriocins. It was bactericidal without causing cell lysis.
TI  - In vitro colonization ability of human colon mucosa by exogenous Lactobacillus strains.
AB  - We have tested five Lactobacillus strains for their in vitro colonization ability in a human colon epithelium culture model. Positive colonization occurred in different degrees in the presence of four Lactobacillus strains. We have found that L. casei GG and L. acidophilus NCFB 1748 induce an intermediate colonization. These two strains, largely investigated by others, have been reported to be beneficial to humans. The use of human intestinal tissue in our study partially reconstitutes the complex architectural specificity of human epithelium with the mucus layer and more closely simulates the in vivo situation.
TI  - In vitro fructooligosaccharide utilization and inhibition of Salmonella spp. by selected bacteria.
AB  - In vitro experiments were conducted to determine: 1) inhibitory capacities of potential direct-fed microbial bacteria against Salmonella serotypes; and 2) the ability of Bifidobacterium bifidum, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus casei, Lactococcus lactis, Pediococcus sp., and Salmonella spp. to grow in media containing fructooligosaccharides (FOS-50 or FOS pure formulation) as the only carbohydrate source. Thirteen bacteria (two strains of Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus subtilis, B. bifidum, E. faecium, two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. casei, Pediococcus sp., Propionibacterium acidopropionici, P. jensenii, and Propionibacterium sp.) were tested for inhibition of six Salmonella serotypes (S. california, S. enteritidis, S. heidelberg, S. mission, S. senftenberg, and S. typhimurium) using a spot-the-lawn technique. Bifidobacterium bifidum, E. faecium, all lactobacilli, and Pediococcus sp. clearly inhibited growth of all Salmonella serotypes. In the growth experiments, E. faecium, L. lactis, and Pediococcus sp. grew in media with either FOS-50 or the pure formulation of FOS as the sole carbohydrate source. All tested Salmonella serotypes utilized FOS-50 for growth; however growth varied among the serotypes. In contrast, none of the Salmonella serotypes grew in media containing the pure formulation of FOS as the only carbohydrate source.
TI  - Effect of milks inoculated with Lactobacillus acidophilus or a yogurt starter culture in lactose-maldigesting children.
AB  - Dairy products containing live bacteria that possess lactase activity are used for dietary management of lactose maldigestion. The efficacy of acidophilus milk and the effect of consuming unfermented milk that had been inoculated with yogurt bacteria have not been examined in children. We compared scores for breath H2 excretion and symptoms of 20 lactose-maldigesting children following ingestion of 250 ml of uninoculated milk with two identical milks inoculated with 10(10) cells of Lactobacillus acidophilus or with a commercial yogurt starter culture containing 10(8) cells of Lactobacillus lactis and 10(10) cells of Streptococcus thermophilus. Nine of 10 subjects who were symptomatic following ingestion of uninoculated milk experienced a reduction in symptoms following ingestion of milk inoculated with L. acidophilus, without a decline in H2 excretion. Five of 6 subjects who were symptomatic following uninoculated milk had decreased symptoms and a significant reduction in H2 excretion following milk inoculated with the yogurt culture. For lactose-maldigesting children, milks inoculated with L. acidophilus or with a yogurt culture were associated with decreased symptoms compared with those with uninoculated milk.
TI  - Effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus on antibiotic-associated gastrointestinal morbidity: a prospective randomized trial.
AB  - Oral antibiotic therapy can alter the gastrointestinal microflora and result in troublesome gastrointestinal complaints. Patients who have experience with broad-spectrum antibiotics may be reluctant to start or to comply with antibiotic therapy due to the associated discomfort. In the field of otolaryngology, oral antibiotic therapy is commonplace, and patient intolerance of a particular antibiotic may result in compromise to a less effective choice. Yogurt, which contains Lactobacillus acidophilus, is often recommended by practitioners to help reduce the side effects of oral antibiotic therapy. We wanted to objectively evaluate the effect of orally administered L. acidophilus on the gastrointestinal side effects of oral broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. Twenty-seven outpatients, 10 years of age or older, with ear, sinus, or throat infections, in whom amoxicillin/clavulanate was felt to be the antibiotic of choice, were randomly assigned to amoxicillin/clavulanate only, or amoxicillin/clavulanate and Lactobacillus treatment groups. Each patient was advised by the nursing staff to consume a well-balanced diet, and a detailed explanation of the medication schedule was given. A questionnaire was given to each patient at the conclusion of therapy. The data were analyzed using Spearman's rank-order correlations. Concomitant therapy of L. acidophilus with amoxicillin/clavulanate was associated with a significant decrease in patient complaints of gastrointestinal side effects and yeast superinfection. Almost all patients (89%) reported resolution of infection during the course of therapy. We believe that use of L. acidophilus is warranted in patients on broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with gastrointestinal complaints.
TI  - Antibiotic sensitivity pattern of various Lactobacillus acidophilus strains.
AB  - Seven L. acidophilus strains were examined for their antibiotic sensitivity against various chemotherapeutic agents and all of them were found to be sensitive to novobicin, chloramphenicol, ampicillin, erythromycin, oxytetracycline and chlorotetracycline, whereas, all were resistant to norfloxacin and nalidixic acid. The sensitivity towards remaining antibiotics varied among the strains. The results show that cultures should be tested for their sensitivity towards commonly used chemotherapeutic agents to eliminate starter failure during manufacture of cultured milk products.
TI  - Evaluation of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR as a method to differentiate Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus amylovorus, Lactobacillus gallinarum, Lactobacillus gasseri, and Lactobacillus johnsonii.
AB  - The technique random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR was evaluated as a method to differentiate Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus amylovorus, Lactobacillus gallinarum, Lactobacillus gasseri, and Lactobacillus johnsonii. Representative strains, including the type of each species, were selected from different clusters obtained by numerical analysis of total soluble cell protein patterns. Results obtained by RAPD-PCR corresponded well with results obtained by numerical analysis of total soluble cell protein patterns. The type strains of each species displayed different RAPD profiles. Strains with identical L(+)- nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent lactic dehydrogenase (nLDH) electrophoretic profiles could be distinguished on the basis of their RAPD profiles.
TI  - Development of intestinal lactobacilli in normal piglets.
AB  - The development of intestinal Lactobacillus spp. in 18 normal piglets from six litters was investigated from 1 to 45 d after birth. Faecal Lactobacillus strains isolated from piglets and their dams were identified at species and biovar levels on the basis of carbohydrate fermentation. A definite pattern was observed in the changes of four species and 20 biovars of lactobacilli appearing in faeces, with growth of the piglets. Lactobacillus reuteri colonized the animals on the first day of birth. The Lact. acidophilus group appeared 1 week after birth and maintained high levels in the intestine. Biovars B, C and E of Lact. reuteri were recovered as major biovars on the first to fourteenth days after birth. In the third and fourth weeks after birth, however, biovars F and G of Lact. reuteri were mainly recovered from piglet faeces. By the seventh week, biovars B, C and E predominated again in the intestine. No change in the composition of species and biovars of the genus Lactobacillus in the dams was detected.
TI  - A Collagen-Binding S-Layer Protein in Lactobacillus crispatus.
AB  - Two S-layer-expressing strains, Lactobacillus crispatus JCM 5810 and Lactobacillus acidophilus JCM 1132, were assessed for adherence to proteins of the mammalian extracellular matrix. L. crispatus JCM 5810 adhered efficiently to immobilized type IV and I collagens, laminin, and, with a lower affinity, to type V collagen and fibronectin. Strain JCM 1132 did not exhibit detectable adhesiveness. Within the fibronectin molecule, JCM 5810 recognized the 120-kDa cell-binding fragment of the protein, while no bacterial adhesion to the amino-terminal 30-kDa or the gelatin-binding 40-kDa fragment was detected. JCM 5810 but not JCM 1132 also bound (sup125)I-labelled soluble type IV collagen, and this binding was efficiently inhibited by unlabelled type IV and I collagens and less efficiently by type V collagen, but not by laminin or fibronectin. L. crispatus JCM 5810 but not L. acidophilus JCM 1132 also adhered to Matrigel, a reconstituted basement membrane preparation from mouse sarcoma cells, as well as to the extracellular matrix prepared from human Intestine 407 cells. S-layers from both strains were extracted with 2 M guanidine hydrochloride, separated by electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose sheets. The S-layer protein from JCM 5810 bound (sup125)I-labelled type IV collagen, whereas no binding was seen with the S-layer protein from JCM 1132. Binding of (sup125)I-collagen IV to the JCM 5810 S-layer protein was effectively inhibited by unlabelled type I and IV collagens but not by type V collagen, laminin, or fibronectin. It was concluded that L. crispatus JCM 5810 has the capacity to adhere to human subintestinal extracellular matrix via a collagen-binding S-layer.
TI  - [Intestinal microflora and antibiotic therapy].
AB  - Antibiotic therapy is one of the major factors leading to disturbances in the intestinal flora. This can lead to chronic diarrhea and life threatening pseudomembranous colitis. Much attention had recently been focused on so-called translocation of endotoxins and bacteria through the intestinal wall which lead to systemic infection, shock and multiorgan failure. Prevention is based on the proper choice of antibiotic and administration of lactic-acid bacteria.
TI  - Enhancement of lysozyme trypsin-mediated decay of intestinal bifidobacteria and lactobacilli.
AB  - Lysozyme-mediated lysis of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli was studied in in vitro tests using the agar gel plate and turbidometric Micrococcus luteus (lysodeikticus) procedure as a standard. Suspensions of the strains Bifidobacterium infantis, B. infantis liberorum, B. breve, B. longum, B. ssp, and Lactobacillus acidophilus proved to be resistant to egg white lysozyme and human milk lysozyme when incubated at 37 degrees C in concentrations of 5, 50, and 500 mg lysozyme/L, respectively, through 30 and 60 min. Heat treatment at 100 degrees C for 1 h and pretreatment with ether, acetone, ascorbic acid, and hydrogen peroxide failed to incline the bacteria to the lytic effects of lysozyme. Consecutive incubation of the lysozyme-pretreated bacteria with trypsin resulted in a significantly enhanced bacteriolysis in all strains of bacteria, with the exception of B. longum. The mode of action of lysozyme and proteolytic enzymes on Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli offers an explanation for the release of microbial building blocks and their colonic absorption and retention in the breast-fed baby.
TI  - Effect of lactose and Lactobacillus acidophilus on the colonization of Salmonella enteritidis in chicks concurrently infected with Eimeria tenella.
AB  - The effect of dietary lactose and Lactobacillus acidophilus on the colonization of Salmonella enteritidis (phage type 4) in newly hatched leghorn chicks concurrently infected with Eimeria tenella was studied. There were six groups of birds in each of two replicate trials: uninfected controls, birds infected with S. enteritidis, birds infected with S. enteritidis and E. tenella, birds infected with S. enteritidis and E. tenella that were fed with dietary lactose (5%), birds infected with S. enteritidis and E. tenella that were provided with L. acidophilus, and birds infected with S. enteritidis and E. tenella that were fed both L. acidophilus and dietary lactose (5%). Chickens were necropsied at 2, 5, and 8 days after S. enteritidis inoculation for bacteriological examination. The cecal population of S. enteritidis was significantly increased by infection with E. tenella. Lactose alone and the combination of lactose and L. acidophilus significantly reduced the population of S. enteritidis in the ceca of birds infected with E. tenella (P < 0.05), but the combination was more effective than lactose alone (P < 0.05). Adding anaerobic culture of L. acidophilus alone did not significantly decrease the population of S. enteritidis in the ceca. No significant reduction of colonization of S. enteritidis in the liver and spleen of birds with coccidiosis was observed.
TI  - Genetic analysis of acidocin B, a novel bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - The genes encoding the production of acidocin B, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus strain M46 which is active against Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium sporogenes, Brochothrix thermosphacta, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, but inactive against most other Lactobacillus species, were previously localized on a 4 kb XbaI-HindIII fragment of plasmid pCV461. In the present work, DNA sequence analysis revealed the presence of three consecutive ORFs, which potentially code for hydrophobic peptides composed of 60, 91 and 114 amino acids, respectively, and a fourth ORF of opposite polarity which could potentially encode a peptide of 59 amino acids. The middle ORF (ORF-2; acdB) was identified as the gene encoding acidocin B by comparing the amino acid composition of highly purified acidocin B with the deduced amino acid sequence of ORF-2. Our results suggest that acidocin B is synthesized as a precursor which is processed at a site which conforms to the ' -3, -1' rules of von Heijne to yield active acidocin B (59 amino acids). The presence of an immunity-protein-encoding gene on the 4 kb XbaI-BamHI fragment was deduced from the capacity of a plasmid vector harbouring this fragment to confer immunity upon transformation of L. fermentum NCK127. One of the three non-assigned ORFs may encode this immunity protein.
TI  - Effects of three microbial probiotics on postprandial porto-arterial concentration differences of glucose, galactose and amino-nitrogen in the young pig.
AB  - Postprandial kinetics of porto-arterial concentration differences of glucose (G), galactose (Gal), L-lactic acid (LA) and amino-N (AN) were studied in the piglet after the ingestion of 10(7) colony-forming units (cfu) Sporolactobacillus P44 (SP), or 10(6) cfu Bacillus cereus IP5832 (AC), or 10(6) cfu of a combination of Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. fermentum and L. brevis (AB)/g feed. Sixteen fistulated piglets (portal vein and brachiocephalic trunk; mean body weight 22 (SD 2) kg) were used. The diet was based on skimmed milk (320 g/kg), barley (300 g/kg), wheat bran (110 g/kg), maize (100 g/kg) and lactose (70 g/kg). The postprandial blood kinetics, four measurements per animal at 1-week intervals, were studied for 6 h after the ingestion of test meals of 400 g basal diet (BD) or this diet supplemented with the bacteria (SP, AC and AB respectively). Areas of porto-arterial concentration differences (APACD) of G, Gal and LA were not influenced by the bacteria supplements. APACD of AN was significantly higher after the ingestion of the SP diet than that estimated for BD.
TI  - Inability of Lactobacillus casei strain GG, L. acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium bifidum to degrade intestinal mucus glycoproteins.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactic acid bacteria have been suggested for use in the prevention of relapse of ulcerative colitis and of recurrent pouchitis. These strains may not damage the protective intestinal mucus glycoproteins. METHODS: Lactobacillus casei strain GG and strains isolated from a commercial fermented product (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and a mesophylic lactic culture) were cultured in vitro on hog gastric mucin and human intestinal glycoproteins. Furthermore, germ-free rats were mono-associated with Lactobacillus GG and poly-associated with the other strains. Glycoproteins were isolated from rat distal ileum, cecum, and colon. Mucus degradation was established by assaying carbohydrates (hexosamines, hexoses, pentoses), proteins, and blood group antigenicity. RESULTS: All strains colonized the intestinal mucus but were not found in the deep crypts. Degradation of mucus glycoproteins was observed neither in vitro nor in vivo. CONCLUSION: The tested strains do not break down intestinal mucus glycoproteins and thus far are safe to use for therapy.
TI  - Antibiotic-induced D-lactic acidosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of oral antibiotic-induced D-lactic acidosis in a patient with enteric overgrowth of Lactobacillus acidophilus. DESIGN: Single case study. SETTING: University-affiliated community hospital. INTERVENTION: Oral carbohydrate challenge test with 4000 kcal/d. MAIN RESULTS: A patient had several episodes of D-lactic acidosis after receiving oral antibiotics. Stool cultures yielded Lactobacillus acidophilus resistant to the implicated agents. Provocative challenge with dietary carbohydrate alone, in the absence of antibiotics, failed to reproduce the syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Oral antibiotics may induce D-lactic acidosis in patients with the short-bowel syndrome by promoting the overgrowth of resistant D-lactate-producing organisms. Interactions between carbohydrate intake and antibiotic use are likely determinants in the development of this syndrome. Periodic use of stool cultures with antimicrobial susceptibility testing may assist in the management of these patients by optimizing the selection of antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Microbiology of siljo, a traditional Ethiopian fermented legume product.
AB  - Siljo was prepared by thoroughly cooking powdered horsebean (Vicia faba) in safflower (Carthamus tinctorius) extract into a semi-solid slurry and then adding to it untreated black mustard (Brassica nigra) powder after cooling to 50 degrees C. The black mustard powder was the source of starter microorganisms, with Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. plantarum and L. delbruekii initiating and later dominating the fermentation process. The pH of the fermenting mass dropped to 4.5 within 36 h and reached 4.0 at 168 h. Aerobic mesophilic bacteria and lactic acid bacteria were each present at about 1x10(10) c.f.u./ml after 36 h of fermentation but Enterobacteriaceae were never detected. The dominant aerobic mesophilic flora consisted of Micrococcus, Bacillus and Lactobacillus spp. Crude protein, crude fat and ash increased slightly during the fermentation, with final values of around 28%, 25% and 7%, respectively, but there was a marked increase in protein availability and concentration during the fermentation.
TI  - The lysins of bacteriophages infecting lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - This short review highlights the complete absence of literature on lysins of bacteriophages infecting species like S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus, Pediococcus and Leuconostoc species, L. helveticus, L. acidophilus, L. plantarum and L. brevis, which are also widely used in the dairy industry. The lysins described share some similar biochemical characteristics: optimal pH and temperature, site of hydrolysis inside the peptidoglycan, and some activators and inhibitors. The cloning of the genes encoding these lysins only began in the last few years and four of them have been completely sequenced. In the future, these lysin genes could be interestingly compared to the host autolysin(s) gene(s). By contrast, the passage of phage lysins through the cytoplasmic membrane of the host cell in order to reach the peptidoglycan (via a signal sequence or the presence of a holin) seems not to be clearly resolved. The presence of a second open-reading frame upstream from the gene of the lysin, enabling a putative holin to be encoded, has already been suggested. No doubt our ever increasing knowledge about bacteriophage genome organization will help to elucidate this question. Meanwhile the obtention of a Lactococcus strain with an autolytic phenotype, using a bacteriophage lysin gene, as well as the successful use of purified PL1 lysin to obtain protoplasts of L. casei encourage us to continue to explore the field of bacteriophage lysins.
TI  - Influence of the incubation temperature on the autolytic activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - The effect of temperature and growth phase on the autolysis of Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 640 was studied. The maximal rate of autolytic activity (ca 48% cell lysis) was found at 45 degrees C. At this temperature, two peaks were detected: the first one at the early exponential phase of growth and the second lysis peak during the transition stage from the exponential to the stationary phase. The release of intracellular compounds absorbing at 260 and 280 nm was also detected at 45 degrees C. The microscopic observations revealed morphological changes and the presence of ghost cells. At 37 degrees C, the low autolytic activity obtained would be related to the normal cell cycle of growth.
TI  - Bacterial translocation and intestinal capillary permeability following major liver resection in the rat.
AB  - Bacterial infections constitute a major cause of morbidity and mortality after major liver resection and mechanisms of this type of complication have been poorly understood. The present study evaluated the translocation of enteric bacteria to mesenteric lymph nodes, viscera, and the systemic circulation and gut capillary permeability of a fine ultrastructural tracer in rats subjected to sham hepatectomy or 70% hepatectomy. Furthermore, the preventive effects of water-soluble ethylhydroxyethyl cellulose (EHEC) were studied. Cultures of all samples from rats subjected to sham hepatectomy or 70% hepatectomy with preoperative intravenous administration of EHEC were bacteriologically negative. The incidence of bacterial translocation from the gut to the systemic circulation and mesenteric lymph nodes was 30 and 80%, respectively (P < 0.01), and to the liver and kidneys 50 and 40%, respectively (P < 0.05), 12 hr after 70% hepatectomy. Intestinal capillary permeability and endothelial cell membrane permeability increased with the development of bacterial translocation. Translocating bacteria appeared within the cytoplasm of capillary endothelial cells. EHEC restored the changes in gut capillary permeability induced by major liver resection. These results indicate that gut capillary permeability may play an important role in maintaining the integrity of the gut barrier function and that increased permeability may be associated with the development of gut barrier failure.

AB  
TI  - Directed mutagenesis of deoxyguanosine site at arginine 79 up-regulates turnover  on deoxyadenosine kinase subunit of heterodimeric enzyme from Lactobacillus acidophilus R26.
AB  - Examination of conserved motifs on the cloned subunits of the deoxyguanosine kinase/deoxyadenosine kinase (dGK/dAK) of Lactobacillus acidophilus R-26 has begun with the Asp-Arg-Ser (DRS) motif. Replacement of Asp-78 of both subunits with Glu, Ala, or Asn reduced dGK and dAK activities to less than 0.2%, whereas replacement of Arg-79 with Lys, either on both subunits in tandem (R79K), or on the dGK subunit only (R79K:dGK), yielded active but kinetically modified enzymes. These were partially purified, and their kinetic and regulatory properties were analyzed. For dAK activity, the Vmax of the R79K:dGK enzyme was increased 28-fold, with no change in the limiting Km for dAdo, but with a slightly reduced Km for MgATP. The V/K efficiency ratio of dAK was also increased 29-fold, but that of dGK was decreased to 5-10% due to a 10-fold increase in Km for dGuo and a reduced Vmax. Therefore, the R79K substitution seems to have a greater effect on dGuo binding than on that of dAdo, but dGK modification appears to produce a stimulatory conformational effect on the opposite subunit, resembling the known unidirectional activation of dAK by either dGuo or dGTP.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the heterodimeric deoxyguanosine kinase/deoxyadenosine  kinase of Lactobacillus acidophilus R-26.
AB  - Two uniquely paired deoxynucleoside kinases, deoxycytidine kinase/deoxyadenosine  kinase (dCK/dAK) and deoxyguanosine kinase/deoxyadenosine kinase (dGK/dAK) are required, together with thymidine kinase (TK), for deoxynucleotide synthesis in Lactobacillus acidophilus R-26. Using polymerase chain reaction-generated probes based on N-terminal amino acid sequences, we have cloned tandem genes for 25- and 26-kDa polypeptides, whose derived amino acid sequences and size correspond to wild-type Lactobacillus enzyme subunits. Expression in Escherichia coli uses a single endogenous promoter and yields active dGK/dAK (approximately 3% of extracted protein) closely resembling wild-type dGK/dAK in specificity, kinetics, heterotropic activation, and end product inhibition. Alignment of cloned genes reveals 65% identity in their DNA sequences and 61% identity in derived amino acid sequences. Comparison with herpes-viral TKs reveals three conserved regions: glycine- and arginine-rich ATP-binding motifs and a D/E-R-S/H motif at the putative TK deoxynucleoside site. Greater homology, however, is seen upon multiple alignment of dGK with mammalian deoxycytidine kinases, yielding the consensus sequence-D/E-R-S-I/V-Y-x-D-.dGK also shares a sequence (-Y-D-P-T-I/L-E-D-S/Y-Y-) required for GTP hydrolysis by p21ras.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of acidocin A and cloning of the bacteriocin gene  from Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Acidocin A, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus TK9201, is active against closely related lactic acid bacteria and food-borne pathogens including Listeria monocytogenes. The bacteriocin was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation and sequential ion-exchange and reversed-phase chromatographies. The molecular mass was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography gel filtration to be 6,500 Da. The sequence of the first 16 amino acids of the N terminus was determined, and oligonucleotide probes based on this sequence were constructed to detect the acidocin A structural gene acdA. The probes hybridized to the 4.5-kb EcoRI fragment of a 45-kb plasmid, pLA9201, present in L. acidophilus TK9201, and the hybridizing region was further localized to the 0.9-kb KpnI-XbaI fragment. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of this fragment revealed that acidocin A was synthesized as an 81-amino-acid precursor including a 23-amino-acid N-terminal extension. An additional open reading frame (ORF2) encoding a 55-amino-acid polypeptide was found downstream of and in the same operon as acdA. Transformants containing this ORF2 became resistant to acidocin A, suggesting that ORF2 encodes an immunity function for acidocin A. The 7.2-kb SacI-XbaI fragment containing the upstream region of acdA of pLA9201 was necessary for acidocin A expression in the acidocin A-deficient mutant, L. acidophilus TK9201-1, and other Lactobacillus strains.
TI  - Immunomodulation of human blood cells following the ingestion of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Because of the lack of data that convincingly show immunomodulatory properties of lactic acid bacteria in humans, a study was performed in which healthy volunteers were divided into two groups and given a fermented milk product supplemented with Lactobacillus acidophilus strain La1 or Bifidobacterium bifidum strain Bb 12 for 3 wk. Blood was sampled throughout the study to assess changes in lymphocyte subsets or leukocyte phagocytic activity following consumption of the fermented products. No modifications of lymphocyte subpopulations were detected. In contrast, phagocytosis of Escherichia coli sp. in vitro was enhanced after the administration of both fermented products. The increment in phagocytosis was coincident with fecal colonization by the lactic acid bacteria and persisted for 6 wk after ingestion of the fermented products. By this time, the fecal lactobacilli and bifidobacteria had returned to concentrations prior to consumption. Nonspecific, anti-infective mechanisms of defense can be enhanced by the ingestion of specific lactic acid bacteria strains. These strains can be used as nutritional supplements to improve the immune function of particular age groups, i.e., the neonate or the elderly, for which these functions are diminished.

TI  - [A microflora study of the gastrointestinal tract of mink housed within and outside of the area of the Chernobyl Atomic Electric Power Station].
AB  - Quantitative differences in the content of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the content of the stomach, small and large intestine have been established when studying microflora of the gastrointestinal tract of minks kept in the 30-kilometer zone of the Chernobyl NPP (experimental animals) and at the Cherkassy fur farm (control animals). Obligate heterofermentative species of lactic acid bacteria related to Lactobacillus fermentum and L. reuteri prevailed in the stomach of experimental minks. Species composition of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the stomach of the Cherkassy minks is characterized by the availability of both obligate and facultative heterofermentative species of bacteria--L. bavaricus, L. coryniformis, L. reuteri and of obligate homofermentative bacteria--L. salivarius and L. jensenii. In limiting dilutions (10(-9)-10(-10)) of the content of small intestine of the control minks one could find bacteria of L. coryniformis species and representatives of obligate heterofermentative bacteria--L. confusus and L. fermentum that is 1-2 orders higher then in the experimental minks. Both lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria (the latter up to 10(+9) cells/g of the content) were isolated from the lower departments of small and large intestine of the Chernobyl and Cherkassy minks. Among the species of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the experimental animals homofermentative species (L. acidophilus, L. sharpeae) and, heterofermentative (L. confusus, L. fermentum) in the control were found.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Use of HT-29, a cultured human colon cancer cell line, to study the effect of fermented milks on colon cancer cell growth and differentiation.
AB  - Epidemiological and in vivo and in vitro experimental studies have suggested that fermented milks may interfere with the emergence and/or the development of colon cancer. The results, however, remain inconclusive. This prompted us to develop a new approach based on the use of HT-29, a cultured human colon cancer cell line, to study at the cellular level the effect of fermented milks on colon cancer cell growth and differentiation characteristics. Undifferentiated HT-29 cells have been grown in the continuous presence of milks fermented by one of the following bacterial populations: Lactobacillus helveticus, Bifidobacterium, L.acidophilus or a mix of Streptococcus thermophilus and L. bulgaricus. Penicillin G was added to the cell culture medium, resulting in a complete blockade of bacterial growth without significant effect on bacterial viability. One out of the four bacteria species studied, namely L.acidophilus, was without effect on both cell growth and differentiation. The three other bacterial strains induced a significant, although variable, reduction in the growth rate of HT-29 cells, which resulted in a 10-50% decrease in the cell number at steady-state (i.e. at cell confluency). The most efficient strains in lowering the HT-29 growth rate were L. helveticus and Bifidobacterium. Concomitantly, the specific activities of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV), a sensitive and specific marker of HT-29 cell differentiation, and that of three other brush border enzymes (sucrase, aminopeptidase N and alkaline phosphatase) were significantly increased, thus suggesting that these cells may have entered a differentiation process. Altogether, these results indicate that the use of cultured colon cancer cells may be a useful tool to further study the effect of fermented milks on colon cancer and that bacterial strains may exert a different and specific effect on cancer cell growth and differentiation when used in fermented milk products.
TI  - Viability and enzymatic activity of bifidobacteria in milk.
AB  - Bifidobacterium breve NCFB 2258, Bifidobacterium bifidum NCFB 2715, Bifidobacterium longum ATCC 15707, Bifidobacterium angulatum ATCC 27535, and Lactobacillus acidophilus N2 were evaluated for viability and beta-galactosidase and alpha-galactosidase activities under conditions of refrigerated and frozen storage in reconstituted NDM. beta- and alpha-Galactosidase activities were variable. Bifidobacterium angulatum 27535 exhibited much greater enzymatic activities than those of the other strains. All strains demonstrated culture and enzyme stability upon refrigerated storage in fermented and unfermented reconstituted NDM. Bifidobacteria were significantly less tolerant of low temperature storage than was L. acidophilus N2.
TI  - Enzyme production by lactobacilli and the potential link with infective endocarditis.
AB  - Fifty-six strains of lactobacilli were examined for the production of glycosidases and proteases (arylamidases) that could be associated with the ability to grow in vivo and/or be a factor in the pathogenesis of endocarditis. The strains were from seven species, with an emphasis on Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lact. paracasei subsp. paracasei, both of which have been associated with endocarditis and provided 12 of the 13 strains isolated from cases of the disease. Other species were Lact. acidophilus, Lact. plantarum, Lact. salivarius, Lact. fermentum and Lact. oris. Commonly expressed glycosidase activities were alpha-D-galactosidase and beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase followed by beta-D-glucosidase and alpha-L-fucosidase. The combined production of beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase and alpha-D-galactosidase was a feature of the endocarditis isolates. In contrast, beta-D-galactosidase was produced by very few of the strains within species implicated in endocarditis but most of the strains of Lact. salivarius, Lact. fermentum and Lact. oris. The most commonly produced arylamidases active against substrates employed for testing human blood clotting cascade were activated protein C(Ca)-like, activated factor X(Xa)-like and Hageman factor-like followed by kallikrein-like and chymotrypsin-like enzymes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Anticarcinogenic, hypocholesterolemic, and antagonistic activities of Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus is considered to possess health-promoting attributes. These include anticarcinogenic and hypocholesterolemic properties and antagonistic action against intestinal and food-born pathogens. L. acidophilus can also survive the hostile environment and establish in the complex ecosystem of the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, the beneficial effects of ingesting L. acidophilus accrue over a longer period than those organisms that cannot colonize the gut. However, the exact mechanisms of these attributes are not known. Presumably, the anticarcinogenic activity may be attributed to production of compounds and/or conditions that inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells, suppression of microorganisms that convert procarcinogens to carcinogens, and degradation of carcinogens formed. They hypocholesterolemic effect is probably exerted by inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, which is a rate-limiting enzyme in endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis in the body and by promoting the excretion of dietary cholesterol in feces as a result of coprecipitation in the presence of deconjugated bile acids in the intestine and/or adsorption by the organisms. The antagonistic effect against pathogens and other organisms is possibly mediated by competition for nutrients and adhesion sites, formation of metabolites such as organic acids, hydrogen peroxide, and production of antibiotic-like compounds and bacteriocins.
TI  - A comparative study of the efficiency of a pro-biotic and the anti-K99 and anti-A14 vaccines in the control of diarrhea in calves in Brazil.
AB  - A total of 99 pregnant cows were divided into eight groups submitted to the following treatments: group I (n = 29) consisted of unvaccinated cows whose calves did not receive a probiotic and was used as control. Group II (n = 10) consisted of vaccinated cows whose calves did not receive a probiotic. Groups III, IV and V (n = 10 neach) consisted of vaccinated cows whose calves received a probiotic for 5, 15 and 30 days, respectively. Groups VI, VII and VIII (n = 10 each) consisted of unvaccinated cows whose calves received a probiotic for 5, 15 and 30 days, respectively. Each animal in the vaccinated groups received two 5.0 ml vaccine doses containing pili K99 and A14 of Escherichia coli by the subcutaneous route. The probiotic containing Lactobacillus acidophilus at the dose of 2.0 x 10(8) live cells in 250 ml milk, was administered orally. All animals were observed clinically and bacteriologically and anti-K99 and anti-A14 antibody titers were determined in serum and colostrum. Mean calf weight was measured at birth and at 30 days of age. The results showed that a combination of the vaccine with the probiotic administered for 15 and 30 days was the most efficient treatment for the control of diarrhea.

TI  - The effect of dietary fermented milk products and lactic acid bacteria on the initiation and promotion stages of mammary carcinogenesis.
AB  - The effects of spray-dried yogurt powder product (YPP), bifidobacteria, and Lactobacillus acidophilus were studied during the initiation and promotion phases of carcinogenesis using the 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced mouse mammary carcinogenesis model. In two separate studies, Sencar mice were fed a diet consisting of 86%, 43%, or 0% YPP or 0% YPP, but with added cultures of bifidobacteria or L. acidophilus. When the animals were 55-63 days old, DMBA was administered by intragastric gavage at 1 mg/mouse and continued once a week for six weeks. During the initiation study, the test diets were fed for four weeks before and during DMBA administration. One week after the final DMBA treatment, all animals were switched to a basal diet based on the AIN-76 formulation. For the promotion study, the diets were introduced one week after the final dose of DMBA and fed for the remainder of the study. Palpable tumor development was monitored weekly throughout the studies. For the initiation study, mice fed 86%, 43%, or 0% YPP or 0% YPP supplemented with bifidobacteria or L. acidophilus had a histologically verified mammary tumor incidence of 15%, 35%, 19%, 30%, and 20%, respectively. The histologically verified tumor incidence for the promotion study was 48%, 58%, 36%, 59%, and 43% in the mice fed diets consisting of 86%, 43%, or 0% YPP or 0% YPP supplemented with bifidobacteria or L. acidophilus, respectively. The data indicate that neither the initiation nor the promotion phase of carcinogenesis is significantly affected by diets composed of 86% YPP, 43% YPP, 0% YPP, or 0% YPP supplemented with bifidobacteria or L. acidophilus.
TI  - [Lactose digestion by milk fermented with Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei of human origin].
AB  - The aim of the present study was to determine whether a fermented milk containing Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus strains isolated from human subjects (CFM) and developed by CERELA (Centro de referencia para Lactobacilos) is better tolerated than regular milk (RM) by subjects with lactase deficiency (< 1 unidad) and lactose intolerance. We studied the digestion of the lactose present in the two milk preparations which were administered to 18 healthy subjects with lactase deficiency and 12 control subjects. Each subject ingested in random sequence on different days, 480 ml CFM, 480 ml RM and 240 ml CFM and 240 ml RM. Breath hydrogen (H2) test was used to measure lactose absorption and orocecal transit time (OCTT). The peak H2 ppm results after 480 ml of CFM were ingested, reached 19.5 +/- 12.1 ppm. The same reading when 480 ml of RM were ingested was 52.6 +/- 31.9 ppm (p < 0.008). The results also showed that 480 ml of CFM delayed OCTT median 111.0 +/- 6.78 min versus 54.0 +/- 5.09 min of RM (p < 0.001) and reduced the development of symptoms (p < 0.08) such as bloating (p < 0.05), borborygmi (p < 0.025) diarrhea (p < 0.05) and abdominal colics (p < 0.05). In spite of the small number of cases studied, it seems justified to conclude that CERELA fermented milk significantly influences lactose digestion and minor development of symptoms in lactase-deficient subjects and lengthens significantly the orocecal transit time compared with regular milk.

TI  - Effects of ciprofloxacin and vancomycin on physicochemical surface properties of  Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Under clinical conditions, during antibiotic treatment, micro-organisms often grow at sub-inhibitory concentrations. This may lead to altered adhesive cell surface properties and to a disruption of the indigenous microflora, in addition to the creation of a more pathogenic biofilm. The effects of growing Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli and lactobacilli in the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin and vancomycin were determined. Growing the cells under antibiotic burden sometimes led to altered cell surface hydrophobicity (by adhesion to hexadecane), changes in the pH-dependence of zeta potentials, and elemental surface compositions or in different SDS-PAGE protein profiles. For several isolates only one of the surface properties was altered by the presence of an antibiotic in the growth medium and no systematic effects were observed for all isolates representing a certain species or even strain. The important conclusion to be drawn from the results of this study is that the effects of growing cells under antibiotic burden on their adhesive cell surface properties can only be established when using a variety of techniques.
TI  - [Effects of ingestion of "BON-NARINE" on immune functions in mice].
AB  - A study was carried out to examine the effects of ingestion of "BON-NARINE" (BN)  on mice immune functions. Mice aged 12 weeks were divided into 4 groups. The first group was given BN at 30 mg/kg (BN-30 group), the second group was given BN at 90 mg/kg (BN-90 group), the third group was given zymosan at 50 mg/kg (Zy group) and the fourth group was a control receiving no treatment. The mice of groups BN-30 and BN-90 were given BN p.o. at doses of 30 mg/kg and 90 mg/kg per day for 20 consecutive days, respectively. The mice of group Zy were given zymosan i.p. at a dose of 50 mg/kg per day for 2 consecutive days. The results obtained were as follows: 1) Potentiation of phagocytic function of the reticuloendothelial system, examined by the carbon clearance method, was seen in the BN-30, BN-90 and Zy groups. 2) The glucose consumption of peritoneal macrophages (M phi) increased significantly in the BN-30 and Zy groups, but not in the BN-90 group. 3) Superoxide anion (O2-) production of peritoneal M phi significantly increased in the BN-30 and Zy groups compared with the control group, but an increasing tendency was observed in the BN-90 group. 4) The acid phosphatase (APH), beta-glucuronidase (GLU) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities of peritoneal M phi increased significantly in the BN-30, BN-90 and Zy groups. 5) The proliferation of splenocytes induced by Con A in the BN-30, BN-90 and Zy groups significantly increased compared with the control group. These results demonstrated that the ingestion of "BON-NARINE" promotes phagocytic activity in the reticuloendothelial system in mice and has a stimulatory effect on M phi because of increases in glucose consumption, O2- production, APH, GLU and LDH activities in the peritoneal M phi of mice. BN also intensified the T-cell function represented by Con A-induced splenocyte proliferation.
TI  - Factors involved in adherence of lactobacilli to human Caco-2 cells.
AB  - A quantitative assay performed with bacterial cells labelled with [3H]thymidine was used to investigate factors involved in the adherence of human isolates Lactobacillus acidophilus BG2FO4 and NCFM/N2 and Lactobacillus gasseri ADH to human Caco-2 intestinal cells. For all three strains, adherence was concentration dependent, greater at acidic pH values, and significantly greater than adherence of a control dairy isolate, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 1489. Adherence of L. acidophilus BG2FO4 and NCFM/N2 was decreased by protease treatment of the bacterial cells, whereas adherence of L. gasseri ADH either was not affected or was enhanced by protease treatment. Putative surface layer proteins were identified on L. acidophilus BG2FO4 and NCFM/N2 cells but were not involved in adherence. Periodate oxidation of bacterial cell surface carbohydrates significantly reduced adherence of L. gasseri ADH, moderately reduced adherence of L. acidophilus BG2FO4, and had no effect on adherence of L. acidophilus NCFM/N2. These results indicate that Lactobacillus species adhere to human intestinal cells via mechanisms which involve different combinations of carbohydrate and protein factors on the bacterial cell surface. The involvement of a secreted bridging protein, which has been proposed as the primary mediator of adherence of L. acidophilus BG2FO4 in spent culture supernatant (M.-H. Coconnier, T. R. Klaenhammer, S. Kerneis, M.-F. Bernet, and A. L. Servin, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 58:2034-2039, 1992), was not confirmed in this study. Rather, a pH effect on Caco-2 cells contributed significantly to the adherence of this strain in spent culture supernatant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Effects of skim milk and its fermented product by Lactobacillus acidophilus on plasma and liver lipid levels in diet-induced hypertriglyceridemic rats.
AB  - Effects of skim milk and its fermented product by Lactobacillus acidophilus on plasma and liver triglyceride and cholesterol levels were examined in diet-induced hypertriglyceridemic rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats at 4 weeks of age were fed a hypertriglyceridemic diet that contained 20% coconut oil, 17.5% fructose, and 17.5% sucrose for 14 days. The test diet was supplemented with either 20% skim milk powder or 20% powder of skim milk fermented by L. acidophilus SBT 2062. Hypertriglyceridemia was observed in the control group, but plasma cholesterol levels were not increased. Skim milk suppressed the elevation of plasma triglyceride levels, while its fermented product had no significant effect. Both dairy products prevented the elevation of liver triglyceride and cholesterol levels, but had no effect on plasma cholesterol levels.
TI  - Effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus on iron bioavailability in rats.
AB  - The effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus on iron bioavailability in rats was examined by the hemoglobin regeneration method. For hemoglobin depletion, female Wistar rats were fed an iron-deficient diet at 3 weeks of age for 13 days. Rats were then assigned to one of four groups, such that average blood hemoglobin value and average body weight were similar among the groups. For hemoglobin regeneration, they were fed one of two ferrous sulfate-supplemented diets that contained the following iron levels (mg/kg): 13.7 for two groups; 21.7 for the other two groups. In the two groups fed the same diet, one group additionally received oral administration of 2 ml of skim milk fortified with 0.3% yeast extract once or twice a day for 7 days, and other rats were administered with skim milk fermented by L. acidophilus SBT 2062 in the same manner. Hemoglobin regeneration efficiency (HRE) was significantly higher in the fermented product-given rats than in the skim milk-supplied rats. There was no significant interaction in HRE between the dietary iron group and the oral administration group. These results indicate that L. acidophilus SBT 2062 is effective for increasing of iron bioavailability in rats.
TI  - Pathogenic potential of lactobacilli.
AB  - Lactobacilli are often considered to be commensal or beneficial participants in human microbial ecology and considerable research is being carried out into the effects of the use of lactobacilli as additives in both human and animal diets. However, lactobacilli also cause some human diseases (e.g. dental caries, rheumatic vascular disease, septicaemia and infective endocarditis (IE)), and have recently been identified as potential emerging pathogens in elderly and immunocompromised patients, particularly those receiving broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. The identification of potential pathogenic traits amongst lactobacilli will therefore facilitate the use of the organisms for probiotic purposes. The ability to aggregate human platelets is considered to be a possible pathogenic trait in the progression of IE. A comparison of bacterial cell surface properties amongst L. rhamnosus strains showed that platelets were aggregated by 5/5 IE strains and 8/16 laboratory strains. For the L. paracasei subsp. paracasei strains the respective numbers were 2/5 and 2/9. However two strains, morphological mutants of a non-aggregating strain, which had been re-isolated after passaging through rats were found to aggregate platelets. No loss of aggregating function occurred on extensive subculturing of IE strains. Aggregation also occurred with 11/14 strains for five other species, namely, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus oris, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus salvivarius, with each species being represented indicating that the property is not uncommon in the genus. A comparison of IE and oral isolates of L. rhamnosus and L. paracasei subsp. paracasei and seven other Lactobacillus species, has shown that the binding of both fibronectin and fibrinogen by lactobacilli is greatly increased, up to 50 fold, when the pH is reduced from 7.0 to 5.0. Re-exposing the lactobacilli to a neutral pH environment releases most of the bound proteins, but the amount still remaining bound to the cell is several times more than is bound at neutral pH. Lactobacilli will also bind to the proteins that make up the extracellular matrix of endothelial cells. Lactobacilli bound significantly better to collagen types I and V than to types III and IV (p < 0.01). Further, strains isolated from IE cases, particularly L. rhamnosus strains, bound significantly better to types I and V than did 'normal' strains (p < 0.02). Type V collagen has been demonstrated at the sites of endothelial damage. Thus the binding of lactobacilli, particularly L. rhamnosus to these collagen types may be of importance in the early stages of colonization of the damaged heart valve.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Heterodimeric deoxyguanosine kinase/deoxyadenosine kinase of Lactobacillus acidophilus R-26: heterotropic activation of deoxyadenosine kinase subunit implicated by limited proteolysis and affinity labeling.
AB  - The deoxyguanosine (dGuo) kinase/deoxyadenosine (dAdo) kinase complex of Lactobacillus has been purified to homogeneity by using a newly constructed dATP-Sepharose column as a final step (2700-fold purification). A heterodimeric structure for the complex has recently been established [Ikeda et al. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 5328-5334]. On the basis of the kinetic and structural data accumulated so far, a model for the heterotropic activation of the dAdo kinase subunit by dGuo or dGTP is proposed: (1) there is an intrinsic difference in the enzyme conformation of the two subunits, with the dAdo kinase subunit being in a constrained (closed) state and the counterpart dGuo kinase subunit being in a relaxed (open) state, as reflected in their relative Vmax values and in the presence or absence of heterotropic activation, and (2) the conformational change induced by the binding of dGuo or dGTP to the active site of the dGuo kinase subunit causes the activation of the dAdo kinase subunit through subunit--subunit interactions. These proposed mechanisms are strongly supported by the following new findings made in this work: (1) low concentrations of chaotropic agents such as guanidine--HCl were found to increase the Vmax of dAdo kinase up to 2-fold--in the same kinetic fashion, apparently, as the activation by dGuo--while showing no effect on dGuo kinase; (2) the proteolytic inactivation of dAdo kinase by trypsin is significantly slower than that of dGuo kinase, but its rate of inactivation is stimulated by dGTP to the same level as for dGuo kinase; (3) the activating effect of dGuo on dAdo kinase was abolished in the course of differential proteolytic inactivation of the dGuo kinase by trypsin in the presence of dATP; and (4) photoaffinity labeling with [8-14C]-8-azido-Ade produces a new species of kinase heterodimer in which the dAdo kinase subunit is permanently activated as a result of specific labeling of the dGuo kinase active site.
TI  - Effects of H2O2-producing lactobacilli on Neisseria gonorrhoeae growth and catalase activity.
AB  - In the vagina and endocervix, Neisseria gonorrhoeae must interact with complex microflora. Among these are lactobacilli, which may inhibit the growth of gonococci. Lactobacillus acidophilus, which produce H2O2 (LB+), and L. acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei, which do not produce H2O2 (LB-), were coincubated with catalase-positive and -deficient strains of N. gonorrhoeae. When the incubation medium was maintained at pH 7.3, neither LB+ nor LB- affected gonococcal growth. However, LB+ caused a significant increase in expression of gonococcal catalase, which could be offset by exposure of the bacteria to exogenous catalase. When coincubation medium was at lower pH (4.8-5.0), there was a significant decrease in gonococcal survival and catalase activity, which was only partly reversed by exogenous catalase. Lysates of LB+ also effectively inhibited gonococcal catalase. This inhibition was retained upon heating of the lysate to 100 degrees C for 15 min but was lost with proteinase K treatment. Thus, LB+ may inhibit growth of gonococci by acidification of the environment, secretion of H2O2, and production of protein inhibitors.

TI  - Modulation of a specific humoral immune response and changes in intestinal flora  mediated through fermented milk intake.
AB  - This study was undertaken to elucidate whether eating a fermented milk containing Lactobacillus acidophilus La1 and bifidobacteria could induce changes in intestinal flora and modulate the immune response in man. Volunteers consumed a fermented milk containing L. acidophilus La1 and bifidobacteria over a period of three weeks during which an attenuated Salmonella typhi Ty21a was administered to mimic an enteropathogenic infection. A control group ate no fermented foods but received the S. typhi Ty21a. Faecal flora analyses showed an increase in L. acidophilus and bifidobacterial counts during fermented milk intake. The specific serum IgA titre rise to S. typhi Ty21a in the test group was > 4-fold and significantly higher (P = 0.04) than in the control group. An increase in total serum IgA was also observed. These results indicate that lactic acid bacteria which can persist in the gastrointestinal tract can act as adjuvants to the humoral immune response.
TI  - Effects of Cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate on the adherence of Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus curtisii, and Lactobacillus acidophilus to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A decreased concentration or total disappearance of Lactobacillus acidophilus in the vagina constitutes a frequent observation in bacterial vaginosis. GOAL OF THE STUDY: Cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate has been evaluated in vitro to detect antiadhesive properties at subinhibitory concentrations for Gardnerella vaginalis and Mobiluncus curtisii to vaginal epithelial cells (VEC). STUDY DESIGN: Bacterial strains 14C- and or 3H-labeled were tested for adherence and competition to binding sites in VECs before and after treatment at sub-MIC with cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate. RESULTS: In control tests of adherence, G. vaginalis and M. curtisii had their maximal adhesion at pH 5.4, L. acidophilus at pH 4.4. Preincubation of G. vaginalis and M. curtisii with cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate 2.5 mg/mL (subinhibitory concentration) at pH 5.4 reduced adherence to VECs respectively by 48.3% and 34.1%. The same treatment of L. acidophilus showed no statistically significant difference. Treatment of VECs alone did not modify adherence. Competition tests between L. acidophilus and G. vaginalis and between L. acidophilus and M. curtisii showed that, in small quantities, L. acidophilus could compete with G. vaginalis and M. curtisii for binding sites in VECs at pH 4.4, when pretreated with cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate. At a higher pH (4.8 and 5.4), L. acidophilus in higher quantities did not compete for binding sites occupied by G. vaginalis and M. curtisii. CONCLUSIONS: Cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate at subinhibitory concentrations modifies the adhesiveness of G. vaginalis and M. curtisii to VECs, reducing it by 48.3% and 34.1%, respectively. Adhesion of L. acidophilus to VECs is not impaired by pretreatment with cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate at pH 4.4, even if they are in low number and compete for binding sites against pathogens. At higher pH levels, L. acidophilus did not compete for binding sites occupied by G. vaginalis and M. curtisii.
TI  - Antimutagenicity of fermented milk.
AB  - Reconstituted nonfat dry milk was fermented by Lactobacillus helveticus CH65, Lactobacillus acidophilus BG2FO4, Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus CH3, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191R, and by a mixture of the latter two organisms. The fermented milks were then freeze-dried, extracted in acetone, dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide, and assayed for antimutagenicity in the Ames test (Salmonella typhimurium TA 100) against N-methyl, N'-nitro, N-nitroso-guanidine, and 3,2'-dimethyl-4-amino-biphenyl. Dose-dependent activity was significant against both mutagens in all extracts. Maximal inhibitory activity against 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl and N-methyl, N'-nitro, N-nitroso-guanidine was 2- and 2.7-fold greater, respectively, than that exhibited by extracts of unfermented milk. Extracts of milk fermented by L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191R were examined further. Compounds that were responsible for activity against both mutagens were less soluble in aqueous solutions than in dimethylsulfoxide. Adjustment of milk fermented by L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191R to pH 3, 7.6, or 13 prior to freeze-drying and acetone extraction did not significantly alter the activity specific for 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl. In contrast, compounds with activity specific for N-methyl, N'-nitro, N-nitrosoguanidine were less extractable at pH 7.6. The weak antimutagenicity of unfermented milk was not increased by addition of 2% L-lactic acid.
TI  - Absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium.
AB  - To investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus gasseri, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium longum, Lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and Streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. The production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by HPLC analysis in growing cultures. Resting whole cells from a positive control strain, Eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of .2 mM cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at pH 7.3. However, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. In growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by E. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. None of the test strains showed production of either deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.
TI  - Acidophilus for sertraline-induced diarrhea.

TI  - Identification and purification of a protein that induces production of the Lactobacillus acidophilus bacteriocin lactacin B.
AB  - Lactacin B is a heat-stable bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus N2  that is active against closely related lactobacilli, including Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis (formerly Lactobacillus leichmannii) ATCC 4797. Pure producer cultures propagated in MRS broth (initial pH 6.5) contain no lactacin B; it is detected only in cultures maintained at pH 5.0 to 6.0 and produced optimally at pH 6.0 S. F. Barefoot and T. R. Klaenhammer, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 26:328-334, 1984). Associative growth of producer and indicator, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis ATCC 4797, resulted in production of an inhibitor identical to lactacin B. Associative growth increased lactacin B production from nondetectable levels (< 100 activity units [AU]/ml) to between 3,200 and 6,400 AU/ml in MRS broth (initial pH 6.5) and resulted in early but equal production of lactacin B (approximately 25,600 AU/ml) in broth maintained at pH 6.0. Indicator cells, but not spent culture filtrates, induced lactacin B production. Indicator cells disrupted by a French pressure cell yielded cell-free filtrates containing inducing activity. Chromatofocusing and gel filtration high-performance liquid chromatography of cell-free filtrates yielded a protein with a pI of 4.1 and a molecular size of approximately 58 kDa that induced lactacin B production. Analytical isoelectric focusing yielded a single protein band. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels contained a 28-kDa protein suggesting a two-subunit structure. Protein sequencing identified an N-terminal serine and 18 additional amino acids. To our knowledge, there are not previous descriptions of proteins that induce bacteriocin production in lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Lactulose--a potential drug for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.
AB  - Lactulose is a drug mainly used as a laxative and for the treatment of porto-systemic encephalopathy. Following oral administration, intact lactulose reaches the colon, where it is split by bacteria, leading to a reduction in faecal pH and creating intestinal conditions beneficial to Lactobacillus acidophilus and inhibitory to coliform bacteria, bacteroides, Salmonella and Shigella. It was shown that lactulose therapy clears faecal salmonella and shigella species and reduces the prevalence of urinary-tract infection and respiratory tract infections. Oral administration of lactulose abolishes and prevents systemic endotoxemia of gut origin. Therefore lactulose may be used for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease as bacteria and bacterial endotoxin have an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease.
TI  - Comparisons of freshly isolated strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus of human intestinal origin for ability to assimilate cholesterol during growth.
AB  - Fecal isolates of Lactobacillus acidophilus were obtained from human volunteers and tested for bile tolerance, the ability to deconjugate bile salts, and the ability to assimilate (take up) cholesterol during growth. One hundred and twenty-three of the 304 isolates of lactobacilli obtained were identified as L. acidophilus. In most cases, isolates of L. acidophilus from the same volunteer varied significantly in the amount of cholesterol assimilated, bile salt deconjugated, and bile tolerance. The two cultures from each of nine volunteers that assimilated the most cholesterol were compared as a group to select the most active cultures. Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 43121 (an isolate from the intestines of a pig, which in an earlier study aided significantly in controlling serum cholesterol in pigs) was included in this comparison. Significant variation in the ability to assimilate cholesterol was observed among these isolates from different volunteers. Eight of 17 isolates assimilated numerically but not significantly more cholesterol than L. acidophilus ATCC 43121, and 4 isolates assimilated significantly less. Bile tolerance and bile salt deconjugation also varied significantly among the selected isolates. Six of the selected isolates were quantitatively but not significantly better able to deconjugate bile salts than L. acidophilus ATCC 43121, but none was significantly more bile tolerant. Based on characteristics tested, isolates B7, D3, L1, 016, and 017 have the most potential of those included in this study for use as dietary adjuncts to lower human serum cholesterol.
TI  - Evidence for the presence of plasmids in four therapeutically important strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Four therapeutically important strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus designated as R, 301, 1899 and NCFM were screened for the presence of plasmids. Two lysis methods were used for the isolation of plasmid DNA: an alkaline method and a more gentle technique. It was found that the gentle lysis method yielded better plasmid DNA both quantitatively and qualitatively. All four strains studied apparently possess plasmids. The strains 301 and NCFM possessed one plasmid each, with a size of 4.2 kb, whereas R possessed three plasmids (3.5, 2.4 and 2.1 kb) and 1899 possessed two plasmids (4.1 and 4.2 kb). Restriction analysis revealed that the plasmid DNA from strain R was cleaved by Bam HI but not by Hind III and Eco RI. The plasmid DNA from the remaining three strains was cleaved by all three restriction enzymes used.
TI  - [Protein fingerprinting as a method for strain-specific differentiation of technologically useful Lactobacillus strains from clinical isolates].
AB  - Lactobacilli are often used in products of animal origin because of their technological properties and as protective cultures against pathogenic microorganisms, however they are supposed to be related to human infections as well. Therefore 39 strains of species that are in biotechnological usage, including the type strains, and some clinical isolates were investigated. 9 strains of L. acidophilus, 7 of L. gasseri and 23 strains of L. rhamnosus were tested. Biochemical and physiological properties were proved by classical tests. Analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic protein patterns was performed with diamine silver staining, a technique not previously applied to lactobacilli. Classical tests were able to confirm all strains as belonging to one of the three species. Analysis of protein patterns allowed to differentiate between strains of the same species. In case of L. acidophilus biotechnologically used strains and clinical isolates were clustered separately. L. rhamnosus formed three clusters. SDS-PAGE of proteins together with diamine silver staining seems to be helpful to detect intra-species differences. It was stated, that technologically used strains of lactobacilli could clearly be differentiated from another and also from clinical isolates.
TI  - The effect of Lactobacillus spp. on the attachment of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli to isolated porcine enterocytes.
AB  - A total of 43 strains of lactobacilli were isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of piglets at the time of weaning. Isolates, grown on solid media, were allocated to strongly adherent or non/weakly adherent groups on the basis of numbers attaching to isolated porcine enterocytes. Strains of Lactobacillus fermentum were disproportionally represented amongst the strongly-adherent strains and Lact. acidophilus and Lact. salivarius amongst the non/weakly-adherent group. Lactobacilli showed significantly better attachment ability when grown on agar than when grown in broth culture. Strongly adherent strains were not found to effect the attachment of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli to porcine enterocytes, tested under the conditions of exclusion (lactobacilli added to the enterocytes before E. coli), competition (lactobacilli and E. coli added simultaneously) and displacement (E. coli added before lactobacilli). Tests were made with [14C]-labelled E. coli. Suspensions of bacteria and enterocytes were passed through a filter selected to retain enterocytes but pass free bacterial cells. Counts (dpm) obtained from filters after solubilization were taken as a measure of E. coli attachment. Some strains of lactobacilli coaggregated with enterotoxigenic E. coli with K88 fimbriae, but not with a K88-negative mutants strain. These were excluded from the competitive exclusion experiments. In the apparent absence of a direct effect on the association of E. coli with host tissue, removal of potential gut pathogens by aggregation could contribute to the probiotic properties ascribed to lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of lactobacilli: preliminary characterization and optimization of production of acidocin B, a novel bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus M46.
AB  - Approximately 1000 lactobacillus strains were isolated and screened for the production of antimicrobial activity, using a target panel of spoilage organisms and pathogens. Only eight positive strains were found; two of these were studied in more detail. Lactobacillus salivarius M7 produces the new broad spectrum bacteriocin salivaricin B which inhibits the growth of Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Brochothrix thermosphacta, Enterococcus faecalis and many lactobacilli. A new atypical bacteriocin produced by Lact. acidophilus M46, acidocin B, combines the inhibition of Clostridium sporogenes with a very narrow activity spectrum within the genus Lactobacillus and was selected for further characterization. Acidocin B is sensitive to trypsin, heat-stable (80 degrees C for 20 min) and can be extracted from the culture supernatant fluid with butanol. Native acidocin B occurs as a large molecular weight complex (100 kDa), while with SDS-PAGE the partly purified activity migrates as a peptide of 2.4 kDa. Optimization of the cultivation conditions resulted in an eightfold increase of the amount of acidocin B produced during growth. Growth is not necessary for acidocin B production; washed producer cells can synthesize the bacteriocin in a chemically defined production medium. The application potential of acidocin B is discussed.

TI  - Heterodimeric deoxynucleoside kinases of Lactobacillus acidophilus R-26: functional assignment of subunits using limited proteolysis controlled by end-product inhibitors.
AB  - Heterodimeric quaternary structures for two enzyme complexes from Lactobacillus acidophilus R-26 exhibiting deoxycytidine kinase/deoxyadenosine kinase (I) and deoxyguanosine kinase/deoxyadenosine kinase(II) activities have been proven by the following steps: (1) separation of each complex into two components on SDS-PAGE at pH 6.6; (2) N-terminal amino acid sequencing of each component; (3) functional assignment of each component by differential limited proteolysis. The third step was facilitated by the finding that the binding of a specific end-product inhibitor dNTP, to each kinase active site makes the corresponding kinase subunit resistant to trypsin, while leaving the heterologous kinase subunit susceptible to proteolysis. Analysis on SDS-PAGE has revealed only two fragments (15.8 and 11.0 kDa) following proteolysis of dCyd kinase/dAdo kinase (I) with trypsin in the presence of dATP. This may indicate that the kinase polypeptide chain (27.2 kDa) not protected by dNTP is cut by trypsin at a single specific site, with concomitant loss of activity. Thus, this work presents a unique approach to the clarification of structure and function of enzymes composed of heterologous subunits.
TI  - Microbiological evaluation of jejunal aspirates and faecal samples after oral administration of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - A double-blind placebo controlled investigation was carried out to study the effect of peroral colonization. Human volunteers were given mixtures of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria. Measurements were made over a 1 week treatment period and for another week after the end of the treatment. Two different bacteriological preparations were used, one consisted of Enterococcus faecium and Bifidobacterium longum (a total of 6.4 x 10(8) cfu d-1); the other consisted of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bif. bifidum, Lact. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus (a total of 9 x 10(9) cfu d-1). Together with a placebo preparation, they were given to 24 healthy controls (eight in each group). Microbiological examinations of jejunal aspirates showed that viable counts of most species were below the detection limit. However, the test preparation containing Ent. faecium and Bif. longum significantly reduced the anaerobe: aerobe ratio in faeces by a factor of three during treatment (P = 0.03), and increased it by a factor of 30 during the following week (P < 0.02). This study shows that peroral administration of certain bacterial cultures may affect the distal intestinal microflora.
TI  - Hemagglutination activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus group lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The cells of 28 strains of the Lactobacillus acidophilus group were evaluated for hemagglutination (HA) activity. The activity was found in the surface layer (SL) protein fraction extracted by 2 M guanidine hydrochloride. The most SL proteins from the A group strains (L. acidophilus (A1), L. crispatus (A2), L. amylovorus (A3), and L. gallinarum (A4)) showed HA activity, but the proteins from the B group strains (L. gasseri (B1) and L. johnsonii (B2)) showed no activity. The SL proteins from the A group strains were composed in common of a main component having molecular mass of about 40-45 kDa on SDS-PAGE. The SL proteins from JCM 1034 strain that showed the highest HA activity was fractionated by CM-Toyopearl ion-exchange chromatography. The highest HA activity was detected in the major protein of 41 kDa. This protein was purified and shown to be composed of about 50% of hydrophobic amino acids. The HA activity of the protein (1034 lectin) was specifically inhibited by fetuin and bovine lactoferrin at the concentrations of 80 and 160 micrograms/ml, respectively. The removal of N-acetylneuraminic acid from fetuin significantly decreased the inhibitory activity.
TI  - [The use of the new bacterial biopreparation Acilact in the combined treatment of periodontitis].
AB  - Acilact, a bacterial biopreparation representing a complex of live lyophilized acidophilic lactobacteria, was used in combined therapy of 45 patients with periodontitis of mild and medium severity. The drag was applied locally and per os. Clinical parameters improved after therapy; gram-positive cocci and bacilli predominated in local microflora; natural antibacterial resistance of the body improved. This method of therapy is new in principle and pathogenetically grounded. It results in correction of autoflora of the oral cavity and periodontal pouches, and, possibly, of the gastrointestinal tract. Acilact is well tolerated by the patients and induces no side effects, there are no contraindications against its administration.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus LA 1 binds to cultured human intestinal cell lines and  inhibits cell attachment and cell invasion by enterovirulent bacteria.
AB  - Four human Lactobacillus acidophilus strains were tested for their ability to adhere onto human enterocyte like Caco-2 cells in culture. The LA 1 strain exhibited a high calcium independent adhesive property. This adhesion onto Caco-2 cells required a proteinaceous adhesion promoting factor, which was present in the spent bacterial broth culture supernatant. LA 1 strain also strongly bound to the mucus secreted by the homogeneous cultured human goblet cell line HT29-MTX. The inhibitory effect of LA 1 organisms against Caco-2 cell adhesion and cell invasion by a large variety of diarrhoeagenic bacteria was investigated. As a result, the following dose dependent inhibitions were obtained: (a) against the cell association of enterotoxigenic, diffusely adhering and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhimurium; (b) against the cell invasion by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and Salmonella typhimurium. Incubations of L acidophilus LA 1 before and together with enterovirulent E coli were more effective than incubation after infection by E coli.
TI  - Divergence in codon usage of Lactobacillus species.
AB  - We have analyzed codon usage patterns of 70 sequenced genes from different Lactobacillus species. Codon usage in lactobacilli is highly biased. Both inter-species and intra-species heterogeneity of codon usage bias was observed. Codon usage in L. acidophilus is similar to that in L. helveticus, but dissimilar to that in L. bulgaricus, L. casei, L. pentosus and L. plantarum. Codon usage in the latter three organisms is not significantly different, but is different from that in L. bulgaricus. Inter-species differences in codon usage can, at least in part, be explained by differences in mutational drift. L. bulgaricus shows GC drift, whereas all other species show AT drift. L. acidophilus and L. helveticus rarely use NNG in family-box (a set of synonymous) codons, in contrast to all other species. This result may be explained by assuming that L. acidophilus and L. helveticus, but not other species examined, use a single tRNA species for translation of family-box codons. Differences in expression level of genes are positively correlated with codon usage bias. Highly expressed genes show highly biased codon usage, whereas weakly expressed genes show much less biased codon usage. Codon usage patterns at the 5'-end of Lactobacillus genes is not significantly different from that of entire genes. The GC content of codons 2-6 is significantly reduced compared with that of the remainder of the gene. The possible implications of a reduced GC content for the control of translation efficiency are discussed.
TI  - The interaction of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Trichomonas vaginalis in vitro.
AB  - Recent work with a mouse model of Trichomonas vaginalis infection indicated that  estrogenized BALB/c mice that were preinfected with Lactobacillus acidophilus showed a greater duration of T. vaginalis infection as compared to a control group of mice that were not treated with L. acidophilus. To examine the interaction between T. vaginalis and L. acidophilus further we performed in vitro competitive growth assays between the 2 species. Although the addition of L. acidophilus to the T. vaginalis cultures slowed the growth of the protozoa, the added bacteria did not increase trichomonad death. However, T. vaginalis had a deleterious effect on L. acidophilus growth in combined cultures when compared to matched controls. Using an initial inoculum of 10(5)/ml, at 40 hr the control L. acidophilus concentrations had grown to 1.3 x 10(7)/ml. However, in combined culture with T. vaginalis, L. acidophilus concentrations at 40 hr had fallen to 7.8 x 10(5)/ml and 6.1 x 10(4)/ml for the 10:1 (T. vaginalis at 10(4)) and 1:1 (T. vaginalis at 10(5) test ratios, respectively (P < 0.01). This demonstrates that T. vaginalis can cause the concentration of L. acidophilus to fall in vitro and may explain why the concentration of L. acidophilus in the vagina falls in trichomoniasis.
TI  - [Lactobacilli in the treatment of dyspepsia due to dysmicrobia of various causes].
AB  - In 30 patients with dyspepsia caused by dysbacteriosis of the gastrointestinal tract the authors administered the preparation Lactobacillus acidophilus (Rossel Co. Canada)--1. capsule with 2 billion live bacteria, in the morning after breakfast. The patients were divided into four groups: maldigestion, malabsorption, radiation enterocolitis and administration of antibiotics. The patients recorded themselves their subjective symptoms: pain, pressure, bloating, flatulence and appetite, and as to objective symptoms, the number and consistency of bowel movements, changes of body weight. The most rapid effect was achieved in dysbioses after antibiotics--within 3-4 days normalization occurred which persisted even after discontinuation of the drug. In maldigestion after one week bloating, flatulence, abdominal pain and pressure in the epigastrium was milder, and within two weeks the condition improved further. An excellent effect was achieved in radiation enterocolitis. In patients with lactose intolerance the tolerance of dairy products improved. No side-effects were observed, the preparation was very well tolerated; the mean body weight increment was 0.75 kg in three weeks. The preparation proved a new useful probiotic which is highly effective in dyspepsias caused by dysbiosis of the intestinal microflora.
TI  - Effect of casitone and fructose on the growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus and its survival during storage.
AB  - Supplementation of milk with combination of casitone (0.5% (w/w)) and fructose (0.5% (w/w)) resulted in greater acid production, higher viable counts, increased sugar utilization and shorter generation time for the L. acidophilus strains tested. The experimental product prepared by using these additives contained 1.5-2.0-fold more viable L. acidophilus than the control (no additives) throughout 21 days of storage. Further, both control and experimental products remained acceptable throughout the storage period. However, the former was rated superior in flavor, whereas the latter exhibited better texture.
TI  - Biotherapeutic role of fermented milk.
AB  - Fermented milk was used as therapy in infantile diarrhoea due to post-gastroenteritis syndrome. This treatment eliminated the disease in 4.0 days (mean value, SD = 2.8; n = 13) and allowed patients to return to free feeding according to their age. The weight percentile variation during treatment with fermented milk (15 days) was higher in the patients showing 3rd degree malnutrition than in other children. Bacteriotherapy can restore faecal flora which has been lowered by diarrhoea. Our results showed that levels higher than 10(6) UFC lactobacilli/g of faeces correlated with a healthy status of the children. Clinical applications of fermented milk with a mixture of Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus in the prevention of gastrointestinal disorders are possible.
TI  - Effect of lactic acid bacteria on the intestinal production of lactate and short-chain fatty acids, and the absorption of lactose.
AB  - The characteristic fermentation pattern seen with specific saccharides in incubations with pure cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum disappeared when incubated in 16.7% fecal homogenate. The productions of lactate and short-chain fatty acids in mixed bacterial-fecal incubations were similar to productions in fecal homogenates without L acidophilus and B bifidum and were mainly associated with the specific mono-, di-, and polysaccharides added to the incubate. B bifidum was cultured from ileostomic contents in eight of nine ileostomists after oral administration (2.4 x 10(10) cells), but did not influence the concentrations and productions of DL-lactate and short-chain fatty acids in the ileostomic outputs and incubates. Large amounts of ingested lactic acid bacteria (4.2 x 10(10) cells) did not ameliorate lactose malabsorption measured by the breath-hydrogen test in 12 lactose malabsorbers. This study shows that ingested lactic acid bacteria are indeed present in the colon, but it does not support the theory that they change the pattern of colonic fermentation or the degree of intestinal lactose malabsorption.
TI  - Detection of caries-inducing microorganisms in hyposalivated rats without infection of mutans streptococci.
AB  - Rampant dental caries was induced in hyposalivated rats fed a high sucrose diet without infection of mutans streptococci, in which increased numbers of lactobacilli and S. aureus were demonstrated in the oral flora. Administration of either penicillin or piperacillin, effective against all isolates of lactobacilli, markedly inhibited the caries induction in these rats, while severe dental caries was induced in hyposalivated rats given vancomycin that is inhibitory against S. aureus. These results suggested that certain lactobacilli might induce dental caries in hyposalivated rats fed a sucrose diet. Three strains of Lactobacillus species isolated from the hyposalivated rats were made resistant to erythromycin. The caries-inducing activity of these erythromycin-resistant lactobacilli was studied in hyposalivated rats giving erythromycin in the drinking water at a concentration of 500 micrograms/ml. After a 61-day experimental period, severe dental caries was induced in hyposalivated rats infected with L. fermentum TY1R. On the other hand, low caries incidence was found in hyposalivated rats infected with either L. acidophilus TY7R or L. plantarum TY3R. These results indicate that L. fermentum may be one of causative agents of dental caries in hyposalivated rats fed a sucrose diet.
TI  - [Intestinal dysbacteriosis in yersiniosis patients and the possibility of its correction with biopreparations].
AB  - Intestinal dysbacteriosis was found in all 37 patients with intestinal yersiniosis or pseudotuberculosis. Administration of biopreparations containing lacto- or bifidobacteria produced a good clinico-microbiological response rate (above 90%). The authors think it valid to include biopreparations in combined treatment of yersiniosis to prevent unfavourable outcomes.
TI  - Inhibition of Candida albicans by Lactobacillus acidophilus: evidence for the involvement of a peroxidase system.
AB  - A range of cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus was isolated from patients using oral, vaginal and endocervical swabs. These were investigated for their ability to (1) inhibit the growth of Candida albicans, and (2) generate peroxidase, hydrogen peroxide and hypothiocyanite. Inhibition of Candida albicans and hydrogen peroxide production was detected in nine out of twelve strains whereas peroxidase production was only detected in three out of twelve strains, all from oral swabs. Hypothiocyanite production was detected in two strains and it was only detected in these strains after growth in MRS medium in aerobic conditions.
TI  - Selected nutrient intakes and blood serum mineral concentrations of elderly humans fed regular and sweet acidophilus milks.
AB  - Calorie, protein, fat, calcium, phosphorus and manganese intakes were retrospectively calculated from the self-recorded intakes of 12 elderly humans, who were fed regular and sweet acidophilus milks in addition to their normal free choice diets. Blood serum of the subjects was analyzed for total calcium, ionized calcium, phosphorus and manganese at the beginning of the study, at cross-overtime of milk treatments and at the end of the study. Total serum calcium, serum ionized calcium and phosphorus levels of the subjects were significantly higher at the end of the eight week study compared to pre-study levels (p < 0.05). The kind of milk had no effect on serum levels of total calcium, ionized calcium, phosphorus and manganese. High dietary levels of calcium and phosphorus had no significant effect on serum manganese concentrations.
TI  - Adhering heat-killed human Lactobacillus acidophilus, strain LB, inhibits the process of pathogenicity of diarrhoeagenic bacteria in cultured human intestinal cells.
AB  - Heat-killed L. acidophilus, strain LB, was tested for its ability to adhere in vitro onto human enterocyte-like Caco-2 and muco-secreting HT29-MTX cells in culture. The heat-killed LB bacteria exhibited a high adhesive property. A diffuse pattern of adhesion was observed to the undifferentiated cells, the apical brush border of the enterocytic cells, and to the mucus layer that covered the surface of the mucus-secreting cells. The inhibitory effect of heat-killed LB organisms against the human intestinal Caco-2 cell-adhesion and cell-invasion by a large variety of diarrhoeagenic bacteria was investigated. The following dose-dependent inhibitions were obtained: (i) against the cell-association of enterotoxigenic, diffusely-adhering and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and Salmonella typhimurium; (ii) against the cell-invasion by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella typhimurium.
TI  - The aggregation of human platelets by Lactobacillus species.
AB  - The ability to aggregate human platelets was examined for five Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains and five Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei strains isolated from patients with infective endocarditis (IE), 25 laboratory isolates from the same two species, and 14 strains from five other oral species, namely Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus oris, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus salivarius. Amongst the L. rhamnosus strains, platelets were aggregated by all five IE strains and 8/16 laboratory strains. For the L. paracasei subsp. paracasei strains, the respective numbers were 2/5 and 2/9. Aggregation also occurred with 11/14 strains of the other five species; each species was represented. The optimal ratio of bacteria to platelets for aggregation was approximately 1:1, and there was considerable variation in the lag phase that preceded aggregation, depending on the source of the platelets. Overall, the lag phase varied between 0.25 +/- 0.1 and 20.4 +/- 3.2 min and the percentage aggregation ranged between 70 +/- 2.6 and 104 +/- 13.5%. Confirmation that aggregation was being observed came from studies with five strains on the inhibitory effects of EDTA, dipyridamole, apyrase, imipramine, acetylsalicylic acid and quinacrine. Inhibition of aggregation by L. rhamnosus strains by the peptide arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-serine (RGDS) further indicated a role for fibronectin and/or fibrinogen. Pronase treatment of cells for 1 h and extraction of bacterial surface components with 0.1 M-Tris/HCl (pH 8.5) at 37 degrees C for 1 h stopped aggregation in 8/9 IE strains. Extracted surface proteins (200 micrograms) completely inhibited platelet aggregation by 8/9 of the homologous strains.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of neutralized extracellular culture filtrates of lactic acid bacteria isolated from a cultured Indian milk product ('dahi').
AB  - Neutralized extracellular culture filtrate obtained from isolates of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbruecki ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis from 'dahi' showed weak to moderate inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus brevis, Bacillus circulans, Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus laterosporus, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa when tested by the diffusion agar well assay method. The effective minimum quantity of lactic culture filtrates required to obtain complete inhibition of an inoculum of 10(3) cfu/ml of the bacteria tested was between 20 and 26% (vol/vol), as determined by the agar incorporation method. Neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of these lactic cultures added at a level of 10% in sterile, 10% reconstituted non-fat dry milk was able to either suppress or retard growth of selected bacterial cultures when incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. This study indicated the antimicrobial activity of dahi and the potential of using neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of lactic acid bacteria in the biopreservation of foods.
TI  - Derivation of DNA probes for enumeration of a specific strain of Lactobacillus acidophilus in piglet digestive tract samples.
AB  - Four DNA probes were derived that hybridized specifically to DNA from Lactobacillus acidophilus O. The probes were constructed by randomly cloning lactobacillus DNA in plasmid vector pBR322. Two of the probes (pSR1 and pSR2) were composed of vector and plasmid DNA inserts (3.6 and 1.6 kb, respectively); the others (pSR3 and pSR4) were composed of vector and chromosomally derived inserts (6.9 and 1.4 kb, respectively). The probes were used to enumerate, by colony hybridization, strain O in digestive tract samples collected from piglets inoculated 24 hours previously with a culture of the strain. The probes did not hybridize to DNA from lactobacilli inhabiting the digestive tract of uninoculated piglets. Strain O made up about 10% of the total lactobacillus population of the pars esophagea and about 20% of the population in other digestive tract samples.
TI  - Partial characterization of an rpoD-like gene of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ML3 with a polymerase chain reaction-based approach.
AB  - With degenerated oligonucleotide primers for conserved regions of bacterial sigma factor proteins, a 117-bp internal DNA fragment of an rpoD-like gene of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ML3 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The DNA sequence of this PCR product was determined by cycle sequencing, and the deduced amino acid sequence of this internal fragment showed an extensive homology with the known sigma factor sequences from six other microorganisms and present a 13-amino acid region corresponding to the typical "RpoD box" of primary sigma factors. This PCR product was used as a probe to specifically detect sigma homologs in Pediococcus acidilactici, Leuconostoc lactis, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris. These data are consistent with the existence of a high similarity between the primary sigma factors from diverse Gram-positive microorganisms.
TI  - S-layer protein of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356: purification, expression  in Escherichia coli, and nucleotide sequence of the corresponding gene.
AB  - The cell surfaces of several Lactobacillus species are covered by a regular layer composed of a single species of protein, the S-protein. The 43-kDa S-protein of the neotype strain Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356, which originated from the pharynx of a human, was purified. Antibodies generated against purified S-protein were used to screen a lambda library containing chromosomal L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 DNA. Several phages showing expression of this S-protein in Escherichia coli were isolated. A 4.0-kb DNA fragment of one of those phages hybridized to a probe derived from an internal tryptic fragment of the S-protein. The slpA gene, coding for the surface layer protein, was located entirely on the 4.0-kb fragment as shown by deletion analysis. The nucleotide sequence of the slpA gene was determined and appeared to encode a protein of 444 amino acids. The first 24 amino acids resembled a putative secretion signal, giving rise to a mature S-protein of 420 amino acids (44.2 kDa). The predicted isoelectric point of 9.4 is remarkably high for an S-protein but is in agreement with the data obtained during purification. The expression of the entire S-protein or of large, C-terminally truncated S-proteins is unstable in E. coli.
TI  - Growth of lactobacilli, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in normal and  mastitic milk and whey.
AB  - The growth of three lactobacilli (Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus and L. casei), Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was followed in normal and mastitic milk and whey using the standard plate count method. L. acidophilus, L. bulgaricus 6032 and L. casei 6028 grew well in normal milk, but had decreased growth in mastitic milk if not pre-adapted in mastitic whey. S. aureus 26003 and E. coli 44102 showed enhanced growth in mastitic milk as compared with their growth in normal milk. These mastitis pathogens grew faster than the lactobacilli in both the normal milk and the mastitic milk. Among the lactobacilli, L. acidophilus and L. bulgaricus grew faster than L. casei in both types of milk samples. All the bacteria tested grew well in the normal and mastitic whey samples. However, they seemed to have enhanced growth in mastitic whey with the exception of L. casei. Pre-adaptation of the bacteria in mastitic whey in subculture markedly improved the growth of both pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria in mastitic milk. All the bacteria showed decreased replication in mastitic milk as compared with mastitic whey.
TI  - Augmentation of macrophage phagocytic activity by cell-free extracts of selected  lactic acid-producing bacteria.
AB  - Oral and intraperitoneal administration of lactic acid-producing bacteria can significantly augment the immune response in murine models; however, the immunopotentiating effects in these studies differ significantly. Murine macrophagelike cell line J774 was cultured in the presence of cell-free extracts of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium longum, and the effect on macrophage function was evaluated by measurement of synthesis of selected enzymes and their ability to take up either acrylamide particles or live Salmonella typhimurium. Lysozyme activity of J774 cells was significantly decreased by cell-free extracts of B. longum, but not of L. acidophilus, whereas extracts of both strains induced morphological changes and significantly enhanced phagocytosis of inert particles or viable Salmonella. Whole cell extracts of lactic acid-producing bacteria are therefore capable of altering macrophage function in a strain-dependent manner.
TI  - Rapid Mini-Prep Isolation of High-Quality Plasmid DNA from Lactococcus and Lactobacillus spp.
AB  - A simple, rapid plasmid mini-prep procedure for lactococci and lactobacilli which gives high yields and can be performed on overnight broth cultures is presented. Large plasmids were isolated from both lactococci and lactobacilli, including a 70-kb plasmid from Lactobacillus acidophilus C7. The purity of the resulting plasmid DNA makes it suitable for subsequent molecular manipulations. The convenience of the technique makes this rapid mini-prep procedure suitable for routine plasmid isolation from lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Antibiosis revisited: bacteriocins produced by dairy starter cultures.
AB  - Well before the existence of starter bacteria was recognized, their activities were instrumental in preserving dairy foods. During growth in fermented products, dairy starters, including lactobacilli, lactococci, leuconostocs, streptococci, and propionibacteria, produce inhibitory metabolites. Inhibitors include broad-spectrum antagonists, organic acids, diacetyl, and hydrogen peroxide. Some starters also produce bacteriocins or bactericidal proteins active against species that usually are related closely to the producer culture. Several bacteriocins have been biochemically and genetically characterized. Evaluating properties of the Lactobacillus acidophilus bacteriocin, lactacin B, led to a new purification protocol. Purified lactacin B migrates in SDS-PAGE as a single 8100-Da band with inhibitory activity after Coomassie blue staining. Production of lactacin B is enhanced by cultivation of the producer with the sensitive indicator, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis 4797; understanding this interaction may increase knowledge of production of bacteriocins in heterogeneous cultures. Bacteriocins have been recently identified in dairy propionibacteria. Jenseniin G, a bacteriocin produced by Propionibacterium jensenii P126, has narrow activity; propionicin PLG-1 produced by Propionibacterium thoenii P127 inhibits propionibacteria, some fungi, Campylobacter jejuni, and additional pathogens. Better understanding of these antagonists may lead to targeted biocontrol of spoilage flora and foodborne pathogens.

TI  - Microbial purification technique of mineral dressing plants reject waters.
AB  - Earlier investigations on laboratory and pilot plant scale have shown the resort  to microorganisms to be a practicable approach to the problem of purifying mineral dressing plant reject waters from residual flotation reagents and/or metal ions. In spite of the proven effectiveness of this method, one major drawback, namely the pathogenicity of some microorganisms, has so far hampered its application on a commercial scale. A research programme, aimed at developing a microbial reject water purification technique utilizing non-pathogenic strains was thus drawn up and is currently being implemented. Strains such as Bacillus subtilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, which are not harmful to human health, some of them being commonly found in the human intestine, have been successfully tested for removing alkylsulphates, alkylamines and fatty acids from solutions simulating flotation plant tailings waters. Removals as high as 90% in less than 48 h can be easily achieved with no nutrient requirements, since in most cases the flotation reagent residue to be removed is metabolized by the microorganisms themselves.
TI  - Inhibition of adhesion of enteroinvasive pathogens to human intestinal Caco-2 cells by Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LB decreases bacterial invasion.
AB  - Salmonella typhimurium and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) were found to adhere to the brush border of differentiated human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells in culture, whereas Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Listeria monocytogenes adhered to the periphery of undifferentiated Caco-2 cells. All these enterovirulent strains invaded the Caco-2 cells. Using a heat-killed human Lactobacillus acidophilus (strain LB) which strongly adheres both to undifferentiated and differentiated Caco-2 cells, we have studied inhibition of cell association with and invasion within Caco-2 cells by enterovirulent bacteria. Living and heat-killed Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LB inhibited both cell association and invasion of Caco-2 cells by enterovirulent bacteria in a concentration-dependent manner. The mechanism of inhibition of both adhesion and invasion appears to be due to steric hindrance of human enterocytic pathogen receptors by whole-cell lactobacilli rather than to a specific blockade of receptors.
TI  - The fermentation of trahanas: a milk-wheat flour combination.
AB  - The fermented food, trahanas (a milk-wheat flour combination prepared in Greece), was studied to determine the microbiological and chemical changes that occur during fermentation. It is a lactic acid bacterial fermentation in which Streptococcus lactis, Streptococcus diacetylactis, Leuconostoc cremoris, Lactobacillus lactis, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Lactobacillus acidophilus play the major acid- and aroma-producing role. The whole fermentation lasts about 50 hours. The pH of the final dried trahanas was 4.07-4.75, the acidity 0.60-1.00%, the moisture content 8.6-11.5% and the protein content 10.4-13.6%. The product offers possibilities as an increased nutritive value or high-protein food.
TI  - [Protective effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus on development of infection, caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae].
AB  - The mechanisms of protective action of Lactobacillus have been studied during development of the generalized infection induced by Klebsiella pneumoniae in CBA mice after weaning. The mice were infected intragastrically during the first day after weaning (1 x 10(9) bacterias per mice). Suspensions of Lactobacillus were introduced before and after infection during 10 days (1 x 10(6) bacterias per mice). It has been shown that introduction of Lactobacillus substantially decreased the level of the gut contamination by Klebsiella, prevented generalization of infection and death of animals. Significant higher levels of IgA in the blood serum, IgA and IgM in the gut content, percentage of splenocytes, expressing surface IgM and IgG were observed on the 7th day as compared with those in animals without Lactobacillus. Significantly lower percentage of splenocytes, expressing CD4 antigen was also observed. On the 11th day after infection the mice receiving lactobacillus have shown a tendency to an increase of IgA in the gut content, significantly lower concentrations of IgM in the gut content and a higher level of IgA to the blood serum as compared with the control. Other characteristics were comparable to those of the control group. A conclusion is made that introduction of Lactobacillus prevents development of the Klebsiella infection and protects the immune system from excessive antigenic action.
TI  - [Wound infection in the surgical treatment of children with congenital cleft palate].
AB  - Clinico-microbiologic examinations of 153 children with cleft palate aged 2 to 9  were carried out. Two groups of patients with different pattern of operative wound healing after uranoplasty were singled out: 110 ones with primary healing and 13 ones with infectious inflammations of the wound. The incidence of S. aureus carriership on the palatal mucosa before surgery was higher among patients who developed postoperative inflammations. On day 3 after the operation gram-negative bacilli were isolated from the majority of patients with postoperative wound inflammations coursing in the presence of marked dysbacteriosis as against patients in whom the wounds healed by primary intention. The authors suggest a method for wound infection prevention in uranoplasty, consisting in irrigation of the operative wound with acilact (a biopreparation) suspension and shortening of antibiotic prevention course to just 48-72 h; the efficacy of this method was confirmed by a reduction of the incidence of postoperative complications. Normal microflora representatives predominated in the microbiocenosis of the operative wound on days 3 and 10-12 after uranoplasty.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of the substance isolated from Streptosporangium species which inhibits lactic acid production by oral bacteria.
AB  - 1. The tentatively named MLI, which inhibits lactic acid production in mutants streptococci, was isolated from Streptosporangium species and purified by solvent extraction followed by chromatography, and then powdered. 2. MLI greatly inhibited pH-decline and lactic acid production in glucose-containing reaction mixture by mutans streptococci or Lactobacillus species. 3. These inhibitory mechanisms were not caused by an anti-bacterial effect, since the addition of a sufficient concentration of MLI to inhibit lactic acid production to the culture, recovery of cells in culture was not affected, excluding L. acidophilus. 4. MLI directly affected lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity. 5. These results indicate that MLI may represent a new anti-cariogenic substance.
TI  - In vivo distribution of particulate antigens and liposomes in murine spleen. A possible role in the humoral immune response.
AB  - Several particulate antigens and liposomes were intravenously injected in mice in order to study their localization patterns in spleen and liver. Liposomes have been proposed as promising carriers for haptens and antigens. It was studied whether the phospholipid composition, cholesterol content and charge of the liposomes played a role in their distribution within the spleen. Different thymus-independent type 1 and type 2 and thymus-dependent particulate antigens as well as liposomes were labeled with the lipophilic fluorochrome Di-I. After labeling they were intravenously injected and spleens and livers were removed at different time intervals and prepared for light- and fluorescence-microscopy. We have observed that all particulate antigens and liposomes administered to the mice localized according to the same distribution pattern in the spleen. After 2 and 4 h particles were located in macrophages of the marginal zone and after 24 h white pulp macrophages had also ingested particulate antigens and liposomes. So we conclude that the distribution of the particulate antigens and liposomes in the spleen is independent of the immunological nature of the particles. Results are discussed with respect to the question whether or not the distribution of particulate antigens and liposome associated antigens or haptens, may be a crucial factor in determining the type of immune response to be elicited.
TI  - A quantitative assessment of the antimicrobial activity of garlic (Allium sativum).
AB  - An aqueous extract of freeze-dried garlic (Allium sativum), when incorporated into growth media, inhibited many representative bacteria, yeasts, fungi and a virus. All microorganisms tested were susceptible to garlic. Quantitative assessment of the minimum inhibitory concentrations for bacteria and yeasts showed values ranging from 0.8 to 40.0 mg garlic ml(-1). Fungal radial colony growth was inhibited by at least 25% at concentrations as low as 2.0 mg garlic ml(-1). The 50% endpoint neutralization titre for rotavirus was 2.4 to 2.8 mug ml(-1). Lactic acid bacteria were the least sensitive microorganisms to the inhibitory effects of garlic. In mixed culture studies of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Escherichia coli, garlic prevented the establishment of E. coli, although the final outcome of competition was not affected.
TI  - A simple, low energy requiring method of coagulating leaf proteins for food use.
AB  - A simple method for coagulating proteins in aqueous leaf extract, through microbial fermentation, has been reported. The Leaf Protein Concentrate (LPC) obtained through this fermentation has been compared with those obtained through conventional heat coagulation methods to show that the former improves the yield and nutritional quality of LPC.
TI  - Influence of bile on cellular integrity and beta-galactosidase activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - The influence of bile on beta-galactosidase activity, cellular integrity, cellular retention of beta-galactosidase, and cellular permeability of five strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus was investigated. The five strains were also compared for bile tolerance. Two strains, 223 and 4356, were significantly less resistant to bile than the others (107, NCFM, and 606). beta-Galactosidase activity of all five strains was significantly higher in the presence of .3% oxgall than in its absence. Strain 107 showed the highest increase of enzyme activity in the presence of oxgall. Cells were not lysed in the presence of .3% oxgall, and beta-galactosidase was retained inside the cell even after extended incubation (60 min) in the presence of .3% oxgall. However, material that absorbed light at 260 nm leaked from the cells in the presence of oxgall. We concluded that, in the presence of bile, the permeability of cells of L. acidophilus increased, permitting more substrate to enter the cells, thus increasing the beta-galactosidase activity of whole cells.
TI  - Microflora and acidification properties of yogurt and yogurt-related products fermented with commercially available starter cultures.
AB  - Yogurts and yogurt-related milk products were produced using 44 commercially available starter cultures from 8 suppliers. The yogurt starters consisted of the classical yogurt microflora and the yogurt-related cultures containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and/or Bifidobacterium spp. instead of or in addition to the yogurt bacteria. The counts of lactobacilli in the fresh yogurts varied between 5.5 x 10(7) and 6.5 x 10(8) CFU/ml, and the counts of streptococci varied from 3.5 x 10(7) to 1.2 x 10(9) CFU/ml. About 80% of the yogurts had higher counts of cocci than rods. During storage of the products for 2 weeks at 6 degrees C the stability of the microflora differed markedly among the cultures. In the fresh yogurt-related products the L. acidophilus counts ranged from 4.0 x 10(5) to 2.6 x 10(8) CFU/ml; bifidobacteria were found at levels between 4.0 x 10(6) and 2.6 x 10(8) CFU/ml. In most products reduced viable counts of these bacteria were observed after 2 weeks. Titratable acidity increased on average by 22.3% in the yogurts, and by 14.9% in the yogurt-related products during storage. In most products a higher amount of L(+)- than D(-)-lactic acid was found.
TI  - The vagina as an ecologic system. Current understanding and clinical applications.
AB  - Recent advances in understanding the mechanisms of dominance of the healthful microecology by Lactobacillus acidophilus through microbicidal enzyme systems has led to renewed interest in ecologic approaches to vaginal health maintenance and treatment of vaginosis and vaginitis. Review of pertinent research suggests that due to inadequate adherence of lactobacilli from dairy sources, contaminants in commercial sources, and lack of evidence of effectiveness in sparse clinical trials, intravaginal applications of L. acidophilus cannot be recommended. Bacterial vaginosis is described in this article as a microecologic shift in the dominant organism of the microecology from L. acidophilus to Gardnerella vaginalis. This results in conditions favorable to vaginal establishment of many anaerobic organisms. The ability to identify and nurture healthful lactobacilli in the vaginal microflora is suggested as a future direction for health-enhancement-oriented research, practice, and screening.
TI  - Strain characterization, genome size and plasmid content in the Lactobacillus acidophilus group (Hansen and Mocquot).
AB  - Chromosomal DNA of nine strains of the Lactobacillus acidophilus (Hansen and Mocquot) group in which heterogeneity had previously been revealed by biochemical characteristics and DNA-DNA hybridization studies were further investigated by restriction analysis, Southern hybridization, conventional and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analyses. Industrial strains were characterized and identified as Lact. acidophilus. For this species, the number of rRNA gene clusters was estimated to be at least four from analyses of rRNA gene restriction patterns. The chromosome size of type-strains of Lact. acidophilus and Lact. gasseri was estimated from PFGE analysis to be 1.85 and 2.02 Mb respectively and Lact. gasseri strains were found to contain large-sized linear plasmids.

TI  - The assumed assimilation of cholesterol by Lactobacilli and Bifidobacterium bifidum is due to their bile salt-deconjugating activity.
AB  - To study the mechanism of the propsed assimilation of cholesterol, we cultured various strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus and a Bifidobacterium sp. in the presence of cholesterol and oxgall. During culturing, both cholesterol and bile salts were precipitated. Because of bacterial bile salt deconjugation, no conjugated bile salts were observed in either the culture fluids or the pellets. During incubation, the cell count and optical density decreased. The degree of precipitation of bile salts and of cholesterol was dependent on the culture conditions. If L. acidophilus RP32 was cultured under acidifying conditions, the degree of precipitation of deconjugated bile salts was higher than if the pH was maintained at 6.0. Under acidifying conditions, cholesterol was coprecipitated with the bile salts, whereas in pH-controlled cultures, no coprecipitation of cholesterol was observed. From control experiments with different mixtures of bile salts, it appeared that coprecipitation of cholesterol during culturing was a result of formation of deconjugated bile salts, which have a decreased solubility at pH values lower than 6.0. It is concluded that the removal of cholesterol from the culture medium by L. acidophilus RP32 and other species is not due to bacterial uptake of cholesterol, but results from bacterial bile salt-deconjugating activity.
TI  - Relationship among bile tolerance, bile salt deconjugation, and assimilation of cholesterol by Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - The relationships among growth in the presence of bile, deconjugation of sodium taurocholate, and assimilation of cholesterol by 19 cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus were examined. Cultures of L. acidophilus were grown at 37 degrees C in lactobacilli MRS broth supplemented with sodium thioglycollate, sodium taurocholate, and cholesterol (cholesterol phosphatidyl choline micelles). Deconjugation activity was maximum in the late exponential phase of growth, which also coincided with maximum assimilation of cholesterol. Considerable variation existed among cultures in their ability to grow in the presence of bile, to deconjugate sodium taurocholate, and to assimilate cholesterol. However, statistical analyses revealed no significant correlations.
TI  - In vitro effects of a thiopeptide and monensin on ruminal fermentation of soluble carbohydrates.
AB  - Using a purified diet and a mixed culture of ruminal microorganisms, we studied the in vitro effects of a sulfur-containing peptide (A10255) and monensin on ruminal VFA and lactic acid concentrations. After 22 h of fermentation, total VFA concentration was greater in cultures with A10255 and monensin (2.5 ppm each) than in untreated controls (84.1, 91.9, and 65.2 mM for cultures with A10255, monensin, and control, respectively). The molar proportions of propionate were more than 40% greater, and the molar proportions of acetate were about 15% less, in treated than in untreated cultures. The molar proportions of the remaining VFA were lowest in monensin-treated cultures, intermediate in A10255-treated cultures, and greatest in untreated cultures. Addition of A10255 or monensin also prevented the accumulation of lactate and maintained higher pH than in untreated cultures. In pure culture, growth of Streptococcus bovis was slowed by A10255 at pH 5.5 and 6.5. Growth of S. bovis was reduced markedly with addition of monensin at pH 6.5 and inhibited at pH 5.5. Growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus was inhibited more at pH 5.5 than 6.5 with monensin but was unaffected by A10255. The thiopeptide A10255 and monensin inhibited ruminal lactate production, but sensitivities of lactate-producing bacteria differed between compounds.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Lactobacillus spp. associated with healthy and diseased mucosa of the human intestines.
AB  - Two-hundred and fifty Lactobacillus strains isolated from healthy and diseased mucosa of human intestines of 75 individuals and 49 reference strains were phenotypically classified using 49 unit characters. Data were processed by the Jaccard (SJ) and Simple Matching (SSM) coefficients, and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages. Seventeen major clusters were defined at the 76% SJ-similarity level which approximately correspond to the SSM-level of 91%. Seven clusters could be identified: Lactobacillus plantarum (isolates recovered from 5% of the patients), Lact. casei subsp. rhamnosus (17% of the patients), Lact. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (5% of the patients), Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (3% of the patients), Lact. buchneri (4% of patients), Lact. reuteri (4% of the patients) and Lact. salivarius subsp. salivarius (9% of the patients). Unassigned clusters 1 and 3 both contained homofermentative Lactobacillus strains. Cluster 1 included the type strains of Lact. crispatus, Lact. acidophilus, Lact. jensenii and Lact. gasseri, and cluster 3, the type strains of Lact. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, Lact. agilis and Lact. casei subsp. tolerans. Clusters 1 and 3 were found in 15% and 25% of the patients, respectively. Unassigned clusters 2, 6, 7, 8 and 10 contained homofermentative Lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. Clusters 11, 12, 15 and 17 were made up of heterofermentative Lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. Phenotypical characteristics of the clusters are given. No obvious trends in species (cluster) composition between different intestinal locations could be noted. Most clusters contained isolates from both diseased and healthy mucosa. Exceptions were cluster 15 and cluster 17 which only included isolates from healthy mucosa, and cluster 11 which only included isolates from diseased mucosa. Cluster 15 was isolated in 12% of the patients, and cluster 11 in 8%.
TI  - Adhesion of Lactobacillus acidophilus to avian intestinal epithelial cells mediated by the crystalline bacterial cell surface layer (S-layer).
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus was isolated from washed and homogenized walls of the crop and caecum of an adult fowl. A strain that adhered well in the Fuller adhesion test was subcultured until colonies on Lactobacillus Selective agar changed from rough to smooth. This coincided with a change from aggregate to planktonic growth in liquid medium and a marked loss of ability to adhere. ultrastructure of cells from both types of culture was studied by electron microscopy. An S-layer formed the outermost part of the cell wall in the strongly-adherent strain, whereas this layer was covered with polymerized material or was absent in strains that lacked the ability to adhere, or those with reduced adherence.
TI  - Identification and classification of Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. gasseri and L. johnsonii strains by SDS-PAGE and rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probe hybridization.
AB  - Thirty-two strains originally identified as Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. gasseri were screened for their taxonomic homogeneity by SDS-PAGE of whole-cell proteins. After numerical comparison of the resulting protein electrophoretic fingerprints, two well-delineated clusters were detected. The majority of the strains grouped in one electrophoretic cluster, which contained the type strain of L. acidophilus and corresponds to DNA group A1 of Johnson, J. L., Phelps, C. F., Cummins, C. S., London, J. & Gasser, F. (1980; International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology 30, 53-68). Another cluster corresponded to DNA group B. It contained two subclusters, which agreed perfectly with DNA subgroups B1 (L. gasseri) and B2 (L. johnsonii), respectively. The 23S rRNA genes were partially sequenced and 23S-rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes were designed for identification of DNA groups A1, B1 and B2. Probe Lbg reacted with all strains of electrophoretic cluster B1 (L. gasseri), probe Lbj hybridized with strains of cluster B2 (L. johnsonii) and probe Lba with strains of cluster A1 (authentic L. acidophilus). The probes were successfully used for the identification of strains belonging to the respective species. The phylogenetic relationship of a representative of L. johnsonii was determined by comparative sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA genes. It is very closely related to L. gasseri.
TI  - [Characteristics of lactobacillus species strains isolated from reproductive organs in various clinical cases].
AB  - The study was aimed at detection of presence of Lactobacillus species bacteria in 167 samples of material derived from vagina of patients with cervix uteri (22 samples), chronic vaginosis (100 samples) and from women after treatment of inflammatory diseases (45 samples). Out of 100 isolated strains of Lactobacillus only 13 belonged to L. acidophilus. They were mainly present (10 strains) in patients after effective treatment of inflammatory diseases of reproductive organs. Remaining strains belonged to L. jensenii (18 strains) and Lactobacillus sp. (69 strains) and did not cleave glycogen. This was detected by quantitative determinations of lactic acid in cultures of these bacteria in the fluid media containing 0.25% of glycogen. It seems that treatment of bacterial infections of reproductive organs should be concentrated on not only elimination of pathogenic bacteria, but also on noneffective strains from Lactobacillus species (strains unable to cleave glycogen with production of lactic acid).

TI  - Antigenotoxic properties of lactic acid bacteria in the S. typhimurium mutagenicity assay.
AB  - A high percentage of human tumors is reported to be related to dietary habits. One way to improve the nutritional impact is to increase the intake of protective factors, such as inhibitors of DNA damage and other types of anticarcinogens. Specific strains of lactic acid bacteria used to ferment milk are promising candidates that may be antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic. We have studied the antimutagenicity of 10 isolated strains of beneficial lactic acid bacteria. Four types of fermented milk products were also studied for their protective properties. The effect of these bacteria on the yield of revertants induced by nitrosated beef extract was investigated in the Salmonella typhimurium mutagenicity assay. Eight of 10 isolated Lactobacillus strains reduced the yield of his+ revertants almost back to the levels of the untreated controls. Different fermented fresh yogurts containing viable bacteria (probably Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus or Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacteria) showed protective effects as well. The degree of suppressing revertants was independent of the yogurt's fat content. In contrast, yogurt products that had been heat treated were not inhibitory. The other fresh fermented milk products (e.g., buttermilk, kefir, and "Dickmilch") were not antimutagenic in this study. The results imply that some bacteria used in milk processing have an antimutagenic potential and that this property is specific for the bacterial strain.
TI  - In vitro studies on the growth of Shigella sonnei by Lactobacillus casei and Lact. acidophilus.
AB  - The inhibitory effect of lactobacilli on growth of Shigella sonnei was studied. The effect was not due to pH alone, as addition of hydrochloric, lactic or acetic acids to culture media did not inhibit the normal growth of the shigellas. The degree of inhibition was measured by disc assay and showed that the inhibitory substance(s) can be extracellular and diffusible, varying the degrees of inhibition depending on the media tested. When broth was inoculated with mixed cultures of Lactobacillus and Shigella strains, the inhibition began at 6 h and the death phase at 9 h. The higher inhibition was produced by the mixture of lactobacilli (35.5 +/- 2.5% at 6 h culture, 57.4 +/- 1.9% at 9 h and 91.2 +/- 1.2% at 14 h). The degree of inhibition was higher when the relationship pathogen : lactobacilli was 1:10(3). The specific growth rate of lactobacilli and shigella was different in pure or mixed cultures. When the lactobacillus alone was grown for 12 h and the shigellas then added, the numbers of shigellas began to decrease immediately at 37 degrees C. This work shows that the Lactobacillus strains employed in fermented milk can be used to inhibit the growth of Sh. sonnei.
TI  - Binding of Lactobacillus reuteri to fibronectin immobilized on glass beads.
AB  - Human fibronectin was immobilized on glass beads. The beads were used to evaluate binding of Lactobacillus reuteri to fibronectin. Organisms bound to the glass beads were detected using fluorescence microscopy after treatment with acridine orange. This binding was confirmed and quantified with the use of [3H]-labelled organisms. Three strains of Lactobacillus reuteri, three strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus and one strain of Lactobacillus fermentum were tested for binding capacity. L. reuteri strain 1063 exhibited a strong binding to the immobilized fibronectin, and L. acidophilus 1754 showed a slight binding. The binding of L. reuteri to the fibronectin was mediated by a protein as judged by the absence of binding after treatment of the bacteria with proteolytic enzymes. Treatment of the bacteria with urea, SDS and heat (80 degrees C) also reduced binding. Treatment of the bacterial cells prior to the assay with fibronectin interfered with binding. Albumin did not show this interaction.
TI  - Lectin-like activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus strain JCM 1026.
AB  - The lectin-like activity of the Lactobacillus acidophilus strain JCM 1026 was studied by hemagglutination and hemagglutination-inhibition assays. L. acidophilus strain JCM 1026 was found to hemagglutinate human and animal erythrocytes. Neuraminidase-treatment of human-type O erythrocytes enhanced the activity. Treatment of the bacterial cells with proteinase K reduced hemagglutinating activity significantly. Although several mono- and disaccharides did not inhibit hemagglutination, several different glycoproteins did. These data indicate that a proteinaceous lectin-like component(s) recognizing carbohydrate-containing molecules is located on the cell surface of L. acidophilus.
TI  - Studies on antimutagenic effect of milk cultured with lactic acid bacteria on the Trp-P2-induced mutagenicity to TA98 strain of Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - The inhibitory effects of cultured milk using 76 strains of lactic acid bacteria  isolated from milk products were investigated on the mutagenicity of 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P2), a tryptophan pyrolysate for Salmonella typhimurium TA98. Each cultured milk sample displayed its characteristic antimutagenic effect against the mutagenicity of Trp-P2. The milk cultured with Lactobacillus acidophilus LA106 (LA2) showed the highest inhibition of 82.1% among the strains used. Milk samples cultured with Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lll103 (10-3) and Lll102 (KM) also exhibited higher inhibition percentages.
TI  - Inhibition of Shigella sonnei by Lactobacillus casei and Lact. acidophilus.
AB  - The protective effect of feeding milk fermented with a mixture of Lactobacillus casei and Lact. acidophilus against Shigella sonnei was studied. There was a 100% survival rate in mice fed for 8 d with fermented milk and then dosed orally with Sh. sonnei. The survival rate in control mice was approximately 60% after 21 d. Colonization of the liver and spleen with Sh. sonnei was markedly inhibited by pretreatment with fermented milk. Differences in cell counts of 2-3 log units between treated and control mice were always obtained, shigellas were not detected in these organs by the 10th day in treated mice, while high levels were maintained in the controls. Higher levels of anti-shigella antibodies were found both in sera and in small intestinal fluid of mice treated with fermented milk, suggesting that the protective immunity could be mediated by the mucosal tissue. These results suggest that milk fermented with Lact. casei and Lact. acidophilus could be used as a prophylactic against gastrointestinal infections by shigellas.
TI  - A Lactobacillus helveticus-Specific DNA Probe Detects Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms in This Species.
AB  - A cloned 2-kb EcoRI fragment (fragment f) from a 34-kb plasmid of Lactobacillus helveticus CNRZ 1094 was shown by dot blot to specifically hybridize to total DNAs of 75 L. helveticus strains. No hybridization was found with L. acidophilus, L. crispatus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, L. gasseri, or L. intestinalis strains. When Southern blots of EcoRI digests of L. helveticus strains were probed with fragment f, these strains displayed restriction fragment length polymorphisms on the basis of which they could be grouped into several clusters.
TI  - Serum cholesterol levels in axenic mice colonized with Enterococcus faecium and Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Hypocholesterolemic effect was shown in axenic, mono, bicolonized and conventional mice: the effect was different depending on probiotic properties of intestinal microorganisms. Contamination by Enterococcus faecium CX determined the highest effect: haematic cholesterol level decrease was 16.9% in females and 7.8% in males. In mice contaminated by Lactobacillus acidophilus N5 the decrease of haematic cholesterol levels was less and not relevant in mice contaminated by conventional microflora. Enterococcus faecium CX and Lactobacillus acidophilus N5 strains were able to grow in presence of bile salts, to colonize intestinal tract, to survive at gastric conditions and to assimilate cholesterol (E. faecium more than L. acidophilus). The authors consider the possibility to associate probiotic strains with these characteristics for the health of consumers.
TI  - Transient colonization of the gut of newborn infants by orally administered bifidobacteria and lactobacilli.
AB  - We investigated if orally administered bifidobacteria and/or lactobacilli could be cultured from faeces of infants after antibiotic treatment, when these bacterial species are usually absent. Lyophilized Bifidobacterium longum, strain BB-536, B. breve, strain BB-576, or Lactobacillus acidophilus, strain LAC-343, were used. Doses of 3 x 10(9) cells of one strain, or a mixture of all three strains 3 x 10(9) cells each were fed three times daily at mealtimes to 11 infants aged 0-8 weeks. Treatment was started the first day after antibiotic treatment and was continued for 5 days. The bacterial species were isolated in 9 of 11, 7 of 10 and 2 of 9 specimens obtained on the last day of bifidobacteria or lactobacilli administration, 5 and 15 days thereafter, respectively. No side effects were noted.
TI  - Reader identifies yogurt containing culture effective in relieving candidal vaginitis.
AB  
TI  - Effect of tomato juice addition on the growth and activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Addition of tomato juice to skimmed milk stimulated the growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus. It resulted in higher viable counts, shorter generation time and improved sugar utilization with more acid produced and lower pH for the strains tested. Varying results were obtained for the five strains examined.
TI  - Adhesion of human Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LB to human enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells.
AB  - Twenty-five strains of lactobacilli were tested for their ability to adhere to human enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells in culture. Seven Lactobacillus strains adhered well to the Caco-2 cells, of which three possessed calcium-independent adhesion properties. A high level of calcium-independent adhesion was observed with the human stool isolate Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LB. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that this strain adhered to the apical brush border of the cells. Adhesion increased in parallel with the morphological and functional differentiation of the Caco-2 cells. Two Lactobacillus components were involved in this adhesion. One was protease-resistant and bacterial-surface-associated; the other was heat-stable, extracellular and protease-sensitive.
TI  - Two cases of endocarditis due to Lactobacillus species: antimicrobial susceptibility, review, and discussion of therapy.
AB  - Endocarditis caused by lactobacilli may lead to death or to relapse of infection, despite antimicrobial treatment. We report two cases of lactobacillus endocarditis in individuals with native bicuspid aortic valves who survived without relapse and review the 39 other cases reported in the literature. In only 15 previously reported cases have patients been cured with medical therapy alone. One of our patients, who was infected with Lactobacillus acidophilus, was cured by medical therapy alone, and our other patient, who was infected with Lactobacillus casei subspecies rhamnosus, required surgical replacement of his aortic valve. L. acidophilus was tolerant and L. casei subspecies rhamnosus was resistant to many antibiotics tested. Combinations of penicillin or daptomycin and gentamicin were synergistic by time-kill assay. Synergistic therapy with a penicillin and an aminoglycoside was effective clinically and appears to provide optimal medical treatment on the basis of microbiological data.
TI  - Lactobacilli, anticarcinogenic activities and human intestinal microflora.
AB  - Lactobacilli belong to the normal oropharyngeal and intestinal microflora in humans. These microorganisms contribute to the stabilization of the microflora and maintain the colonization resistance against pathogens. Lactobacilli have been used as dietary supplements in order to prevent gastrointestinal disturbances. Claims have been made that certain strains of lactobacilli possibly exert anticarcinogenic activities. The activity of bacterial enzymes, implicated in colon carcinogenesis may be elevated by a high meat, Western-type diet. Supplements of Lactobacillus acidophilus decreased these levels in both rats and humans. Colon cancer patients given L. acidophilus fermented milk showed a significant increase both in numbers of intestinal lactobacilli and dietary calcium intake, while decreasing trends in levels of both soluble faecal bile acids and faecal bacterial enzymes, two risk makers for colon cancer, were observed. In vitro studies have revealed that lactobacilli and other lactic acid bacteria have the ability to absorb cooked food mutagens. Recent studies in humans have shown that intake of L. acidophilus significantly reduced the mutagen excretion after consumption of fried meat. Several mechanisms by which lactobacilli might exert anticarcinogenic effects are discussed. Thus, certain strains of lactobacilli might lower the colon cancer risk in humans.
TI  - Accelerated natural lactic fermentation of cereal-based formulas at reduced water activity.
AB  - Energy required to dehydrate fermented cereal-based food formulas plays a significant part in the production cost. Therefore the effect of reduced moisture content on the fermentation was investigated. Generally, lactic fermentation at reduced moisture content resulted in increased final pH. Significant acidification still occurred at 0.33 kg water/kg dry matter corresponding to either aW = 0.925 in a sorghum-maize-soya (SMS) mixture, or aW = 0.950 in a sorghum-maize-milk powder (SMM) mixture. Acidification adequate for microbiological safety (pH < or = 4.5) was achieved at 0.54 kg water/kg dm in SMS (aW = 0.950) and 0.43 kg/kg dm in SMM (aW = 0.965). In stable accelerated natural lactic fermentations obtained by inoculum recycling ('back-slopping') at 30 degrees C, dominant lactic acid bacteria included Lactobacillus plantarum, L. brevis, L. acidophilus and Lactococcus lactis. Dominating yeasts were Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida krusei. L. plantarum isolated from high-moisture (1.5 kg/kg dry matter) SMS fermentations had higher specific growth rates than L. plantarum isolated from reduced moisture (0.54 kg/kg dm) SMS fermentations, when tested under similar aW conditions. This effect was not caused by previous culturing conditions; probably different strains of L. plantarum having different aW-optima dominate at high or reduced moisture conditions.
TI  - Purification and some properties of acidocin 8912, a novel bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus TK8912.
AB  - Acidocin 8912, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus TK8912, was purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation and successive chromatographies on CM-cellulose, Sephadex G-50, Sephadex G-25, and reversed-phase HPLC on Aquapore RP-300. The purified acidocin 8912 migrated as a single band on SDS-PAGE. The molecular weight was estimated to be 5200 by SDS-PAGE, and 5400 by HPLC gel filtration on TSKgel G3000PWXL. Both the amino acid composition and the N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis indicated that acidocin 8912 was a peptide composed of presumably 50 amino acids containing a Lys residue at the N-terminus. The purified acidocin 8912 showed a bactericidal effect on sensitive cells but not a bacteriolytic effect.
TI  - Taxonomic study of the Lactobacillus acidophilus group, with recognition of Lactobacillus gallinarum sp. nov. and Lactobacillus johnsonii sp. nov. and synonymy of Lactobacillus acidophilus group A3 (Johnson et al. 1980) with the type strain of Lactobacillus amylovorus (Nakamura 1981).
AB  - Biochemical properties and DNA-DNA reassociation studies of Lactobacillus acidophilus strains isolated from humans and animals indicate that these include six genomospecies. Two new species can be differentiated from the established species of the genus Lactobacillus: L. gallinarum sp. nov. (type strain, ATCC 33199) and L. johnsonii sp. nov. (type strain, ATCC 33200). Furthermore, it was clarified that L. acidophilus group A3 (Johnson et al. 1980) is synonymous with L. amylovorus.
TI  - [Phosphoenolpyruvate:hexose phosphotransferase systems in Lactobacillus species].
AB  - The substrate range of phosphoenolpyruvate:hexose phosphotransferase systems (hexose-PTSs) in Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei LAC3 and L. acidophilus LAC5 was examined. Strain LAC3 demonstrated PTS activities for glucose (Glc), mannose (Man), glucosamine (GcN), 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) and fructose (Fru), while strain LAC5 showed the activities only for Man and Fru. These activities were all constitutive. Growth of both strains was strongly inhibited by 2DG. 2DG-resistant mutants DG329 and DG504 were isolated, respectively, from strains LAC3 and LAC5. Mutant DG329 grown on Glc was defective in all the above-described activities observed with strain LAC3, whereas no defect in PTS activities was found in mutant DG504. Mutant DG329, however, showed some inducible activities for Man and Fru when grown on Man, Fru or Scr. These results strongly suggest that strain LAC3 has inducible PTS(s) specific for Man and/or Fru besides the well-known, broadly specific, constitutive Man-PTS, and also that strain LAC5 lacks the Man-PTS, but has other constitutive PTS(s) specific for Man and/or Fru. L. fermentum LAC12 had the Man-PTS as reported previously (Nagasaki et al., 1992), but had no inducible activities like those found in strain LAC3.
TI  - Protein-mediated adhesion of Lactobacillus acidophilus BG2FO4 on human enterocyte and mucus-secreting cell lines in culture.
AB  - The adhesion of Lactobacillus acidophilus BG2FO4, a human stool isolate, to two human enterocytelike cell lines (Caco-2 and HT-29) and to the mucus secreted by a subpopulation of mucus-secreting HT29-MTX cells was investigated. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the bacteria interacted with the well-defined apical microvilli of Caco-2 cells without cell damage and with the mucus secreted by the subpopulation of HT29-MTX cells. The adhesion to Caco-2 cells did not require calcium and involved an adhesion-promoting factor that was present in the spent supernatant of L. acidophilus cultures. This factor promoted adhesion of poorly adhering human Lactobacillus casei GG but did not promote adhesion of L. casei CNRZ 387, a strain of dairy origin. The adherence components on the bacterial cells and in the spent supernatant were partially characterized. Carbohydrates on the bacterial cell wall appeared to be partly responsible for the interaction between the bacteria and the extracellular adhesion-promoting factor. The adhesion-promoting factor was proteinaceous, since trypsin treatment dramatically decreased the adhesion of the L. acidophilus strain. The adhesion-promoting factor may be an important component of Lactobacillus species that colonize the gastrointestinal tract.
TI  - Mouse intravaginal infection with Trichomonas vaginalis and role of Lactobacillus acidophilus in sustaining infection.
AB  - Recent work with a mouse model of Trichomonas vaginalis infection indicated that  only 25% of mice harbor Lactobacillus spp. and that T. vaginalis infection rates fall rapidly after 7 days postinfection. In women infected with T. vaginalis, there is a disruption of the Lactobacillus population, which usually predominates. In an attempt to establish a better mouse intravaginal infection that resembles human disease, we established Lactobacillus acidophilus in estrogenized BALB/c mice. T. vaginalis was then inoculated intravaginally into mice previously infected with L. acidophilus and into mice in an untreated group. From 52 mice, 50-microliters vaginal washes were collected, cultured, and examined daily for live trichomonads after inoculation. Although initial infectivity in the two groups was comparable (79 to 83%), L. acidophilus-infected mice showed greater duration of infection. At day 24 postinfection, 69% of L. acidophilus-infected mice were still infected with T. vaginalis compared with only 11% of untreated mice (P = 0.002). The addition of L. acidophilus did not significantly alter the resident mouse vaginal flora. By the addition of L. acidophilus, the mouse will be valuable for studying factors involved in T. vaginalis infectivity and pathogenicity.
TI  - Survival of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum in ice cream for use as a probiotic food.
AB  - Probiotic ice cream was made by fermenting a standard ice cream mix with Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum cultures and then freezing the mix in a batch freezer. Survival of the L. acidophilus and B. bifidum, as well as beta-galactosidase activity, was monitored during 17 wk of frozen storage at -29 degrees C. After freezing of the fermented mix, bacterial counts were 1.5 x 10(8) cfu/ml for L. acidophilus and 2.5 x 10(8) cfu/ml for B. bifidum. Seventeen weeks after freezing, these counts had decreased to 4 x 10(6) and 1 x 10(7) cfu/ml, respectively. During the same period, beta-galactosidase activity decreased from 1800 to 1300 units/ml. Probiotic ice cream was prepared at pH 5.0, 5.5, and 6.0 to determine consumer preferences and was compared with standard Utah State University "Aggie" ice cream. All samples were strawberry-flavored and were evaluated by 88 judges. The preferred pH of probiotic ice cream, based on overall acceptance, was pH 5.5. We demonstrated that probiotic ice cream is a suitable vehicle for delivering beneficial microorganisms such as L. acidophilus and B. bifidum to consumers. The bacteria can be grown to high numbers in ice cream mix and remain viable during frozen storage.
TI  - Hydrogen peroxide production by Lactobacillus species: correlation with susceptibility to the spermicidal compound nonoxynol-9.
AB  - Facultative anaerobic lactobacilli were recovered from the vaginas of 96.8% of 63 nonpregnant, healthy, premenopausal women. The predominant species were Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus casei. Of the women, 74.6% had hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli, 22.2% had non-hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli, and 3.2% had no lactobacilli. None of the 68 isolates had catalase activity. Some 68.2% of the isolates were inhibited by concentrations of less than or equal to 1% (wt/vol) of nonoxynol-9 (bactericidal for 73.3% of isolates, bacteriostatic for 26.7%). The remaining 31.8% could grow in all concentrations to 25% (wt/vol) of nonoxynol-9. All of the lactobacilli that were sensitive to nonoxynol-9 produced hydrogen peroxide whereas only 3 of 21 resistant strains were hydrogen peroxide producers. A significant correlation (P less than .001, chi 2 test) was found between hydrogen peroxide production and sensitivity to nonoxynol-9. It is suggested that the vaginal flora of spermicide users could be depleted of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli, possibly increasing susceptibility to urogenital infection.
TI  - Comparison of contact angles and adhesion to hexadecane of urogenital, dairy, and poultry lactobacilli: effect of serial culture passages.
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the hydrophobicities of 23 urogenital, dairy, poultry, and American Type Culture Collection isolates of lactobacilli and to determine the effect on hydrophobicity of serially passaging the strains in liquid medium. To this end, strains were grown after isolation and identification and then serially passaged up to 20 times. Hydrophobicity was assessed through contact angle measurements on lawns of cells by using water, formamide, methylene iodide, 1-bromonaphthalene, and hexadecane as wetting agents and through measurement of their partitioning in a hexadecane-water system. The hydrophobicities of these strains varied widely, with Lactobacillus casei strains being predominantly hydrophilic and L. acidophilus strains being mostly hydrophobic. For some isolates, serial passaging was accompanied by a clear loss of hydrophobic surface properties, whereas for other strains, cultures became heterogeneous in that some cells had already lost their hydrophobic surface properties while others were still hydrophobic. Adhesion of this collection of lactobacilli to hexadecane droplets in microbial adhesion to hexadecane (MATH) tests was driven by their aversion to water rather than by their affinity for hexadecane, as concluded from the fact that hexadecane contact angles were zero for all strains. Furthermore, adhesion of the lactobacilli to hexadecane in MATH tests occurred only when the water contact angle on the cells was above 60 degrees.
TI  - Treatment of bacterial vaginosis with lactobacilli.
AB  - 60 women with bacterial vaginosis were entered into a double blind, placebo-controlled treatment trial with lyophilized Lactobacillus acidophilus. The lactobacilli used were producing H2O2. Immediately after completion of treatment, 16 out of 28 women who were treated with lactobacilli had normal vaginal wet smear results, in comparison to none of the 29 women treated with placebo. All women harboured Bacteroides at inclusion. Bacteroides was eliminated from the vagina of 12 out of 16 healthy women after treatment. Only three of the women who received the Lactobacillus suppository were free of bacterial vaginosis after the subsequent menstruation.
TI  - Bacterial growth inhibition and short-term clinical efficacy of a vegetable oil-based mouthrinse: preliminary study.
AB  - Bacterial growth of a vegetable oil-based product was determined in vitro. Growth of Streptococcus mutans and Veillonella alcalescens was strongly inhibited for dilutions up to 50x. On the basis of these results, it was decided to evaluate the short-term, clinical efficacy of a 1:10 dilution of the concentrated product in water. Fifteen human volunteers employed this rinse twice-a-day during a six-day period. Planimetric plaque scores, as well as the plaque and gingival indexes according to Loe, were assessed at the beginning and end of this period. The efficacy of such a rinse, though less than of chlorhexidine-based products, turned out comparable to several other commercially available products with a reasonable potential in maintaining a low gingival index.
TI  - Bacterial flora of the respiratory tracts in chickens with a particular reference to Lactobacillus species.
AB  - The effects of three different types of breeding such as isolator, floor, and cage breedings on the bacterial flora of the respiratory tracts (nasal cavity, tongue, pharygolarynx, trachea and air sac) in chickens were determined. Total viable bacterial numbers on the nasal mucus of chickens in the isolator breeding as control group (Group A) aged of 14 days were 10(4.6)/g of autopsy specimen (wet weight), 10(5.7)/g of sample in the cage breeding (Group B) aged of 28 days, and 10(7.0)/g of sample in the floor breeding (Group C) aged of 28 days. Staphylococci and micrococci were predominant bacteria in the nasal cavities of all groups. Total viable numbers of tongue and pharygolarynx were from 10(5.4) to 10(6.5)/g of autopsy specimen. Lactobacilli were the predominant bacteria in pharyngolarynx of chickens. The incidence of staphylococci and micrococci in trachea was lower than those in the another regions. Staphylococci and micrococci dominated in the air sacs of two groups (B and C), but the number and incidence of lactobacilli in the air sacs of chickens were lower than those in the another respiratory tracts. The only clostridia isolation in the air sacs of Group A was observed. A total of 75 strains of Lactobacillus species was isoalted from all respiratory organs and intestine of chickens. These strains were divided into 19 groups. Lactobacillus salivearius subsp. salivarius was the predominant lactobacilli isolated from tongue and pharyngolarynx. Most of isolates from the chicken intestines were mainly identified as the L. acidophilus group and L. reuteri.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Antimutagenicity of milk cultured with lactic acid bacteria against N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine.
AB  - The antimutagenic effect of cultured milk using 71 strains of lactic acid bacteria belonging to the genus Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Lactococcus, and Bifidobacterium on the mutagenicity of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine was investigated in vitro using Salmonella typhimurium TA 100 as an indicator bacterium. Each cultured milk sample displayed its characteristic antimutagenic effect on the mutagenicity of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. The milk cultured with Lactobacillus acidophilus LA 106 (LA2) showed the highest inhibition of 77% against the mutagenicity of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine among the strains tested. Changes in the antimutagenic effect of the milk cultured by Lb. acidophilus LA 106 (LA2) during incubation were also examined using N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine as a mutagen.

TI  - Systematics of the Lactobacillus population on rat intestinal mucosa with special reference to Lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  - The systematics of the Lactobacillus population of the intestines of 88 different rats was studied; 80 rats had been fed on fermented oat-meal soup (Molin et al. 1992). One-hundred-twenty-two Lactobacillus strains from the intestinal mucosa were phenotypically classified together with twenty-eight reference strains of Lactobacillus and Leuconostoc, using 49 unit characters. Data were examined using Jaccard coefficient, and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages. Two major and eleven minor clusters were defined at the 76% SJ-similarity level: Cluster 1 included thirty isolates which could not be identified further, but had resemblance to the type strains of L. jensenii, L. gasseri, L. crispatus, and to some extent to L. acidophilus. Cluster 12 including fifty-four intestinal isolates was identified as L. reuteri; and so was cluster 13 (five isolates). Isolates of the major clusters were found in all parts of the intestines. The genomic homogeneity of the L. reuteri isolates was scrutinized by endonuclease restriction analysis of the chromosomal DNA, and the isolates could be divided into six genomic strains.
TI  - Competitive exclusion of diarrheagenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) from human enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells by heat-killed Lactobacillus.
AB  - Diarrheagenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) bearing CFA/I or CFA/II adhesive factors specifically adhere onto the brush border of the polarized epithelial human intestinal Caco-2 cells in culture. Heat-killed Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LB, that adheres onto Caco-2 cells, inhibits diarrheagenic Escherichia coli adhesion in a concentration-dependent manner. Since the L. acidophilus does not express ETEC-CFA adhesive factors, it can be postulated that the heat-killed L. acidophilus LB cells inhibit diarrheagenic E. coli attachment by steric hindrance of the human enterocytic ETEC receptors.
TI  - Genetics of antagonistic action and drug resistance inLactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus has been recommended as a dietary adjunct because of its antagonistic action toward intestinal pathogens and anti-carcinogenic and hypocholesterolemic activities. ManyL. acidophilus strains harbour plasmids and such strains generally produce bacteriocin(s). Resistance to antibiotics has also been shown to be linked with plasmids. Gene transfer and cloning systems are being developed forL. acidophilus which should permit the rapid genetic characterization of desired species and their modification to obtain predetermined traits. Drug resistance determinants and production of antibiotic-like substances may serve as suitable markers for the study and development of these genetic systems. Recent developments in gene transfer systems have been reviewed here.
TI  - Ingestion of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus as prophylaxis for candidal vaginitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether daily ingestion of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus prevents vulvovaginal candidal infections. DESIGN: Crossover trial for at least 1 year during which patients were examined for candidal infections and colonizations while receiving either a yogurt-free or a yogurt-containing diet. Patients served as their own controls. SETTING: Ambulatory infectious disease center in a teaching hospital providing tertiary care. PATIENTS: Thirty-three women with recurrent candidal vaginitis were eligible after recruitment from community practices and clinics and through advertising. Twelve patients were eliminated for protocol violations. Of the remaining 21 patients, 8 who were assigned to the yogurt arm initially refused to enter the control phase 6 months later. Thus, 13 patients completed the protocol. INTERVENTIONS: Women ate yogurt for 6 months of the study period. MEASUREMENTS: Colonization of lactobacilli and candida in the vagina and rectum; candidal infections of the vagina. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-three eligible patients were studied. A threefold decrease in infections was seen when patients consumed yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus. The mean (+/- SD) number of infections per 6 months was 2.54 +/- 1.66 in the control arm and 0.38 +/- 0.51 per 6 months in the yogurt arm (P = 0.001). Candidal colonization decreased from a mean of 3.23 +/- 2.17 per 6 months in the control arm to 0.84 +/- 0.90 per 6 months in the yogurt arm (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Daily ingestion of 8 ounces of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus decreased both candidal colonization and infection.
TI  - Enumeration of subgingival species on primary isolation plates using colony lifts.
AB  - This study evaluated the feasibility of using a colony lift method and DNA probes to enumerate bacterial species cultured on primary isolation plates. Fourteen digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosomal DNA probes representing 12 subgingival species were validated by hybridization with colony lifts prepared from 249 reference strains of 51 species grown on Trypticase soy agar plates supplemented with 5% sheep blood. Colonies of reference strains were lifted onto Nytran filters from plates and treated to lyse cells, remove cellular proteins, denature and fix microbial DNA to the filters. Positive reactions were detected with an anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and revealed by bromo-chloro-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium. Cross-reactions were not observed for 13/14 probes, but 2 strains of Streptococcus mitis reacted with the probe to Streptococcus sanguis II. Subgingival plaque samples were taken by means of a sterile curette from mesiobuccal surfaces of teeth present in each of 26 subjects with differing periodontal disease states. Samples were dispersed, diluted, plated and incubated anaerobically for 7 d at 35 degrees C. Colonies were lifted as described above. Filters were cut into sections and hybridized with the 14 digoxigenin-labeled DNA probes. The probes were used to enumerate the test species and the total number of isolates was determined in 711 plaque samples. The colony lift method and DNA probes provided a sensitive, economical and quantitative method for enumerating cultivable microbial species in subgingival plaque samples. In addition, the amplification provided by growing the organisms on agar plates facilitated determination of numbers of organisms in small plaque samples, such as those from healthy sites.
TI  - Antibodies in normal and diseased pulps reactive with microorganisms isolated from deep caries.
AB  - Immunoglobulin molecules in the supernatant fluids (SF) from pulpal explant cultures have been observed to react with microorganisms implicated in infections of root canals. In this study, the reactivity of immunoglobulin molecules in the SF from normal and irreversible pulpitis pulps to six strains of predominant microorganisms isolated from the immediate layer of carious lesions above the pulps used for explant cultures was investigated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Two ATCC strains of Eubacterium were also included in this assay. Specific antibodies to Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, Lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus (I), (II), Streptococcus mutans, Bacteroides intermedius, Eubacterium brachy, and Eubacterium alactolyticum in the SF from the normal and irreversible pulpitis tissues were observed with a large variation of antibody levels in both groups. Immunodiffusion assays of the SF revealed that IgG was the major class of immunoglobulin in the normal as well as the irreversible groups. The presence of natural antibodies in the normal pulps suggested a possible protective role of antibodies during the invasive process of caries.
TI  - Interferon induction in murine peritoneal macrophage by stimulation with Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Induction of interferon for a kind of dairy lactic acid bacteria, Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus), was investigated in murine peritoneal macrophage (M phi) cultures. Lactobacillus acidophilus JCM 1034, 1132T, 1229 and 2125 induced IFN (12-34 I.U./ml) in M phi cultures in vitro. Strain 1132T- and 2125-induced IFNs were characterized as IFN alpha/beta by treatment with anti-IFNs serum. The results indicate that the inducing activity of IFNs may be one of the available biological parameters for designating the dairy products containing L. acidophilus as "physiologically functional foods."
TI  - Heterogeneity of S-layer proteins of Lactobacillus acidophilus strains.
AB  - An S-layer (surface regular array) was found in the cell wall from six out of ten strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus examined by electron microscopic observations. All of the six strains which were shown to carry the S-layers belonged to the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) homology group A, but not to B, which had been classified by Johnson et al (Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 30: 53-68, 1980). On the other hand, the other four strains which possessed no S-layers were in the homology group B. The apparent molecular weights of the S-layer proteins ranged from 41 to 49 kDa as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Of the S-layer proteins from the six strains, three were susceptible to chemical cleavage with N-chlorosuccinimide, giving different peptide maps. All of the six S-layer proteins were fragmented by limited proteolysis with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, and gave markedly different peptide patterns by the subsequent peptide mapping analysis, except that the peptide maps of the S-layer proteins from the two strains which were in the same subgroup were identical.
TI  - Effect of Bifidobacterium bifidum and Lactobacillus acidophilus on gut mucosa and peripheral blood B lymphocytes.
AB  - In 15 elderly individuals lyophilized Bifidobacterium bifidum (BB) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) (Infloran) were administered in capsules (two capsules 4 times per day) for 28 days, while in 10 elderly controls placebo were given the same posology and for an equal period of time. The effects of this treatment on the immune system both at the periphery or the intestinal level were investigated. Results show that BB and LA significantly reduced the colonic inflammatory infiltration, without altering T, B and Leu7 + cell percentage. At the same time, a significant increase of B cell frequency in the peripheral blood was noted, in comparison to controls. The overall results suggest that the regular administration of BB and LA leads to a modulation of the immunological and inflammatory response in elderly subjects.
TI  - [High-dose oral bacteria-therapy for chronic non-specific diarrhea of infancy].
AB  - The Authors evaluate the effectiveness of oral bacteriotherapy using a combination of anaerobe fecal Lactobacilli for chronic non specific diarrhea of infancy. A double blind study was carried out in a total of 40 children treated with low and high doses of bacteria. The results confirm the importance of fecal flora in this disease and support the hypothesis that oral bacteriotherapy can improve clinical and laboratory presentation especially when given at high doses.
TI  - [Survival of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium sp. in the small intestine following ingestion in fermented milk. A rational basis for the use of probiotics in man].
AB  - Oro-ileal intubation was performed in 6 healthy volunteers who ingested, either 100 g of a fermented milk containing 10(8)/g Lactobacillus acidophilus and 10(7)/g Bifidobacterium sp or sterilized fermented milk along with a meal in random order. Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium were counted in the ileal fluid which was aspirated continuously for 8 h, and flow rates were calculated using the constant slow infusion of PEG 4000. After ingestion of fermented milk but not after control, hourly ileal flow rates of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium increased form 4.8 +/- 0.2 and 4.9 +/- 0.6 to 7.2 +/- 0.3 and 8.0 +/- 0.3, respectively (mean +/- SE log10 CFU). 8.3 +/- 0.2 Lactobacillus acidophilus and 8.8 +/- 0.1 Bifidobacterium were recovered in the ileum which represented 1.5 percent and 37.5 percent of the ingested bacteria, respectively. In conclusion, under usual conditions of fermented milk ingestion, a large number of living Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium pass through the upper gastrointestinal tract and reach the colon.
TI  - [The effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum on the intestinal ecosystem of the elderly patient].
AB  - The authors have tested the therapeutic efficacy of a multibacterial combination  consisting of Lactobacillus acidophilus (10(9)) and Bifidobacterium bifidum (10(9)) in elderly patients with bowel disorders. Bacteriological and histopathologic investigation showed this combination to yield excellent biologic results with restoration of duodenal bacterial flora and subsidence of clinical symptoms. The function of the muciparous glands was restored and the duodenal mucosa was normalized.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria in the gut in normal and disordered states.
AB  - The human gut flora is a complex and finely balanced ecosystem which plays an important protective role in humans. Although relatively stable, its composition may be altered in various disease states and by the administration of antimicrobial agents. Preparations containing viable lactic acid bacteria of human origin appear to have value in restoring normal microbial function and alleviating symptoms in some patients with gastrointestinal infection and other conditions.
TI  - Heat-killed Lactobacillus acidophilus inhibits adhesion of Escherichia coli B41 to HeLa cells.
AB  - Escherichia coli B41 (O101: K99: F41: ST+) adheres to HeLa 229 cells in a diffuse pattern. Heat-killed (100-105 degrees C) Lactobacillus acidophilus (Lacteol strain) was found to inhibit this adhesion in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibitory action was lost after lysis of the L acidophilus, suggesting steric hindrance of E coli adhesion sites rather than competition for a common binding site. A thermostable factor (100-105 degrees C) excreted by L acidophilus into the medium may be required for the adhesion of L acidophilus to HeLa cells, and for the inhibition of adhesion of E coli to these cells.
TI  - Noncariogenicity of erythritol as a substrate.
AB  - Erythritol is a sugar alcohol produced by Aureobasidium sp. from glucose. It is 75-80% as sweet as sucrose and is also nonhygroscopic. The aim of this study was to evaluate this sugar substitute from a cariological point of view. Erythritol was neither utilized as a substrate for the lactic acid production nor for plaque formation of mutans streptococci (serotypes a-h) and certain oral microorganisms. It was not utilized for water-insoluble glucan synthesis or cellular adherence by glucosyltransferase from Streptococcus mutans PS-14 (c) and Streptococcus sobrinus 6715 (g). Finally, a significantly lower caries score (3.1 +/- 0.5; mean +/- SEM) was observed in specific pathogen-free rats infected with S. sobrinus 6715 and fed with a diet containing 26% erythritol, as compared to control rats fed with a diet containing 26% sucrose (60.5 +/- 2.0). Also, rats provided a diet containing 56% erythritol chocolate (23.8% erythritol) and challenged with S. mutans PS-14 exhibited a significantly lower caries score (6.7 +/- 0.8) compared to the sucrose chocolate group (82.8 +/- 2.8). The main conclusion from this study is therefore that erythritol is a promising sugar substitute from a cariological point of view.
TI  - Effects of the spermicidal agent nonoxynol-9 on vaginal microbial flora.
AB  - The use of nonoxynol-9--containing vaginal contraceptive preparations increases vaginal (and urethral) colonization by Escherichia coli. Nonoxynol-9 is toxic to various microorganisms, including Lactobacillus acidophilus, but has little or no direct effect on E. coli. L. acidophilus, which is present in the vaginas of most normal women, generates H2O2 which, when combined with peroxidase and a halide, was toxic to E. coli. This toxicity was inhibited by nonoxynol-9 due to the selective destruction of the lactobacilli. In contrast, at higher concentrations, nonoxynol-9 was toxic to E. coli when combined with peroxidase and a halide. This toxicity was shared with certain other nonionic detergents and was due to the formation of peroxides in the preparations on prolonged exposure to oxygen. E. coli colonization may, in part, reflect the balance between these opposing effects of nonoxynol-9 on the vaginal antimicrobial system. Further, damage to normal tissues by peroxides in nonoxynol-9 preparations needs to be considered.
TI  - [The effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus "Solco" on the immunological indices of  totally decontaminated mice under complete gnotobiological isolation].
AB  - The possibility of stimulating the immunity of totally decontaminated mice, kept  isolated under germ-free conditions, with the use of killed L. acidophilus Solco strains has been studied. As revealed in this study, the oral and intraperitoneal administration of strains O1 and O6 to mice leads to a significant increase in the content of immunoglobulin-synthesizing cells in the jejunal lamina propria of the animals. The oral administration of L. acidophilus Solco strain O6 and the intraperitoneal injection of L. acidophilus Solco strain O1 have been found to lead to a significant rise in the level of luminol-dependent chemiluminescence of mouse peritoneal macrophages. The total decontamination of mice induces the development of secondary immunodeficiency which influences the effectiveness of immunostimulating agents.
TI  - Osmotically Regulated Transport of Proline by Lactobacillus acidophilus IFO 3532.
AB  - [This corrects the article on p. 2831 in vol. 57.].
TI  - Strains and species of lactic acid bacteria in fermented milks (yogurts): effect  on in vivo lactose digestion.
AB  - Lactose in yogurt with live bacteria is better tolerated than lactose in other dairy foods, partly because of the activity of microbial beta-galactosidase (beta-gal), which digests lactose in vivo. To evaluate the ability of different strains and species of lactic acid bacteria to digest lactose in vivo, yogurts (containing mixtures of strains of Streptococcus salivarius subsp thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus) and fermented milks (containing individual species of S thermophilus, L bulgaricus, L acidophilus, or Bifidobacterium bifidus) that varied in microbial beta-gal activity were produced. Selected products were fed to healthy people who cannot digest lactose, and breath hydrogen production was monitored. All yogurts dramatically and similarly improved lactose digestion, regardless of their total or specific beta-gal activity. The response to fermented milks varied from marginal improvement with B bifidus milk to nearly complete lactose digestion with L bulgaricus milk. The results suggest that total beta-gal was not the limiting factor in promoting lactose digestion, perhaps because of a limited rate of intracellular substrate transport.
TI  - Antibiotic production by the marine photosynthetic bacterium Chromatium purpuratum NKPB 031704: localization of activity to the chromatophores.
AB  - Over 200 strains of marine purple photosynthetic bacteria were isolated. Two strains showed antibiotic activity towards Saccharomyces cerevisiae and were tentatively identified as Chromatium purpuratum. Crude antibiotic, prepared by solvent extraction, showed a broad antimicrobial spectrum. The highest activity was found in the chromatophore fraction. Chromatographic separation of purified light harvesting complex from one strain, NKPB 031704, showed the presence of two separate pigmented compounds which were responsible for antimicrobial activity. Our findings reveal the unexpected ability of photosynthetic bacteria to produce broad spectrum antibiotics. In addition, this is the first example of intracellular localization of antibiotic activity in a marine bacterium.
TI  - Nutritional quality of lupine (Lupinus albus cv. Multolupa) as affected by lactic acid fermentation.
AB  - The effects of selected NRRL strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. buchneri, L. cellobiosus and L. fermentum upon oligosaccharide, phytate and alkaloid contents, as well as on the nutritive value of lupine, were investigated. Lupine was processed to a 12% total solids suspension, inoculated with 1% (v/v) cultures and fermented until a final desired pH of 4.5. L. acidophilus B-2092 and L. buchneri B-1837 growth was related to a significant sucrose breakdown and decreases of phytates, whereas L. acidophilus B-1910 and L. fermentum B-585 reduced the content of flatulence oligosaccharides. The activity of L. acidophilus B-1910 was particularly associated with lowering of alkaloids and increase of riboflavin. Lactic acid fermentation produced slight changes in lysine and methionine contents. No significant differences in net protein ratio values and protein digestibility were found between fermented and unfermented lupine (P less than 0.05). A 1:1 ratio mixture of B-1910 and B-2092 strains of L. acidophilus lead to a final fermented lupine with nutritional advantages to those given by the individual cultures.
TI  - Bacteriocin-mediated inhibition of Clostridium botulinum spores by lactic acid bacteria at refrigeration and abuse temperatures.
AB  - The bacteriocinogenicity of Lactococcus lactis ATCC 11454, Pediococcus pentosaceus ATCC 43200, P. pentosaceus ATCC 43201, Lactobacillus plantarum BN, L. plantarum LB592, L. plantarum LB75, and Lactobacillus acidophilus N2 against Clostridium botulinum spores at 4, 10, 15, and 35 degrees C was investigated by modified deferred and simultaneous antagonism methods. All the strains, except L. acidophilus N2, produced inhibition zones on lawns of C. botulinum spores at 30 degrees C. L. plantarum BN, L. lactis ATCC 11454, and P. pentosaceus ATCC 43200 and 43201 were bacteriocinogenic at 4, 10, and 15 degrees C. Supplementation of brain heart infusion agar with 0 to 5% NaCl increased the radii of inhibition zones during simultaneous antagonism assays. Detectable bacteriocin activities were extracted from freeze-thawed agar cultures of L. plantarum BN and L. lactis ATCC 11454 which had been grown at 4 and 10 degrees C. These results suggest that low levels of L. plantarum BN or L. lactis ATCC 11454, in the presence of 3 or 4% NaCl, could be formulated into minimally processed refrigerated food products for protection against possible botulism hazards.
TI  - Osmotically regulated transport of proline by Lactobacillus acidophilus IFO 3532.
AB  - We reported previously that, when exposed to high osmotic pressure, Lactobacillus acidophilus IFO 3532 cells accumulated N,N,N-trimethylglycine (glycine betaine), which serves as a compatible intracellular solute. When grown in medium with high osmotic pressure, these cells also accumulated one amino acid, proline. The uptake of [3H]proline by resting, glucose-energized cells was stimulated by increasing the osmotic pressure of the assay medium with 0.5 to 1.0 M KCl, 1.0 M NaCl, or 0.5 M sucrose. The accumulated [3H]proline was not metabolized further. In contrast, there was no osmotic stimulation of [3H]leucine uptake. The uptake of proline was activated rather than induced by exposure of the cells to high osmotic pressure. Only one proline transport system could be discerned from kinetics plots. The affinity of the carrier for proline remained constant over a range of osmotic pressures from 650 to 1,910 mosM (Kt, 7.8 to 15.5 mM). The Vmax, however, increased from 15 nmol/min/mg of dry weight in 0.5 M sucrose to 27 and 40 nmol/min/mg of dry weight in 0.5 M KCl and in 1.0 M KCl or NaCl, respectively. The efflux of proline from preloaded cells occurred rapidly when the osmotic pressure of the suspending buffer was lowered.
TI  - Molecular cloning and deoxyribonucleic acid polymorphisms in Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus gasseri.
AB  - Lactobacillus strain ADH is a bile-resistant, bacteriocin-producing human isolate that was phenotypically classified within the Lactobacillus acidophilus group. Total DNA and phage DNA extracted from strain ADH were separately digested with BclI and ligated with BclI-digested pGK12. Following electroporation of these ligation mixtures directly into strain ADH, electrotransformants were recovered at frequencies of 1.5 x 10(3) and 2.0 x 10(4)/micrograms of pGK12 for preparations of pGK12::phage DNA and pGK12::total DNA, respectively. Among the electrotransformants screened, 6 and 22% contained passenger DNA of either phage DNA or chromosomal origin, respectively, as determined by restriction-enzyme analyses and hybridization assays. Derivatives of pGK12 containing passenger DNA of chromosomal (pTRK120) or phage (pTRK121) origin and pTRK15 (native cryptic plasmid) were evaluated for use as species-specific probes. The strain ADH-derived probes hybridized primarily to members of the B-1 and B-2 lactobacilli homology groups and demonstrated strain-specific polymorphisms within these groups. Identical hybridization patterns were established for strain ADH and Lactobacillus gasseri VPI 6033 (ATCC 19992). Identification of DNA probes and establishment of a host-vector cloning system have facilitated our efforts to characterize the Lactobacillus chromosome and to distinguish between closely related species thought to be important inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of lactobacilli and streptococci.
AB  - Of nine strains of lactic acid bacteria commonly used as starter cultures for the dalry industry and ensiling, six (Lactobacillus bulgaricus, L. casei, L. acidophilus CH=5, L. plantarum, Streptococcus latis and Strep. taecium) had antibiotic activity. Gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive than Gram-negative bacteria to the antibiotics. The most sensitive strain of Staphylococcus aureus was used as a target micro-organism for the characterization of the antimicrobial substance. The cultures of Streptococcus faecium and L. plantarum gave the most intense antimicrobial activity. Adding CaCO3 to the medium (to bind accumulated lactic acid) increased the antibiotic activity of the lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - [Prevention of late abortion and high risk premature labor--measures suited for routine practice].
AB  - Ascending infection is likely to be the main cause of late abortion and early delivery. In a retrospective evaluation performed at our hospital, evidence of infection was encountered in 76% of 195 pregnancies with premature infants having birth weights less than 2000 g. It may be assumed that the processes responsible for this development take place at the lower pole. It was against this background that we developed a programme designed to contribute to an effective prevention of late abortion and early delivery. The essential requirement is that measurements of vaginal pH enter into routine use during prenatal care. This simple procedure allows for the identification of many (not all) vaginal disorders that might occur in patients at risk. In the presence of other serious anamnestic or diagnostic evidence of imminent late abortion or early delivery, specific bacteriologic examinations including a check-up for chlamydia, vaginal ultrasonography of the cervix and testing for CRP should be carried out. Lower pole lavage, a procedure recently developed by the authors, facilitates the identification of pathogens in the upper part of the infected area, as compared to conventional vaginal and cervical smear. Following are the most important therapeutic measures: An early total blockage of the os uteri is desirable in patients with a clinical history of late abortion or premature infants with little chance of surviving. Acidifying local treatment with Lactobacillus acidophilus is recommended in the presence of abnormally high vaginal pH values (over 4.2). If pathogenic or potentially pathogenic micro-organisms are identified in the upper part of the infected area, local antibiotic therapy should be resorted to, if useful; otherwise systemic antibiotics should be given. If the patient shows definite symptoms of imminent late abortion or early delivery (e.g. critical cervical findings and/or premature labour and/or positive CRP values), systemic wide-spectrum antibiotics should be administered, even if no pathogens have been encountered. The first assessments of the effectiveness of this programme have shown that since its institution in 1989 and 1990, the incidence of underweight infants (birth weight below 1500 g) was significantly reduced at this hospital (by 30%) as compared to the years 1987 and 1988. On the other hand, the incidence of larger underweight infants having a birth weight of 1500 g and more was shown to rise slightly by 9%, while the total number of underweight infants remained unchanged (8.7%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Study on the activity of a therapeutic bacterial combination in intestinal motility disorders in the aged].
AB  - The possible beneficial effects and changes in the histology of the duodenojejunal and colonic mucosa brought about by oral bacterial therapy were studied in 60 elderly patients (mean age +/- SD: 76.6 +/- 5.3 years) with bowel disorders mainly represented by diarrhea accompanied by abdominal pain and meteorism. All patients were submitted to a 7-day washout followed by treatment with 6 capsules daily, each capsule containing live, lyophilized Lactobacillus acidophilus (10(9) CFU/ml). The clinical course was observed in 50 patients while the remaining 10 were hospitalized and submitted to esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy and colonoscopy both before and after treatment for withdrawal of duodenal secretion and fragments of duodenojejunal and colonic mucosa biopsies. Duodenal secretion was examined bacteriologically, and after treatment an increase of the anaerobic flora at the expense of the aerobic one was found together with improved quality of the former. Histologic examination showed reduction of the inflammatory infiltration by lymphocytes and plasma cells and increased muciparous activity of the glands. Clinically, a marked improvement of the symptoms was observed in all 60 patients.
TI  - Single-stranded DNA plasmid, vector construction and cloning of Bacillus stearothermophilus alpha-amylase in Lactobacillus.
AB  - Vector plasmids were constructed by ligating chloramphenicol and erythromycin resistance genes to TaqI-digested DNA of a cryptic plasmid from Lactobacillus plantarum. The minimal region of Lactobacillus plasmid DNA that was required for DNA replication was defined and a single-stranded DNA intermediate replication system was observed. Homologies with other origins of replication of plasmids from Gram-positive bacteria, replicating via rolling circle mechanism, were found. It was shown that the constructed vectors, named pPSC20 and pPSC22, were transformable into L. plantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli. Using plasmid pPSC22, the alpha-amylase gene of Bacillus stearothermophilus was cloned and expressed in several Lactobacillus species.
TI  - Viricidal effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus on human immunodeficiency virus type 1: possible role in heterosexual transmission.
AB  - Peroxidase, H2O2, and a halide form a powerful antimicrobial system in phagocytes and tissue fluids, and certain microorganisms can serve as the source of H2O2 for this system. H2O2-generating Lactobacillus acidophilus (LB+) is present in the vagina of most normal women and peroxidase has been detected in vaginal fluid. LB+ at high concentration is viricidal to HIV-1, and, at levels where LB+ is ineffective alone, the addition of peroxidase (myeloperoxidase, eosinophil peroxidase) and a halide (chloride, iodide, bromide, thiocyanate) restore viricidal activity. LB+ can be replaced by H2O2, but not by non-H2O2-producing LB, and viricidal activity is inhibited by azide and catalase. The survival of HIV in the female genital tract and thus the likelihood of transmission may be influenced by the activity of the LB(+)-peroxidase-halide system in the vagina.
TI  - Incompatibility of Lactobacillus Vectors with Replicons Derived from Small Cryptic Lactobacillus Plasmids and Segregational Instability of the Introduced Vectors.
AB  - Three new Lactobacillus vectors based on cryptic Lactobacillus plasmids were constructed. The shuttle vector pLP3537 consists of a 2.3-kb plasmid from Lactobacillus pentosus MD353, an erythromycin resistance gene from Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pE194, and pUC19 as a replicon for Escherichia coli. The vectors pLPE317 and pLPE323, which do not contain E. coli sequences, were generated by introducing the erythromycin resistance gene of pE194 into a 1.7- and a 2.3-kb plasmid from L. pentosus MD353, respectively. These vectors and the shuttle vector pLP825 (M. Posno, R. J. Leer, J. M. M. van Rijn, B. C. Lokman, and P. H. Pouwels, p. 397-401, in A. T. Ganesan and J. A. Hoch, ed., Genetics and biotechnology of bacilli, vol. 2, 1988) could be introduced by electroporation into Lactobacillus casei, L. pentosus, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. fermentum, and L. brevis strains with similar efficiencies. Transformation efficiencies were strain dependent and varied from 10 to 10 transformants per mug of DNA. Plasmid DNA analysis of L. pentosus MD353 transformants revealed that the introduction of pLP3537 or pLPE323 was invariably accompanied by loss of the endogenous 2.3-kb plasmid. Remarkably, pLPE317 could only be introduced into an L. pentosus MD353 strain that had been previously cured of its endogenous 1.7-kb plasmid. The curing phenomena are most likely to be explained by the incompatibility of the vectors and resident plasmids. Lactobacillus vectors are generally rapidly lost when cells are cultivated in the absence of selective pressure. However, pLPE323 is stable in three of four Lactobacillus strains tested so far.
TI  - Performance and fecal flora of calves fed a Bacillus subtilis concentrate.
AB  - Eighty-four Holstein calves were assigned at 2 d of age to one of three treatments: 1) control with no additives; 2) 10 g of a mixed microbial concentrate containing Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus lactis, and Bacillus subtilis; or 3) 10 g of a B. subtilis concentrate. The microbial concentrates were mixed with milk replacer during the a.m. feeding. The milk replacer was offered twice daily at 5% BW per feeding; the reconstituted replacer contained 12.5% DM. Volume of replacer fed was based on initial weight of calf and held constant until weaning. Water and starter ration were offered for ad libitum intake throughout the trial. Calves were weaned abruptly at 30 d of age and received only water and starter from d 31 to 44. General health and performance of all calves were good. Although differences in weight gain and feed efficiency were not significant, the B. subtilis concentrate tended to have a positive effect on feed efficiency during wk 1 to 4 and on immediate postweaning gain. A higher fecal bacilli count at 6 wk in calves fed the microbial concentrates may be related to their tendency for improved gain during d 31 to 44, the immediate postweaning period.
TI  - Establishment of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species in germfree mice and their influence on some microflora-associated characteristics.
AB  - Germfree mice were inoculated with both Lactobacillus acidophilus A10 and Bifidobacterium bifidum B11. Both strains were established and present in more than 10(8) cells per g of cecum and colon contents. Furthermore, L. acidophilus A10 was established in high numbers in stomach and small intestine. Contents from different parts of the intestine were investigated with regard to the following microflora-associated characteristics: degradation of mucin, beta-aspartylglycine and tryptic activity, conversion of cholesterol to coprostanol and bilirubin to urobilinogen, deconjugation of bilirubin glucuronides, and reduction of the cecum size. In spite of being established, the microbes were not able to mediate any alterations of the parameters investigated. All animals retained values as found in their germfree counterparts.
TI  - What about NFP? Unknown risks.
AB  
TI  - Binding of mutagens by fractions of the cell wall skeleton of lactic acid bacteria on mutagens.
AB  - The binding effect of cells and cell fractions, cell wall skeleton, cytoplasm, whole cells, and cell wall skeleton treated by lysozyme and alpha-amylase at 37 degrees C for 5 h, on Trp-P-1 (3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-[5H]pyrido [4,3-b]indole) and Trp-P-2 (3-amino-1-methyl-[5H]-pyrido[4,3-b]indole) were investigated. The cell and cell wall skeleton of Streptococcus cremoris Z-25 had greater binding activity, but cytoplasm and extract of cell wall skeleton did not bind Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2. When the cells or cell wall skeleton were treated with lysozyme and alpha-amylase, unbound Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 concentrations were greater than that of the untreated control. It is possible that cell walls may be involved in the binding of mutagenic pyrolyzates to lactic acid bacteria. The cell wall skeleton of S. cremoris Z-25, Lactobacillus acidophilus IFO 13951, and Bifidobacterium bifidum IFO 14252 showed binding of Trp-P-1, 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido(1,2-a:3',2'- d)imidazole, 2-amino-5-phenylpyridine, 2-amino-3-methylimidazo(4,5-f)quinoline, 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo(4,5-f) quinoline, and 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo(4,5-f)quinoxaline. The cell wall skeleton of S. cremoris group and Streptococcus lactis also showed the binding activity with A N-nitrosodimethylamine. The binding of Trp-P-1 to cell walls was very high, and the binding of mutagenic pyrolyzates was variable with different bacterial species. The peptidoglycan complex and polysaccharides liberated from cell wall skeleton of S. cremoris Z-25 showed strong binding of Trp-P-2. Peptidoglycans has a binding effect of about 19.86 micrograms/mg; polysaccharides had a binding effect of 14 micrograms/mg.
TI  - Population of Salmonella serovar typhimurium in the cecum of gnotobiotic chickens with Escherichia coli and intestinal bacteria.
AB  - To test the interaction between various species of bacteria and Salmonella serovar typhimurium (S. typhimurium), the population of S. typhimurium was measured in the cecum of gnotobiotic chickens in the presence of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and one of the four intestinal bacteria; Lactobacillus acidophilus. Clostridium perfringens, Bifidobacterium thermophilum and Bacteroides vulgatus. Competitive exclusion of S. typhimurium by di-flora chicken was not demonstrated. But the population of S. typhimurium was temporarily suppressed in di-flora chickens with E. coli and L. acidophilus. In penta-flora chickens with E. coli and these four intestinal bacteria, the population of S. typhimurium was suppressed for only 2 days. In normalized chickens, the population of S. typhimurium was markedly suppressed.
TI  - Relationship between bile tolerance and the presence of a ruthenium red staining  layer on strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Seventeen strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus were evaluated to determine the relationship between bile tolerance and the presence of an outer polysaccharide layer exterior to the cell wall when viewed by transmission electron microscopy. Bile tolerance is necessary for survival of lactobacilli in the intestinal tract, and the polysaccharide layer may be responsible for adherence to human intestinal tissue. These two factors may be the basis for use of L. acidophilus as a dietary adjunct. Ten strains exhibited a ruthenium red-stained outer polysaccharide layer. Three of the 10 strains had extremely dense layers, which may indicate stronger adherence properties. Seven strains did not contain a ruthenium red-stained outer layer; however, six strains that did not have the stained layer were resistant to 1.0% bile concentration. Fourteen strains were tolerant to 1% bile, one strain was tolerant to 6% bile, and two strains were sensitive to bile. No relationship between bile tolerance and the presence of the ruthenium red-stained outer polysaccharide layer was apparent.
TI  - [Oral bacterial therapy in prevention of antibiotic-induced diarrhea in childhood].
AB  - Amoxycillin is currently the most widely used antibiotic in pediatrics. It is known that this antibiotic, as well as other kinds of antimicrobial treatments, may produce variations in the bowel ecosystem. A controlled randomised clinical trial was performed using commercially available fermented milk products in infants who had received an oral treatment with amoxycillin for an average of ten days. 40 children have been examined, randomly divided into two groups of twenty. Group 1 received treatment with antibiotic plus lactobacilli. Group 2 received only amoxycillin. At the end of the trial infants of group 1 showed a lower frequency of stool passages and more fully-formed feces, while patients of group 2 presented an increased frequency of gastrointestinal disorders. On the basis of the results obtained it is possible to conclude that oral bacterial therapy with lactobacilli is efficacious in preventing diarrhea from amoxycillin in infancy.
TI  - In vitro binding of mutagenic pyrolyzates to lactic acid bacterial cells in human gastric juice.
AB  - The binding of mutagenic pyrolyzates to freeze-dried cells of Streptococcus cremoris Z-25 was investigated in human gastric juice and compared with the ability of these pyrolyzates to bind in distilled water (pH 6.30). The pH of donated gastric juice ranged from 1.2 to 7.8. Binding that occurred in gastric juice was pH dependent, and binding was affected by NaCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2. Les sof Trp-P-2 was bound in gastric juice at low pH (1.2, 1.48, and 2.1) than at pH 4 to 8. The strain bound simultaneously Trp-P-1, Trp-P-2, and Glu-P-1. The maximum amounts of Trp-P-2 bound to S. cremoris Z-25 were approximately 47.50 micrograms/mg of cells. Freeze-dried cells treated at 120 degrees C for 15 min or 80 degrees C for 3 h showed increased binding of Trp-P-2. However, binding decreased 10% after heating at 120 degrees C for 15 min. Cells nonthermally killed by gastric juice (pH 1.5) had the same Trp-P-2 binding capacity as viable cells. Lactobacillus acidophilus IFO 13951 and Bifidobacterium bifidum IFO 14252 representation of the intestinal bacteria nonthermally killed by gastric juice also showed larger binding of Trp-P-2.
TI  - Cloning, phenotypic expression, and DNA sequence of the gene for lactacin F, an antimicrobial peptide produced by Lactobacillus spp.
AB  - Lactacin F is a heat-stable bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus 11088. A 63-mer oligonucleotide probe deduced from the N-terminal lactacin F amino acid sequence was used to clone the putative laf structural gene from plasmid DNA of a lactacin F-producing transconjugant, L. acidophilus T143. One clone, NCK360, harbored a recombinant plasmid, pTRK160, which contained a 2.2-kb EcoRI fragment of the size expected from hybridization experiments. An Escherichia coli-L. acidophilus shuttle vector was constructed, and a subclone (pTRK162) containing the 2.2-kb EcoRI fragment was introduced by electroporation into two lactacin F-negative strains, L. acidophilus 89 and 88-C. Lactobacillus transformants containing pTRK162 expressed lactacin F activity and immunity. Bacteriocin produced by the transformants exhibited an inhibitory spectrum and heat stability identical to those of the wild-type bacteriocin. An 873-bp region of the 2.2-kb fragment was sequenced by using a 20-mer degenerate lactacin F-specific primer to initiate sequencing from within the lactacin F structural gene. Analysis of the resulting sequence identified an open reading frame which could encode a protein of 75 amino acids. The 25 N-terminal amino acids for lactacin F were identified within the open reading frame along with an N-terminal extension, possibly a signal sequence. The lactacin F N-terminal sequence, through the remainder of the open reading frame (57 amino acids; 6.3 kDa), correlated extremely well with composition analyses of purified lactacin F which also predicted a size of 51 to 56 amino acid residues. Molecular characterization of lactacin F identified a small hydrophobic peptide that may be representative of a common bacteriocin class in lactic acid bacteria.

TI  - Ecology of accelerated natural lactic fermentation of sorghum-based infant food formulas.
AB  - Accelerated natural lactic fermentation of mixed sorghum-cowpea (Formula 1) and sorghum-milkpowder (Formula 2) infant food formulas was achieved by repetitive (60 fermentation cycles of 24 h each) use of the previous batch as an inoculum at a rate of 10% (w/w) and resulted in a gradual establishment of mixed populations of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts. In Formula 1, early fermentation stages (fermentation cycles 1-4) were dominated by Leuconostoc and Lactococcus spp. which caused conditions inhibitive to yeasts. Probably due to micronutrient deficiencies, the former lactic acid bacteria were succeeded by a combination of Lactobacillus plantarum and Candida spp. achieving pH values 4.2-4.3. In formula 2, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus brevis consistently achieved pH 3.7-3.8, thereby allowing only a minority of yeasts, mainly Candida and Trichosporon spp. None of the isolated yeasts exhibited 'killer'-activity.
TI  - [The degradation of vicine and convicine in field bean meal by selected bacterial strains].
AB  - Vicine and convicine as natural occurring toxic compounds in Vicia faba are involved in the formation of hemolytic anemia (favism). Removal of these compounds needs high technological expense. Microbiological degradation with different strains of bacteria was tried. After 3 h incubation with Streptococcus faeciens convicine was converted completely and Vicine to about 95%.
TI  - [Local administration of low-dose estriol and vital Lactobacillus acidophilus in  postmenopause].
AB  - A randomized double-blind trial with 15 postmenopausal women led to a remarkable  result. Local treatment with vaginal tablets just containing 0.03 mg estriol proved to be equivalent to the widely used dosage of 0.5 mg. The test drug Gynoflor E induced significant proliferation of the vaginal epithelium and thus offers the basis for a complete restoration of the vaginal environment. Simultaneously given Lactobacillus acidophilus can be implanted successfully and thus an acid vaginal milieu can be restored.
TI  - Effect of lactic acid producing bacteria on the human intestinal microflora during ampicillin treatment.
AB  - 20 healthy volunteers participated in a double blind study concerning the effect  of lactic acid producing bacteria on the intestinal microflora during ampicillin treatment. 10 volunteers received 500 mg ampicillin tablets t.i.d. together with capsules containing lactic acid producing bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum) for 7 days, and the other 10 volunteers were given 500 mg ampicillin tablets together with placebo capsules t.i.d. for 7 days. Both groups of volunteers continued the intake of the capsules t.i.d. for another 14 days after the ampicillin administration had been completed. The number of enterococci, streptococci and corynebacteria decreased during ampicillin administration but returned to normal levels after 14 days. Yeasts increased during the antibiotic treatment but returned to the same levels as before treatment within 14 days. Escherichia coli strains were suppressed in most volunteers during ampicillin administration. The numbers of anaerobic gram-positive cocci and rods decreased in most subjects during ampicillin treatment but were normalized within 2 weeks. Bacteroides strains were recovered in higher numbers in the lactic acid producing bacteria group compared to the placebo group. The volunteers receiving lactic acid producing bacteria were recolonized slightly faster than those having placebo. There were adverse effects observed in 3 subjects receiving ampicillin plus placebo. In the lactic acid producing bacteria group, one subject had diarrhoea on day 3 to on day 3 to day 7.

TI  - Purification and partial characterization of lactacin F, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus 11088.
AB  - Lactacin F, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus 11088 (NCK88), was purified and characterized. Lactacin F is heat stable, proteinaceous, and inhibitory to other lactobacilli as well as Enterococcus faecalis. The bacteriocin was isolated as a floating pellet from culture supernatants brought to 35 to 40% saturation with ammonium sulfate. Native lactacin F was sized at approximately 180 kDa by gel filtration. Column fractions having lactacin F activity were examined by electron microscopy and contained micelle-like globular particles. Purification by ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration, and high-performance liquid chromatography resulted in a 474-fold increase in specific activity of lactacin F. The purified bacteriocin was identified as a 2.5-kDa peptide by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The lactacin F peptide retained activity after extraction from SDS-PAGE gel slices, confirming the identity of the 2.5-kDa peptide. Variants of NCK88 that failed to exhibit lactacin F activity did not produce the 2.5-kDa band. Sequence analysis of purified lactacin F identified 25 N-terminal amino acids containing an arginine residue at the N terminus. Composition analysis indicates that lactacin F may contain as many as 56 amino acid residues.
TI  - Influence of nonfermented dairy products containing bacterial starter cultures on lactose maldigestion in humans.
AB  - The effect of nonfermented dairy products containing yogurt or acidophilus cultures on lactose utilization by lactose-maldigesting humans was investigated. Yogurt and acidophilus milk containing 10(7) or 10(8) of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus, or Lactobacillus acidophilus, respectively, were prepared using commercially processed 2% low fat milk. Immediately following inoculation, products were refrigerated. Lactose maldigestion was monitored by measuring breath hydrogen excretion at hourly intervals for 8 h following consumption of 400 ml of each test meal containing approximately 20 g of lactose. The yogurt milk containing 10(8) cfu/ml was shown to contain significant concentrations of microbial beta-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23; approximately 3 U/ml), which remained stable for at least 14 d at refrigerator temperatures. Breath hydrogen peaks were delayed and significantly lower (approximately 20 ppm at 5 to 7 h) than control values (approximately 70 ppm at 4 h), and intolerance symptoms were eliminated in all subjects. Yogurt milk containing 10(7) cfu/ml demonstrated intermediate breath hydrogen values and was marginally significantly different from control values. Lactobacillus acidophilus strains with varying resistance to bile and total beta-galactosidase-producing potential were also tested. Only one strain, LA-1, which demonstrated low bile resistance and intermediate beta-galactosidase activity, was capable of significantly decreasing breath hydrogen values when 10(8) cfu/ml of milk was consumed.
TI  - Influence of bacteria on Clostridium perfringens infections in young chickens.
AB  - When monoflora chickens with Lactobacillus acidophilus or Streptococcus faecalis  were inoculated with Clostridium perfringens either in broth culture or resuspended in Gifu anaerobic medium broth or supernatant fluid, few or no chickens died. Approximately 50% of germ-free chickens died after inoculation of C. perfringens culture, whereas no conventional birds died after inoculation of broth culture. C. perfringens in the contents of duodenum from germ-free chickens numbered about 10(4) colony-forming units (CFU)/g after inoculation 10(8) CFU broth culture per bird, but in gnotobiotic and conventional chickens this organism decreased or was not detected. When C. perfringens was cultured in intestinal contents collected from germ-free chickens, C. perfringens proliferated but alpha toxin was not detected. These findings indicate that the pathogenicity of C. perfringens was suppressed by L. acidophilus or S. faecalis administered previously or inhibited by normal intestinal flora.
TI  - Lactobacillus septicemia, an unusual complication during the treatment of metastatic choriocarcinoma.
AB  - A case of severe Lactobacillus septicemia in a patient treated with chemotherapy  because of metastatic choriocarcinoma is described. Although Lactobacillus is a ubiquitous commensal of the female genital tract, no earlier reference was found in the literature.

TI  - [Vaccination against nonspecific bacterial vaginosis. Double-blind study of Gynatren].
AB  - 167 patients suffering from nonspecific bacterial vaginoses were vaccinated in a  double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. It appeared, during the study period of 14 months, that the vaccination with Gynatren, a lactobacillus vaccine, was significantly better than the placebo as concerns its therapeutical effect, but mainly as concerns its preventive effect (less reinfections). The vaccine was very well tolerated. We conclude that vaccination with Gynatren is an effective measure to prevent recurrences of nonspecific vaginosis.
TI  - Cloning, expression, and nucleotide sequence of the Lactobacillus helveticus 481  gene encoding the bacteriocin helveticin J.
AB  - Lactobacillus helveticus 481 produces a 37-kDa bacteriocin called helveticin J. Libraries of chromosomal DNA from L. helveticus were prepared in lambda gt11 and probed for phage-producing fusion proteins that could react with polyclonal helveticin J antibody. Two recombinant phage, HJ1 and HJ4, containing homologous inserts of 350 and 600 bp, respectively, produced proteins that reacted with antibody. These two phage clones specifically hybridized to L. helveticus 481 total genomic DNA but not to DNA from strains that did not produce helveticin J or strains producing unrelated bacteriocins. HJ1 and HJ4 lysogens produced beta-galactosidase fusion proteins that shared similar epitopes with each other and helveticin J. The intact helveticin J gene (hlv) was isolated by screening a library of L. helveticus chromosomal DNA in lambda EMBL3 with the insert DNA from phage HJ4 as a probe. The DNA sequence of a contiguous 3,364-bp region was determined. Two complete open reading frames (ORF), designated ORF2 and ORF3, were identified within the sequenced fragment. The 3' end of another open reading frame, ORF1, was located upstream of ORF2. A noncoding region and a putative promoter were located between ORF1 and ORF2. ORF2 could encode an 11,808-Da protein. The L. helveticus DNA inserts of the HJ1 and HJ4 clones reside within ORF3, which begins 30 bp downstream from the termination codon of ORF2. ORF3 could encode a 37,511-Da protein. Downstream from ORF3, the 5' end of another ORF (ORF4) was found. A Bg/II fragment containing ORF2 and ORF3 was cloned into pGK12, and the recombinant plasmid, pTRK135, was transformed into Lactobacillus acidophilus via electroporation. Transformants carrying pTRK135 produced a bacteriocin that was heat labile and exhibited an acitivity spectrum that was the same as that of helveticin J.
TI  - [The effect of a preparation made from Solco lactobacteria on the survival rate and intestinal microflora of irradiated animals].
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus strain Lat 11/83 Solco has been used for the normalization of intestinal microflora in experimental post-irradiation intestinal dysbacteriosis in mice. The results of these experiments indicate that live Solco lactobacteria, introduced intragastrically, facilitate the enhancement of the survival rate of irradiated animals and the normalization of microflora in their gastrointestinal tract. The strain can be used as bacterial preparation for the regulation of intestinal microbiocenosis.
TI  - Studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  - Two unique forms of periodontal disease, HIV-gingivitis and HIV-periodontitis, have been described in patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). In order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in AIDS patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 AIDS patients with periodontitis. The presence of putative periodontal pathogens including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides intermedius, Porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly B. gingivalis), and Wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 AIDS patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. Of 666 bacterial strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, Streptococcus sanguis II was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by Lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (12%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), Actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and Actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). Fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. Enteric species including Enterococcus avium and Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium clostridiiforme and Clostridium difficle as well as Klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. Immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of A. actinomycetemcomitans, B. intermedius, and P. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four times more periodontitis patients demonstrated W. recta. Subgingival yeast was a frequent finding in these AIDS patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. This study indicates that subgingival plaque in AIDS patients with periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-HIV infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.
TI  - Is there a role for lactobacilli in prevention of urogenital and intestinal infections?
AB  - This review describes the importance of microbial adhesion in the ecology of the  urogenital and intestinal tracts and the influence of host and microbial factors in bacterial interference. In a recent revival of interest in bacterial interference, lactobacillus administration has been studied as a means of treating and preventing disease. Although evidence is conflicting, Lactobacillus acidophilus appears to be involved in beneficial antagonistic and cooperative reactions that interfere with establishment of pathogens in the gastrointestinal tract. The mechanisms of action are believed to involve competitive exclusion and production of inhibitory substances, including bacteriocins. These characteristics, as well as demonstrated adherence abilities in vitro, led to selection of certain Lactobacillus strains for clinical studies of cystitis. Weekly intravaginal Lactobacillus therapy reduced the recurrence rate of uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections in women. Use of Lactobacillus strains resistant to Nonoxynol-9, a spermicide that kills members of the protective normal vaginal flora, may have potential for use in women with recurrent cystitis using this contraceptive agent. In veterinary studies, bacterial interference by administration of probiotics has also been beneficial in disease prevention in animals. Carefully selected bacterial mixtures integrate with the gastrointestinal flora of the animals and can confer disease resistance and improve physiological function. Additional human and animal trials are needed to determine the practical, long-term usefulness of bacterial interference as a protective mechanism against infectious diseases.
TI  - Influence of whey and probiotic-supplemented withdrawal feed on the retention of  Salmonella intubated into market age broilers.
AB  - Broilers (6 wk of age) were crop-intubated with a nalidixic acid-resistant strain of Salmonella typhimurium and given four withdrawal feeds: 1) control feed (corn and soybean meal base, 18% CP and 3,200 kcal ME/kg); 2) control plus 5% whey (61% lactose); 3) control plus probiotic (6.8 x 10(6) cfu of Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, Bifidobacterium thermophilium, and Lactobacillus acidophilus); and 4) control plus 5% whey plus probiotic. In Experiment 1, male broilers received 9.8 x 10(7) cfu of S. typhimurium per bird midway through a 20-h fast. The withdrawal feeds were continuously offered through a subsequent period of 6 to 7 days. Live performance of broilers during this time was similar among treatments. Ceca from birds consuming whey were significantly (P less than .05) increased in weight and distended with gas. Recovery of S. typhimurium from the ceca was low with all treatments, and the effects of whey or probiotic at reducing the organism could not be determined. In Experiment 2, female broilers received the same four experimental feeds for 48 h. Salmonella typhimurium was intubated 24 h after feed access (1.2 x 10(7) cfu per bird). Again, no differences (P greater than .05) in performance occurred, but the inclusion of whey led to increased cecal weight and size (P less than .05). Large numbers of S. typhimurium were recovered from the ceca 24 h after intubation, but the levels were similar among treatments. Whey and probiotic in the withdrawal feed did not appear to affect the Salmonella level in ceca when the organism was consumed prior to marketing.
TI  - Effects of microbial supplements containing yeast and lactobacilli on roughage-fed ruminal microbial activities.
AB  - Effects of two microbial feed supplements on microbial activities in rumen-stimulating cultures and the rumens of steers fed a fescue hay-based roughage diet were evaluated. The yeast culture supplement contained Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1.4 to 4.2 x 10(9) colony-forming units [cfu]/g), whereas the mixed microbial supplement contained yeast, lactobacilli and enterococci (1.4 to 2.7 x 10(9) cfu/g, 1.2 to 2.3 x 10(9) cfu/g, and 1.5 to 2.6 x 10(10) cfu/g, respectively). Concentrations of viable yeast cells were increased consistently in continuous cultures and rumens of steers receiving either supplement (1 g/kg of feed). However, neither supplement consistently altered the relative concentrations of volatile fatty acids or ammonia in continuous cultures and rumens of steers. The pH tended to be greater (P = .13) in continuous cultures receiving yeast culture supplement than in cultures receiving the unsupplemented diet (6.50 vs 6.36), but pH in the rumens of steers was not affected by the supplements. Concentrations of cellulolytic microorganisms in cultures and the rumens of steers receiving supplements containing only yeast were from 5 to 40 times greater than those observed in cultures or steers receiving the unsupplemented diet. Supplements that had been treated with heat (121 degrees C for 15 min) to inactive yeast cells did not alter the concentrations of cellulolytic bacteria in rumen-stimulating cultures. These results suggest that live yeast culture supplements stimulate growth of cellulolytic microorganisms in the rumen.
TI  - Effect of chronic ingestion of a fermented dairy product containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum on metabolic activities of the colonic flora in humans.
AB  - Nine healthy volunteers were studied before, during, and after ingesting a fermented dairy product containing Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and mesophilic cultures (Streptococcus lactis and S cremoris) for 3 wk. Hydrogen and methane productions and fecal beta-galactosidase and beta-glucosidase activities were measured as indicators of fermentation capacity of the colonic flora. Fecal concentrations of nitroreductase, azoreductase, and beta-glucuronidase, which may be implicated in colonic carcinogenesis, were also assessed. Hydrogen and methane productions, fecal beta-galactosidase, beta-glucuronidase, and azoreductase activities did not change over three 3-wk periods whereas fecal beta-glucosidase activity increased (42 +/- 6, 91 +/- 12, and 40 +/- 6 IU/g N, P less than 0.01) and nitroreductase decreased (0.87 +/- 0.13, 0.54 +/- 0.11, and 0.57 +/- 0.08 IU/g N, P less than 0.05).
TI  - [Immunobiologic properties of lactobacilli].
AB  - The authors investigated in experiments on mice immunobiological properties of selected strains of lactobacilli (Lbc. acidophilus, Lbc. casei and Lbc. delbruecki). Their immunostimulating action was evaluated from the migrating capacity of lymphocytes into the interepithelial spaces and lamina propria mucosae of the gut. The most marked changes were observed in the group of animals to whom Lbc. acidophilus and Lbc. casei was administered for two weeks by a gastric tube. The protective properties of lactobacilli on the course and development of model infections (virus of encephalomyocarditis) was greatest in mice given Lbc. casei and Lbc. acidophilus by the intraperitoneal route four days before infection. At the end of the two-week period in the Lbc. casei group 66% mice survived and in the Lbc. acidophilus group 34%. The ability of lactobacilli to influence the interferon producing activity was investigated in vitro on a model of peritoneal cells obtained from premedicated mice. The lactobacilli strains themselves did not have interferon inducing properties. However, when the interferon producing capacity of peritoneal cells was assessed after administration of the viral inducer (virus of Newcastle disease) the capacity was much higher, when compared with controls.

AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus strain Lat 11/83 has been used for the study of its antagonistic activity with respect to pathogenic microorganisms in experiments on conventional germ-free animals. The results of these experiments indicate that the above strain may be recommended as a highly active antagonist for the treatment and prophylaxis of intestinal dysbacteriosis of different etiology.

AB  - The authors studied the ability of a live polymicrobial formulation containing Lactobacillus acidophilus 10(9) and Bifidobacterium bifidum 10(9) to act as an "ecological" therapy for gastritis and duodenitis. The study was carried out in volunteers suffering from these disorders which nowadays are attributed to C. pylori. The results obtained confirm previous findings in experimental animals. The polymicrobial formulation was found to be able to compete effectively with the microorganism responsible for the disorders and to improve the results obtained by traditional therapy.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of orthodontic band cements].
AB  - The prevalence of enamel decalcification and caries beneath orthodontic bands, has indicated the need for a new enamel binding adhesive orthodontic cement. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity, in vitro, on Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus, acidophillus, of three materials used to cements the orthodontic bands. The cements studied were: Zinc phosphate cement, Glass-ionomer cement, and Policarboxylate cement. Thirty petri plates were seeded with S. mutans, and thirty with L. acidophillus; on each plate three pellet were placed, one of each cement studied. Petri plates were incubated under microaerophilic conditions at 37 C, and checked at 72 hrs. for Streptococcus, mutans, and four days for Lactobacillus acidophillus to evaluate the inhibition zone. The results were tabulated for each material. It was demonstrated that exists important variations in the antimicrobial properties of the materials studied, as in the microbial sensitivity to these cements.
TI  - [The effect of "Solco" lactobacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus) on the survival  and microflora of mice with a Salmonella infection].
AB  - The Solco lactobacterial strain L. acidophilus Lat 11/83 has been used for the normalization of intestinal microflora in experimental post-infectious intestinal dysbacteriosis in mice. The results of experiments indicate that the intragastric administration of live Solco lactobacteria contributes to an increase in the survival rate of infected animals and the normalization of their gastrointestinal microflora. This strain may be used as a bacterial preparation for the regulation of intestinal microbiocenosis.
TI  - [Analysis of the in vitro antibacterial action of a fluoridated amalgam].
AB  - To a conventional silver amalgam alloy was added 1% of stanous fluoride, to prove in vitro, if it presents any antibacteria actions against S. mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Thirteen Petri plate were seeded with S. mutans and 12 Petri plate with Lactobacillus, in both cases, was disposited fluoride containing amalgam and conventional amalgam. The average of inhibition signs in the Petri plates with S. mutans was 1.7 mm in the Petri plates with Lactobacillus the average was 2.4 mm. Is demonstrated that the fluoride containing amalgam has in vitro antibacteria action in comparison with conventional amalgam, that has none.
TI  - Prevention of gastrointestinal infection using immunobiological methods with milk fermented with Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - The protective effect of feeding milk fermented with a mixture of Lactobacillus casei sp. and Lb. acidophilus sp. against Salmonella typhimurium infection in mice was compared with that obtained feeding milks fermented with these microorganisms individually. The survival rate obtained after oral infection with Sal. typhimurium was 100% in mice pretreated by feeding during 8 d with the mixture of Lb. casei and Lb. acidophilus fermented milks. Similar treatments with the individual milks were ineffective. Moreover, mice became more susceptible to infection with Sal. typhimurium after such treatment. The colonization of liver and spleen with the pathogen was markedly inhibited by the pretreatment with the mixture of fermented milk, while such inhibition was not observed using the Lb. casei and Lb. acidophilus milks. The highest levels of anti-salmonellae antibodies in serum and in intestinal fluid were found in the group of mice fed with the mixture and with Lb. casei fermented milk respectively. However, this latter milk was not effective in protecting against Sal. typhimurium. When the mice were first infected with Sal. typhimurium and then fed with the mixture of fermented milks, pathogen colonization was not prevented. The results suggest that the augmentation of resistance to salmonellae caused by the treatment with Lb. casei- + Lb. acidophilus-fermented milk was due to the anti-salmonellae protective immunity mainly mediated by the mucosal tissue. Milk fermented with this mixture could be used as an immunobiological method to prevent gastrointestinal infection.
TI  - Factors to consider when selecting a culture of Lactobacillus acidophilus as a dietary adjunct to produce a hypocholesterolemic effect in humans.
AB  - Significant variations in bile tolerance and ability to assimilate cholesterol were observed among 12 cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus of human origin. The degree of bile tolerance as measured by rapidity of growth in MRS broth supplemented with .3% oxgall could not be predicted by the rapidity of growth in the broth without oxgall. There was no apparent direct relationship between bile tolerance and cholesterol assimilation. However, among the cultures that most actively assimilated cholesterol, there were significant differences in bile tolerance. The most active cholesterol-assimilating cultures also varied in the ability to produce bacteriocins. A culture of L. acidophilus of human origin, which assimilates cholesterol, grows well in presence of bile, and produces bacteriocins can be selected for use as a dietary adjunct for humans. A culture of L. acidophilus possessing all these characteristics should have an advantage over one that does not in establishing and functioning in the intestinal tract to assimilate cholesterol.
TI  - A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy of Lactinex in the prophylaxis of amoxicillin-induced diarrhea.
AB  - The disruption of the natural flora of the gastrointestinal tract (especially Lactobacillus acidophilus) may occur during antibiotic therapy. This may lead to diarrhea, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances. It has been suggested that replacement of the lactobacilli with a commercially available product may prevent the diarrhea. The efficacy and safety of prophylactically administered Lactinex (culture of L. acidophilus and L. bulgaricus) was compared with placebo for the prevention of amoxicillin-induced diarrhea in pediatric patients. Lactinex or placebo was administered four times a day for ten days to coincide with the antibiotic therapy. The Lactobacillus preparation did not appear to consistently prevent diarrhea in this patient population. Patients' age, diet, and parental definition of diarrhea were factors that may have influenced the results.
TI  - Microbiologic characteristics of Lactobacillus products used for colonization of  the vagina.
AB  - Lactobacilli have long been considered to be the protective flora in the vagina.  Women with vaginal infections have used various non-prescription products in an attempt to restore their normal vaginal flora. Products that contain lactobacilli include dairy products (yogurt, acidophilus milk) and commercially available Lactobacillus powders and tablets. Recently, Lactobacillus species that produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) have been associated with normal vaginal flora. In this study, we compared 16 non-prescription products containing lactobacilli for H2O2 production, purity, and identifiable contaminants. All 16 products contained lactobacilli, of which ten (62%) produced H2O2. At least one contaminant was detected in 11 of 16 (69%) of the products: Enterococcus faecium (ten), Clostridium sporogenes (one), Streptococcus mitis (one), and Pseudomonas species (one). Although all of the products tested contained lactobacilli, only four of the products contained Lactobacillus acidophilus. Most of the lactobacilli-containing products currently available either do not contain the Lactobacillus species advertised and/or contain other bacteria of questionable benefit. We conclude that commercially available products may not be appropriate for recolonization of the vagina.
TI  - [Penicillin-binding proteins of various strains of Lactobacillus].
AB  - Sensitivity of different species of Lactobacillus i.e. L. casei, L. plantarum, L. acidophillus, L. buchneri, L. jugurti and others to penicillins and cephalosporins of various generations was studied. Penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) of the Lactobacillus species were specified. It was shown that the number of PBPs depended on the Lactobacillus species. L. casei had the least number of PBPs (4) and L. brevis had the highest number of PBPs (11). Competition of 14C-benzylpenicillin with ampicillin, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime and cefoperazone for binding to separate PBPs in three strains of different Lactobacillus species was investigated.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria and human health.
AB  - Although claims for health and nutritional benefits have been made for lactic acid bacteria in fermented dairy products for nearly a century, the nutritional and therapeutic value of these organisms is still controversial. This article will review the scientific basis of these claims. There are numerous studies showing fermentation of food with lactobacilli increase the quantity, availability, digestibility, and assimilability of nutrients. The basis for this conclusion comes from direct measurements of vitamin synthesis and from increased feed efficiency when fermented products are fed to animals. There have been a number of studies showing that various fermented dairy products lower serum cholesterol levels in humans and animals. These studies are reviewed and the validity of these findings are assessed. A summary of the evidence indicating that lactase deficient individuals can eat yogurt and the mechanisms involved in this toleration is reviewed. The role of fermented dairy products in inhibiting tumor growth and chemically induced tumors in animals is discussed and the possible mechanisms involved in this protective effect are reviewed. Fermented dairy products and lypholized lactobacilli preparations have been shown to be useful in treating and preventing various intestinal infections including; salmonellosis, shigellosis and antibiotic induced diarrhea. In this context a specific lactobacillus designated GG has been shown to be useful in treating recurring diarrhea caused by a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile.
TI  - Utilization of sugars by Lactobacillus acidophilus strains.
AB  - Utilization of various carbohydrates viz., glucose, fructose, sucrose, lactose and galactose by Lactobacillus acidophilus strains was investigated in Lactobacillus Selection Broth. Maximum viable counts, acid production and sugar utilization by different test strains were in the order: glucose greater than or equal to fructose greater than sucrose greater than or equal to lactose greater than galactose. The generation time of the tested strains was shorter in glucose medium as compared to sucrose or lactose medium.
TI  - Evidence for the involvement of thiocyanate in the inhibition of Candida albicans by Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus has been found to inhibit Candida albicans when grown on MRS agar plates. Attempts to isolate an active factor responsible for this inhibition from liquid culture and agar plates were not successful. The addition of sodium thiocyanate to the agar was found to increase the inhibition offered by the lactobacillus. The results indicate that hydrogen peroxide produced by the lactobacillus is being used to convert the thiocyanate to hypothiocyanate which is more toxic. The involvement of a lactobacillus peroxidase in this conversion is postulated.
TI  - Exclusion of uropathogen adhesion to polymer surfaces by Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - The ability of bacteria to adhere to surfaces is a major cause of concern in the  use of biomaterial substrates. The adhesion of Staphylococcus epidermidis strain 1938 was examined using image analysis and was found not to correlate with polymer surface tension, unlike that of Lactobacillus acidophilus, which adhered to more hydrophobic polymers. A fimbriated uropathogenic E. coli strain showed very low levels of adherence to the biomaterials. Precoating the polymers with lactobacilli significantly reduced the staphylococcal and E. coli adhesion, a result which could have clinical significance. An additional finding was that the interaction of staphylococci and E. coli with lactobacilli coated polymers altered the adhesion profile of the latter. Lactobacilli appeared to detach from polymers of low surface tension and reattach to polymers with high surface tensions. This resulted in the highest levels of exclusion of uropathogens being found for lactobacilli-coated glass and sulfonated polystyrene, both of which are hydrophilic (with high surface tensions). These results demonstrate that lactobacilli can be used to coat biomaterial surfaces leading to a reduced adhesion of uropathogens.
TI  - Treatment failure in trichomoniasis and persistence of the parasite after Lactobacillus immunotherapy; two case reports.
AB  - This report describes the clinical and laboratory observations on two patients with a Trichomonas vaginalis infection resistant to metronidazole. The metronidazole resistance was confirmed in in vitro cultures under aerobic conditions, after in vitro cultivation of the strains. Trichomonas infection persisted during high-dose intravenous metronidazole administration and Lactobacillus immunotherapy was unsuccessful in both patients.
TI  - [Oral bacteriotherapy with Bifidobacterium bifidum and Lactobacillus acidophilus  in cirrhotic patients].
AB  - Thirty-five patients with alcohol cirrhosis were treated for several months (average 4 months) with Infloran (6 capsules daily). Thirty cirrhotics were treated for the same length of time with lactulose and diuretics. Infloran-treated patients showed reduced ammonium levels, improvement of mental status and psychological performance. In addition, patients who required hospitalization had shorter in-patient periods thanks to a more rapid psychological and physical improvement. Infloran may be considered a valid alternative to conventional therapy for the out-patient management of subjects with alcoholic cirrhosis.
TI  - Superoxide dismutase activity in some strains of lactobacilli: induction by manganese.
AB  - Dialyzed cell-free extract of lactobacilli was found to contain superoxide dismutase activity by using a test system in which superoxide ion is generated by xanthine oxidase. The specific activities of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356, Lactobacillus murinus ATCC 35020, Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 358, Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC 8014, Lactobacillus casei CRL 431, Lactobacillus plantarum CRL 353, Lactobacillus fermentum ATCC 9338, Lactobacillus buchneri NCDO 110, and Lactobacillus fermentum CRL 251 were between 0.06 and 0.43 U/mg protein. The presence of superoxide dismutase activity was demonstrated when the strains were grown in media containing Mn2+ ions. Superoxide dismutase of lactobacilli may be an Mn enzyme since it was not inhibited by either cyanide or azide ions. However, the cell-free extract of Lactobacillus murinus ATCC 35020 contains superoxide dismutase activity sensitive to both ions.
TI  - Lactobacillus effects on cholesterol: in vitro and in vivo results.
AB  - A double blind investigation was conducted on the influence of a commercially available tablet containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus (Lactinex Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, MD) on human serum lipoprotein concentrations. Tablets containing about 2 X 10(6) viable bacteria of Lactobacillus mixtures or placebo tablets were ingested by 354 nonfasting informed subjects in a dose of one tablet each, taken four times a day. There was a 3-wk washout period between two 6-wk treatment periods. The number of viable lactobacillus in unused returned tablets was the same at the end of the study as in the beginning. Analysis of paired data using Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed no major effects on lipoprotein concentrations for either the placebo-treated group or the lactobacilli-treated group. There were no statistically significant differences for low density lipoprotein concentrations between the lactobacilli-treated group and the placebo-treated group. The high density lipoprotein concentrations increased 1.8 to 3.0 mg/dl in both groups for both study periods. For total cholesterol the placebo-treated group experienced a statistically significant increase in the first period according to the Wilcoxon signed ranks test (from 208.0 to 215.0 mg/dl, P less than .001) but not according to a two-sample Student t test. Total cholesterol did not change significantly for the Lactobacillus-treated group in either period. Cardiac risk factor (ratio of total cholesterol to high density cholesterol) did not vary during the study. Lipoprotein values increased immediately following vigorous exercise compared with following 15 min of resting without either placebo or treatment. Sample controls for assay and reassay gave virtually identical values (coefficient of variation 1.6%), confirming that assay results were quite reliable. Thus, ingestion of commercially available Lactobacillus tablets, which contain about 2 X 10(6) cfu/tablet of L. acidophilus and L. bulgaricus cells in a dose of four tablets daily did not affect serum lipoprotein concentrations.
TI  - Acidophilus milk products: a review of potential benefits to consumers.
AB  - During the past 80 yr considerable attention has been sporadically directed on benefits derived from consumption of milk products containing Lactobacillus acidophilus. Most earlier work dealt with the use of fermented acidophilus milk to treat intestinal infections. More recent studies have focused on other aspects of health or nutritional benefits that might be derived from this organism. These studies have shown that consumption of milk products containing L. acidophilus has the potential for: 1) preventing or controlling intestinal infections, 2) improving lactose digestion in persons classified as lactose maldigestors, 3) helping control serum cholesterol levels, and 4) exerting anticarcinogenic activity. Based on newer knowledge of L. acidophilus, a single strain of the organism probably will not produce all these benefits at optimal levels. Careful selection of specific strains of L. acidophilus combined with proper production and handling procedures will be necessary to ensure that desired benefits are provided to consumers.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus inhibits growth of Campylobacter pylori in vitro.
AB  - Campylobacter pylori has been implicated as a causative factor in acid-peptic disease. Lactobacillus acidophilus is known to inhibit the growth of pathogens in the human gastrointestinal tract. We recovered C. pylori from gastric antral biopsies of seven patients with acid-peptic disease; the isolates were then cultured in brucella broth. The effect of L. acidophilus (cultured in DeMan-Rogosa-Sharpe broth) on the growth of C. pylori was tested by a mixed culture technique. L. acidophilus inhibited the growth of all seven isolates of C. pylori in vitro. All these isolates were also inhibited by the L. acidophilus culture supernatant (brucella blood agar cup technique) obtained at or after 48 h of incubation. Inhibition of C. pylori growth was also observed with 1 and 3% lactic acid but not with 0.5 and 1% hydrogen peroxide, the L. acidophilus sonic extract, or a citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 4.0). We conclude that the inhibitory action of L. acidophilus on C. pylori is dependent on an extracellular secretory product, probably lactic acid. This inhibitory effect may be of therapeutic relevance in patients with C. pylori-positive acid-peptic disease.

AB  - Changes in the spectrum of the opacity of biodispersions containing L. acidophilus at the stage of growth have been studied. The pronounced positive correlation between the opacity of dispersion and the titer of cells, determined by the method of ultimate dilutions, have been shown.
TI  - Characterization of the temperate bacteriophage phi adh and plasmid transduction  in Lactobacillus acidophilus ADH.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus ADH is lysogenic and harbors an inducible prophage, phi adh. Bacteriophage were detected in cell lysates induced by treatment with mitomycin C or UV light. Electron microscopy of lysates revealed phage particles with a hexagonal head (62 nm) and a long, noncontractile, flexible tail (398 nm) ending in at last five short fibers. Phage phi adh was classified within Bradley's B1 phage group and the Siphoviridae family. The phi adh genome is a linear double-stranded DNA molecule of 41.7 kilobase pairs with cohesive ends: a physical map of the phi adh genome was constructed. A prophage-cured derivative of strain ADH, designated NCK102, was isolated from cells that survived UV exposure. NCK102 did not exhibit mitomycin C-induced lysis, but broth cultures lysed upon addition of phage. Phage phi adh produced clear plaques on NCK102 in media containing 10 mM CaCl2 at pH values between 5.2 and 5.5. A relysogenized derivative (NCK103) of NCK102 was isolated that exhibited mitomycin C-induced lysis and superinfection immunity to phage phi adh. Hybridization experiments showed that the phi adh genome was present in the ADH and NCK103 chromosomes, but absent in NCK102. These results demonstrated classic lytic and lysogenic cycles of replication for the temperate phage phi adh induced from L. acidophilus ADH. Phage phi adh also mediates transduction of plasmid DNA. Transductants of strain ADH containing pC194, pGK12, pGB354, and pVA797 were detected at frequencies in the range of 3.6 x 10(-8) to 8.3 x 10(-10) per PFU. Rearrangements or deletions were not detected in these plasmids as a consequence of transduction. This is the first description of plasmid transduction in the genus Lactobacillus.
TI  - Detection of lactobacilli and their interaction with clostridia in human gastrointestinal tracts and in vitro.
AB  - Culture counts of aerobic lactobacilli in the feces of vegetarians ([8.1 +/- 0.7] of log10 bacteria per gram dry weight) were higher than those of meat consumers ([5.2 +/- 0.1] of log10 bacteria per gram dry weight). Co-culture of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Clostridium perfringens in various media revealed that an interaction between these two species. The pH was the most important factor controlling their relative growth, which might explain the relative abundance of lactobacilli in feces of men and animals on vegetarian diets. Lactobacilli but not clostridia were detected in feces of newborn infants. These findings are discussed in relation to health.
TI  - Antibiosis of some lactic acid bacteria including Lactobacillus acidophilus toward Listeria monocytogenes.
AB  - Eleven strains of lactic acid bacteria were tested by the 'spot' on the 'lawn' method for their antagonistic activity against four strains of Listeria monocytogenes. Four out of the five strains of lactic acid bacteria most antagonistic toward the pathogen were those cultures known to produce bacteriocins. Four other strains of lactic acid bacteria were not antagonistic against Listeria by this method. Seventeen inhibition zones of the pathogen were obtained at 25 degrees C as compared to 10 at 32 degrees C. Lactobacillus acidophilus strains NU-A and 88, growing in the presence of L. monocytogenes in milk prevented the latter from attaining populations it would have in pure culture (P less than 0.01). 10(1.4)-10(3.5) lower numbers were noted. L. acidophilus in most cases exhibited a bacteriostatic effect toward the pathogen except for strain 88 which appeared to have a bactericidal effect (P less than 0.01) against Listeria strain OH. The lactobacilli reduced the pH of the milk to 4.7 over a 24 h period, showing that acid played a role in the observed antibiosis.
TI  - Impact of Lactobacillus acidophilus administration on the intestinal microflora after clindamycin treatment.
AB  
TI  - The effect of pH on the sensitivity of species of Lactobacillus to chlorhexidine  and the antibiotics minocycline and spiramycin.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the sensitivity of a range of Lactobacillus species to chlorhexidine, Minocycline, and Spiramycin, at a range of pH from 5.0 to 7.4. Strains of Streptococcus were also tested for their sensitivity to chlorhexidine, as a comparison between the genera. There were both inter- and intra-species variations in the sensitivity of these strains to chlorhexidine. The strains tested were sensitive at pH 6.7 to the following levels of chlorhexidine (micrograms/mL): L. casei (6 strains), 10-60; L. plantarum (4 strains), 40; L. fermentum (13 strains), 2-20; L. brevis (1 strain), 10; and L. acidophilus (3 strains), 10-60. The Streptococcus species were sensitive to 1-4 micrograms/mL (13 strains); 4-10 micrograms/mL (3 strains); and 10-20 micrograms/mL (2 strains). One strain was able to survive 20 micrograms/mL. Chlorhexidine was found to be less effective at lower pH levels. The following examples show sensitivity (micrograms/mL) at pH 6.5 followed by sensitivity at pH 5.0: L. casei (ATCC 15008), 40,60; L. plantarum (CH 374), 40,100; L. fermentum (CH 324) 10,40; L. acidophilus (ATCC 4356), 10,40; and S. mutans (BM 52), 2,2. All of the strains of Lactobacillus tested with Spiramycin were resistant at pH 5.0. Minocycline was less affected by changes in pH, but at pH 7.4 Lactobacillus strains were more resistant to Minocycline as compared with Spiramycin. Both of these antibiotics are bacteriostatic, and therefore may have a more limited effect than a bactericidal agent such as chlorhexidine. The Lactobacillus strains tested required higher concentrations of chlorhexidine than did the strains of Streptococcus for a killing effect in vitro.
TI  - [Increased efficiency in the disinfection of sewage by lactic acid bacteria].
AB  - The antimicrobic properties have been studied in 30 strains of lactobacilli. As a result a strain, the strongest antagonist relative to choleric vibrios and other enteropathogenic microorganisms, is selected. Lactobacilli are found to retain their viability and biological activity in the activated sludge during the whole period of observation (6 months). Biological disinfection of sewage is shown possible to be intensified using the activated sludge inoculated by the culture of the selected lactobacilli strain.

TI  - [Species composition of intestinal lactoflora of healthy rhesus monkeys].
AB  - The results of the study of the species composition of the fecal microflora of 15 healthy rhesus macaques, from whom 204 strains of lactobacilli have been isolated and identified, are presented. The intestinal microflora has been shown to include different species, subspecies and biovars of homo- and heterofermentative lactobacilli and to possess definite individual properties. L. acidophilus, mannose-negative biovar I, and L. fermentum, mannose-negative biovars I and II, occur most frequently in feces. Certain differences in the species composition of lactoflora in monkeys and humans have been revealed: in the former, L. fermentum, mannitose-positive biovar III, and L. casei occur considerably more seldom. The inclusion of L. acidophilus strain I L. fermentum strains I and II isolated from rhesus macaques into eubiotics for these monkeys has been suggested.

TI  - Genetic transfer systems for delivery of plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid to Lactobacillus acidophilus ADH: conjugation, electroporation, and transduction.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus ADH is a bacteriocin-producing human isolate that adheres to human fetal intestinal cells and human ileal cells. We have employed both electroporation and conjugation methodologies to transfer various plasmids to L. acidophilus ADH. Furthermore, we have demonstrated transduction of plasmid DNA within this strain by a temperate bacteriophage (phi adh) harbored by L. acidophilus ADH. Plasmid pGK12 was introduced into strain ADH by electroporation at frequencies as high as 3.3 X 10(5) transformants/micrograms of plasmid DNA. Transconjugants of strain ADH were recovered at frequencies of 10(-2) (pAMB1), 10(-4) (pVA797::Tn917), and 10(-4) (pVA797) per donor cell after filter-mating with Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. Plasmid pGK12 was transduced from a phage phi adh lysogen into a recipient strain of L. acidophilus ADH at an average frequency of 3.4 X 10(-8) transductants/pfu. Transformants, transconjugants, or transductants were verified by both phenotype and plasmid profile for acquisition of plasmid DNA. The ability to transfer plasmids and mobilize DNA sequences by electroporation, conjugation, and transduction will augment our efforts to define and characterize the activities of L. acidophilus in the intestinal tract.
TI  - [Lactitol and neomycin: monotherapy or combined therapy in the prevention and treatment of hepatic encephalopathy?].
AB  - The beneficial effect of disaccharides, lactulose and lactitol, in prevention and treatment of hepatic encephalopathy is well established but their use in combination with neomycin is still controversial. We studied in vitro the fecal bacterial growth, acid and gas formation in presence of lactitol (beta-galactoside-sorbitol) and neomycin alone or in combination. The results indicate that neomycin only inhibits the growth of susceptible bacteria (E. coli, Staph. aureus) which, conversely, are poor lactitol fermenters. The resistant organisms (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Clostridium perfringens) that are efficient disaccharide fermenters continue to metabolize lactitol still when antibiotic is added. Addition of lactitol 10% increased the inhibitory effect of neomycin on bacterial growth by 25-50% within 60-70 min. These preliminary data suggest that lactitol and neomycin may have additional or synergistic effects in vivo when used together in presence of favourable intestinal microbial environment.
TI  - Anticholesteremic property of Lactobacillus acidophilus yogurt fed to mature boars.
AB  - Three strains of Lactobacilus acidophilus (LA) were isolated from the feces of mature boars that were not being fed antibiotics from the Nebraska Gene Pool (NGP). All three LA isolates were screened in vitro for anticholesteremic and antimicrobial activities. One strain, LA16, caused the greatest reduction in cholesterol and inhibited both Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli the most. LA16 was used to produce 16, 18.9-liter quantities of acidophilus yogurt (AY), over a period of 8 wk, for use as a feed ingredient in diets for the NGP boars. Colony forming units (cfu), pH, protein, energy, Ca and P were consistent across all 16 batches of yogurt. All of the 18 boars were fed a high-cholesterol diet for a period of 56 d at a rate of 2.268 kg/(hd.d) to furnish 6.661 g/(hd.d) of cholesterol. Nine of the boars then were fed 1.81 kg/(hd.d) of a second diet that was supplemented with .454 kg/(hd.d) of AY. The other nine boars were fed the original diet. Cholesterol intake was the same for the two dietary treatments. Blood samples were collected weekly from the brachial-jugular region and the sera were analyzed for lipids. Acidophilus yogurt reduced serum cholesterol (P less than .01) and low density lipoproteins (P less than .08), but it had no effect on serum triglycerides (P greater than .23) or on high density lipoproteins (P greater than .11).
TI  - Population of Salmonella typhimurium in the cecum of gnotobiotic chickens.
AB  - To test the interaction of various species of bacteria with Salmonella typhimurium, levels of S. typhimurium were measured in the cecum of gnotobiotic chickens inoculated with various test bacteria and subsequently with S. typhimurium. The population of S. typhimurium was suppressed in the cecum of chickens previously inoculated with Escherichia coli. Populations of Bacteroides vulgatus, Clostridium perfringens, Bifidobacterium thermophilum, or Lactobacillus acidophilus were transiently, though not significantly, suppressed by S. typhimurium. Inoculation of chickens with C. perfringens caused a terminal increase in the population of S. typhimurium. Thus the effect of cecal contents on reducing the levels of S. typhimurium in the cecum may be due to the presence of E. coli in the cecal contents.
TI  - [Lactic bacteria in the digestive tract of poultry].
AB  - Lactic bacteria predominate in the microflora of the digestive tract of chicken and turkey. They are represented mainly by Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. salivarius, L. fermentum and L. buchneri. Streptococcus faecium is always isolated. L. ruminis, L. vitulinus, L. delbrueckii, L. coryniformis and L. viridescens were found in this ecological niche for the first time. S. faecium and S. faecalis prevail in the digestive tract of geese and ducks, while lactobacilli are detected in a lesser amount and are represented mainly by L. plantarum. L. salivarius cells isolated from the digestive tract of poultry are highly polymorphous. Most of the lactic acid bacteria found in the digestive tract of poultry can grow at 45-50 degrees C whatever is the species they belong to.

TI  - Bacterial vaginosis is not a simple ecological disorder.
AB  - Eighty-four patients with bacterial vaginosis were examined in an open randomized trial, the aim of which was to define clinical results and the microbiological panorama after topical treatment for 1 week with either an acetic acid jelly (A), an estrogen cream (B), a fermented milk product (C) or metronidazole (D). After exclusion because of chlamydia infection (15 cases) or for other reasons, 61 cases remained for complete evaluation 4 weeks after the start of treatment. Clinical cure was obtained in 3 cases out of 17 on regimen A, in 1 out of 16 on regimen B, in 1 of 14 on regimen C, and in 13 out of 14 on regimen D. The patients were conclusively either symptomless or symptomatic when examined on 113 occasions. Statistically significant reduction after treatment resulting in relief of symptoms was observed in the numbers of corynebacteria and anaerobic cocci, whereas lactobacilli increased in numbers. The instillation of high numbers of Lactobacillus acidophilus (C) into the vagina cured only 1 patient and did not influence the predominance of lactobacilli in the vagina at the follow-up examination. The difference in microbiological profile of women in symptomatic and asymptomatic conditions becomes still more apparent when the results of the present and previously published studies on the subject by the present group of investigators are combined. The symptomatic woman is significantly more often harboring corynebacteria, Gardnerella vaginalis, peptostreptococci, peptococci, eubacteria and Bacteroides species. Lactobacilli are significantly reduced in numbers. However, only 51% of our previously symptomatic, but now symptomless women show predominant growth of lactobacilli, which is less than expected for healthy women.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Effects of dysbacteriosis and impairment of immunity formation in the early neonatal period on morbidity of children during the 1st year of life and ways of its reduction].
AB  - The catamnesis of 124 infants has been studied in the course of 12 months by means of questionnaires. Dysbacteriosis that occur in the early neonatal period produce an unfavourable effect on the immunity establishment and increase the disease incidence among the neonates. Moreover, dysbacteriosis may later result in the impairment of the formation of tolerance to food antigens supplied to the gastrointestinal tract. The carriership of Staphylococcus aureus in the fauces occurring in the presence of the decreased characteristics of local defence and phagocytic system of the newborn favours an increase of the disease incidence in the babies as well as the formation of the chronic foci of infection in the future. Prevention of dysbacteriosis of the early neonatal period by means of the use of biopreparations, particularly of pure cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus does not only reduce the disease incidence in children of the first year of life but also improves on the whole their health status.
TI  - [Creating the optimal microecology of the intestines in premature newborn infants with the sour-milk mixture "biphilin"].
AB  - The paper is concerned with formation of intestinal biocenosis in premature infants and with approaches to the correction of its disorders with the aid of biphilin, a special mixture prepared from sour milk. Ninety newborns showed the derangement of biocenosis of various intensity by the 6th to the 10th day of life. Application of biphilin for 2 to 6 weeks as part of the multimodality treatment of such children made the intestinal microflora return to normal.
TI  - [Prevention of dysbacteriosis in the early neonatal period using a pure culture of acidophilic bacteria].
AB  - In order to prevent dysbacterioses occurring in the early neonatal period, 60 neonates classified with the risk group were administered, when they were still at the puerperal room, pure cultures of specially selected strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus possessing marked anti-Klebsiella activity and antagonistic activity against Staphylococcus aureus. The cultures were instilled into the mouth and nasal passages. Forty neonates administered bifidum-bacterin and 54 neonates not given biopreparations were used as control. Application of the pure culture of Lactobacillus acidophilus noticeably raised the efficacy of the preventive measures. Over 60 percent of the neonates were discharged from the maternity home with a normally formed intestinal microflora, 60 percent had normal microflora in the fauces, 80 percent in the nose, and 70 percent of the neonates demonstrated normal skin microflora. The carriage of opportunistic microorganisms in the fauces and nose of the neonates had decreased substantially by the time of the discharge from the maternity home, while the incidence of pyo-inflammatory diseases had also reduced among them.
TI  - Production of succinic Acid from citric Acid and related acids by lactobacillus strains.
AB  - A number of Lactobacillus strains produced succinic acid in de Man-Rogosa-Sharpe  broth to various extents. Among 86 fresh isolates from fermented cane molasses in Thailand, 30 strains (35%) produced succinic acid; namely, 23 of 39 Lactobacillus reuteri strains, 6 of 18 L. cellobiosus strains, and 1 of 6 unidentified strains. All of 10 L. casei subsp. casei strains, 5 L. casei subsp. rhamnosus strains, 6 L. mali strains, and 2 L. buchneri strains did not produce succinic acid. Among 58 known strains including 48 type strains of different Lactobacillus species, the strains of L. acidophilus, L. crispatus, L. jensenii, and L. parvus produced succinic acid to the same extent as the most active fresh isolates, and those of L. alimentarius, L. collinoides, L. farciminis, L. fructivorans (1 of 2 strains tested), L. malefermentans, and L. reuteri were also positive, to lesser extents. Diammonium citrate in de Man-Rogosa-Sharpe broth was determined as a precursor of the succinic acid produced. Production rates were about 70% on a molar basis with two fresh strains tested. Succinic acid was also produced from fumaric and malic acids but not from dl-isocitric, alpha-ketoglutaric, and pyruvic acids. The present study is considered to provide the first evidence on the production of succinic acid, an important flavoring substance in dairy products and fermented beverages, from citrate by lactobacilli.

TI  - Characterization and promoter selectivity of Lactobacillus acidophilus RNA polymerase.
AB  - DNA-dependent RNA polymerase has been purified from gram-positive Lactobacillus acidophilus and found to be composed of 4 protein subunits, alpha, beta, beta', and sigma, with molecular weights of 40,000, 150,000, 135,000, and 45,000 kD, respectively, estimated on the basis of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified enzyme exhibits optimal activity in the presence of Mn2+, while Mg2+ shows only a slight effect. The L. acidophilus enzyme transcribes several Escherichia coli promoters examined so far, such as promoters of trp operon, lacUV5, and bla P3 from pBR322, whereas it lacks the ability to recognize bla P1 and tet P2 promoters from pBR322. Thus, the specificity of L. acidophilus RNA polymerase in recognizing the promoters is somehow different from that of the E. coli enzyme. By means of an in vitro transcription assay system for L. acidophilus RNA polymerase, 2 promoters have been identified in the DNA of an L. acidophilus cryptic plasmid (pRNL5). These promoters possess nucleotide sequences in the -10 region similar to the consensus sequence for the E. coli promoters.
TI  - Trichomonal vaginitis refractory to treatment: case report.

Throughout that period the patient received 5-nitroimidazoles at conventional and high dosages, antimicrobial agents to eliminate vaginal organisms capable of interfering with treatment, acidifying preparations, and vaccination with inactivated Lactobacillus acidophilus. Despite all the regimens used, the condition remained refractory to treatment.

TI  - Amino-terminal nucleotide-binding sequences of a Lactobacillus deoxynucleoside kinase complex isolated by novel affinity chromatography.
AB  - A highly efficient new affinity medium for deoxycytidine kinase, deoxycytidine 5'-tetraphosphate-Sepharose (dCp4-Sepharose), has been constructed. A dCp4-Sepharose column effects a one-step, 19,000-fold, purification to homogeneity of dCyd kinase from the ammonium sulfate fraction of Lactobacillus acidophilus R-26 extract, with 60% recovery. dCTP, a potent end-product inhibitor, is used as an eluent, and it also stabilizes the extremely labile purified enzyme. A noncompeting deoxyadenosine kinase activity accompanies the deoxycytidine kinase activity eluted. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis shows a single protein band, which coincides with both deoxycytidine kinase and deoxyadenosine kinase activities at several gel concentrations. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reveals a single polypeptide band of 26,000 daltons. Since the native enzyme is known to have an Mr of 50,000, it appears that the enzyme is composed of two subunits of similar size. Sequence analysis of the intact protein from the N-terminus reveals but a single amino acid species per residue up to the 17th residue; at the 18th, 21st, 26th, and 27th residue positions of the sequence, however, there appear to be two different amino acids in almost equal amounts. This may indicate that the enzyme is composed of two nonidentical subunits having the same amino acid sequence near the N-terminus. Residues 6-13 contain the highly conserved Gly-X-X-Gly-X-Gly-Lys sequence found at the active sites of kinases and other nucleotide-binding proteins.
TI  - Effects of Lactic Acid Bacteria and Organic Acids on Growth and Germination of Bacillus cereus.
AB  - Growth and germination of vegetative cells and endospores of Bacillus cereus were affected by Streptococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus bulgaricus in nonfat milk medium and by salts of organic acids in broth medium. Growth of the lactic acid bacteria was not affected by B. cereus. B. cereus increased rapidly to about 10 CFU/ml when cells were added at the beginning of growth of lactic acid bacteria; it was inactivated slowly when added after 24 h and rapidly when added after 72 h of lactic acid bacterial growth. Streptococci were more inhibitory to the growth of B. cereus than lactobacilli were at 24 h. Spore germination was not affected after 24 h, but it was inhibited after 48 and 72 h of lactic acid bacterial growth. Acetate was more inhibitory to the growth of vegetative cells, while formate was more inhibitory to spore germination. Acetate, formate, and lactate (all at 0.1 M) completely inactivated multiplication of B. cereus at pH 6.1, 6.0, and 5.6, respectively. Spores of B. cereus were more resistant to these organic acids compared with the resistance of vegetative cells. Formate, lactate, and acetate (all at 0.1 M) caused 50% inhibition of spore germination at pH 4.4, 4.3, and 4.2, respectively.
TI  - Application of electroporation for transfer of plasmid DNA to Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Listeria, Pediococcus, Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Enterococcus and Propionibacterium.
AB  - Plasmid DNA was introduced by electroporation into Bacillus, Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Listeria, Pediococcus, Propionibacterium and Staphylococcus as an alternative to competent-cell or protoplast transformation. Plasmid-containing transformants were recovered in these recipients at frequencies ranging from 10(1) to 10(5) transformants micrograms-1 of pGK12. Several parameters of the protocol, including DNA concentration, voltage, plating regimen and electroporation buffers were evaluated to determine conditions that improved transformation frequencies for Lactobacillus acidophilus. Using optimized conditions, the following plasmids were introduced into L. acidophilus: pAMB1, pC194, pGB354, pGKV1, pSA3, pTRK13, pTV1 and pVA797. The ability to transfer plasmid DNA via eletroporation will greatly facilitate the application of recombinant DNA methodology and transposon technology to Gram-positive bacteria for cloning and analysis of significant genes.

AB  
TI  - Detection of a Lactobacillus substance that inhibits Escherichia coli.
AB  - Recent studies have shown that certain lactobacilli strains have the ability to interfere with the adherence and growth of uropathogenic bacteria. This interaction is believed to be important in the maintenance of a normal urogenital flora and in the prevention of infection in females. In the present study, Lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus acidophilus 76 were found to exert an inhibitory effect on pyelonephritogenic mutant Escherichia coli Hu 734 and E. coli ATCC 25922. The bioactivity of the inhibitor produced by strain GR-1 was retained under pH buffered conditions and was bactericidal. The bioactive substance was heat labile, not precipitated by up to 80% ammonium sulphate, and extractable in chloroform. The data indicated that the inhibitor is not lactic acid or hydrogen peroxide and has a molecular weight greater than 12,000-14,000. Human urine supported production of the inhibitor and reduced and delayed outgrowth of the E. coli. The ability of L. casei GR-1 and possibly other lactobacilli strains to produce inhibitors of uropathogenic bacteria may have clinical importance and significance in the microbial ecology of the urogenital tract.
TI  - [Adjuvant activity of lactic bacteria: perspectives for its use in oral vaccines].
AB  - The effect of the oral and subcutaneous administration of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus on humoral antibody production and delayed type hypersensitivity response against sheep red blood cells (SRBC) was studied. The species of the genus Lactobacillus proved to be more effective in both cases, effects being stronger when working with viable bacteria than with non-viable cells. The stimulation of primary cellular and humoral immune responses reached optimal activity with a dose of 6 x 10(9) cells. The plaque-forming cells (PFC) and the circulating antibody titers to the SRBC antigen obtained in the groups treated with lactobacilli were 2 to 3 times higher than those of the non-treated control group. In mice fed with the different lactic acid bacteria circulating antibody against these microorganisms failed to be detected, but when they were administered by subcutaneous route a strong response to antilactic acid bacteria was stimulated. S. thermophilus was not effective in increasing the immune response. These results suggest that the lactobacilli by oral route, exert a strong adjuvant activity which is responsible for the enhanced host immune responses obtained. In this respect, lactobacilli could be considered as the most promising oral adjuvant.
TI  - Metabolism and some characteristics of lactobacilli isolated from the rumen of young calves.
AB  - Fourteen strains of lactobacilli isolated from the rumen of young calves were studied to determine their biochemical characteristics, growth parameters, metabolism on lactose and sensitivity to 28 antimicrobial agents. Thirteen homofermentative strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus and one heterofermentative strain resembled Lact. fermentum. The relevance of rumen lactobacilli to the nutrition of calves is discussed.
TI  - Preservation of intestinal integrity during radiotherapy using live Lactobacillus acidophilus cultures.
AB  - Twenty-four female patients suffering from gynaecological malignancies and scheduled for internal and external irradiation of the pelvic area (pelvic dose 5000 cGy) were selected for a study on prevention of intestinal side-effects by live Lactobacillus acidophilus cultures. The patients were randomised into two groups. Both groups received dietary counselling recommending a low-fat and low-residue diet during radiotherapy. The control group received dietary counselling only. The test group received 150 ml of a fermented milk test product supplying them with at least 2 X 10(9) live Lactobacillus acidophilus bacteria daily and 6.5% lactulose as substrate for the bacteria. The results indicated that the test product appeared to prevent radiotherapy-associated diarrhoea. However, flatulence was increased probably due to lactulose ingestion in the test group.
TI  - Possible treatment of AIDS patients with live lactobacteria.
AB  - The enhancement of antimicrobial resistance and immunomodulatory action, and the  anabolic effect caused by the consumption of live lactobacteria as a dietary adjunct are proposed by the author as sufficient reasons to test lactobacterial preparations in patients with AIDS. The problem of dosage is discussed and a practical solution presented.
TI  - Influence of Storage at Freezing and Subsequent Refrigeration Temperatures on beta-Galactosidase Activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - The ability of three strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus to survive and retain beta-galactosidase activity during storage in liquid nitrogen at -196 degrees C and during subsequent storage in milk at 5 degrees C was tested. The level of beta-galactosidase activity varied among the three strains (0.048 to 0.177 U/10 organisms). Freezing and storage at -196 degrees C had much less adverse influence on viability and activity of the enzyme than did storage in milk at 5 degrees C. The strains varied in the extent of the losses of viability and beta-galactosidase activity during both types of storage. There was not a significant interaction between storage at -196 degrees C and subsequent storage at 5 degrees C. The strains that exhibited the greatest losses of beta-galactosidase activity during storage in milk at 5 degrees C also exhibited the greatest losses in viability at 5 degrees C. However, the losses in viability were of much greater magnitude than were the losses of enzymatic activity. This indicates that some cells of L. acidophilus which failed to form colonies on the enumeration medium still possessed beta-galactosidase activity. Cultures of L. acidophilus to be used as dietary adjuncts to improve lactose utilization in humans should be carefully selected to ensure that adequate beta-galactosidase activity is provided.
TI  - Does lactobacillus vaccine for trichomoniasis, Solco Trichovac, induce antibody reactive with Trichomonas vaginalis?
AB  - Solco Trichovac is a vaccine of Lactobacillus acidophilus developed for treating  trichomoniasis. The efficacy of the vaccine is reportedly due to cross reacting antibody being produced in people immunised with the lactobacillus bacteria. Several techniques, including enzyme linked immunosorbent, indirect immunofluorescence, immunoblot, and radioimmunoprecipitation assays were used to assess the extent of antigenic cross reactivity between Lactobacillus acidophilus and Trichomonas vaginalis. Data show a lack of antigenic relatedness between the Solco Trichovac lactobacilli and several strains of T vaginalis. Furthermore, antiserum to L acidophilus failed to inhibit trichomonad cytadherence or host cell killing, as is suggested by the producers of the Solco Trichovac vaccine.
TI  - An introduction to rod-shaped lactic-acid bacteria.
AB  - The genus Lactobacillus is mainly found in the intestinal tract of healthy humans and animals as well as in fermenting vegetables or plant materials, such as silage. It has a moderate diffusion in meat products and is rarely found in wines and beers. On the other hand, rod-shaped lactic-acid bacteria are largely used in the preparation of a variety of foods and feed products. As starter cultures, they are omnipresent in cheeses and dairy manufacturing. Specific fermentation processes have been developed in order to encourage the growth of the desired species, some of which are fastidious organisms such as L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, L. helveticus and L. sanfrancisco. In addition, a promising and interesting perspective is the use of rod-shaped lactic-acid bacteria, primarily L. acidophilus, L. reuteri and L. salivarius as probiotic starters to preserve the natural biological equilibrium of the intestinal tract.
TI  - Genetic transformation in Lactobacillus sp. strain 100-33 of the capacity to colonize the nonsecreting gastric epithelium in mice.
AB  - Lactobacillus isolates able to colonize the surfaces of the nonsecreting epithelia in the stomachs of monoassociated ex-germfree mice were derived from Lactobacillus acidophilus 100-33. Strain 100-33 was originally isolated from pig feces and is unable to colonize the murine gastric epithelium. In experiments involving attempts genetically to transform the capacity to colonize the epithelium, cells of strain 100-33 were treated with muralytic enzymes and mixed with polyethylene glycol and genomic or plasmid DNA extracted from Lactobacillus fermentum RI. Strain RI was originally isolated from a conventional mouse and has the capacity to colonize the nonsecreting gastric epithelium. The mixtures containing cells, polyethylene glycol, and DNA were plated on a regeneration medium. After overnight incubation, the cells were washed from the plates and introduced by gastric gavage into germfree mice. Only mice that received regenerated 100-33 cells previously mixed with genomic DNA from strain RI had layers of gram-positive bacteria on the keratinized epithelia of their stomachs. Six isolates cultured from the washed gastric tissues of these animals were characterized. When a culture of each or a pool of cultures of the six were orally administered to germfree mice, layers of gram-positive bacterial cells were visible on the keratinized gastric epithelia of the animals within 1 to 3 weeks. Cells of all six, but not of strain 100-33, reacted with antibody made in rabbits to L. fermentum RI cells, as determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Nevertheless, all six had fermentation profiles identical to that of strain 100-33.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Bacteriocin involved in premature death of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM during  growth at pH 6.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM maintained at pH 6 during growth in lactobacilli MRS broth appeared to exhibit premature death. However, during extended incubation, the culture reinitiated growth. Spent broth collected from the culture when it began the premature death was very toxic to the culture, but growth did occur during extended incubation of the assay tubes. When several successive subcultures with extended incubation were made in MRS broth containing added inhibitory spent broth, a strain (identified as L. acidophilus) was isolated that was resistant to the inhibitor. This strain produced a bacteriocin that was inhibitory to the growth of L. acidophilus NCFM and the predominating strains isolated from it. The producer strain grew more slowly than did the predominating strains in culture NCFM. The results show that when L. acidophilus NCFM, a mixed strain culture, was grown at pH 6, the inhibitory strain was able to grow sufficiently to produce enough bacteriocin to destroy the predominating strain(s) in the culture.
TI  - Production of volatile fatty acids as a result of bacterial interactions in the cecum of gnotobiotic rats and chickens fed a lactose-containing diet.
AB  - Volatile fatty acid (VFA) productions from lactose and lactate by a Clostridium butyricum and a Veillonella alcalescens strain, alone or in combination with a Lactobacillus acidophilus strain, were determined both in vitro in culture media and in vivo in the ceca of gnotobiotic animals. Gnotobiotic rats, which possess intestinal lactase, and chickens, which are devoid of it, were used. Both animal species were fed a diet containing 4% lactose. The in vitro results showed that the C. butyricum strain fermented lactose and D-lactic acid to butyric and acetic acids, whereas L-lactic acid was not fermented. The V. alcalescens strain did not ferment lactose and fermented L better than D-lactic acid. The in vivo results showed that high VFA concentrations were obtained in the ceca of chickens either disassociated with V. alcalescens or C. butyricum and Lactobacillus strains or monoassociated with C. butyricum. VFA concentrations in the ceca of rats were low, whatever strain the rats harbored. In addition, an antagonistic effect of the C. butyricum strain against the Lactobacillus strain was evidenced both in rats and chickens. It is suggested that the absence of a host lactase makes the chick a good model for lactose intolerance studies in human newborns.
TI  - Impact of Lactobacillus acidophilus on the normal intestinal microflora after administration of two antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Twenty healthy volunteers participated in a comparative study concerning the influence of Lactobacillus acidophilus supplements on the normal intestinal microflora after the administration of two antimicrobial agents, enoxacin and clindamycin, respectively. L. acidophilus NCFB 1748 was given as a fermented milk product containing 5 x 10(8)-2 x 10(9) CFU/ml to ten of the volunteers immediately after the administration of the antimicrobial agents. On the seventh day of enoxacin administration enterobacteria were eliminated in nine of ten subjects. Enterococci disappeared or decreased significantly in five subjects. During the L. acidophilus supplementation, there was a significant increase in the number of Escherichia coli in one subject, while enterococci returned to the same level as before enoxacin administration in all subjects.
TI  - Adherence of specific yogurt micro-organisms to human peripheral blood lymphocytes.
AB  - Yogurt lactic-acid-bacteria (LAB) consisting of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus were evaluated for their capacity to bind to human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). These micro-organisms adhere to human T lymphocytes, and bind to B lymphocytes, in high and low frequencies, respectively. In addition, a quantitative analysis of LAB binding to PBL was carried out using the same parameters previously applied to a Salmonella model. The effect of yogurt LAB on the natural anti-bacterial activity exerted by PBL was examined. Lymphocyte pretreatment with bacteria did not affect such functions. These findings are discussed in the light of the well known ability of yogurt LAB to modulate the immune response.
TI  - Systemic augmentation of the immune response in mice by feeding fermented milks with Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - This study investigates the effect of feeding fermented milks with Lactobacillus  casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus and a mixture of both micro-organisms on the specific and non-specific host defence mechanisms in Swiss mice. Animals fed with fermented milk for 8 days (100 micrograms/day) showed an increase in both phagocytic and lymphocytic activity. This activation of the immune system began on the 3rd day, reached a maximum on the 5th, and decreased slightly on the 8th day of feeding. In the 8-day treated mice, boosted with a single dose (100 micrograms) on the 11th day, the immune response increased further. The feeding with fermented milk produced neither hepatomegaly nor splenomegaly. These results suggest that L. casei and L. acidophilus, associated with intestinal mucosae, can influence the level of activation of the immune system. The possible clinical application of fermented milks as immunopotentiators is also discussed.
TI  - Enhancement of host resistance against Listeria infection by Lactobacillus casei: efficacy of cell wall preparation of Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - Cell wall, cytoplasm, polysaccharide, and peptidoglycan fractions prepared from Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, and L. acidophilus were examined for their efficacies to enhance resistance of host mice against Listeria monocytogenes infection. Intraperitoneal injections of those cellular fractions of L. casei led to elicitation of inflammatory cells in the peritoneal cavity and the efficacy was highest in the case of peptidoglycan. Macrophage ratio in the resultant peritoneal exudate cells was also highest in mice given peptidoglycan. Macrophages induced with cell wall fraction of L. casei showed the most potent phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-triggered respiratory burst (chemiluminescence and O2- production determined on the basis of nitroblue tetrazolium reduction) followed by those elicited with peptidoglycan. All the macrophages induced with cell wall of L. casei (two strains) and L. acidophilus enhanced O2- production in response to PMA but L. plantarum did not enhance O2(-)-producing ability in such a manner. The L. casei-cell wall also enhanced in vitro listericidal activity of mouse peritoneal macrophages, but such an activity was not noted in the case of L. acidophilus-cell wall. When mice were intravenously given the cellular fractions 7 or 13 days before L. monocytogenes infection, cell wall fractions of L. casei caused the most potent protective activity. A weak protective activity was also found in peptidoglycan of L. casei. Therefore, the protective action of L. casei against L. monocytogenes infection in host mice may be attributed to cell wall compounds and partially to the peptidoglycan moiety.
TI  - Frequency and occurrence of Lactobacillus acidophilus in the gut of the pig, as indicated by its presence in the faeces.
AB  - Faecal samples of 2 pigs, kept on a constant diet, were analysed for Lactobacillus acidophilus and other lactic acid bacteria at 1 week intervals over a period of 3 months. Enumeration of L. acidophilus by selective methods was verified by phenotypic identification of representative isolates. The total lactic acid bacteria (LAB) population ranged between 10(8) and 10(10) colony-forming units per gram of faeces over the 3 months period. L. acidophilus contributed on average a relatively constant figure of 10% to the total LAB population.
TI  - Enterococcus lactic acid bacteria strain SF68 and lactulose in hepatic encephalopathy: a controlled study.
AB  - Forty cirrhotic patients with non-advanced hepatic encephalopathy were randomly allocated into groups which were given orally either two capsules three times daily of a preparation of Enterococcus lactic acid bacteria strain SF68 or 30 ml lactulose four times daily. The patients were evaluated over a 10-day course of treatment and for 10 days post-treatment. The Enterococcus SF68 preparation proved to be as effective as lactulose in lowering blood ammonia, and in improving mental state and psychometric performance. Moreover, the effects of Enterococcus SF68, contrary to that of lactulose, persisted longer after treatment withdrawal. Some patients reported diarrhoea and abdominal pain with lactulose. Lactulose is a standard therapy in the treatment of patients with hepatic encephalopathy. In this study, however, the use of the Enterococcus SF68 preparation was shown to offer advantages over lactulose in these patients.
TI  - Betaine Transport Imparts Osmotolerance on a Strain of Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Unlike most Lactobacillus acidophilus strains, a specific strain, L. acidophilus  IFO 3532, was found to grow in rich medium containing 1 M sodium acetate, KCl, or NaCl. This strain could also grow with up to 1.8 M NaCl or 3 M nonelectrolytes (fructose, xylose, or sorbitol) added. Thus, this strain was tolerant to osmotic pressures up to 2.8 osM. A search for an intracellular solute which conferred osmoprotection led to the identification of glycine betaine (betaine). Betaine was accumulated to high concentrations in cells growing in MRS medium supplemented with 1 M KCl or NaCl. Uptake of [C]betaine by L. acidophilus 3532 cells suspended in buffer was stimulated by increasing the medium osmotic pressure with 1 M KCl or NaCl. The accumulated betaine was not metabolized further; transport was relatively specific for betaine and was dependent on an energy source. Other lactobacilli, more osmosensitive than strain 3532, including L. acidophilus strain E4356, L. bulgaricus 8144, and L. delbrueckii 9649, showed lower betaine transport rates in response to an osmotic challenge than L. acidophilus 3532. Experiments with chloramphenicol-treated L. acidophilus 3532 cells indicated that the transport system was not induced but appeared to be activated by an increase in osmotic pressure.
TI  - Identification of vaginal lactobacilli from asymptomatic women.
AB  - In the present work, carried out by means of phenotypic and genotypic tests, it has been demonstrated that none of the vaginal lactobacilli isolated from asymptomatic women were genetically close to L. acidophilus ATCC 4356. Strains of homofermentative lactobacilli were identified as Lactobacillus gasseri, L. jensenii and L. crispatus, while in the heterofermentative only one strain was classified as L. fermentum. Moreover a genetically homologous group of heterofermentative lactobacilli, that could represent a new species, were evidenced.
TI  - [Efficacy of regulators of the intestinal bacterial flora in the therapy of acne  vulgaris].
AB  
TI  - [Isolation and characteristics of plasmid DNA from Lactobacilli].
AB  - It was shown on a model of 2 collection strains of lactobacilli that their cultivation on a synthetic multicomponent medium with addition of threonine and subsequent exposure of the cells to lysozyme at 0 degrees C and to alkaline solution of sodium dodecylsulfate at 60 degrees C provided highly efficient detection of plasmid DNA in these organisms. Circular molecules of the plasmid DNA of the 7-kv length, their dimer forms and linear molecules were detected in both of the strains.
TI  - Deletion analysis of sucrose metabolic genes from a Salmonella plasmid cloned in  Escherichia coli K12.
AB  - The sucrose operon from pUR400, a 78-kbp conjugative Salmonella plasmid, was cloned in Escherichia coli K12. The operon was located in a 5.7-kbp SalI restriction fragment and was subcloned, in each of two possible orientations, using the expression vector pUC18. The insert DNA was restriction mapped and duplicate restriction sites in the insert and in the polylinker of the vector were used to create various deletions promoter distal in the operon sequence. Additional deletions were made with the restriction exonuclease Bal31. Cells containing hybrid plasmids with specified deletions lacked the ability to transport sucrose or were constitutive for hydrolase and/or uptake activities. The scrA (enzyme IIScr) and scrR (regulatory) genes resided within 2900-bp SmaI-SalI DNA fragment and were assigned the order scrB, scrA, scrR. An amplified sucrose-inducible gene product, Mr 68,000, was detected only in the membrane fraction from recombinant cells that contained plasmid with the intact operon sequence. This protein represented 11% of the total membrane protein and was resistant to extraction with 0.5 M sodium chloride, 2% Triton X-100, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. The protein did not appear to be the product of either the scrA, scrB, or scrR gene and may therefore represent a previously unidentified membrane-bound sucrose protein. A new gene, scrC, is proposed. In addition, the cloned 5.7-kbp SalI and 2.5-kbp SmaI-SalI DNA fragments failed to hybridize to chromosomal DNA from Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus lactis, Streptococcus mutans, and Lactobacillus acidophilus as well as to DNA from a sucrose plasmid from Salmonella tennessee. However, the probes showed weak homology with a 20-kbp EcoRI restriction fragment from Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - The influence of various bacteria on the cecal mucosa of monoflora chickens infected with Eimeria tenella. A scanning electron microscopic study.
AB  - Monoflora chickens were established at the age of 2 days by an oral inoculation of one of six species of bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium thermophilum, Bacteroides vulgatus, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, or Streptococcus faecalis). Two days later the chickens were infected with Eimeria tenella (5 X 10(4) oocytes per bird). There were four groups: uninfected birds as controls, the birds infected with either bacteria or E. tenella alone, and the birds infected with bacteria and E. tenella. As observed under the scanning electron microscope (SEM) seven days after E. tenella infection, damage of the cecal mucosa in all groups infected with bacteria + E. tenella was more severe than in that infected with E. tenella alone. Most severe damage to the cecal mucosa was found in the birds infected with either C. perfringens or B. thermophilum combined with E. tenella.
TI  - Characterization and DNA homology of Lactobacillus strains isolated from pig intestine.
AB  - Twenty strains of the genus Lactobacillus were isolated from pig intestines and characterized with phenotypic tests. Eleven of these strains, together with selected reference strains, were subjected to DNA homology studies. Three major groups could be distinguished by biochemical/physiological tests and by DNA homology studies: one homofermentative group of the subgenus Thermobacterium and two heterofermentative groups. The DNA homology studies revealed that strains from the homofermentative group were related to Lactobacillus acidophilus strain VPI 1754, but showed a low relationship to the type strain of Lact. acidophilus. One One group of the heterofermentative strains was related to the type strain of Lact. reuteri; the other group, consisting of three strains, showed a low relationship to all reference strains used. These three strains had the unusual property of producing succinic acid in large amounts.
TI  - Enhancement of immune response in mice fed with Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Swiss mice, fed for 8 consecutive d with 50 micrograms/d of viable cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Streptococcus thermophilus, showed significant variation in their immune system. In order to study this phenomenon assays for macrophage and lymphocyte function were carried out. Both lactic acid bacteria enhanced significantly the enzymatic and phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophages as checked against the controls and also accelerated the phagocytic function of the reticuloendothelial system as revealed by the carbon clearance test. On the 2nd d (100 micrograms), L. acidophilus reached a peak of K = .271, which remained high. Streptococcus thermophilus was effective only on the 2nd d and then decreased. The lymphocytic activity studied by immunoglobulin secreting cells was assayed by Jerne's method of plaque-forming cells (PFC). This activity also was increased by the two microorganisms. Streptococcus thermophilus proved more effective than L. acidophilus. Lactobacillus acidophilus and S. thermophilus activated macrophages and lymphocytes and produced the same increase in the immune response of mice whether administered orally or intraperitoneally.
TI  - Effect of infection with Eimeria tenella upon the cecal bacterial population in monoflora chickens.
AB  - Monoflora chickens were established at 2 days of age by an oral inoculation with  one of six species of bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium thermophilum, Bacteroides vulgatus, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, or Streptococcus faecalis) and were infected with Eimeria tenella (5 X 10(4) oocysts per bird) 2 days later. There were two experimental groups for each bacterium: birds infected with bacteria alone and birds infected with a combination of bacteria and E. tenella. Seven days after E. tenella infection, counts of B. thermophilum in the cecal contents were significantly lower for E. tenella-infected birds than for those infected by B. thermophilum alone, whereas 10 days after E. tenella infection, counts were higher for E. tennella-infected birds. The population of L. acidophilus in the cecal contents of the E. tenella-infected chickens 10 days after inoculation was significantly greater than that in uninfected chickens. No significant differences were observed between the numbers of B. vulgatus, C. perfringens, and S. faecalis in cecal contents of groups with and without E. tenella infections.
TI  - Conjugal Transfer of Plasmid-Encoded Determinants for Bacteriocin Production and  Immunity in Lactobacillus acidophilus 88.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus 88 produced a bacteriocin, designated lactacin F, that  demonstrated inhibitory activity toward L. acidophilus 6032, L. lactis 970, L. helveticus 87, L. bulgaricus 1489, L. leichmanii 4797, L. fermentum 1750, and Streptococcus faecalis 19433. Production of lactacin F was pH dependent and could be maximized in MRS broth cultures maintained at pH 7.0. Lactacin F was heat stable and sensitive to ficin, proteinase K, trypsin, and Bacillus subtilis protease. L. acidophilus 88 harbored plasmids of 4 and 27 megadaltons. Variants of L. acidophilus 88 which were deficient in lactacin F production (Laf) and lactacin F immunity (Laf) retained the two resident plasmids. A Laf Laf derivative, L. acidophilus 89, was used as a recipient in agar surface mating experiments with L. acidophilus 88 (Laf Laf). Two types of Laf Laf transconjugants were recovered. One type (T-E) had acquired two plasmids of 68 (pPM68) and 52 (pPM52) megadaltons that were not detected in either the conjugal donor or the other type of Laf Laf transconjugants (T-89). Laf and Laf were unstable in the plasmid-bearing transconjugant. Plasmid analysis of Laf Laf variants revealed that pPM52 and pPM68 were cured with loss of Laf and Laf. Bacteriocin production and immunity phenotypes were genetically stable in Laf Laf transconjugants not harboring pPM52 and pPM68, suggesting chromosomal integration of the transferred determinants. The data demonstrated intragenic conjugation in L. acidophilus and provided direct evidence for involvement of transient plasmid determinants in Laf and Laf.
TI  - Modification of sweet acidophilus milk to improve utilization by lactose-intolerant persons.
AB  - Enhanced digestion of yogurt by lactose-intolerant individuals is believed to be  due to inherent beta-galactosidase (lactase) in the culture organisms that aids in the hydrolysis of ingested lactose. However, sweet acidophilus milk, which contains lactase-rich organisms, does not enhance lactose digestion. Using breath-hydrogen measurements to indicate malabsorption in 14 human subjects, we compared utilization of: milk, yogurt, heated yogurt, yogurt plus lactose, heated yogurt plus lactase, sweet acidophilus milk (SAM), and SAM made with sonicated cells. Results indicate that both the reduction of lactose during fermentation and the presence of indigenous bacterial lactase are responsible for the increased ability to tolerate lactose in yogurt. Improved utilization of SAM by sonication suggests that intracellular lactase is not available during digestion and that sonication releases the lactase activity from the cells.
TI  - Evaluation of antinfective activity of an association bifidobacterium/lactobacillus in mouse intestine.
AB  - The present research aimed at studying the action of an association of Bifidobacterium bifidum and Lactobacillus acidophilus, in controlling an experimental severe infection by Salmonella enteritidis administered in mouse per os. The behaviour of some parameters was undertaken, checking for the pH of intestinal content; the condition of the colonization in the intestinal wall by means of scanning electron microscopy and plates cultures; the presence of antibodies IgA in intestinal content; the index of mortality in the diversely treated animal's groups. The reported data show a string incidence of the administration of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in increasing the animal's resistance against the lethal infection.
TI  - [Bacteriological investigation of the cariogenic effects of sugar alcohols and sucrose].
AB  - Considerable evidence indicates that the disaccharide, sucrose is probably the major dietary factor in dental caries formation and much subsequent research has gone into the search for another sweetener to replace sucrose. Currently, there is much interest in the development of new sweeteners and the cariogenic properties of sugar alcohols. The present study aimed to examine the cariogenic properties of sugar alcohols (xylitol, sorbitol, mannitol) and sucrose on growth pattern and acid production of S. mutans, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. faecalis, S. viridans, L. casei and L. acidophilus in vitro by using Photo Electrical Colorimeter and pH meter. In conclusion the results in this study showed that out of sugar alcohols, xylitol is the only compound which, depending on its concentration, significantly did not affect the growth and acid production of all tested micro organisms.
TI  - Impact of Lactobacillus acidophilus supplements on the human oropharyngeal and intestinal microflora.
AB  - The influence of Lactobacillus acidophilus supplements on the oropharyngeal and intestinal microflora was studied before, during and after L. acidophilus administration. 10 healthy volunteers participated in the study. L. acidophilus was given as a fermented milk product containing 5 X 10(8)-2 X 10(9) CFU/ml in a dose of 250 ml twice a day for 7 days. Only minor changes in the number of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms in the oropharynx were observed, with no increase in the number of lactobacilli. In the aerobic intestinal microflora a decrease in the number of Escherichia coli was observed in 6/10 subjects. Concerning the anaerobic intestinal microflora there was a significant increase in the number of lactobacilli in 9/10 subjects within 7 days of L. acidophilus administration. The increase in the number of lactobacilli remained as long as the subjects were consuming the L. acidophilus preparation. Lactobacilli returned to the same level as before the study 9 days after the L. acidophilus administration was stopped. Anaerobic cocci showed a decrease in 4/10 subjects, while the number of other anaerobic bacteria remained relatively constant throughout the observation time. These studies suggest that L. acidophilus in this type of preparation should be taken continuously in order to maintain high levels of lactobacilli in the intestine.
TI  - Selection of Lactobacillus acidophilus strains for use in "acidophilus products".
AB  - Recent studies by DNA-DNA hybridization revealed that strains now designated as L. acidophilus, can be divided into several groups and only one group should be classified as L. acidophilus. We studied several phenotypic characteristics in representative strains from the six DNA-homology groups of L. acidophilus. No group specific pattern was observed among the strains for fermentation of eight carbohydrates, growth at 15 and 45 degrees C, resistance to 0.2% oxgall, lysis by lysozyme or sensitivity to 17 antibiotics. However, some differences among groups were observed in beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) activity and surface layer (s-layer) protein. Strains in B1 do not have a s-layer or beta-gal while B2 strains also lack a s-layer but do possess beta-gal. All strains in groups A1, A2, A3 and A4, capable of growing in lactose, have beta-gal activity and also have a s-layer composed of protein subunits of different molecular weights (MW). Strains in A1 homology group have a s-layer with 46 Kd protein subunits while strains in other A groups have s-layer protein subunits that varied in MW within each group. On the basis of these two traits several isolates of unknown homology groups have been tentatively placed in A1, B1 or B2 groups. L. acidophilus from A1 group showed strain variation in beta-gal specific activity and rate of acid production and growth. For use in dietary adjuncts, L. acidophilus strains should be selected for these three and other desirable traits. They should be maintained and grown in media containing lactose.

TI  - Survival of lactic acid bacteria in the human stomach and adhesion to intestinal  cells.
AB  - The survival of four strains of lactic acid bacteria in human gastric juice, in vivo and in vitro, and in buffered saline, pH 1 to 5, has been investigated. The strains studied include two Lactobacillus acidophilus strains, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. In addition, the adhesion of these strains to freshly collected human and pig small intestinal cells and to pig large intestinal cells has been studied and the effect of milk on both survival and adhesion tested. As a result of these investigations, an in vitro test system for screening potential cultures for use as human dietary adjuncts can be developed. The ability to survive in gastric juice and to adhere varied significantly for the strains tested; L. acidophilus ADH survived and adhered better than the others while S. thermophilus survived and adhered poorly. For all strains, both survival and adhesion was enhanced by milk. As all strains adhered to some extent to both human and pig intestinal cells, the adhesion mechanism is probably a nonspecific attachment as opposed to other reported specific Lactobacillus adhesion to gastric tissue. From the survival and adhesion data it seems feasible to obtain elevated levels of viable Lactobacillus sp. in human intestine by careful selection of the bacterial strains ingested. Furthermore, the in vitro methods used here should be valuable to screen potential strains. The data presented here can then be correlated with human in vivo studies monitoring the beneficial effect of ingestion of these Lactobacillus.
TI  - Poultry offal ensiled with lactobacillus acidophilus for growing and finishing swine diets.
AB  - Poultry offal (heads, feet, viscera) from a broiler processing plant was ground and mixed with corn, dried molasses and a Lactobacillus acidophilus culture. Fermentation was shown to be effective in batch sizes of 3.8, 75.7 and 208.1 liters, as well as a 1,360-kg silo. It was generally complete at 72 h. In trial 1, rats were fed silage mixtures of 60:30:5:5, 45:45:5:5 and 30:60:5:5, offal, corn, molasses and inoculant, respectively. Rats did not gain as well when fed the silage diets (P less than .05) as when fed the basal diet; however, the ranking of silages was 45:45, 60:30 and 30:60, offal-to-corn ratio for rat daily gains and feed conversions. In trial 2, growing-finishing pigs were fed the 60:30:5:5 silage at rates of 0, 10, 20 and 30% of the diet. Average daily gains and feed-to-gain ratios were not affected by including offal silage at up to 20% of the diet, but 30% offal silage in diets resulted in depressed gains (P less than .05) and increased feed-to-gain ratios. Carcasses were not different among treatments for dressing percentage, length, average backfat and percentage of ham, loin, shoulder, lean cuts and primal cuts. Carcasses from pigs fed 20 and 30% offal silage had significantly darker and firmer loin-eyes than those from control fed pigs. Marbling was higher (P less than .05) in loin-eyes from pigs fed 30% offal silage as compared with those from pigs fed 0% offal silage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Sequence and functional analysis of a divergent promoter from a cryptic plasmid of Lactobacillus acidophilus 168 S.
AB  - We have characterized three of at least five plasmids borne by Lactobacillus acidophilus 168 S. Restriction mapping indicates extensive sequence homology between at least two of them (p1 and p3). We have cloned them in Escherichia coli, and for the smallest (p1) we present the sequence of a region with two divergently arranged promoters which probably share a symmetrical (TTTAAA)-35 box and function efficiently in E. coli cells; an open reading frame contiguous to the promoter, which codes for a 120 amino acid protein of unknown function, and is transcribed in E. coli; and a transcription termination sequence next to this open reading frame. The promoter region contains an AT cluster which is similar to that of the ori2 region of the E. coli F plasmid, and is probably involved in the control of the replication of p1.
TI  - Multisubstrate analogs for deoxynucleoside kinases. Triphosphate end products and synthetic bisubstrate analogs exhibit identical modes of binding and are useful probes for distinguishing kinetic mechanisms.
AB  - Comparative inhibition kinetics with natural dNTP end products (dNp3) and new synthetic bisubstrate-type analogs, dNp4A (deoxynucleoside 5'-adenosine 5'''-P1,P4-tetraphosphate), have been studied with their target deoxynucleoside kinases from Lactobacillus acidophilus. Analysis of inhibition specificity, inhibition patterns, and Ki(app) under various conditions has revealed the following conclusions. Both dNTP and dNp4A bind to the active site of the corresponding kinase through multiple binding determinants. The deoxynucleoside moiety of dNTP fits optimally at the deoxynucleoside binding site and provides the basis for its inhibition specificity, whereas the triphosphate group interacts with the ATP binding site, reinforcing the affinity of the molecule as a potent end product inhibitor (Ki = 0.4-3 microM). The adenosine moiety of dNp4A does not contribute to the binding of this compound, whereas the tetraphosphate portion is the second binding determinant, just as in the model developed for dNTP. dNTP and dNp4A proved to be useful tools for distinguishing the kinetic mechanisms of kinases which follow sequential pathways, i.e. the rapid equilibrium Random Bi Bi for dCyd and dGuo kinases and the steady state Ordered Bi Bi mechanism for two dAdo kinases associated either with dCyd kinase or with dGuo kinase on different multifunctional proteins.
TI  - Lack of effect of Lactobacillus on gastrointestinal bacterial colonization in premature infants.
AB  - Studies were carried out on premature infants in the neonatal intensive care unit to determine the effect of feeding of lactobacilli on colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by antibiotic-resistant gram-negative enteric organisms. Thirty premature infants were matched by birth weight and gestational age, randomized and fed double blind either lactobacilli-containing formula or non-lactobacilli-containing formula within 72 hours of delivery. The two study groups were screened weekly by culture for stool lactobacilli, for gram-negative bacteria and for antibiotic resistance of these bacteria. Lactobacilli were cultured from the stools of 13 of 15 patients receiving lactobacilli and from 3 of 15 patients not receiving lactobacilli (P less than 0.001). Gram-negative enteric organisms were isolated during 40 of the 86 weeks (47%) of hospitalization for patients receiving lactobacilli and during 28 of 57 weeks (49%) for patients not receiving lactobacilli. There was no significant difference between the study groups in the number of resistant organisms or in the proportion of resistant organisms per gram-negative enteric isolates (4 of 40 vs. 0 of 28). These results suggest that facultative gram-negative enteric bacterial colonization, with either total or aminoglycoside-resistant strains, is not decreased by oral feedings of Lactobacillus acidophilus in premature infants.
TI  - Influence of mastitis on growth of starter organisms used for the manufacture of  fermented milks.

AB  - In a French case-control study of 1,010 breast cancer cases and 1,950 controls with nonmalignant diseases, the risk of breast cancer was found to be positively associated with frequency of cheese consumption and the level of fat in the milk consumed. A negative association was found between frequency of yogurt consumption and the risk of breast cancer. No association was found between the consumption of butter and the risk of breast cancer. The positive association between a daily consumption of alcohol and the risk of breast cancer previously reported was not altered when dairy produce consumption was taken into account.
TI  - Genetic transformation of rifampicin resistance in Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus strain 100-33, originally isolated from swine faeces, was transformed to rifampicin resistance with DNA from spontaneous rifampicin-resistant mutants derived from it. Cells of the recipient strain were treated with lysozyme and mutanolysin, mixed with donor DNA and polyethylene glycol and grown on a regeneration medium overnight. After 48 h incubation, the numbers of rifampicin-resistant cells in the populations of regenerated cells were estimated from numbers of colonies. Efficiency of the lysozyme/mutanolysin treatment (the ratio of the number of osmotically fragile cells after the enzyme treatment to the initial cell number) was about 99%. The regeneration frequency of the enzyme-treated cells varied from 5 to 67%. The transformation frequency varied from about 0.2 X 10(-8) to 8.0 X 10(-8) transformants per regenerated cell per microgram DNA. To our knowledge, this method for genetic transformation is the first to be reported for a Lactobacillus strain.
TI  - Fermentation of aqueous plant seed extracts by lactic Acid bacteria.
AB  - The effects of lactic acid bacterial fermentation on chemical and physical changes in aqueous extracts of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), peanut (Arachis hypogea), soybean (Glycine max), and sorghum (Sorghum vulgare) were studied. The bacteria investigated were Lactobacillus helveticus, L. delbrueckii, L. casei, L. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. Organisms were inoculated individually into all of the seed extracts; L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus were also evaluated together as inocula for fermenting the legume extracts. During fermentation, bacterial population and changes in titratable acidity, pH, viscosity, and color were measured over a 72-h period at 37 degrees C. Maximum bacterial populations, titratable acidity, pH, and viscosity varied depending upon the type of extract and bacterial strain. The maximum population of each organism was influenced by fermentable carbohydrates, which, in turn, influenced acid production and change in pH. Change in viscosity was correlated with the amount of protein and titratable acidity of products. Color was affected by pasteurization treatment and fermentation as well as the source of extract. In the extracts inoculated simultaneously with L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus, a synergistic effect resulted in increased bacterial populations, titratable acidity, and viscosity, and decreased pH in all the legume extracts when compared to the extracts fermented with either of these organisms individually. Fermented extracts offer potential as substitutes for cultured dairy products.
TI  - [Effect of antibiotics on the adhesive properties of microorganisms and an available model for its study].
AB  - The effect of benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, bicillin-3, carbenicillin, levomycetin, erythromycin, streptomycin and kanamycin on the adhesive properties of 9 test microbes including 5 strains of Lactobacillus from human microflora, 3 uropathornic strains of E. coli and 1 strain of S. aureus was studied with the method developed by the authors. The method is based on the use of formalinized human erythrocytes as macroorganism cells. It was shown that the antibiotic inhibitory effect on adhesion depended on mechanism of action of the antibiotics and their concentration, was associated with the level of the microbial adhesion and did not depend on the microbial sensitivity to the drugs.
TI  - Transport and metabolism of lactose, glucose, and galactose in homofermentative lactobacilli.
AB  - A number of species of lactobacilli were examined for their ability to ferment both the glucose and galactose moieties of lactose. Lactobacillus helveticus strains metabolized both the glucose and galactose moieties, whereas L. bulgaricus, L. lactis, and L. acidophilus strains metabolized only the glucose moiety and released galactose into the growth medium. All four species tested contained beta-galactosidase activity, and no significant phospho-beta-galactosidase activity was observed. L. bulgaricus and L. helveticus had a phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP):glucose phosphotransferase system for the uptake of glucose, but no evidence for a PEP:lactose phosphotransferase or PEP:galactose phosphotransferase system was obtained.
TI  - Immunotherapeutic effect of the lactobacillus vaccine, Solco Trichovac, in trichomoniasis is not mediated by antibodies cross reacting with Trichomonas vaginalis.
AB  - According to the producers of the lactobacillus vaccine, Solco Trichovac, its therapeutic effect in trichomoniasis is achieved by antibodies that are induced by the vaccination and cross react with Trichomonas vaginalis. Common antigens of Lactobacillus acidophilus from Solco Trichovac vaccine and T vaginalis were therefore sought by three different seroreactions. Immune serum against Lacidophilus obtained by vaccinating two healthy human volunteers and two rabbits with the original Solco Trichovac vaccine, as well as hyperimmune rabbit antiserum to T vaginalis, were tested with each of the two micro-organisms. No evidence of antigenic similarity between L acidophilus and T vaginalis was obtained with either serum in any of the three serological tests. A non-specific immunostimulatory effect therefore seems to be a more probable explanation of the mode of action of Solco Trichovac vaccine.
TI  - [Modification of intestinal colonization and translocation of Campylobacter jejuni by erythromycin and an extract of Lactobacillus acidophilus in axenic mice].
AB  - Erythromycin (15 mg) or lyophylized heat-killed Lactobacillus acidophilus (80 mg) were administered per os daily in germ-free mice infected at day O with 10(7)-10(8) Campylobacter jejuni per os. Bacterial colonization of intestine and bacterial translocation of C. jejuni toward mesenteric lymph nodes, blood and liver were then studied for 5 days. The results were compared with those from an infected untreated control group. Compared to the control group, the numbers of free and mucosa-associated bacteria decreased at day 5 in the erythromycin-treated group and the number of mucosa-associated bacteria was reduced from day 1 to day 5 in the Lactobacillus-treated group. Both treatments reduced the frequency of bacterial translocation toward mesenteric lymph nodes from day 1 to day 5. We concluded that both erythromycin and heat-killed L. acidophilus are effective in treating Campylobacter infection in mice, though probably through different mechanisms.
TI  - [Interference of the intestinal ecosystem of mice in the oral administration of lyophilized live bacteria].
AB  - Oral vaccines mode by living or killed bacteria are commonly used to restore normal intestinal flora; it's not well know, however, which bacteria play the leading part in this ecosystem. In the present paper Authors have intended to compare the effectiveness of an oral vaccine, made by Bifidobacterium bifidus and Lactobacillus acidofilus, with another of similar use, made by Enterococci, to increase the mouse resistance to lethal Salmonella enteritidis infections. According to collected microbiological data and M.E.S. photos, the association Bifidob./Lactobac. is more effective than Enterococci to enhance resistance to the experimental infection.

We compared the effect of the oral treatment with a lyophilized preparation of heat-killed Lactobacillus acidophilus and with sterile water on the mortality rate of newborn mice. In six out of seven assays, the heat-killed L. acidophilus administration extended survival of infected suckling mice (P ranging from 0.019 to less than 0.001). In another test, result was contradictory. A global analysis indicated that the two treatments were statistically different (P less than 0.001). Lactic acid was unable to induce protection.
TI  - Bengt E. Gustafsson memorial lecture. Function of the normal human microflora.
AB  - The normal human microflora maintains a delicate balance between its constituent  parts, numbering 10(11) bacteria per gram with over 400 different species. Certain metabolic functions and enzyme activities can be attributed to the microflora, and these play a role in metabolizing nutrients, vitamins, drugs, endogenous hormones and carcinogens. Our laboratory has studied estrogen and cholesterol metabolism and activation of colon carcinogens. Three techniques to change the flora and its enzymatic activities have been used. Switching the diet from an omnivore diet to a vegetarian diet decreases bacterial deconjugating enzymes in the intestine. Administering antibiotics also suppresses the metabolic activity of the microflora. Similar suppressive effects can be achieved by feeding a human strain of Lactobacillus that implants in the gastrointestinal tract. Manipulation of these various modalities can maximize the beneficial activities of the intestinal microflora.

TI  - Effects of Lactobacillus casei on Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in normal and  dexamethasone-treated mice.
AB  - A single intraperitoneal injection of Lactobacillus casei YIT 0003 into normal or dexamethasone-treated mice led to nonspecific resistance against intraperitoneal challenge with lethal doses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO 3047. The enhanced resistance was retained for 14 days (P less than 0.05) after injection with living L. casei. In contrast, the statistically significant duration of the enhanced resistance in mice treated intraperitoneally with living L. acidophilus YIT 0075 was only 5 days. The in vivo killing activity of peritoneal exudate cells (PECs) against P. aeruginosa 5 and 7 days after intraperitoneal injection of living L. casei was significantly higher than in the case of PECs elicited by L. acidophilus. In the case of intravenous injection of heat-killed L. casei before intraperitoneal challenge with P. aeruginosa, there were no survivors in the late period after administration of L. casei. A high correlation existed between the patterns of in vivo killing of P. aeruginosa by PECs and survival rate of mice injected intravenously with heat-killed L. casei. The reduced in vivo killing activity of PECs from dexamethasone-treated mice against P. aeruginosa infection was also augmented by the intraperitoneal injection of heat-killed L. casei. These results indicate that L. casei possesses a resistance-enhancing capacity against P. aeruginosa infection in vivo. Differences in the duration of the enhanced resistance caused by L. casei and by L. acidophilus may be due to differences in chemical composition and/or physicochemical properties of the cell walls of the two kinds of bacteria.

A sensitivity of the procedure was as little as 0.25 micrograms DNA per ml. At the DNA concentration 0.25-10 micrograms/ml growth of the indicator strain of bacteria exhibited the linear shape. As shown by means of the procedure developed one rat leukocyte contained 6.3 +/- 0.6 X 10(-12) g of DNA.
TI  - Metabolism of some drugs by intestinal lactobacilli and their toxicological considerations.
AB  - The bacterial metabolism of three drugs (sulphasalazine, phthalylsulphathiazole and chloramphenicol palmitate) and two dyes (tartrazine and methyl red) has been studied using a resting culture technique. The strains used were isolated intestinal lactobacilli, E. coli and mixed cultures of faeces of mice. As high as 94.3% degradation of sulphasalazine was found with a strain of Lactobacillus acidophilus. The highest degradation of phthalylsulphathiazole and chloramphenicol palmitate was found to be 17.6% and 8%, respectively. A kinetic study was conducted on the rate of degradation of sulphasalazine, phthalylsulphathiazole and methyl red. The toxicological aspects of degradation products in relation to the use of lactobacilli as dietary supplement or therapeutic aid are discussed.

AB  - Because of the reported use of yogurt douches for the treatment of vaginitis, the adherence of Lactobacillus species to normal human vaginal epithelial cells was tested by in vitro methods. L. acidophilus and L. bulgaricus isolated from three commercial yogurts were compared to L. acidophilus, L. fermentum, L. cellobiosus, and L. casei isolated from clinical specimens and from American Type Culture Collection cultures. L. acidophilus isolated from Lactinex tablets was also tested. No significant difference was found among the 19 clinical isolates, the American Type Culture Collection cultures, and the Lactinex isolate, but all showed significantly higher (p less than 0.01) adherence than any Lactobacillus isolated from yogurt. The presence of Gardnerella vaginalis, which adheres strongly to vaginal epithelial cells, was found to interfere with the adherence of lactobacilli from all sources studied.
TI  - Further studies on thymidine kinase: distribution pattern of the enzyme in bacteria.
AB  - Various micro-organisms (131 strains of 73 species) were studied for their ability to produce thymidine kinase (TK; EC 2.7.1.21). Taking the specific TK activity of Escherichia coli K12 [specific activity of sonicated cell extracts 95-194 pmol min-1 (mg protein)-1] as 100%, the test organisms had the following relative specific TK activities. In the Gram-positive cocci, Staphylococcus aureus (21-84%) showed higher activity than Staph. epidermidis (1-20%) and Streptococcus (1-7%) except for one strain of Strep. pyogenes (29%). Neisseria sicca, a Gram-negative coccus, lacked TK. Gram-positive endospore-forming rods showed significant activity (Bacillus, 13-51%; Clostridium perfringens, 9-18%) except for one strain of B. megaterium (2%) and C. difficile (1-3%). Among the Gram-positive asporogenous rods, Listeria monocytogenes and six species of Lactobacillus (especially L. brevis, L. buchneri and L. casei) had moderate to high activity (23-348%) but L. acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. lactis and L. cellobiosus had low activity (0-8%). Of the species of Pseudomonas studied, most lacked TK but Ps. fluorescens and Ps. maltophilia had significant TK activity (15-53%). Of the Gram-negative facultative anaerobes, Vibrio lacked TK, while Enterobacteriaceae, including Salmonella (148-1120%), Escherichia (59-141%), Klebsiella (78-299%) and Serratia (61-110%), had a high activity. Proteus had a somewhat lower activity (0-34%) except for 'Pr. rettgerella' (307%). Propionibacterium and Bifidobacterium and related organisms other than Streptomyces, Nocardia, Rhodococcus, Corynebacterium and Mycobacterium lacked TK. The seven species of Candida tested, and Cryptococcus neoformans, essentially lacked TK.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Multisubstrate analogs for deoxynucleoside kinases. Use in novel affinity media applied to resolution of Lactobacillus enzymes.
AB  - New multisubstrate-type inhibitors of the deoxynucleoside kinases have been synthesized, tested for their specificity as soluble inhibitors of enzymes from Lactobacillus acidophilus, and used to construct media for affinity chromatography. Each inhibitor was a deoxynucleoside 5'-adenosine 5"'-P1,P4-tetraphosphate (abbreviated dNp4A, where dN represents a dAdo, dCyd, dGuo, or dThd moiety linked through its 5'-hydroxyl to the terminal phosphate of adenosine tetraphosphate). At micromolar concentrations, each inhibitor strongly and specifically inhibited the corresponding deoxynucleoside kinase. Each of the four Lactobacillus deoxynucleoside kinase activities was selectively retained on its homologous dNp4A-Sepharose affinity medium. The activity was eluted on addition of the respective dNp4A with up to 70% recovery and 300-500-fold purification (relative to an ammonium sulfate fraction). Whereas dThd kinase was retained only by the dTp4A column, a portion of the dAdo kinase activity was retained, along with all the dCyd kinase or dGuo kinase, on dCp4A- or dGp4A-Sepharose, respectively, and coeluted with these activities. Conversely, all three activities were quantitatively retained on dAp4A-Sepharose, without competition from either dCyd or dGuo, and were eluted simultaneously upon addition of dAp4A. These observations further confirm the understanding that this organism employs paired, and presumably bifunctional, kinases, namely dCyd/dAdo kinase and dGuo/dAdo kinase, along with a separate thymidine kinase.
TI  - Influence of realimentation diet on recovery of rumen activity and feed intake in beef steers.
AB  - Two trials were conducted to determine the influence of realimentation diet energy, protein, B-vitamin (BV) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (LAC) content on recovery of rumen activity and feed consumption in beef steers. In trial 1, ruminal-fistulated steers were fasted and refed 1) prairie hay, 2) 10% protein (LCP), 3) 12.5% protein (MCP), 4) LCP + BV or 5) LCP + LAC. In trial 2, calves were fasted and refed 1) 60% cottonseed hulls-40% alfalfa dehy (high roughage), 2) LCP, 3) 15% protein (HCP), 4) LCP + BV or 5) LCP + LAC. Rumen fermentative capacity declined 74% (P less than .05) during feed and water deprivation, but returned to control levels by d 7 of realimentation. On d 3 of realimentation, steers fed the LCP and MCP diets had molar proportions of ruminal butyrate in excess of 35%. Steers fed the hay, LAC and BV diets did not have a high butyrate fermentation. In trial 2, calves lost about 15% of their body weight during feed and water deprivation. Calves fed the high roughage diet appeared to return to prefast feed and energy intakes more slowly than steers fed the medium roughage diets. Results of this study indicate that rumen fermentative capacity is a factor limiting feed intake in fasted calves for 7 to 14 after the reintroduction of feed and water.
TI  - Electrochemical classification of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Intestinal bacteria were classified as gram-positive or gram-negative by an electrode system with a basal plane pyrolytic graphite electrode and a porous nitrocellulose membrane filter to trap bacteria. When the potential of the graphite electrode was run in the range of 0 to 1.0 V versus the saturated calomel electrode (SCE), gram-positive bacteria gave peak currents at 0.65 to 0.69 V versus the SCE. The peak potentials of gram-negative bacteria were 0.70 to 0.74 V versus the SCE. Gram-negative bacteria and gram-positive bacteria were also classified based on the ratio of the second peak current to the first peak current when the potential cycle was repeated twice. The numbers of cells on the membrane filter were determined from the peak currents. It was found that the peak currents result from the electrochemical oxidation of coenzyme A in the cells of Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus acidophilus.

AB  - The chicken digestive tract is mainly colonized by bacteria belonging to the Lactobacillus genus. One of these strains (LEM-207) isolated from the crop of a cock and closely resembling L. acidophilus, was able to develop on a carbohydrate-free medium. Production of carbon dioxide and synthesis of tyramine, putrescine and cadaverine were observed in the cultures. Once implanted in the crops of germ-free chickens, strain LEM-207 led to the formation of amines. In germ-free (axenic) animals, only endogenous tyramine was detected, whereas in monoassociated chickens, we found a production of tyramine, cadaverine and putrescine. The concentrations of cadaverine and putrescine decreased with increasing acidification of the contents, whereas the level of tyramine increased (7-fold higher level than in germ-free chicken). Amine production was not detected in the caeca. The toxicological aspects of tyramine production in terms of the animal are discussed.
TI  - Immunoelectron microscopic studies on the localization of peptidoglycan peptide subunit pentapeptides in bacterial cell walls.
AB  - The peptide subunit pentapeptide H-L-Ala-D-Glu(L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala-OH)-NH2 of peptidoglycan was localized in the cell walls of several Gram-positive bacteria employing the indirect immunoferritin technique. Specific antibodies to the D-alanyl-D-alanine moiety of non-crosslinked peptide subunit pentapeptide were raised in rabbits by immunization with synthetic immunogen albumin-(CH2CO-Gly-L-Ala-L-Ala-D-Ala-D-Ala-OH)39. Specificity of these antibodies for the peptide subunit pentapeptide and not for the peptide subunit tetrapeptide was corroborated in a Farr-type radio-active hapten binding assay. Specificity of labelling with ferritin was established by immunoelectron microscopic controls, and by the excellent correlation between specific labelling of cells with ferritin and the particular peptidoglycan primary structure of bacterial strains investigated. Cells of Lactobacillus gasseri, Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus revealing non-crosslinked peptide subunit pentapeptides in their peptidoglycans could specifically be labelled. Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bacillus subtilis, on the contrary, missing such pentapeptides, failed in labelling. The implication of this method to possibly localize the points of attack of penicillin or cycloserine is discussed.
TI  - Effect of additive on alfalfa silage fermentation characteristics and feedlot performance of steers.
AB  - In each of two trials four large plastic bags were filled with approximately 72 mt of first cutting, early bloom alfalfa (35% dry matter). Fresh alfalfa in two bags was treated with .5 kg/metric ton of a commercial silage additive (Silo-Best). Two bags were left untreated. When compared with steers fed untreated alfalfa silage, weight gains, intakes, and feed efficiencies were not significantly (P greater than .05) altered for steers fed treated silage. However, laboratory analysis showed silage treatment increased in vitro dry matter digestibility (57.0 versus 60.6%) and decreased silage pH (4.98 versus 4.83). Concentrations of propionic and butyric acid were decreased by the additive. Data suggest that anaerobic fermentation was enhanced with the additive. Slight but significant improvements of silage in vitro dry matter digestibility, obtained by treating alfalfa silage with the inoculant-type preservative, did not result in improved performance in feeding trials.

AB  - Thirty-four strains of Gardnerella vaginalis were studied. They were isolated from non specific vaginitis. A presumptive identification can be based on colonial morphology, Gram stain characteristics, negative catalase and oxidase test. The differentiation of Gardnerella vaginalis from other negative catalase coccobacilli is based on the acid formation of carbohydrates, enzymatic test, analysis of short chain volatile and non volatile end products of fermentation in GLC. All Gardnerella strains produce acid from glucose, maltose, starch and are hippurate and alpha glucosidase positive. They are sulfonamide resistant, acetic, lactic and succinic acids are detected by gas liquid chromatography.
TI  - Nucleic acids of species of Lactobacillus.
AB  - Nucleic acid composition of 17 cultures representing the type or neotype strains  of 15 named Lactobacillus species was studied. Nucleic acid characterization of these isolates was accompanied by a comparative study of conventional phenotypic reactions. The overall guanine plus cytosine mean deoxyribonucleic acid base composition ranged from 33 to 50% and genome sizes varied between 700 and 1500 X 10(6) daltons. Sporolactobacillus inulinus contained 2500 X 10(6) daltons of chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid and was therefore similar in size to members of the genus Bacillus. Deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization at a temperature 15 degrees C below the thermal melting temperature confirmed the extreme molecular heterogeneity of many species. The genus can be divided into three major groups, each containing four or more species based on a combination of nucleic acid characteristics and conventional phenotypic reactions. Group I (33 to 39% guanine plus cytosine) contains Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus helveticus nov. ssp. jugurt, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Lactobacillus sanfrancisco. Group II (42 to 48% guanine plus cytosine contains Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus brevis, and Group III (48 to 50% guanine plus cytosine) contains Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. leichmanii, Lactobacillus fermentum, and Lactobacillus fermentum nov. ssp. cellobiosis.
TI  - Assimilation of cholesterol by Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Considerable variation was found among strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus isolated from the fecal flora of pigs with regard to the ability to grow well in the presence of bile and to assimilate cholesterol from a laboratory growth medium. The uptake of cholesterol occurred only when the culture(s) was growing in the presence of bile under anaerobic conditions. Consumption of L. acidophilus RP32, which was selected for its ability to grow well in the presence of bile and to assimilate cholesterol from the laboratory medium, significantly inhibited increases in serum cholesterol levels of pigs (P less than 0.05) fed a high-cholesterol diet. Consumption of L. acidophilus P47, which was selected for its ability to grow in the presence of bile and lack of ability to remove cholesterol from the growth medium, failed to have a similar effect. This indicates that certain strains of L. acidophilus act directly on cholesterol in the gastrointestinal tract, and thus may be beneficial in reducing serum cholesterol levels.
TI  - Effect of saccharin on growth and acid production of glucose-grown pathogenic and oral bacteria.
AB  - Growth and acid production of glucose-grown Gram-positive and Gram-negative rods  as well as cocci from the human oral cavity were studied in the presence of 0.02 to 20.00 mg/ml sodium saccharin. All Gram-positive rods, i.e. Actinomyces viscosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bacillus subtilis and Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and Gram-positive cocci, i.e. Streptococcus spp, Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus, were significantly inhibited by saccharin, especially at the higher concentrations. While Gram-negative cocci, i.e. Veillonella sp and Neisseria sicca were strongly inhibited by all tested saccharin concentrations, Gram-negative rods, i.e. the enterics and Acinetobacter sp, exhibited little if any inhibition. Saccharin caused a significant reduction in fermentative acid production congruent with observed growth.
TI  - Reverse effect of gram-positive bacteria vs. gram-negative bacteria on adjuvant-induced arthritis in germfree rats.
AB  - Germfree (GF) F344 rats developed severe adjuvant-induced arthritis with a 100% incidence after a single intradermal injection of heat-killed Mycobacterium bovis (BCG). Specific pathogene-free (SPF) rats developed less severe arthritis with a lower incidence. The rats colonized with Escherichia coli or Bacteroides developed mild disease comparable to that in SPF rats. The rats colonized with Bifidobacterium, Propionibacterium acnes, Lactobacillus casei, L. fermentum, L. murini, and L. acidophilus developed more severe disease than that in GF rats. Furthermore, the rats colonized with a mixture of E. coli and the above lactobacilli developed very mild disease similar to that in SPF rats. These results suggest that gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli and Bacteroides, may suppress the disease, possibly through their lipopolysaccharides, and may be responsible for the lower susceptibility of SPF rats; gram-positive bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium, P. acnes, and lactobacilli, may enhance the disease, possibly through their peptidoglycans; and E. coli may play a dominant role in modulating the development of adjuvant-induced arthritis.
TI  - [Use of oral bacteria therapy in childhood during acute enteritis and functional  chronic diarrhea. Clinical experience].
AB  - There are some theoretical reasons to give an oral bacterial therapy when intestinal ecosystem changes its composition. The authors would verify the clinical effectiveness or oral bacterial therapy during acute and functional chronic diarrhea: even if the course of the illness doesn't become shorter, oral bacterial therapy moreover may be useful in reducing the risk of having casual carries of pathogenic agents and may restore an intestinal ecosystem previously modified by antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Distinct sites for deoxyguanosine and deoxyadenosine phosphorylation on a monomeric kinase from Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Base-line separation of two paired deoxynucleoside kinase activities (deoxycytidine/deoxyadenosine and deoxyguanosine/deoxyadenosine kinase), previously resolved as overlapping peaks from Blue Sepharose, has now been achieved. The improved separation and recovery in relatively small volumes were accomplished by eluting Blue Sepharose with a bisubstrate mixture: 0.5 mM dCyd plus 1 mM ATP released dCyd/dAdo kinase, and 1 mM dGuo plus 5 mM ATP eluted dGuo/dAdo kinase. The latter pair of activities showed copurification through UDP-Sepharose affinity chromatography and HPLC anion-exchange chromatography. The HPLC preparation appeared to be homogeneous, on the basis of nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at several gel concentrations and pH values. Both dGuo and dAdo kinase activities coincided with the protein band. A single band of protein was also observed upon sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. The estimated molecular weight of the denatured protein (56 000) agrees closely with values obtained for native activity by sedimentation equilibrium or gel permeation chromatography. The rate of dAdo phosphorylation was found to be stimulated more than 3-fold by the presence of dGuo, and dGuo kinase was also slightly activated by the presence of dAdo. This mutual activation indicates that dGuo and dAdo kinase activities do not share a common site. Selective chemical inactivation of dGuo kinase by 5'-[p-(fluorosulfonyl)benzoyl]adenosine eliminated the ability of dGuo to stimulate dAdo kinase in parallel with the loss of dGuo kinase activity. These lines of evidence strongly suggest that dGuo and dAdo kinase activities are functions of separate sites on a monomeric polypeptide and that these sites may be in allosteric communication.
TI  - Importance of bile tolerance of Lactobacillus acidophilus used as a dietary adjunct.
AB  - Cultures of lactobacilli identified as Lactobacillus acidophilus from the intestinal contents of young calves varied in their ability to grow in broth containing .3% oxgall compared with control broth. Frozen concentrated cultures were prepared from a strain exhibiting low tolerance to bile and from a strain exhibiting high tolerance to bile. Plate counts were comparable from the concentrated cultures before and after frozen storage on lactobacilli MRS agar with and without .15% oxgall. In a feeding trial involving newborn dairy calves supplementation of the diet with the more bile resistant strain of Lactobacillus acidophilus caused greater increases of numbers of facultative lactobabilli in the upper small intestines than did the strain exhibiting lower resistance to bile. It was not possible to determine whether the lactobacilli would prevent intestinal infections in the calves challenged with enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. This portion of the study failed as the challenge with Escherichia coli did not cause infections even in control animals.
TI  - Lactose malabsorption from yogurt, pasteurized yogurt, sweet acidophilus milk, and cultured milk in lactase-deficient individuals.
AB  - The use of fermented dairy foods is common in areas of the world where lactase deficiency is prevalent. Recently, we have shown that the digestion of lactose from yogurt is enhanced as compared to that from milk. This enhanced digestion is apparently due to inherent B-galactosidase in yogurt which is active in the gastrointestinal tract after consumption of the yogurt. Furthermore, yogurt is well tolerated by lactase-deficient subjects resulting in little or no gastrointestinal distress. Since other fermented and microbial-containing dairy foods are consumed worldwide and may also contain some "lactase" activity, we chose to evaluate the digestion of lactose from three of these products: pasteurized yogurt, cultured milk (buttermilk), and sweet acidophilus milk. Breath hydrogen techniques were used to evaluate lactose malabsorption in nine lactase-deficient subjects. The studies demonstrated that yogurt is unique among the products tested in enhancing the digestion of lactose. Furthermore, pasteurization of yogurt eliminated the enhanced digestion of lactose, reduced the inherent lactase activity of the yogurt by 10-fold and reduced cell counts by 100-fold. Interestingly, eight of nine subjects fed cultured milk experienced gastrointestinal distress, whereas all subjects fed pasteurized yogurt were symptom free, even though the amount of malabsorbed lactose was similar.

TI  - Antimicrobic effects of Lactobacillus fermentation on edible waste material contaminated with infected carcasses.
AB  - Survival of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and Salmonella enteritidis serovar typhimurium (introduced as infected carcasses) in Lactobacillus-fermented edible waste material was studied to determine the ability of the fermentation to activate disease agents in carcasses. Two trials were conducted. In the 1st trial, the fermented wastes contained 20% infected carcasses (protein) consisting of equal numbers of chicken (NDV) and rat (Salmonella) carcasses, and the 2nd trial contained 40% carcasses (protein). Mixtures were incubated at 20 C, 30 C, and 40 C for 216 hours. Samples were obtained daily for quantitative virus and bacterial isolation. Temperature, pH, and redox potential were monitored. In both trials, pH and redox potential changes occurred between 24 and 48 hours depending on the incubation temperature. In both trials, NDV survived 4 days at 20 C, 2 days at 30 C, and 1 day at 40 C. Salmonella enteritidis serovar typhimurium survived 5 days at 20 C, 1 day at 30 C, and was not isolated from the 40 C samples after 24 hours in both trials.
TI  - Colonization of a human intestine by four different genotypes of Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - To understand the effect on a human host suffering from intestinal disorders we supplied non fat milk cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus for 25 days. The picture of the faeces bacterial count was completely different before and after treatment and we noticed increases in lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and coliforms while the clostridia decreased. The lactobacilli treatment solved the diarrohea problem. Of the four genetic lines of L. acidophilus supplied only D179, isolated from calf faeces, and ATCC 4356 of human origin were found able to colonize the intestine of the little girl, while 255S isolated from swine and D328 isolated from calf faeces, did not find favourable growth conditions.
TI  - [Isolation, assay and biotyping of lactobacillary flora of the vagina].
AB  - The results of the isolation, quantitation and biotyping of 120 strains of vaginal Lactobacillus are presented. The more effective culture media for isolation and different methods of pH measurement were investigated. Five different species of Lactobacillus were isolated in vaginal specimens (Lactobacillus acidophilus 88.8%). The size limits found in the 120 Lactobacillus acidophilus strains were 0.8 to 6,0 mu length and 0.3 to 0.8 mu width. The effort to correlate number of Lactobacillus to pH and weight of vaginal fluid did not give satisfactory results because of difficulties in collecting homogeneous samples. Biochemical investigation of 120 vaginal strains of Lactobacillus did not show any peculiar biotype. The A.A. suggested the "routine" detection of vaginal lactobacillar flora as a usefull marker of ecological status in the choice of the therapy.
TI  - Purification and characterization of the Lactobacillus acidophilus bacteriocin lactacin B.
AB  - Parameters for production and purification of a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus N2 are described. Production of lactacin B was pH dependent, with maximum activity detected in broth cultures maintained at pH 6. Lactacin B was purified by ion-exchange chromatography, ultrafiltration, and successive gel filtrations in the presence of 8 M urea and then 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. The molecular weight of lactacin B was ca. 6,000 to 6,500, and the purified compound showed maximum absorbance at 211 nm. The activity of purified lactacin B was bactericidal to sensitive cells and restricted to members of the family Lactobacilliaceae, L. leichmannii, L. bulgaricus, L. helveticus, and L. lactis. Characteristics identified for lactacin B indicated that it was a peptide and confirmed its identity as a bacteriocin.

TI  - Alterations of the intestinal microflora by diet, oral antibiotics, and Lactobacillus: decreased production of free amines from aromatic nitro compounds, azo dyes, and glucuronides.
AB  - F344 rats were fed compounds containing a nitro, azo, or amine-glucuronide group-2-nitronaphthalene (CAS: 581-89-5), 2-nitrofluorene (CAS: 607-57-8; 2-nitro-9H-fluorene), 4-phenylazo-2-naphthol (CAS: 6410-10-2; 1-[(4-nitrophenyl)azo]-2-naphthol), and 2-naphthylamine-N-D-glucuronide--and the formation of free amines was measured in the feces. The effects of diet (mean vs. grain), administration of antibiotic, and the feeding of Lactobacillus acidophilus were evaluated. Meat-fed rats given 2-nitronaphthalene had approximately 4 times higher concentration of free amines in their feces as compared to the concentration in grain-fed rats. In a similar experiment with 2-naphthylamine-N-D-glucuronide, the meat-fed animals had approximately 1.5 times more of the free amines and 50% less of the conjugates in their feces. When meat-fed animals were given L. acidophilus with 2-nitrofluorene or 2-naphthylamine-N-D-glucuronide, they had significantly lower free amines and higher concentrations of conjugates in their feces than did the meat-fed controls. Similarly, erythromycin or tetracycline decreased the fecal amine production in meat-fed animals that had received 2-nitrofluorene or 4-phenylazo-2-naphthol. In another experiment, erythromycin inhibited the production of free amines from 2-naphthylamine-N-D-glucuronide in rats fed a high-fat diet. Studies of fecal enzymes revealed lower levels of beta-D-glucuronidase, nitroreductase, and azoreductase in grain-fed rats and in meat-fed animals also given antibiotics or lactobacilli. These experiments showed that intestinal flora have the ability to convert exogenously administered aromatic nitro and azo compounds and an amine-glucuronide compound to free amines. The rate of these conversions was affected by diet and by oral administration of antibiotics and lactobacilli.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of an aminopeptidase from Lactobacillus acidophilus R-26.
AB  - An intracellular aminopeptidase (alpha-aminoacyl-peptide hydrolase (cytosol), EC  3.4.11.1) isolated from cell extracts of Lactobacillus acidophilus R-26 was purified 634-fold to homogeneity. This enzyme, which was responsible for all of the N-terminal exopeptidase and amidase activities observed in crude extracts, had no detectable endopeptidase or esterase activity. Although a broad range of L-amino acid peptide, amide and p-nitroanilide derivatives possessing free alpha-amino termini are attacked, the enzyme favored substrates with hydrophobic N-terminal R groups. The native enzyme, which was found to be a tetramer of molecular weight 156000, contained 4 mol of tightly bound Zn2+. The catalytically inactive native zinc metalloenzyme was capable of being activated by either Zn2+, Co2+, Ni2+ or Mn2+. The shape of the log Vmax versus pH plot indicates that two active-center ionizable groups (pKES1 = 5.80; pKES2 = 8.00) may be involved in catalysis. Methylene-blue-sensitized photooxidation of the enzyme resulted in the complete loss of activity, while L-leucine, a competitive inhibitor, partially protected against this inactivation. Amino-acid analysis indicated that this photooxidative loss of activity corresponds to the modification of one histidine residue per monomer of protein.

TI  - The effect of milk and lactobacillus feeding on human intestinal bacterial enzyme activity.
AB  - Twenty-one subjects were recruited for a study designed to investigate the effect of oral supplements of Lactobacillus acidophilus on fecal bacterial enzyme activity. Three bacterial enzymes were assayed: beta-glucuronidase, nitroreductase, and azoreductase. These fecal enzymes can catalyze procarcinogens conversion to a proximal carcinogen. The sequence of feeding studies and fecal enzyme assays was the same for all subjects: 4 wk of a control period; 4 wk of plain milk feeding; 4 wk of control, without any dietary supplements; 4 wk of milk containing 2 X 10(6) per ml viable L acidophilus; and 4 wk of control, without any supplements. The concentration of viable lactobacilli simulates that found in acidophilus supplemented milk. Reductions of 2- to 4-fold in the activities of the three fecal enzymes were observed only during the period of lactobacilli feeding. These changes were noted in all subjects and were highly significant (p less than 0.02 to 0.001). During the final control period, after lactobacilli feeding, fecal enzyme levels returned to normal after 4 wk.
TI  - Inactivation of Clostridium difficile cytotoxin by the neutrophil myeloperoxidase system.
AB  - The cytotoxin of Clostridium difficile was examined for sensitivity to oxidant secretory products of neutrophils. Exposure to myeloperoxidase, H2O2, and a halide resulted in loss of toxin activity measured by tissue-culture cytotoxicity. The peroxide requirement was provided by reagent H2O2, a peroxide-generating enzyme (glucose oxidase), or a peroxide-producing intestinal microorganism, Lactobacillus acidophilus. Human neutrophils stimulated by phorbol myristate acetate caused similar toxin inactivation. In both the cell-free and the neutrophil systems, inactivation of toxin required halides and was abrogated by azide, cyanide, or catalase. Neutrophils from patients with lack of myeloperoxidase or failure to produce H2O2 were impaired in toxin inactivation unless myeloperoxidase or H2O2, respectively, was added. The reducing agent 2-mercaptoethanol enhanced toxin activity. These data suggest a similarity between C difficile cytotoxin and the classic thiol-activated cytolysins. Moreover, they raise the possibility that neutrophils are involved in oxidative detoxification of microbial products.
TI  - The intestinal microflora of infants: composition of fecal flora in breast-fed and bottle-fed infants.
AB  - The fecal flora of 35 breast-fed and 35 bottle-fed babies was determined. Bifidobacteria were the predominant fecal bacteria in both groups. Conversely, the counts of most of the other bacteria, such as bacteroides, eubacteria, peptococci, veillonella, clostridia, enterobacteria, streptococci, and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. The frequencies of occurrence of lecithinase positive clostridia, clostridia-others, pseudomonas and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. Twenty-one genera and 103 species or biovars of microorganisms were isolated from the feces of the breast-fed group and 20 genera and 97 species or biovars from the bottle-fed group. The organism that showed the highest number and the highest frequency of occurrence in both groups was Bifidobacterium breve. Bifidobacterium infantis, which was formerly the most prevalent Bifidobacterium species in baby feces, was never isolated in this study. Further, the counts and incidences of Clostridium paraputrificum, C. perfringens, and Bacillus subtilis, the counts of C. clostridiiforme, Bacteroides vulgatus, Veillonella parvula, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus bovis, S. faecalis, and S. faecium and the incidences of C. difficile, C. tertium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the bottle-fed infants were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed infants.
TI  - [Adhesive properties of lactobacilli isolated from the human gastrointestinal tract].
AB  - The adhesive and hemagglutinating properties of 34 tribes of Lactobacillus have been examined. 21 tribes came from human saliva and feces. 23.5% of the tribes showed strongly, 50% weakly adhesive properties. The remaining tribes showed average effects. Most of the strongly adhering tribes were isolates from human specimens. In the group of weakly adhering tribes those from collections dominated. 4 of 9 examined species differed in their adhering capacity. These were L. acidophilus, L. salivarius, L. casei, and L. fermentum. Only weakly adhering tribes showed hemagglutination of human erythrocytes. Therefore, there exists obviously, a reversed relation between the adhering and the hemagglutinating properties of Lactobacilli.
TI  - [Acidophilus milk for therapy in gastrointestinal disorders].
AB  - A new developed Acidophilus milk has been introduced as therapy in different disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. The milk contains acid resistant tribes of L. acidophilus and is fortified with vitamins, its fat content is low. The passage of alive L. acidophilus could be proved. The preparation showed a clear response in patients suffering from intestinal disorders due to an application of antibiotics and in patients with constipations.
TI  - Production and properties of alpha-glucosidase from Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus IFO 3532 was found to produce only intracellular alpha-glucosidase (alpha-D-glucoside glucohydrolase; EC 3.2.1.20). Maximum enzyme production was obtained in a medium containing 2% maltose as inducer at 37 degrees C and at an initial pH of 6.5. The enzyme was formed in the cytoplasm and accumulated as a large pool during the logarithmic growth phase. Enzyme production was strongly inhibited by 4 microM CuSO4, 40 microM CoCl2, and beef extract; MnSO4 and the presence of proteose peptone and yeast extract in the medium greatly enhanced enzyme production. A 16.6-fold purification of alpha-glucosidase was achieved by (NH4)2SO4 fractionation and DEAE-cellulose column chromatography. The enzyme showed high specificity for maltose. The Km for alpha-p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside was 11.5 mM, and the Vmax for alpha-p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside hydrolysis was 12.99 mumol/min per mg of protein. The optimal pH and temperature for enzyme activity were 5.0 and 37 degrees C, respectively. The enzyme activity was inhibited by Hg2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Ca2+, Co2+, urea, rose bengal, and 2-iodoacetamide, whereas Mn2+, Mg2+, L-cysteine, L-histidine, Tris, and EDTA stimulated enzyme activity. Transglucosylase activity was present in the partially purified enzyme, and isomaltose was the only glucosyltransferase product. Amylase activity in the purified preparation was relatively weak, and no isomaltase activity was detected.
TI  - Amylase production by three Lactobacillus strains isolated from chicken crop.
AB  - Three amylolytic Lactobacillus strains designated LEM 220, LEM 207 and LEM 202 were isolated from the chicken crop. They belonged to the subgenus Thermobacterium. Strain LEM 220 resembled Lact. acidophilus. Amylase production was more abundant in cells grown in media containing amylopectin or starch than in media containing glucose or maltose. Optimum pH and temperature of the amylase were 5.5 and 55 degrees C respectively. Hydrolysis of amylopectin gave maltose, maltotriose and small amounts of glucose. Stain LEM 207 also resembled Lact. acidophilus, but differed from strain 220. It had a lower amylase activity. Optimum pH and temperature of the amylase were 6.4 and 40 degrees C, respectively, and hydrolysis of amylopectin gave maltose, maltotriose and carbohydrates higher than maltopentaose. Strain LEM 202 was similar to Lact. vitelinus. It had the lowest amylase activity which was increased only in presence of maltose. Amylase properties were similar to those of LEM 220.
TI  - [Use of adapted Maliutka and Malysh Propionibacterium acidophilus mixtures in the combined treatment of acute diseases of the gastrointestinal tract in infants].
AB  - The efficacy of the adapted sweet, acidophilic and propionic-acidophilic mixtures Malyutka and Malysh included into a complex of therapeutic measures for acute gastroenterocolitis was studied and compared in 93 infants. The time course of gastroenterocolitis was the most favourable in children fed the propionic-acidophilic mixtures Malyutka and Malysh. As compared to children given the sweet and acidophilic mixtures Malyutka and Malysh, those fed propionic-acidophilic versions of the mixtures demonstrated more rapid elimination of the major symptoms and syndromes of disease and improvement of erythropoiesis.

TI  - Colonization of Lactobacillus acidophilus in gnotobiotic chicks.
AB  - Germ-free chicks hatched in flexible film gnotobiotic isolators were dosed orally at 2 days of age with a pure culture of Lactobacillus acidophilus. The chicks monoassociated with L. acidophilus were killed at 2 weeks of age to obtain gastrointestinal tract specimens for histological sectioning. Both light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy were performed to determine colonization and adhesion of lactobacilli. This strain of L. acidophilus was found associated with epithelium from three segments of the gastrointestinal tract (crop, proventriculus, and duodenum) of the gnotobiotic chick. The electron micrographs showed not only a close relationship between the Lactobacillus organism and the crop epithelia, but also an attachment through physical contact.
TI  - The adherence of lactic acid bacteria to the columnar epithelial cells of pigs and calves.
AB  - The adhesion of various lactobacilli and streptococci to columnar epithelial cells of pigs and calves were studied, by in vitro methods. The porcine strains isolated most frequently were Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lact, acidophilus and Lact. fermentum. Thirteen of the 22 lactobacilli were adhesive. All the streptococci isolated belonged to Lancefield's D-group; none of them adhered to pig epithelial cells. The adhesive strains (9 of 22) of calves were identified as Lact. fermentum. Adherence was variable even between strains of the same species. Isolates from plant material, cultured milk and cheese did not adhere to the columnar epithelial cells in vitro. The adhesive porcine strains tolerated low pH and bile acids, which is important for their survival under conditions in the stomach and intestine.
TI  - Effect of oral dosing of Lactobacillus strains on gut colonization and liver biotin in broiler chicks.
AB  - Strains of host specific (KTM, 74/1, and 59) and nonhost specific (40) lactobacilli were orally dosed to day-old broiler chicks. Dose levels consisted of: 5.0, 7.0, and 9.0 log10 cfu/day for 21 days. Each treatment and control group (placebo, no culture) contained three replications of 6 chicks in Experiment 1 (strains 40 and KTM) and 7 chicks in Experiment 2 (strains 74/1 and 59). Dosing of 7.0 log10 cfu and above tended to depress chick growth. Fecal shedding of lactobacilli were the same (8.8 log10 cfu) for all dose levels on Day 5 but decreased on Day 14 for strains KTM and 40. For strains 74/1 and 59 at all dose levels, the fecal shedding of lactobacilli was 9.9 log10 cfu for Day 5 and 8.5 log10 cfu for Day 14. Microbiology was performed on contents of the crop and ileum and on the tissue macerates from the crop, ileum, and ceca from chicks killed on Days 7 and 21 of the experiments. Chicks dosed with strains 59 and KTM had lower numbers of coliforms in cecal macerates than the control and chicks dosed with strains 40 and 74/1. No significant differences were observed in lactobacilli found in contents and tissues between 5.0 and 9.0 log10 cfu for all lactobacilli strains dosed. There was a trend for the liver biotin to be higher in chicks dosed with 7.0 log10 cfu than chicks dosed with 5.0 or 9.0 log10 cfu or no culture, but the difference was not significant (P greater than .05).
TI  - Effect of Lactobacillus inoculation and antibiotic feeding of chickens on availability of dietary biotin.
AB  - Oral inoculation with Lactobacillus acidophilus and dietary supplementation with  antibiotics were compared in broiler chicks fed various levels of biotin to determine their effect on the biotin status of the chicks. Lactobacillus acidophilus inoculation of broiler chickens fed a diet marginally deficient in biotin (56 micrograms/kg) caused a significant decrease (P less than .01) in their liver biotin content from 1596 to 931 ng/g. The decrease biotin status was confirmed by significant increases (P less than .01) in 16:1 and 18:1 plasma fatty acids and significant decreases (P less than .01) in 18:0 and 20:4 omega 6 plasma fatty acids. These alterations in fatty acids were only observed when the samples were taken from chickens in the fed condition. Supplementation with Lactobacillus caused an increased incidence of foot dermatitis and decreased growth of chickens, presumably by competing with the chicken for dietary biotin. No significant changes were noted with antibiotic feeding.
TI  - Conjugal Transfer of Broad-Host-Range Plasmid pAMbeta1 into Enteric Species of Lactic Acid Bacteria.
AB  - The broad-host-range plasmid pAMbeta1, which codes for erythromycin and lincomycin resistance, was transferred by conjugation into Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus reuteri, and Lactobacillus salivarius. A novel 17-megadalton plasmid molecule was detected in the transconjugants, confirming the introduction of pAMbeta1 into each species.
TI  - Competitive gut exclusion of avian pathogens by Lactobacillus acidophilus in gnotobiotic chicks.
AB  - A total of 205 Grey Leghorn chicks were hatched germfree for separate trials to determine the effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus treatment on pathogenic Salmonella typhimurium and Staphlococcus aureus. Prophylactic and therapeutic treatments with L. acidophilus were administered either before or after the pathogens were introduced. Prophylactic treatments significantly reduced chick mortality (P less than .01) and shedding of the pathogens (P less than .05). The L. acidophilus prophylactic treatments were also effective qualitatively in reducing the isolation of S. typhimurium and Staph. aureus from crop contents but not, to a great extent, from cecal or rectal contents of gnotobiotic chicks at postmortem. The average surface pH values for the crop, proventriculus, duodenum, cecum, and rectum for gnotobiotic chicks were 5.43, 5.02, 6.18, 6.56, and 6.71, respectively. The L. acidophilus treatments did not significantly affect surface pH of the various segments of the intestinal tract.
TI  - Development and differences of intestinal flora in the neonatal period in breast-fed and bottle-fed infants.
AB  - The development of stool bacterial flora was studied in breast-fed and bottle-fed infants. In both groups of infants, the intestine was first colonized with enterobacteria and their number attained 10(9) per gram of feces. On day 6, bifidobacteria were the predominant organisms in the stool of breast-fed infants, exceeding enterobacteria by a ratio of 1,000:1, whereas enterobacteria were the predominant organisms in formula-fed infants, exceeding bifidobacteria by approximately 10:1. At 1 month of age, bifidobacteria were the most prevalent organisms in both groups but the number of these organisms in the stool of bottle-fed infants was approximately one tenth that of breast-fed infants. The properties of breast milk that promote the growth of bifidobacteria and suppress the growth of coliform and other potentially pathogenic organisms, theoretically, would help to minimize the incidence of neonatal diseases caused by these organisms. The results would support the advantages of breast-feeding for optimal care of newborn infants.
TI  - Viricidal effects of Lactobacillus and yeast fermentation.
AB  - The survival of selected viruses in Lactobacillus- and yeast-fermented edible waste material was studied to determine the feasibility of using this material as a livestock feed ingredient. Five viruses, including Newcastle disease virus, infectious canine hepatitis virus, a porcine picornavirus, frog virus 3, and bovine virus diarrhea, were inoculated into a mixture of ground food waste (collected from a school lunch program) containing Lactobacillus acidophilus. Mixtures were incubated at 20, 30, and 40 degrees C for 216 h. In a second trial, four viruses, including Newcastle disease virus, infectious canine hepatitis virus, frog virus 3, and a porcine picornavirus, were inoculated into similar edible waste material containing Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Mixtures were incubated at 20 and 30 degrees C for 216 h. Samples were obtained daily for quantitative (trial 1) and qualitative (trial 2) virus isolation. Temperature, pH, and redox potential were monitored. Controlled pH and temperature studies were also done and compared with the inactivation rates in the fermentation processes. In trial 1 (Lactobacillus fermentation), infectious canine hepatitis virus survived the entire test period in the fermentation process but was inactivated below pH 4.5 in the controlled studies. Newcastle disease virus was inactivated by day 8 in the fermentation process and appeared to be primarily heat sensitive and secondarily pH sensitive in the controlled studies. The porcine picornavirus survived the fermentation process for 8 days at 20 degrees C but was inactivated more rapidly at 30 and 40 degrees C. The controlled studies verified these findings. Frog virus 3 was inactivated by day 3 in the fermentation process and appeared to be sensitive to low pH in the controlled studies. Bovine virus diarrhea was rapidly inactivated in the fermentation process (less than 2 h) and was pH and temperature sensitive. In trial 2 (yeast fermentation), infectious hepatitis virus survived the entire test period in the fermentation process. Newcastle disease virus was inactivated by day 7 at 20 degrees C and day 6 at 30 degrees C. The porcine picornavirus was inactivated by day 7 at 30 degrees C but survived the entire test period at 20 degrees C. Frog virus 3 was inactivated by day 3 at 20 degrees C and day 2 at 30 degrees C.
TI  - Response of patients with irritable bowel syndrome and lactase deficiency using unfermented acidophilus milk.
AB  - Acidophilus milk has been reported to help patients with irritable bowel syndrome by correcting the "imbalance of flora" and to be tolerated better by lactase-deficient subjects by providing bacterial lactase in the small intestine. In a double-blind randomized study, 61 lactase-sufficient patients with irritable bowel syndrome each ingested 240 ml of milk three times a day for 2 wk and the same amount of acidophilus milk for an additional 2 wk. The degree of symptoms during the two milk-drinking periods was the same as during the control periods. Also, 18 lactase-deficient patients ingested unaltered milk for 1 wk and acidophilus milk for 1 additional wk. There was no difference in the degree of tolerance to the two varieties of milk. In summary, patients with irritable bowel syndrome were not helped by the ingestion of acidophilus milk, and lactase-deficient patients were as intolerant to acidophilus milk as to unaltered milk.
TI  - Detection and activity of lactacin B, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - A total of 52 strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus were examined for production of bacteriocins. A majority (63%) demonstrated inhibitory activity against all members of a four-species grouping of Lactobacillus leichmannii, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus helveticus, and Lactobacillus lactis. Four L. acidophilus strains with this activity also inhibited Streptococcus faecalis and Lactobacillus fermentum, suggesting a second system of antagonism. Under conditions eliminating the effects of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide, no inhibition of other gram-positive or -negative genera was demonstrated by L. acidophilus. The agent produced by L. acidophilus N2 and responsible for inhibition of L. leichmannii, L. bulgaricus, L. helveticus, and L. lactis was investigated. Ultrafiltration studies indicated a molecular weight of approximately 100,000 for the crude inhibitor. The agent was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and retained full activity after 60 min at 100 degrees C (pH 5). Activity against sensitive cells was bactericidal but not bacteriolytic. These characteristics identified the inhibitory agent as a bacteriocin, designated lactacin B. Examination of strains of L. acidophilus within the six homology groupings of Johnson et al. (Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 30:53-68, 1980) demonstrated that production of the bacteriocin lactacin B could not be used in classification of neotype L. acidophilus strains. However, the usefulness of employing sensitivity to lactacin B in classification of dairy lactobacilli is suggested.
TI  - [The effect of spermicides on physiological and pathogenic genital flora].
AB  - In vitro-studies concerning the influence of commercially available spermicides on lactobacillus acidophilus as well as on pathogenic organisms of the genital tract revealed, that the preparations had only weak antimicrobial effect on Doderlein's bacteria and pathogenic fungi. However, all four preparations tested, revealed a good inhibition effect on neisseria gonorrhoeae, treponema pallidum and trichomonas vaginalis. Irreversible damage to gonococci and trichomonas vaginalis. Irreversible damage to gonococci and trichomonas was subject to considerable variation, probably due to the different chemical composition of the commercially in Austria available spermicides.
TI  - [Long-term experience in the therapy and prevention of unspecific vaginal discharge with a Lactobacillus vaccine].
AB  - This report presents a study of 28 women with chronic non-specific vaginitis treated by Solco Trichovac, a vaccine containing at least 7 X 10(9) inactivated microorganisms of various strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus in each 0.5 ml dose. 3 injections were administered at 2-week intervals, and the results of therapy investigated with regard to quantitative increase in lactobacilli in the vaginal secretion, change in grade according to Schroder and reduction of the vaginal fluor. The vaccination caused a significant (p less than 0.01) quantitative increase in physiological lactobacilli. Accordingly, there was a significant improvement (p less than 0.01) in grade already 4 weeks after completion of the primary course of treatment. Re-examination after one year showed that nearly 80% of the patients were grade I to II; the vaginal fluor was clinically cured or at least markedly improved in 85.6% of cases. In our experience the vaccination presents a promising new concept of therapy and shows a special effect in patients with chronic non-specific vaginitis and with reduced Doderlein's vaginal bacillus due to restoration of the biological protective mechanisms.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus as a dietary adjunct for milk to aid lactose digestion  in humans.
AB  - The effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus on lactose utilization of humans was determined by our comparing the amount of hydrogen excreted in their breath after consuming milk containing either 0, 2.5 X 10(6), 2.5 X 10(7), or 2.5 X 10(8) Lactobacillus acidophilus/ml daily for 6 days. Consumption of milk without cells of Lactobacillus acidophilus for 1 wk did not affect lactose utilization. Milk containing either 2.5 X 10(6) or 2.5 X 10(8) Lactobacillus acidophilus/ml improved lactose utilization. However, consumption of milk containing an intermediate 2.5 X 10(7)/ml did not improve utilization based on comparison of group means before and after consuming the test milk. The lack of a significant effect for the latter group of test subjects was probably due to large increases of excreted hydrogen on day 7 as compared to day 0 by two of the six test subjects. The beneficial effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus was immediate and did not require that milk be consumed daily. Improved digestion of lactose was not due to hydrolysis of the lactose prior to consumption, which indicated that the beneficial effect must have occurred in the digestive tract after consumption of milk containing L. acidophilus.
TI  - D-Lactic acidosis in children: an unusual metabolic complication of small bowel resection.
AB  - Acidosis caused by intestinal bacterial D-lactate production occurs in ruminants  engorged with carbohydrate. A similar phenomenon was identified in two children who developed recurrent episodes of metabolic acidosis and peculiar neurologic symptoms in response to increased dietary carbohydrate after major small bowel resections. Both children were found to have elevated plasma concentrations of D-lactic acid at the time of each episode. Acid base and neurologic abnormalities responded immediately to neomycin therapy. Among a number of microorganisms isolated from stool cultures of these patients, one anaerobic Lactobacillus acidophilus species produced large amounts of D-lactate in vitro. Reduction in carbohydrate intake in one patient tested led to a fall in D-lactate generation. We believe that excessive D-lactate production by intestinal bacteria, from malabsorbed carbohydrate, may produce metabolic acidosis and neurologic symptoms in children with small bowel resections.

AB  
TI  - A Phylogenetic Analysis of Lactobacilli, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Leuconostoc  mesenteroides.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. helveticus, L. lactis, L. brevis, L. plantarum, L.  ruminis, L. casei, L. bifermentans, L. viridescens, L. fermentum, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Leuconostoc mesenteroides have been characterized by oligonucleotide cataloguing of their 16 S ribosomal RNAs. All Lactobacillus species investigated together with P. pentosaceus and L. mesenteroides form a phylogenetically coherent and ancient group. L. acidophilus and L. helveticus is the only closely related pair of species; all other species are only remotely related among each other, indicating that they are well-defined species. Lactobacillus, together with Streptococcus and Bacillus, constitute a super-cluster within the 'clostridium' sub-branch of Gram-positive eubacteria showing a low guanine plus cytosine content of their deoxyribonucleic acid.
TI  - Exogenous lactobacilli fed to man - their fate and ability to prevent diarrheal disease.
AB  - Clinical and microbiologic studies were conducted to evaluate the capability of exogenous lactobacilli to implant in the upper small intestine, the ability of exogenous lactobacilli to prevent enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) diarrhea, and the effect of lactobacillus therapy in reduction of diarrhea due to neomycin. Microbiologic studies of jejunal aspirates indicated that orally ingested Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. bulgaricus in LactinexR and L. acidophilus in Infloran BernaR survived passage through the stomach and remained viable in the proximal small bowel for three to six hours in most, not all, individuals. Challenge studies with ETEC revealed that despite the ability of lactobacilli in LactinexR to persist in the upper small intestine for several hours, the lactobacillus preparation did not prevent or alter the course of ETEC diarrhea in adults. Lactobacillus therapy with one lot of LactinexR reduced the volume and duration of neomycin-associated diarrhea, whereas another lot of LactinexR had no therapeutic effect. Thus, lot to lot variations in lactobacillus preparations may account for some conflicting results observed with lactobacillus therapy for intestinal disorders.
TI  - Metabolism of pyruvate and citrate in lactobacilli.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. casei, L. delbrueckii , L. lactis and L. plantarum contained a pyruvate oxidase for the oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl phosphate and acetate. The presence of an acetate kinase converted the acetyl phosphate to acetate. L. casei and L. plantarum produced lactate and acetoin, in addition to acetate, under the conditions used while L. casei also produced diacetyl. L. casei and L. plantarum were the only species to utilize citrate. L. helveticus and L. helveticus subsp. jugurti did not utilize pyruvate under the conditions used.
TI  - The effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus administration upon the survival of Salmonella in randomly selected human carriers.
AB  - The influence of Lactobacillus acidophilus in milk upon carrier time of Salmonella infected humans was compared to that in a similar population which received no acidophilus milk. The participants were 132 individuals between 3 and 73 years old of both sexes. Many were carriers of more than one infective agent. None were suffering from acute gastrointestinal symptoms nor receiving medication. The participants entered the study various times after diagnosis, and consumed acidophilus milk ad libitum continuously until 3 to 5 negative feces samples were obtained. The results were compared with a control population consisting of 160 individuals who consumed neither fermented milk products nor medication. The data show that consumption of greater than 500 ml acidophilus milk shortened the duration of the Salmonella carrier state.
TI  - Purification and properties of the inhibitory protein isolated from Lactobacillus acidophilus AC1.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus AC1 was found to produce a proteinic inhibitor having a molecular weight of 5.4 kd, active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Some of the sensitive bacteria were found to be resistant to most of the commonly employed drugs and antibiotics. Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified inhibitor showed the presence of a single polypeptide. The inhibitor was active over a wide pH range from 4.0 to 7.5. It was heat sensitive, and complete inactivation occurred within 20 min at 50 degrees C. The purified inhibitor lost 50% of its activity within 24 h at room temperature and after 5 days at 4 degrees-8 degrees C. The inhibitory protein was readily distinguished from other inhibitors in lactic cultures by its immunological cross-reactivity.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and physico-chemical properties of some alkyldimethylbenzylammonium chlorides.
AB  - A series of alkyldimethylbenzylammonium chlorides have been synthesized with n-alkyl chain lengths of C1 leads to C18. Octanol/water partition coefficients were determined and the antimicrobial activity assessed as the minimum growth inhibitory concentrations towards twelve strains of micro-organisms, representative of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, yeasts and fungi. The data were subjected to a numerical analysis. Antimicrobial activity of the compounds was found to be a parabolic function of their lipophilicity and maximized with n-alkyl chain lengths of between C12 and C16. The data fit to quadratic functions estimated for low (C1-C7) and high (C8-C16) alkyl chain length compounds was better than for a single quadratic describing the activity of the complete series (C1-C18). These maximized at log P values corresponding to alkyl-chain lengths of approximately C7 and C14 respectively, and were suggestive of low and high affinity binding sites upon the cell surface. The data analysis allowed the chain lengths of compounds with optimal activity towards the various groups of organisms to be determined. Generally yeasts and fungi were most sensitive towards C12, Gram-positive bacteria towards C14, and the Gram-negative bacteria towards C16. Gram-negative cells were the most resistant towards all the compounds and Gram-positive cells the least.
TI  - Adherence of Lactobacillus species to human fetal intestinal cells.
AB  - Thirty-two lactobacilli were tested for ability to adhere to a human fetal intestinal epithelial cell line. By an in vitro system, two adherence mechanisms were found. One mechanism, requiring calcium in the adherence reaction, was nonspecific and allowed all lactobacilli tested to adhere. The other system, not requiring calcium, was found in four strains, all human Lactobacillus acidophilus isolates. Colonial morphology, serial broth passage, and exposure of cell crops to freezing or lyophilization did not affect adherence of Lactobacillus acidophilus. In vitro adherence, combined with subsequent in vivo studies, may provide a basis for screening candidate organisms for use in microbiotic supplements.
TI  - The intestinal microflora and its colon cancer connection.
AB  - Epidemiologic studies suggest that the incidence of colon cancer is influenced by environmental factors, especially diet. The high beef-high fat-low fiber diet of Western societies is associated with a high risk of colon cancer. The intestinal microflora may play a role in colon cancer by metabolic activation of procarcinogens in the lumen of the large bowel. The link between diet and colon cancer can be explained, in part, by the alterations in fecal bacterial enzyme activity induced by a Western-style diet. For example, fecal bacterial beta-glucuronidase, nitroreductase, azoreductase and steroid 7-alpha-dehydroxylase activities are increased in animals or humans consuming a high beef diet. These enzyme activities can be reduced by eating a grain diet, by the addition of Lactobacillus acidophilus to the diet, or by administration of low dose antibiotics. In experimental animals these three measures to reduce the activity of the microflora also produce few colon tumors in animals given the chemical carcinogen dimethylhydrazine. Further studies are needed to establish whether alterations in the metabolism of the colonic microflora can reduce the risk of large bowel cancer in humans.
TI  - [Peptide hydrolases of lactobacilli of the Thermobacterium group. I. Demonstration of these activities in Lactobacillus helveticus, L. acidophilus, L. lactis and L. bulgaricus].
AB  - The intracellular peptide hydrolase activities of Lactobacillus helveticus, L. acidophilus, L. lactis, and L. bulgaricus were determined using various aminopeptidase, dipeptidase, and carboxypeptidase substrates in addition to casein and whey protein fractions. The different activities were then separated using disc gel electrophoresis. Each bacterium had aminopeptidase activity towards various amino acid beta-naphthylamides and dipeptides. The four species also showed bands of true dipeptidase activities on a large number of dipeptides. Intracellular enzymes from thermophilic lactobacilli also hydrolysed the whey proteins (alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin). From the results of electrophoresis on beta-casein and alpha s1-casein it was shown that beta-casein was totally hydrolysed by L. lactis while it was only partially hydrolysed by the intracellular enzymes of L. acidophilus and L. bulgaricus. On the other hand, alpha s1-casein was only partially hydrolysed by L. helveticus, L. lactis, and L. bulgaricus.
TI  - [Clinical experience using solco trichovac in the treatment of trichomonad infections in women].
AB  - A lactobacillus vaccine was administered to 102 women with vaginal trichomonad infections. In about half of these patients a local trichomonacidal treatment using Nitroimidazol derivatives was also carried out. After completion of the primary course of treatment 84% of the women were free of symptoms and no trichomonads could be demonstrated; within one year this figure had risen to 96%. Reinfections after completion of the primary course of treatment and after booster vaccination occurred in only 4-5% of the cases. The bacterial status of the vagina as described by Jirovec and Peter improved markedly, the degree of improvement being related to the number of vaccine treatments performed. After only one vaccination an improvement from Grace V (= trichomoniasis) to Grade I or II was seen in 64% of the patients. Six months after the primary course of treatment the vaginal status of 82% of the women was rated Grade I or II, and six months after the booster vaccination given after one year the corresponding figure was 80%. The lactobacillus vaccine treatment described represents a promising development in the therapy of trichomonad and bacterial infections in women.
TI  - Commensalistic Interaction Between Lactobacillus acidophilus and Propionibacterium shermanii.
AB  - Propionibacterium shermanii and Lactobacillus acidophilus were grown in batch mixed culture in a 5-liter fermenter under controlled conditions of pH 5.8 and 35 degrees C on a semisynthetic medium with glucose as an energy source. Cellular efficiencies and fermentation balances were developed for this pair and compared with P. shermanii grown in pure culture on glucose, lactate, and a mixture of these substrates and with L. acidophilus grown on glucose. P. shermanii had ATP yield coefficient values of 17 for each substrate alone but had an average value of 30 for substrate mixtures. Growth rates were similar for P. shermanii on glucose or lactate but higher cell yields were observed for glucose. P. shermanii used both lactate and glucose in mixed substrate until lactate was exhausted, and growth rates slowed thereafter. L. acidophilus had a similar ATP yield coefficient of 15 but produced lower cell yields than did P. shermanii on glucose. Mixed culture of both microorganisms on glucose resulted in much faster and nearly equal growth rates for both and no lactate accumulation in the medium. Acetic acid production rates per generation were lower in mixed culture, suggesting use by the growing culture. The cause of the synergistic effect was not determined but may be due to the rapid production and removal of lactate or CO(2) enhancement in mixed culture.

AB  - Lactic bacilli of 15 species were divided into 78 bacteriocin types by their sensitivity spectra with respect to the main set of the bacteriocinogenic strains. L. acidophilus-L. salivarious, L. jugurti, L. casei, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. brevis, L. buchneri, L. helveticus, L. lactis and L. leichmannii were used in the study. The cultures were divided into 30, 9, 7, 25, 5, 20, 13, 8, 2.2 and 2 bacteriocin types respectively. The method of determining the lactic bacilli sensitivity spectra to 8 bacteriocinogenic strains of the main kit is simple and economic. It allows marking of lactic bacilli and their dividing into bacteriocin types within the species. This may be used in taxonomy and epidemiological studies.
TI  - Immunisation of rhesus monkeys with Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus and lipoteichoic acid for protection against dental caries.
AB  - An attempt was made to protect rhesus monkeys from dental caries by immunisation  with Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus and lipoteichoic acid (LTA). The vaccine composed of S. mutans gave significant protection against caries, a decrease in the number of S. mutans, an increase in IgG antibodies and a moderate increase in complement-fixing antibodies to LTA. When LTA was used as immunogen, there was only a small reduction in caries, without any detectable antibodies to LTA and a slight increase in IgG antibodies to cell of S. mutans. Vaccines of L. acidophilus or L. fermentum gave no protection. A combined vaccine of S. mutans and L. acidophilus did not reduce the incidence of caries but the antibody titre to cells of S. mutans was raised to a level comparable with that in the S. mutans-immunised monkeys. The results of this investigation in a subhuman primate confirm that immunisation with S. mutans induces protection against caries, unlike the attempt to immunise with two selected strains of lactobacilli. More studies are required to establish the role of specific serotypes of lactobacilli in the development of dental caries.
TI  - Influence of dietary lactose on the gut flora of chicks.
AB  - 1. The gut microflora of chicks fed on a purified diet containing 300 g lactose plus 300 g starch/kg was compared with that of control birds receiving a diet containing 600 g starch/kg. 2. In 14-d-old conventional chicks, lactose in the diet decreased the incidence of lactobacilli and clostridia in the caecal contents, although when presenting lactose-fed chicks the counts of lactobacilli exceeded those of control chicks. 3. High counts of Proteus sp. were present in the caeca of control birds but they were completely suppressed in conventional birds fed on the lactose diet. In vitro tests showed that this inhibition was partially due to Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis. 4. The growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus was inhibited by lactose when gnotobiotic chicks were monoassociated but not when polyassociated. The protective effect was shown in vitro to be due to L. salivarius. 5. The pH was markedly lowered in the caecum of conventional and polyassociated chicks receiving dietary lactose. Of the strains used in gnotobiotic experiments E. coli, S. faecalis and L. salivarius produced the lowest pH values in the caeca.
TI  - In vivo inhibitory effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus against pathogenic Escherichia coli in gnotobiotic chicks.
AB  - Chicks were hatched germfree in gnotobiotic isolators to determine the inhibitory effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus towards pathogeneic Escherichia coli in vivo. Twelve trials were conducted in two flexible film isolators utilizing a total of 221 chicks. One treatment consisted of inoculating 2-day-old chicks with L. acidophilus, then challenging with pathogenic E. coli with subsequent dosing with L. acidophilus. The other treatment consisted of challenging with the E. coli at 2 days of age, then subsequently dosing with L. acidophilus. Statistical analysis of the data showed initial dosing with L. acidophilus prevented excessive mortality when chicks were challenged with E. coli. Also, continued dosing with L. acidophilus lowered the pH in the crop, cecum, and rectum whether chicks were initially given L. acidophilus or E. coli. This strain of L. acidophilus was capable of competing with E. coli in the gut of gnotobiotic chicks.
TI  - [Incidence and clinical importance of Haemophilus vaginalis (Corynebacterium vaginalis) (author's transl)].
AB  - In 250 women aged between 16 and 55 years who came to a gynaecologist we looked for haemophilus vaginalis. In 9.6% it was possible to culture haemophilus vaginalis. The comparison of the differential vaginalis (V-)medium of Greenwood with the starch medium of Smith showed the much better resolution of the Greenwood medium. In one-half of the patients with haemophilus vaginalis there was no clinical evidence of pathogenicity of the bacterium, whereas in the other half, there was only a slight symptomatology. Haemophilus vaginalis and lactobacillus acidophilus seem to exclude each other. The strains of haemophilus vaginalis were resistant to sulfonamides, polymyxin B and aminoglycoside antibiotics.
TI  - Toxic shock syndrome: an ecologic imbalance within the genital microflora of women?
AB  - Epidemiologic data suggested that toxic shock syndrome (TSS) may be caused by an  imbalance among the flora of the female genital tract. Since natural defense mechanisms often involve antagonistic interactions between the flora and potential pathogens, the ability of genital lactobacilli to inhibit Staphylococcus aureus was determined in agar overlay assays. Lactobacilli were chosen for study because previous investigations had suggested an important role for this genus in maintenance of health of the female genital tract. Fourteen of 50 strains of lactobacilli and Lactinex inhibited the growth of certain staphylococci, including strains from cases of TSS. The inhibitory activity of some lactobacilli was variable and could be enhanced by exogenously supplied substrates. Growth of one consistently inhibitory lactobacillus was inhibited by Staphylococcus aureus. A model for the etiology of toxic shock syndrome in menstruating women is proposed. The model includes antagonistic interactions between lactobacilli and staphylococci and the influence of tampons on these interactions to favor the staphylococcus.

AB  - 1. A semi-synthetic diet, the semi-synthetic diet plus pectin, and a stock diet were fed to rats, and three metabolic functions of the caecal bacteria (reduction of amaranth, p-nitrobenzoic acid and nitrate) were measured in vitro. 2. No consistent differences were noted between diets for the reduction of amaranth and p-nitrobenzoic acid. 3. No consistent differences in nitrate reductase activity were noted for rats maintained on a stock diet or a fibre-free diet. However, the addition of 5% pectin to the latter diet resulted in a several-fold increase in nitrite production. 4. This increased nitrite production in vitro was associated with methaemoglobinaemia following the oral administration of nitrate to rats fed the diet containing pectin. Animals receiving the basal fibre-free diet were unaffected by nitrate.

The study provided a set of 20 indicator strains of Lactobacilli. With the use of this set it is possible to mark Lactobacilli of various species and differentiate them into 39 bacteriocinogenic types. This may be used in taxonomic and epidemiological studies.
TI  - Drug resistance plasmids in Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  - Sixteen strains of Lactobacillus reuteri and 20 strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus were tested for resistance to 22 antibiotics by using commercially available sensitivity disks. Evidence suggesting linkage of these resistances to plasmids was obtained by "curing" experiments with acridine dyes and high growth temperatures. Examination of plasmid patterns of agarose gel electrophoresis provided further evidence of loss in plasmid DNA under curing conditions in some of the strains examined.
TI  - Effectiveness of milk products in dietary management of lactose malabsorption.
AB  - Eleven lactose malabsorbers were studied to compare the effectiveness of commercially available products recommended for dietary treatment of lactose malabsorption. One product, a commercial lactase preparation, is added to milk for lactose hydrolysis before consumption. The other is a commercial milk product containing lactose-hydrolyzing, nonpathogenic bacteria, Lactobacillus acidophilus. Both of these products are presently recommended for management of lactose malabsorption, although such recommendations have not been validated by controlled studies. Lactose malabsorption was determined by breath H2 analyses after subjects drank four different test doses on 4 different days. The first test dose was 480 ml of low fat milk; the second was 480 ml of milk treated with a commercial lactase preparation; the third was 480 ml of a commercial L. acidophilus-containing milk; and the fourth was 480 ml of the L. acidophilus-containing milk after 1 wk of gastrointestinal exposure to this commercial bacteria-containing milk. The mean breath H2 response to the lactase-treated milk was significantly lower (p less than 0.001) than the mean response to regular milk. However, the mean breath H2 response to either of the test doses of the L. acidophilus-containing milk were not significantly different than responses to regular milk. It is concluded that the lactase-treated milk reduces breath H2 responses and symptomatic discomfort from malabsorption while the L. acidophilus-containing milk does not.

AB  - Sensitivity of 278 cultures of Thermobacterium to 30 types of bacteriocins produced by L. acidophilus, L. salivarius, L. jugurti, L. casei, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. brevis and L. buchneri was studied with the method of delayed antagonism. It was shown that all cultures of L. Salivarius, L. jugurti, L. helveticus, L. lactis, L. leichmannii, L. bulgaricus and L. delbrueckii and 94.1 per cent of L. acidophilus were sensitive to one or several bacteriocin types. The cultures of L. acidophilus, L. salivarius and L. jugurti, L. helveticus, L. lactis, L. bulgaricus and L. delbrueckii were sensitive to 26, 15, 28, 2 and 29 lactocin types respectively.

AB  - Genetic lesions responsible for amino acid requirements in several species of multiple auxotrophic lactobacilli were investigated. Systematic attempts were made to isolate mutants that could grow in the absence of each of the amino acids required by the parental strains of Lactobacillus plantarum, L. casei, L. helveticus, and L. acidophilus. After treatment with appropriate mutagens, such mutants could be obtained with respect to many but not all required amino acids. Successful isolation of mutants for a given amino acid means that a minor genetic lesion reparable by single-step mutations affects its biosynthesis; a failure to isolate mutants suggests the involvement of more extensive lesions. Analysis of these results as well as the specific requirements exhibited by the parental strains revealed certain regularities; some of the biosynthetic pathways for individual amino acids were virtually unaffected by more extensive lesions in at least species tested, whereas others were affected by more extensive lesions in at least some species. Both the number and the kind of pathways affected by extensive lesions differed appreciably among different species. Furthermore, the growth response of the parental strains to some putative amino acid precursors revealed a clear correlation between the extent of genetic lesions and the occurrence and location of a genetic block(s) for a given pathway. These findings are discussed in relation to the phylogeny, ecology, and evolution of lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Interval sampling of breath hydrogen (H2) as an index of lactose malabsorption in lactase-deficient subjects.
AB  - Interval sampling of breath hydrogen content was used in lactose malabsorbers: (1) to compare hydrogen responses following increasing oral doses of lactose in milk and aqueous solutions; (2) to determine the reproducibility of interval breath sampling, and (3) to compare carbohydrate malabsorption following ingestion of either regular milk or milk containing Lactobacillus acidophilus. Significant differences in breath hydrogen responses due to increasing amounts of lactose in milk and aqueous solutions were observed. The individual breath hydrogen responses were reproducible using the same lactose dose on different days. There was no significant difference in breath hydrogen responses or symptoms following administration of either regular milk or milk containing Lactobacillus acidophilus. Breath hydrogen sampling at intervals, as performed in these studies, provides a sensitive and reproducible index of lactose malabsorption.
TI  - Introduction and reisolation of selected gram-negative bacteria from fermented edible wastes.
AB  - A Lactobacillus fermentation process, using edible food wastes, was tested for its ability to eliminate selected bacterial pathogens. This fermentation process converts food wastes into a feed ingredient for animal consumption. Six gram-negative bacterial pathogens of potential zoonotic importance were tested. These experimental organisms were: Salmonella enteritidis serovar typhimurium, S enteritidis serovar anatum, S cholerae-suis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Y pseudotuberculosis, and Pasteurella multocida. Each organism was introduced into ground waste that had been previously inoculated with L acidophilus, and was mixed. This mixture was divided among 8 containers, and was incubated in duplicate at 5 C, 10 C, 20 C, and 30 C for 96 hours. The temperature of the reactant containers, reduction-oxidation potential, and pH were monitored. Waste samples were obtained initially and subsequently at 24-hour periods for 96 hours. Qualitative and quantitative recovery attempts from each sample were made for the introduced gram-negative bacteria. Pasteurella multocida and the S enteritidis serovars typhimurium and anatum survived the fermentation at 5 C and 10 C, but were killed after 48 hours at 20 C and 30 C. Salmonella cholerae-suis survived at 5 C, but was destroyed by 72 hours at the remaining temperatures. Yersinia enterocolitica was viable through 70 hours, but was killed by 96 hours. Yersinia pseudotuberculosis was not reisolated at any temperature.
TI  - Introduction and reisolation of selected gram-positive bacteria from fermented edible wastes.
AB  - A fermentation process using Lactobacillus acidophilus added to edible food wastes was evaluated for its bactericidal action on selected gram-positive organisms. The Lactobacillus fermentation converts food wastes into an animal feed ingredient. In this study, 5 gram-positive bacteria of zoonotic importance were individually tested. These organisms were: Group E Streptococcus, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, Clostridium perfringens, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, and Listeria monocytogenes. For each experiment, Lactobacillus was first mixed into ground waste; one of the test organisms was then inoculated and mixed. This mixture was divided among eight 5.5-L containers and incubated (duplicates) at 5 C, 10 C, 20 C, and 30 C for 96 hours. Internal waste temperature, reduction-oxidation, and pH were monitored. Waste samples were taken initially and at subsequent 24-hour periods. Qualitative and quantitative recoveries of the test bacteria were attempted for each sample. Group E Streptococcus was reisolated in increasing numbers at all temperatures throughout the fermentation period. Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae was recovered throughout the 96-hour period at 5 C; at 10 C it was recovered at 24 hours but not at 48 hours. Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae was killed by 24 hours at 20 C and 30 C fermentation temperatures. Clostridium perfringens survived the entire test period at 5 C, 10 C, and 20 C; it was killed by 72 hours at 30 C. Neither Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis nor Listeria monocytogenes was reisolated at any temperature at any time.
TI  - Lactobacillus prophylaxis for diarrhea due to enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli.
AB  - In vitro and animal experiments indicated that lactobacilli might prevent Escherichia coli from colonizing the intestine and may produce substances counteracting enterotoxin. Lactinex, a commercial preparation of dried Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. bulgaricus, is marketed for uncomplicated diarrhea. Preliminary experiments in nonfasting volunteers indicated that lactobacilli in this preparation colonized the small intestine for up to 6 h. To evaluate the protective efficacy of Lactinex, a double-blind randomized study was carried out in which 48 volunteers (23 receiving Lactinex and 25 receiving placebos) were challenged with E. coli strains that produced heat-stable or heat-labile enterotoxins or both. No significant differences between the two groups were noted with respect to attack rate, incubation period, duration of diarrhea, volume and number of liquid stools, and coproculture yields. These data suggest that this lactobacillus preparations does not prevent or alter the course of enterotoxigenic E. coli diarrhea in adults. Lack of efficacy occurred despite efforts to maximize small bowel colonization, including administration of Lactinex in milk and in a 6-hour-interval regimen during 36 h before and 96 h after challenge.
TI  - Growth Characteristics, Bile Sensitivity, and Freeze Damage in Colonial Variants  of Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Rough (R) and smooth (S) colonial variants were isolated from a heterogeneous culture of Lactobacillus acidophilus RL8K. R and S types were stable upon repeated transfer on agar, but revertant colonies did appear after broth transfers. When propagated in commercial MRS broth, R and S cultures showed similar growth characteristics, and both cell types were insensitive to freezing and frozen storage at -20 degrees C. Alternatively, during growth in scratch MRS broth, R cultures shifted to a reduced rate of growth during the late logarithmic phase. R cells grown under these conditions were susceptible to death by freezing and injury at -20 degrees C. Microscopically, R cells were observed as long gram-positive rods with small nonstainable blebs protruding from the cell wall. In bile sensitivity studies of R and S cells plated on MRS agar plus oxgall, the S culture was resistant to 1% bile, whereas the R culture was sensitive to 0.6% bile. Differences in the bile resistance and freeze damage of R and S cells suggest that colonial and cellular morphologies are important considerations for the selection of Lactobacillus strains as dietary adjuncts and for the development of growth conditions for preparing frozen concentrated cultures from either cell type.
TI  - Characterization of the cecal bacteria of normal pigs.
AB  - One hundred ninety-two isolates from cecal contents of three normal weaned pigs were obtained by means of anaerobic roll tube methods and were characterized. Seventy-eight percent of the isolates were gram-negative. The most numerous species isolated from each of the pigs was Bacteroides ruminicola. This species accounted for 35% of the isolates that were characterized, and Selenomonas ruminantium accounted for 21% of the isolates. Other gram-negative bacteria isolated from all three pigs were Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens (6.0%) and Bacteroides uniformis (3.0%); predominant gram-positive isolates were Lactobacillus acidophilus (7.6%), Peptostreptococcus productus (3.0%), and Eubacterium aerofaciens (2.5%). The other 42 isolates were placed in 14 other species, and 5 additional isolates that did not fit well into existing species were not placed taxonomically. Fifteen of the isolates (representing nine species) produced urease.
TI  - The fate of ingested lactobacilli in the proximal small intestine.
AB  - A freeze-dried commercial preparation of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus (Lactinex) dissolved in skim milk was ingested by four nonfasting and seven fasting informed community volunteers in the Isolation Ward of the Center for Vaccine Development. Samples of jejunal fluid withdrawn from the volunteers at varying intervals were cultured for lactobacilli on a selective medium. Quantitative counts varied considerably amongst the individuals studied and also in the same person examined on two consecutive occasions. In general, however, it was shown that lactobacilli entered the small intestine and persisted in elevated numbers for about 3 h in fasting subjects and for up to 6 h in nonfasting individuals. By 4 h, counts in fasting volunteers had returned to base-line levels. Although both Lactobacillus species in Lactinex entered the intestine in approximately equal numbers, L. acidophilus was recovered from more samples and in slightly greater number than L. bulgaricus.
TI  - Calcium-Induced Alteration of Cellular Morphology Affecting the Resistance of Lactobacillus acidophilus to Freezing.
AB  - Examination of factors affecting the resistance of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM culture concentrates to freeze injury induced during frozen storage at -20 degrees C revealed that calcium supplementation of the growth medium contributed to the storage stability of cells prepared in static culture. Culture concentrates of L. acidophilus NCFM were prepared from cells propagated in MRS broth or MRS broth supplemented with 0.1% calcium carbonate, calcium chloride, or calcium phosphate. After 28 days of frozen storage at -20 degrees C, concentrated cells (3.2 x 10 colony-forming units per ml) prepared from MRS broth cultures showed an 84% reduction in viable cells. Of the remaining viable cells, 88% were sublethally injured and unable to form colonies on MRS agar supplemented with 0.15% bile. Cells prepared in calcium-supplemented MRS broths demonstrated more resistance to frozen storage. Viability and injury losses in the frozen concentrates were limited to 10 to 39% and 3 to 23%, respectively. It was observed that calcium supplementation of MRS medium resulted in a morphological transition of L. acidophilus NCFM from filamentous to bacilloid rods, and the bacilloid cells were more resistant to freezing and storage at conventional freezer temperatures. The results suggest that the morphology of the L. acidophilus cell may be an important consideration in the preparation of freeze-stable culture concentrates.
TI  - Properties of alpha-glucosidase from Lactobacillus acidophilus NCTC 1723.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus NCTC 1723 produced intracellular and extracellular alpha-glucosidase (alpha-D-glucoside glucohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.20). The alpha-glucosidase was partially purified by ammonium sulphate fractionation and DEAE-cellulose column chromatography, and attained a 10.3-fold purification. The Km for alpha-PNPG was 2.9 mM and the Vmax for alpha-PNPG hydrolysis was 6.45 mumole ml-1 min-1. The enzyme was stable only at pH 6.0-7.5 while incubated at 25 degrees C. At pH 6.5, a 100% activity was retained at 15 degrees-37 degrees C. However, the enzyme was easily destroyed at 50 degrees C. The pH optimum for stability of the enzyme at low temperature (2 degrees C) was between 5 and 6. It was found that addition of Mn++, Ba++ and EDTA, to the medium stimulated alpha-glucosidase activity, while the presence of Hg++, Cu++, Co++, Ni++, Zn++, L-histidine, arabitol, erythritol, sorbitol and glycerol inhibited enzyme activity. Although isomaltase activity was found in the partially purified alpha-glucosidase, it was not known whether this activity was an intrinsic capability of the enzyme. Transglucosylase and weak glucoamylase activities were also found to associate with the partially purified alpha-glucosidase. Since only the alpha-1,6 linked isomaltose was detected as the transferase product, it was thought that the alpha-glucosidase was capable of glucosyl transfer via alpha-1,6-glucosidic bonds.
TI  - Effect of lactobacilli on urinary indican excretion in gnotobiotic rats and in man.
AB  - The effect of Lactobacillus species on urinary indican excretion in two types of  gnotobiotic rats (GBH-9 and GB-5) and in man was studied. L. salivarius, L. plantarum and L. casei colonized in the cecum and colon of both types of rats at levels of 10(7) to 10(8) per gram of contents following one-dose oral administration and caused a significant reduction in urinary indican excretion, whereas two strains of L. acidophilus which colonized at low levels (10(4) to 10(5)/g) did not reduce indican excretion. Daily feeding of Lactobacillus concentrates caused a further significant reduction in indican excretion which was corrected by tryptophan intake, even in the case of L. acidophilus. There was a clear relationship between fecal lactobacillus counts and urinary indican. A significant reduction of indican secretion was obtained only when the fecal counts of lactobacilli exceeded 10(7).4/g in rats. L. casei also had an effect in man, reducing urinary excretion of indican and p-cresol. Reduction in indican excretion seems to be accompanied by decreasing fecal tryptophanase activity in rats and man. A negative correlation was also obtained between fecal resident lactobacilli and urinary indican in man (r = -0.532, n = 28, p less than 0.01). Subjects with lactobacilli at a level of 10(6)/g or more excreted less indican than those harboring the bacteria at levels below 10(5)/g.
TI  - Survival of viruses in fermented edible waste material.
AB  - The survival of selected viruses in fermented edible waste material was studied to determine the feasibility of using this material as a livestock feed ingredient. Seven viruses, including pseudorabies, Newcastle disease, infectious canine hepatitis, avian infectious bronchitis, measles, vesicular stomatitis, and a porcine picornavirus were inoculated into a mixture of ground food waste (collected from a school lung program) containing Lactobacillus acidophilus. Mixtures were incubated at 5 C, 10 C, 20 C, and 30 C for 96 hours. Temperature, pH, and redox potential were monitored. Samples for virus isolation were obtained daily. Newcastle disease virus and infectious canine hepatitis virus survived the entire test period. The porcine picornavirus was inactivated at 30 C after 74 hours, but survived for the entire test period at the other temperatures. Pseudorabies virus was inactivated at 20 C and 30 C within 24 hours, but survived for 48 hours at 10 C and 96 hours at 5 C. Avian infectious bronchitis virus was inactivated at 20 C and 30 C within 24 hours, but survived 72 hours at 5 C and 10 C. Measles and vesicular stomatitis viruses were rapidly inactivated at all 4 temperatures.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of some intestinal bacteria on liver tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic C3H/He male mice.
AB  - Liver tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic C3H/He male mice was markedly promoted by association with a bacterial combination of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, and Clostridium paraputrificum. This study demonstrated that this promoting effect was suppressed by addition of certain intestinal bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Eubacterium rectale.
TI  - [Effectiveness of a lactobacillus vaccine on trichomonas infections in women. Preliminary results].
AB  - This is the report on a multi-centre study of the treatment of 444 women with trichomoniasis vaginalis using Solcotrichovac, a vaccine containing at least 7 x 10(9) inactivated microorganisms of various strains of lactobacillus acidophilus in each 0.5 ml dose. One year after the first vaccination 427 of the patients (96.2%) were followed up, and 92.5% of them were found to be cured of clinical symptoms; the remaining 7.5% must be considered as not cured, as either the slide or the culture was positive. We are convinced by these results that vaccination with Solcotrichovac represents an enhancement of therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of trichomoniasis vaginalis.
TI  - [Mycoplasmas and dysplasia of the uterine cervix].
AB  - The Authors report a case-list of 395 patients vaginal specimens who were never treated with chemo-antibiotic therapy. Cell dysplastic impairments were found in 213 cases. About these dysplastic alterations, 133 are of slight type, 53 intermediate type and 27 are in advanced phase. We can say, about the last 27 cases, that the concomitance of pH greater than 6.1 in 67% of the cases and the absence of Lactobacillus acidophilus in 81.4% of the cases is not casual. Furthermore, we can notice that vaginal pH suffers an increase in dysplastic patients with a smaller colonization with Lactobacillus acidophilus that, in dysplastic advanced phase is absent in 81.4% of the cases. It is also to remark a significant increase of cases Trichomonas-positive and Mycoplasmas-positive in dysplastic patients, as compared with normal women. The results of the case-list, even if preliminary, seem to be indicative for an evolution of the studies on the relationship between uterine cervix cells and Mycoplasmas and eventual possibility the Mycoplasmas can act as carriers of oncogenic viruses such as Herpes and Papova Virus.

TI  - Factors affecting the quaternary structure of the allosteric L-lactate dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus curvatus as investigated by hybridization and ultracentrifugation.
AB  - The allosteric L-lactate dehydrogenases of Lactobacillus curvatus and Lactobacillus casei exist in the tetrameric from (molecular weight about 145 000) at pH 5.0--5.5 even in the absence of the effectors Mn2+ and Fru(1,6)P2 (fructose 1,6-bisphosphate), but undergo reversible dissociation to monomers (molecular weight about 35 000) at higher pH values or in the presence of urea. In the range between pH 5.5 (tetrameric state) and pH 7.4 (monomeric state) the L. curvatus L-lactate dehydrogenase exists in a dissociation-association equilibrium comprising tetramers, dimers and monomers as indicated by the Sc20,w values and the results of hybridization experiments. The simultaneous addition of both effectors [Mn2+ and Fru(1,6)P2] at pH 7.4, however, resulted in the stabilization of the tetrameric form. The addition of Fru(1,6)P2 alone at pH 7.4 had almost no influence on the quarternary structure, whereas the addition of Mn2+, as well as that of NADH, largely prevented dissociation. The L-lactate dehydrogenase of L. casei showed similar properties, although the enzyme dissociates only at about pH greater than or equal to 7.8. As in the case of the L. curvatus enzyme, Fru(1,6)P2 has no influence on the pH-dependent dissociation of the L. casei enzyme, whereas Mn2+ stabilizes the tetrameric structure. Reconstitution of a mixture of the two dissociated enzymes results in the formation of all statistically possible, enzymatically active hybrids. No hybridization between the allosteric enzymes from L. casei and L. curvatus and the non-allosteric ones of Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus acidophilus was observed.

Vaginal implantation of nonfermented acidophilus milk, yogurt, or low-fat milk for preventing recurrence of monilia vaginitis subsequent to treatment with Nystatin was studied with 30 women. Reinfections within 3 mo according to product received were: no milk product, 3; yogurt, 1; nonfermented acidophilus milk, 1; and low-fat milk, 0.
TI  - [Dental caries].
AB  - Recent studies on the etiology and prevention of dental caries are synthetized. Caries is an infectious disease produced by the bacterial plaque where microorganisms act upon hydrocarbon substrate producing acids (lactic, pyruvic, acetic, etc.). These acids decalcify the enamel surface producing the carious cavity. The three types of caries are mentioned: 1. The sucrose-dependent caries on the free surfaces of the tooth with the Streptococcus mutans predominance. 2. The pits and fissures caries with Lactobacillus acidophilus predominance. 3. The root caries with Acinomyces viscosus predominance. Caries prevention points out to three aspects. 1. Increasing tooth resistance through the use of ingested fluoride and/or topical fluorides and pits and fissure sealants. 2. A profuse and promising research work on control of microbial plaque is being done. Meanwhile, the correct and periodically controlled toothbrushing is still the most efficient preventive measure. 3. Diet control. Being carbohydrates a deep rooted habit of our modern culture, its control has to be carefully evaluated. A judicious and reduced strategic consumption of carbohydrates and the use of substitutes are useful ways of achieving the preventive aims.
TI  - Detection of plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid in an isolate of Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Eight strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus were examined for the presence of plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid, and one, a pig intestinal isolate, showed the presence of a 13.7- and a 6.3-megadalton plasmid. This is the first reported evidence for plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid in Lactobacillus acidophilus. The functions of these plasmids are presently unknown.

TI  - Influence of feeding fermented colostrum and Lactobacillus acidophilus on fecal flora of dairy calves.
AB  - Twenty Holstein calves were assigned alternately at birth to diets of 1) fermented colostrum, 2) colostrum treated with 1% propionic acid, 3) whole milk, or 4) whole milk treated with Lactobacillus acidophilus (frozen concentrate culture) at 5 x 10(8) organisms per litter. Diets were fed once daily for 3 wk at 10% of birth weight as the sole source of nutritients. Fecal samples were collected at 0, 7, 14, and 21 days of age and analyzed for coliform and lactobacilli numbers. Fermented colostrum diets did not alter coliform counts in feces of healthy calves. Fecal coliform counts of calves fed L. acidophilus decreased with time. Average fecal lactobacilli counts were lower for the colostrum diets than milk diets. The apparent lowered incidence of scours frequently reported in calves fed fermented colostrum diets was not reflected in major changes in fecal microflora under the conditions of this study.
TI  - Production of Hydrogen peroxide by Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Hydrogen peroxide production in reconstituted skim milk (10%) and low-fat milk by four strains lf Lactobacillus acidophilus was studied at 37 and 4 C. Strains A and B produced little, but strains C and D produced larger amounts, especially if agitated continuously during growth at 37 C or storage at 4 C. Continuous shaking was required at 4 C for C or D (4.0 X 10(8)/ml) to produce sufficient hydrogen peroxide to retard growth of Pseudomonas fragi. Flavin adenine dinucleotide stimulated the oxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide by dialyzed cell-free extracts of C and D, which indicated that the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidases of these strains produce hydrogen peroxide as an end product.
TI  - Antimicrobial action of dental cements.
AB  - It was observed that some of the cements tested had bacteriostatic and/or bactericidal action. The cements listed in decreasing order of effectiveness are (1) zinc oxide-eugenol, (2) silicophosphate, (3) zinc phosphate, and (4) silicate. The two newer cements, polycarboxylate and composite resin, exhibited no measurable antimicrobial action.
TI  - Effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus dietary supplements on 1,2-dimethylhydrazine  dihydrochloride-induced intestinal cancer in rats.
AB  - The epidemiologic patterns of large bowel cancer have implicated a diet high in beef as a risk factor. Another study has shown less colon cancer in Finns than in Danes. Among the possible explanations were the consumption of milk and fermented dairy products and the numbers of lactobacilli in the fecal flora, both of which were higher in the Finns. As a test of these hypotheses, 20 mg 1,2-dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride/kg body weight was administered for 20 weeks to male inbred F344 rats. Rats consuming a beef diet simulating a "Western" diet had higher rates of colon cancer than did grain-fed rats (83% vs. 31%, respectively). Viable cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus were fed to rats eating the meat diet; the rats were then challenged with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride. The colon cancer incidence after a 20-week induction period was lower in the animals receiving the L. acidophilus (40% vs. 77% in controls), but no difference in incidence was discerned after a 36-week period. Thus dietary supplements of L. acidophilus seemed to increase the latency or induction time for experimental colon cancer.
TI  - Effect of diet and Lactobacillus acidophilus supplements on human fecal bacterial enzymes.
AB  - The effect of diet and Lactobacillus acidophilus supplements on fecal microflora  enzyme activity was studied in humans. The bacterial enzymes that were investigated are known to catalyze reactions that may result in formation of proximal carcinogens. Compared to vegetarians, omnivores eating a "Western-type" diet had higher levels of beta-glucuronidase, nitroreductase, azoreductase, and steroid 7-alpha-dehydroxylase in their fecal microflora. Removal of red meat or addition of fiber in the form of bran or wheat germ to the diet of omnivores for 30 days had no effect on beta-glucuronidase, nitroreductase, or azoreductase activity. However, removal of red meat or addition of fiber reduced fecal steroid 7-alpha-dehydroxylase activity. The addition of viable Lactobacillus acidophilus supplements to the diet of omnivores significantly decreased fecal bacterial beta-glucuronidase and nitroreductase activities. Thirty days after Lactobacillus supplements were curtailed, fecal enzyme levels returned to normal base-line activities. These findings suggested that the metabolic activity of the fecal microflora was influenced by diet and could be altered by Lactobacillus supplements and to a lesser extent by dietary fiber.
TI  - Genetic heterogeneity among Lactobacillus acidophilus strains.
AB  - Physiological characteristics, DNA base composition (% GC) and DNA-DNA reassociation values were determined for 138 Lactobacillus acidophilus strains. Twenty seven strains were received from various culture collections and 111 strains were freshly isolated during a study on the composition of the intestinal lactic microflora of piglets and suckling calves. All strains had physiological characteristics which were substantially similar. The strains isolated from pigs were unable to ferment trehalose. The % GC ranged from 35.8 to 43.4. On the basis of the results of DNA-DNA hybridization the strains were divided into four genetic groups.
TI  - In vitro studies on distribution of indigenous lactobacilli of the gastrointestinal tract of rats.
AB  - To learn the biochemical mechanisms controlling the distribution of indigenous lactobacilli in the gastrointestinal tracts of rats, the effect of pH and stomach and cecal contents on lactobacillus distribution was investigated in vitro with a mixed culture of three lactobacillus strains isolated from the rat intestine. The pH of the growth medium affected the growth of lactobacilli strongly, irrespective of the lumenal contents. Lactobacillus fermentum outnumbered L. acidophilus and L. murini at low pH (PH 4.5; average pH of stomach contents of conventional rats) but at near neutral pH (pH 6.5; average pH of cecal contents of conventional rats), the growth of L. murini was predominant with all strains. More lactic acid was formed by lactobacilli in medium consisting of stomach contents than in cecal contents medium. L. murini grew in the nondialyzable fraction of the stomach contents and L. fermentum grew in the dialyzable fraction, but L. acidophilus did not grow in either fraction. L. murini grew in the nondialyzable fraction treated with hyaluronidase. In contrast, the nondialyzable fraction treated with pronase or chondroitinase did not allow L. murini to grow at all.
TI  - Effect of intestinal bacteria on incidence of liver tumors in gnotobiotic C3H/He  male mice.
AB  - The effect of intestinal microflora on liver tumorigenesis was studied in gnotobiotic C3H/He male mice monoassociated, diassociated, or polyassociated with the following strains of intestinal bacteria: Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium infantis, Clostridium indolis, C. paraputrificum, C. perfringens, C. innocuum, C. nexile, C. ramosum, C. clostridiiforme, Bacteroides multiacidus, Bacteroides fragilis, Veillonella alcalescens, V. parvula, and Lactobacillus acidophilus. The incidence of liver tumors was higher in most of the gnotobiotes (67--100%) and conventionalized mice (82%) derived from the germfree mice than in the germfree mice (39%). The average incidence of tumor nodules in gnotobiotes associated with E. coli, S. faecalis, and C. paraputrificum was 2.9, which was significantly higher than that in the conventionalized animals (1.6). In contrast, the average incidence of tumor nodules in gnotobiotes associated with E. coli, S. faecalis, L. acidophilus, C. perfringens, and Bacteroides fragilis (0.9) was not significantly different from that in germfree animals (0.5). The present study demonstrated that the presence of certain intestinal bacteria is related to liver tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic C3H/He male mice.
TI  - [Bacteriological examination of amniotic fluid after intra-amnial tocometry sub partu (author's transl)].
AB  - Two sets of group of 50 women were examined and compared to find out if the introduction of continuous intra-uterine catheter during labour increased infection. Amniotic fluid was withdrawn from both groups and examined. Also a catheter was introduced into the amniotic sac of one group and after 2 and 5 hours amniotic fluid was also withdrawn from both groups and examined. Inhaled amniotic fluid from the infant was also withdrawn and bacteriologically examined both quantitatively and qualitatively. The examination proved that there was no significant increase in the infection of the test group and the control group. Also there were no complications observed on the mother and child after delivery.

TI  - Nutritional and healthful aspects of cultured and culture-containing dairy foods.
AB  - Nutritional and therapeutic qualities of fermented dairy products are reviewed. Partial hydrolysis of milk constituents (proteins, fats, and lactose) in yogurt, cheese, and other cultured dary foods appears to contribute to their increased digestibility. Lactase and other constituent enzymes of various culturing organisms should contribute to assimilation of lactose by lactose intolerant individuals. Several lactic cultures synthesize certain B-vitamins in fermented dairy products. In contrast, directly acidified dairy products do not exhibit such enhancement in B-vitamins. The hypocholestremic effect of milk is enhanced by fermentation or inclusion of lactic cultures. Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and other lactic organisms produce antimicrobial agents and natural antibiotics. However, production of natural antibacterial substances by different strains of the same species vary widely. These metabolites in cultured dairy products may be responsible for increased shelf life of the foods by inhibiting a wide spectrum of food spoilage organisms. Also, consumption of cultured products containing such natural antibacterial substances may provide the consumer with protection against disease organisms. Unfermented milk containing a specific culture or strain may be consumed to invest organisms for projected beneficial effects.

Only a decrease in their growth rate and a change in their sensitivity to the action of ultraviolet radiation were observed. Both initial and antibiotic-resistant strains were capable of taking on the mucous membrane of the large and small intestines in CBA mice.
TI  - Drug therapy reviews: pharmacotherapy of diarrhea.
AB  - Gastrointestinal physiology, and the pathophysiology, diagnosis, symptoms and treatment of acute and chronic diarrhea are reviewed. Drugs used in the treatment of diarrhea include opiates (morphine, codeine), synthetic anti-diarrheals (diphenoxylate, loperamide), anticholinergics (atropine, propantheline), adsorbents (kaolin, pectin, cholestyramine resin) and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Chronic diarrhea and acute diarrhea caused by microorgansims, drugs and viruses are described. The management of diarrhea can be divided into three categories: (1) supportive therapy (fluid and electrolyte replacement); (2) symptomatic therapy which improves the consistency of the stool and reduces the frequency of bowel movements; and (3) specific therapy aimed at treating the cause (e.g., antibiotics for bacteria-induced diarrhea) or blocking the cellular mechanisms of fluid and electrolyte loss. Most acute diarrheal conditions can be managed successfully by avoiding oral solids and ingesting carbohydrate-electrolyte solutions. Synthetic antidiarrheals may increase the toxicity associated with bacterial diahhrea.
TI  - Prophylaxis against ampicillin-associated diarrhea with a lactobacillus preparation.
AB  - The efficacy of a lactobacillus preparation (Lactinex) in preventing ampicillin-associated diarrhea in adult inpatients was studied. In a double-blind procedure, 98 patients were assigned randomly to receive one packet of Lactinex (Lactobacillus acidophilus and L bulgaricus) or placebo four times daily for the first five days of ampicillin therapy. Cases of diarrhea were reviewed independently and classified according to etiology. Complete data were obtained for 79 patients--43 received placebo and 36 received Lactinex. Diarrhea occurred in nine (21%) patients receiving placebo and in three (8.3%) patients receiving Lactinex; the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.21, Fisher's Exact Test). When the patients with diarrhea unrelated to ampicillin were excluded (50%), the incidence of ampicillin-induced diarrhea in the placebo group (14%) was significantly greater (p = 0.03, Fisher's Exact Test) than in the Lactinex group (0%). Prophylactic administration of lactobacillus preparations may be effective in preventing ampicillin-induced diarrhea; however, prophylactic administration appears to be justified, on a cost/benefit basis, only in patients with a history of antibiotic-induced diarrhea.
TI  - Translocation of certain indigenous bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the mesenteric lymph nodes and other organs in a gnotobiotic mouse model.
AB  - Viable bacteria were not cultured from the mesenteric lymph nodes, spleens, or livers of specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice. Viable enteric bacteria, primarily indigenous Escherichia coli and lactobacilli, were present in the mesenteric lymph nodes of gnotobiotic mice inoculated intragastrically with the whole cecal microflora from SPF mice but not in the nodes of control SPF mice similarly inoculated. These indigenous E. coli also were cultured from the mesenteric lymph nodes of 96% of gnotobiotic mice monoassociated with E. coli but from none of the mesenteric lymph nodes of SPF mice inoculated with the E. coli. Furthermore, viable E. coli were detected in the mesenteric lymph nodes of these monoassociated gnotobiotes for as long as 112 days after inoculation. Indigenous Lactobacillus acidophilus also translocated to the mesenteric lymph nodes of gnotobiotic mice monoassociated with L. acidophilus. Apparently, there are mechanisms active in SPF mice inhibiting translocation of indigenous bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the mesenteric lymph nodes, spleens, and livers, whereas these mechanisms are either absent or reduced in gnotobiotic mice. Indigenous E. coli maintained higher population levels in the gastrointestinal tracts of the gnotobiotes compared with their population levels in SPF mice, suggesting that high bacterial population levels might promote translocation of certain bacteria from the gastrointestinal lumen to the mesenteric lymph nodes. Gnotobiotic and SPF mice, therefore, provide experimental models for determining the nature of the mechanisms operating to confine indigenous bacteria to the gastrointestinal tract in normal, healthy animals.

AB  - The bacterial composition of three so called pure culture sourdough starters of varying origin was investigated. 245 isolates were obtained all belonging to the genus Beijerinck. According to their morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics they were classified into the subgroups: Thermobacterium (L. acidophilus), Streptobacterium (L. casei, L. plantarum, L. farciminis, L. alimentarius) and Betabacterium (L. brevis, L. brevis var. lindneri, L buchneri, L. fermentum, L. fructi vorans). In the three sourdough starters the identified lactic organisms varied in number and proportion. In starter preparation "A" only the varieties L. fructi vorans and L. fermentum were present. Preparation "B" contained a great variety of microorganisms with L. brevis and L. brevis L. lindneri predominating. In starter "C" L. brevis, L. plantarum and L. alimentarius predominated.

TI  - Synergistic lysis of erythrocytes by Propionibacterium acnes.
AB  - Sheep and human erythrocytes, partially processed by Staphylococcus aureus or Clostridium perfringens, were susceptible to lysis in the presence of Propionibacterium acnes. P. acnes liberated a lipase that was detected on Tween 80 agar and also on phospholipase C-precipitated egg yolk agar. Such a lipase might have contributed in the process of an intensified cellular lysis. Similar reactions were attempted with Lactobacillus acidophilus, known to possess a nondiffusible lipase, and failed to produce any such reactions. The synergistic reactions, between P. acnes and C. perfringens, were compared with The classical CAMP reaction in an attempt to find a correlation with the established membrane composition of the erythrocytes involved. Synergistic reactions observed do seem to reflect the membrane composition. Such findings, besides being contributory to an understanding of the role of these organisms in the process of pathogenesis, are of importance in the elucidation of molecular organization of biomembranes. Detailed studies, involving a large number of representative anaerobic bacteria, may also help provide an avenue in anaerobic species identification.
TI  - Effect of a lactobacilli preparation on traveler's diarrhea. A randomized, double blind clinical trial.
AB  - The effectiveness of prophylactic ingestion of a commercial preparation of lactobacilli (Lactinex) for the prevention or modification of traveler's diarrhea was tested in a randomized double blind clinical trial in 50 volunteer travelers to Mexico from the United States. Twenty-six subjects received the lactobacilli preparation and 24 received placebo. The incidence of diarrhea and its duration during the 4 weeks of observation were quite similar for the two preparations: 35% for lactobacilli-treated subjects and 29% for placebo subjects. Typically, the diarrhea was mild, lasting 2 days. From the observations during this study we conclude that prophylactic ingestion of lactobacilli for 1 week does not reduce the incidence or duration of traveler's diarrhea either during the period of ingestion or during the following 3 weeks.
TI  - Comparison of tRNA nucleotidyltransferase from Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Purification of tRNa nucleotidyltransferase from Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4963 and Escherichia coli MRE 600 by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is described. Both enzymes gave a single band on analytical polyacrylamide-gel electroesis and sodium dodecylsulfate gels. Chromatography of the high speed supernatant from Lactobacillus at low salt concentrations gave three enzyme fractions of molecular weights about 45 000, 90 000, and 120 000. At 1M NaCl only the first enzyme fraction was found. Kinetic data for both enzymes are given.
TI  - Bacteria associated with the gastric epithelium of neonatal pigs.
AB  - Light and electron microscopy showed lactobacilli and, to a lesser degree, streptococci to be closely associated with the squamous area of the pig stomach known as the pars esophagea. Several different types of extracellular layers were seen on bacteria attached to the epithelial surface. The total number of bacteria per square centimeter did not change with age up to 10 days, and there was no effect of weaning at 2 days. Lactobacillus fermentum, L. salivarius, and Streptococcus salivarius were isolated more frequently from sucking pigs than from those that were early weaned, whereas the reverse was true of L. acidophilus and S. bovis. All isolates recovered from washed macerated pars esophagea adhered to pig esophageal epithelial cells when tested in vitro.

AB  - The formation of germtubes by twelve clinical isolates of C. albicans was studied in human serum containing per millilitre 10(3) to 10(9) organisms as: Staphylococcus pyegene, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Proteus vulgaris. All the five bacteria inhibited formation of germtubes by C. albicans at all concentrations and the percent germtube formed diminished with increasing concentration of the bacteria. Lactobacillus acidophilus inhibited the formation of germtubes maximally followed by Staphylococcus pyogene, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Proteus vulgaris in the concentrations of 10(3) to 10(7) bacteria per millilitre produced only insignificant inhibition of formation of germtubes by C. albicans. Since germtubes of C. albicans are invasive, it is suggested that inhibition of "blastospore-germtube transformation" may be significantly responsible for prevention of infection by C. albicans by coexisting bacterial flora.
TI  - Specific antigens of Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Antigens specific for Lactobacillus acidophilus were investigated by double immunodiffusion in agar-gel. Antigenic materials were extracted from whole bacteria and some walls with cold trichloroacetic acid. Antisera were prepared by intravenous injection into rabbits of suspensions of whole organisms in solutions of bovine serum albumin, which had been heated and then washed. Four specific antigens were found as precipitinogens and denoted as antigens 11, 12, 13 and 14. Of 43 strains of L. acidophilus studied, 33 strains possessed antigen 11, six strains antigen 12, two strains antigen 13 and two strains antigen 14. Sugar compositions of wall preparations were analysed in an attempt to characterize the determinants of antigens 11 and 12. The walls contained glucose, galactose, hexosamine and sometimes glycerol, but no rhamnose was found. It was considered that alpha-glucopyranose was the major component of the determinant of antigen 11 since trehalose and maltose significantly inhibited the reaction between antibody 11 and its antigen; the determinant of antigen 12 was not clarified.
TI  - Changes in the microflora and physiology of the anterior intestinal tract of pigs weaned at 2 days, with special reference to the pathogenesis of diarrhea.
AB  - The gastrointestinal microflora and gastric physiology of piglets weaned at 2 days was compared with that of piglets allowed to continue sucking the sow. Although there was a significantly higher count of Escherichia coli in the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum of the early-weaned compared with sow-reared pigs, these differences were not detectable in samples from the ileum. There were no quantitative differences in lactobacilli and in streptococci between the two treatments. Lactobacillus fermentum, L. acidophilus, Streptococcus salivarius, S. bovis, and related biotypes were isolated from both groups of pigs. L. fermentum and S. salivarius were isolated more frequently from sow-reared piglets. The weight of digesta in the stomach was greater in weaned than in sucking pigs and was even greater in scouring weaned pigs, suggesting that in scouring pigs there may be gastric stasis. The gastric pH was higher in the weaned pigs at 4 days of age, but gradually decreased up to 10 days, during which time the lactic acid concentration rose. In weaned pigs there was a highly significant negative correlation between pH and lactic acid concentration in the stomach digesta, and also a positive correlation between pH and number of E. coli. These correlations suggest that lactic acid, from bacterial fermentation, is the major component in the regulation of gastric pH in weaned pigs. Three of twenty sucking pigs, but none of the weaned pigs, were secreting HCl (chloride concentration > 3 mg/g, pH < 3.5). In sucking pigs there was an inverse relationship between the chloride and lactic acid concentrations in the digesta. In weaned scouring pigs there was a nonsignificant increase in pepsin concentration in the stomach tissue. There was a threefold increase in the total proteolytic activity of the stomach tissue.

TI  - Alterations in fecal microflora enzymes related to diet, age, lactobacillus supplements, and dimethylhydrazine.
AB  - The bacterial enzymes, beta-glucuronidase, azoreductase, and nitroreductase, have been measured in the fecal microflora of rats. The effects of diet, advanced age, Lactobacillus acidophilus supplements, and dimethylhydrazine on these microbial enzymes activities have been determined. The shift from a grain to a meat diet resulted in 1.5--2.5-fold increase in the activity of all three enzymes. Animals over 20 months of age, consuming a meat diet, showed further increases in fecal beta-glucuronidase activity, while the levels of all three microbial enzymes increased in old rats fed a grain diet. Feeding supplement of L. acidophilus significantly lowered the activity of fecal nitroreductase and azoreductase in meat-eating animals, but had no effect on nitroreductase activity in grain-fed animals. Dimethylhydrazine increased the fecal beta-glucuronidase activity in both grain- and meat-fed animals, but the carcinogen had no effect on nitroreductase or azoreductase activity. These findings have relevance to known features of the epidemiology and etiology of large bowel cancer, and suggest certain approaches to prevention.
TI  - Comparative studies of lactate dehydrogenases in lactic acid bacteria. Amino-acid composition of an active-site region and chemical properties of the L-lactate dehydrogenase of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - The molecular weight, the amino acid composition and the N-terminal and C-terminal amino acids of two allosteric (Lactobacillus casei, L. curvatus) and two non-allosteric (L. plantarum, L. acidophilus) L-lactate dehydrogenases, purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography, were determined. The amino acid composition of the only tryptic peptide unequivocally common to the fingerprints of the 4 enzymes is virtually identical with that of the arginine peptide, called Arg6 of the the substratebinding site of the L-lactate dehydrogenase dehydrogenase of several animals. However, the 'essential' cysteine residue 165 is replaced by threonine, as it is in the L-lactate dehydrogenase of lobster. In addition, the 4 bacterial peptides differ by one or two changes in single amino acid residues from each other as well as from those of animals. The data indicate that not only the animal L-lactate dehydrogenases, but also the allosteric and lactate dehydrogenases from bacterial sources may have evolved from a common gene.

AB  - Phosphofructokinase (ATP : D-fructose-6-phosphate 1 phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.11) from two different lactobacilli, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus acidophilus were isolated and purified. Both enzymes have a molecular weight of 154 000 and consist of four subunits of identical size. Antisera from sheep immunized against the purified phosphofructokinase from L. plantarum showed immunologic cross reaction with the enzyme from L. acidophilus. In spite of the close molecular relationship indicated by the immunologic cross reaction, the kinetic behaviour of the two enzymes was strikingly different. Phosphofructokinase from L. plantarum showed pure Michaelis-Menten behaviour. Phosphofructokinase from L. acidophilus, however, showed sigmoidal substrate saturation curves for fructose 6-phosphate in the presence of slightly alkaline pH and high ATP concentrations; it was activated by fructose 1,6-biphosphate and inhibited by ADP. The results indicate that even enzymes which are structurally very similar may differ greatly with respect to their kinetic and regulatory properties and suggest that allosteric and non-allosteric phosphofructokinases have the same origin in evolution.

By the sensitivity spectra to bacteriocines L. ecidophilus cultures were divided into 76, L. salivarius--22, L. jugurti--15, and L. helveticus into 2 bacteriocines. By bacteriocine typing it was possible to differentiate into a number of bacteriocine types L. acidophilus and L. salivarius variants with the same biochemical and physiological properties.
TI  - Amino acid profiles and presumptive nutritional assessment of single-cell protein from certain lactobacilli.
AB  - The amino acid profiles, modified essential amino acid (MEAA) indexes, and in vitro pepsin digestibilities were determined for single-cell protein (SCP) from certain industrially important lactobacilli. For the three parameters examined, substantial differences were seen between different Lactobacillus species and between strains with a given species. SCP from all of the lactobacilli examined appeared relatively high in MEAA indexes and pepsin digestibility. SCP from L. acidophilus 3205 and L. fermenti 3954 had the highest MEAA indexes, whereas L. bulgaricus 2217 and L. thermophilus 3863 had the highest percentage of digestible crude protein. SCP from L. plantarum strains had the lowest MEAA indexes. The essential amino acid compositions of SCP from different lactobacilli appear comparable to that of Food and Agriculture Organization reference protein and SCP from other sources.

TI  - Distribution of indigenous Lactobacilli in the digestive tract of conventional and gnotobiotic rats.
AB  - Distribution of indigenous lactobacilli in the gastrointestinal tracts of rats was investigated at the species level. The indigenous lactobacilli isolated from conventional rats were divided into three groups, Lactobacillus acidophilus and its related strains, L. fermentum, and L. murini. Localization of the Lactobacillus groups in the gastrointestinal tracts could be distinguished clearly based on arabinose and glucose fermentation reaction of isolates from each part of the gastrointestinal tract. Group I (L. acidophilus and the related strains) and Group II (L. fermentum) were the major populations of lactobacilli on the walls of the non-glandular part and in the contents of the stomachs of both conventional and gnotobiotic rats. Group I predominated in all the parts of the digestive tract of conventional rats, whereas Group II was in the minority in the lower part of the gastrointestinal tracts of both groups of rats. Group III (L. murini) was the predominant population of Lactobacillus in the lower part of small intestine of conventional rats and in all parts of the gastrointestinal tracts of gnotobiotic rats except for the wall of the non-glandular part of the stomach.
TI  - Reduction of population levels of some indigenous bacteria by lactobacilli in the gastrointestinal tract of gnotobiotic rats.
AB  - Effects of each of three indigenous Lactobacillus groups on other bacterial populations were separately investigated in gnotobiotic rats. In the wall of the non-glandular part of the stomach, contents of the stomach and contents of the upper part of the small intestine, some pre-associated indigenous bacteria were reduced to conventional population levels by introducing three groups of lactobacilli: Group I (Lactobacillus acidophilus and related strains), Group II (L. fermentum) and the groups mixed. However, no obvious reduction in cell numbers of the pre-associated bacteria occurred in the case of Group III (L. murini).
TI  - Deconjugation of bile acids by intestinal lactobacilli.
AB  - Lactobacillus species normally found in the intestinal tract of humans varied in  the ability to deconjugate bile acids, whereas laboratory strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus deconjugated both glycocholate and taurocholate. All isolates of L. acidophilus from human feces deconjugated taurocholate, whereas only one of six deconjugated glycocholate. None of 13 isolates identified as L. casei deconjugated taurocholate, whereas 9 deconjugated glycocholate. The deconjugating system of L. acidophilus appeared to be constitutive, required low oxidation-reduction potential, and was most active at pH 6. No degradation beyond deconjugation was detected.
TI  - Proteolytic activity of Streptococcus mutans (GS-5).
AB  - The potential proteolytic ability of cariogenic streptococci was assessed in a strain of Streptococcus mutans (GS-5). Blood-borne S. mutans from rats infected by mouth with GS-5 were cultured, and sterile rat tail tendons were placed on these cultured bacterial colonies. The collagenolytic ability of these organisms was examined under the scanning electron microscope and by testing for reduced tensile strength of the collagen fibers. These experiments showed that GS-5 cariogenic streptococcus can be conditioned to produce significant collagenolytic activity.

TI  - Control of and synthesis in Lactobacillus acidophilus Role of RNA and free amino  acids.
AB  - In Lactobacillus acidophilus, the DNA synthesis in cells incubated in the absence of essential amino acids reaches levels corresponding to the initiation of further replication cycles than just to completing the cycles already running. This "relaxation of DNA synthesis" is stimulated by the presence of inhibitors of protein synthesis and by the presence of deoxyadenylate. These enhancements of DNA replication are cancelled by actinomycin D. In the presence of inhibitors of protein synthesis, the relaxtion of DNA synthesis is further stimulated by free amino acids. The effect of free amino acids, unlike in the former cases, is not inhibited by actinomycin D. It proposed that the chromosome replication in Lactobacillus acidophilus is regulated similarly as in some plasmids, i.e. independently of the synthesis of protein, depending on the synthesis of RNA and, in addition, on the presence of free amino acids.

AB  - With the new method the fecal flora of 13 clinically healthy dogs aged 3 to 42 months was analysed qualitatively and quantitatively. It was characterized by that bacteroidaceae constituted the most prodominant flora, catenabacteria, streptococci, peptostreptococci, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria were the next most numerous, enterobacteria consisted the accompanying flora. The numbers of Clostridium perfringens were remarkably fluctuated and seem to be influenced by the composition of the food ingested by the host. The total cultivable counts averaged log 10.8 +/- 0.2/g. The composition of the Lactobacillus flora and Bifidobacterium flora in the feces of 34 dogs from 3 different age groups was analysed. In the feces of all age groups L. acidophilus, L. salivarius and L. fermenti with 9 different types were found. Within the lactobacilli L. acidophilus type VI c, L. salivarius type VI a and L. fermenti type IV b were most frequently found. L. acidophilus types VI c and XI, L. salivarius types VI a and VI b could not be placed in any established types of each species, and were described as new types. Bifidobacteria were regularly found in large numbers in the feces of dogs aged 2 to 24 months. B. adolescentis and B. pseudolongum consisted the main Bifidobacterium flora.

It was found that the cultures of L. casei were sensitive to 30 types of bacteriocins, while the cultures of L. plantarum were sensitive to 9 bacteriocin types. 89.6 per cent of the cultures of L. casei and all cultures of L. plantarum were sensitive to one or several bacteriocins produced by Lactobacilli of different species.

AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus R-26 a strain deficient in ribonucleotide reductase, was grown with [G-14C]deoxycytidine as the only source of deoxyribose in the medium. Of the radioactivity incorporated into deoxyribonucleic acid, a fifth moved directly into deoxyribonucleic acid deoxycytidylate, without deamination. Furthermore, deoxycytidine and thymidine nucleotides had similar sugar/base ratios, suggesting a direct conversion of deoxycytidine nucleotides to thymidine nucleotides through deamination, without further dilution by glycosyl transfer. Although radioactivity was incorporated into both the sugar and base moieties of deoxyribonucleic acid pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotides, only the sugar moiety of purine deoxyribonucleotides was labeled. Purine deoxyribonucleotides probably were synthesized by glycosyl transfer from [G-14C]deoxycytidine to unlabeled purines, followed by phosphorylation of the deoxynucleotides.

TI  - Intestinal pH and propulsion: an explanation of diarrhoea in lactase deficiency and laxation by lactulose.
AB  - Subjects deficient in lactase may experience bloating, cramps and diarrhoea after ingesting milk, due to the unhydrolysed and poorly-absorbed lactose. The diarrhoea may result from an osmotic effect of the lactose itself or its poorly-absorbed acidic products of fermentation (Weijers, van de Kamer & others, 1961; Christopher & Bayless, 1971), possibly together with an alteration of sodium and water absorption due to the lowered colonic pH (Rousseau & Sladen, 1971). Laxation by lactulose (1-4-beta-galactosidofructose) may operate through an analogous mechanism. The drug is a synthetic dissaccharide which, in oral doses of 10-20 g, relieves chronic constipation (Wesselius-de Casparis, Braadbaart & others, 1968). It is neither hydrolysed by intestinal dissaccharidase (Dahlqvist & Gryboski, 1965) nor absorbed in the gut, but it is converted in the colon mainly to lactic and acetic acids by various bacteria including Lactobacillus acidophilus. Apart from the increased osmotic effect, the pH in the proximal colon falls markedly (Bown, Gibson & others, 1974), and larger doses may reduce stool pH. Weijers & others (1961) inferred that the acidic products formed from lactose in the colon stimulate propulsion, and K.S. Liem (Philips-Duphar) suggested to us that lactulose may relieve constipation partly by stimulation of propulsion due to the lowered pH. The experiments described below support this view.
TI  - Adherence of bacterial to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  - Vaginal epithelial cells from healthy women were washed and incubated in tissue culture medium with freshly isolated bacteria of the indigenous vaginal flora and with bacteria of species that have been discussed in conjunction with genital infections. After incubation and washing, the number of bacteria that adhered per cell was determined. The influence on the attachment rate of such factors as variations in the washing procedure, bacterial density, and incubation time was assessed. Lactobacillus acidophilus and other bacterial species that occur in the lower genital tract of healthy women, e.g., some strictly anaerobic species, adhered by significantly lower numbers per cell than Neisseria gonorrhoeae, group B streptococci, and Corynebacterium vaginale. Significantly more freshly isolated gonococci adhered per cell than gonococci that had been passaged on artificial medium. The adherence of gonococci increased with increasing acidity of the test medium.

TI  - Microorganisms and characteristics of laban.
AB  - Laban had a titratable acidity of about 1.0%, a pH of 4.25, an ethanol content of 1.25%, and contained 4.2 mug acetaldehyde and 34 mug acetoin/ml. There was no diacetyl. Five microorganisms, classified as Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Leuconostoc lactis, Kluyveromyces fragilis, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, were responsible for the fermentation. Streptococcus thermophilus and L. acidophilus were responsible for acid production with S. thermophilus producing acid more rapidly. Most of the acetaldehyde was produced by K. fragilis, little ethanol was found in absence of S. cerevisiae, and the acetoin was producted by S. thermophilus.
TI  - Deconjugation of bile acids by human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The purpose of this report is to present the deconjugation of bile acids by numbers of strains of bacteria in the small intestine and feces. The small intestinal juice was aseptically aspirated by a double lumen tube with a rubber cover on the tip devised by us ("Fukushima Type 1"). Bile acids were analyzed with thin layer chromatography. THE RESULTS: 1) Among aerobic bacteria, species of which all of the strains split conjugated bile acids was enterococcus, and most of the strains split were Staphylococcus (S.) epidermidis and Lactobacillus (L.) bifidus. Species of which none of the strains split were Escherichia (E.) coli, E. communior, E. freundii, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. buchneri, L. cellobiosus, L. bulgaricus, S. aureus, Aerobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida, proteus, serratia, and almost none of the species split was Intermediate coliform bacilli. 2) Among anaerobic bacteria, species of which all of the strains split were Bacteroides (B.) vulgatus, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. uniformis, Corynebacterium (C.) granulosum, C. avidum, Peptostreptococcus (Peptostrept.) putridus, Eubacterium (Eubact.) lentum, Peptococcus (Pept.) grigoroffii, Pept. anaerobius, Veillonella (V.) orbiculus, and most of the strains split were Coryne. diphtheroides, Eubact. parvum, Peptostrept. intermedius. Species of which none of the strains split were Coryne, parvum, Peptostrept. micros, V. alcalescens, V. parvula, Catenabacterium (Catena.) catenaforme, and Catena. filamentosum. 3) All or none, or almost all or none, of the strains of each species tested split conjugated bile acids, and it seems probably that the presence or absence of this ability would be a proper character of eachspecies.

TI  - Death of Lactobacillus acidophilus caused by incorporated 3H-thymine during incubation without amino acids.
AB  - Of the cells of Lactobacillus acidophilus R-26 incorporated 3H-thymine (specific  radioactivity 1.57 Ci/mmol or 3.15 Ci/mmol), their transfer to a medium without essential amino acids resulted in their death. This death may be interpreted in such a way that cell damage caused by disintegration of tritium cannot be effectively repaired under conditions of amino acid deprivation. The experimental eonditions make it possible to explain this death either as a result of inhibition of protein or RNA synthesis or as a result of the absence of amino acids. These possibilities were tested in experiments, in which the synthesis of proteins and RNA was inhibited by specific inhibitors in the presence of amino acids. Under these conditions no death of cells was detected, thus indicating that free amino acids play a role in the repair of radiation damage.

TI  - The influence of intestinal (ceca) flora on serum and egg yolk cholesterol levels in laying hens.
AB  - Normal and cecectomized laying hens were used to study the influence of intestinal (ceca) flora and the implantation of Lactobacillus acidophylus on the levels of serum and egg yolk cholesterol. The ceca had been surgically removed when the experimental birds were 16 months of age. Serum cholesterol levels of cecectomized laying hens were higher than that of normal birds; the Lactobacillus acidophylus implantation resulted in a significant decrease in serum cholesterol levels in both normal and cecectomized birds. The normal intestinal (ceca) flora and Lactobacillus acidophylus implantation did not influence fat digestibility. Egg yolk cholesterol levels were higher for cecectomized birds. A constant relationship between serum and egg yolk cholesterol was not observed.
TI  - Enterotoxigenic intestinal bacteria in tropical sprue. IV. Effect of linoleic acid on growth interrelationships of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - The factors responsible for colonization of the small intestine by enterotoxigenic coliform bacteria in Puerto Ricans with tropical sprue are unknown, but epidemiological observations have suggested that they may be related to an increased dietary intake of long-chain unsaturated fatty acids, particularly linoleic acid, which is known to exert an inhibitory effect on the growth of gram-positive organisms that normally comprise the flora of the small intestine. We have examined, by using a glucose-limited continuous-culture system, what effect this fatty acid exerts on the growth relationships of enteric gram-positive and coliform bacteria. In this system, colonization by an invading strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae was prevented by the presence of an established culture of Lactobacillus acidophilus, principally by virtue of a lowered pH of the medium that was incompatible with Klebsiella growth. However, when the population density of L. acidophilus was reduced by the presence of a sufficient concentration of linoleic acid, the invading K. pneumoniae successfully colonized the system and, once established, suppressed the growth of L. acidophilus. These observations indicate that, under the conditions of our chemostat, gram-positive enteric bacteria suppress coliform growth and that this effect is reversible by the presence of linoleic acid. It remains to be established, however, what pertinence these in vitro observations have to conditions within the intestinal tract of persons living in the tropics.
TI  - Detection of Lactobacillus acidophilus in feces of humans, pigs, and chickens.
AB  - Lactobacilli in fecal material from humans, pigs, and chickens were enumerated on lactobacillus selective agar (LBS). In all samples, higher numbers of lac-tobacilli were detected when plates were incubated in a system flushed with CO2 rather than in air. Much higher numbers of bacteria from human feces were detected when the LBS agar plates were incubated anaerobically in a hydrogen-carbon dioxide atmosphere (GasPak) than when incubated in CO2. The bacteria from human feces isolated on LBS agar incubated anaerobically were predominately bifidobacteria. Cultures from all three sources isolated on LBS agar incubated under CO2 were lactobacilli, including Lactobacillus acidophilus. Differences were observed in biochemical characteristics of some of the L. acidophilus isolated from all three sources. Guanine plus cytosine base ratios of deoxyribonucleic acid isolated from L. acidophilus cultures from humans were lower, in most cases, than those from pigs and chickens.

TI  - [The fecal flora of man. III. Communication: The composition of Lactobacillus flora of different age groups (author's transl)].
AB  - From fecal flora of 66 infants aged 3 to 220 days, 29 children aged 4 to 6 years, 42 adults aged 20 to 64 years and 21 senile persons aged 65 to 86 years, the Lactobacillus flora was analysed qualitatively and quantitatively. In the feces of babies only the resident lactobacilli (L. acidophilus, L. salivarius and L. fermenti) were found, while in the feces of children, adults and senile persons the resident lactobacilli as well as the transient lactobacilli (L. casei, L. plantarum, L. brevis, L. buchneri and L. lactis) were found simultaneously. Within the Lactobacillus species L. acidophilus type I, L. fermenti type IVa and L. salivarius type Ia were most frequently found in the feces of all age groups. In addition, L. acidophilus type X was also often found in the feces of senile persons. In connection with the numbers of species or types of lactobacilli in one fecal specimen, one or two species or types were demonstrated in 94,5% of positive cases of infants. With increasing age the numbers increased, especially more than three species or types were demonstrated in 85% of positive cases. In infants in 3 different clinics, clinic-specificities were demonstrated in relation to the species or types of lactobacilli isolated: in each clinic clearly certain species or types of lactobacilli were present. The results indicate that the composition of the Lactobacillus flora in the feces is influenced by lactobacilli orally ingested.

TI  - [Ability of lactobacilli in the human microflora to produce lysozyme].
AB  - Lysozyme activity of 403 strains of lactobacilli were investigated; of these 26 were from foreign sets and 377 were isolated from the contents of the stomach, feces and vaginal discharge of healthy adults. The species reference of lactobacillae was confirmed by the results of study of their physiologo-biochemical properties with the aid of 45 tests. A method of agar plates was adapted to determination of lysozyme: the autoclaved suspension of Micrococcus lysodeikticus (strain No. 2665) was added to the agar medium MPC-I, and lactobacilli were cultivated for 4 days in the CO2 atmosphere at 37 degrees C. There was revealed the capacity of L. fermenti and L. brevis to produce lysozyme; in L. fermenti the lysozyme activity was much more frequent (p less than 0.001); strains of the rest of the species of lactobacilli differentiated by the Rogosa and Sharpe's classification proved to be lysozyme-negative. It was shown that the lactobacilli of the L. fermenti species, included into the microflora of the intestine and the vagina of healthy adults as a rule possessed lysozyme activity. L. fermenti strain 90T-S4 used in the production of dry lactobacterin also produced lysozyme. All this favours an important role of L. fermenti in the protective function of the microflora.

TI  - N-6-(delta-2-isopentenyl) adenosine: hydrolysis by a mucleosidase isolated from Lactobacillus acidophilus cells.
AB  - A nucleosidase activity has been isolated from Lactobacillus acidophilus which rapidly hydrolyses N-6 (delta-2-isopentenyl) adenosine to its corresponding base, N-6(delta-2-isopentenyl) adenine. The activity can be distinguished from the spleen exzyme (EC. 2.4.2.1), a purine nucleoside transferase, on the basis of its substrate specificity, electrophoretic behavior, and nondependence on phosphate. The bacterial enzyme hydrolyzes both inosine and isopentenyl adenosine, giving Km values of 63.3muM and 177 muM respectively. The presence of this enzyme in bacteria counts for the rapid conversion of the parent nucleoside to isopentenyl adenine, which has been observed in these cells. The enzyme thus assumes importance as one of the catabolic activities available to the cell for metabolizing the cytokinin, N-6-(delta-2-isopentenyl) adenosine.
TI  - Eimeria brunetti in epithelial cells of the bursa of Fabricius in gnotobiotic chickens.

TI  - Effects of cadmium on the growth and uptake of cadmium by microorganisms.
AB  - Six species of microorganisms, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis and Actinomyces niger, were grown under suitable conditions in appropriate media. Cadmium chloride was added to provide 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 mug of Cd per ml. At 40 and 80 mug of Cd per ml, E. coli and B. cereus grew well and the other species were repressed. Cd uptake patterns differed significantly among the species tested. The significance of these data with respect to Cd in food chains is discussed.

TI  - Participation of exogenous thymine and thymidine in deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis in Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - The degree of participation (DP) of exogenous thymidine and thymine in overall DNA synthesis was studied in Lactobacillus acidophilus R-26. The DP of thymidine remains constant under a variety of conditions (except at low thymidine concentrations, when the DP is influenced by deoxyribonucleosides and folic acid). A 5-bromodeoxyuridine-resistant mutant was isolated, which displayed cross-resistance to 5-bromouracil and a significantly lower DP of thymidine than the parental strain. Thymine was poorly incorporated in the parental strain even in the presence of deoxyribosides. The results of this investigation would be compatible with the possibility of an alternative pathway for thymidylate synthesis other than the known thymidylate synthase pathway.

AB  - An IgA phosphorylcholine (PC)-binding myeloma protein with IgCH allotypic determinants different from those of BALB/c mice is characterized. The myeloma, CBPC 2, was induced in the CB-20 strain of mice which is congenic to BALB/c but differs from it by carrying the A15 allotypic determinant of C57BL/ka mice. Sequence analysis of the CBPC 2 light chain through the first hypervariable region, as well as isoelectric point analysis, show that this chain is indistinguishable from that of T15, a PC-binding myeloma protein of BALB/c origin. The heavy chains of CBPC 2 and T15 differ by only two amino acids (positions 14 and 16) through the first hypervariable region. As measured by inhibition of precipitation, both CBPC 2 and T15 have the same specificity for PC, glycerophosphorylcholine, acetylcholine, and choline. In addition, CBPC 2 possesses the binding site-associated idiotypic determinant which is present on T15. However, like normal or induced C57BL/6 anti-PC antibody, it does not possess the nonbinding site idiotypic determinant.
TI  - Turnover of the cell wall peptidoglycan of Lactobacillus acidophilus. The presence of a fraction immune to turnover.
AB  - Exponentially growing cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus strain 60AM Gasser were previously shown to lose about one-third of their cell wall peptidoglycan per generation via turnover (Boothby, D., Daneo-Moore, L., Higgins, M. L., Coyette, J., and Shockman, G. D. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 2161-2169). We now show that 20 to 30% of the [3H]lysine initially present in insoluble peptidoglycan fractions was retained after 4 or more generations of continued exponential growth of cultures in the absence of label. Treatment of peptidoglycan fractions, before and after 6 or 8 generations of chase with lysozyme (EC 3.2.1.17), released soluble products containing [3H]lysine which had electrophoretic mobilities identical with the disaccharide-peptide derivatives obtained from the wall peptidoglycan of this species. Because protein is known to contaminate peptidoglycan residues, the double labeled technique was used to show that one-half or less of the label lysine present after 6 or 8 generations of chase could be attributed to protein contamination. This then left a minimum fraction of 10 to 20% of the peptidoglycan that was immune to turnover. The absence of turnover of peptidoglycan labeled during short pulses has now been quantitated to show that pulses shorter than 12% of a generation (6 to 7 min) did not turn over. This turnover-immune fraction is in reasonably good agreement with the immune fraction of 10 to 20% observed after long periods of chase of extensively labeled peptidoglycan.
TI  - Transmission of Lactobacillus jensenii and Lactobacillus acidophilus from mother  to child at time of delivery.
AB  - The presence of Lactobacillus jensenii and Lactobacillus acidophilus has been studied in specimens from the rectum and vagina of the mother, from the mouth of the infant at the time of delivery, and from the mouth and rectum of infants six days of age. L. jensenii could be differentiated from other species of lactobacilli by the following combination of characteristics: production of only D-lactate, hydrolysis of arginine, and fermentation of cellobiose, galactose, and ribose, but not of lactose. L. jensenii and L. acidophilus were common inhabitants of the vagina. In spite of a contamination of the infant's mouth by L. jensenii and L. acidophilus during delivery, neither of these organisms became established in the mouth of the newborn infants.
TI  - Effects of Eimeria brunetti on intestinal pH in conventional and gnotobiotic chickens.
AB  - White Leghorn cockerels, 2-4 weeks of age, inoculated with sporulated oocysts of  Eimeria brunetti had a lower mean pH in the middle and lower small intestine than did uninoculated controls by 5-9 days post-inoculation. No effect of the infection on pH was seen in the upper intestine while pH in the gizzard and caeca was occasionally higher than in controls. Magnitude of pH. decrease did not correlate with increases in oocyst dosage and severity of infection as measured by lesion score. Studies with germ-free (GF) and gnotobiotic chicks showed that host bacterial flora was essential for a pH decrease in the middle and lower small intestine with E. brunetti infection. Inoculation of GF birds with Lactobacillus acidophilus or L. acidophilus plus Streptococcus faecalis, in addition to E. brunetti resulted in some decrease in pH.

AB  - Mutanolysin partially purified from the culture filtrate of Streptomyces globisporus 1829 consists of two main lytic enzymes with an isoelectric point near pH 8.5 and 10, respectively, and proteolytic enzyme is associated with the latter lytic enzyme. Mutanolysin exhibited maximal lytic activity at 60 C in the pH range 6.5 to 7.0 and was stable at 50 C in the acid range. N-bromosuccinimide caused complete inhibition of lytic activity at 1 mM, whereas calcium and magnesium ions at the same concentration caused activation. Mutanolysin had lytic or bactericidal activity against the living cells of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Actinomyces viscosus, which are considered to be etiologic agents of dental caries, but had no activity against S. aureus and all gram-negative strains tested. The lytic activity was well retained in human saliva. Digestion of the cell walls of S. mutans BHT by mutanolysin was accompanied by the liberation of free amino groups and reducing sugars. Mutanolysin may be expected to be a useful agent for dental caries control.

Antisera were prepared against C. vaginale ATCC strain 14018 grown diphasically and on blood agar plates and were tested against extracts of organisms prepared by sonication. Ouchterlony analysis demonstrated that all of the isolates of C. vaginale examined possess a common antigenic determinant. No antigenic relationship was detected between C. vaginale and members of the genera Corynebacterium or Lactobacillus. This study also demonstrated that alterations in the cultural conditions can cause variations in the antigenic composition of C. vaginale.

AB  - Ultrastructural changes which occur during cellular autolysis of Lactobacillus acidophilus strain 63AM Gasser in 0.05 M citrate buffer, pH 5.0, were examined. Early in the process, randomly distributed electron-dense patches were seen on the wall surface, along with an accompanying eversion of mesosomes. Later, after a loss of about 20% of the initial cellular turbidity, dissolution from the outside of nascent cross walls was seen. This observation was related to the normal process of cell separation. After this stage, short lengths of the cylindrical portion of the wall appeared to be completely removed in a random manner over the entire surface. This dissolution produced gaps in the wall which allowed the extrusion of membrane and cytoplasm. Although membrane was usually extruded through one major, polar, subpolar, or septal site, other secondary points of membrane extrusion were also frequently seen in the same cell section.

AB  - The indirect fluorescent-antibody technique was employed in an attempt to develop a rapid method of identification of Corynebacterium vaginale. Six reference strains and ten clinical isolates selected on the basis of morphology and conventional biochemical tests were compared. Antisera were prepared in rabbits against the six reference strains. The most satisfactory antiserum was that prepared using strain 14018 grown diphasically (14018 Di) as the antigen. Certain of the antisera did exhibit a cross-reacting titer when reacted against Corynebacterium diptheriae, Corynebacterium xerosis, or Lactobacillus acidophilus. However, antisera adsorbed with these bacteria did not exhibit a significant decrease in titer when reacted against the homologous strain. Various other species of Corynebacterium as well as species of Nocardia, Actinomyces, Hemophilus, and Streptococcus did not fluoresce with the antisera. A specific antiserum was prepared by adsorbing anti-14018 Di with L. acidophilus. The adsorption removed the cross-reacting antibody but did not affect the staining reaction with C. vaginale strains. All reference strains and clinical isolates characterized as C. vaginale gave a definite positive reaction with the adsorbed anti-14018 Di. The specificity of the reactions was assessed by adsorbing the antiserum with the homologous strain. The data suggest that the indirect staining method will be of value in the rapid presumptive identification of C. vaginale.

AB  - The autolytic N-acetylmuramidase present in Lactobacillus acidophilus strain 63 AM Gasser has an optimal pH between 5 and 6 when lysing intact cells or isolated cell walls. Cellular lysis at pH 5 is two to four times more rapid in citrate buffer of 0.01 M and 0.5 M or higher than in 0.1 M acetate buffer. It seems that sulfhydryl groups are required for both cell and wall autolysis. Heavy metal ions and p-chloro-mercuribenzoate, at low concentrations, are powerful inhibitors. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid stimulates cellular but not wall autolysis in acetate buffer to the level obtained in citrate buffer. The possible involvement of sulfhydryl groups in a mechanism of control of cellular autolytic activity is discussed. The autolytic enzyme, although unstable in solution at 37 C, can be extracted from walls by the use of solutions of bovine serum albumin (100 mug/ml) in 0.01 N NaOH. Soluble enzyme extracted from walls rebinds on to sodium decylsulfate-treated walls, but three times as much of the wall material is required to completely re-adsorb the activity.

TI  - Cytological and deoxyribonucleic acid-deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization studies on lactobacillus isolates from San Francisco sourdough.
AB  - Molecular taxonomic and electron microscopy studies were performed on four bacterial isolates obtained from different sources of San Francisco sourdough (SD). These bacteria were first isolated by Kline and Sugihara who tentatively described them as a previously unreported species of heterofermentative Lactobacillus; they suggested the name Lactobacillus sanfrancisco. The guanine plus cytosine base composition (%GC) of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) ranged from 38 to 40%. The possible genetic relatedness of these SD isolates to five known species of Lactobacillus with comparable GC contents was assessed in the present work by means of DNA-DNA hybridization competition experiments. Little or no DNA homology was observed between the SD bacteria and the known species. The SD bacteria exhibited a high degree of homology (>88%) among themselves, suggesting that the four isolates were identical taxonomically. Also, the electron photomicrographs revealed structures similar to those of gram-positive bacilli. Accordingly, since these SD isolates have the characteristic phenotypic and morphological properties of the genus Lactobacillus and are not related genetically to any known species, the tentative characterization by the above workers of these isolates as a new species is substantiated.
TI  - Fractionation of dipeptidase activities of Streptococcus lactis and dipeptidase specificity of some lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Proteins in sonic extracts of Streptococcus lactis were separated by starch-gel electrophoresis at high voltage. Each slab was sliced longitudinally, and half was stained for peptidases in a mixture containing a peptide, L-amino acid oxidase (snake venom), peroxidase, and o-dianisdine; the other half was stained in amido black for protein. In addition to sonic treatment, trypsin also released enzyme from acetone-treated cells. Glycyl-L-phenylalanine, L-phenylalanyl-glycine, L-alanyl-L-phenylalanine, and L-phenylalanyl-L-alanine served as substrates in characterizing the enzymes. Five different fractions of various specificities appeared in the gels. Broad-range substrate specificities were found for sonic extracts of S. lactis, S. cremoris, S. durans, and Lactobacillus acidophilus.

AB  - Thyroxine (T(4)) and triiodothyronine (T(9)) are rapidly degraded by a purified preparation of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and H(2)O(2) with the formation of iodide and material which remains at the origin on paper chromatography. Deiodination by MPO and H(2)O(2) occurs more readily at pH 7.0 than at pH 5.0 in contrast to iodination by this system which is known to occur more readily at pH 5.0 than at pH 7.0. Degradation is inhibited by azide, cyanide, ascorbic acid, and propylthiouracil. Methimazole stimulates deiodination by MPO and H(2)O(2) but inhibits this reaction when MPO is replaced by lactoperoxidase or horseradish peroxidase.Intact human leukocytes, in the resting state, degrade T(4) and T(3) slowly: degradation, however, is increased markedly during phagocytosis of preopsonized particles. Serum inhibits this reaction. T(3) can be detected as a minor product of T(4) degradation. Proteolytic digestion of the reaction products increases the recovery of monoiodotyrosine. The fixation of iodine in the cytoplasm of leukocytes which contain ingested bacteria was detected radioautographically. Chronic granulomatous disease leukocytes, which are deficient in H(2)O(2) formation, degrade T(4) and T(3) poorly during phagocytosis. MPO-deficient leukocytes degrade the thyroid hormones at a slower rate than do normal leukocytes although considerable degradation is still observed. Azide, cyanide, ascorbic acid, and propylthiouracil which inhibit certain peroxidasecatalyzed reactions inhibit degradation by normal leukocytes; however, inhibition is incomplete. Formation of iodinated origin material is inhibited to a greater degree by azide, cyanide, and propylthiouracil than is deiodination. Methimazole inhibits the formation of iodinated origin material by both normal and MPO-deficient leukocytes. However, deiodination by normal leukocytes is stimulated and that of MPO-deficient leukocytes is unaffected by methimazole. Hypoxia inhibits the degradation of T(4) and T(3) by untreated normal or MPO-deficient leukocytes and by normal leukocytes treated with azide or methimazole. These data suggest that both MPO-dependent and MPO-independent systems are involved in the degradation of T(4) and T(3) by phagocytosing leukocytes. The role of leukocytic degradation of T(4) and T(3) in thyroid hormone economy and in leukocytic microbicidal activity is considered.

All six bacteria quickly established themselves in the gastrointestinal tract of the germfree rat, and all six increased the animals' total serum proteins. Only S. aureus and P. aeruginosa caused a noticeable rise in gamma globulins. L. acidophilus, S. faecalis, and B. fragilis multiplied readily in the gastrointestinal tract but caused only minimal alterations in the serum proteins. P. vulgaris caused a marked increase in the alpha and beta, but not the gamma globulins.

TI  - Lactobacillus exonuclease mutants: selection of mutants with altered ability to utilize deoxyribonucleotides.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus R-26, which requires preformed deoxyriboside for its growth, is able to grow in a basal medium supplemented with nitrophenyl esters of thymidine 3'- and 5'-phosphates. Mutants unable to grow on the thymidine phosphate esters were isolated and classified thus far into two classes. One class of mutants that are unable to grow on the diesters have modified exonucleases, their extracts being unable to hydrolyze the specific nitrophenyl ester on which the strain did not grow. It appears therefore, that the known 3'- and 5'-exonucleases specifically hydrolyzing these esters can be used for the support of growth. A second mutagenization treatment of one of the mutants gave rise to a new strain unable to use or hydrolyze either diester for growth, although it could still grow on several deoxyribodinucleotides. Another class of mutants does not grow on deoxyribooligonucleotides but grows on monodeoxyribo-nucleosides and -nucleotides. These mutants have normal levels of exonuclease activities, so it appears possible that they bear a mutation affecting permeability to diesters or to molecules larger than mononucleotides.
TI  - Microstructure of colonies of rod-shaped bacteria.
AB  - Whole colonies of Bacillus cereus, B. megaterium, B. mycoides CN2495, Corynebacterium hofmanni NCTC1938, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus acidophilus NCIB1899, Nocardia graminis NCTC4728, Pseudomonas viscosa, and Serratia marcescens were prepared for scanning electron microscopic examination by freeze-drying and metal-coating. The arrangement of individual cells within colonies could be seen. Cells of Bacillus colonies tended to be longer than in liquid culture and irregular in shape and to give the appearance of branching. B. megaterium colonies frequently had a dense covering film. Colonies of gram-negative bacteria consisted of fairly short rods covered by much adherent extracellular material. L. acidophilus had colonies comprised of densely packed, well-oriented rods. C. hofmanni colonies contained coccobacilli, packed together. Correlations were observed between plano-convex colony form and densely packed cells, rough colony form and random arrangement of well-separated microorganisms, and irregular colony edge and tendency of cells to grow out from the colony in filaments.
TI  - Nicotinamide deamidation by microorganisms in rat stomach.
AB  - We have extended our investigation of nicotinamide deamidation in the stomach of  conventional rats. The bacterial species in the pars preventricularis were identified as Flavobacterium peregrinum, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, and Lactobacillus acidophilus, listed in order of decreasing deamidase activity. Nicotinamide-7-(14)C ingested into rat stomach was rapidly deamidated to nicotinic acid. These results contribute to the accumulated evidence that microorganisms present in the pars preventricularis of rat stomach are responsible for the deamidation of nicotinamide to nicotinic acid, a known precursor of mammalian pyridine nucleotides.

AB  - Antisera were prepared against pure nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent d-lactic dehydrogenases of Lactobacillus leichmannii, L. jensenii, and L. fermenti. When tested against these three antisera, crude extracts of almost all species of Lactobacillus containing a d-lactic dehydrogenase give cross-reactions. Extensive pairwise comparisons between cross-reacting crude extracts by double diffusion experiments permit the recognition of groups of identical antigenic specificity among the lactic dehydrogenases of the various nomenspecies of Lactobacillus. The same groups are revealed by each of the three antisera. By analyses of spur formation, the groups of identical antigenic specificity can be arranged in order of decreasing similarity to the homologous d-lactic dehydrogenase used as the reference point. From the combined results obtained with the three antisera, a map of the antigenic relationships among the d-lactic dehydrogenases of lactobacilli can be constructed. Microcomplement fixation experiments with two of the three anti-d-lactic dehydrogenases antisera support the conclusions drawn from double diffusion experiments and provide a quantitative estimation of the antigenic relationships among the various d-lactic dehydrogenases. An antiserum was also prepared against the pure l-lactic dehydrogenase of L. acidophilus group III. It cross-reacts with extracts of almost all lactobacilli containing an l-lactic dehydrogenase. With respect to species that contain both d- and l-lactic dehydrogenases, this antiserum reveals the same groups of identical antigenic specificity as do the antisera directed against d-lactic dehydrogenases. Other than the genus Lactobacillus, only extracts of Leuconostoc cross-react with anti-d-lactic dehydrogenase. No extrageneric cross-reactions were obtained with the anti-l-lactic dehydrogenase.

AB  - Eight IgA myeloma proteins derived from independently induced plasma-cytomas in genetically similar inbred BALB/c mice are functionally related by their binding of phosphoryl choline-containing antigens (Pneumococcus C polysaccharide or Lactobacillus antigen). Each protein resembles a single species of immunoglobulin in antibody. The proteins are characterized by highly sensitive myeloma-specific antisera prepared by immunizing mice of other inbred strains with the BALB/c myeloma proteins. Individual or myeloma-specific determinants located on Fab fragments were found on three of the proteins that were unique for that protein and did not react with any other IgA protein among over 70 tested. Remarkably, five of the proteins shared two common myeloma-specific determinants which were specific for this group of five proteins. These results suggest that the five functionally and genetically related proteins sharing the same myeloma-specific determinants might also be structurally similar.
TI  - Myeloperoxidase: contribution to the microbicidal activity of intact leukocytes.
AB  - Azide and, to a lesser extent, cyanide inhibit the microbicidal activity of myeloperoxidase and of intact normal leukocytes, but they have little or no effect on peroxidase-negative leukocytes. The contribution of the azide-sensitive (peroxidase-dependent?) systems to the total microbicidal activity of normal leukocytes is considerable. The azide-insensitive antimicrobial systems are more highly developed in peroxidase-negative leukocytes than in normal leukocytes, thus suggesting an adaptation.

TI  - Effect of actinomycin D on the transfer of ribonucleic acid from nucleus to cytoplasm in Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - After starvation for deoxyribosides, the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of Lactobacillus acidophilus is restricted to a localized region of the cell. (3)H-uracil is first incorporated into such a restricted region but subsequently is found throughout the cell. This spread occurs despite the absence of protein synthesis and a major reduction in the rate of ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis. However, blocking RNA synthesis with actinomycin D restricts incorporation to a localized region of the cell. It is concluded that uracil is first incorporated into RNA in the bacterial nucleus from which it subsequently spreads through the cell. Actinomycin D could prevent this spread by preventing the completion of RNA molecules, which therefore do not dissociate from the DNA template.

With the improved data obtained in this study, the specific groupings of the species of both genera were reevaluated.

TI  - Antibacterial activity of the purified peroxidase from human parotid saliva.
AB  - The peroxidase of human parotid saliva has been purified by concentration, gel filtration on Sephadex G-200, and ion exchange chromatography on Amberlite CG-50. The purified product was devoid of amylase activity, lysozyme activity, and immunoglobulin A (IgA). However, it had an inhibitory effect on the growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus in complete growth medium and on lysine accumulation by L. acidophilus in a buffer-glucose medium, when combined with thiocyanate ions. The concentrations of peroxidase and thiocyanate ions employed were within the range found in saliva. The fractions which contained IgA did not have an anti-bacterial effect on L. acidophilus under the conditions employed. Parotid saliva also contained low molecular weight inhibitors of peroxidase activity. These studies support the involvement of the salivary peroxidase in an antibacterial system in saliva.
TI  - Myeloperoxidase-halide-hydrogen peroxide antibacterial system.
AB  - An antibacterial effect of myeloperoxidase, a halide, such as iodide, bromide, or chloride ion, and H(2)O(2) on Escherichia coli or Lactobacillus acidophilus is described. When L. acidophilus was employed, the addition of H(2)O(2) was not required; however, the protective effect of catalase suggested that, in this instance, H(2)O(2) was generated by the organisms. The antibacterial effect was largely prevented by preheating the myeloperoxidase at 80 C or greater for 10 min or by the addition of a number of inhibitors; it was most active at the most acid pH employed (5.0). Lactoperoxidase was considerably less effective than was myeloperoxidase when chloride was the halide employed. Myeloperoxidase, at high concentrations, exerted an antibacterial effect on L. acidophilus in the absence of added halide, which also was temperature- and catalase-sensitive. Peroxidase was extracted from intact guinea pig leukocytes by weak acid, and the extract with peroxidase activity had antibacterial properties which were similar, in many respects, to those of the purified preparation of myeloperoxidase. Under appropriate conditions, the antibacterial effect was increased by halides and by H(2)O(2) and was decreased by catalase, as well as by cyanide, azide, Tapazole, and thiosulfate. This suggests that, under the conditions employed, the antibacterial properties of a weak acid extract of guinea pig leukocytes is due, in part, to its peroxidase content, particularly if a halide is present in the reaction mixture. A heat-stable antibacterial agent or agents also appear to be present in the extract.

TI  - Iodination of bacteria: a bactericidal mechanism.
AB  - Myeloperoxidase, iodide, and H(2)O(2) have a bactericidal effect on Escherichia coli. Myeloperoxidase can be replaced in this system by lactoperoxidase or by a guinea pig leukocyte particulate preparation, H(2)O(2) by an H(2)O(2)-generating system such as glucose and glucose oxidase, and iodide by thyroxine or triiodothyronine. The bactericidal effect was high at pH 5.0 and fell as the pH was increased. Preincubation of myeloperoxidase, iodide, and H(2)O(2) for 30 min before the addition of the bacteria largely prevented the bactericidal effect. Thus, the organisms must be present in the reaction mixture during iodide oxidation for maximum killing, which suggests the involvement of labile intermediates of iodide oxidation rather than the more stable end products of oxidation such as iodine. Iodination of the bacteria by the myeloperoxidase-iodide-H(2)O(2) system was demonstrated chemically and radioautographically. Iodination and the bactericidal effect were similarly affected by changes in experimental conditions in all the parameters tested (effect of preincubation, pH, and inhibitors). Phagocytosis of bacteria by guinea pig leukocytes was associated with the conversion of iodide to a trichloroacetic acid-precipitable form. Iodide was localized radioautographically in the cytoplasm of human leukocytes which contained ingested bacteria. Iodide fixation was not observed in the absence of phagocytosis or in the presence of Tapazole.

AB  - Cells of the gram-positive organism Lactobacillus acidophilus R-26 were labeled with (3)H-thymine to measure the segregation of radioactive deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) into daugher cells. Such cells were found to contain 8 conserved units of DNA which would correspond to two replicating chromosomes per cell. Fluorescent antibody (FA) against this organism was used to demonstrate that portions of the cell surface (2 to 4 units per cell) were conserved during growth and division. The permanent association of DNA with these conserved cell surface units was measured by combining autoradiography with FA techniques. DNA synthesized immediately before FA labeling was not associated with the fluorescent cell surface, whereas DNA synthesized a generation previously was. The results are consistent with a model in which DNA becomes permanently fixed to the cell surface when it is first used as a template.

AB  - Clem, W. H. (University of Washington, Seattle), and S. J. Klebanoff. Inhibitory  effect of saliva on glutamic acid accumulation by Lactobacillus acidophilus and the role of the lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate system. J. Bacteriol. 91:1848-1853. 1966.-Saliva contains an antimicrobial system which inhibits the growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus, as well as a number of other organisms, in complete growth medium. This antimicrobial system consists of the salivary peroxidase (lactoperoxidase) and thiocyanate ions, and requires the presence of H(2)O(2). Saliva inhibits the accumulation of glutamic acid and certain other amino acids by resting cells. This effect of saliva is decreased by dialysis, and thiocyanate ions restore the inhibitory effect of dialyzed saliva. The inhibitory effect of saliva is decreased by heat (100 C, 10 min), and lactoperoxidase restores the inhibitory effect of heated saliva. Thus, the inhibition of glutamic acid accumulation by saliva appears to be due in part to the lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate antimicrobial system. H(2)O(2) increases the inhibitory effect of both saliva and the lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate system on glutamic acid accumulation. The inhibition of glutamic acid accumulation is not preceded by a loss in microbial viability. The glutamic acid accumulated by L. acidophilus under the conditions employed remains largely (over 90%) as free glutamic acid. This suggests that saliva and the lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-H(2)O(2) system inhibit the net transport of glutamic acid into the cell.

AB  - Soska, Jiri (Kansas State University, Manhattan). Growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus in the absence of folic acid. J. Bacteriol. 91:1840-1847. 1966.-A chemically defined medium, containing no folic acid, was used for the cultivation of Lactobacillus acidophilus R-26. In such a medium, the organism required thymine in addition to a deoxyriboside, purines, pyrimidines, and most amino acids. If thymine was present in this medium, an unlimited exponential growth was possible. The influence of the components of this medium on the growth is described. The concentration and type of adenine compounds in this medium were most important. Adenine and adenosine inhibited utilization of thymine, but not of thymidine, whereas adenylic acid inhibited recovery from amino acid starvation. In the absence of thymine or deoxyribosides, cells continued to grow in length, and after 3 hr a slow decline in viable count ensued.

Bacteriol. 90:541-545. 1965.-Mixed inocula of Vibrio comma KC-4 and various lactic acid-forming bacteria were injected into the intestinal segments of rabbits (De and Chatterje, 1953) to observe the effects of the latter agents in altering the changes produced by strain KC-4. The animals were sacrificed 10 and 20 hr after inoculation. The inoculated intestinal segments were first examined grossly, and the amount of exudate in the segments, if any, was measured, after which the tissues were subjected to pathological examination. When KC-4 cells together with spore-bearing lactic acid-forming bacilli, strain P-22, or Lactobacillus casei were introduced, the intestinal segments showed few or no macroscopic and microscopic changes, and no accumulation of exudate. With mixed inoculation with lactic acid bacteria such as L. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, Streptococcus lactis, and S. faecalis, changes were produced by strain KC-4. Macroscopically, no difference was discernible between the changes caused by mixed inoculation and those produced by single inoculation of KC-4. Upon pathological examination, however, it was seen that changes resulting from mixed inoculation were slightly less severe than those produced by inoculation with strain KC-4 only.

Bacteriol. 85:1295-1299. 1963.-A new group of 16 synthetic nitrogen-containing steroids have been tested against a variety of microorganisms for antimicrobial properties. The gradient plate screening method, serial dilution, and dry weight techniques were used in the studies. The organisms tested consisted of 14 gram-negative bacteria, 10 gram-positive bacteria, 2 actinomycetes, 7 yeasts, and 8 molds. Inhibitory properties were found to be specific and potent in four compounds, with inhibitory concentrations as low as 0.37 mug/ml. Three of the active steroids are 4-aza cholestanes and one is a 4-nor-3,5-secocholestane amide. Sensitivity to the compounds was greatest in the gram-positive bacteria, followed by the yeasts and molds. The gram-negative bacteria were not inhibited. All 16 steroids interfered to some extent with pigmentation in Serratia marcescens but not with pigment production in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In a few instances, some of the molds were stimulated by the steroids at a concentration of 250 mug/ml.

AB  - The stimulation by yeast extract of acid production in milk by various lactobacilli was studied. It was found that supplementing milk with purine and pyrimidine bases and amino acids allowed nearly maximal acid production by Lactobacillus bulgaricus strain 7994, L. acidophilus 4796, 4356, and 4357, and L. leichmannii 326 and 327. Further supplementation with deoxyribotides allowed maximal acid production by L. acidophilus 204, but L. acidophilus 207 required adenosine or adenylic acid. L. casei strain 7469 showed no appreciable response to the amino acids or purine and pyrimidine bases, and is presumed to require an unidentified factor in corn steep liquor.

Bacteriol. 82:623-631. 1961.-The utilization of pyrimidine deoxynucleosides was investigated by means of deoxyribosides of unnatural pyrimidines, especially by halogen-substituted uracil derivatives. All investigated deoxyribosides could be used, except that of N-methylthymidine. It was concluded that this substance cannot be a substrate for the enzyme trans-N-deoxyribosylase, which has been shown to be active in the utilization of deoxyribosides in this microorganism. With uracil as the only pyrimidine source, the halogen-substituted deoxyuridines had a certain inhibitory effect on growth. Contrary to previous findings, it was observed that normal growth occurs in the presence of thymine as the only pyrimidine source. The utilization of this substance is less efficient than that of uracil; a 1:10 dilution leads to a decrease in the extent of growth with the former, but not with the latter. From these results, complemented with experiments in which halogen-substituted uracil derivatives and the corresponding ribosides or deoxyribosides were used as inhibitors, it has been possible to account for most of the metabolic interconversions of pyrimidines in the investigated microorganism.

There is a time lag between restoration and the first synchronous division; during this time the amount of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) per cell increases in stepwise fashion, and tnass per cell increases linearly with time. The onset of cell division is heralded by cessation of DNA synthesis and an abrupt increase in rate of mass synthesis.
