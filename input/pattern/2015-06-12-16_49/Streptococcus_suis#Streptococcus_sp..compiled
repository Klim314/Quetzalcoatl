TI  - Antimicrobial Resistance Profile and Genotypic Characteristics of Streptococcus suis Capsular Type 2 Isolated from Clinical Carrier Sows and Diseased Pigs in China.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is an important zoonotic pathogen. Antimicrobial resistance phenotypes and genotypic characterizations of S. suis 2 from carrier sows and diseased pigs remain largely unknown. In this study, 96 swine S. suis type 2, 62 from healthy sows and 34 from diseased pigs, were analyzed. High frequency of tetracycline resistance was observed, followed by sulfonamides. The lowest resistance of S. suis 2 for beta-lactams supports their use as the primary antibiotics to treat the infection of serotype 2. In contrast, 35 of 37 S. suis 2 with MLSB phenotypes were isolated from healthy sows, mostly encoded by the ermB and/or the mefA genes. Significantly lower frequency of mrp+/epf+/sly+ was observed among serotype 2 from healthy sows compared to those from diseased pigs. Furthermore, isolates from diseased pigs showed more homogeneously genetic patterns, with most of them clustered in pulsotypes A and E. The data indicate the genetic complexity of S. suis 2 between herds and a close linkage among isolates from healthy sows and diseased pigs. Moreover, many factors, such as extensive use of tetracycline or diffusion of Tn916 with tetM, might have favored for the pathogenicity and widespread dissemination of S. suis serotype 2.
TI  - FATAL CASE OF STREPTOCOCCUS SUIS INFECTION IN A YOUNG WILD BOAR (SUS SCROFA) FROM SOUTHWESTERN SPAIN.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is a recognized pathogen that may cause important diseases in  pigs and humans. This microorganism has been repeatedly isolated from wild boar ( Sus scrofa ). However, its health implications for this wild species are still unknown. This article reports a detailed description of a fatal case of septicemia by S. suis affecting a young wild boar. The affected animal, about 15 days old, was found near death and exhibiting neurologic signs at a wild boar estate in southwestern Spain. Postmortem examination showed generalized congestion, brain hemorrhages and lobular pneumonia. Histopathological evaluation demonstrated the presence of meningitis and encephalitis with marked congestion and suppurative bronchopneumonia. Streptococcus suis serotype 2 isolates exhibiting important virulence factors (extracellular factor, muramidase-released protein, and suylisin) were isolated from the affected animal. This study confirms the presence of potentially virulent and zoonotic strains of S. suis in wild boar from Spain.
TI  - DISPOSITION OF CEFTIOFUR AND ITS ACTIVE METABOLITES IN FALLOW DEER (DAMA DAMA) FOLLOWING SINGLE-DOSE INTRAVENOUS AND INTRAMUSCULAR ADMINISTRATION.
AB  - Septicemia and foot infections associated with Fusobacterium necrophorum , Pasturella multocida, and Streptococcus suis in captive fallow deer ( Dama dama ) are reasonably treated with ceftiofur hydrochloride. This study describes the disposition of ceftiofur after single-dose intravenous and intramuscular administration of 3.65 +/- 0.1678 mg/kg in six female adult fallow deer using a nonrandomized crossover design and a 7-day washout period. Serial blood samples were collected for 12 hr postdrug administration. Ceftiofur bioactivity, including its active metabolite desfuroylceftiofur, was quantitated in serum using a microbiologic assay. After i.v. administration, the extrapolated serum drug concentration reported as median (range) was 52.83 (43.32-57.49) mug/ml and elimination half-life was 178.36 (19.75-217.22) min. The volume of distribution at steady-state was 0.171 (0.101-0.229) L/kg and serum clearance was 0.97 (0.48-4.3) ml/min per kg. After i.m. administration, median peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was 14.37 (9.00-32.00) mug/ml at 54.5 (11.00-95.00) min. The median elimination half-life and mean residence time were 128.32 (38.03-242.40) and 203.65 (62.48-347.15) min, respectively. The median absorption time after i.m. administration was 14.77 (-57.74 to 94.79) min. Bioavailability of ceftiofur following i.m. administration was 78.00 (58.00-137.00) percent. Based on this study, a mean i.m. dose of ceftiofur of 3.65 +/- 0.1678 mg/kg every 12 hr is recommended for maintaining serum concentrations above MIC90 levels for infections associated with F. necrophorum , P. multocida , and S. suis , in addition to other susceptible infectious bacteria.
TI  - TREM-1 signaling promotes host defense during the early stage of infection with the highly pathogenic Streptococcus suis.
AB  - The highly pathogenic Streptococcus suis (S. suis) infection can cause septic shock, and the disease is characterized by a high level of inflammatory cytokines and high mortality. Our previous study indicated that TREM-1 (triggering receptor expressed onmyeloid cells 1) was up-regulated in swine spleen cells in response to S. suis infection. The role of TREM-1 signaling in enhancing the pro-inflammatory response promoted us to examine its effect on the outcome of S. suis infection. In the present study, the recombinant extracellular domain of TREM-1 (rTREM-1) and an agonistic TREM-1 antibody was used to inhibit and activate TREM-1 signaling to evaluate its role in neutrophil activation, pathogen clearance, pro-inflammatory cytokine response and the outcome of the highly pathogenic S. suis infection in a mouse model. Blocking TREM-1 signaling could cause a more severe pro-inflammatory response and increase mortality in response to S. suis infection, while its activation could exert the opposite effect. The blocking or activation of TREM-1 signaling could inhibit or improve the number of neutrophils in the blood, which correlated well with the host clearance of S. suis.In conclusion, the TREM-1-mediated innate immune response played an essential role in the activation of neutrophils and S. suis clearance, which further reduced severe inflammation and finally benefited the outcome of the infection.
TI  - Development of loop-mediated isothermal amplification to detect Streptococcus suis and its application to retail pork meat in Japan.
AB  - We here developed a novel loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method to detect Streptococcus suis in raw pork meat. This method, designated LAMPSS, targeted the recombination/repair protein (recN) gene of S. suis and detected all serotypes of S. suis, except those taxonomically removed from authentic S. suis, i.e., serotypes 20, 22, 26, 32, 33, and 34. The specificity of LAMPSS was confirmed and its detection limit was 5.4cfu/reaction. Among the 966 raw pork meat samples examined, including sliced pork, minced pork, and the liver, tongue, heart, and small intestine, 255 samples tested positive with LAMPSS. The rate of contamination was higher in the organs than in pork. No significant difference was observed in the total bacterial count between LAMPSS-positive and -negative samples. The number of shops that provided LAMPSS-positive pork was slightly higher in those that sold swine organs and pork than in those that sold only pork, suggesting that cross contamination occurred from the organs to pork. Among the 255 which tested positive for LAMPSS, only 47 samples tested positive for the previously described LAMP specific for S. suis serotype 2. Two isolates of S. suis serotype 2, belonging to sequence type 28, which is potentially hazardous to humans, as well as those of some other serotypes were obtained from 19 out of 47 samples by combining LAMP with a replica plating method. These results suggest that LAMPSS will be a useful tool for the surveillance of raw pork meat in the retail market.
TI  - Streptococcus suis, an important pig pathogen and emerging zoonotic agent-an update on the worldwide distribution based on serotyping and sequence typing.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important pathogen causing economic problems in the pig  industry. Moreover, it is a zoonotic agent causing severe infections to people in close contact with infected pigs or pork-derived products. Although considered sporadic in the past, human S. suis infections have been reported during the last 45 years, with two large outbreaks recorded in China. In fact, the number of reported human cases has significantly increased in recent years. In this review, we present the worldwide distribution of serotypes and sequence types (STs), as determined by multilocus sequence typing, for pigs (between 2002 and 2013) and humans (between 1968 and 2013). The methods employed for S. suis identification and typing, the current epidemiological knowledge regarding serotypes and STs and the zoonotic potential of S. suis are discussed. Increased awareness of S. suis in both human and veterinary diagnostic laboratories and further establishment of typing methods will contribute to our knowledge of this pathogen, especially in regions where complete and/or recent data is lacking. More research is required to understand differences in virulence that occur among S. suis strains and if these differences can be associated with specific serotypes or STs.
TI  - Structural Basis for the Inhibition of Helicobacter pylori alpha-Carbonic Anhydrase by Sulfonamides.
AB  - Periplasmic alpha-carbonic anhydrase of Helicobacter pylori (HpalphaCA), an oncogenic bacterium in the human stomach, is essential for its acclimation to low pH. It catalyses the conversion of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate using Zn(II) as the cofactor. In H. pylori, Neisseria spp., Brucella suis and Streptococcus pneumoniae this enzyme is the target for sulfonamide antibacterial agents. We present structural analysis correlated with inhibition data, on the complexes of HpalphaCA with two pharmacological inhibitors of human carbonic anhydrases, acetazolamide and methazolamide. This analysis reveals that two sulfonamide oxygen atoms of the inhibitors are positioned proximal to the putative location of the oxygens of the CO2 substrate in the Michaelis complex, whilst the zinc-coordinating sulfonamide nitrogen occupies the position of the catalytic water molecule. The structures are consistent with acetazolamide acting as site-directed, nanomolar inhibitors of the enzyme by mimicking its reaction transition state. Additionally, inhibitor binding provides insights into the channel for substrate entry and product exit. This analysis has implications for the structure-based design of inhibitors of bacterial carbonic anhydrases.
TI  - Northern Ireland disease surveillance report, January to March 2015.

TI  - Temporal and spatial association of Streptococcus suis infection in humans and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome outbreaks in pigs in northern Vietnam.
AB  - Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) outbreaks in pigs are associated with increased susceptibility of pigs to secondary bacterial infections, including Streptococcus suis - an important zoonotic pathogen causing bacterial meningitis in humans. This case-control study examined the association between human S. suis infection and PRRS outbreaks in pigs in northern Vietnam. We included 90 S. suis case-patients and 183 non-S. suis sepsis controls from a referral hospital in Hanoi in 2010, a period of major PRRS epizootics in Vietnam. PRRS exposure was determined using data from the National Centre of Veterinary Diagnosis. By univariate analysis, significantly more S. suis patients were reported residing in or adjacent to a PRRS district compared to controls [odds ratio (OR) 2.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.35-5.89 and OR 3.15, 95% CI 1.62-6.15, respectively]. Only residency in adjacent districts remained significantly associated with risk of S. suis infection after adjusting for sex, occupation, and eating practices. SaTScan analysis showed a possible cluster of S. suis infection in humans around PRRS confirmed locations during the March-August period. The findings indicate an epidemiological association between PRRS in pigs and S. suis infections in humans. Effective strategies to strengthen control of PRRS in pigs may help reduce transmission of S. suis infection to humans.
TI  - Cultural drivers and health-seeking behaviours that impact on the transmission of pig-associated zoonoses in Lao People's Democratic Republic.
AB  - Pig rearing is an important income source in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR), with many smallholder farmers using traditional free-range pig production systems. Despite the potentially significant health risks posed by pig production regarding pig-associated zoonoses, information on the sociocultural drivers of these zoonoses is significantly lacking. This review summarises the existing sociocultural knowledge on eight pig-associated zoonoses suspected to be endemic in Southeast Asia: brucellosis, Q fever (Coxiella burnetii), trichinellosis, hepatitis E virus, leptospirosis, Japanese encephalitis, Streptococcus suis and Taenia solium taeniasis-cysticercosis. It summarises current knowledge on these diseases grouped according to their clinical manifestations in humans to highlight the propensity for underreporting. A literature search was conducted across multiple databases for publications from 1990 to the present day related to the eight pig-associated zoonoses and the risk and impact connected with them, with Lao PDR as a case study. Many of these pig-associated zoonoses have similar presentations and are often diagnosed as clinical syndromes. Misdiagnosis and underreporting are, therefore, substantial and emphasise the need for more robust diagnostics and appropriate surveillance systems. While some reports exist in other countries in the region, information is significantly lacking in Lao PDR with existing information coming mainly from the capital, Vientiane. The disease burden imposed by these zoonoses is not only characterised by morbidity and mortality, but directly impacts on livelihoods through income reduction and production losses, and indirectly through treatment costs and lost work opportunities. Other factors crucial to understanding and controlling these diseases are the influence of ethnicity and culture on food-consumption practices, pig rearing and slaughter practices, hygiene and sanitation, health-seeking behaviours and, therefore, risk factors for disease transmission. Published information on the knowledge, attitudes and beliefs of people regarding pig zoonoses and their risk factors is also extremely limited in Lao PDR and the broader Southeast Asian region. The need for more transdisciplinary research, using a One Health approach, in order to understand the underlining social determinants of health and their impacts on health-seeking behaviours, disease transmission and, ultimately, disease reporting, cannot be more emphasized.
TI  - Erratum: Genomic signatures of human and animal disease in the zoonotic pathogen  Streptococcus suis.
AB  
TI  - Recombination between Streptococcus suis ICESsu32457 and Streptococcus agalactiae ICESa2603 yields a hybrid ICE transferable to Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Integrative conjugative elements (ICEs) are mobile genetic elements that reside in the chromosome but retain the ability to undergo excision and to transfer by conjugation. Genes involved in drug resistance, virulence, or niche adaptation are often found among backbone genes as cargo DNA. We recently characterized in Streptococcus suis an ICE (ICESsu32457) carrying resistance genes [tet(O/W/32/O), tet(40), erm(B), aphA, and aadE] in the 15K unstable genetic element, which is flanked by two approximately 1.3kb direct repeats. Remarkably, approximately 1.3-kb sequences are conserved in ICESa2603 of Streptococcus agalactiae 2603V/R, which carry heavy metal resistance genes cadC/cadA and mer. In matings between S. suis 32457 (donor) and S. agalactiae 2603V/R (recipient), transconjugants were obtained. PCR experiments, PFGE, and sequence analysis of transconjugants demonstrated a tandem array between ICESsu32457 and ICESa2603. Matings between tandem array-containing S. agalactiae 2603V/R (donor) and Streptococcus pyogenes RF12 (recipient) yielded a single transconjugant containing a hybrid ICE, here named ICESa2603/ICESsu32457. The hybrid formed by recombination of the left approximately 1.3-kb sequence of ICESsu32457 and the approximately 1.3-kb sequence of ICESa2603. Interestingly, the hybrid ICE was transferable between S. pyogenes strains, thus demonstrating that it behaves as a conventional ICE. These findings suggest that both tandem arrays and hybrid ICEs may contribute to the evolution of antibiotic resistance in streptococci, creating novel mobile elements capable of disseminating new combinations of antibiotic resistance genes.
TI  - The immunoglobulin M-degrading enzyme of Streptococcus suis, Ide Ssuis , is involved in complement evasion.
AB  - Streptococcus (S.) suis is one of the most important pathogens in pigs causing meningitis, arthritis, endocarditis and serositis. Furthermore, it is also an emerging zoonotic agent. In our previous work we identified a highly specific IgM protease in S. suis, designated Ide Ssuis . The objective of this study was to characterize the function of Ide Ssuis in the host-pathogen interaction. Edman-sequencing revealed that Ide Ssuis cleaves the heavy chain of the IgM molecule between constant domain 2 and 3. As the C1q binding motif is located in the C3 domain, we hypothesized that Ide Ssuis is involved in complement evasion. Complement-mediated hemolysis induced by porcine hyperimmune sera containing erythrocyte-specific IgM was abrogated by treatment of these sera with recombinant Ide Ssuis . Furthermore, expression of Ide Ssuis reduced IgM-triggered complement deposition on the bacterial surface. An infection experiment of prime-vaccinated growing piglets suggested attenuation in the virulence of the mutant 10Deltaide Ssuis . Bactericidal assays confirmed a positive effect of Ide Ssuis expression on bacterial survival in porcine blood in the presence of high titers of specific IgM. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that Ide Ssuis is a novel complement evasion factor, which is important for bacterial survival in porcine blood during the early adaptive (IgM-dominated) immune response.

TI  - Dynamic viral-bacterial interactions in a porcine precision-cut lung slice co-infection model: swine influenza virus paves the way for Streptococcus suis infection in a two-step process.
AB  - Swine influenza virus (SIV) and Streptococcus suis are common pathogens of the respiratory tract in pigs, both associated with pneumonia. The interactions of both pathogens and their contribution to co-pathogenesis are only poorly understood. In the present study we established a porcine precision-cut lung slice co-infection model and analyzed the effects of a primary SIV infection on secondary infection by S. suis at different time points. We found that SIV promoted adherence, colonization, and invasion of S. suis in a two-step process. Firstly, in the initial stages, these effects were dependent on bacterial encapsulation, as shown by selective adherence of encapsulated, but not unencapsulated S. suis to SIV-infected cells. Secondly, at a later stage of infection SIV promoted S. suis adherence and invasion of deeper tissues by damaging ciliated epithelial cells. This effect was only seen with a highly virulent SIV subtype H3N2 strain, but not with a low virulent subtype H1N1 strain, and it was independent of the bacterial capsule, since an unencapsulated S. suis mutant behaved in a similar way as the encapsulated wild-type strain. Concluding, the porcine precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) co-infection model established here revealed novel insights into the dynamic interactions between SIV and S. suis during infection of the respiratory tract. It showed that at least two different mechanisms contribute to the beneficial effects of SIV for S. suis, including capsule-mediated bacterial attachment to SIV-infected cells and capsule-independent effects involving virus-mediated damage of ciliated epithelial cells.
TI  - Investigation of Pathogenesis of H1N1 Influenza Virus and Swine Streptococcus suis Serotype 2 Co-Infection in Pigs by Microarray Analysis.
AB  - Swine influenza virus and Streptococcus suis are two important contributors to the porcine respiratory disease complex, and both have significant economic impacts. Clinically, influenza virus and Streptococcus suis co-infections in pigs are very common, which often contribute to severe pneumonia and can increase the mortality. However, the co-infection pathogenesis in pigs is unclear. In the present study, co-infection experiments were performed using swine H1N1 influenza virus and Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2). The H1N1-SS2 co-infected pigs exhibited more severe clinical symptoms, serious pathological changes, and robust apoptosis of lungs at 6 days post-infection compared with separate H1N1 and SS2 infections. A comprehensive gene expression profiling using a microarray approach was performed to investigate the global host responses of swine lungs against the swine H1N1 infection, SS2 infection, co-infection, and phosphate-buffered saline control. Results showed 457, 411, and 844 differentially expressed genes in the H1N1, SS2, and H1N1-SS2 groups, respectively, compared with the control. Noticeably, genes associated with the immune, inflammatory, and apoptosis responses were highly overexpressed in the co-infected group. Pathway analysis indicated that the cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, MAPK, toll-like receptor, complement and coagulation cascades, antigen processing and presentation, and apoptosis pathway were significantly regulated in the co-infected group. However, the genes related to these were less regulated in the separate H1N1 and SS2 infection groups. This observation suggested that a certain level of synergy was induced by H1N1 and SS2 co-infection with significantly stronger inflammatory and apoptosis responses, which may lead to more serious respiratory disease syndrome and pulmonary pathological lesion.
TI  - Molecular Basis of Resistance to Selected Antimicrobial Agents in the Emerging Zoonotic Pathogen Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Characterization of 227 Streptococcus suis isolated from pigs during 2010 - 2013  showed high level resistance to clindamycin (95.6%), tilmicosin (94.7%), tylosin (93.8%), oxytetracycline (89.4%), chlortetracycline (86.8%), tiamulin (72.7%), neomycin (70.0%), enrofloxacin (56.4%), penicillin (56.4%), ceftiofur (55.9%), and gentamicin (55.1%). Resistance to tetracyclines, macrolides, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolone was attributed to tet gene, erm(B), erm(C), mph(C), and mef(A/E) genes, aph(3')-IIIa and aac(6')Ie-aph(2")-Ia genes, and single point mutations in the quinolone-resistance determining region of ParC and GyrA, respectively.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a native avirulent strain of Streptococcus suis serotype 2: a perspective for vaccine development.
AB  - Streptococcus suis, an emerging infectious pathogen, is the cause of two large-scale outbreaks of human streptococcal toxic shock syndrome in China, and has attracted much attention from the scientific community. The genetic basis of its pathogenesis remains enigmatic, and no effective prevention measures have been established. To better understand the virulence differentiation of S. suis and develop a promising vaccine, we isolated and sequenced a native avirulent S. suis strain (05HAS68). Animal experiments revealed that 05HAS68 is an avirulent strain and could protect piglets from the attack of virulent strains. Comparative genomics analyses demonstrated the genetic basis for the lack of virulence in 05HAS68, which is characterized by the absence of some important virulence-associated factors and the intact 89K pathogenicity island. Lack of virulence was also illustrated by reduced survival of 05HAS68 compared to a virulent strain in pig whole blood. Further investigations revealed a large-scale genomic rearrangement in 05HAS68, which was proposed to be mediated by transposase genes and/or prophages. This genomic rearrangement may have caused the genomic diversity of S. suis, and resulted in biological discrepancies between 05HAS68 and highly virulent S. suis strains.
TI  - Candidate proteomic biomarkers for three genogroups of the swine pathogen Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus suis, more specifically serotype 2, is a major swine pathogen and an emerging zoonotic agent that causes severe infections such as meningitis, endocarditis, and septicemia. In this study, surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI) was used to investigate the protein expression profiles of 45 strains of S. suis serotype 2 that had previously been clustered by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) into three sequence types (ST1, ST25, and ST28) (n = 15 for each ST). RESULTS: The SELDI data were analyzed using the univariate Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests and multivariate statistical methods (heatmap/hierarchical clustering). The heatmap identified 136 cell proteins, and hierarchical clustering provided a 100% correct classification of all fifteen ST1 and ST25 strains and thirteen of the fifteen ST28 strains (87% correct). The univariate statistical analyses of the SELDI protein expression profiles identified nine significant proteins that discriminated the strains of the three STs of S. suis. Of these proteins, two were overexpressed in ST1 (5958 Da and 10249 Da), four in ST25 (5989 Da, 6646 Da, 7421 Da, and 9825 Da), and three in ST28 (4516 Da, 7833 Da, and 9342 Da). Two of the proteins associated with the ST28 strains (p4516 and p9342) were purified and were identified as a putative ABC transporter and a nucleoid-DNA-binding protein, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: SELDI analysis of 45 strains of S. suis allowed to identify nine statistically significant proteins that can be specifically correlated with either ST1, ST25 or ST28. The possible involvement of the overexpressed proteins in the pathology of S. suis infections will require further investigation.
TI  - Multilocus sequence typing of Australian Streptococcus suis type 2 by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis of PCR amplicons.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is a ubiquitous pathogen of swine and is known to cause severe disease in humans. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) is ideal for characterising this organism because it permits isolates to be compared on a national and international scale. A novel approach to MLST using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry (MS-MLST) provides a more rapid alternative to dideoxy sequencing. This study used MS-MLST to define the multilocus sequence types (STs) present among a collection of Australian S. suis type 2, and thus, delivered a basis for comparison of Australian isolates with international strains already well characterised for virulence attributes. A collection of 45 isolates recovered from infected humans (n=3) and diseased pigs (n=42) was genotyped using MS-MLST and conventional MLST. Both methods were 100% concordant in their classification of sequence types (STs), although MS-MLST permitted much quicker analysis of sequence data. The collection contained ST25 (n=31), ST1 (n=10), ST28 (n=3) and ST369 (n=1). These results are consistent with the population structure of S. suis type 2 observed in diseased pigs and humans in Canada and the United Kingdom. MS-MLST may have utility for studying the population structure and epidemiology of S. suis in countries where the diversity of S. suis is greater and human disease is more common.
TI  - Eight Novel Capsular Polysaccharide Synthesis Gene Loci Identified in Nontypeable Streptococcus suis Isolates.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important pathogen of pigs and may cause serious disease in humans. Serotyping is one of the important diagnostic tools and is used for the epidemiological study of S. suis. Nontypeable S. suis strains have been reported in many studies; however, the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) synthesis cps loci of nontypeable strains have not been analyzed. In this study, we investigated the genetic characteristics of cps loci in 78 nontypeable strains isolated from healthy pigs. Eight novel cps loci (NCLs) were found, and all of them were located between the orfZ-orfX region and the glf gene. All NCLs possess the wzy and wzx genes, strongly suggesting that the CPSs of these NCLs were synthesized using the Wzx/Wzy-dependent pathway. The cps genes found in the 78 isolates were assigned to 96 homology groups (HGs), 55 of which were NCL specific. The encapsulation of the 78 isolates was also examined using transmission electron microscopy. Fifty-three isolates were found to have a capsule, and these were of varied thicknesses. Our data enhance our understanding of the cps gene cluster diversity of nontypeable S. suis strains and provide insight into the evolution of the S. suis capsular genes.
TI  - Role of the capsular polysaccharide as a virulence factor for Streptococcus suis  serotype 14.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important swine pathogen and a zoonotic agent causing meningitis and septicemia. Although serotype 2 is the most virulent type, serotype 14 is emerging, and understanding of its pathogenesis is limited. To study the role of the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) of serotype 14 as a virulence factor, we constructed knockout mutants devoid of either cps14B, a highly conserved regulatory gene, or neu14C, a gene coding for uridine diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase, which is involved in sialic acid synthesis. The mutants showed total loss of the CPS with coagglutination assays and electron microscopy. Phagocytosis assays showed high susceptibility of mutant Deltacps14B. An in vivo murine model was used to demonstrate attenuated virulence of this non-encapsulated mutant. Despite the difference in the CPS composition of different serotypes, this study has demonstrated for the first time that the CPS of a serotype other than 2 is also an important antiphagocytic factor and a critical virulence factor.
TI  - The immunoglobulin M-degrading enzyme of Streptococcus suis, IdeSsuis, is a highly protective antigen against serotype 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis (S. suis) is a major porcine pathogen causing meningitis, arthritis and several other pathologies. Recently, we identified a highly specific immunoglobulin M degrading enzyme of S. suis, designated IdeSsuis, which is expressed by various serotypes. The objective of this work was to access the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a recombinant vaccine including IdeSsuis. Vaccination with rIdeSsuis elicited antibodies efficiently neutralizing the IgM protease activity. Importantly, 18 piglets vaccinated with rIdeSsuis alone or in combination with bacterin priming were completely protected against mortality and severe morbidity after S. suis serotype 2 challenge. In contrast, 12 of the 17 piglets either treated with the placebo or primed with the bacterin only, succumbed to S. suis disease. Immunity against IdeSsuis was associated with increased killing of S. suis wt in porcine blood ex vivo leading to a tenfold difference in the bacterial survival factor in blood of placebo-treated and rIdeSsuis-vaccinated piglets. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that rIdeSsuis is a highly protective antigen in pigs.
TI  - Genomic signatures of human and animal disease in the zoonotic pathogen Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis causes disease in pigs worldwide and is increasingly implicated in zoonotic disease in East and South-East Asia. To understand the genetic basis of disease in S. suis, we study the genomes of 375 isolates with detailed clinical phenotypes from pigs and humans from the United Kingdom and Vietnam. Here, we show that isolates associated with disease contain substantially fewer genes than non-clinical isolates, but are more likely to encode virulence factors. Human disease isolates are limited to a single-virulent population, originating in the 1920, s when pig production was intensified, but no consistent genomic differences between pig and human isolates are observed. There is little geographical clustering of different S. suis subpopulations, and the bacterium undergoes high rates of recombination, implying that an increase in virulence anywhere in the world could have a global impact over a short timescale.
TI  - Evaluation of the protective efficacy of four novel identified membrane associated proteins of Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S. suis 2) is an important zoonotic pathogen that  can also cause epidemics of life-threatening infections in humans. Surface proteins of pathogens play a critical role in the interaction with host system or environment, as they take part in processes like virulence, cytotoxicity, adhesion, signaling or transport, etc. Thus, surface proteins identified by the screening of immunoproteomic techniques are promising vaccine candidates or diagnostic markers. In this study, four membrane associated proteins (MAP) identified by immunoproteomic method were cloned and expressed as recombinant proteins with his-tag. Screening for vaccine candidates were firstly performed by protection assay in vivo and immunization with Sbp markedly protected mice against systemic S. suis 2 infection. The immune responses and protective of Sbp were further evaluated. The results showed that Sbp could elicit a strong humoral antibody response and protect mice from lethal challenge with S. suis 2. The antiserum against Sbp could efficiently impede survival of bacterial in whole blood killing assay and conferred significant protection against S. suis 2 infection in passive immunization assays. The findings indicate that Sbp may serve as an important factor in the pathogenesis of S. suis 2 and would be a promising subunit vaccine candidate.
TI  - A novel pro-inflammatory protein of Streptococcus suis 2 induces the Toll-like receptor 2-dependent expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in RAW 264.7 macrophages via activation of ERK1/2 pathway.
AB  - Streptococcus suis 2 is an important swine pathogen and an emergent zoonotic pathogen. Excessive inflammation caused by S. suis is responsible for the high levels of early mortality observed in septic shock-like syndrome cases. However, the mechanisms through which S. suis 2 (SS2) causes excessive inflammation remain unclear. Thus, this study aimed to identify novel pro-inflammatory mediators that play important roles in the development of therapies against SS2 infection. In this study, the novel pro-inflammatory protein HP0459, which was encoded by the SSUSC84_0459 gene, was discovered. The stimulation of RAW 264.7 macrophages with recombinant HP0459 protein induced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, MCP-1 and TNF-alpha). Compared with the wild-type (WT) strain, the isogenic knockout of HP0459 in SS2 led to reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in RAW264.7 macrophages and in vivo. The pro-inflammatory activity of HP0459 was significantly reduced by an antibody against Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in RAW264.7 macrophages and was lower in TLR2-deficient (TLR2-/-) macrophages than in WT macrophages. Furthermore, specific inhibitors of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathways significantly decreased the HP0459-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and a western blot assay showed that HP0459 stimulation induced the activation of the ERK1/2 pathway. Taken together, our data indicate that HP0459 is a novel pro-inflammatory mediator of SS2 and induces TLR2-dependent pro-inflammatory activity in RAW264.7 macrophages through the ERK1/2 pathway.
TI  - Bacterial cell surface properties: role of loosely bound extracellular polymeric  substances (LB-EPS).
AB  - This study investigated the effect of loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances (LB-EPS) on the comprehensive surface properties of four bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus suis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida). The removal of LB-EPS from bacterial surfaces by high-speed centrifugation (12,000xg) was confirmed by SEM images. Viability tests showed that the percentages of viable cells ranged from 95.9% to 98.0%, and no significant difference was found after treatment (P>0.05). FTIR spectra revealed the presence of phosphodiester, carboxylic, phosphate, and amino functional groups on bacteria surfaces, and the removal of LB-EPS did not alter the types of cell surface functional groups. Potentiometric titration results suggested the total site concentrations on the intact bacteria were higher than those on LB-EPS free bacteria. Most of the acidity constants (pKa) were almost identical, except the increased pKa values of phosphodiester groups on LB-EPS free S. suis and E. coli surfaces. The electrophoretic mobilities and hydrodynamic diameters of the intact and LB-EPS free bacteria were statistically unchanged (P>0.05), indicating LB-EPS had no influence on the net surface charges and size distribution of bacteria. However, LB-ESP could enhance cell aggregation processes. The four LB-EPS free bacteria all exhibited fewer hydrophobicity values (26.1-65.0%) as compared to the intact cells (47.4-69.3%), suggesting the removal of uncharged nonpolar compounds (e.g., carbohydrates) in LB-EPS. These findings improve our understanding of the changes in cell surface characterizations induced by LB-EPS, and have important implications for assessing the role of LB-EPS in bacterial adhesion and transport behaviors.
TI  - Proteomics identification of novel fibrinogen-binding proteins of Streptococcus suis contributing to antiphagocytosis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) induced sepsis and meningitis are often accompanied by bacteremia. However, the mechanism whereby it helps S. suis to evade PMN-mediated phagocytosis remain unclear. Because of the central roles of bacteria-human fibrinogen (hFg) interaction in innate immunity, here, a proteomics based Far-western blotting (PBFWB) was developed to identify the fibrinogen-binding surface proteins of S. suis (SsFBPs) on a large-scale. And then thirteen potential SsFBPs were identified by PBFWB and we selected seven potential surface proteins to further confirm their binding ability to hFg, of which the gene mutant strains of MRP displayed significantly decrease in binding to immobilized hFg. Additionally, the polyclonal antibodies against Enolase were found to significantly inhibit the binding of SS2 to hFg. Strikingly, MRP and Enolase were found to improve the antiphagocytic ability of SS2 to PMNs by interacting with hFg and enhance the survival of SS2 in human blood. Taken together, the PBFWB method provides useful clues to the bacteria-host interactions. These studies firstly disclose MRP and Enolase were involved in immune evasion of SS2 at least in part by binding to Fg, which make them potential targets for therapies for SS2 infection.
TI  - Genetic diversity and virulence of novel sequence types of Streptococcus suis from diseased and healthy pigs in China.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is a serious threat to swine industry and public health. In this work, a total of 62 S. suis isolates recovered from infected and healthy pigs from four provinces in northern China were classified by multilocus sequence typing into nine sequence types (STs), including six novel ones, namely, ST417, ST418, ST419, ST420, ST421, and ST422. The majority (64.5%) of these 62 isolates belong to serotype 2; all of these serotype 2 isolates can be assigned into ST1 or ST28 clonal complex, indicating at least two parallel routes of clonal dissemination of these isolates. In these serotype 2 isolates, 23 (20 from healthy pigs and three from diseased pigs) were identified as ST7 strains, which were previously characterized as the cause of streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome. The novel ST strains lack 89 K pathogenicity island but can cause septicemia and meningitis in a mouse model, showing remarkable differences in virulence. The ST421 strain named HLB causes suppurative encephalitis. Our results highlighted the need for increased surveillance of S. suis in farm-raised pigs in northern China.
TI  - Potential probiotic attributes of a new strain of Bacillus coagulans CGMCC 9951 isolated from healthy piglet feces.
AB  - A new strain of Bacillus coagulans CGMCC 9551, which has a broad range of antibacterial activities against six main pathogenic bacteria including Escherichia coli O8, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar enteritidis, Streptococcus suis, Listeria monocytogenes and Pasteurella multocida, was isolated from healthy piglet feces. In adhesion assay, the isolate exhibited a stronger adhesion to pig intestinal mucus than that of B. subtilis JT143 and L. acidophilus LY24 respectively isolated from BioPlus((R))2B and FloraFIT((R)) Probiotics (P < 0.05). The adhesion activity reached 44.5 +/- 3.2, 48.9 +/- 2.6, 42.6 +/- 3.3 and 37.6 +/- 2.4 % to jejunum, ileum, transverse colon and sigmoid colon, separately. The survival rate of B. coagulans CGMCC 9551 was reduced by only 20 % at 4 h exposure under 0.9 % w/v bile salt. The strain was fully resistant to pH 2 for 2 h with 90.1 +/- 3.5 % survival and susceptible to 15 antibiotics commonly used in veterinary medicine. Additionally, the bacteria showed amylase, protease and cellulase activities. The safety assessment demonstrated the lack of toxicity potential in B. coagulans CGMCC 9551 by ligated rabbit ileal loop assay, acute and subchronic toxicity test. These results implied that that the new strain of B. coagulans CGMCC 9951 isolated from healthy piglet feces has promising probiotic characteristics and offers desirable opportunities for its successful commercialization as one excellent candidate probiotic.
TI  - Genome-wide identification of allele-specific expression in response to Streptococcus suis 2 infection in two differentially susceptible pig breeds.
AB  - Although allele expression imbalance has been recognized in many species, and strongly linked to diseases, no whole transcriptome allele imbalance has been detected in pigs during pathogen infections. The pathogen Streptococcus suis 2 (SS2) causes serious zoonotic disease. Different pig breeds show differential susceptibility/resistance to pathogen infection, but the biological insight is little known. Here we analyzed allele-specific expression (ASE) using the spleen transcriptome of four pigs belonging to two phenotypically different breeds after SS2 infection. The comparative analysis of allele specific SNPs between control and infected animals revealed 882 and 1096 statistically significant differentially expressed allele SNPs (criteria: ratio>==2 or <==0.5) in Landrace and Enshi black pig, respectively. Twenty nine allelically imbalanced SNPs were further verified by Sanger sequencing, and later six SNPs were quantified by pyrosequencing assay. The pyrosequencing results are in agreement with the RNA-seq results, except two SNPs. Looking at the role of ASE in predisposition to diseases, the discovery of causative variants by ASE analysis might help the pig industry in long term to design breeding programs for improving SS2 resistance.
TI  - Superoxide dismutase of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 plays a role in anti-autophagic response by scavenging reactive oxygen species in infected macrophages.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) causes septic shock and meningitis. However,  its pathogenesis is still not well-understood. We have recently shown that superoxide dismutase sodA of SS2 is a virulence factor probably by increasing resistance to oxidative stresses. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are products of the respiratory burst of phagocytic cells and have been shown to activate autophagy. We wanted to know if and how SS2 explores its sodA to interfere with cell autophagic responses. A sodA deletion mutant (Deltasod) was compared with its parent and complemented strain in autophagic response in the murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7. We found that the Deltasod mutant induced significant autophagic responses in infected cells, shown as increased LC3 lipidation (LC3-II) and EGFP-LC3 punctae, than those infected by its parent or complemented strain at 1 or 2h post-infection. Co-localization of the autophagosomal EGFP-LC3 vesicles with lysosomes was seen in cells infected with Deltasod mutant and its parent strain, indicating that SS2 infection induced complete autophagic responses. Reduced autophagic responses of cells infected with the wild-type strain might be related to decreased ROS by the scavenging effect of its sodA, as shown by increased superoxide anion or ROS level in cells infected with the Deltasod mutant and in the cell free xanthine oxidase-hypoxanthine ROS-generating system, as compared with its parent or complemented strain. Taken together, SS2 makes use of its sodA for survival not only by scavenging ROS but also by alleviating the host autophagic responses due to ROS stimulation.
TI  - Impact of an experimental PRRSV and Streptococcus suis coinfection on the pharmacokinetics of ceftiofur hydrochloride after intramuscular injection in pigs.
AB  - This study determined the impact of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and Streptococcus suis coinfection on the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ceftiofur hydrochloride in pigs after intramuscular (i.m.) injection. Eighteen clinically normal crossbred gilts were assigned by weight into a challenge group (10 pigs) and control group (eight pigs). Pigs in both groups received a single i.m. injection of ceftiofur hydrochloride (Excenel RTU Sterile Suspension; Zoetis) at a 5 mg/kg BW dose. Serial blood samples were collected to characterize the plasma concentration curve. After a 10 days drug washout period, the challenge group was inoculated with 2 mL of PRRSV isolate VR-2385 (105.75 50% tissue culture infective doses per mL) intranasally and 8 days later inoculated S. suis. When clinical disease was evident, the second PK assessment began in both challenge and control groups. Coinfected pigs demonstrated lower values of AUC and CMAX , but higher values of Cl/F and Vz/F indicating drug kinetics were altered by infection. The data from this study have implications on ceftiofur treatment regimens in diseased pigs.
TI  - Exposure of feral swine (Sus scrofa) in the United States to selected pathogens.
AB  - Feral swine (Sus scrofa) are widely distributed in the United States. In 2011 and 2012, serum samples and tonsils were recovered from 162 and 37 feral swine, respectively, in the US to evaluate exposure to important swine endemic pathogens. Antibodies against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) were found in 2.5% and 25.3% of tested sera, respectively. Positive serological reactions against Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae have been detected in 19.7% and 69.7% of animals. More than 15% of animals presented antibodies against these 2 pathogens simultaneously. Most animals were also seropositive for Lawsonia intracellularis. Feral swine can also be involved in transmission of zoonotic agents. Almost 50% of animals possessed antibodies against Salmonella. In addition, 94.4% of animals were carriers of Streptococcus suis in their tonsils. In conclusion, feral swine may be considered as a potential reservoir for different endemic diseases in domestic pigs, as well as for important zoonotic agents.
TI  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 strains can induce the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps and evade trapping.
AB  - Streptococcus suis (S. suis) ranks among the five most important porcine pathogens worldwide and occasionally threatens human health, especially in people that come into close contact with pigs or pork products. Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is considered to be the most pathogenic and prevalent capsular type. As a first line of immune defense against SS2 infection, neutrophils can eliminate the invader not only by phagocytosis but also by neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)-mediated killing. SS2 can resist phagocytosis through polysaccharide capsule (CPS), but how this strain evades the effects of NETs remains to be determined. The present study demonstrated that the epidemic strain 05ZY, the highly pathogenic strain P1/7 and the intermediately pathogenic strain A7 could induce the formation of NETs. Furthermore, SS2 strains could successfully resist NETs-mediated killing, and the CPS structure contributed to this resistance by escaping the trapping. Therefore, the CPS structure not only contributed to the SS2 strains' resistance to phagocytosis-mediated killing but also played an essential role in evading NETs trapping and further killing in vitro. This study strengthens our understanding of how S. suis can evade innate immune surveillance and elimination.
TI  - Identification of a novel DNase of Streptococcus suis (EndAsuis) important for neutrophil extracellular trap degradation during exponential growth.
AB  - The porcine and human pathogen Streptococcus suis induces and degrades neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in vitro. In this study, we investigated the working hypothesis that NET degradation is mediated not only by the known secreted S. suis nuclease A (SsnA) but also by a so-far undescribed putative endonuclease A of S. suis (designated EndAsuis) homologous to the pneumococcal endonuclease A (EndA). Comparative analysis was conducted to identify differences in localization, expression and function of EndAsuis and SsnA. In contrast to ssnA, endAsuis RNA expression was not substantially different during exponential and stationary growth. Modelling of the 3D structure confirmed a putative DRGH-motif-containing betabetaalpha-metal finger catalytic core in EndAsuis. Accordingly, nuclease activity of recombinant EndAsuis with a point-mutated H165 was rescued through imidazol treatment. In accordance with a putative membrane anchor, nuclease activity caused by endAsuis was not detectable in the supernatant. Importantly, endAsuis determined nuclease activity of S. suis prominently during exponential growth. This activity depended on the presence of Mg(2+) but, in contrast to SsnA activity, not on Ca(2+). A pH of 5.4 did not inhibit endAsuis-encoded nuclease activity during exponential growth. NET degradation of S. suis harvested during exponential growth was significantly attenuated in the endAsuis mutant. In contrast to SsnA, mutagenesis of endAsuis did not result in a significantly higher susceptibility against the antimicrobial effect mediated by NETs. As degradation of bacterial DNA caused by S. suis depended on ssnA and endAsuis, further functions of both factors in the host-pathogen interaction might be envisioned.
TI  - Suicin 3908, a new lantibiotic produced by a strain of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 isolated from a healthy carrier pig.
AB  - While Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is known to cause severe infections in pigs,  it can also be isolated from the tonsils of healthy animals that do not develop infections. We hypothesized that S. suis strains in healthy carrier pigs may have the ability to produce bacteriocins, which may contribute to preventing infections by pathogenic S. suis strains. Two of ten S. suis serotype 2 strains isolated from healthy carrier pigs exhibited antibacterial activity against pathogenic S. suis isolates. The bacteriocin produced by S. suis 3908 was purified to homogeneity using a three-step procedure: ammonium sulfate precipitation, cationic exchange HPLC, and reversed-phase HPLC. The bacteriocin, called suicin 3908, had a low molecular mass; was resistant to heat, pH, and protease treatments; and possessed membrane permeabilization activity. Additive effects were obtained when suicin 3908 was used in combination with penicillin G or amoxicillin. The amino acid sequence of suicin 3908 suggested that it is lantibiotic-related and made it possible to identify a bacteriocin locus in the genome of S. suis D12. The putative gene cluster involved in suicin production by S. suis 3908 was amplified by PCR, and the sequence analysis revealed the presence of nine open reading frames (ORFs), including the structural gene and those required for the modification of amino acids, export, regulation, and immunity. Suicin 3908, which is encoded by the suiA gene, exhibited approximately 50% identity with bovicin HJ50 (Streptococcus bovis), thermophilin 1277 (Streptococcus thermophilus), and macedovicin (Streptococcus macedonicus). Given that S. suis 3908 cannot cause infections in animal models, that it is susceptible to conventional antibiotics, and that it produces a bacteriocin with antibacterial activity against all pathogenic S. suis strains tested, it could potentially be used to prevent infections and to reduce antibiotic use by the swine industry.
TI  - Streptococcus suis infection in hospitalized patients, Nakhon Phanom Province, Thailand.
AB  - In Nakhon Phanom, Thailand, we identified 38 hospitalized patients with Streptococcus suis infection during 2006-2012. Deafness developed in 12 patients; none died. Thirty-five reported recent exposure to pigs/pork. Annual incidence was 0.1-2.2 cases/100,000 population (0.2-3.2 in persons >/=20 years of age). Clinicians should consider S. suis infection in areas where pig exposure is common.
TI  - Development and application of loop-mediated isothermal amplification assays based on ITS-1 for rapid detection of Toxoplasma gondii in pork.
AB  - The loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay is a novel method that rapidly amplifies DNA with high specificity and sensitivity under isothermal conditions. In this study, we established a LAMP assay with six primers targeting a highly conserved region of Toxoplasma gondii ITS-1 sequence. The amplification protocol completes within 30 min under isothermal condition in a 65 degrees C water bath while specificity tests confirmed no cross-reactivity with DNA templates of Neospora caninum, Eimeria tenella, Cryptosporidium parvum, Listeria monocytogenes and Streptococcus suis. The detection limit of the LAMP assay was 0.9 fg T. gondii genomic DNA, a sensitivity that was 10-fold higher than that of a conventional PCR assay. Both LAMP assay and conventional PCR were applied to detect T. gondii genomic DNA in 118 diaphragm samples obtained from pig farms in Zhejiang Province, China. Our results showed that the LAMP assay is more sensitive than conventional PCR (13.56% and 9.32%). The LAMP assay established in this study provides a simple, specific, sensitive and rapid method of T. gondii genomic DNA detection, hence is expected to plays an important role in the monitoring of T. gondii contamination in various food products.
TI  - Transduction of the Streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage Phim46.1, carrying resistance genes mef(A) and tet(O), to other Streptococcus species.
AB  - Phim46.1 - Streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage carrying mef(A) and tet(O), respectively, encoding resistance to macrolides (M phenotype) and tetracycline - is widespread in S. pyogenes but has not been reported outside this species. Phim46.1 is transferable in vitro among S. pyogenes isolates, but no information is available about its transferability to other Streptococcus species. We thus investigated Phim46.1 for its ability to be transduced in vitro to recipients of different Streptococcus species. Transductants were obtained from recipients of Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus gordonii, and Streptococcus suis. Retransfer was always achieved, and from S. suis to S. pyogenes occurred at a much greater frequency than in the opposite direction. In transductants Phim46.1 retained its functional properties, such as inducibility with mitomycin C, presence both as a prophage and as a free circular form, and transferability. The transductants shared the same Phim46.1 chromosomal integration site as the donor, at the 3' end of a conserved RNA uracil methyltransferase (rum) gene, which is an integration hotspot for a variety of genetic elements. No transfer occurred to recipients of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus salivarius, even though rum-like genes were also detected in the sequenced genomes of these species. A largely overlapping 18-bp critical sequence, where the site-specific recombination process presumably takes place, was identified in the rum genes of all recipients, including those of the species yielding no transductants. Growth assays to evaluate the fitness cost of Phim46.1 acquisition disclosed a negligible impact on S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, and S. gordonii transductants and a noticeable fitness advantage in S. suis. The S. suis transductant also displayed marked overexpression of the autolysin-encoding gene atl.
TI  - Orientia, rickettsia, and leptospira pathogens as causes of CNS infections in Laos: a prospective study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Scrub typhus (caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi), murine typhus (caused by Rickettsia typhi), and leptospirosis are common causes of febrile illness in Asia; meningitis and meningoencephalitis are severe complications. However, scarce data exist for the burden of these pathogens in patients with CNS disease in endemic countries. Laos is representative of vast economically poor rural areas in Asia with little medical information to guide public health policy. We assessed whether these pathogens are important causes of CNS infections in Laos. METHODS: Between Jan 10, 2003, and Nov 25, 2011, we enrolled 1112 consecutive patients of all ages admitted with CNS symptoms or signs requiring a lumbar puncture at Mahosot Hospital, Vientiane, Laos. Microbiological examinations (culture, PCR, and serology) targeted so-called conventional bacterial infections (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, S suis) and O tsutsugamushi, Rickettsia typhi/Rickettsia spp, and Leptospira spp infections in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We analysed and compared causes and clinical and CSF characteristics between patient groups. FINDINGS: 1051 (95%) of 1112 patients who presented had CSF available for analysis, of whom 254 (24%) had a CNS infection attributable to a bacterial or fungal pathogen. 90 (35%) of these 254 infections were caused by O tsutsugamushi, R typhi/Rickettsia spp, or Leptospira spp. These pathogens were significantly more frequent than conventional bacterial infections (90/1051 [9%] vs 42/1051 [4%]; p<0.0001) by use of conservative diagnostic definitions. CNS infections had a high mortality (236/876 [27%]), with 18% (13/71) for R typhi/Rickettsia spp, O tsutsugamushi, and Leptospira spp combined, and 33% (13/39) for conventional bacterial infections (p=0.076). INTERPRETATION: Our data suggest that R typhi/Rickettsia spp, O tsutsugamushi, and Leptospira spp infections are important causes of CNS infections in Laos. Antibiotics, such as tetracyclines, needed for the treatment of murine typhus and scrub typhus, are not routinely advised for empirical treatment of CNS infections. These severely neglected infections represent a potentially large proportion of treatable CNS disease burden across vast endemic areas and need more attention. FUNDING: Wellcome Trust UK.
TI  - Quantitative proteomic analysis of sub-MIC erythromycin inhibiting biofilm formation of S. suis in vitro.
AB  - Streptococcus suis (S. suis) is a swine pathogen and also a zoonotic agent. Biofilms of S. suis may cause persistent infections by the host immune system and antibiotics. Sub-minimal inhibitory concentration (sub-MIC) of erythromycin can inhibit biofilm formation in bacteria. Here, we performed comparative proteomic analyses of cells at two different conditions: sub-MIC erythromycin treated and nontreated cells. Using iTRAQ strategy, we found some novel proteins that involved in biofilm formation. 79 differentially expressed proteins were identified in sub-MIC erythromycin inhibiting planktonic cell when the protein had both a fold-change of more that a ratio >1.2 or <0.8 (p-value <0.05). Several cell surface proteins (such as Primosomal protein N', l-fucose isomerase, and ABC superfamily ATP binding cassette transporter, membrane protein), as well as those involved in Quorum-sensing, were found to be implicated in biofilm formation. Overall, our results indicated that cell surface proteins played an important role in biofilm formation. Quorum-sensing played a crucial role leading to biofilm formation. ABC superfamily ATP binding cassette transporter, membrane protein and comD might act as channels for erythromycin uptake in Quorum-sensing system. Thus, our data analyzed rough regulatory pathways of biofilm formation that might potentially be exploited to deal with biofilm infections of S. suis. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Microbial Proteomics. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, we identified many proteins involved in cell transport, biological regulation and signal transduction, stress responses and other metabolic processes that were not previously known to be associated with biofilm formation of S. suis and target spot of erythromycin. Therefore, our manuscript represents the most comprehensive analysis of protein profiles of biofilm formation of S. suis inhibited by sub-MIC erythromycin and provides new proteomic information about biofilm formation.
TI  - Characterization of the pivotal carbon metabolism of Streptococcus suis serotype  2 under ex vivo and chemically defined in vitro conditions by isotopologue profiling.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is a neglected zoonotic pathogen that has to adapt to the nutritional requirements in the different host niches encountered during infection and establishment of invasive diseases. To dissect the central metabolic activity of S. suis under different conditions of nutrient availability, we performed labeling experiments starting from [(13)C]glucose specimens and analyzed the resulting isotopologue patterns in amino acids of S. suis grown under in vitro and ex vivo conditions. In combination with classical growth experiments, we found that S. suis is auxotrophic for Arg, Gln/Glu, His, Leu, and Trp in chemically defined medium. De novo biosynthesis was shown for Ala, Asp, Ser, and Thr at high rates and for Gly, Lys, Phe, Tyr, and Val at moderate or low rates, respectively. Glucose degradation occurred mainly by glycolysis and to a minor extent by the pentose phosphate pathway. Furthermore, the exclusive formation of oxaloacetate by phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylation became evident from the patterns in de novo synthesized amino acids. Labeling experiments with S. suis grown ex vivo in blood or cerebrospinal fluid reflected the metabolic adaptation to these host niches with different nutrient availability; however, similar key metabolic activities were identified under these conditions. This points at the robustness of the core metabolic pathways in S. suis during the infection process. The crucial role of PEP carboxylation for growth of S. suis in the host was supported by experiments with a PEP carboxylase-deficient mutant strain in blood and cerebrospinal fluid.
TI  - DnaJ of Streptococcus suis type 2 contributes to cell adhesion and thermotolerance.
AB  - To examine if molecular chaperones DnaK operon proteins of Streptococcus suis type 2 (SS2) are involved in adhesion to host cells, abundance of these proteins from the surface of two SS2 strains of different adhesion capability were compared. Their roles in growth and adhesion to human laryngeal epithelial cell line HEp-2 cells were investigated on SS2 strain HA9801 and its mutants with DnaK operon genes partially knocked-out (PKO mutant) under heat-stress. The major difference was that DnaJ was more abundant in strain HA9801 than in strain JX0811. Pretreatment of the bacteria with hyperimmune sera to DnaJ, but not with those to other proteins, could significantly reduce SS2 adhesion to HEp-2 cells. PKO of dnaJ gene resulted in decreased SS2 growth at 37 degrees C and 42 degrees C, and reduced its adhesion to HEp-2 cells. The wild-type strain stressed at 42 degrees C had increased expression of DnaJ on its surface and elevated adhesion to HEp-2 cells, which was also inhibitable by DnaJ specific antiserum. These results indicate that DnaJ of S. suis type 2 is important not only for thermotolerance but also for adhesion to host cells. Because DnaJ expression is increased upon temperature upshift with increased exposure on bacterial surface, the febrile conditions of the cases with systemic infections might help facilitate bacterial adhesion to host cells. DnaJ could be one of the potential candidates as a subunit vaccine because of its good immunogenicity.
TI  - In vitro transcriptome analysis of two Chinese isolates of Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - The Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S. suis 2) isolates 05ZYH33 and 98HAH33 have caused severe human infections in China. Using a strand-specific RNA-seq analysis, we compared the in vitro transcriptomes of these two Chinese isolates with that of a reference strain (P1/7). In the 89K genomic island that is specific to these Chinese isolates, a toxin-antitoxin system showed relatively high levels of transcription among the S. suis. The known virulence factors with high transcriptional activity in these two highly-pathogenic strains are mainly involved in adhesion, biofilm formation, hemolysis and the synthesis and transport of the outer membrane protein. Furthermore, our analysis of novel transcripts identified over 50 protein-coding genes with one of them encoding a toxin protein. We also predicted over 30 small RNAs (sRNAs) in each strain, and most of them are involved in riboswitches. We found that six sRNA candidates that are related to bacterial virulence, including cspA and rli38, are specific to Chinese isolates. These results provide insight into the factors responsible for the difference in virulence among the different S. suis 2 isolates.
TI  - Host-pathogen Interaction at the Intestinal Mucosa Correlates With Zoonotic Potential of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus suis has emerged as an important cause of bacterial meningitis in adults. The ingestion of undercooked pork is a risk factor for human S. suis serotype 2 (SS2) infection. Here we provide experimental evidence indicating that the gastrointestinal tract is an entry site of SS2 infection. METHODS: We developed a noninvasive in vivo model to study oral SS2 infection in piglets. We compared in vitro interaction of S. suis with human and porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IEC). RESULTS: Two out of 15 piglets showed clinical symptoms compatible with S. suis infection 24-48 hours after ingestion of SS2. SS2 was detected in mesenteric lymph nodes of 40% of challenged piglets. SS2 strains isolated from patients showed significantly higher adhesion to human IEC compared to invasive strains isolated from pigs. In contrast, invasive SS9 strains showed significantly higher adhesion to porcine IEC. Translocation across human IEC, which occurred predominately via a paracellular route, was significantly associated with clonal complex 1, the predominant zoonotic genotype. Adhesion and translocation were dependent on capsular polysaccharide production. CONCLUSIONS: SS2 should be considered a food-borne pathogen. S. suis interaction with human and pig IEC correlates with S. suis serotype and genotype, which can explain the zoonotic potential of SS2.
TI  - Identification of major Streptococcus suis serotypes 2, 7, 8 and 9 isolated from  pigs and humans in upper northeastern Thailand.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 infections occur in many provinces of north-eastern Thailand, knowledge concerning the prevalence of the common S. suis serotypes (1, 1/2, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9, 14 and 16) among healthy and diseased pigs in upper northeastern Thailand remains limited. This study investigated S. suis isolates from pigs (healthy and diseased) and also from humans using 11 conventional biochemical tests, 16S rDNA PCR and sequence analysis and multiplex PCR genotyping of porcine cps and gdh. Thirty-three isolates were obtained between 2009 and 2012 from blood or cerebrospinal fluid of patients from northeastern Thailand previously diagnosed with S. suis infection, based on clinical symptoms and laboratory diagnosis using 11 biochemical tests and PCR detection of 16S rDNA and cps. Eleven S. suis isolates were obtained between 2006 and 2009 from diseased pigs with clinical signs and laboratory diagnoses. In addition, 43 isolates obtained from 741 nasal swab cultures of slaughtered pigs between 2011 and 2012 were included. All three methods showed similar sensitivity in detection of S. suis from clinical and diseased pig specimens, although in healthy pigs, the 11 conventional biochemical methods yielded 2.3% false positives, and the gdh PCR detection method exhibited 31% false negatives. S. suis was present among healthy pigs in 8 of 10 provinces in upper northeastern Thailand, giving an average prevalence of 5.7% (range 1%-17%) using conventional methods together with 16S rDNA PCR assay. False positives by conventional methods were due to species with similar phenotypes, such as viridian streptococci, and are not statistically different from those obtained with the 16S rDNA PCR method, and the false negatives using gdh PCR assay will require further investigation. As S. suis was recovered from both diseased and healthy pigs, raw or undercooked pork products should be considered unsafe for handling or consumption in these regions of Thailand.
TI  - Molecular typing of Streptococcus suis isolates from Iberian pigs: a comparison with isolates from common intensively-reared commercial pig breeds.
AB  - The Iberian pig (IP) is a traditional Spanish breed variety of the domestic pig (Sus scrofa domesticus) with high economic importance because of the value of the dry-cured products in national and international markets. The genetic characteristics of tonsillar and clinical Streptococcus suis isolates from the IP maintained under extensive or intensive management conditions were investigated. S. suis isolates from IP pigs were compared with S. suis isolates from intensively-farmed pigs of common breeds (CBP). S. suis was isolated from 48.4% of the IP tonsils examined, indicating wide distribution among IP pigs. Serotypes 1 (9.4%), 2 (8.6%) and 9 (7%) were the most commonly found, although a high percentage of S. suis isolates were not typeable by coagglutination testing. No significant differences in carrier rates or serotype diversity were observed between management systems, indicating that intensive farming does not influence S. suis colonisation. Both pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multiple-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis showed a serotype-based distribution of S. suis IP isolates. Serotypes 1 and 2 S. suis isolates were grouped in the same cluster, whereas isolates of serotypes 9 and 7 were assigned to another cluster. All clinical and most tonsillar serotype 2 IP isolates were assigned to sequence type 1 (ST1) and exhibited the virulence genotype mrp+/epf+/sly+, indicating a high distribution of this genetic lineage among IP as well as a population of serotype 2 common to IPs and CBPs. The only clinical isolate of serotype 9 from IP was assigned to ST123, a sequence type associated with clinical isolates in CBPs in Spain.
TI  - Stepwise visualization of membrane pore formation by suilysin, a bacterial cholesterol-dependent cytolysin.
AB  - Membrane attack complex/perforin/cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (MACPF/CDC) proteins constitute a major superfamily of pore-forming proteins that act as bacterial virulence factors and effectors in immune defence. Upon binding to the membrane, they convert from the soluble monomeric form to oligomeric, membrane-inserted pores. Using real-time atomic force microscopy (AFM), electron microscopy (EM), and atomic structure fitting, we have mapped the structure and assembly pathways of a bacterial CDC in unprecedented detail and accuracy, focussing on suilysin from Streptococcus suis. We show that suilysin assembly is a noncooperative process that is terminated before the protein inserts into the membrane. The resulting ring-shaped pores and kinetically trapped arc-shaped assemblies are all seen to perforate the membrane, as also visible by the ejection of its lipids. Membrane insertion requires a concerted conformational change of the monomeric subunits, with a marked expansion in pore diameter due to large changes in subunit structure and packing.
TI  - A new recombinant SsnA protein combined with aluminum hydroxide protects mouse against Streptococcus suis.
AB  - An experimental challenge in a mouse model was used to select the most effective  adjuvant in a vaccine formulation with the surface-anchored DNA-nuclease (SsnA). We used a protocol based on clinical, histopathological, bacterial kinetics and immune response against S. suis serotype 2 in infected animals. The three adjuvants used, aluminum hydroxide (ALOH), incomplete Freund's adjuvant (FIA), oil-in-water adjuvant (OW) showed a protective effect against death by S. suis serotype 2 in this mouse model, although aluminum hydroxide revealed as the best option. Subsequently, in a second experimental assay, we showed that a recombinant SsnA protein combined with ALOH as adjuvant allowed a significant decrease of clinical and lesional findings in animals, faster reduction of the bacteria from organs and a highest humoral response against S. suis after 3 days post-infection. The results show that this combination (rSsnA+AlOH) could be a good vaccine formulation against S. suis, although further studies are necessary to evaluate their use for swine and human species.
TI  - Cloning, expression, and purification of a new antibacterial substance gene from  larvae of Musca domestica (Diptera: Muscidae).
AB  - Musca domestica L. (Diptera: Muscidae), the housefly, exhibits unique immune defenses and can produce antibacterial substances upon stimulation with bacteria. On the basis of the cDNA library constructed using the suppression subtractive hybridization method, a 1188-bp antibacterial substance gene, which we named AS566, was amplified by rapid amplification of cDNA ends from M. domestica larva stimulated with Salmonella pullorum (Enterobacteriaceae: Salmonella). In this study, the full-length AS566 gene was cloned and inserted into a His-tagged Escherichia coli (Enterobacteriaceae: Escherichia) prokaryotic expression system to enable production of the recombinant protein. The recombinant AS566 protein was purified in denatured form from inclusion bodies and renatured to obtain functionally active AS566 protein. The bacteriostatic activity of the recombinant purified AS566 protein was assessed using the Oxford plate assay system and the results indicated that AS566 had antibacterial activity against six bacteria, including an E. coli clinical isolate, S. pullorum, Streptococcus bovis (Streptococcaceae: Streptococcus), Streptococcus suis, and Staphylococcus aureus (Staphylococcaceae: Staphylococcus) in vitro. The antibacterial activity of AS566 toward Gram- bacteria was two times greater than that against Gram+ bacteria. The sequencing results and BLAST analysis showed that the antibacterial substance gene AS566 was not homologous to any other antibacterial substance genes in GenBank. The antibacterial mechanisms of the newly discovered AS566 protein warrant further study.
TI  - Identification of major Streptococcus suis serotypes 2, 7, 8 and 9 isolated from  pigs and humans in upper northeastern Thailand.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 infections occur in many provinces of north-eastern Thailand, knowledge concerning the prevalence of the common S. suis serotypes (1, 1/2, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9, 14 and 16) among healthy and diseased pigs in upper northeastern Thailand remains limited. This study investigated S. suis isolates from pigs (healthy and diseased) and also from humans using 11 conventional biochemical tests, 16S rDNA PCR and sequence analysis and multiplex PCR genotyping of porcine cps and gdh. Thirty-three isolates were obtained between 2009 and 2012 from blood or cerebrospinal fluid of patients from northeastern Thailand previously diagnosed with S. suis infection, based on clinical symptoms and laboratory diagnosis using 11 biochemical tests and PCR detection of 16S rDNA and cps. Eleven S. suis isolates were obtained between 2006 and 2009 from diseased pigs with clinical signs and laboratory diagnoses. In addition, 43 isolates obtained from 741 nasal swab cultures of slaughtered pigs between 2011 and 2012 were included. All three methods showed similar sensitivity in detection of S. suis from clinical and diseased pig specimens, although in healthy pigs, the 11 conventional biochemical methods yielded 2.3% false positives, and the gdh PCR detection method exhibited 31% false negatives. S. suis was present among healthy pigs in 8 of 10 provinces in upper northeastern Thailand, giving an average prevalence of 5.7% (range 1%-17%) using conventional methods together with 16S rDNA PCR assay. False positives by conventional methods were due to species with similar phenotypes, such as viridian streptococci, and are not statistically different from those obtained with the 16S rDNA PCR method, and the false negatives using gdh PCR assay will require further investigation. As S. suis was recovered from both diseased and healthy pigs, raw or undercooked pork products should be considered unsafe for handling or consumption in these regions of Thailand.
TI  - Novel variant serotype of streptococcus suis isolated from piglets with meningitis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an emerging zoonotic pathogen causing severe infections in  pigs and humans. In previous studies, 33 serotypes of S. suis have been identified using serum agglutination. Here, we describe a novel S. suis strain, CZ130302, isolated from an outbreak of acute piglet meningitis in eastern China. Strong pathogenicity of meningitis caused by strain CZ130302 was reproduced in the BALB/c mouse model. The strain showed a high fatality rate (8/10), higher than those for known virulent serotype 2 strains P1/7 (1/10) and 9801 (2/10). Cell adhesion assay results with bEnd.3 and HEp2 cells showed that CZ130302 was significantly close to P1/7 and 9801. Both the agglutination test and its complementary test showed that strain CZ130302 had no strong cross-reaction with the other 33 S. suis serotypes. The multiplex PCR assays revealed no specified bands for all four sets used to detect the other 33 serotypes. In addition, genetic analysis of the whole cps gene clusters of all serotypes was performed in this study. The results of comparative genomics showed that the cps gene cluster of CZ130302, which was not previously reported, showed no homology to the gene sequences of the other strains. Especially, the wzy, wzx, and acetyltransferase genes of strain CZ130302 are phylogenetically distinct from strains of the other 33 serotypes. Therefore, this study suggested that strain CZ130302 represents a novel variant serotype of S. suis (designated serotype Chz) which has a high potential to be virulent and associated with meningitis in animals.
TI  - Reappraisal of the taxonomy of Streptococcus suis serotypes 20, 22 and 26: Streptococcus parasuis sp. nov.
AB  - In order to clarify the taxonomic position of serotypes 20, 22 and 26 of Streptococcus suis, biochemical and molecular genetic studies were performed on isolates (SUT-7, SUT-286(T), SUT-319, SUT-328 and SUT-380) reacted with specific antisera of serotypes 20, 22 or 26 from the saliva of healthy pigs as well as reference strains of serotypes 20, 22 and 26. Comparative recN gene sequencing showed high genetic relatedness among our isolates, but marked differences from the type strain S. suis NCTC 10234(T), i.e. 74.8-75.7 % sequence similarity. The genomic relatedness between the isolates and other strains of species of the genus Streptococcus, including S. suis, was calculated using the average nucleotide identity values of whole genome sequences, which indicated that serotypes 20, 22 and 26 should be removed taxonomically from S. suis and treated as a novel genomic species. Comparative sequence analysis revealed 99.0-100 % sequence similarities for the 16S rRNA genes between the reference strains of serotypes 20, 22 and 26, and our isolates. Isolate STU-286(T) had relatively high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with S. suis NCTC 10234(T) (98.8 %). SUT-286(T) could be distinguished from S. suis and other closely related species of the genus Streptococcus using biochemical tests. Due to its phylogenetic and phenotypic similarities to S. suis we propose naming the novel species Streptococcus parasuis sp. nov., with SUT-286(T) ( = JCM 30273(T) = DSM 29126(T)) as the type strain.
TI  - Antibody response specific to the capsular polysaccharide is impaired in Streptococcus suis serotype 2-infected animals.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is an extracellular encapsulated bacterium that causes severe septicemia and meningitis in swine and humans. Albeit crucial in the fight against encapsulated bacteria, the nature of the capsular polysaccharide (CPS)-specific antibody (Ab) response during S. suis type 2 infection is unknown. We compared for the first time the features of CPS-specific versus protein-specific Ab responses during experimental infections with live virulent S. suis type 2 in mice. The primary protein-specific Ab response was dominated by both type 1 and 2 IgG subclasses, whereas IgM titers were more modest. The secondary protein-specific Ab response showed all of the features of a memory response with faster kinetics and boosted the titers of all Ig isotypes. In contrast, the primary CPS-specific Ab response was either inexistent or had titers only slightly higher than those in noninfected animals and was essentially composed of IgM. A poor CPS-specific memory response was observed, with only a moderate boost in IgM titers and no IgG. Both protein- and CPS-specific Ab responses were Toll-like receptor 2 independent. By using S. suis type 2 strains of European or North American origin, the poor CPS-specific Ab response was demonstrated to be independent of the genotypic/phenotypic diversity of the strain within serotype 2. Finally, the CPS-specific Ab response was also impaired and lacked isotype switching in S. suis-infected pigs, the natural host of the bacterium. The better resistance of preinfected animals to reinfection with the same strain of S. suis type 2 might thus more likely be related to the development of a protein rather than CPS Ab response.
TI  - A naturally occurring nucleotide polymorphism in the orf2/folc promoter is associated with Streptococcus suis virulence.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus suis is a major problem in the swine industry causing meningitis, arthritis and pericarditis in piglets. Pathogenesis of S. suis is poorly understood. We previously showed that introduction of a 3 kb genomic fragment from virulent serotype 2 strain 10 into a weakly virulent serotype 2 strain S735, generated a hypervirulent isolate. The 3 kb genomic fragment contained two complete open reading frames (ORF) in an operon-structure of which one ORF showed similarity to folylpolyglutamate synthetase, whereas the function of the second ORF could not be predicted based on database searches for protein similarity. RESULTS: In this study we demonstrate that introduction of orf2 from strain 10 into strain S735 is sufficient to dramatically increase the virulence of S735 in pigs. This increase in virulence could not be associated with changes in pro-inflammatory responses of porcine blood mononucleated cells in response to S. suis in vitro. Sequence analysis of the orf2-folC-operon of S. suis isolates 10 and S735 revealed an SNP in the -35 region of the putative promoter sequence of the operon, as well as several SNPs resulting in amino acid substitutions in the ORF2 protein. Transcript levels of orf2 and folC were significantly higher in the virulent strain 10 than in the weakly virulent strain S735 and in vitro mutagenesis of the orf2 promoter confirmed that this was due to a SNP in the predicted -35 region upstream of the orf2 promoter. In this study, we demonstrated that the stronger promoter was present in all virulent and highly virulent S. suis isolates included in our study. This highlights a correlation between high orf2 expression and virulence. Conversely, the weaker promoter was present in isolates known to be weakly pathogenic or non-pathogenic. CONCLUSION: In summary, we demonstrate the importance of orf2 in the virulence of S. suis.
TI  - [Enolase of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is involved in the antiphagocytosis of  Streptococcus suis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To prepare the recombinant enolase of Streptococcus suis (SsEno), analyze the effect of SsEno on the antiphagocytosis by antibody-blocking assay in the human blood bactericidal model, and identify the human fibrinogen (hFg)-binding activity of SsEno protein. METHODS: SsEno gene was amplified using the primers designed according to 05ZYH33 genome sequences and cloned into the expression vector pET28a to construct recombinant plasmids. The plasmids were transformed into E.coli BL21(DE3) and induced to express by IPTG. The expression level was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The recombinant proteins were purified by nickel affinity chromatography and identified by Western blotting. High-titer specific antiserum against SsEno was prepared by immunizing rabbits with the purified recombinant proteins. The impact of SsEno on antiphagocytosis was analyzed by antibody-blocking assay in the human blood bactericidal model. In addition, the specific binding activity with hFg was identified by Far-Western blotting and ELISA. RESULTS: The prokaryotic expression vector of hisSsEno (SsEno with His tag) was constructed and high-purity recombinant expressed protein was purified. In specific antibody blocking assay, antiserum against the SsEno significantly decreased the percent of survival bacteria as observed in high virulent strain 05ZYH33. Additionally, hisSsEno was proved to have the specific binding activity with hFg. CONCLUSION: SsEno was found to be a potential antiphagocytic factor of S. suis with a specific binding to hFg, suggesting that SsEno play an important role in antiphagocytosis of S. suis.
TI  - Serotype- and virulence-associated gene profile of Streptococcus suis isolates from pig carcasses in Chiang Mai Province, Northern Thailand.
AB  - In this present study, the serotype of 40 Streptococcus suis isolates from submaxillary glands of pig carcasses sold in wet markets in Chiang Mai Province, northern Thailand, was investigated. Eleven serotypes, including types 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 17, 21, 22 and 31, were found in the isolates by a Multiplex PCR combined with serum agglutination. Of the eleven serotypes present, type 3 was the most prevalent, while types 2, 4, 5 and 21 were of primary interest due to their human isolate serotype. The mrp+/epf - /sly - genotype was found to be the most prevalent genotype. This study indicates the importance of effective control of human S. suis infection due to raw pork or pig carcass handling in northern Thailand.
TI  - Bacterial etiologies of five core syndromes: laboratory-based syndromic surveillance conducted in Guangxi, China.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Under the existing national surveillance system in China for selected infectious diseases, bacterial cultures are performed for only a small percentage of reported cases. We set up a laboratory-based syndromic surveillance system to elucidate bacterial etiologic spectrum and detect infection by rare etiologies (or serogroups) for five core syndromes in the given study area. METHODS: Patients presenting with one of five core syndromes at nine sentinel hospitals in Guagnxi, China were evaluated using laboratory-based syndrome surveillance to elucidate bacterial etiologies. We collected respiratory and stool specimens, as well as CSF, blood and other related samples for bacterial cultures and pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) assays. RESULTS: From February 2009 to December 2011, 2,964 patients were enrolled in the study. Etiologies were identified in 320 (10.08%) patients. Streptococcus pneumonia (37 strains, 24.18%), Klebsiella pneumonia (34, 22.22%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19, 12.42%) and Haemophilus influenza (18, 11.76%) were the most frequent pathogens for fever and respiratory syndrome, while Salmonella (77, 81.05%) was most often seen in diarrhea syndrome cases. Salmonella paratyphi A (38, 86.36%) occurred in fever and rash syndrome, with Cryptococcus neoformans (20, 35.09%), Streptococcus pneumonia (5, 8.77%), Klebsiella pneumonia (5, 8.77%),streptococcus suis (3, 5.26%) and Neisseria meningitides group B (2, 3.51%) being the most frequently detected in encephalitis-meningitis syndrome. To date no pathogen was isolated from the specimens from fever and hemorrhage patients. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to common bacterial pathogens, opportunistic pathogens and fungal infections require more attention. Our study contributes to the strengthening of the existing national surveillance system and provides references for other regions that are similar to the study area.
TI  - The identification of six novel proteins with fibronectin or collagen type I binding activity from Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis, a major swine pathogen, is an emerging zoonotic agent that causes meningitis and septic shock. Bacterial cell wall and secreted proteins are often involved in interactions with extracellular matrix proteins (ECMs), which play important roles in the initial steps of pathogenesis. In this study, 2D SDS-PAGE, western blotting-based binding affinity measurements, and microtiter plate binding assays were used to identify cell wall and secreted proteins from S. suis that interact with fibronectin and collagen type I. We identified six proteins from S. suis, including three proteins (translation elongation factor G, oligopeptide-binding protein OppA precursor, and phosphoglycerate mutase) that show both fibronectin and collagen type I binding activity. To the best of our knowledge, these three newly identified proteins had no previously reported fibronectin or collagen type I binding activity. Overall, the aim in this study was to identify proteins with ECM binding activity from S. suis and it represents the first report of six new proteins from S. suis that interact with fibronectin or collagen type I.
TI  - Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in clinical isolates of Pasteurella multocida and Streptococcus suis from Ontario swine.
AB  - Susceptibility results for Pasteurella multocida and Streptococcus suis isolated  from swine clinical samples were obtained from January 1998 to October 2010 from the Animal Health Laboratory at the University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, and used to describe variation in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to 4 drugs of importance in the Ontario swine industry: ampicillin, tetracycline, tiamulin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Four temporal data-analysis options were used: visualization of trends in 12-month rolling averages, logistic-regression modeling, temporal-scan statistics, and a scan with the "What's strange about recent events?" (WSARE) algorithm. The AMR trends varied among the antimicrobial drugs for a single pathogen and between pathogens for a single antimicrobial, suggesting that pathogen-specific AMR surveillance may be preferable to indicator data. The 4 methods provided complementary and, at times, redundant results. The most appropriate combination of analysis methods for surveillance using these data included temporal-scan statistics with a visualization method (rolling-average or predicted-probability plots following logistic-regression models). The WSARE algorithm provided interesting results for quality control and has the potential to detect new resistance patterns; however, missing data created problems for displaying the results in a way that would be meaningful to all surveillance stakeholders.
TI  - Raw pig blood consumption and potential risk for Streptococcus suis infection, Vietnam.
AB  - We assessed consumption of raw pig blood, which is a risk factor for Streptococcus suis infection in Vietnam, by using a mix-method design. Factors associated with consumption included rural residency, age, sex, occupation, income, and marital status. We identified risk groups and practices and perceptions that should be targeted by communication programs.
TI  - Isolation of Streptococcus suis from 2 lambs with a history of lameness.
AB  - Streptococcus suis was isolated postmortem from 2 lambs with a history of lameness. Identity of S. suis was confirmed by species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. One isolate was untypable by serotyping and non-encapsulated, while the other isolate was serotype 33. The lambs had come from the same farm, and there was no evidence of contact between the lambs and pigs. Although the natural niche for S. suis is considered to be the pig, a wide range of host species may be affected by this pathogen.
TI  - Streptococcus suis meningoencephalitis with seizure from raw pork ingestion: a case report.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus suis meningoencephalitis is a rare but increasingly important condition. Good history taking will give clues to the diagnosis. This is the fourth case report in the United States. CASE: A 52-year-old Filipino man who recently returned from a trip to the Philippines was admitted with classic symptoms of bacterial meningitis. His cerebrospinal fluid culture grew Streptococcus suis. His clinical course was complicated by seizures, hearing loss, and permanent tinnitus. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should be aware of this emerging disease especially in patients with recent travel history to endemic areas. Early recognition and appropriate management could potentially prevent complications.
TI  - Establishment of a Cre recombinase based mutagenesis protocol for markerless gene deletion in Streptococcus suis.
AB  - The lack of knowledge about pathogenicity mechanisms of Streptococcus (S.) suis is, at least partially, attributed to limited methods for its genetic manipulation. Here, we established a Cre-lox based recombination system for markerless gene deletions in S. suis serotype 2 with high selective pressure and without undesired side effects.
TI  - [Comparison of monosaccharide composition of capsular polysaccharides in Streptococcus suis serotype 1, 2, 14 and 1/2].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There are one-way or two-way cross-reactions among Streptococcus suis  serotype 1, 2, 1/2 and 14, the reason to which was unknown. METHODS: The capsular polysaccharides of serotype 14 and 1/2 were purified on Sephacryl S-300 column and identified by phenol-sulphuric acid method and dot-ELISA. The molecular weight of the serotype 14 and 1/2 capsular polysaccharides was revealed as 487.38 kDa and 512.72 kDa by high performance gel permeation chromatography, respectively. RESULTS: The monosaccharide composition of serotype 14 and 1/2 capsular polysaccharides was determined as Glc/Gal/GlcNAc/Rha/Neu5Ac (1: 2.94 : 1.35 : 0.24 : 0.37) and Glc/Gal/GlcNAc/GalNAc/Rha/Neu5Ac (1 : 1.67 : 1.05 : 0.93: 0.72 : 0.7) by pre-column derivatization high performance liquid chromatography, fluorescent labeling HPLC and NMR, respectively. These were compared with the composition of serotype 1 and 2 capsular polysaccharides. Glc, GlcN, Gal and Neu5Ac was contained in the capsular polysaccharides of serotype 1, 2 14 and 1/2. But there is no prominent correlation between the monosaccharide composition and cross-reactions. The cross-reactions among them could be induced by the structure of the capsular polysaccharides and/or the other components on the cell wall.
TI  - Two Spx regulators modulate stress tolerance and virulence in Streptococcus suis  serotype 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is an important zoonotic pathogen causing severe infections in pigs and humans. The pathogenesis of S. suis 2 infections, however, is still poorly understood. Spx proteins are a group of global regulators involved in stress tolerance and virulence. In this study, we characterized two orthologs of the Spx regulator, SpxA1 and SpxA2 in S. suis 2. Two mutant strains (DeltaspxA1 and DeltaspxA2) lacking the spx genes were constructed. The DeltaspxA1 and DeltaspxA2 mutants displayed different phenotypes. DeltaspxA1 exhibited impaired growth in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, while DeltaspxA2 exhibited impaired growth in the presence of SDS and NaCl. Both mutants were defective in medium lacking newborn bovine serum. Using a murine infection model, we demonstrated that the abilities of the mutant strains to colonize the tissues were significantly reduced compared to that of the wild-type strain. The mutant strains also showed a decreased level of survival in pig blood. Microarray analysis revealed a global regulatory role for SpxA1 and SpxA2. Furthermore, we demonstrated for the first time that Spx is involved in triggering the host inflammatory response. Collectively, our data suggest that SpxA1 and SpxA2 are global regulators that are implicated in stress tolerance and virulence in S. suis 2.
TI  - Increased production of suilysin contributes to invasive infection of the Streptococcus suis strain 05ZYH33.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is widely recognized in the veterinary world  as the cause of rapidly progressive and fatal sepsis in infant pigs, manifested with meningitis, polyarthritis and pneumonia. It has evolved into a highly infectious strain, and caused two large-scale outbreaks of human epidemic in China, characterized bytypical toxic-shock syndrome and invasive infection. However, the molecular basis of virulence of this emerging zoonotic pathogen is still largely unknown. The present study shows that the sequence type (ST)7 epidemic strain S. suis 05ZYH33 causes higher mortality, higher necrosis of polymorphonuclear neutrophils and a significantly higher damage to human umbilical vein endothelial cells compared to the non-epidemic strain S. suis 1940. These differences appear to associate with the enhanced secretion of suilysin (sly) by S. suis 05ZYH33 compared to the non-epidemic strain 1940. Inclusion of additional strains confirmed that the epidemic ST7 strains produce more sly protein (mean, 1.49 g/ml; range, 0.761.91 g/ml) than nonepidemic strains (mean, 0.33 g/ml; range, 0.07-0.94 g/ml), and this difference is significant (P<0.001). The nonpolar mutant strain S. suis Deltasly, constructed from the epidemic ST7 strain S. suis 05ZYH33 confirmed the role of sly on the enhanced virulence of S. suis ST7 strains. These findings suggest that increased sly production in S. suis 05ZYH33 facilitates penetration to the epithelium and its survival in the bloodstream, thereby contributing to the invasive infection.
TI  - Development of an appropriate PCR system for the reclassification of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Thirty-five serotypes of Streptococcus suis (serotypes 1-34 and serotype 1/2) have so far been described on the basis of their polysaccharide capsular antigens. However, in the last decade, some serotype reference strains have been reexamined for their taxonomic status, and the reference strains of serotypes 20, 22, 26, 32, 33, and 34 may be different from taxon S. suis. In the present study, we developed a novel PCR method targeting the recombination/repair protein (recN) gene of S. suis, designated recN PCR, which corresponds to the current reclassification of this bacterium. We compared its specificity with other PCR methods for S. suis, and the results obtained confirmed its specificity. In addition, the detection limits of recN PCR were similar among all the reference strains of authentic S. suis, indicating that the recN PCR gave reliable results against bacterial strains and isolates used in this study. Therefore, recN PCR described in the present study will be a useful tool for the identification of authentic S. suis, and can also be used in epidemiological studies on this bacterium.
TI  - Construction, characterization and evaluation of the protective efficacy of the Streptococcus suis double mutant strain DeltaSsPep/DeltaSsPspC as a live vaccine candidate in mice.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S. suis 2) causes sepsis and meningitis in piglets and humans, and results in one of the most serious bacterial diseases affecting the production of commercial pigs around the world. Due to the failure of the current inactivated vaccine to protect against the disease, development of a new attenuated live vaccine against S. suis 2 by deleting essential virulence factors is urgently needed. We have previously reported the construction and characterization of an SsPep single gene deletion mutant strain DeltaSsPep based on S. suis 2. Our previous results have shown that SsPep plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of S. suis 2. In this study, a precisely defined double-deletion mutant DeltaSsPep/DeltaSsPspC of S. suis 2 without antibiotic-resistance markers was constructed based on DeltaSsPep, and the levels of virulence of the wild-type (WT) and DeltaSsPep/DeltaSsPspC were compared in a mouse experimental infection model. We demonstrated that the double mutant DeltaSsPep/DeltaSsPspC was less virulent than the WT, and could induce a noticeable antibody response. Analysis of IgG subclasses (IgG1 and IgG2a) indicated that both Th1 and Th2 responses were induced by DeltaSsPep/DeltaSsPspC, although the IgG2a (Th1) response predominated over the IgG1 (Th2) response. Moreover, DeltaSsPep/DeltaSsPspC could confer 90% protective efficacy against challenge with a lethal dose of fully virulent S. suis 2. Taken together, these data demonstrate that DeltaSsPep/DeltaSsPspC can be used as an effective live vaccine and provide a novel strategy against infection of S. suis 2.
TI  - [Acute bacterial meningitis as an occupational disease].
AB  - Streptococcus suis is a zoonotic pathogen with worldwide distribution, responsible for more than 700 human cases globally reported. This infection affects mostly men, exposed to pig or pork, which leads to its usual classification as an occupational disease. We report a case of acute bacterial meningitis in a 44 years old male. According to his past medical history, the patient had chronic alcoholism and worked in a restaurant as a piglet roaster. Microbiological examination of blood and CSF revealed S. suis. After 14 days of ceftriaxone the patient fully recovered. The authors review the clinical reports previously described in Portugal. In all of them was possible to identify risk exposition to pork. We alert to this microorganism's importance in Portugal where it is probably underdiagnosed.
TI  - Assessment of the pathogenesis of Streptococcus suis type 2 infection in piglets  for understanding streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome, meningitis, and sequelae.
AB  - Streptococcus suis type 2 (SS2) is an zoonotic pathogen that had caused outbreaks in 1998 and 2005 in China. It is still not very clear how the disease progresses into the streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome (STSLS) or meningitis, as well as the sequelae from the survivals. The present study used piglets as infection model to systematically investigate the pathogenesis of the infection caused by the SS2 strain 05ZYH33. The infected piglets showed joint swelling, lameness, and crouch at beginning, then developed into septic-like shock syndrome (SLSS) or prostration syndrome, at last the survivals showed physical activity impairment. The morbidity and mortality were 100% (71% for SLSS, 29% for prostration syndrome) and 29%, respectively. The pigs exhibiting SLSS had deep invasive infections in tissues and organs, and displayed more severe bacteremia and cytokine secretion in the bloodstream and organs than pigs with prostration syndrome. Moreover, the polymorphisms in the toll-like receptor 1 (TLR1) and TLR2 genes varied between the pigs affected with SLSS and prostration syndrome. Several lines of evidence indicated that SS2 infection progression into SLSS or relatively lighter prostration syndrome in pigs is closely related to the degrees of bacteremia and cytokine storm, which may be inherently determined by the diversity of innate immunity-associated genes. Furthermore, brain lesions, such as venous thrombosis, may directly contribute to the sequelae in human cases, were identified in the pigs. These results might help us to further understand the pathogenesis of SS2 in humans.
TI  - Identification and characterisation a surface-associated arginine peptidase in Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important zoonotic pathogen worldwide and is responsible for disease in swine and humans. In the present study, we identified and characterised a surface-associated peptidase (abpb, amylase-binding protein B) in Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S. suis 2) that has high hydrolytic activity towards H-Arg-pNa, with maximum activity at pH 7.0. Stimulation of RAW 264.7 macrophages with purified recombinant abpb protein triggered the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. An abpb-deficient mutant DeltaAbpb was constructed by homologous recombination to determine the role of abpb in S. suis 2. The mutant DeltaAbpb showed decreased adherence to Hep-2 cells and attenuated virulence in a mouse model compared to the wild type strains. The results of the infection showed impaired bacterial growth in vivo and poor colonisation of the organs. In a protection assay, the recombinant abpb provided excellent protection against a lethal challenge of S. suis 2. Together, these findings suggest that abpb contributes to the pathogenicity of S. suis 2 and may be another target for S. suis prevention and control.
TI  - The arginine-ornithine antiporter ArcD contributes to biological fitness of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - The arginine-ornithine antiporter (ArcD) is part of the Arginine Deiminase System (ADS), a catabolic, energy-providing pathway found in a variety of different bacterial species, including the porcine zoonotic pathogen Streptococcus suis. The ADS has recently been shown to play a role in the pathogenicity of S. suis, in particular in its survival in host cells. The contribution of arginine and arginine transport mediated by ArcD, however, has yet to be clarified. In the present study, we showed by experiments using [U-(13)C6]arginine as a tracer molecule that S. suis is auxotrophic for arginine and that bacterial growth depends on the uptake of extracellular arginine. To further study the role of ArcD in arginine metabolism, we generated an arcD-specific mutant strain and characterized its growth compared to the wild-type (WT) strain, a virulent serotype 2 strain. The mutant strain showed a markedly reduced growth in chemically defined media supplemented with arginine when compared to the WT strain, suggesting that ArcD promotes arginine uptake. To further evaluate the in vivo relevance of ArcD, we studied the intracellular bacterial survival of the arcD mutant strain in an epithelial cell culture infection model. The mutant strain was substantially attenuated, and its reduced intracellular survival rate correlated with a lower ability to neutralize the acidified environment. Based on these results, we propose that ArcD, by its function as an arginine-ornithine antiporter, is important for supplying arginine as substrate of the ADS and, thereby, contributes to biological fitness and virulence of S. suis in the host.
TI  - Breed-specific transcriptome response of spleen from six to eight week old piglet after infection with Streptococcus suis type 2.
AB  - Different pig breeds have shown differential susceptibility to the pathogen infection; however, molecular mechanisms of the infection susceptibility are not fully understood. Streptococcus suis type 2 (SS2) is an important zoonotic pathogen. To identify the genes responsible for infection susceptibility, pigs from two different breeds (Enshi black and Landrace) were inoculated with SS2 and their spleen transcriptome profiles were investigated in the present study. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed from infected versus control pigs in each breed, and then compared between both pig breeds. Enshi black pig showed more DEGs than Landrace (830 vs. 611) and most of these were due to down-regulated genes (543 vs. 387). However some DEGs were uniquely expressed in one breed, some were expressed in opposite direction in both breeds. A number of candidate genes and pathways are identified which might be involved in susceptibility to SS2, for example, MMP9 and Resistin were only significantly expressed in Landrace. NPG3 and PMAP23 were up-regulated in Landrace whereas down-regulated in Enshi black. LENG8 in control Landrace have inherently higher expression than control Enshi black. IGKV6 is down-regulated in Landrace but up-regulated in Enshi black. Overall, the transcriptome profiles are consistent with the clinical signs, i.e. the Enshi black is more susceptible to SS2 infection than Landrace. This is the first study to identify differential gene expression between indigenous and modern commercial pigs after in vivo SS2 infection using RNA-seq. The significant DEGs in splenic profiles between two pig breeds suggested considerable involvement of genetic background in susceptibility to the SS2 infection in pigs.
TI  - Whole-Genome Sequence of Streptococcus suis Serotype 4 Reference Strain 6407.
AB  - We report here the second complete genome sequence of Streptococcus suis serotype 4 (strain 6407). The genome is 2,292,360 bp in length, covering 2,239 coding sequences, 58 tRNAs, and 4 rRNA loci.

TI  - Genetic diversity of Streptococcus suis isolated from three pig farms of China obtained by acquiring antibiotic resistance genes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acquiring antibiotic resistance genes may change an organism's genetic characteristics and the effect of antibiotics, resulting in a rapid transmission of microbial pathogens. The objectives of this experiment were to identify the features of Streptococcus suis (S. suis) isolated from three pig farms in China which are geographically isolated. RESULTS: Among the isolates, 56.52% were sequence type 7 (ST7), followed by ST1 (26.09%), indicating that ST7 prevails in China, as revealed by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). Statistical analysis indicated an association between geography, sequence types and antibiotic resistance genotypes. 66.67% of the isolates in Sichuan province presented a (ermB(-) + mefA(-) + tetO(-) + tetM(-)) + ST7 type. The tetM(+) +ST7 type was the most prevalent in Jiangsu province, whereas the strains from Hebei province had a phenotype ermB(+) +tetO(+) +ST1 (63.64%). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PGFE) pattern A2 with 100% similarity reflected the clonal dissemination between Sichuan and Jiangsu provinces. Strains carrying or not carrying antibiotic resistance genes presented different PFGE patterns in Hebei province. CONCLUSION: ST7 is widespread in many regions of China and a clonal dissemination occurred between Sichuan and Jiangsu provinces in diseased pigs. However, ST1 strains with macrolide and tetracycline resistance (ermB(+) +tetO(+) +ST1) isolated from a farm in Hebei province demonstrated that the genetic diversity was contributed by horizontal acquiring of ermB and tetO carrying elements.
TI  - Population analysis of Streptococcus suis isolates from slaughtered swine by use  of minimum core genome sequence typing.
AB  - Streptococcus suis, an important zoonotic pathogen, is a highly diverse species with only a subset of strains that cause disease in humans. Our previous study proposed a minimum core genome (MCG) sequence typing method and defined seven MCG groups, with MCG group 1 as the prevalent group causing human infections. In this study, we identified a set of 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distributed in six genes that were used to identify the seven MCG groups. The 10 SNPs were typed for 179 S. suis isolates collected from slaughtered pigs. The most prevalent groups among the tested isolates were MCG groups 6 and 7. Most of the isolates (147/179) were genotyped as mrp negative, epf negative, sly negative, and CDS2157 positive. The 179 isolates were also typed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and divided into 115 sequence types (STs), 111 of which were new. The 6 serotypes (29, 11, 5, 12, 30, and 2) represented 72.3% of the serotyped isolates. Our data show that the typing assay facilitates the application of genome data to the surveillance of S. suis.
TI  - Catabolite control protein A is an important regulator of metabolism in type 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis (S. suis) type 2 is an extremely important Gram-positive bacterial pathogen that can cause human or swine endocarditis, meningitis, bronchopneumonia, arthritis and sepsis. Catabolite control protein A (CcpA) is a major transcriptional regulator in S. suis type 2 that functions in catabolite control, specifically during growth on glucose or galactose. The regulation of central metabolism can affect the virulence of bacteria. In the present study, a metabolomics approach was used along with principal components analysis (PCA) and partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) models and 37 metabolites were found that differed substantially between native S. suis and a mutant lacking CcpA. These results showed that CcpA is an important protein in S. suis type 2 for studying bacterial protein function.
TI  - Characterization of DNase activity and gene in Streptococcus suis and evidence for a role as virulence factor.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is an important swine pathogen and emerging zoonotic agent. Multilocus sequence typing allowed dividing S. suis serotype 2 into sequence types (STs). The three major STs of S. suis serotype 2 from North America are 1 (most virulent), 25 (intermediate virulence) and 28 (less virulent). Although the presence of DNase activity in S. suis has been previously reported, little data is available. The aim of this study was to investigate DNase activity in S. suis according to STs, to characterize the activity and gene, and to provide evidence for a potential role in virulence. RESULTS: We showed that ST1 and ST28 strains exhibited DNase activity that was absent in ST25 strains. The lack of activity in ST25 isolates was associated with a 14-bp deletion resulting in a shifted reading frame and a premature stop codon. The DNase of S. suis P1/7 (ST1) was cell-associated and active on linear DNA. A DNase-deficient mutant of S. suis P1/7 was found to be less virulent in an amoeba model. Stimulation of macrophages with the DNase mutant showed a decreased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinase-9 compared to the parental strain. CONCLUSIONS: This study further expands our knowledge of S. suis DNase and its potential role in virulence.
TI  - The truncated major pilin subunit Sbp2 of the srtBCD pilus cluster still contributes to Streptococcus suis pathogenesis in the absence of pilus shaft.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is an emerging zoonotic agent responsible for a number of infections in pigs and humans. Pili have been proposed as virulence factors in Gram-positive bacteria. However, due to the abolition of pili production, the function of the srtBCD pilus cluster, especially the truncated major pilin subunit Sbp2 (Sbp2', Sbp2''), has not been explored. In this study, isogenic mutants (Deltasbp2', Deltasbp2'') were constructed by homologous replacement in SS2 strain P1/7. Deletion of sbp2' attenuated the virulence in a zebrafish model as shown by more than an eightfold increase in the LD50 of Deltasbp2', compared with that of the parent strain. In addition, the adhesion of Deltasbp2' to HEp-2 cell monolayers decreased significantly. Compared with the parent strain, no obvious differences in virulence and adherence efficiency were observed for Deltasbp2''. Our data suggest that Sbp2' could be involved in SS2 pathogenesis despite absence of its pilus shaft.
TI  - Heat incubation inactivates streptococcal exotoxins and recombinant cholesterol-dependent cytolysins: suilysin, pneumolysin and streptolysin O.
AB  - Streptococcus species release cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs), which are  a main toxin, and their heat susceptibility is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to clarify the heat susceptibility of streptococcal exotoxins and CDCs. Streptococcal exotoxins were treated with heat incubation at 60 degrees C for 10 or 30 min. The Streptococcus suis exotoxin of serotypes 1 and 2 exhibited more than 50 % haemolytic activity, and all Streptococcus pneumoniae exotoxins exhibited more than 60 % haemolytic activity. During the thermolabile assay, the virulent streptococcal haemolytic activity remarkably decreased after being heated at 60 degrees C for 10 m. Then, streptococcal recombinant CDCs were produced and put through a thermolabile assay. The haemolytic activity of suilysin (SLY), pneumolysin (PLY) and streptolysin O (SLO) decreased more than 80 % after heat incubation. We also conducted a TER assay to evaluate the cell monolayer. The cell monolayer of all CDCs broke down, and the FITC-dextran translocated at 1 h post addition, while the CDCs treated with heating did not induce cell disruption. Moreover, the microscopy analysis demonstrated that CDCs treated with heating lost their activity. In conclusion, heat incubation induced the inactivation of streptococcal exotoxins and CDCs. Heat incubation plays a role in the degradation of the streptococcal exotoxin, and this result applies to the inhibition of streptococcal infection.
TI  - Suicin 90-1330 from a nonvirulent strain of Streptococcus suis: a nisin-related lantibiotic active on gram-positive swine pathogens.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is known to cause severe infections (meningitis, endocarditis, and septicemia) in pigs and is considered an emerging zoonotic agent. Antibiotics have long been used in the swine industry for disease treatment/prevention and growth promoters. This pattern of utilization resulted in the spread of antibiotic resistance in S. suis worldwide. Interestingly, pigs may harbor S. suis in their tonsils without developing diseases, while North American strains belonging to the sequence type 28 (ST28) are nonvirulent in animal models. Consequently, the aim of this study was to purify and characterize a bacteriocin produced by a nonvirulent strain of S. suis serotype 2, with a view to a potential therapeutic and preventive application. S. suis 90-1330 belonging to ST28 and previously shown to be nonvirulent in an animal model exhibited antibacterial activity toward all S. suis pathogenic isolates tested. The bacteriocin produced by this strain was purified to homogeneity by cationic exchange and reversed-phase fast protein liquid chromatography. Given its properties (molecular mass of <4 kDa, heat, pH and protease stability, and the presence of modified amino acids), the bacteriocin, named suicin 90-1330, belongs to the lantibiotic class. Using a DNA-binding fluorophore, the bacteriocin was found to possess a membrane permeabilization activity. When tested on other swine pathogens, the suicin showed activity against Staphylococcus hyicus and Staphylococcus aureus, whereas it was inactive against all Gram-negative bacteria tested. Amino acid sequencing of the purified bacteriocin showed homology (90.9% identity) with nisin U produced by Streptococcus uberis. The putative gene cluster involved in suicin production was amplified by PCR and sequence analysis revealed the presence of 11 open reading frames, including the structural gene and those required for the modification of amino acids, export, regulation, and immunity. Further studies will evaluate the ability of suicin 90-1330 or the producing strain to prevent experimental S. suis infections in pigs.
TI  - Streptococcus suis sorption on agricultural soils: role of soil physico-chemical  properties.
AB  - Understanding pathogen sorption on natural soil particles is crucial to protect public health from soilborne and waterborne diseases. Sorption of pathogen Streptococcus suis on 10 agricultural soils was examined, and its correlations with soil physico-chemical properties were also elucidated. S. suis sorption isotherms conformed to the linear equation, with partition coefficients (Ks) ranging from 12.7 mL g(-1) to 100.1 mL g(-1). Bacteria were observed to sorb on the external surfaces of soil aggregates by scanning electron microscopy. Using Pearson correlation and linear regression analysis, solution pH was found to have significant negative correlations with Ks. Stepwise multiple regression and path analysis revealed that pH and cation exchange capacity (CEC) were the main factors influencing sorption behaviors. The obtained overall model (Ks=389.6-45.9xpH-1.3xCEC, R(2)=0.943, P<0.001) can accurately predict Ks values. However, the variability in Ks was less dependent on soil organic matter, specific surface area, soil texture and zeta potential, probably due to the internal-surface shielding phenomenon of soil aggregates. Additionally, the sorption trends cannot be interpreted by interaction energy barriers calculated using the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory, suggesting the limits of DLVO theory in describing pathogen sorption on natural soils. Our results also indicated soil pH and CEC should be preferentially considered when modeling S. suis sorption process.
TI  - Control of competence for DNA transformation in streptococcus suis by genetically transferable pherotypes.
AB  - Here we show that S. suis, a major bacterial pathogen of pigs and emerging pathogen in humans responds to a peptide pheromone by developing competence for DNA transformation. This species does not fall within any of the phylogenetic clusters of streptococci previously shown to regulate competence via peptide pheromones suggesting that more species of streptococci may be naturally competent. Induction of competence was dependent on ComX, a sigma factor that controls the streptococcal late competence regulon, extracellular addition of a comX-inducing peptide (XIP), and ComR, a regulator of comX. XIP was identified as an N-terminally truncated variant of ComS. Different comS alleles are present among strains of S. suis. These comS alleles are not functionally equivalent and appear to operate in conjuction with a cognate ComR to regulate comX through a conserved comR-box promoter. We demonstrate that these 'pherotypes' can be genetically transferred between strains, suggesting that similar approaches might be used to control competence induction in other lactic acid bacteria that lack ComR/ComS homologues but possess comX and the late competence regulon. The approaches described in this paper to identify and optimize peptide-induced competence may also assist other researchers wishing to identify natural competence in other bacteria. Harnessing natural competence is expected to accelerate genetic research on this and other important streptococcal pathogens and to allow high-throughput mutation approaches to be implemented, opening up new avenues for research.
TI  - Impact of antibiotic use in the swine industry.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance in bacteria associated with pigs not only affects pig production but also has an impact on human health through the transfer of resistant organisms and associated genes via the food chain. This can compromise treatment of human infections. In the past most attention was paid to glycopeptide and streptogramin resistance in enterococci, fluoroquinolone resistance in campylobacter and multi-drug resistance in Escherichia coli and salmonella. While these are still important the focus has shifted to ESBL producing organisms selected by the use of ceftiofur and cefquinome in pigs. In addition Livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) suddenly emerged in 2007. We also need to consider multi-resistant strains of Streptococcus suis. Environmental contamination arising from piggery wastewater and spreading of manure slurry on pastures is also a growing problem.
TI  - Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and outcomes of Streptococcus suis infection in humans.
AB  - Streptococcus suis, a bacterium that affects pigs, is a neglected pathogen that causes systemic disease in humans. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize global estimates of the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of this zoonosis. We searched main literature databases for all studies through December 2012 using the search term "streptococcus suis." The prevalence of S. suis infection is highest in Asia; the primary risk factors are occupational exposure and eating of contaminated food. The pooled proportions of case-patients with pig-related occupations and history of eating high-risk food were 38.1% and 37.3%, respectively. The main clinical syndrome was meningitis (pooled rate 68.0%), followed by sepsis, arthritis, endocarditis, and endophthalmitis. The pooled case-fatality rate was 12.8%. Sequelae included hearing loss (39.1%) and vestibular dysfunction (22.7%). Our analysis identified gaps in the literature, particularly in assessing risk factors and sequelae of this infection.
TI  - Latest developments on Streptococcus suis: an emerging zoonotic pathogen: part 2.
AB  - First International Workshop on Streptococcus suis, Beijing, China, 12-13 August  2013. This second and final chapter of the report on the First International Workshop on Streptococcus suis follows on from Part 1, published in the April 2014, volume 9, issue 4 of Future Microbiology. S. suis is a swine pathogen and a zoonotic agent afflicting people in close contact with infected pigs or pork meat. Although sporadic cases of human infections had been reported worldwide, deadly S. suis outbreaks emerged in Asia. The severity of the disease underscores the lack of knowledge on the virulence and zoonotic evolution of this human-infecting agent. The pathogenesis of the infection, interactions with host cells and new avenues for treatments were among the topics discussed during the First International Workshop on S. suis (China 2013).
TI  - Gluconate 5-dehydrogenase (Ga5DH) participates in Streptococcus suis cell division.
AB  - Bacterial cell division is strictly regulated in the formation of equal daughter  cells. This process is governed by a series of spatial and temporal regulators, and several new factors of interest to the field have recently been identified. Here, we report the requirement of gluconate 5-dehydrogenase (Ga5DH) in cell division of the zoonotic pathogen Streptococcus suis. Ga5DH catalyzes the reversible reduction of 5-ketogluconate to D-gluconate and was localized to the site of cell division. The deletion of Ga5DH in S. suis resulted in a plump morphology with aberrant septa joining the progeny. A significant increase was also observed in cell length. These defects were determined to be the consequence of Ga5DH deprivation in S. suis causing FtsZ delocalization. In addition, the interaction of FtsZ with Ga5DH in vitro was confirmed by protein interaction assays. These results indicate that Ga5DH may function to prevent the formation of ectopic Z rings during S. suis cell division.
TI  - Characterization of multi-drug tolerant persister cells in Streptococcus suis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Persister cells constitute a subpopulation of dormant cells within a  microbial population which are genetically identical but phenotypically different to regular cells. Notably, persister cells show an elevated tolerance to antimicrobial agents. Thus, they are considered to represent a microbial 'bet-hedging' strategy and are of particular importance in pathogenic bacteria. RESULTS: We studied the ability of the zoonotic pathogen Streptococcus (S.) suis to form multi-drug tolerant variants and identified persister cells dependent on the initial bacterial growth phase. We observed lower numbers of persisters in exponential phase cultures than in stationary growth phase populations. S. suis persister cells showed a high tolerance to a variety of antibiotics, and the phenotype was not inherited as tested with four passages of S. suis populations. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the persister phenotype is related to expression of genes involved in general metabolic pathways since we found higher numbers of persister cells in a mutant strain defective in the catabolic arginine deiminase system as compared to its parental wild type strain. Finally, we observed persister cell formation also in other S. suis strains and pathogenic streptococcal species. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, this is the first study that reports multi-drug tolerant persister cells in the zoonotic pathogen S. suis.
TI  - [Clinics, diagnosis and prophylaxis of a Streptococcus suis serotype 7 farm problem].
AB  - In an Austrian piglet producing farm with 1500 sows a high incidence of meningitis, arthritis and sudden death was recorded in five to eight week old piglets. Overall losses were 1.8%. Streptococcus (S.) suis serotype 7 was detected with an intermediate to high specific bacterial load in all samples taken from brains and joints of 17 untreated piglets with typical clinical signs. All isolates showed an identical spectrum of virulence-associated genes (mrp+, epf-, ofs-, sly-) and expressed a relatively small variant of MRP (Muramidase-Released Protein) called MRPs. A bacterin was produced using four of the S. suis serotype 7 isolates. An untreated and non-vaccinated control group A with 957 piglets, a non-vaccinated but amoxicillin-treated group B with 1012 piglets and an untreated group C with 998 piglets, which was vaccinated twice in the first and third week of life, were compared. Later, an additional group D with 290 piglets was vaccinated twice in the fourth and sixth week of life. Amoxicillin treatment in group B resulted in the lowest mortality and morbidity rate. Furthermore, the incidence of lameness and losses were significantly lower in vaccinated pigs compared to the control group. In an ex vivo blood survival assay, a strong bactericidal effect of the post immune sera of group D animals was found. This is likely due to the presence of specific opsonizing antibodies against S. suis elicited through vaccination and associated with the protective efficacy of the vaccine.
TI  - Scabies mites alter the skin microbiome and promote growth of opportunistic pathogens in a porcine model.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The resident skin microbiota plays an important role in restricting pathogenic bacteria, thereby protecting the host. Scabies mites (Sarcoptes scabiei) are thought to promote bacterial infections by breaching the skin barrier and excreting molecules that inhibit host innate immune responses. Epidemiological studies in humans confirm increased incidence of impetigo, generally caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, secondary to the epidermal infestation with the parasitic mite. It is therefore possible that mite infestation could alter the healthy skin microbiota making way for the opportunistic pathogens. A longitudinal study to test this hypothesis in humans is near impossible due to ethical reasons. In a porcine model we generated scabies infestations closely resembling the disease manifestation in humans and investigated the scabies associated changes in the skin microbiota over the course of a mite infestation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In a 21 week trial, skin scrapings were collected from pigs infected with S. scabies var. suis and scabies-free control animals. A total of 96 skin scrapings were collected before, during infection and after acaricide treatment, and analyzed by bacterial 16S rDNA tag-encoded FLX-titanium amplicon pyrosequencing. We found significant changes in the epidermal microbiota, in particular a dramatic increase in Staphylococcus correlating with the onset of mite infestation in animals challenged with scabies mites. This increase persisted beyond treatment from mite infection and healing of skin. Furthermore, the staphylococci population shifted from the commensal S. hominis on the healthy skin prior to scabies mite challenge to S. chromogenes, which is increasingly recognized as being pathogenic, coinciding with scabies infection in pigs. In contrast, all animals in the scabies-free cohort remained relatively free of Staphylococcus throughout the trial. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first experimental in vivo evidence supporting previous assumptions that establishment of pathogens follow scabies infection. Our findings provide an explanation for a biologically important aspect of the disease pathogenesis. The methods developed from this pig trial will serve as a guide to analyze human clinical samples. Studies building on this will offer implications for development of novel intervention strategies against the mites and the secondary infections.

TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility monitoring of respiratory tract pathogens isolated from diseased cattle and pigs across Europe: the VetPath study.
AB  - VetPath is an ongoing pan-European antibiotic susceptibility monitoring programme collecting pathogens from diseased antimicrobial non-treated cattle, pigs and poultry. In the current study, 1001 isolates from cattle and pig respiratory tract infections were tested for their antimicrobial susceptibilities. Non-replicate lung samples or nasopharyngeal/nasal swabs were collected from animals with acute clinical signs in 11 countries during 2002-2006. Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica from cattle and P. multocida, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and Streptococcus suis from pigs were isolated by standard methods. S. suis was also isolated from meningitis cases. MICs of 16 antibiotics were assessed centrally by broth microdilution following CLSI recommendations. Results were interpreted using CLSI breakpoints where available. P. multocida (231) and M. haemolytica (138) isolates were all susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftiofur, enrofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Resistance to florfenicol and spectinomycin was 0.4% and 3.5% in P. multocida, respectively, and absent in M. haemolytica isolates. Tetracycline resistance was 5.7% and 14.6% for P. multocida and M. haemolytica. In pigs, 230 P. multocida, 220 A. pleuropneumoniae and 182 S. suis isolates were recovered. Resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, florfenicol, tiamulin and tilmicosin was absent or <1%. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole resistance was 3-6% and tetracycline resistance varied from 14.7% in A. pleuropneumoniae to 81.8% in S. suis. In conclusion, low resistance to antibiotics with defined clinical breakpoints, except for tetracycline, was observed among the major respiratory tract pathogens recovered from cattle and pigs. Since for approximately half of the antibiotics in this panel no CLSI-defined breakpoints were available, setting of the missing veterinary breakpoints is important.
TI  - Overexpression of an ABC transporter and mutations of GyrA, GyrB, and ParC in contributing to high-level ciprofloxacin resistance in Streptococcus suis type 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is a pathogen of zoonotic diseases. Moreover, the emergence of fluoro-quinolones (FQs) resistance in this pathogen has severe consequences for pigs and human health. In this study, the molecular mechanism of FQs resistance in S. suis type 2 (SS2) sensitive strains isolated from pigs was assessed after in vitro induction of resistance against the most frequently used FQs: ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and enrofloxacin. Proteome analysis, sequencing and real-time RT-PCR results strongly established an overexpression of an ABC transporter protein (other than SatAB) and topoisomerase mutations in GyrA (Ser81Arg), GyrB (Glu354Lys), and ParC (Ser79Phe) in contributing to high level ciprofloxacin resistance in SS2. Due to the overexpression of the ABC transporter, intracellular ciprofloxacin concentrations were significantly lower in the resistant strains than those of sensitive strains after 20, 35, and 60 min exposures to ciprofloxacin (p < 0.05). It was concluded that improper use of FQs is one of the main causes of the emergence of this zoonotic pathogen as a multiresistant organism against commonly used antibiotics. The existence of an efflux-like protein is an incentive to find new drug targets to avoid the spread of FQs-resistant S. suis isolates in pigs and the human population.
TI  - Effect of Tran on virulence through regulating metabolism and stress tolerance of Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis (SS) is an important zoonotic pathogen causing a variety of life-threatening infections in pigs and humans. Tran, a novel transcriptional regulator which was identified to be an infection-related factor in S. suis serotype 2 using suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH), has been reported by our group. In this study, a tran deletion mutant was constructed to compare with the wild-type ZY05719 in some biological characteristics. It is suggested that longer chains and relatively slower growth could be observed in tran deletion mutants. In order to identify gene transcription profiles, microarray analysis was performed. It indicated that the inactivation of Tran led to 130 differentially expressed genes spread throughout the genome. Among these, 21 genes were upregulated, and 109 genes were downregulated. Most of the differentially expressed genes were involved in bacterial metabolism, such as the phosphotransferase system (PTS), and heat shock proteins. In the case of glucose scarcity, the growth characteristics of tran deletion mutants were impacted significantly, meanwhile Deltatran mutant was highly sensitive to environmental stresses. Moreover, cell adherence decreased by 22.2%, and virulence in zebrafish declined to more than five times in Deltatran mutants. These data demonstrate the role of Tran in regulation in S. suis serotype 2, that is affect bacterial virulence by influencing bacterial metabolism and stress tolerance of external environment.
TI  - Latest developments on Streptococcus suis: an emerging zoonotic pathogen: part 1.
AB  - First International Workshop on Streptococcus suis, Beijing, China, 12-13 August  2013 The first international workshop on Streptococcus suis, which is an important swine pathogen and emerging zoonotic agent, took place in Beijing, jointly organized by the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Montreal, Canada and the National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC. The aim of the meeting was to gather together, for the first time, more than 80 researchers working on S. suis, from countries including China, Canada, Japan, The Netherlands, Germany, Thailand, the UK and Vietnam. This article, the first of a two-part report on this First International Workshop, reviews current aspects of the epidemiology and population genomics of S. suis, covers public health concerns and discusses questions about S. suis serotyping and molecular diagnostics.
TI  - Colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip test compromising optimised combinations of anti-S. suis capsular polysaccharide polyclonal antibodies for detection of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - A rapid diagnosis kit that detects Streptococcus suis (S. suis) antigens from urine with an immunochromatographic stripe (ICS) test was developed in this study. The ICS test was produced using colloidal gold coated with polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) against S. suis. The pAbs were developed from rabbits immunised with S. suis serotype 2 capsular polysaccharides (CPS). Development of the pAbs was investigated to establish their binding to CPS and to determine the maximum sensitivity of two combination antibodies for the ICS test. The results of the ICS optimisation revealed that the combinations of pAb C-N1 and pAb C-N2 had the highest sensitivity to CPS. The minimum limitation of ICS sensitivity indicated 1.0 x 10(4) colony forming units (CFU) and a CPS concentration of 0.05 microg. The assay time for detection of S. suis antigens is less than 15 min, which is suitable for rapid detection. A cross-reactive test was also conducted, and it detected no other bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae). The cross-reactivity of other serotypes in S. suis was also investigated, and tests for serotypes of 1, 1/2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, and 16 were positive. This study presents the first report of a development of an ICS that enables the quantitative detection of streptococcal antigens. The S. suis ICS provides several advantages over other methods, including the speed and simplicity of use.
TI  - [Expression, purification and hIgG-binding activity identification of truncated Streptococcus suis factor H-binding protein].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To construct a prokaryotic expression vector of the His-tagged truncated factor H-binding protein (Fhb) fragments, Fhb-N (amino acids 45-344aa) and Fhb-C (amino acids 345-644aa), of Streptococcus suis serotype 2, express it in E.coli BL21 (DE3) in order to acquire high-purity recombinant protein, and finally identify the binding activity with human serum IgG (hIgG). METHODS: Fhb-N gene and Fhb-C gene were amplified using the primers designed according to 05ZYH33 genome sequences and cloned into the expression vector pET28a(+) to construct recombinant plasmids. The plasmids were transformed into E.coli BL21 (DE3) and induced to express by IPTG. The recombinant proteins were purified by nickel affinity chromatography and identified by Western blotting. The hIgG was purified from human serum by HiTrap protein G HP column in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. In addition, the specific binding to hIgG was identified by Western blotting and biolayer Interferometry (BLI). RESULTS: The prokaryotic expression vector of His-Fhb-N and His-Fhb-C was constructed, and the target proteins were expressed, purified and identified. The specific binding activity with hIgG was identified and the binding region was found located on the Fhb-N(45-344aa). CONCLUSION: His-Fhb-N can specifically bind to hIgG, which will help us to further study the role of Fhb-hIgG interaction in the pathogenesis of Streptococcus suis.
TI  - The Streptococcus suis transcriptional landscape reveals adaptation mechanisms in pig blood and cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - Streptococcus suis (SS) is an important pathogen of pigs, and it is also recognized as a zoonotic agent for humans. SS infection may result in septicemia or meningitis in the host. However, little is known about genes that contribute to the virulence process and survival within host blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Small RNAs (sRNA) have emerged as key regulators of virulence in several bacteria, but they have not been investigated in SS. Here, using a differential RNA-sequencing approach and RNAs from SS strain P1/7 grown in rich medium, pig blood, or CSF, we present the SS genome-wide map of 793 transcriptional start sites and 370 operons. In addition to identifying 29 sRNAs, we show that five sRNA deletion mutants attenuate SS virulence in a zebrafish infection model. Homology searches revealed that 10 sRNAs were predicted to be present in other pathogenic Streptococcus species. Compared with wild-type strain P1/7, sRNAs rss03, rss05, and rss06 deletion mutants were significantly more sensitive to killing by pig blood. It is possible that rss06 contributes to SS virulence by indirectly activating expression of SSU0308, a virulence gene encoding a zinc-binding lipoprotein. In blood, genes involved in the synthesis of capsular polysaccharide (CPS) and subversion of host defenses were up-regulated. In contrast, in CSF, genes for CPS synthesis were down-regulated. Our study is the first analysis of SS sRNAs involved in virulence and has both improved our understanding of SS pathogenesis and increased the number of sRNAs known to play definitive roles in bacterial virulence.
TI  - Correlation between PFGE Groups and mrp/epf/sly Genotypes of Human Streptococcus  suis Serotype 2 in Northern Thailand.
AB  - Streptococcus suis infection is a severe zoonotic disease commonly found in Northern Thailand where people often consume raw pork and/or pig's blood. The most frequent clinical presentations are meningitis, sepsis, and endocarditis with higher rate of mortality and hearing loss sequelae. To clarify the correlation between pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) groups and mrp/epf/sly genotypes of S. suis serotype 2, 62 patient and 4 healthy pig isolates from Northern Thailand were studied. By PFGE analysis, at 66% homology, most human isolates (69.4%) and 1 pig isolate were in group A, whereas 14.5% of human isolates and 3 out of 4 pig isolates were in group D. According to mrp/epf/sly genotypes, 80.6% of human isolates were identified in mrp (+) epf (-) sly (-) and only 12.9% were in mrp (-) epf (-) sly (+) genotypes; in contrast, 1 and 3 pig isolates were detected in these two genotypes, respectively. Interestingly, all isolates of S. suis serotype 2 classified in PFGE groups A, B, and E were set in mrp (+) epf (-) sly (-) genotypes. These data show a close correlation between PFGE groups and mrp/epf/sly genotypes of human S. suis serotype 2.
TI  - Characterisation of Streptococcus suis isolates from wild boars (Sus scrofa).
AB  - Wild boar are widely distributed throughout the Iberian Peninsula and can carry potentially virulent strains of Streptococcus suis. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of S. suis in wild boars from two large geographical regions of Spain. Serotypes 1, 2, 7 and 9 identified were further genetically characterised by virulence-associated genotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) to determine the population structure of S. suis carried by these animals. Streptococcus suis was isolated from 39.1% of the wild boars examined: serotype 9 was the most frequently isolated (12.5%), followed by serotype 1 (2.5%). Serotype 2 was rarely isolated (0.3%). Eighteen additional serotypes were identified indicating wide diversity of this pathogen within the wild boar population. This heterogeneity was confirmed by PFGE and MLST analyses and the majority of isolates exhibited the virulence-associated genotype mrp-/epf-/sly-. The results of this study highlight that the carriage of S. suis by wild boars is commonplace. However, MLST data indicate that these isolates are not related to prevalent clonal complexes ST1, ST16, ST61 and ST87 typically associated with infection of pigs or humans in Europe.
TI  - Streptococcus suis-related prosthetic joint infection and streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome in a pig farmer in the United States.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an emerging swine-associated zoonotic agent that can cause  meningitis and septicemia in humans. We present, to our knowledge, the first case of S. suis arthroplasty infection and streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome due to an nonencapsulated serotype 5 strain in North America.
TI  - Transcriptional approach to study porcine tracheal epithelial cells individually  or dually infected with swine influenza virus and Streptococcus suis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Swine influenza is a highly contagious viral infection in pigs affecting the respiratory tract that can have significant economic impacts. Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is one of the most important post-weaning bacterial pathogens in swine causing different infections, including pneumonia. Both pathogens are important contributors to the porcine respiratory disease complex. Outbreaks of swine influenza virus with a significant level of co-infections due to S. suis have lately been reported. In order to analyze, for the first time, the transcriptional host response of swine tracheal epithelial (NPTr) cells to H1N1 swine influenza virus (swH1N1) infection, S. suis serotype 2 infection and a dual infection, we carried out a comprehensive gene expression profiling using a microarray approach. RESULTS: Gene clustering showed that the swH1N1 and swH1N1/S. suis infections modified the expression of genes in a similar manner. Additionally, infection of NPTr cells by S. suis alone resulted in fewer differentially expressed genes compared to mock-infected cells. However, some important genes coding for inflammatory mediators such as chemokines, interleukins, cell adhesion molecules, and eicosanoids were significantly upregulated in the presence of both pathogens compared to infection with each pathogen individually. This synergy may be the consequence, at least in part, of an increased bacterial adhesion/invasion of epithelial cells previously infected by swH1N1, as recently reported. CONCLUSION: Influenza virus would replicate in the respiratory epithelium and induce an inflammatory infiltrate comprised of mononuclear cells and neutrophils. In a co-infection situation, although these cells would be unable to phagocyte and kill S. suis, they are highly activated by this pathogen. S. suis is not considered a primary pulmonary pathogen, but an exacerbated production of proinflammatory mediators during a co-infection with influenza virus may be important in the pathogenesis and clinical outcome of S. suis-induced respiratory diseases.
TI  - Streptococcus suis serotyping by a new multiplex PCR.
AB  - A multiplex PCR was developed to detect all true serotypes of Streptococcus suis. This multiplex PCR was composed of four reaction sets. The first set identified nine serotypes (serotypes 1/2, 1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 11, 14 and 16), the second set identified eight serotypes (serotypes 4, 5, 8, 12, 18, 19, 24 and 25), the third set identified seven serotypes (serotypes 6, 10, 13, 15, 17, 23 and 31), and the last set identified five serotypes (serotypes 21, 27, 28, 29 and 30). This assay correctly detected serotypes 2, 5, 14 and 24 in human isolates, and serotypes 1, 2, 1/2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 24, 28 and 31 in pig isolates from Thailand. No cross-reaction was observed with other bacterial species. Our multiplex PCR was able to simultaneously amplify a DNA mixture of reference Streptococcus suis serotypes. This assay should be useful for serotype surveillance of human and pig isolates of Streptococcus suis.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of Streptococcus suis isolated from clinically healthy swine in Brazil.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important pathogen in the swine industry. This study is  the first to report on the antimicrobial susceptibility of S. suis isolated from clinically healthy pigs in Brazil; the fourth major pork producer in the world. The antimicrobial susceptibility of 260 strains was determined by disc diffusion method. Strains were commonly susceptible to ceftiofur, cephalexin, chloramphenicol, and florfenicol, with more than 80% of the strains being susceptible to these antimicrobials. A high frequency of resistance to some of the antimicrobial agents was demonstrated, with resistance being most common to sulfa-trimethoprim (100%), tetracycline (97.69%), clindamycin (84.61%), norfloxacin (76.92%), and ciprofloxacin (61.15%). A high percentage of multidrug resistant strains (99.61%) were also found. The results of this study indicate that ceftiofur, cephalexin, and florfenicol are the antimicrobials of choice for empirical control of the infections caused by S. suis.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of Escherichia coli F4, Pasteurella multocida, and Streptococcus suis isolates from a diagnostic veterinary laboratory and recommendations for a surveillance system.
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility data on Escherichia coli F4, Pasteurella multocida,  and Streptococcus suis isolates from Ontario swine (January 1998 to October 2010) were acquired from a comprehensive diagnostic veterinary laboratory in Ontario, Canada. In relation to the possible development of a surveillance system for antimicrobial resistance, data were assessed for ease of management, completeness, consistency, and applicability for temporal and spatial statistical analyses. Limited farm location data precluded spatial analyses and missing demographic data limited their use as predictors within multivariable statistical models. Changes in the standard panel of antimicrobials used for susceptibility testing reduced the number of antimicrobials available for temporal analyses. Data consistency and quality could improve over time in this and similar diagnostic laboratory settings by encouraging complete reporting with sample submission and by modifying database systems to limit free-text data entry. These changes could make more statistical methods available for disease surveillance and cluster detection.
TI  - Role of capsule and suilysin in mucosal infection of complement-deficient mice with Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Virulent Streptococcus suis serotype 2 strains are invasive extracellular bacteria causing septicemia and meningitis in piglets and humans. One objective of this study was to elucidate the function of complement in innate immune defense against S. suis. Experimental infection of wild-type (WT) and C3(-/-) mice demonstrated for the first time that the complement system protects naive mice against invasive mucosal S. suis infection. S. suis WT but not an unencapsulated mutant caused mortality associated with meningitis and other pathologies in C3(-/-) mice. The capsule contributed also substantially to colonization of the upper respiratory tract. Experimental infection of C3(-/-) mice with a suilysin mutant indicated that suilysin expression facilitated an early disease onset and the pathogenesis of meningitis. Flow cytometric analysis revealed C3 antigen deposition on the surface of ca. 40% of S. suis WT bacteria after opsonization with naive WT mouse serum, although to a significantly lower intensity than on the unencapsulated mutant. Ex vivo multiplication in murine WT and C3(-/-) blood depended on capsule but not suilysin expression. Interestingly, S. suis invasion of inner organs was also detectable in C5aR(-/-) mice, suggesting that chemotaxis and activation of immune cells via the anaphylatoxin receptor C5aR is, in addition to opsonization, a further important function of the complement system in defense against mucosal S. suis infection. In conclusion, we unequivocally demonstrate here the importance of complement against mucosal S. suis serotype 2 infection and that the capsule of this pathogen is also involved in escape from complement-independent immunity.
TI  - Functional analysis of c-di-AMP phosphodiesterase, GdpP, in Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is an important zoonotic pathogen that causes serious diseases in pigs and humans. GdpP protein is a recently discovered specific phosphodiesterase that degrades cyclic diadenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP). It is widely distributed among the firmicutes phylum and altered expression of GdpP is associated with several phenotypes in various bacterial strains. We investigated the role of GdpP in physiology and virulence in SS2. An in-frame mutant of gdpP was constructed using homologous recombination and bacterial growth, biofilm formation, hemolytic activity, cell adherence and invasion, expression of virulence factors, and virulence were evaluated. Disruption of gdpP increased intracellular c-di-AMP level and affected growth and increased biofilm formation of SS2. Simultaneously, the gdpP mutant strain exhibited a significant decrease in hemolytic activity and adherence to and invasion of HEp-2 cells compared with the parental strain. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction indicated significantly reduced expression of the known virulence genes cps2, sly, fpbs, mrp, ef and gdh in the gdpP mutant. In murine infection models, the gdpP mutant strain was attenuated, and impaired bacterial growth was observed in specific organs. All these findings revealed a significant contribution of gdpP and its substrate (c-di-AMP) to the biology and virulence of SS2.
TI  - The CcpA regulon of Streptococcus suis reveals novel insights into the regulation of the streptococcal central carbon metabolism by binding of CcpA to two distinct binding motifs.
AB  - Streptococcus suis (S. suis) is a neglected zoonotic streptococcus causing fatal  diseases in humans and in pigs. The transcriptional regulator CcpA (catabolite control protein A) is involved in the metabolic adaptation to different carbohydrate sources and virulence of S. suis and other pathogenic streptococci. In this study, we determined the DNA binding characteristics of CcpA and identified the CcpA regulon during growth of S. suis. Electrophoretic mobility shift analyses showed promiscuous DNA binding of CcpA to cognate cre sites in vitro. In contrast, sequencing of immunoprecipitated chromatin revealed two specific consensus motifs, a pseudo-palindromic cre motif (WWGAAARCGYTTTCWW) and a novel cre2 motif (TTTTYHWDHHWWTTTY), within the regulatory elements of the genes directly controlled by CcpA. Via these elements CcpA regulates expression of genes involved in carbohydrate uptake and conversion, and in addition in important metabolic pathways of the central carbon metabolism, like glycolysis, mixed-acid fermentation, and the fragmentary TCA cycle. Furthermore, our analyses provide evidence that CcpA regulates the genes of the central carbon metabolism by binding either the pseudo-palindromic cre motif or the cre2 motif in a HPr(Ser) approximately P independent conformation.
TI  - Streptococcus suis type 2 SSU0587 protein is a beta-galactosidase that contributes to bacterial adhesion but not to virulence in mice.
AB  - Bacterial surface proteins play key roles in virulence and often contribute to bacterial adhesion and invasion. We discovered that the Streptococcus suis type 2 (SS2) gene SSU0587 encodes a protein of 1,491 amino acids that possesses beta-galactosidase activity. The surface association of the protein was dependent upon sortase activity. Deleting SSU0587 from clinical SS2 isolate JX081101 caused a loss of both beta-galactosidase activity and adherence to microvascular endothelial cells. Deleting SSU0587 had no measurable impact on either invasion of microvascular endothelial cells or on virulence in a murine infection model, although the concentration of JX081101DeltaSSU0587 was reduced in the brains of infected mice, as compared with the pathogen loads of the wild-type strain.
TI  - Streptococcus suis infection: an emerging/reemerging challenge of bacterial infectious diseases?
AB  - Streptococcus suis (S. suis) is a family of pathogenic gram-positive bacterial strains that represents a primary health problem in the swine industry worldwide. S. suis is also an emerging zoonotic pathogen that causes severe human infections clinically featuring with varied diseases/syndromes (such as meningitis, septicemia, and arthritis). Over the past few decades, continued efforts have made significant progress toward better understanding this zoonotic infectious entity, contributing in part to the elucidation of the molecular mechanism underlying its high pathogenicity. This review is aimed at presenting an updated overview of this pathogen from the perspective of molecular epidemiology, clinical diagnosis and typing, virulence mechanism, and protective antigens contributing to its zoonosis.
TI  - A functional peptidoglycan hydrolase characterized from T4SS in 89K pathogenicity island of epidemic Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S. suis 2) has evolved efficient mechanisms to cause streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS), which is a new emerging infectious disease linked to S. suis. We have previously reported that a type IV secretion system (T4SS) harbored by the specific 89K pathogenicity island (PAI) of S. suis 2 contributes to the development of STSS and mediates horizontal transfer of 89K. However, the 89K T4SS machinery assembly in vivo and in vitro is poorly understood, and the component acting directly to digest the bacterial cell wall needs to be identified. RESULTS: The virB1-89K gene product encoded in the 89K PAI is the only one that shows similarity to the Agrobacterium VirB1 component and contains a conserved CHAP domain that may function in peptidoglycan hydrolysis, which makes it a plausible candidate acting as a hydrolase against the peptidoglycan cell wall to allow the assembly of the T4SS apparatus. In the current study, the CHAP domain of VirB1-89K from S. suis 89K PAI was cloned and over-expressed in Escherichia coli, and its peptidoglycan-degrading activity in vitro was determined. The results indicated that the VirB1-89K CHAP domain can degrade the peptidoglycan layer of bacteria. Deletion of virB1-89K reduces significantly, but does not abolish, the virulence of S. suis in a mouse model. CONCLUSIONS: The experimental results presented here suggested that VirB1-89K facilitates the assembly of 89K T4SS apparatus by catalyzing the degradation of the peptidoglycan cell wall, thus contributing to the pathogenesis of S. suis 2 infection.
TI  - Capsule loss or death: the position of mutations among capsule genes sways the destiny of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis, an emerging zoonotic pathogen, is responsible for various diseases in swine and humans. Most S. suis strains from clinical cases possess a group of capsular polysaccharide synthesis (cps) genes and phenotypically express capsular polysaccharides (CPs). Although CPs are considered to be an important virulence factor, our previous study showed that many S. suis isolates from porcine endocarditis lost their CPs, and some of these unencapsulated isolates had large insertions or deletions in the cps gene clusters. We further investigated 25 endocarditis isolates with no obvious genetic alterations to elucidate the unencapsulation mechanisms and found that a single-nucleotide substitution and frameshift mutation in two glycosyltransferase genes (cps2E and cps2F) were the main causes of the capsule loss. Moreover, mutations in the genes involved in side-chain formation (cps2J and cps2N), polymerase (cps2I), and flippase (cps2O) appeared to be lethal; however, these lethal effects were relieved by mutations in the cps2EF region. As unencapsulation and even the death of individual cells have recently been suggested to be beneficial to the pathogenesis of infections, the results of the present study provide a further insight into understanding the biological significance of cps mutations during the course of S. suis infections.
TI  - Carbohydrate availability regulates virulence gene expression in Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is a major bacterial pathogen of young pigs causing worldwide  economic problems for the pig industry. S. suis is also an emerging pathogen of humans. Colonization of porcine oropharynx by S. suis is considered to be a high risk factor for invasive disease. In the oropharyngeal cavity, where glucose is rapidly absorbed but dietary alpha-glucans persist, there is a profound effect of carbohydrate availability on the expression of virulence genes. Nineteen predicted or confirmed S. suis virulence genes that promote adhesion to and invasion of epithelial cells were expressed at higher levels when S. suis was supplied with the alpha-glucan starch/pullulan compared to glucose as the single carbon source. Additionally the production of suilysin, a toxin that damages epithelial cells, was increased more than ten-fold when glucose levels were low and S. suis was growing on pullulan. Based on biochemical, bioinformatics and in vitro and in vivo gene expression studies, we developed a biological model that postulates the effect of carbon catabolite repression on expression of virulence genes in the mucosa, organs and blood. This research increases our understanding of S. suis virulence mechanisms and has important implications for the design of future control strategies including the development of anti-infective strategies by modulating animal feed composition.
TI  - Contribution of eukaryotic-type serine/threonine kinase to stress response and virulence of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is an important swine and human pathogen responsible for septicemia and meningitis. The bacterial homologues of eukaryotic-type serine/threonine kinases (ESTKs) have been reported to play critical roles in various cellular processes. To investigate the role of STK in SS2, an isogenic stk mutant strain (Deltastk) and a complemented strain (CDeltastk) were constructed. The Deltastk showed a significant decrease in adherence to HEp-2 cells, compared with the wild-type strain, and a reduced survival ratio in whole blood. In addition, the Deltastk exhibited a notable reduced tolerance of environmental stresses including high temperature, acidic pH, oxidative stress, and high osmolarity. More importantly, the Deltastk was attenuated in both the CD1 mouse and piglet models of infection. The results of quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis indicated that the expressions of a few genes involving in adherence, stress response and virulence were clearly decreased in the Deltastk mutant strain. Our data suggest that SsSTK is required for virulence and stress response in SS2.
TI  - Detection of Streptococcus suis in bioaerosols of swine confinement buildings.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important swine pathogen that can cause septicemia, meningitis, and pneumonia. Also recognized as an emerging zoonotic agent, it is responsible for outbreaks of human infections in Asian countries. Serotype 2 is the predominant isolate from diseased animals and humans. The aerosolization of S. suis in the air of swine confinement buildings (SCB) was studied. The presence of S. suis in bioaerosols was monitored in SCB where cases of infection had been reported and in healthy SCB without reported infections. Using a quantitative-PCR (qPCR) method, we determined the total number of bacteria (1 x 10(8) to 2 x 10(8) airborne/m(3)), total number of S. suis bacteria (4 x 10(5) to 10 x 10(5) airborne/m(3)), and number of S. suis serotype 2 and 1/2 bacteria (1 x 10(3) to 30 x 10(3) airborne/m(3)) present in the air. S. suis serotypes 2 and 1/2 were detected in the air of all growing/finishing SCB that had documented cases of S. suis infection and in 50% of healthy SCB. The total number of bacteria and total numbers of S. suis and S. suis serotype 2 and 1/2 bacteria were monitored in one positive SCB during a 5-week period, and it was shown that the aerosolized S. suis serotypes 2 and 1/2 remain airborne for a prolonged period. When the effect of aerosolization on S. suis was observed, the percentage of intact S. suis bacteria (showing cell membrane integrity) in the air might have been up to 13%. Finally S. suis was found in nasal swabs from 14 out of 21 healthy finishing-SCB workers, suggesting significant exposure to the pathogen. This report provides a better understanding of the aerosolization, prevalence, and persistence of S. suis in SCB.
TI  - Virulence genes and genetic diversity of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 isolates from Thailand.
AB  - Isolates of Streptococcus suis from different Western countries as well as those  from China and Vietnam have been previously well characterized. So far, the genetic characteristics and relationship between S. suis strains isolated from both humans and pigs in Thailand are unknown. In this study, a total of 245 S. suis isolates were collected from both human cases (epidemic and sporadic) and pigs (diseased and asymptomatic) in Thailand. Bacterial strains were identified by biochemical tests and PCR targeting both, the 16S rRNA and gdh genes. Thirty-six isolates were identified as serotype 2 based on serotyping and the cps2-PCR. These isolates were tested for the presence of six virulence-associated genes: an arginine deiminase (arcA), a 38-kDa protein and protective antigen (bay046), an extracellular factor (epf), an hyaluronidase (hyl), a muramidase-released protein (mrp) and a suilysin (sly). In addition, the genetic diversities of these isolates were studied by RAPD PCR and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis. Four virulence-associated gene patterns (VAGP 1 to 4) were obtained, and the majority of isolates (32/36) carried all genes tested (VAGP1). Each of the three OPB primers used provided 4 patterns designated RAPD-A to RAPD-D. Furthermore, MLST analysis could also distinguish the 36 isolates into four sequence types (STs): ST1 (n = 32), ST104 (n = 2), ST233 (n = 1) and a newly identified ST, ST336 (n = 1). Dendrogram constructions based on RAPD patterns indicated that S. suis serotype 2 isolates from Thailand could be divided into four groups and that the characteristics of the individual groups were in complete agreement with the virulence gene profiles and STs. The majority (32/36) of isolates recovered from diseased pigs, slaughterhouse pigs or human patients could be classified into a single group (VAGP1, RAPD-A and ST1). This genetic information strongly suggests the transmission of S. suis isolates from pigs to humans in Thailand. Our findings are the first to report genetic characteristics of strains from Thailand and to elucidate the genetic relationship among S. suis isolates from human and pig origins.
TI  - Development of a two-step multiplex PCR assay for typing of capsular polysaccharide synthesis gene clusters of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - We developed a practical and easy two-step multiplex PCR assay to aid in serotyping of Streptococcus suis. The assay accurately typed almost all of the serotype reference strains and field isolates of various serotypes and also identified the genotypes of capsular polysaccharide synthesis gene clusters of some serologically nontypeable strains.
TI  - Atypical Streptococcus suis in man, Argentina, 2013.
AB  
TI  - Septic arthritis caused by Streptococcus suis serotype 5 in pig farmer.
AB  
TI  - The beta-galactosidase (BgaC) of the zoonotic pathogen Streptococcus suis is a surface protein without the involvement of bacterial virulence.
AB  - Streptococcal pathogens have evolved to express exoglycosidases, one of which is  BgaC beta-galactosidase, to deglycosidate host surface glycolconjucates with exposure of the polysaccharide receptor for bacterial adherence. The paradigm BgaC protein is the bgaC product of Streptococcus, a bacterial surface-exposed beta-galactosidase. Here we report the functional definition of the BgaC homologue from an epidemic Chinese strain 05ZYH33 of the zoonotic pathogen Streptococcus suis. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that S. suis BgaC shared the conserved active sites (W240, W243 and Y454). The recombinant BgaC protein of S. suis was purified to homogeneity. Enzymatic assays confirmed its activity of beta-galactosidase. Also, the hydrolysis activity was found to be region-specific and sugar-specific for the Gal beta-1,3-GlcNAc moiety of oligosaccharides. Flow cytometry analyses combined with immune electron microscopy demonstrated that S. suis BgaC is an atypical surface-anchored protein in that it lacks the "LPXTG" motif for typical surface proteins. Integrative evidence from cell lines and mice-based experiments showed that an inactivation of bgaC does not significantly impair the ability of neither adherence nor anti-phagocytosis, and consequently failed to attenuate bacterial virulence, which is somewhat similar to the scenario seen with S. pneumoniae. Therefore we concluded that S. suis BgaC is an atypical surface-exposed protein without the involvement of bacterial virulence.
TI  - Synthesis of multi-fullerenes encapsulated palladium nanocage, and its application in electrochemiluminescence immunosensors for the detection of Streptococcus suis Serotype 2.
AB  - A novel functionalized material is synthesized using surface-decorated fullerene  (C60) to encapsulate hollow and porous palladium nanocages (PdNCs), and is applied to fabricate an electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunosensor for the detection of Streptococcus suis Serotype 2 (SS2). PdNCs with hollow interiors and porous walls are prepared using a galvanic replacement reaction between silver nanocubes and metal precursor salts. Then, C60 reacts with L-cysteine (L-Cys) to form L-Cys functionalized C60 (C60-L-Cys), which has a better biocompatibility, conductivity, and hydrophilicity compared to C60 and possesses abundant -SH groups on the surface. Because of the special interaction between -SH and PdNCs, the obtained C60-L-Cys is adsorbed around the PdNCs to form an interesting structure with multiple spheres encapsulating the cage. The resultant functionalized material (C60 -L-Cys-PdNCs) has a high specific surface area, good electrocatalytic ability, and efficient photocatalytic activity, and is used to construct an ECL immunosensor for the detection of SS2. The ECL signal amplified strategy is performed by using the novel coreactant (C60-L-Cys) and in situ generation of O2 thus creating the S2O8(2-)-O2 ECL system. As a result, a wide linear detection range of 0.1 pg mL(-1) to 100 ng mL(-1) is acquired with a relatively low detection limit of 33.3 fg mL(-1).
TI  - Deregulated balance of omega-6 and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids following  infection by the zoonotic pathogen Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important swine pathogen and an emergent zoonotic pathogen. Excessive inflammation caused by S. suis is responsible for early high mortality in septic shock-like syndrome cases. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may contribute to regulating inflammatory processes. This study shows that mouse infection by S. suis is accompanied by an increase of arachidonic acid, a proinflammatory omega-6 (omega-6) PUFA, and by a decrease of docosahexaenoic acid, an anti-inflammatory omega-3 PUFA. Macrophages infected with S. suis showed activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways and cyclooxygenase-2 upregulation. Fenretinide, a synthetic vitamin A analog, reduced in vitro expression of inflammatory mediators. Pretreatment of mice with fenretinide significantly improved their survival by reducing systemic proinflammatory cytokines during the acute phase of an S. suis infection. These findings indicate a beneficial effect of fenretinide in diminishing the expression of inflammation and improving survival during an acute infection by a virulent S. suis strain.
TI  - The protective protein Sao (surface antigen one) is not a critical virulence factor for Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Surface antigen one (Sao) is protein that was shown to protect pigs in vaccination trials against disease caused by Streptococcus suis. Here, we used an isogenic Deltasao mutant to investigate the insofar unknown role of Sao in S. suis virulence. The Deltasao mutant and its wild-type parent strain (sequence type 1, European strain) did not present significant differences on levels of adhesion/invasion of swine respiratory epithelial cells. Moreover, the Deltasao mutant resisted phagocytosis by macrophages similarly to the parent strain and it was still virulent in a mouse model of infection. Our findings suggest a minor role of Sao in S. suis serotype 2 virulence.
TI  - High-level expression, purification and characterisation of porcine beta-defensin 2 in Pichia pastoris and its potential as a cost-efficient growth promoter in porcine feed.
AB  - Porcine beta-defensin 2 (pBD2), a recently discovered porcine defensin that is produced by the intestine, exerts antimicrobial activities and innate immune effects that are linked to intestinal diseases in pigs. Here, we report a codon-optimised protein corresponding to mature pBD2 cDNA that was expressed and purified in Pichia pastoris yeast. The highest amount of secreted protein (3,694.0 mg/L) was reached 144 h into a 150-h induction during high-density cultivation. Precipitation followed by gel exclusion chromatography yielded 383.7 mg/L purified recombinant pBD2 (rpBD2) with a purity of ~93.7 %. Two recombinant proteins of 5,458.5 and 5,258.4 Da were detected in the mass spectrum due to variation in the amino-terminus. The rpBD2 exhibited high antimicrobial activity against a broad range of pig pathogenic bacteria (minimal inhibitory concentration [MIC] 32-128 mug/mL); the highest activity was observed against Salmonella choleraesuis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus suis (MIC 32-64 mug/mL). However, rpBD2 also inhibited the growth of probiotics such as Lactobacillus plantarum, Bacillus subtilis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but at lower efficacies than the pathogens. Purified or unpurified rpBD2 also maintained high activity over a wide range of pH values (2.0-10.0), a high thermal stability at 100 degrees C for 40 min and significant resistance to papain, pepsin and trypsin. In addition, the activity of rpBD2 towards S. aureus was unaffected by 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 20 % dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO). Our results suggest that pBD2 could be produced efficiently in large quantities in P. pastoris and be a substitute for traditional antibiotics for growth promotion in the porcine industry.
TI  - Comparative genomic hybridization identifies virulence differences in Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important zoonotic pathogen. However, identification of  virulent S. suis strains is complicated because of the high diversity of the species. Here we evaluated the genetic difference among S. suis strains using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and virulence variation in vivo and in vitro. We showed that different clades differed in their ability to activate TLR2/6 in vitro and their capacity to induce cytokine production in vivo as well as their resistance to phagocytosis and survival in vivo. Our data showed the S. suis strains tested can be classified into three groups having differing levels of virulence: epidemic and highly virulent strains were clustered into clade Ia (epidemic and highly virulent group, E/HV group), virulent strains were clustered into clade Ib (virulent group, V group), and intermediately or weakly virulent strains were clustered into other clades (intermediately or weakly virulent group, I/WV group). Our study provided further insight into the genomic and virulence variation of S. suis.
TI  - Adhesion of bacterial pathogens to soil colloidal particles: influences of cell type, natural organic matter, and solution chemistry.
AB  - Bacterial adhesion to granular soil particles is well studied; however, pathogen  interactions with naturally occurring colloidal particles (<2 mum) in soil has not been investigated. This study was developed to identify the interaction mechanisms between model bacterial pathogens and soil colloids as a function of cell type, natural organic matter (NOM), and solution chemistry. Specifically, batch adhesion experiments were conducted using NOM-present, NOM-stripped soil colloids, Streptococcus suis SC05 and Escherichia coli WH09 over a wide range of solution pH (4.0-9.0) and ionic strength (IS, 1-100 mM KCl). Cell characterization techniques, Freundlich isotherm, and Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory (sphere-sphere model) were utilized to quantitatively determine the interactions between cells and colloids. The adhesion coefficients (Kf) of S. suis SC05 to NOM-present and NOM-stripped soil colloids were significantly higher than E. coli WH09, respectively. Similarly, Kf values of S. suis SC05 and E. coli WH09 adhesion to NOM-stripped soil colloids were greater than those colloids with NOM-present, respectively, suggesting NOM inhibits bacterial adhesion. Cell adhesion to soil colloids declined with increasing pH and enhanced with rising IS (1-50 mM). Interaction energy calculations indicate these adhesion trends can be explained by DLVO-type forces, with S. suis SC05 and E. coli WH09 being weakly adhered in shallow secondary energy minima via polymer bridging and charge heterogeneity. S. suis SC05 adhesion decreased at higher IS 100 mM, which is attributed to the change of hydrophobic effect and steric repulsion resulted from the greater presence of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) on S. suis SC05 surface as compared to E. coli WH09. Hence, pathogen adhesion to the colloidal material is determined by a combination of DLVO, charge heterogeneity, hydrophobic and polymer interactions as a function of solution chemistry.
TI  - Characterization and proteome analysis of inosine 5-monophosphate dehydrogenase in epidemic Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is an important zoonotic pathogen that causes severe disease symptoms in pigs and humans. In the present study, we found one isogenic mutant lacking inosine 5-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) DeltaZY05719 was attenuated in pigs compared with the wild-type SS2 strain ZY05719. Comparative proteome analysis of the secreted proteins expression profiles between ZY05719 and DeltaZY05719 allowed us to identify Triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) and glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), which were down expressed in the absence of the IMPDH. Both of them are glycolytic enzymes participating in the glycolytic pathway. Compared with ZY05719, DeltaZY05719 lost the ability of utilize mannose, which might relate to down expression of TPI and GAPDH. In addition, GAPDH is a well-known factor that involved in adhesion to host cells, and we demonstrated ability of adhesion to HEp-2 and PK15 by DeltaZY05719 was significantly weakened, in contrast to ZY05719. The adhesion to host cells is the crucial step to cause infection for pathogen, and the reduction adhesion of DeltaZY05719, to some extent illustrates the attenuated virulence of DeltaZY05719.
TI  - Streptococcus suis adenosine synthase functions as an effector in evasion of PMN-mediated innate immunit.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S. suis 2) is a highly invasive pathogen in pigs and humans that can cause severe systemic infection. Sepsis and meningitis are the most common clinical manifestations of S. suis 2 infection. However, the mechanisms of S. suis 2 surviving in human blood remains unclear, so to identify novel virulence factors in evasion of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN)-mediated innate immunity play important roles in developing therapies against S. suis 2 infection. Here, we found that S. suis 2 can escape phagocytic clearance by adenosine synthesis in blood. Through bioinformatics-based analyses we identified a cell wall-anchored protein harbors a 5'-nucleotidase signature sequence and evidence strongly indicated that it can convert adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to adenosine. It was designated as Ssads (the adenosine synthase of S. suis 2). Furthermore, we found that Ssads could impair PMN's defense against S. suis 2 with decreasing of oxidative activity and degranulation of PMNs in human blood via A(2)a receptors. Additionally, this enzyme-de fi cient mutant was found to have diminished virulence in the piglet infection model. Taken together, these results indicate that Ssads play an important role in S. suis 2 escaping human innate immunity in the context of inhibiting PMN's activity by synthesis of adenosine.
TI  - Microbiological identification and analysis of Swine lungs collected from carcasses in Swine farms, china.
AB  - The primary objective of this 3 years study was to determine the prevalence of porcine pathogens of the lungs of swine in swine farms in southern China. A total of 5,420 samples were collected from 200 swine farms. The bacterium that was most commonly isolated was Streptococcus suis, with 10.24 % of the samples being positive, 114 lungs (2.1 %) were positive for pseudorabies virus and 263 (4.85 %) were positive for classical swine fever virus; much lower than positive for PRRSV (15.1 %, p = 0.023) and PCV2 (13.8 %, p = 0.038). lungs that were positive for PRRSV and/or PCV-2 have significantly increased odds of being positive for any of the S. suis (9.79 vs. 0.44 %, p = 0.003).
TI  - [Analysis of pathogen spectrum of Encephalitis/Meningitis in northwestern area of China].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To learn the characteristics of pathogen spectrum of Encephalitis /Meningitis in northwestern area of China. METHODS: Between January 1st 2009 and March 31st 2011, a total of 569 patients with clinical symptoms of Encephalitis/Meningitis were selected from the hospitals in Gansu, Qinghai,Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang province. 1514 samples of specimen were collected from the 515 patients, to detect the IgM of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), enterovirus (EV, including Coxsackie virus, ECHO virus and enterovirus 71), Mumps virus, Herpes simplex virus (HSV) in blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Meanwhile, Neisseria meningitis (Nm), Haemophilus influenzae Type B (Hib), Staphylococcus, Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus Suis, E. Coli and Cryptococci were also identified. The detection results were analyzed by different region, time and age range. RESULTS: Pathogenic bacteria were identified in the specimen from 16 patients, with the rate at 3.65%, of which the dominant ones were Streptococcus pneumonia (7 patients, 43.75%). Virus were identified in the specimen from 132 patients, with the rate at 27.05%, of which the dominant types were EV and HSV, accounting for 33.33% (44 cases) and 31.82% (42 cases) respectively. The detection rate of virus showed a significant seasonal trend, with the peak appearing between June and November each year. The peak of EV detection was between July and September, with 24 cases detected out; the peak of HSV was between June and August (11 cases detected out); mumps virus was mainly found between July and December (25 cases). There was no significant time-distribution found in the detection of bacteria. The EV and HSV were mainly distributed in Gansu and Qinghai province (70 cases) ;most of mumps virus were found in Gansu province (24 cases);and JEV were only found in Gansu province (20 cases). The viral pathogen spectrum was identified in all ages, and the EV and mumps virus were mainly found in children aged 0-14 years old (42 and 17 cases respectively) ; JEV were identified in people over 15 years old, with 13 detected out of the 20 patients. CONCLUSION: The main pathogen of acute encephalitis and meningitis in northwestern area of China was virus, and the main pathogens of encephalitis and meningitis in children under 15 years were Herpes simplex virus and Mumps virus.
TI  - [New insight into bacterial zoonotic pathogens posing health hazards to humans].
AB  - This article presents the problem of evolutionary changes of zoonotic pathogens responsible for human diseases. Everyone is exposed to the risk of zoonotic infection, particularly employees having direct contact with animals, i.e. veterinarians, breeders, butchers and workers of animal products' processing industry. The article focuses on pathogens monitored by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), which has been collecting statistical data on zoonoses from all European Union countries for 19 years and publishing collected data in annual epidemiological reports. Currently, the most important 11 pathogens responsible for causing human zoonotic diseases are being monitored, of which seven are bacteria: Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium bovis, Brucella spp., Coxiella burnetti and Verotoxin-producing E. coli (VTEC)/Shiga-like toxin producing E. coli (STEC). As particularly important are considered foodborne pathogens. The article also includes new emerging zoonotic bacteria, which are not currently monitored by ECDC but might pose a serious epidemiological problem in a foreseeable future: Streptococcus iniae, S. suis, S. dysgalactiae and staphylococci: Staphylococcus intermedius, S. pseudintermedius. Those species have just crossed the animal-human interspecies barrier. The exact mechanism of this phenomenon remains unknown, it is connected, however, with genetic variability, capability to survive in changing environment. These abilities derive from DNA rearrangement and horizontal gene transfer between bacterial cells. Substantial increase in the number of scientific publications on this subject, observed over the last few years, illustrates the importance of the problem.
TI  - Biofilm formation, host-cell adherence, and virulence genes regulation of Streptococcus suis in response to autoinducer-2 signaling.
AB  - Autoinducer-2 (AI-2) is a universal signal molecule mediating intra- and interspecies communication among bacteria. AI-2 is a byproduct of the LuxS enzyme during the catabolism of S-adenosylhomocysteine and plays critical roles in regulating various behaviors of bacteria. In our previous study, the function of LuxS in AI-2 production was verified in Streptococcus suis (SS). Decreased levels of SS biofilm formation and host-cell adherence as well as the inability to produce AI-2 were observed in SS having a luxS mutant gene. In this study, exogenous addition of a low concentration of AI-2 synthesized in vitro was found to promote biofilm formation and host-cell adherence. However, higher concentrations of AI-2 inhibited SS biofilm formation and host-cell adherence. Real-time PCR results showed that the mRNA level of virulence factors of SS biofilm, gdh, cps2, sly, and mrp increased and ef, fbps, and gapdh decreased with increasing AI-2 concentrations. These findings demonstrated that AI-2 supplemented exogenously acted as a concentration-dependent signaling molecule to regulate SS biofilm formation, host-cell adherence, and transcription levels of many virulence genes.
TI  - Identification of the novel lincosamide resistance gene lnu(E) truncated by ISEnfa5-cfr-ISEnfa5 insertion in Streptococcus suis: de novo synthesis and confirmation of functional activity in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The novel lincosamide resistance gene lnu(E), truncated by insertion of an ISEnfa5-cfr-ISEnfa5 segment, was identified in Streptococcus suis. The gene lnu(E) encodes a 173-amino-acid protein with </=69.4% identity to other lincosamide nucleotidyltransferases. The lnu(E) gene and its promoter region were de novo synthesized, and Staphylococcus aureus RN4220 carrying a shuttle vector with the cloned lnu(E) gene showed a 16-fold increase in the lincomycin MIC. Mass spectrometry experiments demonstrated that Lnu(E) catalyzed the nucleotidylation of lincomycin.
TI  - The two-component system NisK/NisR contributes to the virulence of Streptococcus  suis serotype 2.
AB  - Two-component signal-transduction systems (TCSTSs) may regulate some virulence factors in response to external stimuli, and thus allowing Streptococcus suis serotype 2 to interact with the host, promote survival, and cause disease. Here, a mutant of the NisKR TCSTS had attenuated virulence in vitro, as exemplified by lowered hemolytic activity, reduced adherence to epithelial cells, increased elimination by macrophages, and decreased resistance to killing by neutrophils. Results also showed that this system is important for the ability of S. suis serotype 2 to survive and proliferate in an in vivo mouse model. Thus, the NisKR system plays a significant role in pathogenesis, both in colonization and invasive disease.
TI  - Overexpression of luxS cannot increase autoinducer-2 production, only affect the  growth and biofilm formation in Streptococcus suis.
AB  - LuxS/AI-2 quorum sensing (QS) system involves the production of cell signaling molecules via luxS-based autoinducer-2 (AI-2). LuxS has been reported to plays critical roles in regulating various behaviors of bacteria. AI-2 is a byproduct of the catabolism of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) performed by the LuxS and Pfs enzymes. In our previous study, the function of LuxS in AI-2 production was verified in Streptococcus suis (SS). Decreased levels of SS biofilm formation and host-cell adherence as well as an inability to produce AI-2 were observed in bacteria having a luxS mutant gene. In this study, the level of AI-2 activity exhibits a growth-phase dependence with a maximum in late exponential culture in SS. An SS strain that overexpressed luxS was constructed to comprehensively understand the function of AI-2. Overexpressed luxS was not able to increase the level of pfs expression and produce additional AI-2, and the bacteria were slower growing and produced only slightly more biofilm than the wild type. Thus, AI-2 production is not correlated with luxS transcription. luxS expression is constitutive, but the transcription of pfs is perhaps correlated with AI-2 production in SS.
TI  - Comparative genomic analysis shows that Streptococcus suis meningitis isolate SC070731 contains a unique 105K genomic island.
AB  - Streptococcus suis (SS) is an important swine pathogen worldwide that occasionally causes serious infections in humans. SS infection may result in meningitis in pigs and humans. The pathogenic mechanisms of SS are poorly understood. Here, we provide the complete genome sequence of S. suis serotype 2 (SS2) strain SC070731 isolated from a pig with meningitis. The chromosome is 2,138,568bp in length. There are 1933 predicted protein coding sequences and 96.7% (57/59) of the known virulence-associated genes are present in the genome. Strain SC070731 showed similar virulence with SS2 virulent strains HA9801 and ZY05719, but was more virulent than SS2 virulent strain P1/7 in the zebrafish infection model. Comparative genomic analysis revealed a unique 105K genomic island in strain SC070731 that is absent in seven other sequenced SS2 strains. Further analysis of the 105K genomic island indicated that it contained a complete nisin locus similar to the nisin U locus in S. uberis strain 42, a prophage similar to S. oralis phage PH10 and several antibiotic resistance genes. Several proteins in the 105K genomic island, including nisin and RelBE toxin-antitoxin system, contribute to the bacterial fitness and virulence in other pathogenic bacteria. Further investigation of newly identified gene products, including four putative new virulence-associated surface proteins, will improve our understanding of SS pathogenesis.

TI  - Multiple-class antimicrobial resistance surveillance in swine Escherichia coli F4, Pasteurella multocida and Streptococcus suis isolates from Ontario and the impact of the 2004-2006 Porcine Circovirus type-2 Associated Disease outbreak.
AB  - The objective of this work was to describe trends in multiple-class antimicrobial resistance present in clinical isolates of Escherichia coli F4, Pasteurella multocida and Streptococcus suis from Ontario swine 1998-2010. Temporal changes in multiple-class resistance varied by the pathogens examined; significant yearly changes were apparent for the E. coli and P. multocida data. Although not present in the E. coli data, significant increases in multiple-class resistance within P. multocida isolates occurred from 2003 to 2005, coinciding with the expected increase in antimicrobials used to treat clinical signs of Porcine Circovirus Associated Disease (PCVAD) before it was confirmed. Prospective temporal scan statistics for multiple-class resistance suggest that significant clusters of increased resistance may have been found in the spring of 2004; months before the identification of the PCVAD outbreak in the fall of 2004.
TI  - The contribution of suilysin to the pathogenesis of Streptococcus suis meningitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus suis is an emerging zoonotic pathogen, and causes sepsis and meningitis in humans. Although sequence type (ST) 1 and ST104 strains are capable of causing sepsis, ST1 strains commonly cause meningitis. In this study, we investigated the role of suilysin, a member of cholesterol-dependent cytolysins, in differential pathogenicity between ST1 and ST104 strains. METHODS: The levels of transcription and translation of the sly gene and messenger RNA of both ST strains were compared by means of quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. Survival rates and bacterial densities in brain were compared between mice infected with wild-type and sly-knockout ST1 strain. ST104 infections with or without complementation of suilysin were also assessed. RESULTS: The amounts of suilysin produced by ST1 strains were much higher than those produced by ST104 strains. Lower production of suilysin by ST104 strains were attributed to the attenuated sly gene expression, which seemed to be associated with 2 nucleotide insertions in sly promoter region. Furthermore, suilysin contributed to the higher bacterial density and enhanced inflammation in brain and increased mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Our data may explain why ST1 strains, but not ST104 strains, commonly cause meningitis and also suggest the contribution of suilysin to the pathogenesis of meningitis in humans.
TI  - Restoration of bioactive lantibiotic suicin from a remnant lan locus of pathogenic Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized, posttranslationally modified antimicrobial peptides. Their biosynthesis genes are usually organized in gene clusters, which are mainly found in Gram-positive bacteria, including pathogenic streptococci. Three highly virulent Streptococcus suis serotype 2 strains (98HAH33, 05ZYH33, and SC84) have been shown to contain an 89K pathogenicity island. Here, on these islands, we unveiled and reannotated a putative lantibiotic locus designated sui which contains a virulence-associated two-component regulator, suiK-suiR. In silico analysis revealed that the putative lantibiotic modification gene suiM was interrupted by a 7.9-kb integron and that other biosynthesis-related genes contained various frameshift mutations. By reconstituting the intact suiM in Escherichia coli together with a semi-in vitro biosynthesis system, a putative lantibiotic named suicin was produced with bactericidal activities against a variety of Gram-positive strains, including pathogenic streptococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Ring topology dissection indicated that the 34-amino-acid lantibiotic contained two methyllanthionine residues and one disulfide bridge, which render suicin in an N-terminal linear and C-terminal globular shape. To confirm the function of suiK-suiR, SuiR was overexpressed and purified. In vitro analysis showed that SuiR could specifically bind to the suiA gene promoter. Its coexpression with suiK could activate suiA gene promoter in Lactococcus lactis NZ9000. Conclusively, we obtained a novel lantibiotic suicin by restoring its production from the remnant sui locus and demonstrated that virulence-associated SuiK-SuiR regulates its production.
TI  - [Streptococcus suis meningitis in pig farmers: report of first two cases in Chile].
AB  - Human infection by Streptococcus suis is a zoonosis with a known occupational risk. Meningitis is its most frequent clinical manifestation. We present the first two cases in Chile. FIRST CASE: 54-year-old female patient, pig-farmer. She presented headache, vomiting, confusion and meningismus. She presented septic shock. Second case: 48-year-old male patient, also pig farmer, presented headache, vomiting and meningismus. A Gram's staining of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed gram-positive cocci in both cases. Ceftriaxone and dexamethasone treatment was administered. The CSF cultures were positive for Streptococcus suis serotype 2. The patients experienced a good outcome, without neurological sequelae at the time of discharge. It is considerable to evaluate epidemiologic factors in order to suspect this etiological agent in cases of meningitis. These cases enhance the need of heighten awareness of potential for occupational exposure and infection by this emerging human pathogen. Educating population at risk about simple preventive measures must be considered.
TI  - [First case of meningitis by Streptococcus suis in the norwest area of Argentina].
AB  - Streptococcus suis causes meningitis, bacteremia, endocarditis, endophthalmitis,  artrithis and toxic shock in both pigs and human beings. The incidence of this pathogen is increasing worldwide. A case of 54 years old men from a rural zone of Tucuman, Argentina with two days of headache, vomit and photophobia was admitted septic, with purulent meningitis. Streptococcus suis was growth from the blood and cerebrospinal fluid culture. The patient was treated with ceftriaxona and had a good evolution without sequels. This is the first case of S. suis described in the northwest of Argentina and the third of Latin America, and it is emphasized that the occupational contact with pigs is an important background for the initial suspect of this pathogen.
TI  - [Laboratory confirmation of Streptococcus suis in Chile].
AB  
TI  - Streptococcus suis DNase SsnA contributes to degradation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and evasion of NET-mediated antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important cause of different pathologies in pigs and humans, most importantly fibrinosuppurative meningitis. Tissue infected with this pathogen is substantially infiltrated with neutrophils, but the function of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) - a more recently discovered antimicrobial strategy of neutrophils - in host defence against Strep. suis has not been investigated. The objective of this work was to investigate the interaction of Strep. suis with NETs in vitro. Strep. suis induced NET formation in porcine neutrophils and was entrapped but not killed by those NETs. As the amount of NETs decreased over time, we hypothesized that a known extracellular DNase of Strep. suis degrades NETs. Though this nuclease was originally designated Strep. suis-secreted nuclease A (SsnA), this work demonstrated surface association in accordance with an LPXTG cell wall anchor motif and partial release into the supernatant. Confirming our hypothesis, an isogenic ssnA mutant was significantly attenuated in NET degradation and in protection against the antimicrobial activity of NETs as determined in assays with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-stimulated human neutrophils. Though assays with PMA-stimulated porcine neutrophils suggested that SsnA also degrades porcine NETs, phenotypic differences between wt and the isogenic ssnA mutant were less distinct. As SsnA expression was crucial for neither growth in vitro nor for survival in porcine or human blood, the results indicated that SsnA is the first specific NET evasion factor to be identified in Strep. suis.
TI  - Whole-Genome Sequence of Streptococcus suis Serotype 3 Strain YB51.
AB  - We report here the second complete genome sequence of Streptococcus suis serotype 3 (strain YB51). The genome is 2,043,655 bp in length, which is 14,840 bp longer than the first reported genome of the same serotype, and it covers 2,012 coding sequences, 56 tRNAs, and 4 rRNA loci.
TI  - Prevalent distribution and conservation of Streptococcus suis Lmb protein and its protective capacity against the Chinese highly virulent strain infection.
AB  - Streptococcus suis (S. suis) is an important zoonotic pathogen that causes multiple diseases in both pigs and humans. Many studies suggest that Streptococcus utilizes host extracellular matrix proteins, including laminin, for adhesion and invasion of host cells. Recently, we identified a putative Lmb protein (CDS 0330) of a highly virulent strain of S. suis (serotype 2). In this study, we characterized the ability of CDS 0330 to bind human laminin, and evaluated the protective efficacy of a recombinant protein vaccine. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that both the amino acid sequence and tertiary structure of CDS 0330 were similar to Lmb proteins in other Streptococcus. In addition, the sequence of CDS 0330 was present in the genomes of 26 of the 38 sequenced streptococci species, indicating an early origin and conservation of this gene. Particularly, all 17 sequenced S. suis genomes, regardless of serotype or geographic origin, contained CDS 0330 gene in their genome with a minimum pair-wise amino acid identity of 92%. PCR amplification revealed that CDS 0330 gene is distributed throughout 35 S. suis serotypes in the lmb-htp format. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed that CDS 0330 was expressed on the cell surface of S. suis, and ELISA revealed the recombinant CDS 0330 protein could bind laminin in vitro. Finally, vaccinating mice with recombinant CDS 0330 protein significantly prolonged survival after S. suis infection. Together, these data reveal that CDS 0330 is a laminin binding protein of S. suis 2, and open new avenues for preventing S. suis 2 infection.
TI  - Bilateral sensorineural hearing impairment due to Streptococcus suis meningitis 20 days after swine bite.
AB  - Streptococcus suis (S. suis) is a zoonotic pathogen in pigs, which can be transmitted to humans by close contact. Meningitis is the most common clinical manifestations of S. suis infection and hearing impairment is a frequent complication. The risk of S. suis meningitis is higher in people who work in the swine industry. The patient was a 53-year-old woman working in the swine industry, who developed headache and fever 20 days after a swine bite. She was diagnosed as meningitis and S. suis was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid. We treated her with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and dexamethasone, and signs of meningeal irritation diminished three days after admission. However, bilateral sensorineural hearing impairment occurred on the ninth day after admission. We added methylprednisolone (500 mg, 2 days) but moderate hearing impairment remained on the left. Antibiotic therapy should be considered for wounds of people involved in the swine industry for preventing S. suis infection.When S. suis meningitis occurs, symptoms of hearing impairment must be monitored carefully.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of nisin against the swine pathogen Streptococcus suis and its synergistic interaction with antibiotics.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is known to cause severe infections in pigs, including meningitis, endocarditis and pneumonia. Furthermore, this bacterium is considered an emerging zoonotic agent. Recently, increased antibiotic resistance in S. suis has been reported worldwide. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of nisin, a bacteriocin of the lantibiotic class, as an antibacterial agent against the pathogen S. suis serotype 2. In addition, the synergistic activity of nisin in combination with conventional antibiotics was assessed. Using a plate assay, the nisin-producing strain Lactococcus lactis ATCC 11454 proved to be capable of inhibiting the growth of S. suis (n=18) belonging to either sequence type (ST)1, ST25, or ST28. In a microdilution broth assay, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of purified nisin ranged between 1.25 and 5 mug/mL while the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) was between 5 and 10 mug/mL toward S. suis. The use of a capsule-deficient mutant of S. suis indicated that the presence of this polysaccharidic structure has no marked impact on susceptibility to nisin. Following treatment of S. suis with nisin, transmission electron microscopy observations revealed lysis of bacteria resulting from breakdown of the cell membrane. A time-killing curve showed a rapid bactericidal activity of nisin. Lastly, synergistic effects of nisin were observed in combination with several antibiotics, including penicillin, amoxicillin, tetracycline, streptomycin and ceftiofur. This study brought clear evidence supporting the potential of nisin for the prevention and treatment of S. suis infections in pigs.
TI  - Subcytolytic effects of suilysin on interaction of Streptococcus suis with epithelial cells.
AB  - Suilysin is a pore-forming cholesterol-dependent cytolysin secreted by Streptococcus suis (S. suis), an important swine and zoonotic pathogen. The role of suilysin in S. suis host-cell interaction is still unclear. We found a higher adherence and invasion rate of an unencapsulated sly-positive strain in comparison to its isogenic sly-negative mutant. Electron microscopy revealed that formation of membrane ruffles accompanying invasion of the sly-positive strain was abolished in the sly-negative mutant. Inhibition experiments showed that the actin cytoskeleton was involved in suilysin-mediated effects. Point-mutation of the domain putatively responsible for macropore-formation resulted in abolished hemolytic and cytolysin activity, but had no effect on S. suis host cell association. Concluding, our results indicate that subcytolytic suilysin promotes S. suis association with epithelial cells.
TI  - Capsular sialic acid of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 binds to swine influenza virus and enhances bacterial interactions with virus-infected tracheal epithelial cells.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is an important swine bacterial pathogen, and it is also an emerging zoonotic agent. It is unknown how S. suis virulent strains, which are usually found in low quantities in pig tonsils, manage to cross the first host defense lines to initiate systemic disease. Influenza virus produces a contagious infection in pigs which is frequently complicated by bacterial coinfections, leading to significant economic impacts. In this study, the effect of a preceding swine influenza H1N1 virus (swH1N1) infection of swine tracheal epithelial cells (NTPr) on the ability of S. suis serotype 2 to adhere to, invade, and activate these cells was evaluated. Cells preinfected with swH1N1 showed bacterial adhesion and invasion levels that were increased more than 100-fold compared to those of normal cells. Inhibition studies confirmed that the capsular sialic acid moiety is responsible for the binding to virus-infected cell surfaces. Also, preincubation of S. suis with swH1N1 significantly increased bacterial adhesion to/invasion of epithelial cells, suggesting that S. suis also uses swH1N1 as a vehicle to invade epithelial cells when the two infections occur simultaneously. Influenza virus infection may facilitate the transient passage of S. suis at the respiratory tract to reach the bloodstream and cause bacteremia and septicemia. S. suis may also increase the local inflammation at the respiratory tract during influenza infection, as suggested by an exacerbated expression of proinflammatory mediators in coinfected cells. These results give new insight into the complex interactions between influenza virus and S. suis in a coinfection model.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a novel hemolysis-related gene in Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Streptococcussuis serotype 2 (SS 2) is an important zoonotic pathogen that has caused two major infectious outbreaks of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) in China. A novel gene located in the 89K pathogenicity island (PAI) encoding a putative hemolysin-III-related protein (Hhly3) has been previously characterized. In this study, the SS2 deletion mutant of the exogenous gene hhly3 was constructed by homologous recombination. This protein was found to exhibit cytolytic activity, and hemolytic activity of the hhly3 gene knockout mutant (Deltahhly3) was significantly lower than that in the wild-type strain ZY05719. In addition, qRT-PCR revealed that Hhly3 played an important role in the expression of the secreted hemolysin SLY, which may be the key reason for the decreased hemolytic activity. Consequently, compared with the WT strain, the infection and pathogenicity of Deltahhly3 was also decreased, as evidenced by in vitro bacterial growth in whole blood and by the in vivo zebrafish test, suggesting that hhly3 is a novel exogenous hemolysis-related gene in SS2 strains.
TI  - Alcohol consumption promotes the intestinal translocation of Streptococcus suis infections.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an emerging zoonotic agent. This study aimed to investigate whether S. suis is likely to translocate across the intestines of human hosts who have liver disease and/or consume alcohol. Both the alcoholism and cirrhosis models exhibited high mRNA expression of TGF and collagen1, but only the cirrhosis model had fibrosis in the liver. After both models were infected with S. suis, significantly different concentrations of S. suis were detected in the blood and brains of the alcoholism model (Blood: 36.4%; Brain: 31.8%) and the cirrhosis model (Blood: 62.5%; Brain: 62.5%) compared to the concentrations in the healthy mice (Blood: 15.4%; Brain: 0%). Trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TER) was used to examine the Caco-2 cells in the in vitro that had an S. suis infection combined with 1% ethanol. Although the ethanol did not influence the Caco-2 cells' barriers, it did rapidly decrease the barriers' TER value and then their E-cadherin compared to the infected Caco-2 cells without the ethanol treatment. Immunofluorescence also indicated that the barriers of the Caco-2 cells treated with ethanol were disrupted and that S. suis translocated from the apical to the basolateral side. This study demonstrated that alcohol consumption helped S. suis to translocate.

TI  - Digoxigenin-labeled in situ hybridization for the detection of Streptococcus suis DNA in polyserositis and a comparison with biotinylated in situ hybridization.
AB  - The objective of this study was to develop digoxigenin-labeled in situ hybridization (ISH) for the detection of Streptococcus suis in naturally infected pigs with polyserositis and to compare it with biotinylated ISH. Digoxigenin-labeled hybridization signals for S. suis were observed in cells that had infiltrated the fibrous polyserositis and microcolonies in the blood vessels. Mock hybridization showed no hybridization signals for endogenous digoxigenin. Biotinylated hybridization signals for S. suis were observed in cells that had infiltrated the fibrous polyserositis. However, similar hybridization signals were also observed in the fibrous inflammatory area using mock hybridization for endogenous biotin. The present study demonstrated that digoxigenin-labeled ISH is a valuable diagnostic tool for specific detection of S. suis in polyserositic tissues without nonspecific reactions compared with biotinylated ISH.

TI  - Development of multiplex PCR assays for the identification of the 33 serotypes of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcussuis is an important zoonotic agent causing severe diseases in pigs  and humans. To date, 33 serotypes of S. suis have been identified based on antigenic differences in the capsular polysaccharide. The capsular polysaccharide synthesis (cps) locus encodes proteins/enzymes that are responsible for capsular production and variation in the capsule structures are the basis of S. suis serotyping. Multiplex and/or simplex PCR assays have been developed for 15 serotypes based on serotype-specific genes in the cps gene cluster. In this study, we developed a set of multiplex PCR (mPCR) assays to identify the 33 currently known S. suis serotypes. To identify serotype-specific genes for mPCR, the entire genomes of reference strains for the 33 serotypes were sequenced using whole genome high-throughput sequencing, and the cps gene clusters from these strains were identified and compared. We developed a set of 4 mPCR assays based on the polysaccharide polymerase gene wzy, one of the serotype-specific genes. The assays can identify all serotypes except for two pairs of serotypes: 1 and 14, and 2 and 1/2, which have no serotype-specific genes between them. The first assay identifies 12 serotypes (serotypes 1 to 10, 1/2, and 14) that are the most frequently isolated from diseased pigs and patients; the second identifies 10 serotypes (serotypes 11 to 21 except 14); the third identifies the remaining 11 serotypes (serotypes 22 to 31, and 33); and the fourth identifies a new cps cluster of S. suis discovered in this study in 16 isolates that agglutinated with antisera for serotypes 29 and 21. The multiplex PCR assays developed in this study provide a rapid and specific method for molecular serotyping of S. suis.
TI  - Effect of licochalcone A on growth and properties of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis (S.suis) is an important emerging worldwide pig pathogen and zoonotic agent with rapid evolution of virulence and drug resistance. In this study, we wanted to investigate the effect of licochalcone A on growth and properties of Streptococcus suis. The antimicrobial activity of licochalcone A was tested by growth inhibition assay and the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) also were determined. The effect of licochalcone A on S.suis biofilm formation was characterized by crystal violet staining. The effect of licochalcone A on suilysin secretion was evaluated by titration of hemolytic activity. To understand the antimicrobial effect, gene expression profile of S.suis treated by licochalcone A was analyzed by DNA microarray. Our results demonstrated that licochalcone A showed antimicrobial activity on S.suis with MICs of 4 microg/ml for S.suis serotype 2 strains and 8 microg/ml for S.suis serotype 7 strains. Biofilm formation was inhibited by 30-40% in the presence of licochalcone A (3 microg/ml) and suilysin secretion was also significantly inhibited in the presence of licochalcone A (1.5 microg/ml). The gene expression profile of S.suis in the presence of licochalcone A showed that 132 genes were differentially regulated, and we analyzed the regulated genes in the aspect of the bacterial cell cycle control. Among the deregulated genes, the genes responsible for the mass doubling was increased expression, but the genes responsible for DNA replication and cell division were inhibited the expression. So, we think the regulation of the cell cycle genes might provide a mechanistic understanding of licochalcone A mediated antimicrobial effect against S.suis.
TI  - Development of a LAMP assay for rapid detection of different intimin variants of  attaching and effacing microbial pathogens.
AB  - Intimin harboured by pathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) strains is a key virulence factor involved in host cell adherence and colonization. Twenty-seven intimin-encoding E. coli attaching and effacing (eae) gene variants have been reported according to their 3' binding domain sequences. In our study, we developed a specific and sensitive loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay to detect all known intimin variants. Four primers specific for six regions of eae genes were designed using online software. The eae-LAMP assay was highly specific and detected all 27 tested eae variants; no cross-reactions were observed with genes from enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), E. coli BL21, Salmonella, Shigella, Listeria monocytogenes, or Streptococcus suis type 2 (SS2). With the lowest detection limit of approximately 10 copies per reaction the eae-LAMP assay was 100 times more sensitive than conventional PCR. These results, and the results of tests involving food and faecal samples artificially contaminated with E. coli O157 : H7 (eaegamma+), show that the eae-LAMP assay is a simple, rapid, sensitive and specific tool for detecting intimin variants from pathogenic strains of E. coli. The eae-LAMP assay has great potential for wider applications, not only in the laboratory but also in the field setting, as it does not require specialized equipment.
TI  - Rapid visual detection of highly pathogenic Streptococcus suis serotype 2 isolates by use of loop-mediated isothermal amplification.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S. suis 2) is an important zoonotic pathogen that  causes considerable economic losses to the pig industry and significantly threatens public health worldwide. The highly pathogenic S. suis 2, which contains the 89K pathogenicity island (PAI), has caused large-scale outbreaks of infections in humans, resulting in high mortality rates. In this study, we established two loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)-based assays that can rapidly detect S. suis 2 and the 89K PAI and can be performed simultaneously under the same conditions. Further, based on the findings of these two LAMP assays and using the same set of serially diluted DNA samples, we compared the sensitivities of different LAMP product detection methods, including SYBR green detection, gel electrophoresis, turbidimetry, calcein assays, and hydroxynaphthol blue detection. The results suggest that target genes can be amplified and detected within 48 min under 63 degrees C isothermal conditions. The sensitivity of tests for S. suis 2 detection varies between detection methods and reaction systems, indicating that for each LAMP reaction system, multiple detection methods should be performed to select the optimal one. The sensitivities of the optimized methods (7.16 copies/reaction) in the present study were identical to those of the real-time PCR assay, and the test results for reference strains and clinical samples showed that these LAMP systems have high specificities. Thus, since the LAMP systems established in this study are simple, fast, and sensitive, they may have good clinical potential for detecting the highly pathogenic S. suis 2.
TI  - Characterization of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 isolates from China.
AB  - Streptococcus suis (S. suis) is a major pathogen in the pig industry and an important zoonotic agent that causes severe invasive diseases in humans. Previous studies based on multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and the associations between sequence types and genotypes or virulence suggested that North American S. suis serotype 2 isolates are composed of multiple populations. This study investigated the population structure of S. suis serotype 2 isolates in China. We constructed a phylogenetic tree for S. suis serotype 2 isolates based on 16S rRNA gene typing and MLST, studied associations between clades and sources, analyzed the genotype distributions of virulence markers [muramidase-released protein (MRP), extracellular protein factor (EF), and suilysin (SLY)] in different clades, computed the selection pressures for these virulence marker genes, and verified the associations between clades and virulence. There were two primary clades (populations) in the phylogenetic tree of S. suis serotype 2. The two populations were associated with different tissue tropisms. The genotypic distributions and selection pressures of MRP, EF, and SLY were different between the two populations, which suggested that they had different evolutionary paths. The two populations also displayed differences in virulence in experimentally infected mice. The results provide insights into the population structure of S. suis serotype 2 isolates in China and suggest that S. suis serotype 2 clade 1 is an overlooked population that deserves further evaluation.
TI  - The genetically modified suilysin, rSLY(P353L), provides a candidate vaccine that suppresses proinflammatory response and reduces fatality following infection with Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is a persistent global hazard in the swine industry and an emerging threat to public health. The high mortality in China following outbreaks of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) underscores the urgency for effective prevention. A limited understanding of the pathogenesis of S. suis in STSS may explain the lack of biological products for prevention. Suilysin (SLY) is an important virulence factor in the pathogenesis of S. suis. To identify a candidate vaccine for S. suis-induced STSS, we constructed a recombinant non-hemolytic mutant of SLY that has hemagglutination activity, rSLY(P353L), and evaluated its ability to induce inflammatory response and prevent fatal S. suis infection in mice. The rSLY(P353L) mutant, as compared with hemolytic rSLY, elicited lower levels of IL-6, KC and IL-10 at 3h and 5h post-treatment (p<0.05), indicating that hemolytic activity is associated with rSLY-mediated inflammation. Furthermore, passive immunization with anti-SLY(P353L) antisera protected mice from acute death after infection with S. suis SC84 (p<0.05). Effects were not due to protection against tissue damage, as S. suis SC84 caused no detectable histopathological lesions in mice within 24h. However, immunization with rSLY(P353L) caused significantly reduced levels of KC and IL-1beta at 6 and 9h post-challenge and IL-6 at 9h post-challenge (p<0.05). In conclusion, rSLY(P353L) may provide a potential vaccine for protection against S. suis-induced STSS due to its reduction in proinflammatory response early in S. suis infection.
TI  - Pig alpha1-acid glycoprotein: characterization and first description in any species as a negative acute phase protein.
AB  - The serum protein alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), also known as orosomucoid, is generally described as an archetypical positive acute phase protein. Here, porcine AGP was identified, purified and characterized from pooled pig serum. It was found to circulate as a single chain glycoprotein having an apparent molecular weight of 43 kDa by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, of which approximately 17 kDa were accounted for by N-bound oligosaccharides. Those data correspond well with the properties of the protein predicted from the single porcine AGP gene (ORM1, Q29014 (UniProt)), containing 5 putative glycosylation sites. A monoclonal antibody (MAb) was produced and shown to quantitatively and specifically react with all microheterogenous forms of pig AGP as analyzed by 2-D electrophoresis. This MAb was used to develop an immunoassay (ELISA) for quantification of AGP in pig serum samples. The adult serum concentrations of pig AGP were in the range of 1-3 mg/ml in a number of conventional pig breeds while it was lower in Gottingen and Ossabaw minipigs (in the 0.3 to 0.6 mg/ml range) and higher in young (2-5 days old) conventional pigs (mean: 6.6 mg/ml). Surprisingly, pig AGP was found to behave as a negative acute phase protein during a range of experimental infections and aseptic inflammation with significant decreases in serum concentration and in hepatic ORM1 expression during the acute phase response. To our knowledge this is the first description in any species of AGP being a negative acute phase protein.
TI  - Complete Genome Sequence of Streptococcus suis Serotype 16 Strain TL13.
AB  - We report here the first complete genome sequence of Streptococcus suis serotype  16, which has been identified to be zoonotic. The sequenced strain TL13 was isolated from a pig in China. The genome is 2,038,146 bp in length, covering 1,950 coding sequences, 53 tRNAs, and 4 rRNA loci.
TI  - Group B Streptococcus and Streptococcus suis capsular polysaccharides induce chemokine production by dendritic cells via Toll-like receptor 2- and MyD88-dependent and -independent pathways.
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae (also known as group B Streptococcus [GBS]) and Streptococcus suis are encapsulated streptococci causing severe septicemia and meningitis. Bacterial capsular polysaccharides (CPSs) are poorly immunogenic, but anti-CPS antibodies are essential to the host defense against encapsulated bacteria. The mechanisms underlying anti-CPS antibody responses are not fully elucidated, but the biochemistry of CPSs, particularly the presence of sialic acid, may have an immunosuppressive effect. We investigated the ability of highly purified S. suis and GBS native (sialylated) CPSs to activate dendritic cells (DCs), which are crucial actors in the initiation of humoral immunity. The influence of CPS biochemistry was studied using CPSs extracted from different serotypes within these two streptococcal species, as well as desialylated CPSs. No interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, IL-12p70, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), or IL-10 production was observed in S. suis or GBS CPS-stimulated DCs. Moreover, these CPSs exerted immunosuppressive effects on DC activation, as a diminution of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-induced B cell-activating factor of the tumor necrosis factor family (BAFF) expression was observed in CPS-pretreated cells. However, S. suis and GBS CPSs induced significant production of CCL3, via partially Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)- and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-dependent pathways, and CCL2, via TLR-independent mechanisms. No major influence of CPS biochemistry was observed on the capacity to induce chemokine production by DCs, indicating that DCs respond to these CPSs in a patterned way rather than a structure-dedicated manner.
TI  - Identification of in-vivo induced genes of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 specially expressed in infected human.
AB  - Streptococcus suis (S. suis) serotype 2 usually cause infection in swine. Recently, two large-scale outbreaks in China with severe streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) and high mortality raised worldwide concern to human S. suis infection. To reveal the molecular pathogenesis of S. suis 2 during human infection, in-vivo induced antigen technology (IVIAT) was applied to identify the in-vivo induced genes (ivi genes) of S. suis 05ZYH33. The ivi genes are specifically expressed or up-regulated in-vivo and always associated with the in-vivo survival and pathogenicity of pathogens. In present study, convalescent sera from S. suis 05ZYH33 infected patients were pooled and fully adsorbed with in-vitro grown S. suis 05ZYH33 and Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Genomic expression library of 05ZYH33 was repeatedly screened with colony immunoblot assay using adsorbed sera. Finally, 19 genes were assessed as ivi genes of 05ZYH33. Fifteen of 19 genes encode proteins with biological functions in substance transport and metabolism, cell structure biogenesis, cell cycle control, replication, translation and other functions. The 4 remaining genes encode proteins with unknown functions. Of the 19 ivi genes, five (SSU05_0247, 0437, 1577, 1664 and 2144) encode proteins with no immunoreactivity to control sera from healthy individuals never exposed to 05ZYH33. The successful identification of ivi genes not only sheds light on understanding the pathogenesis of S. suis 05ZYH33 during its human infection, but also provides potential targets for the developments of new vaccines, therapeutic drugs and diagnostic reagents against human S. suis infection.
TI  - [Anti-phagocytosis mechanism of SalK/SalR, a two-component regulatory system of Streptococcus suis serotype 2].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of the two-component regulatory system (TCS) SalK/SalR in the resistance of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) phagocytosed by THP-1-derived macrophages (THP-Mphi). METHODS: Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the capsular differences between the wild-type strain 05ZYH33 and the mutant deltasalKR were observed. The interactions of SS2 with THP-Mphi were monitored by Gram staining and immunofluorescence cytochemistry. The anti-phagocytic activity of SS2 was evaluated by the construction of phagocytosis model of THP-Mphi. RESULTS: The TEM showed that in the mutant deltasalKR, the capsule was lost; the Gram staining and immunofluorescence imaging revealed that the absence of salKR caused more SS2 were engulfed by THP-Mphi. The phagocytosis model of THP-Mphi cells further demonstrated that the mutant deltasalKR was easier to be phagocytosed by THP-1 cells than the wild-type strain. CONCLUSION: The SalK/SalR regulatory system resists the phagocytosis by THP- Mphi through the capsular formation, but the mechanism of how it regulates the formation of the capsule needs further elucidation.
TI  - Screening of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae LuxS inhibitors.
AB  - LuxS, a conserved bacterial enzyme involved in the activated methyl cycle, catalyzes S-ribosylhomocysteine (SRH) into homocysteine and AI-2 (the inter-species quorum-sensing signal molecule). This enzyme has been reported to be essential for the survival of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae in its natural host. Therefore, it is a potential drug target against A. pleuropneumoniae, an important swine respiratory pathogen causing great economic losses in the pig industry worldwide. In this study, the enzymatic activity determination method was established using the recombinant LuxS of A. pleuropneumoniae. Thirty-five compounds similar to the shape of SRH were screened from the Specs compound library by the software vROCS and were evaluated for LuxS inhibition. Three compounds could inhibit LuxS activity. Two of them were confirmed to be competitive inhibitors and the third one was uncompetitive. All the three compounds displayed inhibitory effects on the growth of A. pleuropneumoniae and two other important swine pathogens, Haemophilis parasuis and Streptococcus suis, with MIC50 values ranging from 11 to 51 mug/ml. No significant cytotoxic effect of the compounds was detected on porcine PK-15 cells at the concentration which showed inhibitory effect on bacterial growth. These results suggest that LuxS is an ideal target to develop antimicrobials for porcine bacterial pathogens. The three LuxS inhibitors identified in this study can be used as lead compounds for drug design.
TI  - The use of dried cerebrospinal fluid filter paper spots as a substrate for PCR diagnosis of the aetiology of bacterial meningitis in the Lao PDR.
AB  - We investigated whether dried cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) conserved on filter paper can be used as a substrate for accurate PCR diagnosis of important causes of bacterial meningitis in the Lao PDR. Using mock CSF, we investigated and optimized filter paper varieties, paper punch sizes, elution volumes and quantities of DNA template to achieve sensitive and reliable detection of bacterial DNA from filter paper specimens. FTA Elute Micro Card (Whatman, Maidstone, UK) was the most sensitive, consistent and practical variety of filter paper. Following optimization, the lower limit of detection for Streptococcus pneumoniae from dried mock CSF spots was 14 genomic equivalents (GE)/muL (interquartile range 5.5 GE/muL) or 230 (IQR 65) colony forming units/mL. A prospective clinical evaluation for S. pneumoniae, S. suis and Neisseria meningitidis was performed. Culture and PCR performed on fresh liquid CSF from patients admitted with a clinical diagnosis of meningitis (n = 73) were compared with results derived from dried CSF spots. Four of five fresh PCR-positive CSF samples also tested PCR positive from dried CSF spots, with one patient under the limit of detection. In a retrospective study of S. pneumoniae samples (n = 20), the median (IQR; range) CSF S. pneumoniae bacterial load was 1.1 x 10(4) GE/muL (1.2 x 10(5) ; 1 to 6.1 x 10(6) DNA GE/muL). Utilizing the optimized methodology, we estimate an extrapolated sensitivity of 90%, based on the range of CSF genome counts found in Laos. Dried CSF filter paper spots could potentially help us to better understand the epidemiology of bacterial meningitis in resource-poor settings and guide empirical treatments and vaccination policies.
TI  - Socio-economic, industrial and cultural parameters of pig-borne infections.
AB  - The pork-processing industry has been possibly the fastest growing sector of the  food industry in recent years. Specialization, genetic homogenization of the pig population, high density of the breeding population, reduced human-animal interactions, slaughter at a lower age and increased international trade of live animals and pork are parameters that affect, positively or negatively, the emergence of novel pig-borne pathogens, many of which are pig-specific, and many of which have significant zoonotic potential, as observed in recent outbreaks of Nipah virus and Streptococcus suis in Southeast Asia and China, respectively. Numerous other pathogens are transmitted to humans through direct contact with or consumption of pig products, and globalization trends in trade and human population movements have resulted in outbreaks of pig-borne diseases even in Muslim countries and in Israel, where pork consumption is religiously prohibited. The role of pigs as potential reservoirs of antibiotic-resistant pathogens or genes encoding resistance, and the role of feral pigs as a reservoir of zoonotic disease, are scientific fields in direct need of further research.
TI  - First report of the multiresistance gene cfr in Streptococcus suis.
AB  - The multiresistance gene cfr was identified for the first time in streptococci, namely, in porcine Streptococcus suis isolate S10. The cfr gene was detected on the ~100-kb plasmid pStrcfr, where it was bracketed by two copies of the novel insertion sequence ISEnfa5, located in the same orientation. The detection of a cfr- and ISEnfa5-containing amplicon by inverse PCR suggests that ISEnfa5 may play a role in the dissemination of cfr.
TI  - Improved bacterial mutagenesis by high-frequency allele exchange, demonstrated in Clostridium difficile and Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Here we show that the frequency of mutant isolation by two-step allele exchange can be improved by increasing the length of homologous DNA and the opportunity for recombination, obviating the need for counterselection markers. These principles are demonstrated in Clostridium difficile and Streptococcus suis but are likely to be generally applicable.
TI  - Genetic analysis of Streptococcus suis isolates from wild rabbits.
AB  - This work aims to investigate the presence of Streptococcus suis in wild rabbits. A total of 65 S. suis isolates were recovered from 33.3% of the wild rabbits examined. Most isolates (86.2%) belong to genotype cps9. These isolates were further characterized by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and virulence genotyping. Overall, S. suis exhibited a low genetic diversity. Only 5 genetic profiles were obtained by PFGE and most isolates (71.4%) were included in two pulsotypes that were also widely distributed among the wild rabbit population. MLST analysis assigned all cps9 isolates into three new singlestones (ST216, ST217 and ST284), which were not genetically related to the European ST87 and Spanish ST61 widespread swine clones, indicating a different genetic background for the S. suis isolates from wild rabbits and pigs. Wild rabbit isolates exhibited the genotype mrp-/epf-/sly-, different from those showed by most of the swine S. suis isolates of the ST87 and ST61 clones. None of the S. suis isolated from wild rabbits exhibited the genotype cps2/mrp+/epf+/sly+ associated with human infections. These results indicate that S. suis isolates from wild rabbits are not genetically related with prevalent clones usually associated with infections in pigs or humans in Europe and do not exhibit either their virulence genotypes. Therefore, although wild rabbits could represent an unknown reservoir of this pathogen, they could not represent a potential risk for pigs or humans.
TI  - Toll-like receptor 2-independent host innate immune response against an epidemic  strain of Streptococcus suis that causes a toxic shock-like syndrome in humans.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an emerging zoonotic agent causing meningitis and septicemia. Outbreaks in humans in China with atypical cases of streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome have been described to be caused by a clonal epidemic S. suis strain characterized as sequence type (ST) 7 by multilocus sequence typing, different from the classical ST1 usually isolated in Europe. Previous in vitro studies showed that Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 plays a major role in S. suis ST1 interactions with host cells. In the present study, the in vivo role of TLR2 in systemic infections caused by S. suis ST1 or ST7 strains using TLR2 deficient (TLR2(-/-)) mice was evaluated. TLR2-mediated recognition significantly contributes to the acute disease caused by the highly virulent S. suis ST1 strain, since the TLR2(-/-) mice remained unaffected when compared to wild type (WT) mice. The lack of mortality could not be associated with a lower bacterial burden; however, a significant decrease in the induction of pro-inflammatory mediators, as evaluated by microarray, real-time PCR and protein assays, was observed. On the other hand, TLR2(-/-) mice infected with the epidemic ST7 strain presented no significant differences regarding survival and expression of pro-inflammatory mediators when compared to the WT mice. Together, these results show a TLR2-independent host innate immune response to S. suis that depends on the strain.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary crystallographic analysis of recombinant hyaluronate lyase from Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Hyaluronate lyase is an important surface enzyme of many streptococcal species. The enzyme degrades several biologically important connective tissue components, which facilitates the spreading of the bacteria throughout the host tissues and presumably provides energy and a carbon source for bacterial cells. Recombinant hyaluronate lyase was expressed in Escherichia coli and was crystallized using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. The crystals belonged to space group P222(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 58.08, b = 101.32, c = 103.47 A and one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Diffraction data were collected to 2.50 A resolution.
TI  - [Septic arthritis caused by Streptococcus suis].
AB  - Streptococcus suis is a global endemic swine pathogen. S. suis can cause meningitis, endocarditis and severe sepsis in humans, who are exposed to swine. Human infection with S. suis was first reported in 1968, since then, human infections have been sporadic although an outbreak in China counted 215 cases. In a rare case of disseminated arthritis we found that correct clinical diagnosis was difficult due to unspecific symptomatology and slow growing bacterial culture. However, conducting thorough examinations is crucial, and if treated correctly the outcome is favourable.
TI  - Minimum core genome sequence typing of bacterial pathogens: a unified approach for clinical and public health microbiology.
AB  - Bacterial pathogens impose a heavy health burden worldwide. In the new era of high-throughput sequencing and online bioinformatics, real-time genome typing of infecting agents, and in particular those with potential severe clinical outcomes, holds promise for guiding clinical care to limit the detrimental effects of infections and to prevent potential local or global outbreaks. Here, we sequenced and compared 85 isolates of Streptococcus suis, a zoonotic human and swine pathogen, wherein we analyzed 32 recognized serotypes and 75 sequence types representing the diversity of the species and the human clinical isolates with high public health significance. We found that 1,077 of the 2,469 genes are shared by all isolates. Excluding 201 common but mobile genes, 876 genes were defined as the minimum core genome (MCG) of the species. Of 190,894 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified, 58,501 were located in the MCG genes and were referred to as MCG SNPs. A population structure analysis of these MCG SNPs classified the 85 isolates into seven MCG groups, of which MCG group 1 includes all isolates from human infections and outbreaks. Our MCG typing system for S. suis provided a clear separation of groups containing human-associated isolates from those containing animal-associated isolates. It also separated the group containing outbreak isolates, including those causing life-threatening streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome, from sporadic or less severe meningitis or bacteremia-only isolates. The typing system facilitates the application of genome data to the fields of clinical medicine and epidemiology and to the surveillance of S. suis. The MCG groups may also be used as the taxonomical units of S. suis to define bacterial subpopulations with the potential to cause severe clinical infections and large-scale outbreaks.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance and prudent drug use for Streptococcus suis.
AB  - This paper reviews information on antimicrobial resistance patterns and prudent use of antimicrobials to reduce the impact and spread of resistant Streptococcus suis strains. S. suis is an important pathogen in swine, which can cause significant economic loss. Prudent use of antimicrobials for S. suis is essential to preserve the therapeutic efficacy of broad-spectrum antimicrobials and to minimize selection of resistant S. suis strains. Resistance of S. suis to antimicrobials commonly used in swine, including lincosamides, macrolides, sulphonamides, and tetracycline, has been documented worldwide, with resistance in up to 85% of strains. Among antimicrobials examined, resistance of S. suis has been demonstrated to be relatively low for penicillin (0-27%), ampicillin (0.6-23%), and ceftiofur (0-23%). For penicillin, this result may be due in part to the unique mechanism by which resistance is acquired through modifications in the structure of penicillin-binding proteins. Recommendations to control S. suis infection include focused and careful choice and appropriate use of antimicrobials, together with preventive measures intended to improve swine management.
TI  - [Construction and virulence evaluation of the virB1-89K gene knockout mutant of type IV-like secretion system of Streptococcus suis serotype 2].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To construct the virB1-89K gene knockout mutant and its complementary  strain of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) highly virulent strain 05ZYH33 and evaluate the role of virB1-89K in the pathogenesis of SS2. METHODS: The virB1-89K gene was knocked out by homologous recombination, then multiple-PCR and sequence analysis were used to identify the knockout strain deltavirB1-89K. The virB1-89K gene and its upstream promoter were cloned into the E. coli-S. suis shuttle vector pSET1, and the recombinant plasmid was electrotransformed into the deltavirB1-89K mutant to generate the complementary strain CvirB1-89K. The effects of virB1-89K deletion on the basic biological characteristics and virulence of SS2 were then determined in this study. RESULTS: The isogenic mutant deltavirB1-89K and its complementary strain CvirB1-89K were successfully constructed. No significant differences in biological characteristics were found among the three strains. However, the virulence of the deltavirB1-89K mutant was reduced to 30% of the wild-type level and functional complementation of virB1-89K restored its pathogenicity. CONCLUSION: The virB1-89K gene plays an important role in the pathogenesis of S. suis 2 infection.
TI  - SatR is a repressor of fluoroquinolone efflux pump SatAB.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an emerging zoonotic agent responsible for high-mortality outbreaks among the human population in China. In this species, the ABC transporter SatAB mediates fluoroquinolone resistance when overexpressed. Here, we describe and characterize satR, an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a MarR superfamily regulator that acts as a repressor of satAB. satR is cotranscribed with satAB, and its interruption entails the overexpression of the pump, leading to a clinically relevant increase in resistance to fluoroquinolones.
TI  - [Construction and identification of recombinant adenovirus of muramidase-released protein gene fragment from Streptococcus suis type 2].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To construct and identify the recombinant adenovirus of muramidase-released protein (MRP) gene fragment from Streptococcus suis type 2 (SS2). METHODS: The specific primers were designed based on the sequence of MRP gene fragment. The MRP gene fragment (467-1351 bp) was amplified by PCR method with genomic DNA of SS2 as a template. PCR products were cloned in pMD18-T vector. Then MRP gene fragment was linked into the adenovirus shuttle plasmid (pShuttle-CMV) to construct recombinant shuttle plasmid (pShuttle-CMV-MRP). After PmeI digestion, it was transformed into BJ5183-AD-1 competent cells containing adenoviral backbone plasmid pAdEasy-1 to construct homogeneous recombinant adenovirus plasmid (pAdeno-CMV-MRP). Then the recombinant adenovirus plasmid was linearized by PmeI and then transfected into AD-293 cells for viral packaging. Finally, the virus liquid was tested by PCR and Western blotting. RESULTS: Cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed at 8 d after transfection of linear pAdeno-CMV-MRP in AD-293 cells. MRP gene fragment and protein expression were also detected in the virus liquid. CONCLUSION: The recombinant adenovirus of MRP gene fragment (rAdeno-MRP) from SS2 was constructed successfully.
TI  - Postmortem diagnosis of sudden unexpected death from Streptococcus suis type 2 infection: a case report.
AB  - Streptococcus suis causes meningitis, septicemia, arthritis, endocarditis and death in both pigs and humans. Sudden death is rarely documented in the forensic field and almost all cases were diagnosed pre-mortem. Here we report a 49-year-old man who died from S. suis type 2 infection. S. suis was identified as the causative pathogen using bacterial culture, standard biochemical and coagglutination tests, specific DNA amplification by polymerase chain reaction, and histopathologic examination. We discuss the postmortem investigation of a suspected S. suis infection.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a new cell surface protein possessing factor H-binding activity in the swine pathogen and zoonotic agent Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is a major swine pathogen and an emerging zoonotic agent. The  ability of pathogenic bacteria to bind the complement regulator factor H on their cell surface may allow them to avoid complement attack and phagocytosis. The aim of this study was to characterize a new cell surface protein possessing factor H-binding activity in S. suis serotype 2. The capacity of S. suis to bind the complement regulator factor H on its surface was demonstrated by ELISA. Using a factor I-cofactor assay, it was found that the functional activity of factor H bound to S. suis was kept. Since the product of gene SSU0186 in S. suis P1/7 shared similarity with a Streptococcus pneumoniae protein (named PspC) possessing factor H-binding activity, it was proposed as a putative factor H receptor in S. suis. SSU0186 has a 1686 bp open reading frame encoding a 561 amino acid protein containing the Gram-positive cell wall anchoring motif (LPXTG) at the carboxy-terminal, an amino-terminal signal sequence, an alpha-helix domain, a proline-rich region and a G5 domain. The SSU0186 gene was cloned in Escherichia coli and the purified recombinant factor H-binding protein showed a molecular mass of 95 kDa, as determined by SDS-PAGE. The protein possessed the functional property of binding factor H. Sera from S. suis-infected pigs reacted with the recombinant factor H receptor, suggesting that it is produced during the course of infections. In conclusion, we identified a novel S. suis cell surface protein that binds the complement factor H. This cell surface protein may help S. suis to resist complement attack and phagocytosis and contribute to pathogenesis.
TI  - Effect of spatial separation of pigs on spread of Streptococcus suis serotype 9.
AB  - The spread of an infectious agent in a population can be reduced by interfering in the infectiousness or susceptibility of individuals, and/or in their contact structure. The aim of this study was to quantify the effect of prevention of direct contact between infectious and susceptible pigs on the transmission of Streptococcus suis (S. suis). In three replicate experiments, S. suis-free pigs were housed in boxes either in pairs (25 pairs) or alone (15 pigs). The distance between the boxes was +/-1 m. At 7 weeks of age, one pig of each pair was inoculated intranasally with S. suis serotype 9; the other pigs were exposed to S. suis by either direct (pairs) or indirect contact (individually housed pigs). Tonsillar brush and saliva swab samples from all pigs were collected regularly for 4 weeks post inoculation to monitor colonization with S. suis. All inoculated pigs became infected, and their pen mates became colonized within 2 days. Thirteen indirectly exposed pigs became positive within 7-25 days after exposure. The rate of direct transmission betadir was estimated to be 3.58 per pig per day (95% CI: 2.29-5.60). The rate of indirect transmission increased in time, depending on the cumulative number of days pigs tested positive for the presence of S. suis. The estimate beta'ind was 0.001 (95% CI: 0.0006-0.0017) new infections per pig per day for each day that an infected pig was tested positive for S. suis. We conclude that prevention of direct contact reduces the rate at which susceptible pigs become colonized. Simulation studies using these parameters showed, however, that such intervention measure would not limit S. suis serotype 9 spread in a commercial pig farm to a relevant extent, implying that spatial separation of groups op pigs within a compartment would not be effective on a farm.
TI  - Comparative genomic analysis of twelve Streptococcus suis (pro)phages.
AB  - Streptococcus suis (S. suis) is an important pathogen that can carry prophages. Here we present a comparative genomic analysis of twelve (pro)phages identified in the genomes of S. suis isolates. According to the putative functions of the open reading frames predicted, all genomes could be organized into five major functionally gene clusters involved in lysogeny, replication, packaging, morphogenesis and lysis. Phylogenetic analyses of the prophage sequences revealed that the prophages could be divided into five main groups. Whereas the genome content of the prophages in groups 1, 2 and 3 showed quite some similarity, the genome structures of prophages in groups 4 and 5 were quite distinct. Interestingly, several genes homologous to known virulence factors, including virulence associated protein E, a toxin-antitoxin system, a Clp protease and a DNA methyltransferase were found to be associated with various (pro)phages. This clearly indicates that these (pro)phages can contribute to the virulence of their hosts.
TI  - Novel bacteriophage lysin with broad lytic activity protects against mixed infection by Streptococcus pyogenes and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus [GrAS]) cause serious and sometimes fatal human diseases. They are among the many Gram-positive pathogens for which resistance to leading antibiotics has emerged. As a result, alternative therapies need to be developed to combat these pathogens. We have identified a novel bacteriophage lysin (PlySs2), derived from a Streptococcus suis phage, with broad lytic activity against MRSA, vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA), Streptococcus suis, Listeria, Staphylococcus simulans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus [GBS]), S. pyogenes, Streptococcus sanguinis, group G streptococci (GGS), group E streptococci (GES), and Streptococcus pneumoniae. PlySs2 has an N-terminal cysteine-histidine aminopeptidase (CHAP) catalytic domain and a C-terminal SH3b binding domain. It is stable at 50 degrees C for 30 min, 37 degrees C for >24 h, 4 degrees C for 15 days, and -80 degrees C for >7 months; it maintained full activity after 10 freeze-thaw cycles. PlySs2 at 128 mug/ml in vitro reduced MRSA and S. pyogenes growth by 5 logs and 3 logs within 1 h, respectively, and exhibited a MIC of 16 mug/ml for MRSA. A single, 2-mg dose of PlySs2 protected 92% (22/24) of the mice in a bacteremia model of mixed MRSA and S. pyogenes infection. Serially increasing exposure of MRSA and S. pyogenes to PlySs2 or mupirocin resulted in no observed resistance to PlySs2 and resistance to mupirocin. To date, no other lysin has shown such notable broad lytic activity, stability, and efficacy against multiple, leading, human bacterial pathogens; as such, PlySs2 has all the characteristics to be an effective therapeutic.
TI  - Structure determination of Streptococcus suis serotype 14 capsular polysaccharide.
AB  - The capsular polysaccharide (CPS) of Streptococcus suis serotype 14 was purified, chemically modified, and characterized. Sugar and absolute configuration analyses gave the following CPS composition: D-Gal, 3; D-Glc, 1; D-GlcNAc, 1; D-Neu5Ac, 1. The Sambucus nigra lectin, which recognizes the Neu5Ac(alpha2-6)Gal/GalNAc sequence, showed binding to the native CPS. Sialic acid was found to be terminal, and the CPS was quantitatively desialylated by mild acid hydrolysis. It was also submitted to periodate oxidation followed by borohydride reduction and Smith degradation. Sugar and methylation analyses, (1)H and (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectrometry of the native CPS or of its specifically modified products allowed to determine the repeating unit sequence: [6)[Neu5Ac(alpha2-6)Gal(beta1-4)GlcNAc(beta1-3)]Gal(beta1-3)Gal(beta1-4)Glc(beta1 -](n). S. suis serotype 14 CPS has an identical sialic acid-containing side chain as serotype 2 CPS, but differs by the absence of rhamnose in its composition. The same side chain is also present in group B Streptococcus type Ia CPS, except that in the latter sialic acid is 2,3- rather than 2,6-linked to the following galactose. A correlation between the S. suis CPS sequence and genes of the serotype 14 cps locus encoding putative glycosyltransferases and polymerase responsible for the biosynthesis of the repeating unit is proposed.
TI  - Insight into the evolution of the histidine triad protein (HTP) family in Streptococcus.
AB  - The Histidine Triad Proteins (HTPs), also known as Pht proteins in Streptococcus  pneumoniae, constitute a family of surface-exposed proteins that exist in many pathogenic streptococcal species. Although many studies have revealed the importance of HTPs in streptococcal physiology and pathogenicity, little is known about their origin and evolution. In this study, after identifying all htp homologs from 105 streptococcal genomes representing 38 different species/subspecies, we analyzed their domain structures, positions in genome, and most importantly, their evolutionary histories. By further projecting this information onto the streptococcal phylogeny, we made several major findings. First, htp genes originated earlier than the Streptococcus genus and gene-loss events have occurred among three streptococcal groups, resulting in the absence of the htp gene in the Bovis, Mutans and Salivarius groups. Second, the copy number of htp genes in other groups of Streptococcus is variable, ranging from one to four functional copies. Third, both phylogenetic evidence and domain structure analyses support the division of two htp subfamilies, designated as htp I and htp II. Although present mainly in the pyogenic group and in Streptococcus suis, htp II members are distinct from htp I due to the presence of an additional leucine-rich-repeat domain at the C-terminus. Finally, htp genes exhibit a faster nucleotide substitution rate than do housekeeping genes. Specifically, the regions outside the HTP domains are under strong positive selection. This distinct evolutionary pattern likely helped Streptococcus to easily escape from recognition by host immunity.
TI  - Zinc as an agent for the prevention of biofilm formation by pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: Biofilm formation is important for the persistence of bacteria in hostile environments. Bacteria in a biofilm are usually more resistant to antibiotics and disinfectants than planktonic bacteria. Our laboratory previously reported that low concentrations of zinc inhibit biofilm formation of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of zinc on growth and biofilm formation of other bacterial swine pathogens. METHODS AND RESULTS: To determine the effect of zinc on biofilm formation, biofilms were grown with or without zinc in 96-well plates and stained with crystal violet. At micromolar concentrations (0-250 mu mol l(-1)), zinc weakly inhibited bacterial growth and it effectively blocked biofilm formation by A. pleuropneumoniae, Salmonella Typhymurium and Haemophilus parasuis in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, biofilm formation of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus suis was slightly inhibited by zinc. However, zinc did not disperse preformed biofilms. To determine whether zinc inhibits biofilm formation when poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PGA) is present, PGA was detected with the lectin wheat germ agglutinin. Only A. pleuropneumoniae and Staph. aureus biofilms were found to contain PGA. CONCLUSION: Zinc used at nonbactericidal concentrations can inhibit biofilm formation by several Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial swine pathogens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: The antibiofilm activity of zinc could provide a tool to fight biofilms, and the nonspecific inhibitory effect may well extend to other important human and animal bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Exacerbated type II interferon response drives hypervirulence and toxic shock by  an emergent epidemic strain of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis, a major porcine pathogen, can be transmitted to humans and cause severe symptoms. A large human outbreak associated with an unusual streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome (STSLS) was described in China. Albeit an early burst of proinflammatory cytokines following Chinese S. suis infection was suggested to be responsible for STSLS case severity, the mechanisms involved are still poorly understood. Using a mouse model, the host response to S. suis infection with a North American intermediately pathogenic strain, a European highly pathogenic strain, and the Chinese epidemic strain was investigated by a whole-genome microarray approach. Proinflammatory genes were expressed at higher levels in mice infected with the Chinese strain than those infected with the European strain. The Chinese strain induced a fast and strong gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) response by natural killer (NK) cells. In fact, IFN-gamma-knockout mice infected with the Chinese strain showed significantly better survival than wild-type mice. Conversely, infection with the less virulent North American strain resulted in an IFN-beta-subjugated, low inflammatory response that might be beneficial for the host to clear the infection. Overall, our data suggest that a highly virulent epidemic strain has evolved to massively activate IFN-gamma production, mainly by NK cells, leading to a rapid and lethal STSLS.
TI  - Evaluation on a Streptococcus suis vaccine using recombinant sao-l protein manufactured by bioreactors as the antigen in pigs.
AB  - Streptococcus suis (S. suis) can be classified into 33 serotypes based on the structure of capsular polysaccharides. Recent research indicated that a new surface protein designated as Sao (surface antigen one) reacts with 30 serotypes of convalescent-phase sera during S. suis infections, which makes Sao a good potential antigen for developing S. suis vaccines. The objectives of this study were to produce recombinant Sao-L protein (rSao-L) from a strain of S. suis serotype 2 by a prokaryotic expression system in bioreactors and to use rSao-L as the antigen for a S. suis vaccine in mouse and swine models. The antibody titres in mice and pigs immunized with rSao-L were significantly (P < 0.05) increased. After challenge with live S. suis serotype 1 bacteria, the anatomical lesions in pigs immunized with rSao-L were reduced by 60%. These data indicated that immunization with rSao-L can confer cross-serotype protection against S. suis. Moreover, percentages of CD8(+) and CD4(+) /CD8(+) double-positive T cells in immunized pigs were significantly higher than those of the control group (P < 0.01). Using bioreactors to produce rSao-L as the antigen for S. suis vaccines may broaden protective efficacy and reduce production costs.
TI  - Identification of a novel collagen type capital I, Ukrainian-binding protein from Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis, a major pathogen of pigs, is an emerging zoonotic agent that  causes meningitis and septic shock. cbp40 is a putative virulent gene that has been identified using suppression subtractive hybridization performed on the virulent S. suis serotype 2 strain HA9801 and the avirulent S. suis serotype 2 strain T15. Based on predicted protein features showing a shared conserved domain with the collagen-binding protein Cna of Staphylococcus aureus, Cbp40 is likely to function as a direct mediator of collagen adhesion. Here, the cbp40 gene was cloned and the recombinant protein purified. Western blotting using swine convalescent sera confirmed its role as an immunogenic protein. Collagen binding activity could be detected by western affinity blot and ELISA. Conversely, deletion of the cbp40 gene reduced bacterial adhesion to HEp-2 cells, capacity for biofilm formation, and virulence in a zebrafish infection model. The response of the bEnd.3 cell line to infection with the S. suis serotype 2 strain ZY05719 and the cbp40-knockout strain was evaluated using gene expression arrays. The differentially expressed genes were involved in inflammatory and immune responses, leukocyte adhesion and heterophilic cell adhesion. Collectively, these data suggest that Cbp40 plays an important role as an extracellular matrix adhesion protein that interacts with host cells during infection.
TI  - Proteome analysis of the two-component SalK/SalR system in Epidemic Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is a major swine pathogen of significant commercial importance worldwide and an emerging zoonotic agent of human streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome. We previously reported that the Chinese highly pathogenic SS2 strains specifically harbor an 89K pathogenicity island, and the SalK/SalR two-component system encoded within this island mediates a piglet-lethal phenotype. However, its regulatory mechanism remains obscure. In the present study, we performed a proteome analysis to identify the target proteins regulated by the SalK/SalR system. This expression profiling analysis reveals 14 down-regulated proteins and 1 up-regulated protein. In partial accord with our previous microarray analysis, 9 out of the 14 down-regulated genes are also repressed at the transcriptional level. From the 9 matched genes, 5 were selected and further subjected to gene knockout and experimental infection of mice. The results show that the selected 5 genes are potential virulence factors and participate to various extents in the pathogenesis of SS2 infection, and may contribute to the attenuation of virulence mediated by the SalK/SalR system.

TI  - Genetic analysis of capsular polysaccharide synthesis gene clusters from all serotypes of Streptococcus suis: potential mechanisms for generation of capsular variation.
AB  - Streptococcus suis strains are classified into 35 serotypes on the basis of the antigenicity of their capsular polysaccharides (CPs). CP synthesis genes are known to be clustered on the chromosome (cps gene cluster). The entire cps gene clusters of S. suis have so far been sequenced in 15 serotypes and found to be located between orfZ and aroA. In this study, to provide comprehensive information about S. suis CPs, we sequenced the entire cps gene clusters of the remaining serotypes and analyzed the complete set of S. suis cps gene clusters. Among the 35 cps gene clusters, 22 were located between orfZ and aroA, whereas the other 13 were flanked by other gene(s) on the chromosomes, and the chromosomal locus was classified into five patterns. By clustering analysis, the predicted products of cps genes found in the 35 serotypes were assigned into 291 homology groups, and all serotypes possessed a serotype-specific gene, except for serotypes 1, 2, 1/2, and 14. Because of the presence of genes encoding flippase (wzx) and polymerase (wzy), CPs of all serotypes were thought to be synthesized by the Wzx/Wzy pathway. Our data also implied the possibility of the transfer of the entire or partial cps gene clusters among S. suis strains, as well as the influence of spontaneous mutations in a single gene or a few genes on the antigenicity of some serotypes. Accumulation of these gene transfers and small-scale mutations may have generated the antigenic diversity of S. suis CPs.
TI  - Complete Genome Sequence of the Streptococcus suis Temperate Bacteriophage varphiNJ2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important cause of meningitis, arthritis, and sudden death in young piglets and of meningitis in humans. A novel temperate S. suis-specific bacteriophage (varphiNJ2) was identified. The phage was induced from the S. suis strain NJ2 by using mitomycin C, and the whole genome sequence was determined. The varphiNJ2 genome is 37,282 bp in length and contains 56 open reading frames (ORFs). While 31 ORFs (55%) encoded hypothetical proteins, other ORFs were predicted to be functional, clearly indicating the novelty of varphiNJ2.
TI  - Amperometric immunosensor for simultaneous detection of three analytes in one interface using dual functionalized graphene sheets integrated with redox-probes as tracer matrixes.
AB  - A novel immunoassay protocol for simultaneous electrochemical determination of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), carcinoembryonic (CEA) and streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) was designed. As standard sandwich-type immunoassay format, three primary antibodies (Ab1), anti-CEA and anti-AFP and anti-SS2, were immobilized via protein A (PA) adsorbed by Nafion modified electrodes, and functionalized graphene sheets (GS), containing abundant gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and carboxyl group, were used to immobilize secondary antibody@redox-probe so as to act as tracer. Concentration of each analyte was quantitatively related to the reduction peak current of corresponding redox-probe in differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) scan. The resulting immunosensor exhibited high selectivity and sensitivity in simultaneous determination of three analytes. The linear range was from 0.016 to 50 ng/mL for AFP with a detection limit of 5.4 pg/mL, 0.010 to 50 ng/mL for CEA with a detection limit of 2.8 pg/mL and 0.012 to 50 ng/mL for SS2 with a detection limit of 4.2 pg/mL (S/N=3).

TI  - Lysogenic Streptococcus suis isolate SS2-4 containing prophage SMP showed increased mortality in zebra fish compared to the wild-type isolate.
AB  - Streptococcus suis (S. suis) infection is considered to be a major problem in the swine industry worldwide. Based on the capsular type, 33 serotypes of S. suis have been described, with serotype 2 (SS2) being the most frequently isolated from diseased piglets. Little is known, however, about the pathogenesis and virulence factors of S. suis. Research on bacteriophages highlights a new area in S. suis research. A S. suis serotype 2 bacteriophage, designated SMP, has been previously isolated in our laboratory. Here, we selected a lysogenic isolate in which the SMP phage was integrated into the chromosome of strain SS2-4. Compared to the wild-type isolate, the lysogenic strain showed increased mortality in zebra fish. Moreover the sensitivity of the lysogenic strain to lysozyme was seven times higher than that of the wild-type.

TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility, tetracycline and erythromycin resistance genes, and multilocus sequence typing of Streptococcus suis isolates from diseased pigs in China.
AB  - Streptococcus suis (S. suis) is an emerging zoonotic pathogen causing significant economic losses in the swine industry. Here, we investigated the antimicrobial susceptibility, associated antibiotic-resistant determinants and sequence type (ST) of S. suis isolates from diseased pigs in China from 2008 to 2010. Serotype 2 was the most frequently observed strain (n=95) among the 106 S. suis strains collected, followed by serotypes 3 (n=3), 5 (n=3), 4 (n=2), 7 (n=1), 11 (n=1) and 28 (n=1). Multilocus sequence typing analysis revealed that ST1 (n=21) and ST7 (n=74) were the predominant STs, and serotype 2 was found to be significantly correlated with ST7 (P=0.017, Fisher's exact test) and CC1 (P=0.024, Fisher's exact test). The antimicrobial susceptibility results indicated that the antibiotic resistance rate was highest for tetracycline (99.1%), followed by azithromycin (68.9%), erythromycin (67.9%), clindamycin (67.9%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (16%), levofloxacin (2.8%), chloramphenicol (1.9%), cefaclor (0.9%) and ceftriaxone (0.9%). Antibiotic-resistant genes tet(M), tet(O), tet(O/W/32/O), tet(O/32/O), tet(S), tet(W), tet(L), tet(40), erm(B), mef(A/E) and msr(D) could be detected, and several tandem organizations of antibiotic resistance genes were also found in this study. In conclusion, S. suis strains isolated from diseased pigs in China were less diverse and multi-drug resistant.

TI  - Optimized protocol for multiplex nested polymerase chain reaction to detect and differentiate Haemophilus parasuis, Streptococcus suis, and Mycoplasma hyorhinis in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from pigs with polyserositis.
AB  - An optimized protocol was developed for the simultaneous detection and differentiation of Haemophilus parasuis, Streptococcus suis, and Mycoplasma hyorhinis in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues with multiplex nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This method also determines the prevalence of these bacteria in pigs with polyserositis. DNA extraction with a combination of a commercial reagent and proteinase K resulted in more frequent detection of the pathogens than DNA extraction with proteinase K alone. Among FFPE tissue samples from 312 cases of polyserositis in which at least 1 bacterial species was detected, multiplex nested PCR detected H. parasuis in 239 (77%), S. suis in 124 (40%), and M. hyorhinis in 40 (13%). The disease was caused by a single pathogen in 224 (72%) of the cases and multiple pathogens in 88 (28%). Among the pigs positive for H. parasuis, S. suis, and M. hyorhinis by multiplex nested PCR, the pathogen was isolated from only 11%, 35%, and 28%, respectively. Therefore, the PCR protocol developed in this study is a useful diagnostic method when samples are negative after isolation methods and even for samples in which only 1 pathogen was isolated.
TI  - An ultrasensitive peroxydisulfate electrochemiluminescence immunosensor for Streptococcus suis serotype 2 based on L-cysteine combined with mimicking bi-enzyme synergetic catalysis to in situ generate coreactant.
AB  - A novel signal amplification strategy of mimicking bi-enzyme synergetic catalysis to generate coreactant in situ was designed to fabricate an ultrasensitive peroxydisulfate electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunosensor for detection of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2). It was the first time to detect SS2 by using ECL. Through the interaction between l-cysteine (l-cys) and hollow PtPd bimetal alloy nanoparticles (HPtPd) to form ((l-cys-HPtPd)n) nanocomposites, the loading amount of l-cys and HPtPd was greatly increased, which could greatly enhance the ECL signal of peroxydisulfate. At the same time, Glucose Oxidase (GOD), used to block nonspecific binding sites of (l-cys-HPtPd)n nanocomposites, could rapidly oxidize d-glucose in the detection solution into gluconic acid accompanying with the generation of H2O2, which was further catalyzed by HPtPd to generate O2. And O2, acted as the coreactant of peroxydisulfate, could greatly amplify the ECL signal. In the process, HPtPd could be regarded as mimicking enzyme, the effect of which was similar to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in generating O2. With the several amplification factors of a sandwich-type structure we designed, a wide linear ranged from 0.0001 to 100ngmL(-1) was acquired with a relatively low detection limit of 33fgmL(-1) for SS2. The present work demonstrated that the novel strategy had the great advantages in sensitivity, selectivity and reproducibility which might hold a new promise for highly sensitive bioassays applied in clinical detection.
TI  - Bacteraemias in tropical Australia: changing trends over a 10-year period.
AB  - Bacteraemia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. This is the largest reported study of bacteraemias in Australia. The presence of organisms endemic to the tropical region and the changing trends described have significant implications for empirical antibiotic therapy. This retrospective study examined 8976 blood cultures from Townsville Hospital, a regional Australian hospital located in the tropics over a 10-year period. The rate of bacteraemic episodes during the study period was 10.12 per 1000 admissions. Intravenous devices (18.7%), immunosuppressive therapy (16.1%), and urinary tract infections (16.1%) were important sources for bacteraemia. The most common organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (20.9%) and Escherichia. coli (15.6%). A significant reduction was observed in S. aureus susceptibility to clindamycin (P < 0.05) and in E. coli susceptibility to gentamicin. Organisms isolated that were of relevance to the tropics of Australia included Burkholderia pseudomallei, Group A streptococcus, and Brucella suis.
TI  - Catabolite control protein A of Streptococcus suis type 2 contributes to sugar metabolism and virulence.
AB  - Catabolite control protein A (CcpA) is the major transcriptional regulator in carbon catabolite repression in several Gram-positive bacteria. We attempted to characterize the role of a CcpA homologue of Streptococcus suis type 2 in sugar metabolism and virulence. Addition of glucose or sucrose to the defined medium significantly reduced the activity of raffinose-inducible alpha-galactosidase, cellobiose-inducible beta-glucosidase, and maltose-inducible alpha-glucosidase of the wild-type strain by about 9, 4, and 2-3 fold, respectively. Deletion of ccpA substantially derepressed the effects of repressing sugars on alpha-galactosidase or beta-glucosidase activity. The ccpA deletion mutant showed reduced expression of virulence genes sly and eno (P<0.05), decreased adhesion to and invasion into endothelial cells (P<0.05), and attenuated virulence to mice with significant reduction of death rate and bacterial burden in organs, as compared to the wild-type strain. Both the in vitro and in vivo defect phenotypes were reversible by ccpA complementation. Thus, this study shows that CcpA of S. suis type 2 plays an important role in carbon catabolite repression and virulence.
TI  - Bacterial Adhesion of Streptococcus suis to Host Cells and Its Inhibition by Carbohydrate Ligands.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is a Gram-positive bacterium, which causes sepsis and meningitis in pigs and humans. This review examines the role of known S. suis virulence factors in adhesion and S. suis carbohydrate-based adhesion mechanisms, as well as the inhibition of S. suis adhesion by anti-adhesion compounds in in vitro assays. Carbohydrate-binding specificities of S. suis have been identified, and these studies have shown that many strains recognize Galalpha1-4Gal-containing oligosaccharides present in host glycolipids. In the era of increasing antibiotic resistance, new means to treat infections are needed. Since microbial adhesion to carbohydrates is important to establish disease, compounds blocking adhesion could be an alternative to antibiotics. The use of oligosaccharides as drugs is generally hampered by their relatively low affinity (micromolar) to compete with multivalent binding to host receptors. However, screening of a library of chemically modified Galalpha1-4Gal derivatives has identified compounds that inhibit S. suis adhesion in nanomolar range. Also, design of multivalent Galalpha1-4Gal-containing dendrimers has resulted in a significant increase of the inhibitory potency of the disaccharide. The S. suis adhesin binding to Galalpha1-4Gal-oligosaccharides, Streptococcal adhesin P (SadP), was recently identified. It has a Galalpha1-4Gal-binding N-terminal domain and a C-terminal LPNTG-motif for cell wall anchoring. The carbohydrate-binding domain has no homology to E. coli P fimbrial adhesin, which suggests that these Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial adhesins recognizing the same receptor have evolved by convergent evolution. SadP adhesin may represent a promising target for the design of anti-adhesion ligands for the prevention and treatment of S. suis infections.

AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important swine pathogen associated with a variety of infections such as meningitis, arthritis and septicemia. The bacterium is zoonotic and has been found to cause meningitis especially in humans occupationally exposed to infected pigs. Since adhesion is a prerequisite for colonization and subsequent infection, anti-adhesion treatment seems a natural alternative to traditional treatment with antibiotics. In order to optimize the inhibitory potency a multivalency approach was taken in the inhibitor design. A synthetic tetravalent galabiose compound was chosen which had previously shown promising anti-adhesion effects with S. suis in vitro. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vivo effects of the compound using an infection peritonitis mouse model. As such S. suis serotype 2 infection and treatment were tested in vivo and the effects were compared to the effect of treatment with penicillin.
TI  - Clinical resistance and decreased susceptibility in Streptococcus suis isolates from clinically healthy fattening pigs.
AB  - Streptococcus suis (S. suis) has often been reported as an important swine pathogen and is considered as a new emerging zoonotic agent. Consequently, it is important to be informed on its susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. In the current study, the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) population distribution of nine antimicrobial agents has been determined for nasal S. suis strains, isolated from healthy pigs at the end of the fattening period from 50 closed or semiclosed pig herds. The aim of the study was to report resistance based on both clinical breakpoints (clinical resistance percentage) and epidemiological cutoff values (non-wild-type percentage). Non-wild-type percentages were high for tetracycline (98%), lincomycin (92%), tilmicosin (72%), erythromycin (70%), tylosin (66%), and low for florfenicol (0%) and enrofloxacin (0.3%). Clinical resistance percentages were high for tetracycline (95%), erythromycin (66%), tylosin (66%), and low for florfenicol (0.3%) and enrofloxacin (0.3%). For tiamulin, for which no clinical breakpoint is available, 57% of the isolates did not belong to the wild-type population. Clinical resistance and non-wild-type percentages differed substantially for penicillin. Only 1% of the tested S. suis strains was considered as clinically resistant, whereas 47% of the strains showed acquired resistance when epidemiological cutoff values were used. In conclusion, MIC values for penicillin are gradually increasing, compared to previous reports, although pigs infected with strains showing higher MICs may still respond to treatment with penicillin. The high rate of acquired resistance against tiamulin has not been reported before. Results from this study clearly demonstrate that the use of different interpretive criteria contributes to the extent of differences in reported antimicrobial resistance results. The early detection of small changes in the MIC population distribution of isolates, while clinical failure may not yet be observed, provides the opportunity to implement appropriate risk management steps.
TI  - Reappraisal of the taxonomy of Streptococcus suis serotypes 20, 22, 26, and 33 based on DNA-DNA homology and sodA and recN phylogenies.
AB  - To date, Streptococcus suis was divided into thirty-three serotypes based on its  polysaccharide capsular antigens. Although 16S rRNA sequence similarities of serotypes 20, 22, 26, and 33 reference strains to the type strain NCTC 10234(T) were below the threshold value of 98.5% to assign them to S. suis species, no strong evidence support to reclassification. Here, their taxonomic identities were determined by DNA-DNA hybridization assays and by partial sequencing of the sodA and recN genes. Our results confirmed that the serotype 20, 22, 26, and 33 reference strains were distantly related to the type strain NCTC 10234(T) and the whole sequence strain P1/7 of S. suis. Moreover, the reference strains of serotypes 20, 22, and 26 were closely related to each other but distinct from the serotype 33 reference strain. Sequencing analyses of sodA and recN of a total 33 serotype reference strains showed that the serotype 20, 22, and 26 reference strains and the serotype 33 reference strain did not fall with not only other serotypes of S. suis, but also other streptococcal species (63 strains of 56 species for sodA and 87 strains of 55 species for recN). The evidence further substantiates the view that the reference strains of serotypes 20, 22, 26 and 33 should be taxonomically removed from S. suis, although their taxonomic designations and determinative phenotypic characteristics are yet to be addressed.
TI  - Identification of a novel host-specific IgM protease in Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is a highly invasive, extracellular pathogen in pigs with the capacity to cause severe infections in humans. This study was initiated by the finding that IgM degradation products are released after opsonization of S. suis. The objective of this work was to identify the bacterial factor responsible for IgM degradation. The results of this study showed that a member of the IdeS family, designated Ide(Ssuis) (Immunoglobulin M-degrading enzyme of S. suis), is responsible and sufficient for IgM cleavage. Recombinant Ide(Ssuis) was found to degrade only IgM but neither IgG nor IgA. Interestingly, Western blot analysis revealed that Ide(Ssuis) is host specific, as it exclusively cleaves porcine IgM but not IgM from six other species, including a closely related member of the Suidae family. As demonstrated by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy, Ide(Ssuis) modulates binding of IgM to the bacterial surface. Ide(Ssuis) is the first prokaryotic IgM-specific protease described, indicating that this enzyme is involved in a so-far-unknown mechanism of host-pathogen interaction at an early stage of the host immune response. Furthermore, cleavage of porcine IgM by Ide(Ssuis) is the first identified phenotype reflecting functional adaptation of S. suis to pigs as the main host.
TI  - Meningitis caused by an unusual genotype (ST3) of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - We describe a case of meningitis due to Streptococcus suis with the unusual ST3 genotype. The bacterial pathogen was isolated from blood samples. S. suis genotype ST3 was initially isolated from carrier pigs, but it has not been previously associated with invasive human infections. The patient developed serious endogenous bilateral endophthalmitis which resulted in severe visual deficiency.
TI  - Common regulators of virulence in streptococci.
AB  - Streptococcal species are a diverse group of bacteria which can be found in animals and humans. Their interactions with host organisms can vary from commensal to pathogenic. Many of the pathogenic species are causative agents of severe, invasive infections in their hosts, accounting for a high burden of morbidity and mortality, associated with high economic costs in industry and health care. Among them, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus suis are discussed here. An environmentally stimulated and tightly controlled expression of their virulence factors is of utmost importance for their pathogenic potential. Thus, the most universal and widespread regulators from the classes of stand-alone transcriptional regulators, two-component signal transduction systems (TCS), eukaryotic-like serine/threonine kinases, and small noncoding RNAs are the topic of this chapter. The regulatory levels are reviewed with respect to function, activity, and their role in pathogenesis. Understanding of and interfering with transcriptional regulation mechanisms and networks is a promising basis for the development of novel anti-infective therapies.
TI  - HP0197 contributes to CPS synthesis and the virulence of Streptococcus suis via CcpA.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2), a major swine pathogen and an emerging zoonotic agent, has greatly challenged global public health. The encoding proteins with unknown functions the bacterium encodes are an obstruction to studies of the pathogenesis. A novel surface protective antigen HP0197 is one of these proteins which have no sequence homology to any known protein. In the present study, the protein was determined to be involved in bacterial virulence through an evaluation of the isogenic mutant (Deltahp0197) in both mice and pigs. The experimental infection also indicated that Deltahp0197 could be cleared easily during infection, which could be attributed to the reduced thickness of the capsular polysaccharides (CPS) and the significantly reduced phagocytotic resistance. Microarrays-based comparative transcriptome analysis suggested that the suppressed expression of the operon responsible for CPS synthesis might be reversed by CcpA activity, which controlled global regulation of carbon catabolite through the binding of the CcpA and HPr-Ser-46-P to the catabolite-responsive elements (cre) of the target operons. The hypothesis was approved by the fact that the purified FLAG-tagged HPr from WT stain exhibited a higher binding activity to cre with CcpA compared to the Deltahp0197 by the Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay, suggesting lower level of phosphorylation of the phosphocarrier protein HPr at residue Ser-46 (HPr-Ser-46P) in Deltahp0197. These indicated that HP0197 could enhance CcpA activity to control the expression of genes involved in carbohydrate utilization and CPS synthesis, thus contributing to the virulence of S. suis.
TI  - Characterization of Streptococcus suis isolates from slaughter swine.
AB  - The characterization of 61 Streptococcus suis strains isolated from Chinese slaughter pigs was investigated. S. suis serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 22, 23, 25, 26, 28, 29, and 1/2 were found in the isolates by serum agglutination. Of all the prevalent serotypes, S. suis serotype 7 is the most predominant circulating in Chinese slaughter pigs. The virulence-associated genes profile and multilocus sequence typing scheme of the isolates were analyzed. The mrp-/epf-/sly- virulence-associated genes type is the most prevalent in the isolates from slaughter pigs. It is the first time to find S. suis serotypes 7 and 9 isolates with epf. The serotypes 7 and 9 isolates with mrp and/or epf genes did not express MRP and/or EF in the present research. Thirteen new ST types were identified for the first time. ST1 complex and ST27 complex of S. suis are prevalent in China. This paper supplied information to understand the characteristics, such as capsular serotypes, virulence factors, and gene backgrounds of S. suis carried by slaughter pigs.
TI  - Human meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important swine pathogen worldwide, which can be transmitted to human beings by direct contact; therefore, S. suis infections occur mainly in people who handle pigs or pork. We present a case of a patient with S. suis meningitis who worked as a butcher in a meat processing plant for 5 years. The 35-year-old man was admitted to the Department of Infectious Diseases in T. Browicz Memorial Central Infectious Disease and Observation Hospital in Bydgoszcz, Poland, with suspected bacterial meningitis. According to his medical history, the patient had been injured during the processing of pork. A microbiological examination of the cerebrospinal fluid and blood revealed S. suis as a single aetiological factor of this infection. The patient was empirically administered cefotaxime (2.0 g at 8-h intervals) and penicillin (9 million U at 8-h intervals). The patient made a complete recovery and his inflammatory markers normalized. Only the hearing deficit of his right ear did not disappear. An otolaryngologist recommended a 4-week steroid therapy. The patient was not examined because he did not report to the clinic. To our knowledge this is the first described case of human meningitis caused by S. suis in Poland.
TI  - Evaluation of the pathogenesis of meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis sequence type 7 using the infection of BV2 microglial cells.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important agent of swine and human meningitis. Among several sequence types (STs) characterized within the S. suis strain population, ST7 has emerged only in China and has been reported to be the cause of the human outbreak caused by S. suis in 2005. S. suis ST7 was shown to be derived from S. suis ST1 through a single-nucleotide change in the housekeeping gene thyA. The virulence potential of S. suis ST7 is reported to be higher than that of the worldwide-studied pathogenic S. suis ST1. The pathogenesis of ST1 infection has been partially elucidated, but information on the pathogenesis of ST7 infections remains scarce. To improve our understanding of the mechanisms involved in the development of meningitis caused by ST7, this study compared the microglial inflammatory response induced by ST1 and ST7 strains. The data showed that S. suis ST7 possessed a higher ability to induce pro-inflammatory cytokine production and to activate mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways and several transcription factors. The stimulation of microglial cells by S. suis increased the expression levels of the nucleotide oligomerization domain 2 (Nod2) gene. Finally, the results indicated that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT-3) was involved in the development of meningitis induced by S. suis ST7 infection.
TI  - Epidemiology and pathogenicity of zoonotic streptococci.
AB  - Zoonotic infections caused by Streptococcus spp. have been neglected in spite of  the fact that frequency and severity of outbreaks increased dramatically in recent years. This may be due to non-identification since respective species are often not considered in human medical diagnostic procedures. On the other hand, an expanding human population concomitant with an increasing demand for food and the increased number of companion animals favour conditions for host species adaptation of animal streptococci. This review aims to give an overview on streptococcal zoonoses with focus on epidemiology and pathogenicity of four major zoonotic species, Streptococcus canis, Streptococcus equi sub. zooepidemicus, Streptococcus iniae and Streptococcus suis.
TI  - Molecular mechanism by which surface antigen HP0197 mediates host cell attachment in the pathogenic bacteria Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis, one of the most important and prevalent pathogens in swine, presents a major challenge to global public health. HP0197 is an S. suis surface antigen that was previously identified by immunoproteomics and can bind to the host cell surface. Here, we investigated the interaction between HP0197 and the host cell surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) using indirect immunofluorescence and cell adhesion inhibition assays. In addition, we determined that a novel 18-kDa domain in the N-terminal region of HP0197 functions as the GAG-binding domain. We then solved the three-dimensional structures of the N-terminal 18-kDa and C-terminal G5 domains using x-ray crystallography. Based on this structural information, the GAG-binding sites in HP0197 were predicted and subsequently verified using site-directed mutagenesis and indirect immunofluorescence. The results indicate that the positively charged residues on the exposed surface of the 18-kDa domain, which are primarily lysines, likely play a critical role in the HP0197-heparin interaction that mediates bacterium-host cell adhesion. Understanding this molecular mechanism may provide a basis for the development of effective drugs and therapeutic strategies for treating streptococcal infections.
TI  - Characterization of Streptococcus suis isolates recovered between 2008 and 2011 from diseased pigs in Quebec, Canada.
AB  - In the present study we report the distribution of different serotypes of Streptococcus suis among strains isolated from diseased pigs in Quebec, Canada, recovered between 2008 and 2011. Serotype 2 strains were further studied for the presence of the following virulence markers: suilysin (sly), muramidase-released protein (MRP), extracellular protein factor (epf) and the pilus encoded by the srtF cluster. Of 1004 field strains collected, 986 were confirmed to be S. suis by either the species-specific PCR targeting the gdh gene or by 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis. Results showed that, although widely used, the species-specific PCR test can sometimes be misleading and fail to correctly identify some S. suis isolates. Serotypes 2, 3, 1/2, 4, 8 and 22 together represented 51% of S. suis strains (64.5% of typable strains). Results confirmed the relatively low prevalence of serotype 2 in North America, when compared to European and Asian countries. The vast majority of serotype 2 field strains (96%) belong to either the MRP(+), srtF pilus(+), epf(-), sly(-) (52%) or the MRP(-), srtF pilus(-), epf(-), sly(-) phenotypes (44%). Most non-typable strains (89%) presented high surface hydrophobicity, suggesting that these are poorly or non-encapsulated. Electron microscopy studies confirmed the lack of capsular polysaccharide in selected non-typable high hydrophobic strains. The role and pathogenesis of the infection caused by these strains remain to be elucidated.
TI  - A Case of Streptococcus suis Infection Causing Pneumonia with Empyema in Korea.
AB  - Streptococcus suis causes meningitis and sepsis in pigs, but human infection has  increased over the past few years in those who are exposed to pigs or raw pork. Most cases have occurred in Southeast Asia, but only two cases have been reported in South Korea, presenting with arthritis and meningitis. Here, we report a rare case of S. suis infection, a 60-year-old sailor, who visited the emergency room presenting septicemia, pneumonia with empyema and meningitis, showed full recovery; however, neurologic sequale of severe cognitive dysfunction was present after the usage of antibiotics and percutaneous drainage. S. suis was isolated from blood and pleural fluid and the strain was susceptible to penicillin and vancomycin. Increased awareness of S. suis infection and prevention are warranted.
TI  - PulseNet China, a model for future laboratory-based bacterial infectious disease  surveillance in China.
AB  - Surveillance is critical for the prevention and control of infectious disease. China's real-time web-based infectious disease reporting system is a distinguished achievement. However, many aspects of the current China Infectious Disease Surveillance System do not yet meet the demand for timely outbreak detection and identification of emerging infectious disease. PulseNet, the national molecular typing network for foodborne disease surveillance was first established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States in 1995 and has proven valuable in the early detection of outbreaks and tracing the pathogen source. Since 2001, the China CDC laboratory for bacterial pathogen analysis has been a member of the PulseNet International family; and has been adapting the idea and methodology of PulseNet to develop a model for a future national laboratory-based surveillance system for all bacterial infectious disease.We summarized the development progress for the PulseNet China system and discussed it as a model for the future of China's national laboratory-based surveillance system.
TI  - Macedovicin, the second food-grade lantibiotic produced by Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198.
AB  - Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198 was found to produce a second lantibiotic named macedovicin in addition to macedocin. Macedovicin was purified to homogeneity and mass spectrometric analysis identified a peptide of approximately 3.4 kDa. Partial N-terminal sequence analysis and tandem mass spectrometry revealed that macedovicin was identical to bovicin HJ50 and thermophilin 1277 produced by Streptococcus bovis and Streptococcus thermophilus, respectively. Macedovicin inhibits a broad spectrum of lactic acid bacteria, several food spoilage species (e.g. Clostridium spp.) and oral streptococci. We determined the complete biosynthetic gene cluster of macedovicin. Even though the gene clusters of macedovicin, thermophilin 1277 and bovicin HJ50 were almost identical at the nucleotide level, there were important differences in their predicted genes and proteins. Bovicin HJ50-like lantibiotics were also found to be encoded by Streptococcus suis strains SC84 and D12, Enterococcus columbae PLCH2, Clostridium perfringens JGS1721 and several Bacillus strains. All these lantibiotics contained a number of conserved amino acids that may be important for their biosynthesis and activity, while phylogenetic analysis supported their dispersion by horizontal gene transfer. In conclusion, the production of multiple bacteriocins may enhance the bio-protective potential of S. macedonicus during food fermentation.
TI  - [Streptococcus suis meningitis in a meat factory employee].
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the Netherlands, Streptococcus suis is a rare cause of meningitis. Over the past few years, the number of reported cases worldwide has increased. The bacterium is mainly isolated in pigs, but humans can also become infected. CASE DESCRIPTION: At the Emergency Department, a 60-year-old man presented with headache, confusion, fever and nuchal rigidity. He worked at a meat factory. Laboratory testing showed abnormalities linked to bacterial meningitis. S. suis was cultured from blood and cerebrospinal fluid. The patient was treated with dexamethasone, ceftriaxone and later benzylpenicillin intravenously. He recovered well, but had bilateral perceptive hearing loss as a sequela. CONCLUSION: Particularly people who are in close contact with pigs have an increased risk of S. suis infection. S. suis meningitis can be very severe and lead to serious complications and even death. Rapid diagnosis and adequate treatment are critical. Permanent hearing loss is the most frequent sequela.
TI  - Genome sequence of the swine pathogen Streptococcus suis serotype 2 strain S735.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is a major swine pathogen responsible for significant, worldwide economic losses in the swine industry, in addition to being an emerging zoonotic agent. Strains of serotype 2 are the most commonly associated with infections causing meningitis, endocarditis, and septicemia. Here we present the genome sequence of S. suis serotype 2 strain S735.
TI  - An octamer of enolase from Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Enolase is a conserved cytoplasmic metalloenzyme existing universally in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. The enzyme can also locate on the cell surface and bind to plasminogen, via which contributing to the mucosal surface localization of the bacterial pathogens and assisting the invasion into the host cells. The functions of the eukaryotic enzymes on the cell surface expression (including T cells, B cells, neutrophils, monocytoes, neuronal cells and epithelial cells) are not known. Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S. suis 2, SS2) is an important zoonotic pathogen which has recently caused two large-scale outbreaks in southern China with severe streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) never seen before in human sufferers. We recently identified the SS2 enolase as an important protective antigen which could protect mice from fatal S.suis 2 infection. In this study, a 2.4-angstrom structure of the SS2 enolase is solved, revealing an octameric arrangement in the crystal. We further demonstrated that the enzyme exists exclusively as an octamer in solution via a sedimentation assay. These results indicate that the octamer is the biological unit of SS2 enolase at least in vitro and most likely in vivo as well. This is, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive characterization of the SS2 enolase octamer both structurally and biophysically, and the second octamer enolase structure in addition to that of Streptococcus pneumoniae. We also investigated the plasminogen binding property of the SS2 enzyme.
TI  - Attenuation of Streptococcus suis virulence by the alteration of bacterial surface architecture.
AB  - NeuB, a sialic acid synthase catalyzes the last committed step of the de novo biosynthetic pathway of sialic acid, a major element of bacterial surface structure. Here we report a functional NeuB homologue of Streptococcus suis, a zoonotic agent, and systematically address its molecular and immunological role in bacterial virulence. Disruption of neuB led to thinner capsules and more susceptibility to pH, and cps2B inactivation resulted in complete absence of capsular polysaccharides. These two mutants both exhibited increased adhesion and invasion to Hep-2 cells and improved sensibility to phagocytosis. Not only do they retain the capability of inducing the release of host pro-inflammatory cytokines, but also result in the faster secretion of IL-8. Easier cleaning up of the mutant strains in whole blood is consistent with virulence attenuation seen with experimental infections of both mice and SPF-piglets. Therefore we concluded that altered architecture of S. suis surface attenuates its virulence.
TI  - Occurrence and evolution of the paralogous zinc metalloproteases IgA1 protease, ZmpB, ZmpC, and ZmpD in Streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  - The distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, IgA1 protease, ZmpB, ZmpC, and ZmpD, in Streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. ZmpB was ubiquitous in the Mitis and Salivarius groups of the genus Streptococcus and in the genera Gemella and Granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented gene in Streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. IgA1 protease activity was observed in all members of S. pneumoniae, S. pseudopneumoniae, S. oralis, S. sanguinis, and Gemella haemolysans, was variably present in S. mitis and S. infantis, and absent in S. gordonii, S. parasanguinis, S. cristatus, S. oligofermentans, S. australis, S. peroris, and S. suis. Phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpB, and zmpD genes in S. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. Presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. The widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpB, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. IMPORTANCE: The paralogous zinc metalloproteases IgA1 protease, ZmpB, ZmpC, and ZmpD have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. This study maps the presence of the corresponding genes and enzyme activities in S. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera Streptococcus, Gemella, and Granulicatella. The distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpB is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. The ZmpB protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the Mitis and Salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in Streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. The relative sequence diversification of the IgA1 protease, ZmpB, and ZmpD is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen S. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.
TI  - A novel fibronectin-binding protein of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 contributes  to epithelial cell invasion and in vivo dissemination.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is an important pathogen with zoonotic potential. In this study, a novel in vivo induced protein Ssa, encoded by the functionally unknown gene SSU05_1311, was identified as a surface anchored fibronectin-binding protein. The recombinant Ssa as well as its truncated proteins harboring the N-terminal domain (residues 33-153) could bind to human fibronectin with high-affinity. Isogenic knockout of ssa in SS2 led to decrease of bacterial binding to immobilized fibronectin. SS2 Deltassa mutant showed reduced adherence and invasion of human pharyngeal epithelial (HEp-2) cells compared to the wild type strain. Heterologous surface display of Ssa fibronectin-binding domain in Escherichia coli enhanced the bacterial attachment and entry to HEp-2 cells. Less SS2 Deltassa mutants than the wild type strain were recovered from the blood and brains of the Balb/c mice infected intranasally. But there was no significant difference between the wild type and the mutant on phagocytosis by macrophages (RAW264.7) and bacterial killing by murine PMNs under opsonizing condition. Our data suggest that Ssa is an important virulence factor for SS2 crossing the mucosal epithelia to disseminate in vivo.
TI  - Immune receptors involved in Streptococcus suis recognition by dendritic cells.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important swine pathogen and an emerging zoonotic agent  of septicemia and meningitis. Knowledge on host immune responses towards S. suis, and strategies used by this pathogen for subversion of these responses is scarce. The objective of this study was to identify the immune receptors involved in S. suis recognition by dendritic cells (DCs). Production of cytokines and expression of co-stimulatory molecules by DCs were shown to strongly rely on MyD88-dependent signaling pathways, suggesting that DCs recognize S. suis and become activated mostly through Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. Supporting this fact, TLR2(-/-) DCs were severely impaired in the release of several cytokines and the surface expression of CD86 and MHC-II. The release of IL-12p70 and CXC10, and the expression of CD40 were found to depend on signaling by both TLR2 and TLR9. The release of IL-23 and CXCL1 were partially dependent on NOD2. Finally, despite the fact that MyD88 signaling was crucial for DC activation and maturation, MyD88-dependent pathways were not implicated in S. suis internalization by DCs. This first study on receptors involved in DC activation by S. suis suggests a major involvement of MyD88 signaling pathways, mainly (but not exclusively) through TLR2. A multimodal recognition involving a combination of different receptors seems essential for DC effective response to S. suis.
TI  - The spectrum of central nervous system infections in an adult referral hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine prospectively the causative pathogens of central nervous system (CNS) infections in patients admitted to a tertiary referral hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam. METHODS: From May 2007 to December 2008, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 352 adults with suspected meningitis or encephalitis underwent routine testing, staining (Gram, Ziehl-Nielsen, India ink), bacterial culture and polymerase chain reaction targeting Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. suis, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Herpes simplex virus (HSV), Varicella Zoster virus (VZV), enterovirus, and 16S ribosomal RNA. Blood cultures and clinically indicated radiology were also performed. Patients were classified as having confirmed or suspected bacterial (BM), tuberculous (TBM), cryptococcal (CRM), eosinophilic (EOM) meningitis, aseptic encephalitis/meningitis (AEM), neurocysticercosis and others. RESULTS: 352 (male: 66%) patients were recruited: median age 34 years (range 13-85). 95/352 (27.3%) diagnoses were laboratory confirmed and one by cranial radiology: BM (n = 62), TBM (n = 9), AEM (n = 19), CRM (n = 5), and neurocysticercosis (n = 1, cranial radiology). S. suis predominated as the cause of BM [48/62 (77.4%)]; Listeria monocytogenese (n = 1), S. pasteurianus (n = 1) and N. meningitidis (n = 2) were infrequent. AEM viruses were: HSV (n = 12), VZV (n = 5) and enterovirus (n = 2). 5 patients had EOM. Of 262/352 (74.4%) patients with full clinical data, 209 (79.8%) were hospital referrals and 186 (71%) had been on antimicrobials. 21 (8%) patients died: TBM (15.2%), AEM (10%), and BM (2.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Most infections lacked microbiological confirmation. S. suis was the most common cause of BM in this setting. Improved diagnostics are needed for meningoencephalitic syndromes to inform treatment and prevention strategies.
TI  - Interspecies mobilization of an ermT-carrying plasmid of Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis by a coresident ICE of the ICESa2603 family.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The recently documented presence of almost identical, small, non-self-transmissible, erm(T)-carrying plasmids in clonally unrelated erythromycin-resistant isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae suggests that these plasmids somehow circulate in the streptococcal population. The objective of this study was to characterize the erm(T)-carrying genetic element in a clinical isolate of Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (Sde5580) and to provide a possible explanation for the spread of erm(T)-carrying plasmids in streptococci. METHODS: The erm(T)-carrying element of Sde5580 was investigated by plasmid analysis, PCR experiments and sequencing. Transfer and retransfer experiments were performed using S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae and Streptococcus suis strains as recipients and by selection in the presence of suitable drug concentrations. Transconjugants were analysed by SmaI-macrorestriction analysis. Genetic studies also included PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis using HindIII endonuclease. RESULTS: Sde5580 contained two mobile genetic elements: a 4950 bp erm(T)-carrying plasmid (p5580) almost identical to the non-self-transmissible erm(T)-carrying plasmids of S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae mentioned above, and an ~63 kb cadC/cadA-carrying integrative and conjugative element (ICESde3396-like) of the ICESa2603 family. p5580 was transferable at high frequency to the recipients of all three species through in trans mobilization by the coresident ICESde3396-like element. p5580 and ICESde3396-like were able to be transferred either separately or together. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first evidence of horizontal transfer of an erm(T)-carrying plasmid between streptococci. In trans mobilization by coresident ICEs may be one mechanism for the spread of erm(T)-carrying plasmids in the streptococcal population.
TI  - Development of a single-tube loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for detection of four pathogens of bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Several loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays have been developed  to detect common causative pathogens of bacterial meningitis (BM). However, no LAMP assay is reported to detect Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus suis, which are also among common pathogens of BM. Moreover, it is laborious and expensive by performing multiple reactions for each sample to detect bacterial pathogen. Thus, we aimed to design and develop a single-tube LAMP assay capable of detecting multiple bacterial species, based on the nucleotide sequences of the 16S rRNA genes of the bacteria. The nucleotide sequences of the 16S rRNA genes of main pathogens involved in BM were aligned to identify conserved regions, which were further used to design broad range specific LAMP assay primers. We successfully designed a set of broad range specific LAMP assay primers for simultaneous detection of four species including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. suis and S. agalactiae. The broad range LAMP assay was highly specific without cross-reactivity with other bacteria including Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and Escherichia coli. The sensitivity of our LAMP assay was 100-1000 times higher compared with the conventional PCR assay. The bacterial species could be identified after digestion of the LAMP products with restriction endonuclease DdeI and HaeIII.
TI  - Identifying associations between pig pathologies using a multi-dimensional machine learning methodology.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Abattoir detected pathologies are of crucial importance to both pig production and food safety. Usually, more than one pathology coexist in a pig herd although it often remains unknown how these different pathologies interrelate to each other. Identification of the associations between different pathologies may facilitate an improved understanding of their underlying biological linkage, and support the veterinarians in encouraging control strategies aimed at reducing the prevalence of not just one, but two or more conditions simultaneously. RESULTS: Multi-dimensional machine learning methodology was used to identify associations between ten typical pathologies in 6485 batches of slaughtered finishing pigs, assisting the comprehension of their biological association. Pathologies potentially associated with septicaemia (e.g. pericarditis, peritonitis) appear interrelated, suggesting on-going bacterial challenges by pathogens such as Haemophilus parasuis and Streptococcus suis. Furthermore, hepatic scarring appears interrelated with both milk spot livers (Ascaris suum) and bacteria-related pathologies, suggesting a potential multi-pathogen nature for this pathology. CONCLUSIONS: The application of novel multi-dimensional machine learning methodology provided new insights into how typical pig pathologies are potentially interrelated at batch level. The methodology presented is a powerful exploratory tool to generate hypotheses, applicable to a wide range of studies in veterinary research.
TI  - Fifteen Streptococcus suis serotypes identified by multiplex PCR.
AB  - A multiplex PCR was developed to detect 15 serotypes of Streptococcus suis. This  multiplex PCR was separated into two reaction sets. The first set identified nine serotypes (serotypes 1/2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 14 and 16) and the second set identified six serotypes (serotypes 5, 8, 10, 19, 23 and 25). This assay correctly detected serotypes 2, 5 and 14 in human isolates, and serotypes 1, 2, 1/2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 14, 16 and 19 in pig isolates from Thailand. No cross-reaction was observed with other streptococcal species. This assay may be useful for the serotype surveillance of human and pig isolates of S. suis.
TI  - Construction and characterization of a Streptococcus suis serotype 2 recombinant  expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S. suis 2) is an important pathogen, responsible for diverse diseases in swine and humans. To obtain a S. suis 2 strain that can be tracked in vitro and in vivo, we constructed the Egfp-HA9801 recombinant S. suis 2 strain with egfp and spc(r) genes inserted via homologous recombination. To assess the effects of the egfp and spc(r) genes in HA9801, the biochemical characteristics, growth features and virulence in Balb/C mice were compared between the recombinant and the parent HA9801 strain. We detected the EGFP expression from Egfp-HA9801 by epifluorescence microscopy. The results showed that the biochemical characterization and growth features of the Egfp-HA9801 recombinant were highly similar to that of the parent HA9801. We did not find significant differences in lethality (50% lethal dose), morbidity and mortality between the two strains. Furthermore, the bacterial counts in each various tissues of Egfp-HA9801-infected mice displayed similar dynamic compared with the HA9801-infected mice. Our results also showed that the Egfp-HA9801 cells grown at 37 degrees C for 36 h displayed greater green fluorescence signals than the cells grown at 28 degrees C for 36 h and 37 degrees C for 24 h. The fluorescence in the tissue cryosections of Egfp-HA9801-injected mice was also stronger than that of the HA9801 group. Together, these results indicate that the egfp and spc(r) insertions into the Egfp-HA9801 recombinant did not significantly change the virulence when compared with HA980, and this EGFP labeled strain can be used for future S. suis 2 pathogenesis research.
TI  - A newly anti-Streptococcus suis bacteriocin producing strain from unweaned piglets fecal matter: isolation, preliminary identification, and optimization of medium composition for enhanced bacteriocin production.
AB  - A newly isolated anti-Streptococcus suis bacteriocin-producing strain LPL1-5 was  obtained from healthy unweaned piglets' fecal matter, and was designated as Lactobacillus pentosus LPL1-5 based on morphology, biochemical properties, and 16S rDNA sequencing analysis. The medium composition for enhanced bacteriocin production by L. pentosus LPL1-5 was optimized by statistical methodology. Yeast extract, K(2)HPO(4).3H(2)O, and MnSO(4).H(2)O were identified as significant components influencing pentocin LPL1-5 production using the Plackett-Burman method. Response surface methodology was applied for further optimization. The concentrations of medium components for enhanced pentocin LPL1-5 production were as follows (g/L): lactose 20.00, tryptone 10.00, beef extract 10.00, yeast extract 14.00, MnSO(4).H(2)O 0.84, K(2)HPO(4).3H(2)O 4.92, triammonium citrate 2.00, Na-acetate 5.00, MgSO(4).7H(2)O 0.58, Tween 80 1.00. Under the optimized condition, a value of 3154.65 +/- 27.93 IU/mL bacteriocin activity was achieved, which was 4.2-fold that of the original medium.
TI  - Prevalence of Streptococcus suis genotypes in isolates from porcine endocarditis  in East Japan.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important pathogen for both swine and humans. In this study, we genotyped 105 S. suis isolates from porcine endocarditis in East Japan on the basis of profiles of capsular serotype-specific, virulence-associated and pilus-associated genes. The most common genotype was cps2J/mrp+/epf-/sly-/sbp2-/sep1-/sgp1+ (76.19%), followed by nt(non-typeable)/mrp+/epf-/sly-/sbp2-/sep1-/sgp1+ (7.62%) and cps2J/mrp+/epf+/sly+/sbp2+/sep1-/sgp1- (7.62%). The representative isolates of mrp+/epf-/sly-/sbp2-/sep1-/sgp1+ were classified into ST28 complex, a clonal complex previously referred to as ST27 complex, whereas those of mrp+/epf+/sly+/sbp2+/sep1-/sgp1- were classified into ST1 complex by multilocus sequence typing. Because the majority of human clinical isolates were assigned to ST1 and ST28 complexes, most isolates from porcine endocarditis investigated in this study may have the potential to cause S. suis infection in humans.
TI  - Development of rapid serotype-specific PCR assays for eight serotypes of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an emerging zoonotic pathogen causing severe infections in  pigs and humans. Thirty-three serotypes of S. suis have been identified using serum agglutination. The capsular polysaccharides synthesis (cps) locus is usually conserved among different strains of the same serotype. The cps loci of 15 serotypes have been sequenced, while the loci of the other serotypes remain unknown. In the present study, two to six serotype-specific genes of each of eight serotypes, i.e., serotypes 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 19, 23, and 25, were identified using cross-hybridization with 93 nucleic acid probes specific to genes in the cps locus, and serotype-specific PCR assays for rapid and sensitive detection of the eight serotypes were then developed. The PCR typing results of the 148 serologically typeable isolates were completely consistent with agglutination results. Furthermore, some autoagglutinating, acapsular, and multiagglutinating strains which could not be differentiated by traditional serum agglutination assays were positive in the PCR assays. Use of the PCR assays with clinical tonsillar specimens showed that the assays are sensitive and able to identify samples with autoagglutinating isolates. To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify the serotype-specific genes of the eight Streptococcus suis serotypes and develop rapid and sensitive PCR assays for the eight serotypes which can be identified only by serum agglutination.
TI  - Human Streptococcus suis Endocarditis: Echocardiographic Features and Clinical Outcome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human Streptococcus suis endocarditis occurs infrequently and continues to be a serious illness with high mortality. However, knowledge of the echocardiographic features and clinical outcome of this disease remains unclear. METHODS: One hundred and fourteen patients were identified in a prospective study, and hospitalized at Queen Sirikit Heart Center and Srinagarind Hospital, Khon Kaen University. Echocardiography was routinely performed in all patients. RESULTS: Between January 2010 and December 2011, three cases of S. suis endocarditis were diagnosed. All cases were male and aged 27-53 years. The most common risk factor for contracting S. suis infection was eating undercooked pork. Three patients presented with congestive heart failure. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated large, highly mobile vegetations and severe valvular damage. Aortic valve involvement was documented in two patients, and mitral valve involvement in one. One patient presented with embolic stroke and one with arterial occlusion. All patients underwent urgent valve replacement with a good clinical outcome. CONCLUSION: The echocardiographic features of S. suis endocarditis show destructive, extensive valvular damage and early embolization with a fulminant course, needing early surgical intervention with a good clinical outcome.
TI  - Descriptive clinical and epidemiological characteristics of influenza A H1N1 2009 virus infections in pigs in England.
AB  - Infection of pigs with influenza A H1N1 2009 virus (A(H1N1)pdm09) was first detected in England in November 2009 following global spread of the virus in the human population. This paper describes clinical and epidemiological findings in the first English pig farms in which A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus was detected. These farms showed differences in disease presentation, spread and duration of infection. The factors likely to influence these features are described and relate to whether pigs were housed or outdoors, the age of the pigs, inter-current disease and the management system of the unit. Infection could be mild or clinically inapparent in breeding pigs with more typical respiratory disease being identified later in their progeny. Mortality was low where disease was uncomplicated by environmental stresses or concurrent infections. Where deaths occurred in pigs infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza, they were mainly due to other infections, including streptococcal disease due to Streptococcus suis infection. This paper demonstrates the ease with which A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was transmitted horizontally and maintained in a pig population.
TI  - Exploring the pan-surfome of Streptococcus suis: looking for common protein antigens.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is a swine and human pathogen for which no commercial vaccine  is still available. Conserved and broadly distributed surface proteins have become the chosen targets for the development of efficacious vaccines that could overcome the problems of non-heterologous protection of bacterins or capsule polysaccharide-based vaccines. In this work, we have analyzed by proteomics a collection of 39 strains obtained from infected pigs. The isolates belonged to 19 of the most prevalent serotypes during the last years. We have applied the "shaving" approach to define the "pan-surfome" or the set of both common and unique surface proteins identified in such strains. This set was constituted by 113 proteins. We have categorized them for their potential for further vaccination studies, based on their distribution among strains and their a priori accessibility to antibodies. According to these criteria, the cell-wall protein SsnA appears to be the best candidate from this list, as it was that with the widest distribution among the analyzed pathogen types, it showed to be highly immunogenic and highly accessible to antibodies, as demonstrated by flow cytometry.
TI  - [Cloning and analysis of the conserved regions in the capsular polysaccharides synthesis locus of Streptococcus suis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To learn about the function and gene phylogenetic relationship of the  conserved regions in capsular polysaccharides synthesis (CPS) locus, METHODS: based on the CPS locus sequence of Streptococcus suis serotype 1, 2, 7 and 9 and the results to the cross-hybridization experiments, the CPS locus of Streptococcus suis was hypothesized as cassette-like structure which is similar to Streptococcus pneumoniae. PCR, sequencing and southern blotting was used to certify the hypothesis. RESULTS: The CPS locus of Streptococcus suis was cassette-like structure. The 5'-end of the CPS locus contained 4 regulatory genes which are highly similar in all the serotypes. The flanking genes of the CPS locus are conservative. The flanking gene aroA, which is at the downstream to the CPS locus, was selected as the objective gene to develop the PCR to amplify the serotype-specific regions. The orfY, orfX, cpsA, cpsB, cpsC, cpsD and aroA are conserved with high sequence identity in different serotypes.
TI  - [Capsular saliva acid of Streptococcus suis 2 influences virulence and host inflammatory responses].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We clarified the pathogenic influence of the absence of Streptococcus  suis type 2 capsular saliva acid on BLAB/c mice. METHODS: The virulence of the experimental strains were compared; the distribution of strains in vivo was determined by quantitative plating. Histopathological analysis was used to qualitatively compare the different pathogenicity of wild strain and knockout strains. ELISA was used to test the levels of cytokine in whole blood cells for the stimulation of strains. RESULTS: The virulence of mutant strains was significantly reduced, and when the genes were restored, toxicity levels were recovered to that of the wild type strain. The distribution in blood and in the brain between wild strain and knock out strains has significant difference, and Streptococcus suis type 2 strains can cause different degrees of brain damage. During the in vitro test, the mutant strains can stimulate the whole blood cells to secrete higher levels of MCP-1 and IL-6. CONCLUSION: Capsular saliva acid affects bacterial virulence and host cell inflammation response. As an important virulence factor of Streptococcus suis type 2, it can damage the blood brain barrier and cause meningitis.
TI  - Inactivation of the gene encoding zinc-binding lipoprotein 103 impairs the infectivity of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - The Streptococcus suis 103 gene product is an immunogenic and protective lipoprotein that is a component of an ATP-binding cassette transporter implicated in zinc uptake. Belonging to the same transcriptional unit and downstream of the 103 gene is a gene that encodes a homologue of the pneumococcal histidine triad (Pht) protein Pht309. In an intraperitoneal mouse model the virulence of a mutant lacking the 103 gene was more than 50 times lower than that of the wild-type (WT) parent strain, S. suis serotype 2 strain P1/7. In addition, the immunogenicity of this mutant was dramatically decreased. In striking contrast, the virulence and immunogenicity of a P1/7 mutant lacking the Pht309 gene were similar to those of the parent strain. These results demonstrate that the 103 lipoprotein is strongly involved in S. suis virulence and support the hypothesis that this lipoprotein might be an excellent candidate for vaccines aiming to achieve broad protection against streptococci.
TI  - In vitro biofilm forming potential of Streptococcus suis isolated from human and  swine in China.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is a swine pathogen and also a zoonotic agent. The formation of biofilms allows S. suis to become persistent colonizers and resist clearance by the host immune system and antibiotics. In this study, biofilm forming potentials of various S. suis strains were characterized by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and tissue culture plates stained with crystal violet. In addition, the effects of five antimicrobial agents on biofilm formation were assayed in this study. S. suis produced biofilms on smooth and rough surface. The nutritional contents including glucose and NaCl in the growth medium modulated biofilm formation. There was a significant difference in their biofilm-forming ability among all 46 S. suis strains. The biofilm-forming potential of S. suis serotype 9 was stronger than type 2 and all other types. However, biofilm formation was inhibited by five commonly used antimicrobial agents, penicillin, erythromycin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin at subinhibitory concentrations, among which inhibition of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin was stronger than that of other three antimicrobial agents.Our study provides a detailed analysis of biofilm formation potential in S. suis, which is a step towards understanding its role in pathogenesis, and eventually lead to a better understanding of how to eradicate S. suis growing as biofilms with antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance, serotypes, and virulence factors of Streptococcus suis  isolates from diseased pigs.
AB  - Streptococcus suis isolates from diseased pigs were examined for susceptibility to nine antimicrobials, possession of virulence-associated factors (VFs), and distribution of serotypes. The association between antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and serotypes as well as VFs was subsequently assessed. Among the isolates investigated, serotype 2 (66.04%) was mostly prevalent, followed by serotypes 1 (23.27%), 9 (1.26%), and 7 (0.63%), whereas 14 isolates were untypable by the polymerase chain reaction typing method used. Analysis with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed the isolates had diverse DNA macrorestriction patterns. The frequency of antimicrobial resistance among the S. suis isolates was higher than that reported from other countries. It is notable that multiple antimicrobial resistance (three or more antimicrobials) was observed with 98.73% of the S. suis isolates, and the dominant resistance phenotype was erythromycin-tilmicosin-clindamycin-chloramphenicol-levofloxacin-ceftiofur-kanamy cin-tetracycline-penicillin (35.85%). The most prevalent VFs were those encoded by muramidase-released protein (61.64%), followed by suilysin (56.60%) and extracellular factor (46.54%). Presence of VFs and the possession of certain AMR phenotypes were significantly associated as determined by statistical analysis. Together, these findings indicate that the clinical S. suis isolates obtained from diseased pigs in China are genetically diverse, are resistant to multiple antibiotics of clinical importance, and carry known virulence factors.
TI  - Characterization of a Streptococcus suis tet(O/W/32/O)-carrying element transferable to major streptococcal pathogens.
AB  - Mosaic tetracycline resistance determinants are a recently discovered class of hybrids of ribosomal protection tet genes. They may show different patterns of mosaicism, but their final size has remained unaltered. Initially thought to be confined to a small group of anaerobic bacteria, mosaic tet genes were then found to be widespread. In the genus Streptococcus, a mosaic tet gene [tet(O/W/32/O)] was first discovered in Streptococcus suis, an emerging drug-resistant pig and human pathogen. In this study, we report the molecular characterization of a tet(O/W/32/O) gene-carrying mobile element from an S. suis isolate. tet(O/W/32/O) was detected, in tandem with tet(40), in a circular 14,741-bp genetic element (39.1% G+C; 17 open reading frames [ORFs] identified). The novel element, which we designated 15K, also carried the macrolide resistance determinant erm(B) and an aminoglycoside resistance four-gene cluster including aadE (streptomycin) and aphA (kanamycin). 15K appeared to be an unstable genetic element that, in the absence of recombinases, is capable of undergoing spontaneous excision under standard growth conditions. In the integrated form, 15K was found inside a 54,879-bp integrative and conjugative element (ICE) (50.5% G+C; 55 ORFs), which we designated ICESsu32457. An approximately 1.3-kb segment that apparently served as the att site for excision of the unstable 15K element was identified. The novel ICE was transferable at high frequency to recipients from pathogenic Streptococcus species (S. suis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus agalactiae), suggesting that the multiresistance 15K element can successfully spread within streptococcal populations.
TI  - Streptococcus suis infection in Taiwan, 2000-2011.
AB  - From 2000 to 2011, 8 patients with Streptococcus suis infections were identified  in Taiwan. Six isolates were initially misidentified as Streptococcus acidominimus using commercial identification systems and later confirmed to be S. suis using 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis. Among the 7 isolates available for further analysis, all belonged to biotype II. Three serotype I isolates possessed the same genotypes, indicating the possible clonal spread of S. suis. All of these patients survived. S. suis infection is underestimated in Taiwan.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of 89K pathogenicity island-positive ST-7 strains  of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 from healthy pigs, Northeast China.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is a swine pathogen which can also cause severe infection, such as meningitis, and streptococcal-like toxic shock syndrome (STSS), in humans. In China, most of the S. suis infections in humans were reported in the southern areas with warm and humid climates, but little attention had been paid to the northern areas. Data presented here showed that the virulent serotypes 1, 2, 7, and 9 of S. suis could be steadily isolated from the healthy pigs in the pig farms in all the three provinces of Northeast China. Notably, a majority of the serotype 2 isolates belonged to the 89K pathogenicity island-positive ST-7 clone that had historically caused the human STSS outbreaks in the Sichuan and Jiangsu provinces of China, although the human STSS case caused by S. suis had never been reported in northern areas of China. Data presented here indicated that the survey of S. suis should be expanded to or reinforced in the northern areas of China.
TI  - [Construction and activities of suilysin mutants].
AB  - AIM: To construct the suilysin mutant without hemolytic activity and evaluate its functions. METHODS: The proline in 353 site of suilysin was site-directed mutated to alanine, leucine and valine, respectively. The recombinant mutants were renaturated and purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography, and the purified proteins were evaluated in the hemolytic activity and immunogenicity. RESULTS: We obtained three mutants, SLY(P353A), SLY(P353L) and SLY(P353V). The SLY(P353V) mutant had non-hemolytic activity. Western blotting and animal experiments showed that SLY(P353V) mutant still had immunogenicity. CONCLUSION: Suilysin mutant SLY(P353V) has no hemolytic activity but remains immunogenicity.
TI  - Identification and proteome analysis of the two-component VirR/VirS system in epidemic Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is an important zoonotic pathogen that infects pigs and sporadically causes serious infections in humans. Two recent large-scale outbreaks of human streptococcal toxic-shock-like syndrome with high mortality occurred in China, posing new challenges for global public health. However, the global regulation of the virulence of epidemic SS2 isolates lacks a systematic understanding. In this study, we performed a mutational and functional analysis of an SS2 two-component system that is orthologous to the VirR/VirS regulatory system of Clostridium perfringens. An isogenic knockout mutant of VirR/VirS (DeltavirRS) was found to exhibit marked phenotypic changes, including the formation of shorter chains and thinner capsular walls, more easily cleared in whole blood, and decreased oxidative stress tolerance. Furthermore, the DeltavirRS mutant was greatly attenuated in a mouse model. Comparative proteome analysis of the expression profiles of the wild-type strain with the DeltavirRS mutant allowed us to identify 72 proteins that are differentially expressed in the absence of the VirR/VirS system and that are directly responsible for the pleiotropic phenotype of the DeltavirRS mutant.

TI  - Aetiologies of central nervous system infection in Viet Nam: a prospective provincial hospital-based descriptive surveillance study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infectious diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) remain common and life-threatening, especially in developing countries. Knowledge of the aetiological agents responsible for these infections is essential to guide empiric therapy and develop a rational public health policy. To date most data has come from patients admitted to tertiary referral hospitals in Asia and there is limited aetiological data at the provincial hospital level where most patients are seen. METHODS: We conducted a prospective Provincial Hospital-based descriptive surveillance study in adults and children at thirteen hospitals in central and southern Viet Nam between August 2007-April 2010. The pathogens of CNS infection were confirmed in CSF and blood samples by using classical microbiology, molecular diagnostics and serology. RESULTS: We recruited 1241 patients with clinically suspected infection of the CNS. An aetiological agent was identified in 640/1241 (52%) of the patients. The most common pathogens were Streptococcus suis serotype 2 in patients older than 14 years of age (147/617, 24%) and Japanese encephalitis virus in patients less than 14 years old (142/624, 23%). Mycobacterium tuberculosis was confirmed in 34/617 (6%) adult patients and 11/624 (2%) paediatric patients. The acute case fatality rate (CFR) during hospital admission was 73/617 (12%) in adults and to 42/624 (7%) in children. CONCLUSIONS: Zoonotic bacterial and viral pathogens are the most common causes of CNS infection in adults and children in Viet Nam.
TI  - A Fur-like protein PerR regulates two oxidative stress response related operons dpr and metQIN in Streptococcus suis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Metal ions are important micronutrients in cellular metabolism, but excess ions that cause toxic reactive oxygen species are harmful to cells. In bacteria, Fur family proteins such as Fur, Zur and PerR manage the iron and zinc uptake and oxidative stress responses, respectively. The single Fur-like protein (annotated as PerR) in Streptococcus suis has been demonstrated to be involved in zinc and iron uptake in previous studies, but the reports on oxidative stress response and gene regulation are limited. RESULTS: In the present study, the perR gene deletion mutant DeltaperR was constructed in Streptococcus suis serotype 2 strain SC-19, and the mutant strain DeltaperR exhibited less sensitivity to H2O2 stress compared to the wild-type. The dpr and metQIN were found to be upregulated in the DeltaperR strain compared with SC-19. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the promoters of dpr and metQIN could be bound by the PerR protein. These results suggest that dpr and metQIN are members of the PerR regulon of S. suis. dpr encodes a Dps-like peroxide resistance protein, and the dpr knockout strains (Deltadpr and DeltadprDeltaperR) were highly sensitive to H2O2. MetQIN is a methionine transporter, and the increased utilization of methionine in the DeltaperR strain indirectly affected the peroxide resistance. Using a promoter-EGFP gene fusion reporting system, we found that the PerR regulon was induced by H2O2, and the induction was modulated by metal ions. Finally, we found that the pathogenicity of the perR mutant was attenuated and easily cleared by mice. CONCLUSIONS: These data strongly suggest that the Fur-like protein PerR directly regulates dpr and metQIN and plays a crucial role in oxidative stress response in S. suis.
TI  - Future challenges in the elimination of bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Despite the widespread implementation of several effective vaccines over the past few decades, bacterial meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and Group B Streptococcus (GBS) still results in unacceptably high levels of human mortality and morbidity. A residual disease burden due to bacterial meningitis is also apparent due to a number of persistent or emerging pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp. and Streptococcus suis. Here, we review the current status of bacterial meningitis caused by these pathogens, highlighting how past and present vaccination programs have attempted to counter these pathogens. We discuss how improved pathogen surveillance, implementation of current vaccines, and development of novel vaccines may be expected to further reduce bacterial meningitis and related diseases in the future.
TI  - Differences in the population structure of invasive Streptococcus suis strains isolated from pigs and from humans in The Netherlands.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is the main cause of zoonotic S. suis infection despite the fact that other serotypes are frequently isolated from diseased pigs. Studies comparing concurrent invasive human and pig isolates from a single geographical location are lacking. We compared the population structures of invasive S. suis strains isolated between 1986 and 2008 from human patients (N = 24) and from pigs with invasive disease (N = 124) in The Netherlands by serotyping and multi locus sequence typing (MLST). Fifty-six percent of pig isolates were of serotype 9 belonging to 15 clonal complexes (CCs) or singleton sequence types (ST). In contrast, all human isolates were of serotype 2 and belonged to two non-overlapping clonal complexes CC1 (58%) and CC20 (42%). The proportion of serotype 2 isolates among S. suis strains isolated from humans was significantly higher than among strains isolated from pigs (24/24 vs. 29/124; P<0.0001). This difference remained significant when only strains within CC1 and CC20 were considered (24/24 vs. 27/37,P = 0.004). The Simpson diversity index of the S. suis population isolated from humans (0.598) was smaller than of the population isolated from pigs (0.765, P = 0.05) indicating that the S. suis population isolated from infected pigs was more diverse than the S. suis population isolated from human patients. S. suis serotype 2 strains of CC20 were all negative in a PCR for detection of genes encoding extracellular protein factor (EF) variants. These data indicate that the polysaccharide capsule is an important correlate of human S. suis infection, irrespective of the ST and EF encoding gene type of S. suis strains.
TI  - Molecular dynamics simulation of the complex PBP-2x with drug cefuroxime to explore the drug resistance mechanism of Streptococcus suis R61.
AB  - Drug resistance of Streptococcus suis strains is a worldwide problem for both humans and pigs. Previous studies have noted that penicillin-binding protein (PBPs) mutation is one important cause of beta-lactam antibiotic resistance. In this study, we used the molecular dynamics (MD) method to study the interaction differences between cefuroxime (CES) and PBP2x within two newly sequenced Streptococcus suis: drug-sensitive strain A7, and drug-resistant strain R61. The MM-PBSA results proved that the drug bound much more tightly to PBP2x in A7 (PBP2x-A7) than to PBP2x in R61 (PBP2x-R61). This is consistent with the evidently different resistances of the two strains to cefuroxime. Hydrogen bond analysis indicated that PBP2x-A7 preferred to bind to cefuroxime rather than to PBP2x-R61. Three stable hydrogen bonds were formed by the drug and PBP2x-A7, while only one unstable bond existed between the drug and PBP2x-R61. Further, we found that the Gln569, Tyr594, and Gly596 residues were the key mutant residues contributing directly to the different binding by pair wise energy decomposition comparison. By investigating the binding mode of the drug, we found that mutant residues Ala320, Gln553, and Thr595 indirectly affected the final phenomenon by topological conformation alteration. Above all, our results revealed some details about the specific interaction between the two PBP2x proteins and the drug cefuroxime. To some degree, this explained the drug resistance mechanism of Streptococcus suis and as a result could be helpful for further drug design or improvement.
TI  - Lysozyme resistance in Streptococcus suis is highly variable and multifactorial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus suis is an important infectious agent for pigs and occasionally for humans. The host innate immune system plays a key role in preventing and eliminating S. suis infections. One important constituent of the innate immune system is the protein lysozyme, which is present in a variety of body fluids and immune cells. Lysozyme acts as a peptidoglycan degrading enzyme causing bacterial lysis. Several pathogens have developed mechanisms to evade lysozyme-mediated killing. In the present study we compared the lysozyme sensitivity of various S. suis isolates and investigated the molecular basis of lysozyme resistance for this pathogen. RESULTS: The lysozyme minimal inhibitory concentrations of a wide panel of S. suis isolates varied between 0.3 to 10 mg/ml. By inactivating the oatA gene in a serotype 2 and a serotype 9 strain, we showed that OatA-mediated peptidoglycan modification partly contributes to lysozyme resistance. Furthermore, inactivation of the murMN operon provided evidence that additional peptidoglycan crosslinking is not involved in lysozyme resistance in S. suis. Besides a targeted approach, we also used an unbiased approach for identifying factors involved in lysozyme resistance. Based on whole genome comparisons of a lysozyme sensitive strain and selected lysozyme resistant derivatives, we detected several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were correlated with the lysozyme resistance trait. Two SNPs caused defects in protein expression of an autolysin and a capsule sugar transferase. Analysis of specific isogenic mutants, confirmed the involvement of autolysin activity and capsule structures in lysozyme resistance of S. suis. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that lysozyme resistance levels are highly variable among S. suis isolates and serotypes. Furthermore, the results show that lysozyme resistance in S. suis can involve different mechanisms including OatA-mediated peptidolycan modification, autolysin activity and capsule production.
TI  - Immunomodulatory effects of Streptococcus suis capsule type on human dendritic cell responses, phagocytosis and intracellular survival.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is a major porcine pathogen of significant commercial importance worldwide and an emerging zoonotic pathogen of humans. Given the important sentinel role of mucosal dendritic cells and their importance in induction of T cell responses we investigated the effect of different S. suis serotype strains and an isogenic capsule mutant of serotype 2 on the maturation, activation and expression of IL-10, IL-12p70 and TNF-alpha in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Additionally, we compared phagocytosis levels and bacterial survival after internalization. The capsule of serotype 2, the most common serotype associated with infection in humans and pigs, was highly anti-phagocytic and modulated the IL-10/IL-12 and IL-10/TNF-alpha cytokine production in favor of a more anti-inflammatory profile compared to other serotypes. This may have consequences for the induction of effective immunity to S. suis serotype 2 in humans. A shielding effect of the capsule on innate Toll-like receptor signaling was also demonstrated. Furthermore, we showed that 24 h after phagocytosis, significant numbers of viable intracellular S. suis were still present intracellularly. This may contribute to the dissemination of S. suis in the body.
TI  - A novel intranasal mouse model for mucosal colonization by Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis causes meningitis and various other diseases in pigs and humans. Healthy piglets carrying virulent Streptococcus suis strains on their mucosal surfaces are epidemiologically very important. The objective of this study was to establish an intranasal Streptococcus suis mouse model for invasion and colonization of the respiratory tract. CD1 mice were infected intranasally with a highly virulent Streptococcus suis serotype 2 strain under different conditions. Clinical, histological and bacteriological screenings revealed that invasion of host tissue occurred in the majority of mice only after predisposition with 12.5 microl 1 % acetic acid per nostril. Severe fibrinosuppurative or purulent necrotizing pneumonia associated with Streptococcus suis was a common manifestation. Furthermore, a novel model to study nasopharyngeal colonization was established by reducing the volume of 1 % acetic acid per nostril to 5 microl prior to Streptococcus suis application. This model mimics asymptomatic carriage in swine, as all mice carried Streptococcus suis on their respiratory mucosa at 7 days post-infection (p.i.) in moderate to high numbers without the development of pneumonia or any other invasive Streptococcus suis disease. This intranasal Streptococcus suis model was applied to investigate the function of suilysin (SLY) in colonization. Although an isogenic SLY mutant was isolated from the upper respiratory tract at a lower recovery rate than its wild-type parental strain at 14 days p.i., the differences were not significant and did not indicate severe attenuation in colonization. In conclusion, this work describes to the best of our knowledge the first intranasal mouse model to study colonization of the respiratory tract by a highly virulent Streptococcus suis pathotype.
TI  - Fhb, a novel factor H-binding surface protein, contributes to the antiphagocytic  ability and virulence of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is a Gram-positive bacterium that causes sepsis and meningitis in piglets and humans. The mechanisms of S. suis serotype 2 invasive disease are not well understood. The surface proteins of pathogens usually play important roles in infection and bacterium-host interactions. Here, we identified a novel surface protein that contributed significantly to the virulence of S. suis serotype 2 in a piglet infection model. This protein showed little similarity to other reported proteins and exhibited strong binding activity to human factor H (hFH). It was designated Fhb (factor H-binding protein). The fhb genes found in S. suis serotypes 1, 2, 4, 7, and 9 exhibited molecular polymorphism. Fhb possessed two proline-rich repeat sequences and XPZ domains, and one repeat sequence exhibited a high homology to Bac, an IgA-binding protein of Streptococcus agalactiae. Evidence strongly indicated that fhb-deficient mutants had diminished phagocytosis resistance in bactericidal assays. In addition, Fhb plays important roles in complement-mediated immunity by interacting with hFH. These findings indicated that Fhb is a crucial surface protein contributing to the virulence of S. suis, with important functions in evading innate immune defenses by interaction with host complement regulatory factor hFH.
TI  - Combined antibacterial activity of phage lytic proteins holin and lysin from Streptococcus suis bacteriophage SMP.
AB  - Development of novel antibacterial agents is required to control infection with multidrug-resistant Streptococcus suis. HolSMP and LySMP, the holin and lysin of S. suis serotype 2 bacteriophage, named SMP, are responsible for lysis of host cells and release of progeny phage. HolSMP and LySMP expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) exerted efficient activity at 37 degrees C, pH 5.2, with addition of 0.8 % beta-mercaptoethanol. Lytic spectra of purified HolSMP, LySMP or HolSMP + LySMP mixture were investigated. HolSMP, exhibiting a narrow lytic spectrum, was effective against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis, which were insensitive to LySMP. Moreover, HolSMP was identified as a promising antibacterial agent which was able to extend the spectrum of LySMP. The data suggest that combined use of holin and lysin could be a candidate strategy for resolution of drug resistance.
TI  - Complete genome sequence, lifestyle, and multi-drug resistance of the human pathogen Corynebacterium resistens DSM 45100 isolated from blood samples of a leukemia patient.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Corynebacterium resistens was initially recovered from human infections and recognized as a new coryneform species that is highly resistant to antimicrobial agents. Bacteremia associated with this organism in immunocompromised patients was rapidly fatal as standard minocycline therapies failed. C. resistens DSM 45100 was isolated from a blood culture of samples taken from a patient with acute myelocytic leukemia. The complete genome sequence of C. resistens DSM 45100 was determined by pyrosequencing to identify genes contributing to multi-drug resistance, virulence, and the lipophilic lifestyle of this newly described human pathogen. RESULTS: The genome of C. resistens DSM 45100 consists of a circular chromosome of 2,601,311 bp in size and the 28,312-bp plasmid pJA144188. Metabolic analysis showed that the genome of C. resistens DSM 45100 lacks genes for typical sugar uptake systems, anaplerotic functions, and a fatty acid synthase, explaining the strict lipophilic lifestyle of this species. The genome encodes a broad spectrum of enzymes ensuring the availability of exogenous fatty acids for growth, including predicted virulence factors that probably contribute to fatty acid metabolism by damaging host tissue. C. resistens DSM 45100 is able to use external L-histidine as a combined carbon and nitrogen source, presumably as a result of adaptation to the hitherto unknown habitat on the human skin. Plasmid pJA144188 harbors several genes contributing to antibiotic resistance of C. resistens DSM 45100, including a tetracycline resistance region of the Tet W type known from Lactobacillus reuteri and Streptococcus suis. The tet(W) gene of pJA144188 was cloned in Corynebacterium glutamicum and was shown to confer high levels of resistance to tetracycline, doxycycline, and minocycline in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: The detected gene repertoire of C. resistens DSM 45100 provides insights into the lipophilic lifestyle and virulence functions of this newly recognized pathogen. Plasmid pJA144188 revealed a modular architecture of gene regions that contribute to the multi-drug resistance of C. resistens DSM 45100. The tet(W) gene encoding a ribosomal protection protein is reported here for the first time in corynebacteria. Cloning of the tet(W) gene mediated resistance to second generation tetracyclines in C. glutamicum, indicating that it might be responsible for the failure of minocycline therapies in patients with C. resistens bacteremia.
TI  - Meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis: case report and review of the literature.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human infection with Streptococcus suis (S. suis), a zoonotic pathogen, has been reported mainly in pig-rearing and pork-consuming countries. Meningitis is the most-common clinical manifestation and is often associated with deafness and vestibular dysfunction. CASE REPORT: A 57-year-old man was referred to the hospital with headaches, fevers, chills, and hearing impairment. Meningitis was confirmed and S. suis was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid. Spondylodiscitis occurred after 2 weeks of antibiotic treatment, and was successfully treated with a prolonged course of antibiotics for another 4 weeks. His hearing loss was irreversible despite the improvement of other symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: We report the first human case of S. suis infection in Korea. In patients presenting with meningitis, S. suis should be considered if the characteristic features of prominent and early hearing loss are present.
TI  - Sialylation of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is essential for capsule expression  but is not responsible for the main capsular epitope.
AB  - The capsular polysaccharide is a critical virulence factor of the swine and zoonotic pathogen Streptococcus suis serotype 2. The capsule of this bacterium is composed of five different sugars, including terminal sialic acid. To evaluate the role of sialic acid in the pathogenesis of the infection, the neuC gene, encoding for an enzyme essential for sialic acid biosynthesis, was inactivated in a highly virulent S. suis serotype 2 strain. Using transmission electron microscopy, it was shown that inactivation of neuC resulted in loss of expression of the whole capsule. Compared to the parent strain, the DeltaneuC mutant strain was more phagocytosed by macrophages and was also severely impaired in virulence in a mouse infection model. Both native and desialylated S. suis serotype 2 purified capsular polysaccharides were recognized by a polyclonal anti-whole cell S. suis serotype 2 serum and a monospecific polyclonal anti-capsule serotype 2 serum. In contrast, only the native capsular polysaccharide was recognized by a monoclonal antibody specific for the sialic acid moiety of the serotype 2 capsule. Together, our results infer that sialylation of S. suis serotype 2 may be essential for capsule expression, but that this sugar is not the main epitope of this serotype.
TI  - Streptococcus suis serotype 9 bacterin immunogenicity and protective efficacy.
AB  - Streptococcus suis diseases in pigs, most importantly meningitis, are worldwide responsible for major economic losses in the pig industry. About one fourth of invasive S. suis diseases are caused by S. suis serotype 9 strains in Europe. However, little is known about serotype 9 since most studies were performed with serotype 2. The objective of this study was to determine the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a serotype 9 bacterin in piglets. Challenge was conducted with a reference serotype 9 strain, belonging to the same clonal complex but to a different sequence type as the bacterin strain. The bacterin induced protection against mortality but not morbidity. Eleven days post infection, 3 of 7 vaccinated survivors were not fully convalescent and had not eliminated the challenge strain from inner organs completely. In accordance with the clinical findings, the majority of piglets showed fibrinous-suppurative lesions in at least one inner organ or tissue. In contrast to the placebo group such lesions were not detected in one third of bacterin-vaccinated piglets. Determination of specific serum IgG titers revealed that the bacterin elicited seroconversion against muramidase-released protein and basic membrane lipoprotein. Furthermore, vaccination was associated with induction of opsonizing antibodies against the serotype 9 challenge strain. However, titers of opsonizing antibodies were rather low in comparison to those found in our previous serotype 2 vaccination trial. Piglets developed substantially higher titers of opsonizing antibodies after challenge. Opsonizing antibodies were absorbable with the serotype 9 challenge strain but not with an unencapsulated isogenic mutant of a serotype 2 strain indicating their specificity. The results indicate that a serotype 9 bacterin is less protective than a serotype 2 bacterin, most likely due to inducing only low titers of opsonizing antibodies. This might contribute to emergence of serotype 9 strains, in particular strains of this clonal complex, in Europe.
TI  - First insights into the protective effects of a recombinant swinepox virus expressing truncated MRP of Streptococcus suis type 2 in mice.
AB  - To explore the potential of the swinepox virus (SPV) as vector for Streptococcus  suis vaccines, a vector system was developed for the construction of a recombinant SPV carrying bacterial genes. Using this system, a recombinant virus expressing truncated muramidase-released protein (MRP) of S. suis type 2 (SS2), designated rSPV-MRP, was produced and identified by PCR, western blotting and immunofluorescence assays. The rSPV-MRP was found to be only slightly attenuated in PK-15 cells, when compared with the wild-type virus. After immunization intramuscularly with rSPV-MRP, SS2 inactive vaccine (positive control), wild-type SPV (negative control) and PBS (blank control) respectively, all CD1 mice were challenged with a lethal dose or a sublethal dose of SS2 highly virulent strain ZY05719. While SS2 inactive vaccine protected all mice, immunization with rSPV-MRP resulted in 60% survival and protected mice against a lethal dose of the highly virulent SS2 strain, compared with the negative control (P < 0.05). Our data indicate that animals immunized with rSPV-MRP had a significantly reduced bacterial burden in all organs examined, compared to negative controls and blank controls (P <0.05). Antibody titers of the rSPV-MRP-vaccinated group were significantly higher (P <0.001), when compared to negative controls and blank controls. Antibody titers were also significantly higher in the vaccinated group at all time points post-vaccination (P <0.001), compared with the positive controls. These initial results demonstrated that the rSPV-MRP provided mice with protection from systemic SS2 infection. If SPV recombinants have the potential as S. suis vaccines for the use in pigs has to be evaluated in further studies.
TI  - Comparative proteomic analysis of Streptococcus suis biofilms and planktonic cells that identified biofilm infection-related immunogenic proteins.
AB  - Streptococcus suis (SS) is a zoonotic pathogen that causes severe disease symptoms in pigs and humans. Biofilms of SS bind to extracellular matrix proteins in both endothelial and epithelial cells and cause persistent infections. In this study, the differences in the protein expression profiles of SS grown either as planktonic cells or biofilms were identified using comparative proteomic analysis. The results revealed the existence of 13 proteins of varying amounts, among which six were upregulated and seven were downregulated in the Streptococcus biofilm compared with the planktonic controls. The convalescent serum from mini-pig, challenged with SS, was applied in a Western blot assay to visualize all proteins from the biofilm that were grown in vitro and separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. A total of 10 immunoreactive protein spots corresponding to nine unique proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS. Of these nine proteins, five (Manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 1-carboxyvinyltransferase, ornithine carbamoyltransferase, phosphoglycerate kinase, Hypothetical protein SSU05_0403) had no previously reported immunogenic properties in SS to our knowledge. The remaining four immunogenic proteins (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, hemolysin, pyruvate dehydrogenase and DnaK) were identified under both planktonic and biofilm growth conditions. In conclusion, the protein expression pattern of SS, grown as biofilm, was different from the SS grown as planktonic cells. These five immunogenic proteins that were specific to SS biofilm cells may potentially be targeted as vaccine candidates to protect against SS biofilm infections. The four proteins common to both biofilm and planktonic cells can be targeted as vaccine candidates to protect against both biofilm and acute infections.
TI  - The two-component system Ihk/Irr contributes to the virulence of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 strain 05ZYH33 through alteration of the bacterial cell metabolism.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S. suis 2) is an important zoonotic pathogen. It causes heavy economic losses in the pig-farming industry and can be associated with severe infections in humans, e.g. streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Understanding its pathogenesis is critical for prevention and control of diseases caused by S. suis 2. In this study, we show that deletion of a two-component system (TCS), 05SSU1660/1661 (orthologues of the Ihk/Irr TCS of Streptococcus pyogenes), in S. suis 2 strain 05ZYH33 results in notable attenuation of virulence, as exemplified by reduced adherence to mucosal epithelium cells, increased elimination by macrophages, reduced ability to survive in an acidic or oxidative-stressed environment, and lowered pathogenicity in mice. Further analysis of differential proteomics profiles by two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed that while many previously well-known virulence factors, such as suilysin, autolysin and muraminidase-released protein, were not expressed differentially, cell metabolism was downregulated in the Ihk/Irr deletion mutant. In addition, the oxidative-stress response gene for manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) was also repressed significantly in the mutant. Collectively, our data suggest that the Ihk/Irr TCS contributes to the virulence of S. suis 2 strain 05ZYH33, mainly through alteration of the bacterial cell metabolism.
TI  - Haemophilus parasuis serovars isolated from pathological samples in Northern Italy.
AB  - From January 2007 to December 2011, a total of 106 Haemophilus parasuis strains isolated from pigs were serotyped by agar gel diffusion test (DG). Serovar 4 was the most prevalent (24.5%), followed by serovar 13 (19.8%) and serovar 5 (11.3%). Twenty-nine strains were non-typeable (27.3%). The strains were divided into two groups, depending on whether they were isolated from specific pathological lesions of systemic disease such as polyserositis, arthritis or meningitis (73 cases of 106) or from the lower respiratory tract of pigs suffering from bronchopneumonia (33 cases of 106). Serovars 4 and 13 had a higher prevalence in systemic infection (polyserositis) than in respiratory disease only. Pasteurella multocida (14/106), Streptococcus suis (7/106), Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (4/106), Bordetella bronchiseptica (3/106) and Arcanobacterium pyogenes (3/106) were isolated in association with H. parasuis.
TI  - Phenotypic and PCR-based identification of bacterial strains isolated from patients with suspected streptococcus suis infection in northern Thailand.
AB  - Twenty bacterial strains isolated from the blood of patients with suspected Streptococcus suis infection based on clinical symptoms in northern Thailand between 2009 and 2010 were subjected to phenotypic and genotypic identification. Commercial identification kits and a PCR-based assay targeting the S. suis-specific 16S rDNA sequence correctly identified S. suis isolated from patients in northern Thailand; however, there was a risk of misidentifying S. gallolyticus as S. suis using a PCR assay targeting the S. suis-specific house keeping gene encoding glutamate dehydrogenase. This is the first paper to report S. gallolyticus infection in humans in Thailand.
TI  - Characterization and determination of holin protein of Streptococcus suis bacteriophage SMP in heterologous host.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Holins are a group of phage-encoded membrane proteins that control access of phage-encoded endolysins to the peptidoglycan, and thereby trigger the lysis process at a precise time point as the 'lysis clock'. SMP is an isolated and characterized Streptococcus suis lytic phage. The aims of this study were to determine the holin gene, HolSMP, in the genome of SMP, and characterized the function of holin, HolSMP, in phage infection. RESULTS: HolSMP was predicted to encode a small membrane protein with three hydrophobic transmembrane helices. During SMP infections, HolSMP was transcribed as a late gene and HolSMP accumulated harmlessly in the cell membrane before host cell lysis. Expression of HolSMP in Escherichia coli induced an increase in cytoplasmic membrane permeability, an inhibition of host cell growth and significant cell lysis in the presence of LySMP, the endolysin of phage SMP. HolSMP was prematurely triggered by the addition of energy poison to the medium. HolSMP complemented the defective lambda S allele in a non-suppressing Escherichia coli strain to produce phage plaques. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that HolSMP is the holin protein of phage SMP and a two-step lysis system exists in SMP.
TI  - Inactivation of the sodA gene of Streptococcus suis type 2 encoding superoxide dismutase leads to reduced virulence to mice.
AB  - Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is a virulence factor of certain pathogenic bacteria by diminishing the effect of oxidative burst of phagocytic cells. Earlier reports indicated the presence of manganese-cofactored SOD in Streptococcus suis type 2 (SS2). However, the biological role of SOD and its coding sequence in SS2 has not yet been characterized. The SSU1356-ORF of a clinical SS2 strain ZJ081101 encodes a protein of 201 amino acids with 81-88% identity to SodA of other Streptococcus spp. A sod deletion mutant (Deltasod) from the clinical strain was constructed. SOD activity was absent in the cell extract from the Deltasod mutant, but present in that from the wild-type or the sod-complemented (CDeltasod) strain. The Deltasod mutant was more susceptible to oxidative stresses induced by hydrogen peroxide or paraquat. Survival of the sod deletion mutant in RAW264.7 macrophages was only half of that of the wild-type strain. Deletion of sod significantly attenuated virulence of SS2 to mice. Effects of such genetic deletion were complementable using the strain CDeltasod. The co-inoculation experiment in mice revealed that the Deltasod mutant was far more easily cleared from the body than the wild-type strain as shown by about 3-log reduction of its infection potential in blood and tissues. In summary, we reveal an important role of SOD in pathogenesis of S. suis type 2, most probably by scavenging reactive oxygen species from macrophages.
TI  - Identification of candidate susceptibility and resistance genes of mice infected  with Streptococcus suis type 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis type 2 (SS2) is an important swine pathogen and zoonosis agent. A/J mice are significantly more susceptible than C57BL/6 (B6) mice to SS2 infection, but the genetic basis is largely unknown. Here, alterations in gene expression in SS2 (strain HA9801)-infected mice were identified using Illumina mouse BeadChips. Microarray analysis revealed 3,692 genes differentially expressed in peritoneal macrophages between A/J and B6 mice due to SS2 infection. Between SS2-infected A/J and control A/J mice, 2646 genes were differentially expressed (1469 upregulated; 1177 downregulated). Between SS2-infected B6 and control B6 mice, 1449 genes were differentially expressed (778 upregulated; 671 downregulated). These genes were analyzed for significant Gene Ontology (GO) categories and signaling pathways using the Kyoto Encylopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database to generate a signaling network. Upregulated genes in A/J and B6 mice were related to response to bacteria, immune response, positive regulation of B cell receptor signaling pathway, type I interferon biosynthesis, defense and inflammatory responses. Additionally, upregulated genes in SS2-infected B6 mice were involved in antigen processing and presentation of exogenous peptides, peptide antigen stabilization, lymphocyte differentiation regulation, positive regulation of monocyte differentiation, antigen receptor-mediated signaling pathway and positive regulation of phagocytosis. Downregulated genes in SS2-infected B6 mice played roles in glycolysis, carbohydrate metabolic process, amino acid metabolism, behavior and muscle regulation. Microarray results were verified by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) of 14 representative deregulated genes. Four genes differentially expressed between SS2-infected A/J and B6 mice, toll-like receptor 2 (Tlr2), tumor necrosis factor (Tnf), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (Mmp9) and pentraxin 3 (Ptx3), were previously implicated in the response to S. suis infection. This study identified candidate genes that may influence susceptibility or resistance to SS2 infection in A/J and B6 mice, providing further validation of these models and contributing to understanding of S. suis pathogenic mechanisms.
TI  - Severe cochlear inflammation and vestibular syndrome in an experimental model of  Streptococcus suis infection in mice.
AB  - Hearing impairment is a common and frequently permanent sequel of Streptococcus suis meningitis in humans. Nevertheless, mechanisms underlying the development of cochlear damage have not been addressed so far. In the present work, we characterized a mouse model of suppurative labyrinthitis and meningitis induced by a systemic infection with S. suis and studied the impact of the injected bacterial dosage on the progression of such inflammatory events. We observed that high infection doses of bacteria lead to sustained bacteremia, with an increase in the permeability of the blood-labyrinth and blood-brain barriers, causing suppurative labyrinthitis and meningitis, respectively. However, in mice infected with a low dose of S. suis, bacteria disappeared quickly from blood, hence, cochlear inflammation and meningitis were not consistent features. This model of S. suis infection seems ideal to evaluate novel drugs that may help alleviate the negative consequences of such important sequelae of S. suis-induced meningitis and labyrinthitis.
TI  - Population-based study of Streptococcus suis infection in humans in Phayao Province in northern Thailand.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus suis infection in humans has received increasing worldwide recognition. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A prospective study of S. suis infection in humans was conducted in Phayao Province in northern Thailand to determine the incidence and the risk behaviors of the disease in this region in 2010. Thirty-one cases were confirmed. The case fatality rate was 16.1%, and the estimated incidence rate was 6.2 per 100,000 in the general population. The peak incidence occurred in May. The median age of the patients was 53 years and 64.5% were men. Consumption of raw pork products was confirmed in 22 cases and the median incubation period (range) was 2 days (0-11) after consumption of raw pork products. Isolates from 31 patients were confirmed as serotype 2 in 23 patients (74.2%) and serotype 14 in eight patients (25.8%). The major sequence types (STs) were ST1 (n = 20) for serotype 2 and ST105 (n = 8) for serotype 14. The epidemiological analysis suggested three possible clusters, which included 17 cases. In the largest possible cluster of 10 cases in Chiang Kham and its neighboring districts in May, the source of infection in four cases was identified as a raw pork dish served at the same restaurant in this district. Microbiological analysis confirmed that three of four cases associated with consumption of raw pork at this restaurant were attributable to an identical strain of serotype 2 with ST1 and pulsotype A2. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest a high incidence rate of S. suis infection in the general population in Phayao Province in 2010 and confirm a cluster of three cases in 31 human cases. Food safety control should be strengthened especially for raw pork products in northern Thailand.
TI  - Fisher scientific award lecture - the capsular polysaccharides of Group B Streptococcus and Streptococcus suis differently modulate bacterial interactions with dendritic cells.
AB  - Infections with encapsulated bacteria cause serious clinical problems. Besides being poorly immunogenic, the bacterial capsular polysaccharide (CPS) cloaks antigenic proteins, allowing bacterial evasion of the host immune system. Despite the clinical significance of bacterial CPS and its suggested role in the pathogenesis of the infection, the mechanisms underlying innate and, critically, adaptive immune responses to encapsulated bacteria have not been fully elucidated. As such, we became interested in studying the CPS of two similar, but unique, streptococcal species: Group B Streptococcus (GBS) and Streptococcus suis . Both streptococci are well encapsulated, some capsular types are more virulent than others, and they can cause severe meningitis and septicemia. For both pathogens, the CPS is considered the major virulence factor. Finally, these two streptococci are the sole Gram-positive bacteria possessing sialic acid in their capsules. GBS type III is a leading cause of neonatal invasive infections. Streptococcus suis type 2 is an important swine and emerging zoonotic pathogen in humans. We recently characterized the S. suis type 2 CPS. It shares common structural elements with GBS, but sialic acid is alpha2,6-linked to galactose rather than alpha2,3-linked. Differential sialic acid expression by pathogens might result in modulation of immune cell activation and, consequently, may affect the immuno-pathogenesis of these bacterial infections. Here, we review and compare the interactions of these two sialylated encapsulated bacteria with dendritic cells, known as the most potent antigen-presenting cells linking innate and adaptive immunity. We further address differences between dendritic cells and professional phagocytes, such as macrophages and neutrophils, in their interplay with these encapsulated pathogens. Elucidation of the molecular and cellular basis of the impact of CPS composition on bacterial interactions with immune cells is critical for mechanistic understanding of anti-CPS responses. Knowledge generated will help to advance the development of novel, more effective anti-CPS vaccines and improved immunotherapies.
TI  - Virulence factors involved in the pathogenesis of the infection caused by the swine pathogen and zoonotic agent Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is a major swine pathogen responsible for important economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. It is also an emerging zoonotic agent of meningitis and streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome. Since the recent recognition of the high prevalence of S. suis human disease in southeast and east Asia, the interest of the scientific community in this pathogen has significantly increased. In the last few years, as a direct consequence of these intensified research efforts, large amounts of data on putative virulence factors have appeared in the literature. Although the presence of some proposed virulence factors does not necessarily define a S. suis strain as being virulent, several cell-associated or secreted factors are clearly important for the pathogenesis of the S. suis infection. In order to cause disease, S. suis must colonize the host, breach epithelial barriers, reach and survive in the bloodstream, invade different organs, and cause exaggerated inflammation. In this review, we discuss the potential contribution of different described S. suis virulence factors at each step of the pathogenesis of the infection. Finally, we briefly discuss other described virulence factors, virulence factor candidates and virulence markers for which a precise role at specific steps of the pathogenesis of the S. suis infection has not yet been clearly established.
TI  - [Expression, purification and protective antigen analysis of cell wall protein MRP of Streptococcus suis type 2].
AB  - AIM: To amplify the mrp gene of Streptococcus suis type 2 05ZYH33, express it in  E.coli BL21 in order to acquire high purity recombinant protein MRP, then evaluate the protective antigen of recombinant protein MRP. METHODS: Using PCR technology to obtain the product of mrp gene of 05ZYH33, and then cloned it into the expression vector pET28a(+). The recombinant protein was purified by affinity chromatography, later immunized New Zealand rabbit to gain anti-serum, then test the anti-serum titer by ELISA. The opsonophagocytic killing test demonstrated the abilities of protective antigen of MRP. RESULTS: The truncated of MRP recombinant protein in E.coli BL21 expressed by inclusion bodies, and purified it in high purity. After immunoprotection, the survival condition of CD-1 was significantly elevated. The survival rate of wild-type strain 05ZYH33 in blood was apparently decreased after anti-serum opsonophagocyticed, but the mutant delta; MRP showed no differences. CONCLUSION: MRP represent an important protective antigen activity.
TI  - Streptococcus suis II immunoassay based on thorny gold nanoparticles and surface  enhanced Raman scattering.
AB  - An immunoassay based on surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy was developed to detect muramidase released protein (MRP) antibody against Streptococcus suis II (SS2) utilizing thorny gold nanoparticles (tAuNPs) as SERS substrates. Initially, tAuNPs with multi-branches were prepared by the seed-mediated growth method in the absence of templates and surfactants, facilitating p-mercaptobenzoic acid (pMBA) conjugation covalently onto the tAuNPs through S-Au bonds. The obtained immuno-SERS tag affording strong Raman signals made it possible to establish an application of indirect detection of the MRP antibody against SS2 with a sandwich assay at a highly sensitive level. The Raman intensity at 1588 cm(-1) was proportional to the logarithm of the concentration of MRP antibody in the range of 10 pg mL(-1) to 0.1 mug mL(-1). The detection sensitivity was significantly improved to 0.1 pg mL(-1) by using the immuno-SERS tags. Furthermore, the proposed SERS approach was applied to detect MRP antibody in pig serum samples, and the results agreed well with those of ELISA, indicating great potential for clinical application in diagnostic immunoassays.
TI  - Streptococcus suis, an Emerging Drug-Resistant Animal and Human Pathogen.
AB  - Streptococcus suis, a major porcine pathogen, has been receiving growing attention not only for its role in severe and increasingly reported infections in humans, but also for its involvement in drug resistance. Recent studies and the analysis of sequenced genomes have been providing important insights into the S. suis resistome, and have resulted in the identification of resistance determinants for tetracyclines, macrolides, aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, antifolate drugs, streptothricin, and cadmium salts. Resistance gene-carrying genetic elements described so far include integrative and conjugative elements, transposons, genomic islands, phages, and chimeric elements. Some of these elements are similar to those reported in major streptococcal pathogens such as Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus agalactiae and share the same chromosomal insertion sites. The available information strongly suggests that S. suis is an important antibiotic resistance reservoir that can contribute to the spread of resistance genes to the above-mentioned streptococci. S. suis is thus a paradigmatic example of possible intersections between animal and human resistomes.
TI  - Polar invasion and translocation of Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus suis in a novel human model of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier.
AB  - Acute bacterial meningitis is a life-threatening disease in humans. Discussed as  entry sites for pathogens into the brain are the blood-brain and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB). Although human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) constitute a well established human in vitro model for the blood-brain barrier, until now no reliable human system presenting the BCSFB has been developed. Here, we describe for the first time a functional human BCSFB model based on human choroid plexus papilloma cells (HIBCPP), which display typical hallmarks of a BCSFB as the expression of junctional proteins and formation of tight junctions, a high electrical resistance and minimal levels of macromolecular flux when grown on transwell filters. Importantly, when challenged with the zoonotic pathogen Streptococcus suis or the human pathogenic bacterium Neisseria meningitidis the HIBCPP show polar bacterial invasion only from the physiologically relevant basolateral side. Meningococcal invasion is attenuated by the presence of a capsule and translocated N. meningitidis form microcolonies on the apical side of HIBCPP opposite of sites of entry. As a functionally relevant human model of the BCSFB the HIBCPP offer a wide range of options for analysis of disease-related mechanisms at the choroid plexus epithelium, especially involving human pathogens.
TI  - Characterization and functional analysis of atl, a novel gene encoding autolysin  in Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S. suis 2) is an important swine and human pathogen responsible for septicemia and meningitis. A novel gene, designated atl and encoding a major autolysin of S. suis 2 virulent strain HA9801, was identified and characterized in this study. The Atl protein contains 1,025 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 113 kDa and has a conserved N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase domain. Recombinant Atl was expressed in Escherichia coli, and its bacteriolytic and fibronectin-binding activities were confirmed by zymography and Western affinity blotting. Two bacteriolytic bands were shown in the sodium dodecyl sulfate extracts of HA9801, while both were absent from the atl inactivated mutant. Cell chains of the mutant strain became longer than that of the parental strain. In the autolysis assay, HA9801 decreased to 20% of the initial optical density (OD) value, while the mutant strain had almost no autolytic activity. The biofilm capacity of the atl mutant was reduced approximately 30% compared to the parental strain. In the zebrafish infection model, the 50% lethal dose of the mutant strain was increased up to 5-fold. Furthermore, the adherence to HEp-2 cells of the atl mutant was 50% less than that of the parental strain. Based on the functional analysis of the recombinant Atl and observed effects of atl inactivation on HA9801, we conclude that Atl is a major autolysin of HA9801. It takes part in cell autolysis, separation of daughter cells, biofilm formation, fibronectin-binding activity, cell adhesion, and pathogenesis of HA9801.
TI  - Inhibition of bacterial carbonic anhydrases and zinc proteases: from orphan targets to innovative new antibiotic drugs.
AB  - Zinc-containing enzymes, such as carbonic anhydrases (CAs) and metalloproteases (MPs) play critical functions in bacteria, being involved in various steps of their life cycle, which are important for survival, colonization, acquisition of nutrients for growth and proliferation, facilitation of dissemination, invasion and pathogenicity. The development of resistance to many classes of clinically used antibiotics emphasizes the need of new antibacterial drug targets to be explored. There is a wealth of data regarding bacterial CAs and zinc MPs present in many pathogenic species, such as Neisseria spp., Helycobacter pylori Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Brucella spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria spp, Vibrio spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Legionella pneumophila, Streptomyces spp., Clostridium spp., Enterococcus spp., etc. Some of these enzymes have been cloned, purified and characterized by crystallographic techniques. However, for the moment, few potent and specific inhibitors for bacterial MPs have been reported except for Clostridium histolyticum collagenase, botulinum and tetanus neurotoxin and anthrax lethal factor, which will be reviewed in this article. Bacteria encode alpha-,beta-, and/or gamma-CA families, but up to now only the first two classes have been investigated in some detail in different species. The alpha-CAs from Neisseria spp. and H. pylori as well as the beta-class enzymes from E. coli, H. pylori, M. tuberculosis, Brucella spp., S. pneumoniae, S. enterica and H. influenzae have been cloned and characterized. The catalytic/inhibition mechanisms of these CAs are well understood as X-ray crystal structures are available for some of them, but no adducts of these enzymes with inhibitors have been characterized so far. In vitro and in vivo studies with various classes of inhibitors, such as anions, sulfonamides and sulfamates have been reported. Only for Neisseria spp., H. pylori, B. suis and S. pneumoniae CAs it has been possible to evidence inhibition of bacterial growth in vivo. Thus, bacterial CAs and MPs represent at this moment very promising targets for obtaining antibacterials devoid of the resistance problems of the clinically used such agents but further studies are needed to validate these and other less investigated enzymes as novel drug targets.
TI  - Homologous whole bacterin vaccination is not able to reduce Streptococcus suis serotype 9 strain 7997 transmission among pigs or colonization.
AB  - Streptococcus suis (S. suis) is an important porcine pathogen worldwide, and antibiotics are often applied to treat or prevent clinical signs. Vaccination could be an alternative measure to reduce the abundant use of antimicrobials. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of vaccination with homologues whole bacterin vaccine containing S. suis serotype 9 strain 7997 on transmission of this serotype among pigs and on mucosal colonization. Caesarean derived, colostrum deprived pigs (N=50) were housed pair wise. Thirteen pairs were vaccinated intramuscularly with 2-3x10(9) colony forming units (CFU) inactivated S. suis serotype 9 per dose and alpha-tocopherolactetaat as adjuvant at 3 and 5 weeks of age; twelve pairs served as non-vaccinated controls. At 7 weeks of age, one pig of each pair was intranasally inoculated with 1-2x10(9)CFU of the homologues strain, whereas the other pig of each pair was contact-exposed. Tonsil brushings and saliva swabs were collected for 4 weeks, and tested for the presence of S. suis by bacteriological culture. No differences in number of S. suis in the tonsils or saliva samples or in clinical signs were observed between vaccinated and control pigs. In all pairs, transmission between inoculated and contact exposed pigs occurred, and no difference was observed in rate at which this occurred. The estimated transmission rate parameter beta between vaccinated pigs was beta(v)=5.27/day, and for non-vaccinated pigs beta(nv)=2.77/day (P=0.18). It was concluded that vaccination against S. suis serotype 9 did not reduce transmission, nor colonization and that there were no indications that protection against clinical signs was induced.
TI  - Functional definition of LuxS, an autoinducer-2 (AI-2) synthase and its role in full virulence of Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Quorum sensing is a widespread chemical communication in response to fluctuation  of bacterial population density, and has been implicated into bacterial biofilm formation and regulation of expression of virulence factors. The luxS gene product, S-ribosylhomocysteinase, catalizes the last committed step in biosynthetic pathway of autoinducer 2 (AI-2), a signaling molecule for inter-species quorum sensing. We found a luxS homologue in 05ZYH33, an epidemic strain of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) in China. A luxS null mutant (DeltaluxS) of 05ZYH33 strain was obtained using an approach of homologous recombination. LuxS was determined to be required for AI-2 production in 05ZYH33 strain of S. suis 2. Inactivation of luxS gene led to a wide range of phenotypic changes including thinner capsular walls, increased tolerance to H(2)O(2), reduced adherence capacity to epithelial cells, etc. In particular, loss of LuxS impaired dramatically its full virulence of SS2 in experimental model of piglets, and functional complementation restored it nearly to the level of parent strain. Genome-wide transcriptome analyses suggested that some known virulence factors such as CPS are down-regulated in the DeltaluxS mutant, which might in part explain virulence attenuation by luxS deletion. Similarly, 29 of 71 genes with different expression level were proposed to be targets candidate regulated by LuxS/AI-2-dependent quorum sensing.
TI  - Streptococcus suis: a potential risk factor for salivary gland tumors.
AB  
TI  - Lineage and virulence of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 isolates from North America.
AB  - We performed multilocus sequence typing of 64 North American Streptococcus suis serotype 2 porcine isolates. Strains were sequence type (ST) 28 (51%), ST25 (44%), and ST1 (5%). We identified nonrandom associations between STs and expression of the virulence markers suilysin (SLY), muramidase-relased protein (MRP), and extracellular factor (EF). Expression of pili encoded by the srtF and srtG pilus clusters was also nonrandomly associated with STs. ST1 strains were SLY+ EF+ MRP+ srtF pilus+ srtG pilus-. ST25 strains were SLY- EF- MRP- srtF pilus- srtG pilus+, and most ST28 strains were SLY- MRP+ EF- srtF pilus+ srtG pilus+. ST28 isolates proved essentially nonvirulent in a mouse infection model; ST25 strains showed moderate virulence and ST1 isolates were highly virulent. ST1 is responsible for a high proportion of S. suis disease in humans worldwide. Its presence in North America indicates that potential zoonotic S. suis outbreaks in this continent cannot be disregarded.
TI  - Bacterial pathogens associated with lung lesions in slaughter pigs from 125 herds.
AB  - Relationships between macroscopic lesions and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) detection of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Mhp), Pasteurella multocida (Pm), Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (App), Haemophilus parasuis (Hps) and Streptococcus suis (Ssuis) of the lungs of 3731 slaughter pigs from 125 herds were assessed in France. Pneumonia and pleuritis were the most frequent lesions (69.3% and 15% of the lungs, respectively). Mhp, Pm, App, Ssuis and Hps were detected in 69.3%, 36.9%, 20.7%, 6.4% and 0.99% of the lungs, respectively. Mhp and Pm were associated with pneumonia at both the pig and herd levels. Pleuritis was not associated with any pathogen at the pig level, but was associated with a high percentage of pigs PCR-positive for App at the herd level. Measures focused on control of Mhp, Pm and App should significantly reduce the occurrence of both pneumonia and pleuritis.
TI  - Streptococcus suis capsular polysaccharide inhibits phagocytosis through destabilization of lipid microdomains and prevents lactosylceramide-dependent recognition.
AB  - Streptococcus suis type 2 is a major swine pathogen and a zoonotic agent, causing meningitis in both swine and humans. S. suis infects the host through the respiratory route, reaches the bloodstream, and persists until breaching into the central nervous system. The capsular polysaccharide (CPS) of S. suis type 2 is considered a key virulence factor of the bacteria. Though CPS allows S. suis to adhere to the membrane of cells of the immune system, it provides protection against phagocytosis. In fact, nonencapsulated mutants are easily internalized and killed by macrophages and dendritic cells. The objective of this work was to study the molecular mechanisms by which the CPS of S. suis prevents phagocytosis. By using latex beads covalently linked with purified CPS, it was shown that CPS itself was sufficient to inhibit entry of both latex beads and bystander fluorescent beads into macrophages. Upon contact with macrophages, encapsulated S. suis was shown to destabilize lipid microdomains at the cell surface, to block nitric oxide (NO) production during infection, and to prevent lactosylceramide accumulation at the phagocytic cup during infection. In contrast, the nonencapsulated mutant was easily internalized via lipid rafts, in a filipin-sensitive manner, leading to lactosylceramide recruitment and strong NO production. This is the first report to identify a role for CPS in lipid microdomain stability and to recognize an interaction between S. suis and lactosylceramide in phagocytes.
TI  - Characterization of the Streptococcus suis XerS recombinase and its unconventional cleavage of the difSL site.
AB  - XerC and XerD are members of the tyrosine recombinase family and mediate site-specific recombination that contributes to the stability of circular chromosomes in bacteria by resolving plasmid multimers and chromosome dimers to monomers prior to cell division. Homologues of xerC/xerD genes have been found in many bacteria, and in the lactococci and streptococci, a single recombinase called XerS can perform the functions of XerC and XerD. The xerS gene of Streptococcus suis was cloned, overexpressed and purified as a maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion. The purified MBP-XerS fusion showed specific DNA-binding activity to both halves of the dif site of S. suis, and covalent protein-DNA complexes were also detected with dif site suicide substrates. These substrates were also cleaved in a specific fashion by MBP-XerS, generating cleavage products separated by an 11-bp spacer region, unlike the traditional 6-8-bp spacer observed in most tyrosine recombinases. Furthermore, xerS mutants of S. suis showed significant growth and morphological changes.
TI  - Genetic analysis of the capsular polysaccharide synthesis locus in 15 Streptococcus suis serotypes.
AB  - The capsular polysaccharide (CPS) synthesis locus of 13 Streptococcus suis serotypes (serotype 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 19, 23, 25 and 1/2) was sequenced and compared with that of serotype 2 and 16. The CPS synthesis locus of these 15 serotypes falls into two genetic groups. The locus is located on the chromosome between orfZ and aroA. All the translated proteins in the CPS synthesis locus were clustered into 127 homology groups using the tribemcl algorithm. The general organization of the locus suggested that the CPS of S. suis could be synthesized by the Wzy-dependent pathway. The capsule of serotypes 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 19 and 23 was predicted to be amino-polysaccharide. Sialic acid was predicted to be present in the capsule of serotypes 1, 2, 14, 16 and 1/2. The characteristics of the CPS synthesis locus suggest that some genes may have been imported into S. suis (or their ancestors) on multiple occasions from different and unknown sources.
TI  - Genetic and virulence characterization of Streptococcus suis type 2 isolates from swine in the provinces of Zhejiang and Henan, China.
AB  - This study was aimed to examine the genetic characteristics of 44 Streptococcus suis type 2 (SS2) isolates and the virulence attributes of 23 representative isolates. Multilocus sequence typing revealed five sequence types (ST1, ST7, ST28, ST86, and ST162) with 19 isolates assigned to ST7 (43.2%), 14 to ST1 (31.8%), and 9 to ST28 (20.5%). PCR typing of the pilus gene clusters classified the isolates into three types: A (72.7%), B (22.7%), and N (4.5%). All isolates of pilus types A and N were assigned to the ST1 complex containing ST1, ST7, and ST86, while those of type B belonged to the ST27 complex comprising ST28 and ST162. Only two strains had the putative pathogenicity island 89-kb cluster (89K) and were of type N. The type B strains had a significantly lower adhesion, were more readily killed by macrophage, and had lower virulence to mice than those of types A and N. We conclude that SS2 strains of both ST1 and ST27 complexes, parallel to pilus types A and B, were prevalent in the pig populations in Zhejiang Province, and ST7 and ST1 strains were the predominant genotypes in the diseased pigs with pneumonia.
TI  - The role of toll-like receptors in the pathogenesis of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important agent of swine and human meningitis. Sequence  type (ST) 7 emerged in China and was responsible for the human epidemic caused by S. suis in 2005. The virulence of S. suis ST7 is greater than the wild type pathogenic S. suis, ST1; however, the mechanisms for this increased pathogenicity are unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the role of different toll-like receptors (TLRs) involved in regulating the host response to the S. suis infection and to speculate on differing mechanisms used by ST7 strains to induce disease. Here we compared two ST7 strains isolated in the 2005 Sichuan outbreak to two ST1 strains. Our data show TLR2, 6 and 9 are involved in the recognition of heat-killed S. suis independent of the ST type. We found the TLR-dependent cytokine production differed between the two types of strains using whole cell lysate proteins. TLR6 played a greater role in cytokine production induced by the whole cell lysate proteins from the ST7 strain than in that induced by the ST1 strain lysates. The data suggest that mechanisms of inflammation induced by S. suis strains differ where this will be useful in designing efficient strategies in combating streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome caused by the S. suis ST7 strains.
TI  - Comparative genomic analysis of Streptococcus suis reveals significant genomic diversity among different serotypes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus suis (S. suis) is a major swine pathogen and an emerging zoonotic agent. Serotypes 1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 14 and 1/2 are the most prevalent serotypes of this pathogen. However, almost all studies were carried out on serotype 2 strains. Therefore, characterization of genomic features of other serotypes will be required to better understand their virulence potential and phylogenetic relationships among different serotypes. RESULTS: Four Chinese S. suis strains belonging to serotypes 1, 7, 9 and 1/2 were sequenced using a rapid, high-throughput approach. Based on the 13 corresponding serotype strains, including 9 previously completed genomes of this bacterium, a full comparative genomic analysis was performed. The results provide evidence that (i) the pan-genome of this species is open and the size increases with addition of new sequenced genomes, (ii) strains of serotypes 1, 3, 7 and 9 are phylogenetically distinct from serotype 2 strains, but all serotype 2 strains, plus the serotype 1/2 and 14 strains, are very closely related. (iii) all these strains, except for the serotype 1 strain, could harbor a recombinant site for a pathogenic island (89 K) mediated by conjugal transfer, and may have the ability to gain the 89 K sequence. CONCLUSIONS: There is significant genomic diversity among different strains in S. suis, and the gain and loss of large amount of genes are involved in shaping their genomes. This is indicated by (i) pairwise gene content comparisons between every pair of these strains, (ii) the open pan-genome of this species, (iii) the observed indels, invertions and rearrangements in the collinearity analysis. Phylogenetic relationships may be associated with serotype, as serotype 2 strains are closely related and distinct from other serotypes like 1, 3, 7 and 9, but more strains need to be sequenced to confirm this.
TI  - Microbial ecology of swine farms and PRRS vaccine vaccination strategies.
AB  - The present study investigated the microbial ecology and vaccination strategies against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) in field condition. Four representative farms with a history of PRRS were included in this study. Over the almost 3-year period, the average detection rate was 68.9%, making PRRSV the first most frequently detected virus, followed by porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) (64.2%), pseudorabies virus (PRV) (11.03%) and classical swine fever virus (CSFV) (4.41%). Streptococcus suis (77.92%), Haemophilus parasuis (51.25%) and Escherichia coli (52.39%), Pasteurella multocida (26.77%) were isolated most frequently in association with PRRSV. Under the present microbial ecology, production performances of sows their offspring after mass vaccination with a PRRS attenuated vaccine were evaluated. In addition, large scale PRRS vaccines usage and efficacy were further performed. The results indicated that mass vaccination following our immunization program can improve health status and production performances of both sows (2ml/i.m. booster after 4 weeks, and then immunized quarterly) and their offsprings (1ml/i.m. on 14-18 days of age).
TI  - Application of a bacteriophage lysin to disrupt biofilms formed by the animal pathogen Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Bacterial biofilms are crucial to the pathogenesis of many important infections and are difficult to eradicate. Streptococcus suis is an important pathogen of pigs, and here the biofilm-forming ability of 32 strains of this species was determined. Significant biofilms were completely formed by 10 of the strains after 60 h of incubation, with exopolysaccharide production in the biofilm significantly higher than that in the corresponding planktonic cultures. S. suis strain SS2-4 formed a dense biofilm, as revealed by scanning electron microscopy, and in this state exhibited increased resistance to a number of antibiotics (ampicillin, amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, kanamycin, and rifampin) compared to that of planktonic cultures. A bacteriophage lysin, designated LySMP, was used to attack biofilms alone and in combination with antibiotics and bacteriophage. The results demonstrated that the biofilms formed by S. suis, especially strains SS2-4 and SS2-H, could be dispersed by LySMP and with >80% removal compared to a biofilm reduction by treatment with either antibiotics or bacteriophage alone of less than 20%; in addition to disruption of the biofilm structure, the S. suis cells themselves were inactivated by LySMP. The efficacy of LySMP was not dose dependent, and in combination with antibiotics, it acted synergistically to maximize dispersal of the S. suis biofilm and inactivate the released cells. These data suggest that bacteriophage lysin could form part of an effective strategy to treat S. suis infections and represents a new class of antibiofilm agents.
TI  - Comparative genomics study of multi-drug-resistance mechanisms in the antibiotic-resistant Streptococcus suis R61 strain.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus suis infections are a serious problem for both humans and pigs worldwide. The emergence and increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant S. suis strains pose significant clinical and societal challenges. RESULTS: In our study, we sequenced one multi-drug-resistant S. suis strain, R61, and one S. suis strain, A7, which is fully sensitive to all tested antibiotics. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that the R61 strain is phylogenetically distinct from other S. suis strains, and the genome of R61 exhibits extreme levels of evolutionary plasticity with high levels of gene gain and loss. Our results indicate that the multi-drug-resistant strain R61 has evolved three main categories of resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Comparative genomic analysis of S. suis strains with diverse drug-resistant phenotypes provided evidence that horizontal gene transfer is an important evolutionary force in shaping the genome of multi-drug-resistant strain R61. In this study, we discovered novel and previously unexamined mutations that are strong candidates for conferring drug resistance. We believe that these mutations will provide crucial clues for designing new drugs against this pathogen. In addition, our work provides a clear demonstration that the use of drugs has driven the emergence of the multi-drug-resistant strain R61.
TI  - Large-scale identification of bacteria-host crosstalk by affinity chromatography: capturing the interactions of Streptococcus suis proteins with host cells.
AB  - Protein-protein interactions between bacteria and their hosts are responsible for all types of infection processes. The investigation of the bacteria-host crosstalk can provide a comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis of bacterial disease. Despite scattered efforts in this field, a systematic identification of interactions between host and bacterial proteins remains unavailable. Here, we develop ACSP (affinity chromatography-based surface proteomics), which combines affinity chromatography and shotgun proteomics (LC-MS/MS), to investigate the interactions on a large-scale. Using ACSP, the potential surface interacting proteins (SIPs) of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) were captured by the chromatographic resin, which was immobilized with the native surface molecules of Hep-2 cells. And then 40 potential SIPs were identified from the preys by LC-MS/MS, including 3 SIPs that have been previously reported in the literature. We selected 8 important SIPs and confirmed their ability to adhere to Hep-2 cells. Additionally, 3 newly identified SIPs, or their polyclonal antibodies, were found to significantly inhibit the adherence of SS2 to Hep-2 cells, indicating their essential role in the interaction between SS2 and Hep-2 cells. Using this example, we show that ACSP represents a new valuable tool for investigating the bacteria-host interactions.
TI  - Fluoroquinolone efflux in Streptococcus suis is mediated by SatAB and not by SmrA.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an emerging zoonotic pathogen. With the lack of an effective vaccine, antibiotics remain the main tool to fight infections caused by this pathogen. We have previously observed a reserpine-sensitive fluoroquinolone (FQ) efflux phenotype in this species. Here, SatAB and SmrA, two pumps belonging to the ATP binding cassette (ABC) and the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), respectively, have been analyzed in the fluoroquinolone-resistant clinical isolate BB1013. Genes encoding these pumps were overexpressed either constitutively or in the presence of ciprofloxacin in this strain. These genes could not be cloned in plasmids in Escherichia coli despite strong expression repression. Finally, site-directed insertion of smrA and satAB in the amy locus of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome using ligated PCR amplicons allowed for the functional expression and study of both pumps. Results showed that SatAB is a narrow-spectrum fluoroquinolone exporter (norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin), susceptible to reserpine, whereas SmrA was not involved in fluoroquinolone resistance. Chromosomal integration in Bacillus is a novel method for studying efflux pumps from Gram-positive bacteria, which enabled us to demonstrate the possible role of SatAB, and not SmrA, in fluoroquinolone efflux in S. suis.
TI  - The novel virulence-related gene stp of Streptococcus suis serotype 9 strain contributes to a significant reduction in mouse mortality.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important swine pathogen responsible for a diverse range of diseases. S. suis serotype 2 (SS2) and S. suis serotype 9 (SS9) are the prevalent serotypes in diseased Chinese pigs. Little is known about SS9 virulence factors. Two strains, GZ0565 and SH040917, were isolated from a diseased pig and a healthy pig, respectively. Suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) was used to identify SS9 virulence genes associated with pathogenicity. We identified 30 gene fragments unique to GZ0565, including stp which encodes a serine/threonine protein phosphatase known to affect the virulence and morphology of bacteria. To investigate the role of stp in pathogenesis of SS9, an isogenic stp mutant (Deltastp) and a complementation strain (CDeltastp) were constructed. The results demonstrated that the stp affected the expression of a few genes involving in adhesion and virulence for bacteria. The Deltastp exhibited a significant decrease in HEp-2 cell adherence, compared with the wild type, and a reduced survival ratio in whole blood. The Deltastp was attenuated in a CD1 murine model of infection and its LD50 values was seven-fold higher than the wild type. Our data suggest that stp is involved in the pathogenesis of SS9.
TI  - Immunoproteomic assay of secreted proteins of Streptococcus suis serotype 9 with  convalescent sera from pigs.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important pathogen of pigs. In China, in addition to S.  suis serotype 2, S. suis serotype 9 (SS9) is also a prevalent serotype. There is no vaccine available for SS9. An immunoproteome-based approach was developed to identify SS9 immunogenic proteins for vaccine development. Secreted proteins extracted from SS9 strain GZ0565 were screened by two-dimensional Western blotting using convalescent sera from pigs. Protein spots were excised from preparative gels and were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, which led to the identification of ten immunogenic proteins (sortases, ABC transporter substrate-binding protein-maltose/maltodextrin, ABC transporter periplasmic protein, CHAP domain containing protein, peptidoglycan-binding LysM, elongation factor Tu, elongation factor G, thymidine kinase, molecular chaperone DnaK, hypothetical protein SSU98_2184). These novel immunogenic proteins, which are encoded by genes that are reasonably conserved among SS9 strains, may be developed as antigens for further study of SS9 vaccine.
TI  - Identification of a novel streptococcal adhesin P (SadP) protein recognizing galactosyl-alpha1-4-galactose-containing glycoconjugates: convergent evolution of bacterial pathogens to binding of the same host receptor.
AB  - Bacterial adhesion is often a prerequisite for infection, and host cell surface carbohydrates play a major role as adhesion receptors. Streptococci are a leading cause of infectious diseases. However, only few carbohydrate-specific streptococcal adhesins are known. Streptococcus suis is an important pig pathogen and a zoonotic agent causing meningitis in pigs and humans. In this study, we have identified an adhesin that mediates the binding of S. suis to galactosyl-alpha1-4-galactose (Galalpha1-4Gal)-containing host receptors. A functionally unknown S. suis cell wall protein (SSU0253), designated here as SadP (streptococcal adhesin P), was identified using a Galalpha1-4Gal-containing affinity matrix and LC-ESI mass spectrometry. Although the function of the protein was not previously known, it was recently identified as an immunogenic cell wall protein in a proteomic study. Insertional inactivation of the sadP gene abolished S. suis Galalpha1-4Gal-dependent binding. The adhesin gene sadP was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Characterization of its binding specificity showed that SadP recognizes Galalpha1-4Gal-oligosaccharides and binds its natural glycolipid receptor, GbO(3) (CD77). The N terminus of SadP was shown to contain a Galalpha1-Gal-binding site and not to have apparent sequence similarity to other bacterial adhesins, including the E. coli P fimbrial adhesins, or to E. coli verotoxin or Pseudomonas aeruginosa lectin I also recognizing the same Galalpha1-4Gal disaccharide. The SadP and E. coli P adhesins represent a unique example of convergent evolution toward binding to the same host receptor structure.

TI  - Critical role for Streptococcus suis cell wall modifications and suilysin in resistance to complement-dependent killing by dendritic cells.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an emerging zoonotic agent of septicemia and meningitis. Knowledge on host immune responses toward S. suis and strategies used by this pathogen for subversion of these responses is scarce. Here, S. suis modulation of dendritic cell (DC) functions were assessed for the first time. Using S. suis knockout mutants in capsular polysaccharide (CPS) expression, it was shown that CPS blocks DC phagocytosis and impairs cytokine release by hindering cell wall components. Mutants impaired in D-alanylation of lipoteichoic acid (LTA) or N-deacetylation of peptidoglycan (PG) further demonstrated the importance of cell wall in modulation of DC activation. Notably, LTA/PG modifications were identified as major players in resistance to complement-dependent killing by DCs. Finally, S. suis hemolysin was partially involved in cytokine release and also contributed to bacterial escape of opsonophagocytosis. Overall, S. suis uses its arsenal of virulence factors to modulate DC functions and escape immune surveillance.
TI  - SsPep contributes to the virulence of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is a zoonotic pathogen responsible for a spectrum of disease in pigs and that can be transmitted to humans with fatal consequences. Despite the socioeconomic importance of this infection, the pathogenesis of SS2 is poorly understood. The protein SsPep (05SSU0153) has been characterized as an extracellular protein. A deletion mutant of the gene encoding SsPep showed significantly decreased virulence in the pig infection model. Three groups challenged with different doses 5 x 10(5) CFU, 1 x 10(6) CFU, and 5 x 10(6) CFU of the wild type strain, as the results all the pigs died, while those given the SsPep deletion mutant all survived challenge with 5 x 10(5) CFU and 1 x 10(6) CFU doses; four pig in the high dose group challenged with 5 x 10(6) CFU and two pigs died at last. These findings suggest that SsPep plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of SS2.
TI  - Lgt processing is an essential step in Streptococcus suis lipoprotein mediated innate immune activation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus suis causes invasive infections in pigs and occasionally in humans. The host innate immune system plays a major role in counteracting S. suis infections. The main components of S. suis able to activate the innate immune system likely include cell wall constituents that may be released during growth or after cell wall integrity loss, however characterization of these components is still limited. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: [corrected] A concentrated very potent innate immunity activating supernatant of penicillin-treated S. suis was SDS-PAGE fractionated and tested for porcine peripheral blood mononucleated cell (PBMC) stimulating activity using cytokine gene transcript analysis. More than half of the 24 tested fractions increased IL-1beta and IL-8 cytokine gene transcript levels in porcine PBMCs. Mass spectrometry of the active fractions indicated 24 proteins including 9 lipoproteins. Genetic inactivation of a putative prolipoprotein diacylglyceryl transferase (Lgt) gene resulted in deficient lipoprotein synthesis as evidenced by palmitate labeling. The Lgt mutant showed strongly reduced activation of porcine PBMCs, indicating that lipoproteins are dominant porcine PBMC activating molecules of S. suis. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This study for the first time identifies and characterizes lipoproteins of S. suis as major activators of the innate immune system of the pig. In addition, we provide evidence that Lgt processing of lipoproteins is required for lipoprotein mediated innate immune activation.
TI  - TroA of Streptococcus suis is required for manganese acquisition and full virulence.
AB  - Streptococcus suis causes infections in pigs and occasionally in humans, resulting in manifestations as meningitis, sepsis, arthritis, and septic shock. For survival within the host, S. suis requires numerous nutrients including trace metals. Little is known about the specific proteins involved in metal scavenging in S. suis. In this study we evaluated the role of the putative high-affinity metal binding lipoprotein TroA in metal acquisition and virulence. A mutant strain deficient in the expression of TroA (DeltatroA mutant) was constructed. Growth of the DeltatroA mutant in Todd-Hewitt broth was similar to wild-type growth; however, growth of the DeltatroA mutant in cation-deprived Todd-Hewitt broth and in porcine serum was strongly reduced compared to growth of wild-type bacteria. Supplementing the medium with extra manganese but not with magnesium, zinc, copper, nickel, or iron restored growth to wild-type levels, indicating that TroA is specifically required for growth in environments low in manganese. The DeltatroA mutant also showed increased susceptibility to H2O2, suggesting that TroA is involved in counteracting oxidative stress. Furthermore, the expression of the troA gene was subject to environmental regulation at the transcript level. In a murine S. suis infection model, the DeltatroA mutant displayed a nonvirulent phenotype. These data indicate that S. suis TroA is involved in manganese acquisition and is required for full virulence in mice.
TI  - Bacterial carbonic anhydrases as drug targets: toward novel antibiotics?
AB  - Carbonic anhydrases (CAs, EC 4.2.1.1) are metalloenzymes which catalyze the hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and protons. Many pathogenic bacteria encode such enzymes belonging to the alpha-, beta-, and/or gamma-CA families. In the last decade, the alpha-CAs from Neisseria spp. and Helicobacter pylori as well as the beta-class enzymes from Escherichia coli, H. pylori,Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Brucella spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, and Haemophilus influenzae have been cloned and characterized in detail. For some of these enzymes the X-ray crystal structures were determined, and in vitro and in vivo inhibition studies with various classes of inhibitors, such as anions, sulfonamides and sulfamates reported. Although efficient inhibitors have been reported for many such enzymes, only for Neisseria spp., H. pylori, B. suis, and S. pneumoniae enzymes it has been possible to evidence inhibition of bacterial growth in vivo. Thus, bacterial CAs represent promising targets for obtaining antibacterials devoid of the resistance problems of the clinically used such agents but further studies are needed to validate these and other less investigated enzymes as novel drug targets.
TI  - Streptococcus suis meningitis with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss.
AB  - Streptococcus suis infection is an emerging zoonosis in Asia. The most common disease manifestation is meningitis, which is often associated with hearing loss and cochleovestibular signs. S. suis infection in humans mainly occurs among risk groups that have frequent exposure to pigs or raw pork. Here, we report a case of S. suis meningitis in a 67-yr-old pig carcass handler, who presented with dizziness and sensorineural hearing loss followed by headaches. Gram-positive diplococci were isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood cultures and showed gray-white colonies with alpha-hemolysis. S. suis was identified from CSF and blood cultures by using a Vitek 2 system (bioMerieux, France), API 20 STREP (bioMerieux), and performing 16S rRNA and tuf gene sequencing. Even after receiving antibiotic treatment, patients with S. suis infection frequently show complications such as hearing impairment and vestibular dysfunction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of S. suis meningitis in Korea. Prevention through public health surveillance is recommended, especially for individuals who have occupational exposures to swine and raw pork.
TI  - Loss of capsule among Streptococcus suis isolates from porcine endocarditis and its biological significance.
AB  - Streptococcus suis, particularly serotype 2, is a pathogen of both pigs and humans associated with a wide range of diseases, including meningitis, septicaemia and endocarditis. Among the genes in the capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis (cps) locus, cps2J exists only in the serotype 2 and 1/2 strains; therefore, cps2J-positive strains are suspected to have capsules of serotype 2 or 1/2. Coagglutination using antiserotype 1 and antiserotype 2 sera and/or transmission electron microscopy analysis of 288 cps2J-positive isolates from pigs showed that 32 (100 %) isolates from meningitis were encapsulated, whereas 86 (34 %) of 256 isolates from endocarditis were unencapsulated, indicating that capsule loss often occurred in the isolates from endocarditis. To investigate the genetic backgrounds, we randomly selected 43 unencapsulated isolates and analysed their cps loci by PCR scanning. Among them, 8 and 10 isolates apparently had deletions and insertions, respectively, in cps loci. In addition, a representative unencapsulated isolate and an unencapsulated strain showed adherence to porcine and human platelets, a major virulence determinant for infective endocarditis, to a significantly greater extent than the encapsulated strains. Although the capsule is considered to be an important virulence factor in S. suis, these results suggest that loss of capsular production is beneficial to S. suis in the course of infective endocarditis.
TI  - Real-time PCR for detection of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 in cerebrospinal fluid of human patients with meningitis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is an emerging zoonotic pathogen and is the main cause of acute bacterial meningitis in adult patients in Vietnam. We developed an internally controlled real-time PCR for detection of S. suis serotype 2 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples targeted at the cps2J gene. Sensitivity and specificity in culture-confirmed clinical samples were 100%. The PCR detected S. suis serotype 2 infection in 101 of 238 (42.4%) prospectively collected CSF samples, of which 55 (23%) were culture positive. Culture-negative but PCR-positive CSF samples were significantly associated with the use of antimicrobial agents before admission. S. suis serotype 2 infection was more common than infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis combined. Our results strikingly illustrate the additional diagnostic value of PCR in patients who are pretreated with antimicrobial agents and demonstrate the extremely high prevalence of S. suis infections among Vietnamese adult patients with bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Evaluation of the immunogenicity and the protective efficacy of a novel identified immunogenic protein, SsPepO, of Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S. suis 2) is an important porcine and human pathogen. Some proteins secreted by S. suis 2 are thought to play important roles in the pathogenesis of this organism and in its induced immune response. SsPepO has been previously identified as a secretary immunogenic protein using immunoproteomic techniques. In this study, we confirmed that the sequence of this protein is highly conserved in S. suis 2 and compared it with its homologues in other pathogens. To test the protective efficacy of SsPepO in animal models, the recombinant SsPepO protein was used to immunize mice and pigs. The results demonstrated that it could elicit a strong humoral antibody response and confer significant protection against challenge with a lethal dose of S. suis 2 in mice and pig models. In addition, the antisera against rSsPepO could efficiently inhibit bacterial growth in a whole blood assay and conferred significant protection against S. suis 2 infection in passive immunization experiments. Our findings suggest that SsPepO plays an important role in the pathogenesis of S. suis 2 and would be a promising subunit vaccine candidate.
TI  - Amoeba host model for evaluation of Streptococcus suis virulence.
AB  - The Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus suis is a major swine pathogen worldwide that causes meningitis, septicemia, and endocarditis. In this study, we demonstrate that the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum can be a relevant alternative system to study the virulence of S. suis.
TI  - Genetic diversity of Streptococcus suis isolates as determined by comparative genome hybridization.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus suis is a zoonotic pathogen that causes infections in young piglets. S. suis is a heterogeneous species. Thirty-three different capsular serotypes have been described, that differ in virulence between as well as within serotypes. RESULTS: In this study, the correlation between gene content, serotype, phenotype and virulence among 55 S. suis strains was studied using Comparative Genome Hybridization (CGH). Clustering of CGH data divided S. suis isolates into two clusters, A and B. Cluster A isolates could be discriminated from cluster B isolates based on the protein expression of extracellular factor (EF). Cluster A contained serotype 1 and 2 isolates that were correlated with virulence. Cluster B mainly contained serotype 7 and 9 isolates. Genetic similarity was observed between serotype 7 and serotype 2 isolates that do not express muramidase released protein (MRP) and EF (MRP(-)EF(-)), suggesting these isolates originated from a common founder. Profiles of 25 putative virulence-associated genes of S. suis were determined among the 55 isolates. Presence of all 25 genes was shown for cluster A isolates, whereas cluster B isolates lacked one or more putative virulence genes. Divergence of S. suis isolates was further studied based on the presence of 39 regions of difference. Conservation of genes was evaluated by the definition of a core genome that contained 78% of all ORFs in P1/7. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we show that CGH is a valuable method to study distribution of genes or gene clusters among isolates in detail, yielding information on genetic similarity, and virulence traits of S. suis isolates.
TI  - Microbiological identification and analysis of swine tonsils collected from carcasses at slaughter.
AB  - The primary objective of this 7-month study was to determine the prevalence of porcine pathogens of the tonsil of the soft palate of swine at slaughter. Additional objectives were to determine if sampling the carcasses of normal or abnormal hogs provided different microbiological profiles and if the slaughter plant provides a feasible sampling frame and environment for detecting and monitoring important pathogens in tonsils that have health implications for both swine and humans. A total of 395 samples were collected from 264 farms. Of these, 180 tonsils were collected from normal carcasses and 215 tonsils were collected from carcasses that were diverted to the hold rail. Laboratory testing included bacteriological culture and identification as well as real time-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PPRSV) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for porcine circovirus-2 (PCV-2). The most commonly isolated bacteria included: Streptococcus suis (53.7%), Arcanobacterium pyogenes (29.9%), Pasteurella multocida (27.3%), and Streptococcus porcinus (19.5%). Virus screening revealed evidence of PRRSV and PCV-2 in 22.0% and 11.9% of the samples, respectively. Salmonella Typhimurium and Yersinia enterocolitica were isolated in 0.5% and 1.8% of the samples, respectively. Tonsils collected from the hold rail were more likely to be positive for Staphylococcus hyicus [odds ratio (OR) = 7.51, confidence interval (CI) = 2.89 to 19.54], Streptococcus porcinus (OR = 9.93, CI = 4.27 to 23.10), and Streptococcus suis (OR = 2.16, CI = 1.45 to 3.24). Tonsils collected from abnormal carcasses were less likely to be positive for Staphylococcus aureus (OR = 0.05, CI = 0.005 to 0.482).
TI  - [Expression, purification and activity assay of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 cell wall protein SSU1664].
AB  - AIM: To amplify the SSU1664 gene from Streptococcus suis serotype 2 strain 05ZY,  to express the gene in E.coli, and to evaluate the activities of the recombinant protein. METHODS: SSU1664 gene was amplified by PCR using primers according to 05ZY genome sequences and cloned into the expression vector. The recombinant protein was purified by affinity chromatography and its immunogen activities were tested by Western blot and ELISA. RESULTS: SSU1664 gene could solublely express in E.coli BL21(DE3). Western blot analysis showed that the recombinant protein could react with rat serum immunized with Streptococcus suis, but not with non-immunized rat serum. ELISA assay showed that anti-SSU1664 IgM content in Streptococcus suis-infected patient was significantly higher than that in healthy donors. CONCLUSION: The recombinant SSU1664 protein has immunogen activity and might be one promising Streptococcus suis vaccine candidate and diagnosis marker of Streptococcus suis early infection.
TI  - A novel "open-form" structure of sortaseC from Streptococcus suis.
AB  
TI  - The cps locus of Streptococcus suis serotype 16: development of a serotype-specific PCR assay.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 16 can infect pigs and humans. We describe the identification and the characterization of the capsular polysaccharides synthesis locus of S. suis serotype 16. Using PCR primers flanking the capsular polysaccharides synthesis locus, a 30,101-bp fragment was amplified. Twenty-nine open reading frames related to transcriptional regulation, glycosyl transfer, oligosaccharide repeat unit polymerization, polysaccharide transport, sialic acid synthesis and modification were identified. The data suggests that the serotype 16 capsule is synthesized by a Wzy-dependent pathway. So far, no rapid and sensitive diagnostic method is available for detection of serotype 16 isolates. A serotype specific PCR test for the rapid and sensitive detection of S. suis serotype 16 was developed. Cross hybridization experiments of individual cps genes with chromosomal DNAs of 33 serotypes showed that the cps16G and cps16K genes hybridized with serotype 16 only. Primers based on cps16G were used to develop a serotype 16 specific PCR. The PCR assay was successfully used to identify S. suis serotype 16 in the 99 Chinese S. suis clinical isolates and 8 European isolates.
TI  - Pre-absorbed immunoproteomics: a novel method for the detection of Streptococcus  suis surface proteins.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is a zoonotic pathogen that can cause infections in pigs and humans. Bacterial surface proteins are often investigated as potential vaccine candidates and biomarkers of virulence. In this study, a novel method for identifying bacterial surface proteins is presented, which combines immunoproteomic and immunoserologic techniques. Critical to the success of this new method is an improved procedure for generating two-dimensional electrophoresis gel profiles of S. suis proteins. The S. suis surface proteins identified in this study include muramidase-released protein precursor (MRP) and an ABC transporter protein, while MRP is thought to be one of the main virulence factors in SS2 located on the bacterial surface. Herein, we demonstrate that the ABC transporter protein can bind to HEp-2 cells, which strongly suggests that this protein is located on the bacterial cell surface and may be involved in pathogenesis. An immunofluorescence assay confirmed that the ABC transporter is localized to the bacterial outer surface. This new method may prove to be a useful tool for identifying surface proteins, and aid in the development of new vaccine subunits and disease diagnostics.
TI  - In vitro transcriptome analysis of porcine choroid plexus epithelial cells in response to Streptococcus suis: release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.
AB  - The Gram-positive zoonotic bacterium Streptococcus suis (S. suis) is responsible  for a wide range of diseases including meningitis in pigs and humans. The blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier is constituted by the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus, which execute barrier function also after bacteria have entered the central nervous system (CNS). We show that the bacterial capsule, a major virulence factor, strongly attenuates adhesion of S. suis to the apical side of porcine choroid plexus epithelial cells (PCPEC). Oligonucleotide microarray analysis and quantitative PCR surprisingly demonstrated that adherent wild-type and capsule-deficient S. suis influenced expression of a pronounced similar pattern of genes in PCPEC. Investigation of purified capsular material provided no evidence for a significant role of the capsule. Enriched among the regulated genes were those involved in "inflammatory response", "defense response" and "cytokine activity". These comprised several cytokines and chemokines including the interleukins 6 and 8, which could be detected on protein level. We show that after infection with S. suis the choroid plexus contributes to the immune response by actively producing cytokines and chemokines. Other virulence factors than the bacterial capsule may be relevant in inducing a strong inflammatory response in the CNS during S. suis meningitis.
TI  - Role of a type IV-like secretion system of Streptococcus suis 2 in the development of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S. suis 2) has evolved into a highly invasive pathogen that was found to be the cause of 2 large-scale outbreaks of streptococcus toxic shock syndrome (STSS) in China. However, the mechanism of action of this non-group A streptococcal (GAS) S. suis-caused STSS is still unknown. Previously, we identified a unique pathogenicity island (PAI) designated 89K that is specific to the STSS-causing epidemic strains of S. suis 2. In this study, we further report a functional type IV-like secretion system (T4SS-like system) harbored in the 89K PAI that contributes to the development of STSS. Knockout of the 2 key components (VirD4-89K and VirB4-89K) of the T4SS-like system eliminated the lethality of the highly virulent strain and impaired its ability to trigger host immune response in experimental infection of mice. Our findings provide a new insight into the pathogenesis of STSS caused by the highly pathogenic S. suis 2 isolates.
TI  - A large scale comparative genomic analysis reveals insertion sites for newly acquired genomic islands in bacterial genomes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial virulence enhancement and drug resistance are major threats to public health worldwide. Interestingly, newly acquired genomic islands (GIs) from horizontal transfer between different bacteria strains were found in Vibrio cholerae, Streptococcus suis, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which caused outbreak of epidemic diseases in recently years. RESULTS: Using a large-scale comparative genomic analysis of 1088 complete genomes from all available bacteria (1009) and Archaea (79), we found that newly acquired GIs are often anchored around switch sites of GC-skew (sGCS). After calculating correlations between relative genomic distances of genomic islands to sGCSs and the evolutionary distances of the genomic islands themselves, we found that newly acquired genomic islands are closer to sGCSs than the old ones, indicating that regions around sGCSs are hotspots for genomic island insertion. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results, we believe that genomic regions near sGCSs are hotspots for horizontal transfer of genomic islands, which may significantly affect key properties of epidemic disease-causing pathogens, such as virulence and adaption to new environments.
TI  - Characterization of porcine dendritic cell response to Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is a major swine pathogen and important zoonotic agent causing mainly septicemia and meningitis. However, the mechanisms involved in host innate and adaptive immune responses toward S. suis as well as the mechanisms used by S. suis to subvert these responses are unknown. Here, and for the first time, the ability of S. suis to interact with bone marrow-derived swine dendritic cells (DCs) was evaluated. In addition, the role of S. suis capsular polysaccharide in modulation of DC functions was also assessed. Well encapsulated S. suis was relatively resistant to phagocytosis, but it increased the relative expression of Toll-like receptors 2 and 6 and triggered the release of several cytokines by DCs, including IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12p40 and TNF-alpha. The capsular polysaccharide was shown to interfere with DC phagocytosis; however, once internalized, S. suis was readily destroyed by DCs independently of the presence of the capsular polysaccharide. Cell wall components were mainly responsible for DC activation, since the capsular polysaccharide-negative mutant induced higher cytokine levels than the wild-type strain. The capsular polysaccharide also interfered with the expression of the co-stimulatory molecules CD80/86 and MHC-II on DCs. To conclude, our results show for the first time that S. suis interacts with swine origin DCs and suggest that these cells might play a role in the development of host innate and adaptive immunity during an infection with S. suis serotype 2.
TI  - Decreased mortality of weaned pigs with Streptococcus suis with the use of in-water potassium penicillin G.
AB  - This study evaluated the efficacy of potassium penicillin G in drinking water of  weaned pigs to reduce mortality and spread of infection caused by Streptococcus suis. A total of 896 18-day-old weaned pigs were randomly assigned to either treatment with potassium penicillin G in-water (Treated), or no treatment (Control). The outcomes analyzed were total mortality, mortality due to S. suis, and overall counts of S. suis colonies. The risk of mortality due to S. suis and total mortality were significantly increased in the Control group compared with Treated pigs (P < 0.05). Bacterial culture of posterior pharyngeal swabs indicated that Control pigs were significantly more likely to have >/= 1000 colonies of S. suis per plate than were Treated pigs (P < 0.05). This study demonstrates that potassium penicillin G administered in drinking water is effective in reducing mortality associated with S. suis infection and reducing tonsillar carriage of S. suis.
TI  - NeuA O-acetylesterase activity is specific for CMP-activated O-acetyl sialic acid in Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Several bacteria causing meningitis, such as Escherichia coli K1, Streptococcus suis, Neisseria meningitidis, and group B Streptococci (GBS), produce sialic acid (Neu5Ac)-containing capsular polysaccharide (CPS). Biosynthesis of the Neu5Ac-containing CPS requires CMP-Neu5Ac as substrate, which is synthesized by CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase from CTP and Neu5Ac. In E. coli or GBS, the NeuA protein encoded by the neuA gene has been known encoding a bifunctional enzyme that possesses both CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase and O-acetylesterase activity. In this report, we found that the S. suis NeuA (SsNeuA) was also a bifunctional CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase/O-acetylesterase. Biochemical analyses revealed that the SsNeuA strictly de-O-acetylated CMP-O-acetyl-Neu5Ac, whereas the E. coli NeuA (EcNeuA) preferentially de-O-acetylated CMP-O-acetyl-Neu5Ac. E. coli devoid of NeuA O-acetylesterase activity was unable to produce capsule and only CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase activity of the EcNeuA or SsNeuA could not restore its ability to produce capsule. These results suggest that the O-acetylesterase is essential for the synthesis of capsular Neu5Ac in E. coli, probably in S. suis and GBS as well. Our findings are key to understanding the biosynthesis of capsular Neu5Ac in E. coli, S. suis and GBS.
TI  - Functional analysis of luxS in Streptococcus suis reveals a key role in biofilm formation and virulence.
AB  - Streptococcus suis (SS) is an important pathogen of pigs, responsible for diverse diseases in swine and human. LuxS has been reported to play critical roles in both regulating various behaviors and interspecies quorum sensing in a large spectrum of bacteria. In this study, the luxS deletion mutant of SS was constructed using homologous recombination and its biofilm formation, hemolytic activity, cell adherence, virulence and expression of virulence factors were evaluated. Compared to the parental strain, the biofilm formation and hemolytic activity were significantly decreased in the luxS mutant. The addition of synthetic autoinducer 2 could complement the deficiencies of biofilm production in the mutant strain. Furthermore, its adherence to the HEp-2 cell line was dramatically decreased by 51% compared to the parental strain. Expressions of the known virulence genes gdh, cps, mrp, gapdh, sly, fbps and ef in the mutant strain were decreased by 0.66, 0.61, 0.45, 0.48, 0.29, 0.57 and 0.38, respectively, as quantified by real-time PCR. In a zebrafish infection model, the 50% lethal dose of the mutant strain was increased up to 10-fold. The findings demonstrated that the luxS gene deletion resulted in a significant decrease of bacterial biofilm formation, cell adhesion, hemolytic activity and transcription levels of many virulence genes in SS, and these factors may be associated with the attenuation of virulence in zebrafish. These results suggest that luxS may be involved in the interruption of bacterial communication and biofilm formation that contribute to the virulence of the bacterium.
TI  - Insight into the interaction of metal ions with TroA from Streptococcus suis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The scavenging ability of sufficient divalent metal ions is pivotal for pathogenic bacteria to survive in the host. ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-type metal transporters provide a considerable amount of different transition metals for bacterial growth. TroA is a substrate binding protein for uptake of multiple metal ions. However, the function and structure of the TroA homologue from the epidemic Streptococcus suis isolates (SsTroA) have not been characterized. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we determined the crystal structure of SsTroA from a highly pathogenic streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS)-causing Streptococcus suis in complex with zinc. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis revealed that apo-SsTroA binds Zn(2+) and Mn(2+). Both metals bind to SsTroA with nanomolar affinity and stabilize the protein against thermal unfolding. Zn(2+) and Mn(2+) induce distinct conformational changes in SsTroA compared with the apo form as confirmed by both circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. NMR data also revealed that Zn(2+)/Mn(2+) bind to SsTroA in either the same site or an adjacent region. Finally, we found that the folding of the metal-bound protein is more compact than the corresponding apoprotein. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings reveal a mechanism for uptake of metal ions in S. suis and this mechanism provides a reasonable explanation as to how SsTroA operates in metal transport.
TI  - [Construction and in vitro assay of the sortase BCD geneknock-out mutant of Streptococcus suis 2].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Streptococcus suis 2 is an emerging zoonotic pathogen responsible for  a wide range of life-threatening diseases in pigs and humans. In this study, we investigated the functionality of one of Streptococcus suis 2 sortases, known as the srtBCD. METHODS: To obtain the isogenic mutant srtBCD, the competent cells of 05ZYH33 were subjected to electrotrans formation with recombinant plasmid based on the principle of homologous recombination. The resulting mutant strains was further confirmed by a series of PCR and reverse transcription PCR. To better assess the role of srtBCD gene in the virulence of 05ZYH33, cell adherence assays and experimental infection of mice was adopted. RESULTS: A SrtBCD defective mutant of 05ZYH33 was found to be associated with growth curve upon cultivation in standard laboratory used in our in vitro assays. Furthermore, abolishment of the expression of srtBCD result in impaired interactions of S. suis with human laryngeal epithelial cell line. However, there is no differences when infection mice by the WT and mutant strain. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that srtBCD are critical for the pathogen-host interaction of S. suis 2, but abolishment of srtBCD does not impair the full virulence of 05ZYH33. It is to expect that future study carried out with S. suis 2 to verification the conclusions.
TI  - Understanding Streptococcus suis serotype 2 infection in pigs through a transcriptional approach.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S. suis 2) is an important pathogen of pigs. S suis 2 infections have high mortality rates and are characterized by meningitis, septicemia and pneumonia. S. suis 2 is also an emerging zoonotic agent and can infect humans that are exposed to pigs or their by-products. To increase our knowledge of the pathogenesis of meningitis, septicemia and pneumonia in pigs caused by S. suis 2, we profiled the response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), brain and lung tissues to infection with S. suis 2 strain SC19 using the Affymetrix Porcine Genome Array. RESULTS: A total of 3,002 differentially expressed transcripts were identified in the three tissues, including 417 unique genes in brain, 210 in lung and 213 in PBMC. These genes showed differential expression (DE) patterns on analysis by visualization and integrated discovery (DAVID). The DE genes involved in the immune response included genes related to the inflammatory response (CD163), the innate immune response (TLR2, TLR4, MYD88, TIRAP), cell adhesion (CD34, SELE, SELL, SELP, ICAM-1, ICAM-2, VCAM-1), antigen processing and presentation (MHC protein complex) and angiogenesis (VEGF), together with genes encoding cytokines (interleukins). Five selected genes were validated by qRT-PCR analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We studied the response to infection with S. suis 2 strain SC19 by microarray analysis. Our findings confirmed some genes identified in previous studies and discovered numerous additional genes that potentially function in S. suis 2 infections in vivo. This new information will form the foundation of future investigations into the pathogenesis of S. suis.
TI  - Transcellular migration of neutrophil granulocytes through the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier after infection with Streptococcus suis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A critical point during the course of bacterial meningitis is the excessive influx of polymorphnuclear neutrophils (PMNs) from the blood into the brain. Both paracellular and transcellular routes of leukocyte transmigration through the blood-brain barrier have been described in CNS diseases so far. Thus, we investigated the mechanism of PMN transmigration through the blood-CSF barrier under inflammatory conditions. METHODS: In an "inverted" Transwell culture model of the blood-CSF barrier, the zoonotic agent Streptococcus suis (S. suis) was used to stimulate porcine choroid plexus epithelial cells (PCPECs) specifically from the physiologically relevant basolateral side. Barrier function was analyzed by measuring TEER and TR-dextran-flux, and tight junction morphology was investigated by immunofluorescence. Route and mechanism of PMN transmigration were determined by immunofluorescence, electron microscopy and FACS analysis. Quantitative real time-PCR was used to determine expression levels of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. RESULTS: Here, we show that the transmigration of PMNs through PCPECs was significantly higher after stimulation with TNFalpha or infection with S. suis strain 10 compared to its non-encapsulated mutant. Barrier function was not significantly affected by PMN migration alone, but in combination with S. suis infection. Tight junction and cytoskeletal actin reorganisation were also observed after stimulation with S. suis or TNFalpha. Most strikingly, PMNs preferentially migrated across PCPECs via the transcellular route. Extensive sequential analyses of the PMN transmigration process with Apotome((R))-imaging and electron microscopy revealed that paracellular migrating PMNs stop just before tight junctions. Interestingly, PMNs subsequently appeared to proceed by transcellular migration via funnel-like structures developing from the apical membrane. It is noteworthy that some PMNs contained bacteria during the transmigration process. Flow cytometric and transmigration inhibition studies with integrin-specific antibodies showed that PMN traversal is dependent on CD11b/CD18. Analysis of cell adhesion molecules in PCPECs revealed a significant increase of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression after TNFalpha and S. suis stimulation. CONCLUSION: Our data underline the relevance of the blood-CSF barrier as a gate for leukocyte entry into the CNS and suggest a novel transcellular migration step during the pathogenesis of bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Enzymatic characterization of isocitrate dehydrogenase from an emerging zoonotic  pathogen Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis, a Gram-positive coccus, is an emerging zoonotic pathogen for  both humans and pigs, but little is known about the properties of its metabolic enzymes. Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) is a key regulatory enzyme in the citric acid cycle that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate yielding alpha-ketoglutarate and NAD(P)H. Here, we report the overexpression and enzymatic characterization of IDH from S. suis Serotype 2 Chinese highly virulent strain 05ZYH33 (SsIDH). The molecular weight of SsIDH was estimated to be 74 kDa by gel filtration chromatography, suggesting a homodimeric structure. Additionally, SsIDH was divalent cation-dependent and Mg(2+) was found to be the most effective cation. The optimal pH of SsIDH was 7.0 (Mn(2+)) and 8.5 (Mg(2+)), and the maximum activity was around 30 degrees C (Mn(2+)) and 50 degrees C (Mg(2+)), respectively. Heat inactivation studies showed that SsIDH retained 50% activity after 20 min of incubation at 49 degrees C. Sequence comparison revealed that SsIDH had a significantly homologous identity to bacterial homodimeric IDHs. The recombinant SsIDH displayed a 117-fold (k(cat)/K(m)) preference for NAD(+) over NADP(+) with Mg(2+), and a 80-fold greater specificity for NAD(+) than NADP(+) with Mn(2+). Therefore, SsIDH has remarkably high coenzyme preference toward NAD(+). This current work is expected to shed light on the functions of metabolic enzymes in S. suis and provide useful information for SsIDH to be considered as a possible candidate for serological diagnostics and detection of S. suis infection.
TI  - Complete genome sequence of Streptococcus suis serotype 3 strain ST3.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is a zoonotic pathogen causing economic loss in the swine industry and is also a threat to human health. To date, the mechanism of pathogenesis is not fully understood. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of S. suis strain ST3 of serotype 3, which provides opportunities to reveal genetic basis of infection of S. suis non-serotype 2 strains.
TI  - Meningitis, sepsis and endocarditis among workers occupationally exposed to pigs.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Workers exposed to pigs can develop meningitis, sepsis or endocarditis due to infection with Streptococcus suis transmitted from pigs to man. AIMS: To estimate the risk of these diseases. METHODS: We used the Occupational Hospitalization Register (OHR) which holds information about occupation and hospital treatments for all adults in Denmark. A dynamic population of male workers exposed to pigs was identified every year from 1995 to 2006 by occupational and industrial groups. First hospital treatment or death in the following year due to meningitis, sepsis or endocarditis was identified by ICD-10 codes from the OHR. By comparison with all other economically active men in Denmark, the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was calculated for these diseases. RESULTS: Among those exposed, we observed 32 cases of meningitis, sepsis and endocarditis during 140,118 person-years. In the reference group, we observed 2680 cases during 15,209,394 person-years. The SIR of the exposed group was 1.35 (95% CI: 0.95-1.92). Among the 32 cases, 7 cases of meningitis and sepsis were specified as caused by infection with streptococci. The SIR for these seven cases was 2.4 (95% CI: 1.1-5.0). CONCLUSIONS: Our study did not find that workers exposed to pigs had an overall increased risk of developing meningitis, sepsis or endocarditis.
TI  - Expression of plectasin in Pichia pastoris and its characterization as a new antimicrobial peptide against Staphyloccocus and Streptococcus.
AB  - Recombinant plectasin, the first fungus defensin, was expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified, and its physical, chemical and antimicrobial characteristics were studied. Following a 120 h induction of recombinant yeast, the amount of total secreted protein reached 748.63 mug/ml. The percentage of recombinant plectasin was estimated to be 71.79% of the total protein. After purification with a Sephadex G-25 column and RP-HPLC, the identity of plectasin was verified by MALDI-TOF MS. Plectasin exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against the Gram-positive bacteria Staphyloccocusaureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus suis. At a concentration of 2560 mug/ml, this peptide showed approximately equal activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. suis, and S. pneumoniae, when compared to 320 mug/ml vancomycin, 640 mug/ml penicillin, 320 mug/ml vancomycin and 160 mug/ml vancomycin, respectively. In addition, plectasin showed anti-S. aureus activity over a wide pH range of 2.0 and 10.0, a high thermal stability at 100 degrees C for 1h and remarkable resistance to papain and pepsin. The expression and characterization of recombinant plectasin in P. pastoris has potential to treat Streptococcus and Staphyloccocus infections when most traditional antibiotics show no effect on them. Our results indicate that plectasin can be produced in large quantities, and that it has pharmaceutical importance for the prevention and clinical treatment of Staphyloccocus and Streptococcus infections.
TI  - Probing genomic diversity and evolution of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 by NimbleGen tiling arrays.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our previous studies revealed that a new disease form of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) is associated with specific Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) strains. To achieve a better understanding of the pathogenicity and evolution of SS2 at the whole-genome level, comparative genomic analysis of 18 SS2 strains, selected on the basis of virulence and geographic origin, was performed using NimbleGen tiling arrays. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that SS2 isolates have highly divergent genomes. The 89K pathogenicity island (PAI), which has been previously recognized as unique to the Chinese epidemic strains causing STSS, was partially included in some other virulent and avirulent strains. The ABC-type transport systems, encoded by 89K, were hypothesized to greatly contribute to the catastrophic features of STSS. Moreover, we identified many polymorphisms in genes encoding candidate or known virulence factors, such as PlcR, lipase, sortases, the pilus-associated proteins, and the response regulator RevS and CtsR. On the basis of analysis of regions of differences (RDs) across the entire genome for the 18 selected SS2 strains, a model of microevolution for these strains is proposed, which provides clues into Streptococcus pathogenicity and evolution. CONCLUSIONS: Our deep comparative genomic analysis of the 89K PAI present in the genome of SS2 strains revealed details into how some virulent strains acquired genes that may contribute to STSS, which may lead to better environmental monitoring of epidemic SS2 strains.
TI  - The pathogenicity island-like DNA segment associated with Chinese outbreak strain of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is absent in the United States isolates.
AB  - To determine if the 2005 Chinese outbreak strain of Streptococcus suis is circulating in the United States, three different PCR primer-pairs derived from the nucleotide sequences surrounding and internal to the unique pathogenicity island -like DNA segment of the Chinese outbreak strain (strain 05ZYH33) were used to screen 290 swine isolates of S. suis obtained from different locations. The first primer pair amplified an approximately 1000-bp fragment from 47 (16%) of the United States isolates and the second amplified an 1800-bp fragment from 23 (8%) of the isolates. Nucleotide sequences of the amplicons shared identity with those of strain 05ZYH33. The third primer pair amplified a 716-bp amplicon from the DNA of strain 05ZYH33 only. These observations demonstrated that the PAI homologue of strain 05ZYH33 is absent in the United States isolates tested and suggested that the PCR method may be useful for active surveillance to monitor possible spread of the highly invasive strain.
TI  - Genotypic profile of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 and clinical features of infection in humans, Thailand.
AB  - To examine associations between clinical features of Streptococcus suis serotype  2 infections in humans in Thailand and genotypic profiles of isolates, we conducted a retrospective study during 2006-2008. Of 165 patients for whom bacterial cultures of blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or both were positive for S. suis serotype 2, the major multilocus sequence types (STs) found were ST1 (62.4%) and ST104 (25.5%); the latter is unique to Thailand. Clinical features were examined for 158 patients. Infections were sporadic; case-fatality rate for adults was 9.5%, primarily in northern Thailand. Disease incidence peaked during the rainy season. Disease was classified as meningitis (58.9%) or nonmeningitis (41.1%, and included sepsis [35.4%] and others [5.7%]). Although ST1 strains were significantly associated with the meningitis category (p<0.0001), ST104 strains were significantly associated with the nonmeningitis category (p<0.0001). The ST1 and ST104 strains are capable of causing sepsis, but only the ST1 strains commonly cause meningitis.

TI  - Influence of a pig respiratory disease on the pharmacokinetic behaviour of amoxicillin after oral ad libitum administration in medicated feed.
AB  - The pharmacokinetic properties of amoxicillin in healthy and respiratory-diseased pigs were studied, after ad libitum administration of medicated feed. In addition, amoxicillin dose linearity and drug penetration into respiratory tract tissues were evaluated in diseased animals. The respiratory disease involves porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus and bacterial agents such as Pasteurella multocida, Bordetella bronchiseptica and Streptococcus suis. Typical clinical signs and gross lesions of respiratory disease were observed. The plasma pharmacokinetic analysis was performed by means of a noncompartmental approach. After single intravenous bolus administration of amoxicillin to healthy pigs, the steady-state volume of distribution was 0.61 L/kg, the total plasma clearance was 0.83 L/h/kg and the mean residence time was 0.81 h. After oral bolus administration, the mean absorption time was 1.6 h and the peak plasma concentration (3.09 mug/mL) reached at 1.1 h postadministration. The oral bioavailability was 34%. For oral ad libitum administration, plasma concentration-time profiles were related to the feeding behaviour. Plasma concentrations at steady-state were established between 12 and 120 h. The pharmacokinetic parameters calculated (C(maxss) , C(minss) , C(avss) and AUC(24ss) ) showed significantly lower values in healthy pigs compared to diseased animals. This was in accordance with the significantly higher amoxicillin bioavailability (44.7% vs. 14.1%) and longer absorption period observed in diseased pigs. Amoxicillin dose linearity in diseased animals was established in a dose range of 4-18 mg/kg. On the other hand, tissue distribution ratio in diseased animals was 0.65 for bronchial mucosa, 0.48 for lung tissue and 0.38 for lymph nodes. Our results suggest that the pharmacokinetic properties and disposition of amoxicillin can be influenced by the disease state or by related factors such as changes in the gastrointestinal transit.
TI  - Magnetic properties and structural characterization of iron oxide nanoparticles formed by Streptococcus suis Dpr and four mutants.
AB  - Streptococcus suis Dpr belongs to the Dps family of bacterial and archaeal proteins that oxidize Fe(2+) to Fe(3+) to protect microorganisms from oxidative damage. The oxidized iron is subsequently deposited as ferrihydrite inside a protein cavity, resulting in the formation of an iron core. The size and the magnetic properties of the iron core have attracted considerable attention for nanotechnological applications in recent years. Here, the magnetic and structural properties of the iron core in wild-type Dpr and four cavity mutants were studied. All samples clearly demonstrated a superparamagnetic behavior in superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry and Mossbauer spectroscopy compatible with that of superparamagnetic ferrihydrite nanoparticles. However, all the mutants exhibited higher magnetic moments than the wild-type protein. Furthermore, measurement of the iron content with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry revealed a smaller amount of iron in the iron cores of the mutants, suggesting that the mutations affect nucleation and iron deposition inside the cavity. The X-ray crystal structures of the mutants revealed no changes compared with the wild-type crystal structure; thus, the differences in the magnetic moments could not be attributed to structural changes in the protein. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure measurements showed that the coordination geometry of the iron cores of the mutants was similar to that of the wild-type protein. Taken together, these results suggest that mutation of the residues that surround the iron storage cavity could be exploited to selectively modify the magnetic properties of the iron core without affecting the structure of the protein and the geometry of the iron core.
TI  - [Purification and biological activities analysis of streptococcus suis Serotype 2 suilysin].
AB  - AIM: To explore the purification methods of wild-type and recombinant suilysin and to evaluate their biological activities. METHODS: Wild-type suilysin was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, anion-exchange chromatography and hydrophobic chromatography in turn, while recombinant suilysin was first refolded and purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography, and further purified by Thiopropyl Sepharose 6B. The biological activities were evaluated by hemolysis test, cytotoxicity assay. RESULTS: Both prepared wild-type and recombinant suilysin, with purify over 90%, have hemolysis activity and could injure target cells at high concentration while cholesterol could completely inhibit their activities. CONCLUSION: Recombinant suilysin has similar biological activities with wild-type suilysin, and this work contributed to further study the functions of suilysin on pathogenesis of steptococcus suis.
TI  - Identification of genes and genomic islands correlated with high pathogenicity in Streptococcus suis using whole genome tiling microarrays.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important zoonotic pathogen that can cause meningitis and sepsis in both pigs and humans. Infections in humans have been sporadic worldwide but two severe outbreaks occurred in China in recent years, while infections in pigs are a major problem in the swine industry. Some S. suis strains are more pathogenic than others with 2 sequence types (ST), ST1 and ST7, being well recognized as highly pathogenic. We analyzed 31 isolates from 23 serotypes and 25 STs by NimbleGen tiling microarray using the genome of a high pathogenicity (HP) ST1 strain, GZ1, as reference and a new algorithm to detect gene content difference. The number of genes absent in a strain ranged from 49 to 225 with a total of 632 genes absent in at least one strain, while 1346 genes were found to be invariably present in all strains as the core genome of S. suis, accounting for 68% of the GZ1 genome. The majority of genes are located in chromosomal blocks with two or more contiguous genes. Sixty two blocks are absent in two or more strains and defined as regions of difference (RDs), among which 26 are putative genomic islands (GIs). Clustering and statistical analyses revealed that 8 RDs including 6 putative GIs and 21 genes within these RDs are significantly associated with HP. Three RDs encode known virulence related factors including the extracellular factor, the capsular polysaccharide and a SrtF pilus. The strains were divided into 5 groups based on population genetic analysis of multilocus sequence typing data and the distribution of the RDs among the groups revealed gain and loss of RDs in different groups. Our study elucidated the gene content diversity of S. suis and identified genes that potentially promote HP.
TI  - Streptococcus suis causes septic arthritis and bacteremia: phenotypic characterization and molecular confirmation.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is a swine pathogen that causes meningitis, septicemia, pneumonia, and endocarditis. The first case of human S. suis infection was reported in Denmark in 1968, and since then, this infection with has been reported in many countries, especially in Southeast Asia because of the high density of pigs in this region. We report the case of a patient with septic arthritis and bacteremia caused by S. suis. Cases in which S. suis is isolated from the joint fluid are very rare, and to the best of our knowledge, this is first case report of S. suis infection in Korea. The identity of this organism was confirmed by phenotypic characterization and 16S rRNA sequence analysis. An 81-yr-old Korean woman who presented with fever, arthralgia, and headache was admitted to a secondary referral center in Korea. Culture of aspirated joint fluid and blood samples showed the growth of S. suis biotype II, which was identified by the Vitek2 GPI and API 20 Strep systems (bioMerieux, USA), and this organism was susceptible to penicillin G and vancomycin. The 16S rRNA sequences of the blood culture isolates showed 99% homology with those of S. suis subsp. suis, which are reported in GenBank. The patient's fever subsided, and blood and joint cultures were negative for bacterial growth after antibiotic therapy; however, the swelling and pain in her left knee joint persisted. She plans to undergo total knee replacement.

TI  - Slaughterhouse pigs are a major reservoir of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 capable of causing human infection in southern Vietnam.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is a pathogen of major economic significance to the swine industry and is increasingly recognized as an emerging zoonotic agent in Asia. In Vietnam, S. suis is the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in adult humans. Zoonotic transmission is most frequently associated with serotype 2 strains and occupational exposure to pigs or consumption of infected pork. To gain insight into the role of pigs for human consumption as a reservoir for zoonotic infection in southern Vietnam, we determined the prevalence and diversity of S. suis carriage in healthy slaughterhouse pigs. Nasopharyngeal tonsils were sampled from pigs at slaughterhouses serving six provinces in southern Vietnam and Ho Chi Minh City area from September 2006 to November 2007. Samples were screened by bacterial culture. Isolates of S. suis were serotyped and characterized by multi locus sequence typing (MLST) and pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Antibiotic susceptibility profiles and associated genetic resistance determinants, and the presence of putative virulence factors were determined. 41% (222/542) of pigs carried S. suis of one or multiple serotypes. 8% (45/542) carried S. suis serotype 2 which was the most common serotype found (45/317 strains, 14%). 80% of serotype 2 strains belonged to the MLST clonal complex 1,which was previously associated with meningitis cases in Vietnam and outbreaks of severe disease in China in 1998 and 2005. These strains clustered with representative strains isolated from patients with meningitis in PFGE analysis, and showed similar antimicrobial resistance and virulence factor profiles. Slaughterhouse pigs are a major reservoir of S. suis serotype 2 capable of causing human infection in southern Vietnam. Strict hygiene at processing facilities, and health education programs addressing food safety and proper handling of pork should be encouraged.
TI  - Plasma concentrations resulting from florfenicol preparations given to pigs in their drinking water.
AB  - Florfenicol administered through the drinking water has been recommended as a metaphylactic antibacterial drug to control outbreaks of respiratory diseases in pigs caused by strains of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and Pasteurella multocida, yet it is difficult to pinpoint in practice when the drug is given metaphylactically or therapeutically. Further, pigs are likely to reject florfenicol-medicated water, and plasma concentrations of the drug are likely to be marginal for diseases caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. The reported minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for these organisms show a breakpoint of 2 to 3 mug/mL. An experiment was conducted during September and October 2009. One hundred twenty healthy crossbred pigs (Landrace-Yorkshire), weighing 23 +/- 6.2 kg, were used in this trial. They were randomly assigned to 5 groups, with 3 replicates of 8 animals/group. Two commercial preparations of florfenicol were administered through the drinking water at 2 concentrations (0.01 and 0.015%). Water intake was measured before and after medication, and plasma concentrations of florfenicol were determined by HPLC. Considerable rejection of florfenicol-medicated water was observed. However, plasma florfenicol concentrations were of a range sufficient for a methaphylaxis approach to preventing disease by bacteria, with MIC breakpoints of </= 0.25 mug/mL. Decreased efficacy as a metaphylactic medication should be expected for bacteria with MIC >0.25 mug/mL, considering the reported existence of bacteria resistant to florfenicol and the natural resistance of Streptococcus suis or E. coli to this drug.
TI  - Acute-phase proteins: As diagnostic tool.
AB  - The varied reactions of the host to infection, inflammation, or trauma are collectively known as the acute-phase response and encompass a wide range of pathophysiological responses such as pyrexia, leukocytosis, hormone alterations, and muscle protein depletion combining to minimize tissue damage while enhancing the repair process. The mechanism for stimulation of hepatic production of acute-phase proteins is by proinflammatory cytokines. The functions of positive acute-phase proteins (APP) are regarded as important in optimization and trapping of microorganism and their products, in activating the complement system, in binding cellular remnants like nuclear fractions, in neutralizing enzymes, scavenging free hemoglobin and radicals, and in modulating the host's immune response. APP can be used as diagnostic tool in many diseases like bovine respiratory syncytial virus, prostate cancer, bronchopneumonia, multiple myeloma, mastitis, Streptococcus suis infection, starvation, or lymphatic neoplasia. Thus, acute-phase proteins may provide an alternative means of monitoring animal health.
TI  - Toll-like receptor 2 is partially involved in the activation of murine astrocytes by Streptococcus suis, an important zoonotic agent of meningitis.
AB  - The murine astrocyte response to virulent Streptococcus suis, a swine and an emerging human meningitis-causing pathogen, is reported. Albeit astrocytes do not internalize S. suis, all S. suis strains studied enhanced Toll-like receptor (TLR)2 expression and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Cell wall components and hemolysin (suilysin) are shown to be mainly responsible for cell activation. Astrocytes from TLR2 knockout mice presented a partial but significant reduction of S. suis-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These results contribute to increase the knowledge on mechanisms underlying S. suis inflammation in the brain.
TI  - Optimal combinations of acute phase proteins for detecting infectious disease in  pigs.
AB  - The acute phase protein (APP) response is an early systemic sign of disease, detected as substantial changes in APP serum concentrations and most disease states involving inflammatory reactions give rise to APP responses. To obtain a detailed picture of the general utility of porcine APPs to detect any disease with an inflammatory component seven porcine APPs were analysed in serum sampled at regular intervals in six different experimental challenge groups of pigs, including three bacterial (Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Streptococcus suis, Mycoplasma hyosynoviae), one parasitic (Toxoplasma gondii) and one viral (porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus) infection and one aseptic inflammation. Immunochemical analyses of seven APPs, four positive (C-reactive protein (CRP), haptoglobin (Hp), pig major acute phase protein (pigMAP) and serum amyloid A (SAA)) and three negative (albumin, transthyretin, and apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1)) were performed in the more than 400 serum samples constituting the serum panel. This was followed by advanced statistical treatment of the data using a multi-step procedure which included defining cut-off values and calculating detection probabilities for single APPs and for APP combinations. Combinations of APPs allowed the detection of disease more sensitively than any individual APP and the best three-protein combinations were CRP, apoA1, pigMAP and CRP, apoA1, Hp, respectively, closely followed by the two-protein combinations CRP, pigMAP and apoA1, pigMAP, respectively. For the practical use of such combinations, methodology is described for establishing individual APP threshold values, above which, for any APP in the combination, ongoing infection/inflammation is indicated.
TI  - Risk factors of Streptococcus suis infection in Vietnam. A case-control study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus suis infection, an emerging zoonosis, is an increasing  public health problem across South East Asia and the most common cause of acute bacterial meningitis in adults in Vietnam. Little is known of the risk factors underlying the disease. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A case-control study with appropriate hospital and matched community controls for each patient was conducted between May 2006 and June 2009. Potential risk factors were assessed using a standardized questionnaire and investigation of throat and rectal S. suis carriage in cases, controls and their pigs, using real-time PCR and culture of swab samples. We recruited 101 cases of S. suis meningitis, 303 hospital controls and 300 community controls. By multivariate analysis, risk factors identified for S. suis infection as compared to either control group included eating "high risk" dishes, including such dishes as undercooked pig blood and pig intestine (OR(1) = 2.22; 95%CI = [1.15-4.28] and OR(2) = 4.44; 95%CI = [2.15-9.15]), occupations related to pigs (OR(1) = 3.84; 95%CI = [1.32-11.11] and OR(2) = 5.52; 95%CI = [1.49-20.39]), and exposures to pigs or pork in the presence of skin injuries (OR(1) = 7.48; 95%CI = [1.97-28.44] and OR(2) = 15.96; 95%CI = [2.97-85.72]). S. suis specific DNA was detected in rectal and throat swabs of 6 patients and was cultured from 2 rectal samples, but was not detected in such samples of 1522 healthy individuals or patients without S. suis infection. CONCLUSIONS: This case control study, the largest prospective epidemiological assessment of this disease, has identified the most important risk factors associated with S. suis bacterial meningitis to be eating 'high risk' dishes popular in parts of Asia, occupational exposure to pigs and pig products, and preparation of pork in the presence of skin lesions. These risk factors can be addressed in public health campaigns aimed at preventing S. suis infection.
TI  - Complete genome sequence of Streptococcus suis serotype 14 strain JS14.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important zoonotic agent leading to a variety of diseases in swine and can be transmitted to human beings upon close contact. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of S. suis serotype 14 strain JS14 which was isolated from a diseased pig in Jiangsu Province, China.
TI  - Epidemiological characteristics of pulmonary pneumocystosis and concurrent infections in pigs in Jeju Island, Korea.
AB  - Epidemiological characteristics of swine pulmonary Pneumocystis (P.) carinii and  concurrent infections were surveyed on Jeju Island, Korea, within a designated period in 172 pigs submitted from 54 farms to the Department of Veterinary Medicine, Jeju National University. The submitted cases were evaluated by histopathology, immunohistochemistry, PCR/RT-PCR, and bacteriology. P. carinii infection was confirmed in 39 (22.7%) of the 172 pigs. Histopathologically, the lungs had moderate to severe lymphohistioctyic interstitial pneumonia with variable numbers of fungal organisms within lesions. Furthermore, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) co-infection was a common phenomenon (12.8%, 20.5%, and 48.7% were positive for PRRS, PCV-2, or both, respectively, as determined by PCR/RT-PCR). Infection was much more concentrated during winter (December to March) and 53.8% of the infected pigs were 7- to 8-weeks old. In addition, three pigs showed co-infection with bacteria such as Pasteurella multocida and Streptococcus suis. The results of the present study suggest that the secondary P. carinii infection is common following primary viral infection in swine in Korea. They further suggest that co-infection of P. carinii might be enhanced by the virulence of primary pathogens or might have synergistic effects in the pigs with chronic wasting diseases.
TI  - The SspA subtilisin-like protease of Streptococcus suis triggers a pro-inflammatory response in macrophages through a non-proteolytic mechanism.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus suis is a major swine pathogen worldwide that causes meningitis, septicemia, arthritis, and endocarditis. Using animal models, a surface-associated subtilisin-like protease (SspA) has recently been shown to be an important virulence factor for S. suis. In this study, we hypothesized that the S. suis SspA subtilisin-like protease may modulate cytokine secretion by macrophages thus contributing to the pathogenic process of meningitis. RESULTS: Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-differentiated U937 macrophages were stimulated with recombinant SspA prior to monitor cytokine secretion by ELISA. Our results indicated that the recombinant SspA was able to dose-dependently induce IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, CXCL8 and CCL5 secretion in macrophages. The heat-inactivated protease was still able to induce cytokine secretion suggesting a non-proteolytic mechanism of macrophage activation. Using specific kinase inhibitors, evidence were bought that cytokine secretion by macrophages stimulated with the recombinant SspA involves the mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway. While stimulation of macrophages with low concentrations of recombinant SspA was associated to secretion of high amounts of CCL5, the use of recombinant SspA at a high concentration resulted in low amounts of CCL5 detected in the conditioned medium. This was found to be associated with a proteolytic degradation of CCL5 by SspA. The ability of SspA to induce cytokine secretion in macrophages was confirmed using a mutant of S. suis deficient in SspA expression. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study identified a new mechanism by which the S. suis SspA may promote central nervous system inflammation associated with meningitis.
TI  - Role of glucose and CcpA in capsule expression and virulence of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is one of the most important pathogens in pigs and is also an  emerging zoonotic agent. After crossing the epithelial barrier, S. suis causes bacteraemia, resulting in meningitis, endocarditis and bronchopneumonia. Since the host environment seems to be an important regulatory component for virulence, we related expression of virulence determinants of S. suis to glucose availability during growth and to the sugar metabolism regulator catabolite control protein A (CcpA). We found that expression of the virulence-associated genes arcB, representing arcABC operon expression, cps2A, representing capsular locus expression, as well as sly, ofs, sao and epf, differed significantly between exponential and early stationary growth of a highly virulent serotype 2 strain. Deletion of ccpA altered the expression of the surface-associated virulence factors arcB, sao and eno, as well as the two currently proven virulence factors in pigs, ofs and cps2A, in early exponential growth. Global expression analysis using a cDNA expression array revealed 259 differentially expressed genes in early exponential growth, of which 141 were more highly expressed in the CcpA mutant strain 10DeltaccpA and 118 were expressed to a lower extent. Interestingly, among the latter genes, 18 could be related to capsule and cell wall synthesis. Correspondingly, electron microscopy characterization of strain 10DeltaccpA revealed a markedly reduced thickness of the capsule. This phenotype correlated with enhanced binding to porcine plasma proteins and a reduced resistance to killing by porcine neutrophils. Taken together, our data demonstrate that CcpA has a significant effect on the capsule synthesis and virulence properties of S. suis.
TI  - Identification, variation and transcription of pneumococcal repeat sequences.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Small interspersed repeats are commonly found in many bacterial chromosomes. Two families of repeats (BOX and RUP) have previously been identified in the genome of Streptococcus pneumoniae, a nasopharyngeal commensal and respiratory pathogen of humans. However, little is known about the role they play in pneumococcal genetics. RESULTS: Analysis of the genome of S. pneumoniae ATCC 700669 revealed the presence of a third repeat family, which we have named SPRITE. All three repeats are present at a reduced density in the genome of the closely related species S. mitis. However, they are almost entirely absent from all other streptococci, although a set of elements related to the pneumococcal BOX repeat was identified in the zoonotic pathogen S. suis. In conjunction with information regarding their distribution within the pneumococcal chromosome, this suggests that it is unlikely that these repeats are specialised sequences performing a particular role for the host, but rather that they constitute parasitic elements. However, comparing insertion sites between pneumococcal sequences indicates that they appear to transpose at a much lower rate than IS elements. Some large BOX elements in S. pneumoniae were found to encode open reading frames on both strands of the genome, whilst another was found to form a composite RNA structure with two T box riboswitches. In multiple cases, such BOX elements were demonstrated as being expressed using directional RNA-seq and RT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS: BOX, RUP and SPRITE repeats appear to have proliferated extensively throughout the pneumococcal chromosome during the species' past, but novel insertions are currently occurring at a relatively slow rate. Through their extensive secondary structures, they seem likely to affect the expression of genes with which they are co-transcribed. Software for annotation of these repeats is freely available from ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/pathogens/strep_repeats/.
TI  - Incidence and presence of virulence factors of Streptococcus suis infection in slaughtered pigs from Chiang Mai, Thailand.
AB  - This study was designed to determine the incidence of Streptococcus suis infection in slaughtered pigs raised in industrial facility and backyard system in Chiang Mai City, Thailand. A total of 90 tonsils and submaxillary salivary gland/lymph node samples from slaughtered pigs raised in industrial facility and 122 samples from slaughtered pigs raised in backyard system were collected. Isolation and identification of S. suis were conducted using standard bacteriological methods. Farm management and risk factor data were collected by a questionnaire. Serotyping and presence of virulence factor genes, epf, mrp and sly, were determined by multiplex PCR assay. The overall incidence of S. suis in this study was 9% (n = 212) and the incidence is significantly higher in districts located at a greater distance south of Chiang Mai City. S. suis serotype 2 was present more in healthy pigs (43%) than ill pigs (10%). Every S. suis isolate carried mrp and sly and ill pigs carried epf (80%) more than healthy pigs (57%). However, the probability of S. suis serotype 2 with epf+ (0.245) detected in healthy pigs was higher than in ill pigs (0.08) indicating people may have a higher risk of being infected with S. suis from healthy than ill pigs.

TI  - Microarray analyses of THP-1 cells infected with Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S. suis 2) is a pathogen responsible for several diseases in both pigs and humans. To gain more insight into the pathogenesis of this organism, an oligonucleotide (oligo)-based microarray was used to investigate gene expression changes in human monocytic cells (THP-1) in response to exposure to S. suis 2 strain SC19. A total of 328 differentially expressed genes were identified. These differentially expressed genes belonged to a variety of functional categories, including genes involved in apoptosis, immunity, signal transduction, chemokine production and the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Our findings can be of interest for future research.

AB  - Pathogenicity islands (PAIs), a distinct type of genomic island (GI), play important roles in the rapid adaptation and increased virulence of pathogens. 89K is a newly identified PAI in epidemic Streptococcus suis isolates that are related to the two recent large-scale outbreaks of human infection in China. However, its mechanism of evolution and contribution to the epidemic spread of S. suis 2 remain unknown. In this study, the potential for mobilization of 89K was evaluated, and its putative transfer mechanism was investigated. We report that 89K can spontaneously excise to form an extrachromosomal circular product. The precise excision is mediated by an 89K-borne integrase through site-specific recombination, with help from an excisionase. The 89K excision intermediate acts as a substrate for lateral transfer to non-89K S. suis 2 recipients, where it reintegrates site-specifically into the target site. The conjugal transfer of 89K occurred via a GI type IV secretion system (T4SS) encoded in 89K, at a frequency of 10(-6) transconjugants per donor. This is the first demonstration of horizontal transfer of a Gram-positive PAI mediated by a GI-type T4SS. We propose that these genetic events are important in the emergence, pathogenesis and persistence of epidemic S. suis 2 strains.
TI  - Preparation and pharmacokinetics of ceftiofur sodium liposomes in cows.
AB  - The objective of this study was to prepare ceftiofur sodium liposomes and assess  their physical properties, stability, antibacterial effects, and pharmacokinetics. These liposomes appeared as a milky, light yellow suspension with encapsulation efficiency at 57.2 +/- 1.17%, and there were no significant changes in all estimated indexes at 4 degrees C for 90 days. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of liposomes were all 1/4th that of ceftiofur sodium against Streptococcus suis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella enteritidis. Six healthy, adult cows in two treatment groups were dosed intravenously with ceftiofur sodium liposomes and ceftiofur sodium, serial blood samples collected, and plasma concentrations determined by high performance liquid chromatography. Intravenous plasma concentration profiles of liposomes best fit a two-compartment model and the elimination half-life was 2.11 times that of ceftiofur sodium. Thus, this liposome preparation provided therapeutically effective plasma concentrations for a longer duration than with the drug alone, making it more effective and convenient for use in treating bovine mastitis that requires long duration maintenance of therapeutic plasma concentrations.
TI  - The antimicrobial resistance patterns and associated determinants in Streptococcus suis isolated from humans in southern Vietnam, 1997-2008.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus suis is an emerging zoonotic pathogen and is the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in adults in Vietnam. Systematic data on the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of S. suis strains isolated from human cases are lacking. We studied antimicrobial resistance and associated resistance determinants in S. suis isolated from patients with meningitis in southern Vietnam. METHODS: S. suis strains isolated between 1997 and 2008 were investigated for their susceptibility to six antimicrobial agents. Strains were screened for the presence and expression of tetracycline and erythromycin resistance determinants and the association of tet(M) genes with Tn916- like transposons. The localization of tetracycline resistance gene tet(L) was determined by pulse field gel electrophoresis and Southern blotting. RESULTS: We observed a significant increase in resistance to tetracycline and chloramphenicol, which was concurrent with an increase in multi-drug resistance. In tetracycline resistance strains, we identified tet(M), tet(O), tet(W) and tet(L) and confirmed their expression. All tet(M) genes were associated with a Tn916-like transposon. The co-expression of tet(L) and other tetracycline resistance gene(s) encoding for ribosomal protection protein(s) was only detected in strains with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of tetracycline of >/= 64 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that multi-drug resistance in S. suis causing disease in humans in southern Vietnam has increased over the 11-year period studied. We report the presence and expression of tet(L) in S. suis strains and our data suggest that co-expression of multiple genes encoding distinct mechanism is required for an MIC >/= 64 mg/L to tetracycline.
TI  - Induction of protective immune response against Streptococcus suis serotype 2 infection by the surface antigen HP0245.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is an emerging zoonotic pathogen. Prevention  and control of the diseases caused by SS2 bacteria are hampered by the lack of effective vaccines. We report that an in vivo-induced protein HP0245 was located at the cell surface of SS2. The extracellular peptide of HP0245 was produced in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Its immunogenicity was compared with SS2 bacterin. Like SS2 bacterin, protein HP0245(EC) formulated in aluminum hydroxide adjuvant provided 100% protection in mice challenged with a low dose (2 x LD(50) ) of SS2. However, 80% and 50% survival rates were observed in mice vaccinated with HP0245(EC) and SS2 bacterin, respectively, challenged with a high dose (5 x LD(50) ) of SS2. Immunization with HP0245(EC) induced significantly higher IgG2a titers compared with SS2 bacterin, which was more effective for opsonophagocytosis. No obvious histopathological change was found in the HP0245(EC) -vaccinated mice after challenge with the low dose of SS2, whereas a mild lesion was observed in the meninges of the mice vaccinated with SS2 bacterin. Homologous hp0245 genes with the highly conserved coding sequence of the extracellular peptide exist in all sequenced SS2 strains as well as most S. suis reference strains. Thus, HP0245 could be considered as a promising vaccine candidate for SS2.
TI  - Reduced virulence is an important characteristic of biofilm infection of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis 2 (SS2) is a zoonotic pathogen that can participate in biofilm formation to survive in hostile environments. In this study, virulent SS2 strains HA9801 and ZY05719 displayed increased biofilm formation compared with SS2 avirulent strain T15. In addition, a 58% reduction in adherence to HEp-2 cells was observed for HA9801 biofilm cells, compared with HA9801 planktonic cells. The 50% lethal dose (LD(50) ) of biofilm cells was 40-fold greater than that of planktonic cells. Quantification of expression levels of known virulence genes by real-time PCR revealed that the transcription levels of the gdh, cps2 and mrp genes in biofilm cells were downregulated, while the sly and gapdh genes were upregulated. HA9801 biofilm and planktonic vaccines provided 60% and 46% protection, respectively, when challenged with 50 times the LD(50) of the HA9801 strain. These results suggest a possible connection between virulence and the ability of biofilm formation; cell adhesion, transcription levels and virulence properties are different between biofilm cells and planktonic cells. Furthermore, this work offers a novel insight into bacterium infection mechanisms, which suggests that a virulent strain may be able to decrease its virulence by forming a biofilm so that it can achieve persistent infection in vivo.
TI  - Crystal structure of cytotoxin protein suilysin from Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDC) are pore forming toxins. A prototype of the CDC family members is perfringolysin O (PFO), which directly binds to the cell membrane enriched in cholesterol, causing cell lysis. However, an exception of this general observation is intermedilysin (ILY) of Streptococcus intermedius, which requires human CD59 as a receptor in addition to cholesterol for its hemolytic activity. A possible explanation of this functional difference is the conformational variation between the C-terminal domains of the two toxins, particularly in the highly conserved undecapeptide termed tryptophan rich motif. Here, we present the crystal structure of suilysin, a CDC toxin from the infectious swine pathogen Streptococcus suis. Like PFO, suilysin does not require a host receptor for hemolytic activity; yet the crystal structure of suilysin exhibits a similar conformation in the tryptophan rich motif to ILY. This observation suggests that the current view of the structure-function relationship between CDC proteins and membrane association is far from complete.
TI  - Distribution of capsular serotypes and virulence markers of Streptococcus suis isolated from pigs with polyserositis in Korea.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the capsular serotypes and potential virulence factors of Streptococcus suis isolated from pigs with polyserositis. Among the 24 isolates evaluated, serotype 3 [7 (29%) of the isolates] and serotype 4 [5 (21%)] were the most common. The isolates were also studied for the presence of the genes mrp, epf, and sly, which encode muramidase-released protein (MRP), extracellular factor (EF), and suilysin (SLY), respectively. Of the 24 isolates, 8 carried mrp: 4 of serotype 3, 2 of serotype 2, and 2 of serotype 4. One mrp(+) isolate (serotype 2) also carried the epf gene. All 24 isolates carried the sly gene. The serotype and genotype distribution greatly differed from that reported for isolates from pigs with other clinical manifestations of S. suis infection in other countries.
TI  - Endocarditis-associated brain lesions in slaughter pigs.
AB  - Left-sided valvular endocarditis (LSVE) is a common finding in slaughter pigs. The lesion is often associated with renal thromboembolism, but information on embolization to other organs is sparse. This study focuses on the presence and type of endocarditis-associated brain lesions (EABLs). The brains of 20 slaughter pigs with spontaneously arising LSVE and 11 controls were examined by sectioning half of a formalin-fixed brain into 4mm slices for histological examination. The aetiology of the endocarditis was determined by bacteriological and, in some cases, by fluorescence in-situ hybridization examinations. These examinations identified 11 cases of Streptococcus suis, six cases of Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, one Streptococcus spp. and two cases that remained aetiologically undetermined. One of the S. suis cases had a dual infection with S. suis in the aortic valve lesions and Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis in the atrioventricular valve lesions. Renal infarcts were present in eight cases. Focal encephalitis was found in 12 cases, with the number of lesions ranging from one to 11. Most pigs had less than four microscopical lesions. Acute lesions were characterized by focal microabscesses without observable bacteria. Chronic lesions were characterized by astrocytosis and focal accumulation of mononuclear leucocytes. An infarct was observed in one animal. Perivascular inflammation was seen in 14 cases, mostly as two or three lesions, while focal leptomeningitis was found in eight cases. EABLs are therefore common in slaughter pigs with LSVE. The number of lesions per animal is small, which may explain the limited attention paid to this sequela of LSVE. EABLs have rarely been reported in domestic animals and mostly in patients with neurological signs. The frequent occurrence of EABLs in slaughter pigs suggests that this pathology should be investigated in other animal species with LSVE.
TI  - Contribution of the Rgg transcription regulator to metabolism and virulence of Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - The Rgg-like regulators, a family of transcription factors commonly found in many Gram-positive bacteria, play multiple roles, especially in the control of pathogen virulence. Here, we report an rgg homologue from a Chinese isolate, 05ZYH33, of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2). Deletion of the rgg gene in SS2 increased its adhesion to Hep-2 cells and hemolytic activity in vitro. Significantly, inactivation of the rgg gene attenuated SS2 virulence in an experimental piglet infection model. Using DNA microarrays and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, we found that the Rgg regulator affects the transcriptional profile of 15.87% (n = 345) of all of the annotated chromosomal genes, including those involved in nonglucose carbohydrate metabolism, DNA recombination, protein biosynthesis, bacterial defense mechanisms, and others. It was experimentally verified that the deletion of rgg in SS2 reduced the utilization of nonglucose carbohydrates, such as lactose and maltose. In addition, the rgg gene was found to be associated with changes in the bacterial microscopic phenotype and growth curve. These data suggested that Rgg in SS2 is a global transcriptional regulator that plays an important role in promoting SS2 bacterial survival during pathogen-host interaction.
TI  - The minor pilin subunit Sgp2 is necessary for assembly of the pilus encoded by the srtG cluster of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Gram-positive pili are composed of covalently bound pilin subunits whose assembly is mediated via a pilus-specific sortase(s). Major subunits constitute the pilus backbone and are therefore essential for pilus formation. Minor subunits are also incorporated into the pilus, but they are considered to be dispensable for backbone formation. The srtG cluster is one of the putative pilus gene clusters identified in the major swine pathogen Streptococcus suis. It consists of one sortase gene (srtG) and two putative pilin subunit genes (sgp1 and sgp2). In this study, by constructing mutants for each of the genes in the cluster and by both immunoblotting and immunogold electron microscopic analysis with antibodies against Sgp1 and Sgp2, we found that the srtG cluster mediates the expression of pilus-like structures in S. suis strain 89/1591. In this pilus, Sgp1 forms the backbone, whereas Sgp2 is incorporated as the minor subunit. In accordance with the current model of pilus assembly by Gram-positive organisms, the major subunit Sgp1 was indispensable for backbone formation and the cognate sortase SrtG mediated the polymerization of both subunits. However, unlike other well-characterized Gram-positive bacterial pili, the minor subunit Sgp2 was required for polymerization of the major subunit Sgp1. Because Sgp2 homologues are encoded in several other Gram-positive bacterial pilus gene clusters, in some types of pili, minor pilin subunits may contribute to backbone formation by a novel mechanism.
TI  - Streptococcus suis infection induces [corrected] bacterial accumulation in the kidney.
AB  - Although a Streptococcus suis infection was recently expanded, the study of S. suis has not had enough attention. In this study, bacterial kinetics of S. suis were investigated for seven days of infection in a mouse model. Survival rates showed that 5.0 x 10(7) CFU ml(-1) of S. suis infection caused death in 30% of mice subjects. Streptococcal kinetics from 10(4) to 10(7) CFU ml(-1) were detected in the brain, kidney, lung, spleen and urine two days post-infection and still detected in both kidney and urine seven days post-infection. In addition, 5.0 x 10(6) CFU ml(-1) of low dose infection was conducted, showing that S. suis was detected in the kidney seven days post-infection. Expressions of virulence-associated genes (mrp, epf, sly and hyl) were evaluated and results showed that all virulence-associated genes were detected in both spleen and kidney, whereas no detectable bands in either lung and liver two days post-infection. Microscopy demonstrated that S. suis accumulated in the renal cortex side of blood vessels and renal tubules two days post-infection, while S. suis accumulated in the renal tubule seven days post-infection. This is the first report of accumulated S. suis in mice kidney during S. suis infection.
TI  - HtpS, a novel immunogenic cell surface-exposed protein of Streptococcus suis, confers protection in mice.
AB  - Streptococcal histidine triad protein was identified recently as a cell surface-associated protein family. Five members of this family (PhtA, PhtB, PhtD, PhtE and HtpA), derived from Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, have been shown as antigens that confer protection to the host on infection. In this report, a gene sequence highly homologous to htpA and phtD (designated htpS, the histidine triad protein of Streptococcus suis) was identified from S. suis 2 Chinese strain 05ZYH33. Our data revealed that htpS is extremely conserved in S. suis 2 and widely distributed in 83% (29/35) of 35 S. suis serotypes. It was also demonstrated by Western blot and flow cytometry that HtpS is a cell surface-associated protein that was expressed during S. suis 2 infection. An antibody against HtpS could increase the deposition of human complement 3 on S. suis 2 and also enhance the clearance of S. suis 2 in whole blood. In addition, mice could be immunized against S. suis 2 infection and were well protected after immunization with recombinant HtpS.
TI  - Different genetic elements carrying the tet(W) gene in two human clinical isolates of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - The genetic support for tet(W), an emerging tetracycline resistance determinant,  was studied in two strains of Streptococcus suis, SsCA and SsUD, both isolated in Italy from patients with meningitis. Two completely different tet(W)-carrying genetic elements, sharing only a tet(W)-containing segment barely larger than the gene, were found in the two strains. The one from strain SsCA was nontransferable, and aside from an erm(B)-containing insertion, it closely resembled a genomic island recently described in an S. suis Chinese human isolate in sequence, organization, and chromosomal location. The tet(W)-carrying genetic element from strain SsUD was transferable (at a low frequency) and, though apparently noninducible following mitomycin C treatment, displayed a typical phage organization and was named PhiSsUD.1. Its full sequence was determined (60,711 bp), the highest BLASTN score being Streptococcus pyogenes Phim46.1. PhiSsUD.1 exhibited a unique combination of antibiotic and heavy metal resistance genes. Besides tet(W), it contained a MAS (macrolide-aminoglycoside-streptothricin) fragment with an erm(B) gene having a deleted leader peptide and a cadC/cadA cadmium efflux cassette. The MAS fragment closely resembled the one recently described in pneumococcal transposons Tn6003 and Tn1545. These resistance genes found in the PhiSsUD.1 phage scaffold differed from, but were in the same position as, cargo genes carried by other streptococcal phages. The chromosome integration site of PhiSsUD.1 was at the 3' end of a conserved tRNA uracil methyltransferase (rum) gene. This site, known to be an insertional hot spot for mobile elements in S. pyogenes, might play a similar role in S. suis.
TI  - Trigger factor of Streptococcus suis is involved in stress tolerance and virulence.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is an important zoonotic pathogen that causes serious diseases such as meningitis, septicemia, endocarditis, arthritis and septic shock in pigs and humans. Little is known about the regulation of virulence gene expression in S. suis serotype 2. In this study, we cloned and deleted the entire tig gene from the chromosome of S. suis serotype 2 SC21 strain, and constructed a mutant strain (Deltatig) and a complementation strain (CDeltatig). The results demonstrated that the tig gene, encoding trigger factor from S. suis serotype 2 SC21, affects the stress tolerance and the expression of a few virulence genes of S. suis serotype 2. Deletion of the tig gene of S. suis serotype 2 resulted in mutant strain, DeltaTig, which exhibited a significant decrease in adherence to cell line HEp-2, and lacked hemolytic activity. Tig deficiency diminishes stresses tolerance of S. suis serotype 2 such as survive thermal, oxidative and acid stresses. Quantification of expression levels of known S. suis serotype 2 SC21 virulence genes by real-time polymerase chain reaction in vitro revealed that trigger factor influences the expression of epf, cps, adh, rpob, fbps, hyl, sly, mrp and hrcA virulence-associated genes. DeltaTig was shown to be attenuated in a LD50 assay and bacteriology, indicating that trigger factor plays an important part in the pathogenesis and stress tolerance of. S. suis serotype 2 infection. Mutant DeltaTig was 100% defective in virulence in CD1 mice at up to 107 CFU, and provided 100% protection when challenged with 107 CFU of the SC21 strain.
TI  - Histologic and bacteriologic findings in valvular endocarditis of slaughter-age pigs.
AB  - Endocarditis lesions from 117 slaughter pigs were examined pathologically and etiologically in addition to 90 control hearts with cardiac valves. Lesions were located on the valves; however, the lesions had extended to the walls in 21 cases (18%). Lesions predominated on the mitral valve (59%). A total of 28 cases, from which no growth was obtained or a contamination flora was grown, were screened by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for bacteria (general bacterial probe) and probes specific for Streptococcus suis and Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, respectively. Using FISH, an additional 10 cases of endocarditis due to S. suis and E. rhusiopathiae were disclosed. Within lesions, streptococci predominated (53%) followed by E. rhusiopathiae (30%). Distinct features of both the lesions and the shape and localization of bacterial colonies were related to streptococci and E. rhusiopathiae. The propensity for streptococci to be localized on more than 1 valve in single hearts may be because S. suis-infected pigs tend to have been infected for a longer period compared with E. rhusiopathiae. Mineralization of endocarditis lesions was significantly associated with infection by streptococci, and was seen in 71% of the cases, whereas it was present in only 28% of lesions caused by E. rhusiopathiae. In addition, areas with mineralization were significantly correlated to the presence of a granulomatous reaction. Granulomatous endocarditis is likely a result of a foreign body reaction due to dystrophic mineralization. Local proliferation of valvular endothelial cells, found in 9 hearts in the current study, may increase the risk of developing thrombosing endocarditis in pigs.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria isolated from respiratory tract of pigs in  Poland between 2004 and 2008.
AB  - Antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria isolated from nasal swabs and lungs of pigs, to 16 commonly used antibiotics, was determined by disc diffusion test. beta-lactams showed the best activity against Streptococcus suis (S. suis) (> 99% of susceptible strains). The lowest sensitivity of S. suis was evidenced to: tylosin, tetracycline and neomycin (50%, 40% and 25%, respectively). Isolates of Escherichia coli (E. coli) demonstrated the highest susceptibility to cephalosporin (85% strains), gentamicin and norfloxacin (over 74%). The lowest susceptibility of E. coli was demonstrated to tiamulin and penicillin (11.3% and 1.9%, respectively). Over 80% of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (App) strains were susceptible to all antibiotics tested. The highest resistance of App, but demonstrated by below 20% of tested isolates only, was evidenced to neomycin and LxS. Isolates of Pasteurella multocida (Pm), Haemophilus parasuis (Hps) and Arcanobacterium pyogenes (A. pyogenes) were highly susceptible to the most antibiotics included in the analysis. The comparison of the in vitro susceptibility of pathogens to the chemotherapeutics used on Polish farms for the therapy of bacterial infection of pigs within the last five years and the last 10 years, showed an increasing percent of E. coli and S. suis strains resistant to commonly used antibiotics. It is also shown that Pm, Hps, App and A. pyogenes isolates were continuously susceptible to the most chemotherapeutics applied.
TI  - Structural and thermodynamic characterization of metal ion binding in Streptococcus suis Dpr.
AB  - The use of protein cages for the creation of novel inorganic nanomaterials has attracted considerable attention in recent years. Ferritins are among the most commonly used protein cages in nanoscience. Accordingly, the binding of various metals to ferritins has been studied extensively. Dps (DNA-binding protein from starved cells)-like proteins belong to the ferritin superfamily. In contrast to ferritins, Dps-like proteins form 12-mers instead of 24-mers, have a different ferroxidase center, and are able to store a smaller amount of iron atoms in a hollow cavity (up to approximately 500, instead of the approximately 4500 iron atoms found in ferritins). With the exception of iron, the binding of other metal cations to Dps proteins has not been studied in detail. Here, the binding of six divalent metal ions (Zn(2+), Mn(2+), Ni(2+), Co(2+), Cu(2+), and Mg(2+)) to Streptococcus suisDps-like peroxide resistance protein (SsDpr) was characterized by X-ray crystallography and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). All metal cations, except for Mg(2+), were found to bind to the ferroxidase center similarly to Fe(2+), with moderate affinity (binding constants between 0.1x10(5) M(-1) and 5x10(5) M(-1)). The stoichiometry of binding, as deduced by ITC data, suggested the presence of a dication ferroxidase site. No other metal binding sites were identified in the protein. The results presented here demonstrate the ability of SsDpr to bind various metals as substitutes for iron and will help in better understanding protein-metal interactions in the Dps family of proteins as potential metal nanocontainers.
TI  - IgA1 protease contributes to the virulence of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis (S. suis) is a major swine pathogen and emerging zoonotic agent. However, the current understanding of the S. suis pathogenesis of infection remains limited. In the present study, the contribution to the pathogenesis of S. suis was evaluated on IgA1 protease (or iga gene), which has been regarded as a virulence factor of gram-negative pathogenic bacteria and of certain gram-positive pathogenic bacteria. In contrast to the wild type (WT) strain of S. suis serotype 2, the isogenic iga mutant (Deltaiga) constructed by allelic replacement showed significantly decreased lethality to pigs. The present study suggests that IgA1 protease might contribute to S. suis pathogenesis.
TI  - Purification and characterization of the subtilisin-like protease of Streptococcus suis that contributes to its virulence.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is a major swine pathogen that is responsible for severe infections such as meningitis, endocarditis, and septicemia. S. suis is also recognized as a zoonotic agent and expresses several virulence factors. The recently identified subtilisin-like protease (SspA) of S. suis plays an important role in the pathogenicity of this bacterium in animal models. The objective of the present study was to clone, purify, and characterize the SspA of serotype 2 S. suis P1/7. The SSU0757 gene encoding SspA was amplified and a 4798-bp DNA fragment was obtained. It was cloned into the expression plasmid pBAD/HisB and then inserted into Escherichia coli to overproduce the protein. The recombinant protease was purified by chromatography procedures and showed a molecular weight of 170 kDa by SDS-PAGE. Its activity was optimal at pH 7 and at temperatures ranging from 25 degrees C to 37 degrees C. It had a high specificity for the chromogenic substrate succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNa while specific inhibitors of serine proteases inhibited its activity. In addition to degrading gelatin, the protease hydrolyzed the Aalpha chain of fibrinogen, which prevented fibrin formation by thrombin. The recombinant subtilisin-like protease also showed toxicity towards brain microvascular endothelial cells. Lastly, sera from pigs infected with S. suis reacted with the recombinant SspA, indicating that it is produced during infections. In conclusion, the SspA of S. suis shared similarities with subtilisin-like proteases produced by other pathogenic streptococci and may contribute to the pathogenic process of S. suis infections.
TI  - ArgR is an essential local transcriptional regulator of the arcABC operon in Streptococcus suis and is crucial for biological fitness in an acidic environment.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is one of the most important pathogens in pigs and can also cause severe infections in humans. Despite its clinical relevance, very little is known about the factors that contribute to its virulence. Recently, we identified a new putative virulence factor in S. suis, the arginine deiminase system (ADS), an arginine catabolic enzyme system encoded by the arcABC operon, which enables S. suis to survive in an acidic environment. In this study, we focused on ArgR, an ADS-associated regulator belonging to the ArgR/AhrC arginine repressor family. Using an argR knockout strain we were able to show that ArgR is essential for arcABC operon expression and necessary for the biological fitness of S. suis. By cDNA expression microarray analyses and quantitative real-time RT-PCR we found that the arcABC operon is the only gene cluster regulated by ArgR, which is in contrast to the situation in many other bacteria. Reporter gene analysis with gfp under the control of the arcABC promoter demonstrated that ArgR is able to activate the arcABC promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with fragments of the arcABC promoter and recombinant ArgR, and chromatin immunoprecipitation with antibodies directed against ArgR, revealed that ArgR interacts with the arcABC promoter in vitro and in vivo by binding to a region from -147 to -72&emsp14;bp upstream of the transcriptional start point. Overall, our results show that in S. suis, ArgR is an essential, system-specific transcriptional regulator of the ADS that interacts directly with the arcABC promoter in vivo.
TI  - Response of swine spleen to Streptococcus suis infection revealed by transcription analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2), a major swine pathogen and an emerging zoonotic agent, has greatly challenged global public health. Systematical information about host immune response to the infection is important for understanding the molecular mechanism of diseases. RESULTS: 104 and 129 unique genes were significantly up-regulated and down-regulated in the spleens of pigs infected with SS2 (WT). The up-regulated genes were principally related to immune response, such as genes involved in inflammatory response; acute-phase/immune response; cell adhesion and response to stress. The down-regulated genes were mainly involved in transcription, transport, material and energy metabolism which were representative of the reduced vital activity of SS2-influenced cells. Only a few genes showed significantly differential expression when comparing avirulent isogenic strain (DeltaHP0197) with mock-infected samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that highly pathogenic SS2 could persistently induce cytokines mainly by Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) pathway, and the phagocytosis-resistant bacteria could induce high level of cytokines and secrete toxins to destroy deep tissues, and cause meningitis, septicaemia, pneumonia, endocarditis, and arthritis.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of porcine neutrophil secretions.
AB  - Antimicrobial proteins in neutrophil granules exert their bactericidal activity both within the neutrophil phagolysosome and as components of neutrophil extracellular traps. This study evaluated the bactericidal activity of porcine neutrophil secretions against four bacterial pathogens of swine. Porcine neutrophils were treated with or without phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), then the resulting supernatants were incubated with Escherichia coli K-12, Streptococcus suis, Actinobacillus suis, or Pasteurella multocida, and the surviving colony forming units were enumerated. Supernatants of PMA-activated neutrophils killed an average of 95% of E. coli K-12 cells, relative to supernatants from untreated neutrophils. Inhibition of elastase activity using chloromethylketone (CMK) prior to PMA stimulation significantly reduced the bactericidal activity of the neutrophil supernatants; 57% of the PMA-induced bactericidal activity against E. coli K-12 was estimated to be elastase-dependent. The same neutrophil supernatants had lower bactericidal activity against S. suis, A. suis, and P. multocida, with 30%, 36% and 13% reduction in bacterial numbers, respectively. The cathelicidin porcine myeloid antimicrobial peptide (PMAP)-36 and lactotransferrin were among the proteins identified in the supernatants of PMA-stimulated neutrophils by mass spectrometry. These findings imply that elastase-activated proteins, such as cathelicidins, are partially responsible for the bactericidal effect of porcine neutrophil secretions, but non-elastase-dependent proteins such as lactoferrin may also contribute. Further, the secretions of activated neutrophils were effective in killing the avirulent E. coli K-12 but were less effective against the other bacteria tested, suggesting that these pathogens may have evolved mechanisms to resist neutrophil-mediated killing.
TI  - Isolation of Streptococcus suis from the urine of a clinically ill dog.
AB  
TI  - In vitro characterization of the microglial inflammatory response to Streptococcus suis, an important emerging zoonotic agent of meningitis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important swine and human pathogen responsible for septicemia and meningitis. In vivo research in mice suggested that in the brain, microglia might be involved in activating the inflammatory response against S. suis. The aim of this study was to better understand the interactions between S. suis and microglia. Murine microglial cells were infected with a virulent wild-type strain of S. suis. Two isogenic mutants deficient at either capsular polysaccharide (CPS) or hemolysin production were also included. CPS contributed to S. suis resistance to phagocytosis and regulated the inflammatory response by hiding proinflammatory components from the bacterial cell wall, while the absence of hemolysin, a potential cytotoxic factor, did not have a major impact on S. suis interactions with microglia. Wild-type S. suis induced enhanced expression of Toll-like receptor 2 by microglial cells, as well as phosphotyrosine, protein kinase C, and different mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling events. However, cells infected with the CPS-deficient mutant showed overall stronger and more sustained phosphorylation profiles. CPS also modulated inducible nitric oxide synthase expression and further nitric oxide production from S. suis-infected microglia. Finally, S. suis-induced NF-kappaB translocation was faster for cells stimulated with the CPS-deficient mutant, suggesting that bacterial cell wall components are potent inducers of NF-kappaB. These results contribute to increase the knowledge of mechanisms underlying S. suis inflammation in the brain and will be useful in designing more efficient anti-inflammatory strategies for meningitis.
TI  - Characterization of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 blood infections using RT-qPCR  to quantify glutamate dehydrogenase copy numbers.
AB  - This study characterized the dynamic distribution of bacteria in the blood of pigs infected with Streptococcus suis serotype 2 using specific primers and a TaqMan probe designed to amplify the highly conserved S. suis serotype 2 glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) gene sequences. Gene copy numbers were used to determine the concentration of bacteria in the blood of infected pigs over time using established TaqMan real-time quantitative PCR methodologies (RT-qPCR). The results showed that the detection limit of the RT-qPCR was 10 GDH gene copies. The advantages of utilizing this approach are the high levels of specificity, sensitivity and reproducibility. Bacteria were detected in the blood of infected pigs after 24 h post infection and S. suis GDH gene copies in the experimental group were highest (10(4.15)) on day 7 post infection. Data presented in this report demonstrate that the TaqMan RT-qPCR detection method can be used to characterize the dynamic changes occurring during S. suis serotype 2 blood infections in Bama minipigs thereby facilitating research associated with defining pathogenic mechanisms associated with this organism.
TI  - The two-component regulatory system CiaRH contributes to the virulence of Streptococcus suis 2.
AB  - Two-component regulatory systems (TCSs) are widely distributed among bacteria and enable the organisms to make coordinated changes in gene expression in response to a variety of environmental stimuli. In this work, we constructed a mutant strain of the TCS CiaRH and measured its virulence in vitro and in vivo. Compared with the wild type strain, the mutant strain exhibited a significant decrease in adherence to epithelial cells Hep-2 and PIEC. Furthermore, the deletion of CiaRH not only enhanced the bactericidal activity of RAW264.7 macrophage against Streptococcus suis 2, but also increased blood clearance of S. suis 2 in vivo. More importantly, the mutant was attenuated in vivo in CD1 mice and pigs, with reduced mortality, morbidity and impaired bacterial growth observed in specific organs. These results suggest that the CiaRH is required for S. suis 2 virulence.
TI  - Comparative proteomic analyses of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 cell wall-associated proteins.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is a zoonotic pathogen that is distributed throughout the world. Virulence factors and/or markers of the virulent serotype 2 strains have not been fully identified. In this study a simple, rapid, and non-destructive method was used to extract cell wall-associated proteins from SS2 strains. Two virulent strains were compared with one avirulent strain by 2-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE). When the results of the 2DE analyses were combined with the results of mass spectrometry analyses, a total of 40 unique proteins were identified, including 26 antigens (2DE immunoblotting was used as a preliminary study). In addition to a known virulence factor, muramidase-released protein, two new proteins, catabolite control protein A and leucyl aminopeptidase, and nine potential virulence factors were also identified. The formers may be a potential virulence regulator or drug target, and the latter contains plasminogen-binding proteins and molecular chaperones. Our results complemented previous immunoproteomics studies of SS2 strains.
TI  - Carbonic anhydrase inhibition/activation: trip of a scientist around the world in the search of novel chemotypes and drug targets.
AB  - Carbonic anhydrases (CAs, EC 4.2.1.1) are metalloenzymes which catalyze CO(2) hydration to bicarbonate and protons. Five genetically distinct classes are known, which represent an excellent example of convergent evolution. Inhibition of alpha-CAs from vertebrates, including humans, with sulfonamides was exploited clinically for decades for various classes of diuretics and systemically acting antiglaucoma agents, whereas newer inhibitors are used as topically acting antiglaucoma drugs, anticonvulsants, antiobesity, antipain and antitumor agents/diagnostic tools. Recently, novel interesting chemotypes, in addition to the sulfonamides and sulfamates were discovered, such as the phenols, coumarins/thiocoumarins/lacosamide, fullerenes, boronic acids and some protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Furthermore, their detailed mechanism of inhibition has been explained and can be used for the rational drug design of other agents. Such new classes of enzyme inhibitors show promise for designing interesting pharmacological agents and understanding in detail protein-drug interactions at molecular level. CAs belonging to the alpha-, beta-, gamma-, delta- and zeta-families found in many organisms all over the phylogenetic tree and their inhibition were studied ultimately in nematodes, corals, some pathogenic protozoa (Plasmodium falciparum), fungi/yeasts (Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida albicans, C. glabrata, Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and bacteria (Helicobacter pylori, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Brucella suis, Streptococcus pneumoniae), being demonstrated that anti-infectives based on their inhibitors might be obtained. Possible applications for these new chemotypes are envisaged and discussed in detail, based on a chemo-geographical approach which took the author around the world and the chemical space.
TI  - Microarray analysis of temperature-induced transcriptome of Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S. suis S2) is able to cause human infections ranging from superficial wounded skin infections to severe invasive infections such as meningitis and streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome. During its infection cycle, S. suis S2 must acclimatize itself to temperature shift. Herein, a whole-genome DNA microarray was used to investigate the global transcriptional regulation of an invasive strain of S. suis S2 grown to late-exponential phase at 29 degrees C or 40 degrees C relative to 37 degrees C. The differentially regulated genes that were detected included those encoding virulence factors, antigenic proteins, ATP-binding-cassette transporters, and proteins of unknown functions. Our data provided a global profile of gene transcription induced by temperature alteration and shed light on some unforeseen lines for further pathogenesis investigation.
TI  - Immunogenicity of an autogenous Streptococcus suis bacterin in preparturient sows and their piglets in relation to protection after weaning.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important porcine pathogen causing meningitis and other  invasive diseases in piglets of different ages. Application of S. suis serotype 2 bacterins to specific-pathogen-free (SPF) weaning piglets has been demonstrated to protect against the homologous serotype. However, autogenous S. suis bacterins are also applied to sows and suckling piglets in the field. Therefore, comparative evaluation of different bacterin immunization regimes, including sow vaccination, was performed in this study. The main objectives were to determine the immunogenicity of an S. suis bacterin in sows prepartum and its influence on active immunization of piglets. Experimental infection of 6- and 8-week-old weaning piglets was performed to elucidate protective efficacies. Humoral immune responses were investigated by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) measuring muramidase-released protein (MRP)-specific IgG titers and by opsonophagocytosis assays. Bacterin application elicited high MRP-specific IgG titers in the serum and colostrum of sows, as well as opsonizing antibodies. Piglets from vaccinated sows had significantly higher MRP-specific titers than respective piglets from nonvaccinated sows until 6 weeks postpartum. Vaccination of suckling piglets did not result in high MRP-specific titers nor in induction of opsonizing antibodies. Furthermore, neither vaccination of suckling nor of weaning piglets from immunized sows was associated with a prominent active immune response and protection at 8 weeks postpartum. However, protection was observed in respective 6-week-old weaning piglets, most likely because of protective maternal immunity. In conclusion, this study provides the first results suggesting protective passive maternal immunity for S. suis serotype 2 after bacterin vaccination of sows and a strong inhibitory effect on active immunization of suckling and weaning piglets, leading to highly susceptible growers.
TI  - Cell surface characteristics of nontypeable isolates of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is a worldwide cause of various swine infections and is also an important agent of zoonosis. Strains of S. suis are classified according to their serotype, and currently, 35 serotypes are recognized. The aim of this study was to characterize nontypeable isolates of S. suis with regard to their cell surface properties and compare them with serotype 2 strains, the most frequently associated with infections. The seven nontypeable strains of S. suis isolated from infected animals demonstrated a stronger capacity to adhere to a fibronectin-coated polystyrene surface than the serotype 2 isolates. Three nontypeable strains were also tested for their ability to adhere to endothelial cells and were found to attach in higher amounts compared with the serotype 2 isolates. Electron microscopy analysis revealed the absence of a capsule in the seven nontypeable isolates, which correlated with a much higher cell surface hydrophobicity than that of serotype 2 isolates. All nontypeable isolates of S. suis also showed the capacity to form a biofilm while serotype 2 isolates were unable to do so. In conclusion, the nontypeable isolates of S. suis examined in this study possess surface properties different from those of serotype 2 isolates.
TI  - Identification of the tet(B) resistance gene in Streptococcus suis.
AB  - The tetracycline resistance gene, tet(B), has been described previously in gram negative bacteria. In this study tet(B) was detected in plasmid extracts from 17/111 (15%) Streptococcus suis isolates from diseased pigs, representing the first report of this resistance gene in gram positive bacteria.
TI  - Longitudinal study of respiratory infection patterns of breeding sows in five farrow-to-finish herds.
AB  - A longitudinal study was carried out in five French farrow-to-finish herds differently affected by respiratory diseases to describe the carrying and infection patterns of batches of sows to various respiratory pathogens during gestation and lactation. An entire batch of sows was followed during two successive reproduction cycles. Nasal, tonsillar and oro-pharyngeal swabs and blood samples were taken from each sow 9 and 4 weeks before farrowing and 1 and 4 weeks after farrowing. Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus parasuis and Streptococcus suis were detected from swab samples using PCR assays. Blood samples were tested for antibodies against M. hyopneumoniae, A. pleuropneumoniae serotypes 1-9-11 and 2, Porcine Circovirus type-2 (PCV-2) and Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome virus (PRRSV) by ELISA tests. Antibodies against H(1)N(1), H(1)N(2) and H(3)N(2) Swine Influenza Viruses (SIV) of European lineages were tested by hemagglutination inhibition assay. The results indicated that S. suis is widespread among sows (67.1% of PCR-positive sows). A. pleuropneumoniae, P. multocida, and H. parasuis were detected by PCR in 30.9%, 24.6% and 23.4% of the sows, respectively. Antibodies against M. hyopneumoniae were recovered from more than 55% of the sows in all herds whereas the micro-organism was detected in 2.4% of the sows. Although PCV-2 and SIV infections were highly prevalent, the PRRSV infection patterns ranged from no infection in farms mildly affected by respiratory diseases to active circulation in more severely affected herds. The sow population thus constitutes a reservoir for a continuous circulation of respiratory pathogens and needs to be properly considered in control strategies.
TI  - Secondary infection with Streptococcus suis serotype 7 increases the virulence of highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus in pigs.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and Streptococcus suis are common pathogens in pigs. In samples collected during the porcine high fever syndrome (PHFS) outbreak in many parts of China, PRRSV and S. suis serotype 7 (SS7) have always been isolated together. To determine whether PRRSV-SS7 coinfection was the cause of the PHFS outbreak, we evaluated the pathogenicity of PRRSV and/or SS7 in a pig model of single and mixed infection. RESULTS: Respiratory disease, diarrhea, and anorexia were observed in all infected pigs. Signs of central nervous system (CNS) disease were observed in the highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV)-infected pigs (4/12) and the coinfected pigs (8/10); however, the symptoms of the coinfected pigs were clearly more severe than those of the HP-PRRSV-infected pigs. The mortality rate was significantly higher in the coinfected pigs (8/10) than in the HP-PRRSV- (2/12) and SS7-infected pigs (0/10). The deceased pigs of the coinfected group had symptoms typical of PHFS, such as high fever, anorexia, and red coloration of the ears and the body. The isolation rates of HP-PRRSV and SS7 were higher and the lesion severity was greater in the coinfected pigs than in monoinfected pigs. CONCLUSION: HP-PRRSV infection increased susceptibility to SS7 infection, and coinfection of HP-PRRSV with SS7 significantly increased the pathogenicity of SS7 to pigs.
TI  - Cloning, expression, purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of SAICAR synthase from Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Phosphoribosylaminoimidazole-succinocarboxamide synthase (SAICAR synthase) plays  an essential role in the de novo biosynthesis of purine nucleotides. In this study, the SAICAR synthase from Streptococcus suis was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The subsequent product was purified and crystallized using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. The crystals diffracted to 2.8 A resolution and belonged to space group P2, with unit-cell parameters a=70.2, b=52.2, c=153.9 A, beta=102.8 degrees.
TI  - Streptococcus porcorum sp. nov., isolated from domestic and wild pigs.
AB  - Seven isolates of an unidentified Gram-stain-positive, catalase-negative, coccus-shaped organism isolated from domestic and wild pigs were characterized by phenotypic and molecular-genetic methods. Based on cellular morphology and biochemical criteria, the isolates were tentatively assigned to the genus Streptococcus, although the organisms did not appear to correspond to any recognized species. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that the unknown bacterium was phylogenetically closely related to, but distinct from, Streptococcus suis (97.5 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to the type strain). rpoB and sodA sequence analysis showed minimum interspecies divergence from phylogenetically close 16S rRNA gene sequence-based relatives of 13.8 and 18.6 %, respectively. DNA-DNA hybridization of a strain of the unidentified organism demonstrated 8-18 % reassociation with S. suis NCTC 10234(T). The novel bacterium could be distinguished from S. suis and other Streptococcus species using biochemical tests. On the basis of phenotypic and phylogenetic evidence, it is proposed that the unknown isolates from domestic and wild animals be assigned to a novel species of the genus Streptococcus, Streptococcus porcorum sp. nov. The type strain is 682-03(T) ( = CCUG 58479(T) = CECT 7593(T)).
TI  - Microbial communities in the tonsils of healthy pigs.
AB  - The tonsils of mammals such as humans and pigs are colonized with an extensive microbiota and are frequently the site for asymptomatic carriage of bacterial pathogens. The goal of this study was to determine the composition of the microbial community of the tonsils in healthy pigs. Tonsils were collected from eight pigs from two different healthy herds. Samples of the tonsils from each pig were used for culture dependent and culture independent identification of the microbial community. Aerobic cultivation identified Pasteurella multocida, Actinobacillus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus suis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and Escherichia coli from >/= 50% of the pigs in both herds. For culture independent studies, microbial community members were identified by 16S rRNA sequences using the Ribosomal Database Project Pipeline programs developed at Michigan State University. Dominant genera identified by 16S rRNA analysis in pigs from both herds included Actinobacillus, Haemophilus, Pasteurella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, and Prevotella. These genera were detected in nearly every pig regardless of herd. In contrast, there was an asymmetric distribution of minor genera between the two herds, suggesting herd-specific differences in the microbial communities. In addition, we demonstrated primer bias between two frequently used forward primers when targeting the tonsillar community. Our results suggest that the major bacterial community members found in porcine tonsils are the same regardless of herd, while the minor species are unique to each herd. This is the first analysis using 16S rRNA sequence libraries of the composition of microbial communities in the porcine upper respiratory tract.
TI  - A surface protein of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 identified by proteomics protects mice against infection.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is a major Gram-positive swine pathogen, causing also zoonoses. We describe here the immunoprotective activity in an in vivo animal model of a serotype-2 cell wall protein, designated Sat, which was identified by a previously validated proteomics approach consisting of the protease digestion of live bacteria and the selective recovery of exposed domains, followed by LC/MS/MS analysis. Increased survival rate (80%) and decreased bacterial burden were observed in mice immunized with a recombinant Sat fragment, suggesting that this protein is a potential vaccine candidate against serotype-2 infection.
TI  - Pathogenicity and molecular characterization of emerging porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus in Vietnam in 2007.
AB  - In 2007, Vietnam experienced swine disease outbreaks causing clinical signs similar to the 'porcine high fever disease' that occurred in China during 2006. Analysis of diagnostic samples from the disease outbreaks in Vietnam identified porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2). Additionally, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus were cultured from lung and spleen, and Streptococcus suis from one spleen sample. Genetic characterization of the Vietnamese PRRSV isolates revealed that this virus belongs to the North American genotype (type 2) with a high nucleotide identity to the recently reported Chinese strains. Amino acid sequence in the nsp2 region revealed 95.7-99.4% identity to Chinese strain HUN4, 68-69% identity to strain VR-2332 and 58-59% identity to strain MN184. A partial deletion in the nsp2 gene was detected; however, this deletion did not appear to enhance the virus pathogenicity in the inoculated pigs. Animal inoculation studies were conducted to determine the pathogenicity of PRRSV and to identify other possible agents present in the original specimens. Pigs inoculated with PRRSV alone and their contacts showed persistent fever, and two of five pigs developed cough, neurological signs and swollen joints. Necropsy examination showed mild to moderate bronchopneumonia, enlarged lymph nodes, fibrinous pericarditis and polyarthritis. PRRSV was re-isolated from blood and tissues of the inoculated and contact pigs. Pigs inoculated with lung and spleen tissue homogenates from sick pigs from Vietnam developed high fever, septicaemia, and died acutely within 72 h, while their contact pigs showed no clinical signs throughout the experiment. Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus was cultured, and PRRSV was re-isolated only from the inoculated pigs. Results suggest that the cause of the swine deaths in Vietnam is a multifactorial syndrome with PRRSV as a major factor.
TI  - Aerobic bacteria from mucous membranes, ear canals, and skin wounds of feral cats in Grenada, and the antimicrobial drug susceptibility of major isolates.
AB  - In a 2-year period 54 feral cats were captured in Grenada, West Indies, and a total of 383 samples consisting of swabs from rectum, vagina, ears, eyes, mouth, nose and wounds/abscesses, were cultured for aerobic bacteria and campylobacters. A total of 251 bacterial isolates were obtained, of which 205 were identified to species level and 46 to genus level. A commercial bacterial identification system (API/Biomerieux), was used for this purpose. The most common species was Escherichia coli (N=60), followed by Staphylococcus felis/simulans (40), S. hominis (16), S. haemolyticus (12), Streptococcus canis (9), Proteus mirabilis (8), Pasteurella multocida (7), Streptococcus mitis (7), Staphylococcus xylosus (7), S. capitis (6), S. chromogenes (4), S. sciuri (3), S. auricularis (2), S. lentus (2), S. hyicus (2), Streptococcus suis (2) and Pseudomonas argentinensis (2). Sixteen other isolates were identified to species level. A molecular method using 16S rRNA sequencing was used to confirm/identify 22 isolates. Salmonella or campylobacters were not isolated from rectal swabs. E. coli and S. felis/simulans together constituted 50% of isolates from vagina. S. felis/simulans was the most common species from culture positive ear and eye samples. P. multocida was isolated from 15% of mouth samples. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common isolates from nose and wound swabs. Staphylococcus aureus, or S. intemedius/S. pseudintermedius were not isolated from any sample. Antimicrobial drug resistance was minimal, most isolates being susceptible to all drugs tested against, including tetracycline.
TI  - VirA: a virulence-related gene of Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is an important porcine and human zoonotic pathogen. Few virulence factors have been identified and the pathogenesis of infection is not fully understood. We have identified a novel virulence-related gene, virA, of S. suis 2. To investigate its role in pathogenesis, a virA deletion mutant of S. suis 2 wild-type strain ZY458, 458Deltavir, was constructed using suicide vector pSET4s, and a functionally complemented strain 458Deltavir(pvir) was constructed using shuttle plasmid pAT18 containing the virA gene. All rabbits infected with ZY458 and 458Deltavir(pvir) exhibited body weight loss and developed severe clinical symptoms. All 5 rabbits infected with ZY458, and 4 of 5 infected with 458Deltavir(pvir), died within 6 days of infection. In contrast, all 5 rabbits inoculated with 458Deltavir gained weight normally and none developed any clinical symptoms during the entire course monitored. These results indicate that virA plays an important role in the pathogenicity of S. suis serotype 2. To investigate the virA gene further, we compared and analyzed the sequences of virA from wild-type virulent and avirulent strains. Results showed that functional virA appears to exist only in virulent strains and has been structurally mutated in avirulent strains. In conclusion, virA gene is a novel identified virulence-relate gene. It may play a key role in the evolution and pathogenicity of S. suis serotype 2.
TI  - Streptococcus suis outbreak investigation using multiple-locus variable tandem repeat number analysis.
AB  - Two outbreaks of Streptococcus suis ST7 occurred in humans in 1998 and 2005 in China. PFGE of chromosome restriction fragments found all ST7 isolates to be indistinguishable. Due to the genetic homogeneity of ST7 isolates, development of a rapid sub-typing method with high discriminatory power for ST7 isolates is required. In this study, a novel method, MLVA, was developed to type S. suis serotype 2 strains. Further, this method was used to analyze outbreak-associated ST7 strains in China. A total of 144 ST7 S. suis isolates were sub-typed into 34 MLVA types. Among these, eight isolates from the 1998 outbreak were sub-typed into five MLVA types, of which four MLVA types were also detected in Sichuan in 2005. These data indicate that the pathogens responsible for the two outbreaks had the same origin. In addition, some observations also provided molecular evidence for the transmission route, possibly indicating that the MLVA method has usefulness in epidemiology. The developed MLVA scheme for S. suis has greater discriminative power than PFGE. The method described here may be useful for identifying the source of S. suis infection and monitoring its spread.
TI  - The occurrence of Bordetella bronchiseptica in pigs with clinical respiratory disease.
AB  - Between January 2003 and September 2008, 652 Bordetella bronchiseptica isolates were cultured from 3506 lung samples collected from pigs with respiratory disease. Over the 6-year period, the average isolation rate was 18.6%, making B. bronchiseptica the fourth most frequently isolated pathogenic bacterium from those lung samples. The isolation rates in different years and provinces ranged from 15.2% to 25.7% and 17.3% to 20.7%, respectively. There were significant influences of sampling month and pig age on bacterial isolation (P<0.05). Streptococcus suis (29.9%), Haemophilus parasuis (26.7%) and Escherichia coli (21.6%) were isolated most frequently in association with B. bronchiseptica. All 12 toxigenic Pasteurella multocida strains co-isolated with B. bronchiseptica from 63 cases of atrophic rhinitis were classified into serogroup D. The results suggest that B. bronchiseptica infection is highly prevalent in pig farms in China, and is often accompanied by co-infection with other bacteria.
TI  - Causes and time-course of vertigo in an ear, nose, and throat clinic.
AB  - The purpose of this study is to review etiologies and identify the time-course of vertigo presenting in an ear, nose, and throat clinic, and serve as a reference guide for other clinics. The study includes retrospective chart review in a tertiary care, university hospital. The patient data with reported ICD-10 codes as causes of vertigo between April 2005 and December 2007 were extracted from the database. At each visit, the main diagnosis as to etiology, characteristics of the vertigo, its time-course, and patient demographic data were recorded. Of 547 cases, 17 diagnoses were made in 73.9%. Diagnostic categories included peripheral vertigo 72.9%, central vertigo 0.8%, psychogenic cause 0.2%, and unknown 26.1%. Common causes of vertigo were benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) 52.5%, Meniere's disease 14.6%, and sudden idiopathic hearing loss 2.9%. Less common diagnoses were benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood 0.7%, labyrinthitis 0.7%, and vestibular schwannoma 0.3%. Rare conditions were delayed endolymphatic hydrops, Ramsey Hunt syndrome, otosyphilis, vestibular neuritis, temporal bone fracture, post-concussion syndrome, cerebellar infarction, epilepsy, cervical vertigo, Streptococcus suis meningitis, and psychogenic vertigo. Ninety-nine cases who reported remission of vertigo during the study period had median onset of the remission at 4 weeks. In the ear, nose, and throat clinic at Chiang Mai University, a tertiary university hospital, peripheral vestibular disorders were the main etiology of vertigo. The three most common causes were BPPV, Meniere's disease, and sudden idiopathic hearing loss. Half of the cases who returned for follow up had remitted symptoms within 4 weeks.
TI  - Structure determination of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 capsular polysaccharide.
AB  - The capsular polysaccharide (CPS) of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 was isolated,  purified, chemically modified, and characterized. Sugar and absolute configuration analyses of the CPS gave the following composition: D-Gal, 3; D-Glc, 1; D-GlcNAc, 1; D-Neu5Ac, 1; L-Rha, 1. Sialic acid was found to be terminal, and the CPS was quantitatively desialylated by mild acid hydrolysis. The CPS was also submitted to periodate oxidation followed by borohydride reduction and Smith degradation. Sugar and methylation analysis, 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectrometry of the native CPS or of its specifically modified products allowed to determine the repeating unit sequence: [4)[Neu5Ac(alpha2-6)Gal(beta1-4)GlcNAc(beta1-3)]Gal(beta1-4)[Gal(alpha1-3)]Rha(be ta1-4)Glc(beta1-]n. The backbone sequence was found to be identical to that of Streptococcus agalactiae or group B Streptococcus (GBS) type VIII and Streptococcus pneumoniae type 23F. The S. suis CPS shares the sequence Neu5Ac-Gal-GlcNAc-Gal in common with GBS types Ia, Ib, II, III, and IV CPSs but differs from them by the presence of rhamnose and the fact that sialic acid is 2,6- rather than 2,3-linked to the following Gal. A correlation between the S. suis CPS sequence and genes of the serotype 2 cps locus encoding putative enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of the repeating unit was tentatively established.
TI  - Identification of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 genes preferentially expressed in the natural host.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is an important zoonotic pathogen for swine and humans. Previous research about the mechanism of SS2 infection was largely established on in vitro or ex vivo models. In this study, we focused on the identification of SS2 genes preferentially expressed in vivo during natural infection in pigs. Eighty SS2 genes were identified to be up-regulated in the porcine brains and lungs by selective capture of transcribed sequences (SCOTS) and comparative dot blot analysis, followed by quantitative RT-PCR validation. These genes could be classified into 5 functional categories: metabolism, cell wall associated proteins, transporters, cell replication, and function unknown. Some of these genes may contribute to the survival and pathogenesis of SS2 in the host via the following strategies. First, SS2 evades the host innate immune clearance through modifying its metabolism and cell wall composition as indicated by the up-regulation of the corresponding gene ldh and pbp2A, respectively. Secondly, SS2 adapts to the in vivo conditions by inducing the expression of the two-component signal transduction system VicKR which may function on the target genes such as pcsB involved in stress response and cell wall biosynthesis. Thirdly, SS2 enhances its virulence in vivo by up-regulating the virulence genes, such as sly, pdgA, ssp, gidA, gcp and hp1311. Further study of these in vivo up-regulated genes will contribute to understanding the in vivo survival mechanism and pathogenesis of SS2.
TI  - Synthesis of galabiose-chitosan conjugate as potent inhibitor of Streptococcus suis adhesion.
AB  - The aim of this work is to construct a safe and effective drug candidate against  Streptococcus suis infection. A panel of chitosan-based polymer conjugates with branched galabiose (Galalpha1-4Gal) side chains was synthesized as inhibitors of S. suis adhesion. The synthesis was achieved by using an aldehyde-functionalized galabiose derivative to graft it onto chitosan amino groups. Structural compositions of the conjugates were verified by 1H NMR spectroscopy and CHN elemental analyses. Potent inhibitory activities of the conjugates against S. suis adhesion to human erythrocytes were determined at low nanomolar concentration by HAI assay. An SPR study revealed a high affinity binding (Kd=39.6 nM) of the conjugate with BSI-B4 lectin. By using biocompatible chitosan as the scaffold for presenting S. suis -specific galabiose units, as well as the concise route tailored for the conjugate syntheses, the present study provides a practical way for explorations of new anti- S. suis therapies.
TI  - Stimulating the development of national Streptococcus suis guidelines in Viet Nam through a strategic research partnership.
AB  - PROBLEM: Streptococcus suis is a common cause of adult bacterial meningitis in Viet Nam, and possibly other parts of Asia, yet this disabling infection has been largely neglected. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment are relatively straightforward and affordable but, in early 2007, no national diagnostic, case management or prevention guidelines existed in Viet Nam. APPROACH: Enhanced detection of S. suis infections was established in 2007 as part of a collaborative research programme between the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases, a key national hospital with very close links to the Ministry of Health, and a research group affiliated with Oxford University based in Viet Nam. The results were reported directly to policy-makers at the Ministry of Health. LOCAL SETTING: Viet Nam is a low-income country with a health-care system that has seen considerable improvements and increased autonomy. However, parts of the system remain fairly centralized the Ministry of Health. RELEVANT CHANGES: Following the improved detection and reporting of S. suis cases, the Ministry of Health issued guidance to all hospitals in Viet Nam on the clinical and laboratory diagnosis, treatment and prevention of S. suis. A public health laboratory diagnostic service was established at the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology and training courses were conducted for clinicians and microbiologists. Ministry of Health guidance on surveillance and control of communicable diseases was updated to include a section on S. suis. LESSONS LEARNT: Research collaborations can efficiently inform and influence national responses if they are well positioned to reach policy-makers.
TI  - Pathogenesis and antigenic characterization of a new East European subtype 3 porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus isolate.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is divided into a European and North American genotype. East European PRRSV isolates have been found to be of the European genotype, but form different subtypes. In the present study, PRRSV was isolated from a Belarusian farm with reproductive and respiratory failure and designated "Lena". Analyses revealed that Lena is a new East European subtype 3 PRRSV isolate. The main purpose of this investigation was to study the pathogenesis and antigenic characteristics of PRRSV (Lena). RESULTS: Obvious clinical and virological differences were observed between the animals inoculated with a recent European subtype 1 PRRSV isolate (Belgium A) and animals inoculated with PRRSV (Lena). Three out of six pigs inoculated with PRRSV (Belgium A) had anorexia and low fever at 3, 4 and 5 days post-inoculation (dpi). High fever, anorexia and depression were prominent signs in most pigs inoculated with PRRSV (Lena) between 2 and 28 dpi. Four pigs out of ten died during the experiment. Arcanobacterium pyogenes was isolated from lungs of one animal that died, and Streptococcus suis was isolated from lungs of one animal that was euthanized. The difference in viral titres in sera from PRRSV (Belgium A) and PRRSV (Lena)-infected pigs was statistically significant (p < 0.05) at 7, 10, 14 and 21 dpi. The highest viral titres in sera ranged from 10(4.8) to 10(6.1) TCID50/ml for PRRSV (Lena) whereas they ranged from 10(3.1) to 10(4.8) TCID50/ml for PRRSV (Belgium A).The replication of PRRSV (Lena) was further studied in depth. Viral titres ranged from 10(2.5) TCID50/100 mg to 10(5.6) TCID50/100 mg in nasal secretions between 3 and 14 dpi and from 10(2.8) TCID50/100 mg to 10(4.6) TCID50/100 mg in tonsillar scrapings between 3 and 21 dpi. High viral titres were detected in lungs (10(2.3)-10(7.7) TCID50/g tissue), tonsils (10(2.0)-10(6.2) TCID50/g tissue) and inguinal lymph nodes (10(2.2)-10(6.6) TCID50/g tissue) until 35, 28 and 35 dpi, respectively.To examine the antigenic heterogeneity between the East European subtype 3 isolate Lena, the European subtype 1 strain Lelystad and the North American strain US5, sets of monospecific polyclonal antisera were tested in immunoperoxidase monolayer assays (IPMAs) with homologous and heterologous viral antigens. Heterologous antibody titres were significantly lower than homologous titres (p = 0.01-0.03) for antisera against PRRSV (Lena) at all sampling time points. For antisera against PRRSV (Lelystad) and PRRSV (US5), heterologous antibody titres were significantly lower than homologous titres at 14 and 21 dpi (p = 0.01-0.03) and at 10 and 14 dpi (p = 0.04), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Lena is a highly pathogenic East European subtype 3 PRRSV, which differs from European subtype 1 Lelystad and North American US5 strains at both the genetic and antigenic level.
TI  - ApuA, a multifunctional alpha-glucan-degrading enzyme of Streptococcus suis, mediates adhesion to porcine epithelium and mucus.
AB  - We have identified apuA in Streptococcus suis, which encodes a bifunctional amylopullulanase with conserved alpha-amylase and pullulanase substrate-binding domains and catalytic motifs. ApuA exhibited properties typical of a Gram-positive surface protein, with a putative signal sequence and LPKTGE cell-wall-anchoring motif. A recombinant protein containing the predicted N-terminal alpha-amylase domain of ApuA was shown to have alpha-(1,4) glycosidic activity. Additionally, an apuA mutant of S. suis lacked the pullulanase alpha-(1,6) glycosidic activity detected in a cell-surface protein extract of wild-type S. suis. ApuA was required for normal growth in complex medium containing pullulan as the major carbon source, suggesting that this enzyme plays a role in nutrient acquisition in vivo via the degradation of glycogen and food-derived starch in the nasopharyngeal and oral cavities. ApuA was shown to promote adhesion to porcine epithelium and mucus in vitro, highlighting a link between carbohydrate utilization and the ability of S. suis to colonize and infect the host.
TI  - [Prokaryotic expression and immunization of glutamyl tRNA synthetase of Streptococcus suis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Glutamyl tRNA Synthetase (Gts) is a protease which catalyzes esterification between tRNA and glutamine. The immunogenicity of Gts was evaluated through immunization and challenge experiment. METHODS AND RESULTS: We cloned gts from the genome of SC19, and inserted it into prokaryotic expression plasmid pET28a-gts. The recombinant vector was transformed into E. coli BL21. Induced by IPTG, one 58 kD protein, was expressed and purified by using Ni - NTA column (Novagen). The purity of rGtS was 93.3% and the concentration of purified protein was 433 microg/mL. We proved the immunogenicity of recombinant protein rGtS by western blot analysis. We immunized Balb/c mice with rGtS and Freund's adjuvant, and after two boost vaccinations, all mice were challenged with 4 times LD50 amount of SC19 (1.2 x 10(9) CFU). The survive rate of vaccination group is 50% (4/8), significantly higher than blank vector control group (1/8). CONCLUSION: These results proved that GtS has certain immunogenicity and can offer partial protection against high dose challenge. Therefore Gts could be a potential candidate of subunit vaccine against Streptococcus suis.
TI  - The changing faces of Streptococcus antigen I/II polypeptide family adhesins.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans antigen I/II (AgI/II) protein was one of the first cell wall-anchored adhesins identified in Gram-positive bacteria. It mediates attachment of S. mutans to tooth surfaces and has been a focus for immunization studies against dental caries. The AgI/II family polypeptides recognize salivary glycoproteins, and are also involved in biofilm formation, platelet aggregation, tissue invasion and immune modulation. The genes encoding AgI/II family polypeptides are found among Streptococcus species indigenous to the human mouth, as well as in Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae and S. suis. Evidence of functionalities for different regions of the AgI/II proteins has emerged. A sequence motif within the C-terminal portion of Streptococcus gordonii SspB (AgI/II) is bound by Porphyromonas gingivalis, thus promoting oral colonization by this anaerobic pathogen. The significance of other epitopes is now clearer following resolution of regional crystal structures. A new picture emerges of the central V (variable) region, predicted to contain a carbohydrate-binding trench, being projected from the cell surface by a stalk formed by an unusual association between an N-terminal alpha-helix and a C-terminal polyproline helix. This presentation mode might be important in determining functional conformations of other Gram-positive surface proteins that have adhesin domains flanked by alpha-helical and proline-rich regions.
TI  - [Detection of bacterial meningitis by multiplex polymerase chain reaction].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a rapid method for detecting 8 pathogens which were highly  related to bacterial meningitis by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. METHOD: By optimizing the reaction condition and amplification program of single pair polymerase chain reaction, the multiplex pairs polymerase chain reactions (M-PCR) was developed to identify eight pathogens simultaneously including Neisseria Meningitis, Haemophilus Influenzae, Streptococcus Pneumoniae, Cryptococcus Neoformans, Staphylococcus Aureus, Listerisa Monocytogene, Streptococcus Suis and Mycobacterium Tuberculosis. Meanwhile, The sensitivity of M-PCR assay was also studied. RESULTS: M-PCR methods for detecting 8 pathogens which could cause bacterial meningitis have been established. M-PCR showed specific, sensitive and more rapid than conventional culturing method. CONCLUSION: This multiplex polymerase chain reaction method can be used for diagnosis and scanning of suspicious bacterial meningitis cases in order to improve the diagnostic positive rate of bacterial meningitis cases.
TI  - Detection of pathogenic Streptococcus suis bacteria using magnetic glycoparticles.
AB  - Detection of the zoonotic bacterial pathogen Streptococcus suis was achieved using magnetic glycoparticles. The bacteria contain an adhesion protein for the carbohydrate sequence Galalpha1,4Gal. After incubation with various amounts of the pathogen, magnetic concentration and ATP detection, bacterial levels down to 10(5) cfu could be detected. Submicrometer particles were needed, since with the larger microparticles the method did not succeed.
TI  - The alpha-enolase of Streptococcus suis: a previously well-known and well-characterized protein.

TI  - Identification and characterization of Streptococcus agalactiae isolates using 16S rRNA sequencing and cellular fatty acid composition analysis.
AB  - This study was undertaken to apply 16S rRNA sequence and Cellular Fatty Acid (CFA) composition analysis techniques for the identification and characterization of seven individual bacteria isolates obtained from seven infected fish samples. All samples were cultured on brain heart infusion agar. All the seven isolates were Gram positive and were identified as Streptococcus sp. The 16S rRNA sequencing method yielded about 1500 bps for each strain where upon the sequence was compared to nucleotide data in Gene Bank using BLASTN 2.2.1 sequence alignment from NCBI for the nucleotide comparison. The 16S rRNA gene sequence for all the seven samples had no sequence variation between the isolates and gave a 100% similarity to plus, plus strand with Streptococcus agalactiae strain A909 Accession number NC_007432.1 and S. agalactiae strain H36B (Accession number AAJS01000007). Also the 16S rRNA sequence showed a high (92-93%) similarity between S. agalactiae and S. equi, S. suis and S. uberis. All strains appeared to be nearly identical to each other after CFA analysis using Library Generation System (LGS) software (MIDI) and were consistent to that of S. agalactiae ATCC 12386, the CFA analysis not only confirmed the results of 16S rRNA sequence but also indicated a possibility of single source of infection. Despite their accuracy to identify the poorly described, rarely isolated, or phenotypically aberrant strains, 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and CFA analysis lacks widespread use beyond the large and reference laboratories because of technical and cost considerations.
TI  - Evaluation of the protective efficacy of a newly identified immunogenic protein,  HP0272, of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) infection is a major cause of sudden death in pigs and is of concern for humans as it has strong zoonotic capabilities. Developing novel effective vaccines would be beneficial to control SS2 infection. HP0272 is a novel immunogenic surface protein; its protective efficacy remains to be evaluated. The present mouse model found that the purified recombinant HP0272 could elicit a significant humoral antibody response, and to confer complete protection against a lethal dose of SS2 infection. In addition, real-time PCR confirmed that in vivo-induced antigen existed in most SS2 field pathogenic strains, and in half of all reference strains of different serotypes of S. suis. The results indicate that HP0272 has the potential as an effective component of a new vaccine.
TI  - Identification of a novel virulence-related gene in Streptococcus suis type 2 strains.
AB  - The trag is a novel infection-related factor identified using in vivo-induced antigen technology (IVIAT) from SS2 expression libraries with swine convalescent sera. PCR-based studies of various S. suis strains collected from different sources revealed that the trag gene was present in all the virulent SS2 strains, but absent in the avirulent T15 strain. PCR and Southern hybridization analyses of a trag-knockout strain created through homologous recombination confirmed the coding sequence of trag replaced by spc (R) cassette in the trag mutant. Zebrafish was used to identify the role of trag in SS2 virulence. The reduction of virulence in the trag mutant compared to the wild-type in animal model systems, laid the foundation for further studies.
TI  - Deafness due to haemorrhagic labyrinthitis and a review of relapses in Streptococcus suis meningitis.
AB  - Deafness is a common and often permanent neurological sequel of Streptococcus (S.) suis meningitis. Suppurative labyrinthitis, rather than direct auditory nerve infection, has been found to be the site responsible for deafness. Neuroimaging is important to localise the site involved in hearing loss and to assess the feasibility of a cochlear implantation. S. suis is very sensitive to penicillin. Although a relapse of S. suis meningitis is uncommon, it can occur despite an adequate duration of appropriate antibiotic therapy. We describe a patient with S. suis meningitis, who developed permanent deafness from haemorrhagic labyrinthitis, as shown on magnetic resonance imaging. She suffered a relapse despite a seven-week course of intravenous antibiotics. A review on six cases of relapse reported in the literature shows that relapses occurred despite two to four weeks of antibiotics being administered to the patients. The clinical implications and treatment of relapse are discussed.
TI  - Pleiotropic effects of polysaccharide capsule loss on selected biological properties of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - In this study, an unencapsulated Streptococcus suis mutant was used to investigate the pleiotropic effects resulting from capsule loss. The capsule deficient mutant of S. suis acquired a biofilm-positive phenotype, which was associated with significantly increased cell surface hydrophobicity. Cell-associated fibrinogen-binding and chymotrypsin-like activities were decreased in the unencapsulated mutant. The mutant did not differ significantly from the encapsulated parent strain for minimal inhibitory concentrations to penicillin G, ampicillin, and tetracycline. However, while the encapsulated strain was highly resistant to the bactericidal action of penicillin G and ampicillin, the unencapsulated mutant was approximately 60-fold more sensitive. Compared with the parent strain, the unencapsulated mutant induced a much higher inflammatory response in monocyte-derived macrophages resulting in an increased secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and IL-8. The capsule appears to hinder important adhesins or hydrophobic molecules that mediate biofilm formation, as well as cell wall components capable of stimulating immune cells.
TI  - Identification of a novel angiogenin inhibitor 1 and its association with hyaluronidase of Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - To characterize the role of hyaluronidase (Hyl) of Streptococcus suis serotype 2  (S. suis 2), the hylA gene that encodes Hyl was cloned, expressed and purified. A murine brain cDNA library was used to screen for interacting proteins of Hyl. Employing the yeast two-hybrid system, a novel murine ribonuclease, angiogenin inhibitor 1 (AI1), which shares 93% homology with porcine AI1, was shown to interact with Hyl in yeast. Through co-immunoprecipitation assays, the interaction between AI1 and Hyl was further confirmed. Transcription and translation products of the identified cDNA were detected in both normal cells and S. suis 2-infected cells. AI1 was found to localize mainly in the cytoplasm of 293T cells. These results suggested that the identified protein AI1 might be involved in the pathogenesis of meningitis through interaction with Hyl of S. suis 2.

TI  - Quantification of the severity of an outbreak in human infection control.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The severity of an outbreak is a priority in decision-making for human infection control. However, there have been no reports on how to quantify the severity of an outbreak. METHODS: We propose a simple method to measure the severity of an infectious disease outbreak. It involves scoring the severity of clinical signs, the transmission of the infection, the number of cases, and the infection source. RESULTS: The method was evaluated using the data available at the early stage of some recent outbreaks of infectious diseases, including the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in 2009, and the evaluation supports the design idea. CONCLUSION: The method is practical for rating the severity of an infectious disease outbreak, though it should be optimized. It could also be used to judge whether an event constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) or not.
TI  - Streptococcus suis: a new emerging or an old neglected zoonotic pathogen?
AB  - Infections caused by Streptococcus suis are considered a global and an economical problem in the swine industry. Moreover, S. suis is an agent of zoonosis that afflicts people in close contact with infected pigs or pork-derived products. Although sporadic cases of S. suis infections in humans (mainly meningitis) have been reported during the last 40 years, a large outbreak due to this pathogen emerged in the summer of 2005 in China. The severity of the infection in humans during the outbreak, such as a shorter incubation time, more rapid disease progression and higher rate of mortality, attracted a lot of attention from the scientific community and the general press. In fact, the number of publications on S. suis (including the number of reported human cases) has significantly increased during recent years. In this article we critically review the present knowledge on S. suis infection in humans, we discuss the hypotheses that may explain the 2005 outbreak and the repercussion of such an episode on the scientific community.
TI  - Transcriptome profiling of zebrafish infected with Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important pathogen in swine, and it also represents an emerging zoonotic agent. Zebrafish as a model for the evaluation of virulence of S. suis has been demonstrated before. Here, an Affymetrix Zebrafish GeneChip was used to identify alterations in gene expression of zebrafish injected with S. suis serotype 2 strain HA9801. The results showed that 189 genes were differentially expressed, of which 125 genes were upregulated and 64 genes were downregulated. Gene Ontology category and KEGG pathway were analyzed for differentially expressed genes. Upregulated genes were involved in response to bacterium, immune response, inflammatory response, complement activation, defense response. Three genes (encoding serum amyloid protein A, matrix metalloproteinase 9 and apoptosis-related cysteine protease) and genes involved in the regulation of IL-6 biosynthetic process, which have previously been implicated in the response to S. suis infection in other organisms, were also upregulated. Downregulated genes played roles in glycolysis, carbohydrate metabolic process, amino acids metabolism, behavior and muscle. The reliability of the data obtained from the microarray was verified by performing quantitative real-time PCR on 12 representative genes. The data may provide further validation of this model, which will contribute to understanding of S. suis pathogenic mechanisms.
TI  - Occurrence of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae infections in suckling and nursery pigs in a region of high pig density.
AB  - The occurrence of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae infections in young pigs was surveyed  in a retrospective study of 1122 datasets obtained from routine diagnostics where either suckling or nursery pigs were examined for M hyopneumoniae in lung tissue. Findings were correlated with the presence of lung lesions, detection of other respiratory pathogens, vaccination history and parameters describing the herd of origin. The prevalence of M hyopneumoniae in lung tissue from 201 suckling pigs was 2.0 per cent and, therefore, significantly lower than in lung tissue from 921 nursery pigs, which was 9.3 per cent. Previous use of antimicrobials and the vital status of the pigs when delivered for postmortem examination did not influence the detection of M hyopneumoniae infection. The presence of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV)-EU genotype, Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus parasuis, Mycoplasma hyorhinis or Streptococcus suis was correlated with a higher probability of also finding M hyopneumoniae. The history of vaccination, the time of the first or second application, and the type of vaccine (one- versus two-shot) did not influence the detection of M hyopneumoniae. A correlation between the type of herd and the presence of M hyopneumoniae was statistically insignificant and no effect of farrowing rhythm could be confirmed.
TI  - The cell envelope subtilisin-like proteinase is a virulence determinant for Streptococcus suis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus suis is a major swine pathogen and zoonotic agent that  mainly causes septicemia, meningitis, and endocarditis. It has recently been suggested that proteinases produced by S. suis (serotype 2) are potential virulence determinants. In the present study, we screened a S. suis mutant library created by the insertion of Tn917 transposon in order to isolate a mutant deficient in a cell surface proteinase. We characterized the gene and assessed the proteinase for its potential as a virulence factor. RESULTS: Two mutants (G6G and M3G) possessing a single Tn917 insertion were isolated. The affected gene coded for a protein (SSU0757) that shared a high degree of identity with Streptococccus thermophilus PrtS (95.9%) and, to a lesser extent, with Streptococcus agalactiae CspA (49.5%), which are cell surface serine proteinases. The SSU0757 protein had a calculated molecular mass of 169.6 kDa and contained the catalytic triad characteristic of subtilisin family proteinases: motif I (Asp200), motif II (His239), and motif III (Ser568). SSU0757 also had the Gram-positive cell wall anchoring motif (Leu-Pro-X-Thr-Gly) at the carboxy-terminus, which was followed by a hydrophobic domain. All the S. suis isolates tested, which belonged to different serotypes, possessed the gene encoding the SSU0757 protein. The two mutants devoid of subtilisin-like proteinase activity had longer generation times and were more susceptible to killing by whole blood than the wild-type parent strain P1/7. The virulence of the G6G and M3G mutants was compared to the wild-type strain in the CD1 mouse model. Significant differences in mortality rates were noted between the P1/7 group and the M3G and G6G groups (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In summary, we identified a gene coding for a cell surface subtilisin-like serine proteinase that is widely distributed in S. suis. Evidences were brought for the involvement of this proteinase in S. suis virulence.
TI  - The cation-uptake regulators AdcR and Fur are necessary for full virulence of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - In streptococci, the pleiotropic regulators AdcR and Fur control the transport of, zinc and iron, respectively, which are essential components of many proteins. In this work, DeltaadcR, Deltafur, and DeltaadcR Deltafur mutants of Streptococcus suis, a serious pathogen in pigs and humans, were assayed in a mouse model to determine their involvement in the virulence of this bacterium. The results showed, for the first time, that the virulence of S. suis mutants carrying an inactivation of adcR, fur, or both genes is significantly attenuated compared to the wild-type parent strain. Furthermore, all mutants were found to be more sensitive to oxidative stress. Our data provide evidence that the adcR and fur genes play important roles in the oxidative stress response of S. suis as well as in the full virulence of this bacterium.
TI  - Immunoprotective activities of a Streptococcus suis pilus subunit in murine models of infection.
AB  - Pili of gram-positive bacteria are key virulence factors and their subunits are considered excellent vaccine candidates. Streptococcus suis is an emerging zoonotic agent that can cause epidemics of life-threatening infections in humans, but the functional role or immunoprotective potential of its pilus components have not been studied yet. Using a selective proteomics approach, we have identified a surface protein of serotype 2 S. suis showing features of an ancillary pilus subunit, as evidenced by bioinformatics analysis, immunoblot and immunoelectron microscopy. Immunization with recombinant fragments of this protein, designated herein as PAPI-2b, markedly protected mice from systemic S. suis infection.
TI  - Uncovering newly emerging variants of Streptococcus suis, an important zoonotic agent.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is recognized as a major swine pathogen and an emerging zoonotic agent. Two large-scale outbreaks of severe S. suis epidemics occurred in China in 1998 and 2005 that posed serious concerns to public health and challenged the conventional conception that opportunistic infections of S. suis serotype 2 (SS2) in humans were only sporadic cases. An extensive, collaborative study on Chinese SS2 variants, which exhibit strong invasiveness and high pathogenicity, has resulted in the description of a new disease form of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) and a putative pathogenicity island (termed 89K). The abbreviation of STSS is used for the severe disease caused by both Staphylococci and Streptococci. The main virulence factors involved in STSS caused by either Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes consist of so-called superantigens or molecules that trigger a nonspecific, uncontrolled activation of T cells and massive cytokine release. However, although a collection of new virulence factors have been described, no superantigen candidates have been found for SS2 strains, implying that a different mechanism could be involved in the STSS form caused by SS2 variants.
TI  - Mutations in the gene encoding the ancillary pilin subunit of the Streptococcus suis srtF cluster result in pili formed by the major subunit only.
AB  - Pili have been shown to contribute to the virulence of different Gram-positive pathogenic species. Among other critical steps of bacterial pathogenesis, these structures participate in adherence to host cells, colonization and systemic virulence. Recently, the presence of at least four discrete gene clusters encoding putative pili has been revealed in the major swine pathogen and emerging zoonotic agent Streptococcus suis. However, pili production by this species has not yet been demonstrated. In this study, we investigated the functionality of one of these pili clusters, known as the srtF pilus cluster, by the construction of mutant strains for each of the four genes of the cluster as well as by the generation of antibodies against the putative pilin subunits. Results revealed that the S. suis serotype 2 strain P1/7, as well as several other highly virulent invasive S. suis serotype 2 isolates express pili from this cluster. However, in most cases tested, and as a result of nonsense mutations at the 5' end of the gene encoding the minor pilin subunit (a putative adhesin), pili were formed by the major pilin subunit only. We then evaluated the role these pili play in S. suis virulence. Abolishment of the expression of srtF cluster-encoded pili did not result in impaired interactions of S. suis with porcine brain microvascular endothelial cells. Furthermore, non-piliated mutants were as virulent as the wild type strain when evaluated in a murine model of S. suis sepsis. Our results show that srtF cluster-encoded, S. suis pili are atypical compared to other Gram-positive pili. In addition, since the highly virulent strains under investigation are unlikely to produce other pili, our results suggest that pili might be dispensable for critical steps of the S. suis pathogenesis of infection.
TI  - Differential activation of the Toll-like receptor 2/6 complex by lipoproteins of  Streptococcus suis serotypes 2 and 9.
AB  - Streptococcus suis causes invasive infections in pigs and occasionally in humans. Worldwide, S. suis serotype 2 is most frequently isolated from diseased piglets, but the less virulent serotype 9 is emerging, at least in Europe. We compared the activation of human Toll-like receptors (hTLRs) by S. suis serotype 2 and 9 strains to better understand the role of the innate immune response in fighting S. suis infections. Neither live nor heat-killed log phase grown S. suis activated the hTLR1/2, hTLR2/6 and hTLR4/MD-2 complexes. However, the hTLR2/6 complex was specifically activated by both serotypes after disruption of the cell wall synthesis using penicillin. Activation levels of the hTLR2/6 complex were higher for serotype 9 strains compared to serotype 2 strains suggesting intrinsic differences in cell wall composition between both serotypes. The hTLR2/6 activating fractions decreased in molecular size after digestion with proteinase K and were sensitive for lipoprotein lipase digestion and NaOH hydrolysis, indicating lipoprotein(s) as active component(s). Overall, our results indicate that S. suis lipoproteins activate TLR2/6 but not TLR1/2 and that the clinically different serotypes 2 and 9 display differential release of TLR ligand when cell wall integrity is compromised.

TI  - Identification of a cell wall-associated subtilisin-like serine protease involved in the pathogenesis of Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important swine and human pathogen, and also an emerging zoonotic agent. A surface-associated subtilisin-like serine protease (SspA) of S. suis was identified by screening a genomic expression library as fragments of this protein reacted most strongly with convalescent-phase pig sera. The sspA gene is present in 29 of 33 S. suis serotypes reference strains and is expressed on the surface of S. suis. Relative real-time quantitative PCR assay demonstrated that sspA mRNA expression in vivo was several thousand fold of that in vitro. A sspA(-) mutant was generated from a S. suis serotype 2 strain SC19 by allelic exchange. The mutant was not different from the wild type strain in subcellular structures and in hemolytic phenotype. However, the virulence of the sspA(-) mutant was markedly lower than the wild type in pigs as demonstrated in experimental infections. These data indicated that the surface-associated protein SspA is a conserved virulence factor of S. suis and is involved in the pathogenesis of S. suis.
TI  - Emergence of a cell wall protease in the Streptococcus thermophilus population.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus is perceived as a recently emerged food bacterium that evolved from a commensal ancestor by loss and gain of functions. Here, we provide data allowing a better understanding of this evolutionary scheme. A multilocus sequence typing approach that we developed showed that S. thermophilus diverges significantly from its potential ancestors of the salivarius group and displays a low level of allelic variability, confirming its likely recent emergence. An analysis of the origin and dissemination of the prtS gene was carried out within this evolutionary scheme. This gene encodes a protease that allows better growth in milk by facilitating casein breakdown to supply amino acids. The S. thermophilus protease exhibits 95% identity to the animal Streptococcus suis protein PrtS. Genomic analysis showed that prtS is part of an island flanked by two tandem insertion sequence elements and containing three other genes which present the best identities and synteny with the S. suis genome. These data indicate a potential origin for this "ecological" island in a species closely related to S. suis. The analysis of the distribution of the prtS gene in S. thermophilus showed that the gene is infrequent in historical collections but frequent in recent industrial ones. Moreover, this "ecological" island conferring an important metabolic trait for milk adaptation appears to have disseminated by lateral transfer in the S. thermophilus population. Taken together, these data support an evolutionary scheme of S. thermophilus where gene acquisition and selection by food producers are determining factors. The source and impact of genes acquired by horizontal gene transfer on the physiology and safety of strains should be addressed.
TI  - Partial recN gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - Partial sequences of the recN gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. The partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. The mean DNA sequence similarity of recN gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be lower than those of the 16S rRNA gene (94.1 %), rpoB (84.6 %), sodA (74.8 %), groEL (78.1 %) and gyrB (73.2 %). Phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: Streptococcus salivarius, S. equinus, S. hyovaginalis/S. pluranimalium/S. thoraltensis, S. pyogenes, S. mutans and S. suis. The 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: Streptococcus sanguinis/S. cristatus/S. sinensis, S. anginosus/S. intermedius/S. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and S. mitis/S. infantis/S. peroris/S. oralis/S. oligofermentans/S. pneumoniae/S. pseudopneumoniae. The partial recN gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. This observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groEL, gyrB, rpoB and sodA). A high percentage of similarity was found between S. intermedius and S. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recN gene. To study the genetic diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recN, groEL, sodA, gyrB and rpoB sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. The results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.
TI  - [A case of Streptococcus suis endocarditis, probably bovine-transmitted, complicated by pulmonary embolism and spondylitis].
AB  - Streptococcus suis, a major global porcine pathogen, is an emerging zoonosis in Southeast Asia that triggered a 2005 outbreak in China. S. suis causes meningitis, sepsis, and endocarditis in both pigs and humans and involves significant mortality. We report the case of a previously healthy 50-year-old dairy farmer who developed S. suis type 2 endocarditis complicated by pulmonary embolism and spondylitis. He experienced a high fever, chills, fatigue, and worsening low back pain in the 6 weeks prior to admission. On physical examination, he had lumbar spine tenderness and weakness of the left leg. Blood culture identified penicillin-sensitive S. suis type 2. Echocardiography showed vegetation on the tricuspid valve, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed signs of spondylitis. The man reported sudden chest pain several days after admission, which computed tomography (CT) showed what was diagnosed as a septic pulmonary embolism. He was treated with penicillin G for 4 weeks and gentamicin for the first 2 weeks, followed by 2 weeks of oral amoxicillin, after which his symptoms gradually improved. The infection source was probably his dairy herd, since calves often bit his fingers while feeding and S. suis was found in their oral mucus. Over 400 cases of human S. suis infection have been reported globally, but this is, to our knowledge, the first known case of bovine transmission. All of Japan's 8 other cases involved occupational swine exposure, 5 of whom had injuries to their fingers. This emerging situation should be made known to all possibly involved in unprotected direct contact with swine and cattle, particularly when the skin could be compromised by cuts or abrasions.
TI  - Characterization of a virulence-associated and cell-wall-located DNase of Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - We investigated culture supernatant proteins from the M1 serotype of Streptococcus pyogenes by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and peptide mass mapping analysis, and characterized the single protein spots. Among them, we analysed the Spy0747 protein. This protein is homologous to the SsnA protein, a cell-wall-located DNase expressed in Streptococcus suis serotype 2. We designated the Spy0747 protein as SpnA. SpnA protein was also detected in the insoluble fraction of whole-cell lysates using shotgun proteomic analysis, suggesting that SpnA is also located in the cell wall. SpnA was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase-fusion protein in Escherichia coli. We confirmed that the recombinant protein had DNase activity that was dependent on Ca(2+) and Mg(2+), like SsnA. Blood bactericidal assays and mouse infection model experiments showed that the spnA knockout strain was less virulent than the parental strain, thus suggesting that SpnA could play an important role in virulence. Using PCR, we found that the spnA gene was present in all clinical S. pyogenes strains we examined. Our results, together with a previous report identifying Spy0747 as a surface-associated protein, suggest that SpnA is an important cell-wall-located DNase that is generally produced in S. pyogenes and is involved in virulence.
TI  - Streptococcus suis enolase functions as a protective antigen displayed on the bacterial cell surface.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) has evolved into a highly infectious entity, posing a great threat to public health. Screening for and identification of protective antigens plays an important role in developing therapies against SS2 infections. METHODS: Multiple strategies were used to investigate a new surface protein that has the potential to be a protective antigen. These strategies included molecular cloning, biochemical and biophysical analyses, enzymatic assay, immunological approaches (eg, immunoelectron microscopy), and experimental infections of animals. RESULTS: We identified an enolase gene from SS2 and systematically characterized its protein product, enolase. Biophysical data indicated that S. suis enolase is an octameric protein. Enzymatic assays verified its ability to catalyze the dehydration of 2-phospho-D-glycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate. In consideration of the strong antigenicity of enolase, an efficient enolase-based method was established for monitoring SS2 infections. Combined evidence strongly indicated that SS2 enolase can localize on the bacterial cell surface and facilitate bacterial adherence. Additionally, we found that enolase can confer complete protection against SS2 infection to mice, which suggests that enolase has potential as a vaccine candidate. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that S. suis enolase functions as a protective antigen displayed on the bacterial cell surface and that it can be used to develop new strategies to combat SS2 infections.
TI  - Streptococcus suis infection: a prospective study in northern Thailand.
AB  - A prospective study of all cases of Streptococcus suis blood or CSF culture positive admitted to Lamphun Provincial Hospital in northern Thailand was carried out. Fifty-three cases of S. suis were identified, which comprised 70% of all viridans streptococci cases. The majority of cases (88.6%) were contracted orally and 83.0% had an underlying disease present. Five clinical syndromes were identified: acute meningitis (37.2%), septicemia (27.9%), toxic shock syndrome (TSS) (23.3%), subacute bacterial endocarditis(SBE) (9.3%) and spondylitis (2.3%). The patients with TSS had a lower mean age than those without TSS. S. suis IgG and IgM antibody levels in the TSS group were lower than those without TSS which is important when considering the clinical syndrome and severity of the infection.
TI  - Genetic analysis of Streptococcus suis isolates recovered from diseased and healthy carrier pigs at different stages of production on a pig farm.
AB  - Streptococcus suis isolates from pigs at different stages of production on a farrow-to-finish farm were characterised by serotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and production of muramidase-released protein, extracellular factor and suilysin. S. suis was isolated from the tonsils of 81/287 (28.2%) healthy pigs: 16/47 (34%) post-weaning, 18/47 (38.3%) transition, 18/47 (38.3%) fattening and 29/146 (19.9%) sows. A total of 127 S. suis isolates were analysed: 14 from diseased pigs at the post-weaning stage and 113 from the tonsils of healthy pigs. Serotypes 2, 4, 9, 14 and 1/14 were isolated from both diseased and healthy pigs. A total of 83 PFGE profiles were obtained; most isolates (95.2%) were grouped into three clusters (A-C). Animals at different production stages harboured isolates with similar phenotypic and genetic profiles, highlighting the importance of healthy animals in the maintenance of strains responsible for outbreaks of clinical disease.
TI  - Mycotic abdominal aortic aneurysm due to Streptococcus suis: a case report.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus suis is a common infection of pigs. Human infection is  often related to accidental inoculation through skin injuries during occupational exposure to pigs and pork. The disease may present as meningitis, bacteremia, and less commonly endocarditis, arthritis, or bronchopneumonia. METHODS: Case report and review of the literature. RESULTS: We report a case of bacteremia and severe sepsis caused by S. suis serotype 2 complicated by septic arthritis in a 56-year-old male with history of a prior contact with unprocessed pork. The causative agent was isolated from blood cultures and aspirated synovial fluid. The patient's condition improved after treatment with penicillin, but he was found subsequently to have an abdominal aortic aneurysm, confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scan. The mycotic aneurysm was successfully repaired using an in situ graft reconstruction. Tissue samples analyzed using polymerase chain reaction identified S. suis serotype 2 as the causative organism. After completion of two weeks of parenteral antibiotics, an oral form of ciprofloxacin (0.25 g twice a day) was continued for one month. The patient was discharged from our institution after uncomplicated recovery. Clinical review, a CT scan, and inflammatory markers nine months after surgery revealed no evidence of infection. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of mycotic aneurysm caused by S. suis, which may be an etiologic agent of mycotic aneurysms, especially when complicated by bacteremia in adults with a recent history of contact with pigs or unprocessed pork.
TI  - Postantibiotic effects and postantibiotic sub-MIC effects of tilmicosin, erythromycin and tiamulin on erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus suis.
AB  - The postantibiotic effects (PAEs) and postantibiotic sub-MIC effects (PA SMEs) of tilmicosin, erythromycin and tiamulin on erythromycin-susceptible and erythromycin-resistant strains of Streptococcus suis (M phenotype) were investigated in vitro. Tilmicosin and tiamulin induced significantly longer PAE and PA SME against both erythromycin-susceptible and erythromycin-resistant strains than did erythromycin. The durations of PAE and PA SMEs were proportional to the concentrations of drugs used for exposure. The PA SMEs were substantially longer than PAEs on S. suis (P<0.05) regardless of the antimicrobial used for exposure. The results indicated that the PAE and PA SME could help in the design of efficient control strategies for infection especially caused by erythromycin-resistant S. suis and that they may provide additional valuable information for the rational drug use in clinical practice.
TI  - Contribution of the FeoB transporter to Streptococcus suis virulence.
AB  - The contribution of iron transporter systems encoded by feo genes to the pathogenic traits of streptococci is largely unknown, despite the fact that those systems are required for the full virulence of several gram-negative bacterial species. In this work, we show that the swine pathogen and zoonotic agent Streptococcus suis has a feoAB operon similar to that encoding an iron transporter system in Escherichia coli. Electrophoretic mobility assays and transcriptional analyses confirmed that the expression of S. suis feo genes is under the negative control of the ferric uptake regulator (Fur) protein. In vivo trials in mice using a feoB defective mutant strain were carried out to investigate the contribution of this gene to the virulence of S. suis. The results showed that the median lethal dose (LD50) of the mutant was approximately 10-fold higher than that of the wild-type parent strain. These data suggest that the Feo metal transporter plays a significant role in streptococcal infectious disease. This is in contrast to previous results reported for this same gene in other gram-positive bacterial species.
TI  - Genetic and virulence-phenotype characterization of serotypes 2 and 9 of Streptococcus suis swine isolates.
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the genetic characteristics and virulence phenotypes of Streptococcus suis, specifically, in clinical isolates of serotypes 2 and 9 (n = 195), obtained from diverse geographical areas across Spain. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing identified 97 genetic profiles, 68% of which were represented by single isolates, indicative of a substantial genetic diversity among the S. suis isolates analyzed. Five PFGE profiles accounted for 33.3% of the isolates and were isolated from 38% of the herds in nine different provinces, indicative of the bacterium's widespread distribution in the Spanish swine population. Representative isolates of the most prevalent PFGE profiles of both serotypes were subjected to multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis. The results indicated that serotypes 2 and 9 have distinct genetic backgrounds. Serotype 2 isolates belong to the ST1 complex, a highly successful clone that has spread over most European countries. In accordance with isolates of this complex, most serotype 2 isolates also expressed the phenotype MRP(+)EF(+)SLY(+). Serotype 9 isolates belong to the ST61 complex, which is distantly related to the widespread European ST87 clone. Also, in contrast to most isolates of the European ST87 clone, which express the large variant MRP*, the majority of serotype 9 isolates (97.9%) did not express the protein.
TI  - Use of in vivo-induced antigen technology (IVIAT) for the identification of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 in vivo-induced bacterial protein antigens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is a zoonotic agent that causes death and disease in both humans and swine. A better understanding of SS2-host molecular interactions is crucial for understanding SS2 pathogenesis and immunology. Conventional genetic and biochemical approaches used to study SS2 virulence factors are unable to take into account the complex and dynamic environmental stimuli associated with the infection process. In this study, in vivo-induced antigen technology (IVIAT), an immunoscreening technique, was used to identify the immunogenic bacterial proteins that are induced or upregulated in vivo during SS2 infection. RESULTS: Convalescent-phase sera from pigs infected with SS2 were pooled, adsorbed against in vitro antigens, and used to screen SS2 genomic expression libraries. Upon analysis of the identified proteins, we were able to assign a putative function to 40 of the 48 proteins. These included proteins implicated in cell envelope structure, regulation, molecule synthesis, substance and energy metabolism, transport, translation, and those with unknown functions. The in vivo-induced changes in the expression of 10 of these 40 genes were measured using real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, revealing that the expression of 6 of the 10 genes was upregulated in the in vivo condition. The strain distribution of these 10 genes was analyzed by PCR, and they were found in the most virulent SS2 strains. In addition, protein sequence alignments of the newly identified proteins demonstrate that three are putative virulence-associated proteins. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our results suggest that these in vivo-induced or upregulated genes may contribute to SS2 disease development. We hypothesize that the identification of factors specifically induced or upregulated during SS2 infection will aid in our understanding of SS2 pathogenesis and may contribute to the control SS2 outbreaks. In addition, the proteins identified using IVIAT may be useful potential vaccine candidates or virulence markers.
TI  - Identification and characterization of inosine 5-monophosphate dehydrogenase in Streptococcus suis type 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis type 2 is a swine pathogen responsible for diverse diseases. Although many virulent factors have been identified and studied, relatively little is known about the pathogenic mechanisms of type 2. The aim of the study was to identify and understand the characterization of Inosine 5-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH). A 957-bp gene, impdh, was identified in the virulent S. suis serotype 2 (SS2), and analysis of the predicted IMPDH sequence revealed IMP dehydrogenase/GMP reductase domain. The gene encoding for the IMPDH of S. suis was cloned and sequenced. The DNA sequence contained an open reading frame encoding for a 318 amino acid polypeptide exhibiting 23% sequence identity with the IMPDH from Streptococcus pyogenes (YP281355) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (ZP00404150). Using the pET(32) expression plasmid, the impdh gene was inducibly overexpressed in Escherichia coli to produce IMPDH with a hexahistidyl N-terminus to permit its purification. The (His)6 IMPDH protein was found to possess functional IMPDH enzymatic activity after the purification. The impdh-knockout SS2 mutant ( Delta IMPDH) constructed in this study was slower in growth and one pH unit higher than SS2-H after 6 h of culturing, and found to be attenuated in mouse models of infection for 2.5 times and not be capable of causing death in porcine models of infection in contrast with the parent SS2-H.
TI  - Development of colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic assay for rapid detection of Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - To develop colloidal gold immunochromatographic strips for the direct detection of the Streptococcus suis serotype 2 antigen, colloidal gold was prepared by reduction of a gold salt with sodium citrate and coupled with polyclonal antibody against S. suis serotype 2. The optimal concentrations of the capture antibody and the coating antibody were determined to be 22mug/mL and 2.0mg/mL, respectively, and that of the blocking buffer was determined to be 1.5% bovine serum albumin. Different serotypes of S. suis and other related bacteria were used to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and stability of the immunochromatographic strips. The detection sensitivity was found to be as high as 10(6)CFU/mL. There was no cross-reaction of the antibodies with other serotypes of S. suis (except with SS1/2, which shares some common sugar residues or antigenic determinants with serotype 2) and other related bacteria. In conclusion, we developed colloidal gold immunochromatographic strips that had high sensitivity and specificity. This method proved to be feasible, convenient, rapid, and effective for detecting S. suis serotype 2.
TI  - Genetic diversity of Streptococcus suis clinical isolates from pigs and humans in Italy (2003-2007).
AB  - Streptococcus suis, a major porcine pathogen, is emerging as a zoonotic agent capable of causing severe invasive disease in humans exposed to pigs or pork products. S. suis infection is rare in industrialised countries and usually arises as sporadic cases, with meningitis the most common clinical presentation in humans. Recent reports of two cases of meningitis in Sardinia and northeastern Italy prompted this first characterisation of Italian S. suis isolates. Fifty-nine S. suis strains, the two recent human strains and 57 swine clinical isolates collected between 2003 and 2007 from different Italian herds and regions, were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility, PCR-screened for virulence and antibiotic resistance genes, and subjected to molecular typing. Phenotypic and genotypic analysis demonstrated an overall high genetic diversity among isolates, the majority of which were resistant to macrolides (78%) and tetracyclines (90%). The erm(B), tet(O), mosaic tet(O/W/32/O), tet(W), and tet(M) genes were detected. The tet(O/W/32/O) gene, the most frequent tet gene after tet(O), had never been described in the genus Streptococcus before. In addition, a virulent cps2, erm(B) tet(O) clone, belonging to sequence type 1 (ST1) of the ST1 complex, was found to be prevalent and persistent in Italian swine herds. Finally, the two human isolates (both ST1) carrying cps2, erm(B) and tet(W) were seen to be closely related to each other.
TI  - Involvement of NF-kappaB and MAP-kinases in the transcriptional response of alveolar macrophages to Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Interaction of Streptococcus suis with primary porcine alveolar macrophages was studied using transcriptomics. Transcriptional response of macrophages to two different S. suis strains was studied: wild-type S10 that is resistant to phagocytosis, and its non-encapsulated mutant that is phagocytosed efficiently. The macrophages' transcriptional response was observed only after 60 min of incubation. Eleven genes were expressed significantly different between macrophages infected with streptococci and control mock-infected macrophages. These genes include IL-1-beta, MIP-2-alpha and TNF-alpha. When gene expression was studied as a function of time, transcriptional changes occurred in all macrophages independent of streptococci. The fold induction of induced genes however, was much stronger in macrophages incubated with the non-encapsulated S. suis strain that was phagocytosed. The genes that were higher induced due to S. suis suggest an innate immune response is induced in macrophages. Pathway analysis revealed that genes that are part of the putative MAP-kinase signal transduction system are over-represented among the regulated genes. Using an immortalized alveolar macrophage cell line it was shown that macrophages respond to interaction with S. suis by the translocation of NF-kappaB to the nucleus, independent of phagocytosis. This translocation subsequently induced expression of innate immune genes. This strongly suggests besides the MAP-kinase signaling pathway, NF-kappaB signaling is also induced upon interaction with S. suis.
TI  - Avian influenza virus, Streptococcus suis serotype 2, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus and beyond: molecular epidemiology, ecology and the situation in China.
AB  - The outbreak and spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus and the subsequent identification of its animal origin study have heightened the world's awareness of animal-borne or zoonotic pathogens. In addition to SARS, the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (AIV), H5N1, and the lower pathogenicity H9N2 AIV have expanded their host ranges to infect human beings and other mammalian species as well as birds. Even the 'well-known' reservoir animals for influenza virus, migratory birds, became victims of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus. Not only the viruses, but bacteria can also expand their host range: a new disease, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, caused by human Streptococcus suis serotype 2 infection, has been observed in China with 52 human fatalities in two separate outbreaks (1998 and 2005, respectively). Additionally, enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection has increased worldwide with severe disease. Several outbreaks and sporadic isolations of this pathogen in China have made it an important target for disease control. A new highly pathogenic variant of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has been isolated in both China and Vietnam recently; although PRRSV is not a zoonotic human pathogen, its severe outbreaks have implications for food safety. All of these pathogens occur in Southeast Asia, including China, with severe consequences; therefore, we discuss the issues in this article by addressing the situation of the zoonotic threat in China.
TI  - [Biological profiles of recombinant Suilysin].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide insights into the role of Suilysin in the pathogenesis of Streptococcus suis by analysing the biological profiles of recombinant Suilysin (rSLY). METHODS: sly gene of S. suis strain SC22 was cloned into pET30a(+) vector and overexpressed in E. coli Rosseta, and rSLY was purified with Ni2+ affinity chromatography, anion exchange chromatography and gel filtration. The hemolytic unit of rSLY was measured with human red blood cells. The cellular toxicity of rSLY to human peripheral white blood cell and cells derived from fetal heart (HEH), liver (HEL), kidney (HEK), lung (HPL) was detected by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay. The blocking effects of water-soluble cholesterol, serum and specific antibody on the hemolytic activity of rSLY were detected. The amount of proinflammatory cytokines in the serum of mice stimulated by rSLY was measured by Luminex-100. RESULTS: The hemolytic unit of rSLY was 0.125 nmol/L, but the cellular toxicity of 1 nmol/L rSLY to human peripheral white blood cell, HEH, HEL, HEK and HPF was 20%-25%. The hemolytic activity of rSLY was blocked completely by equal molar of water-soluble cholesterol. Human serum containing 2.8 mmol/L-5.7 mmol/L of cholesterol in physical condition, could merely blocked 1 nmol/L of rSLY to lyse erythrocytes. The human serum with the addition of rabbit anti-rSLY IgG to a final concentration of 15 mg/ml decreased the hemolysis by 10 nmol/L rSLY from 77% down to 5% successfully, but hemolysis remained 60% when tested with 100 nmol/L rSLY. Although IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha didn't display any observable change, the level of interleukin -6 (IL-6) and KC were increased continually in C57BL/6 mice injected intraperitoneumly with rSLY whereas the IL-6 and KC level of mice in the control group only increased slightly and quickly decreased. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that rSLY could not only lyse cells but also induce strong inflammatory response and damage immune cells recruited to the sites of inflammation. This finding implies that serum could provide light protection against rSLY, and specific antibody show a concentration-dependent protection.
TI  - Clonal dissemination of human isolates of Streptococcus suis serotype 14 in Thailand.
AB  - Most cases of Streptococcus suis infection in humans are caused by serotype 2 strains, and only a few cases caused by other serotypes have been reported. Among 177 human isolates of S. suis in Thailand, 12 (6.8 %) were identified as being of serotype 14, and an occurrence of sporadic S. suis serotype 14 infection was noted during 2006-2008, particularly in northern Thailand. Clinical presentations of the 12 patients (median age 62.9 years) included meningitis (58.3 %), septic arthritis (25 %) and sepsis (16.7 %). These clinical features were similar to those previously reported for S. suis infections, except that there were no fatal cases. All of the 12 serotype 14 strains belonged to the multilocus sequence types (ST) 105 (n=11) and the novel ST127 (n=1). Molecular typing by PFGE revealed four different pulsotypes, including an identical pattern for nine ST105 strains and three closely related patterns for two ST105 strains and one ST127 strain. Our PFGE data suggested clonal dissemination of ST105 strains in Thailand. Because serotype 14 is becoming a more common cause of S. suis infections in humans, diagnostic tests for serotype 14 should be performed in South-East Asian countries.
TI  - Streptococcus porci sp. nov., isolated from swine sources.
AB  - Two unidentified Gram-positive, catalase-negative, coccus-shaped organisms were recovered from pigs and subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic analysis. Based on cellular morphology and biochemical criteria, the isolates were tentatively assigned to the genus Streptococcus, although the organisms did not appear to correspond to any recognized species. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence studies confirmed this identification and showed that the nearest phylogenetic relatives of the unknown cocci were Streptococcus plurextorum 1956-02(T) and Streptococcus suis NCTC 10234(T) (97.9 and 96.0 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, respectively). The new isolates were related most closely to S. suis CIP 103217(T) based on rpoB gene sequence analysis (<8 % sequence divergence). DNA-DNA pairing studies showed that one of the unidentified strains (2923-03(T)) displayed DNA relatedness values of 26.6 and 27.2 % with S. plurextorum CECT 7308(T) and S. suis NCTC 10234(T), respectively. On the basis of phenotypic and phylogenetic evidence, it is proposed that the unknown isolates from pigs be classified in the genus Streptococcus as members of Streptococcus porci sp. nov., with the type strain 2923-03(T) (=CECT 7374(T) =CCUG 55896(T)).
TI  - [Distributions of pathogenic capsular types and in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of different serotypes of Streptococcus suis isolated from clinically healthy sows from 10 provinces in China].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the distributions of major pathogenic capsular types and  in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of different serotypes of Streptococcus suis isolated from clinically healthy sows in China. METHODS: Tonsil specimens of clinically healthy sows from 10 different provinces in China were collected, a total of 421 S. suis were isolated. Capsular types of S. suis were decided using the sera agglutination reaction. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using a broth microdilution method and the differences between serotypes were decided statistically. RESULTS: The prevalent capsular types of S. suis isolated from clinically healthy sows were 9 (26.6%), 3 (23.5%) and 7 (15.7%) types, respectively. 7.4% of isolates were confirmed to be S. suis type 2. Overall, differences in antimicrobial susceptibility among serotypes of S. suis were found. By comparison, lower resistance was observed for S. suis type 2 from clinically healthy sows. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of pathogenic S. suis serotypes from clinically healthy sows again indicates S. suis is a conditional pathogenic bacterium. Differential prevention and treatment regimes should be considered according to antimicrobial susceptibility of different serotypes of S. suis.
TI  - [Prokaryotic expression of recombinant Streptococcus suis IgG binding protein and its binding activity with IgG].
AB  - Streptococcus suis (S. suis) IgG-binding protein (SPG) was present in all S. suis strains examined. It showed binding activities with IgG from various host species. Little was known about the biological role of this protein, but it was commonly believed that it acted as virulence factor. In this study, the genes encoding SPG were amplified respectively from the total DNA of the S. suis serotype 1/2, 1, 2 and 9 with PCR and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 by plasmid pET28a as vector. The recombinant proteins were first purified with affinity chromatography (Ni-NTA), and further purified by sephadexG-200 gel chromatography. The recombinant SPG proteins were identified to have binding activities with IgG of different host species, and for human and porcine IgG they showed better binding activities. But the SPG from different serotypes of S. suis showed no great differences in their binding activities with IgG from the same host species.
TI  - Identification and characterization of IgA1 protease from Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis (S. suis) is a major swine pathogen and an emerging zoonotic agent. However, the current understanding of the S. suis pathogenesis of infection remains limited. In the present study, an IgA1 protease of S. suis was identified for the first time. The protein was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified recombinant protein showed good cleaving reactivity to IgA1 and was highly immunoreactive to convalescent sera. The gene was found to exist in most pathogenic strains but scarcely in non-invasive isolates. These findings suggested that the IgA1 protease might play an important role in the pathogenesis of S. suis.
TI  - Crystal structures of Streptococcus suis mannonate dehydratase (ManD) and its complex with substrate: genetic and biochemical evidence for a catalytic mechanism.
AB  - Mannonate dehydratase (ManD) is found only in certain bacterial species, where it participates in the dissimilation of glucuronate. ManD catalyzes the dehydration of d-mannonate to yield 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate (2-KDG), the carbon and energy source for growth. Selective inactivation of ManD by drug targeting is of therapeutic interest in the treatment of human Streptococcus suis infections. Here, we report the overexpression, purification, functional characterization, and crystallographic structure of ManD from S. suis. Importantly, by Fourier transform mass spectrometry, we show that 2-KDG is formed when the chemically synthesized substrate (d-mannonate) is incubated with ManD. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry revealed the presence of Mn(2+) in the purified protein, and in the solution state catalytically active ManD exists as a homodimer of two 41-kDa subunits. The crystal structures of S. suis ManD in native form and in complex with its substrate and Mn(2+) ion have been solved at a resolution of 2.9 A. The core structure of S. suis ManD is a TIM barrel similar to that of other members of the xylose isomerase-like superfamily. Structural analyses and comparative amino acid sequence alignments provide evidence for the importance of His311 and Tyr325 in ManD activity. The results of site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the functional role(s) of these residues in the dehydration reaction and a plausible mechanism for the ManD-catalyzed reaction is proposed.
TI  - Screening of binding activity of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus suis to berries and juices.
AB  - Antiadhesion therapy is a promising approach to the fight against pathogens. Antibiotic resistance and the lack of effective vaccines have increased the search for new methods to prevent infectious diseases. Previous studies have shown the antiadhesion activity of juice from cultivated cranberries (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) against bacteria, especially E. coli. In this study, the binding of two streptococcal strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus agalactiae, to molecular size fractions (FI, FII and FIII, <10 kDa, 10-100 kDa, and >100 kDa, respectively) of berries and berry and fruit juices from 12 plant species were studied using a microtiter well assay. For Streptococcus suis a hemagglutination inhibition assay was used. In general, binding activity was detected especially to wild cranberry (Vaccinium oxycoccos L.) and to other Vaccinium species. S. pneumoniae cells bound most to cranberry juice fraction FI and S. agalactiae cells to cranberry fraction FIII. Hemagglutination induced by S. suis was most effectively inhibited by cranberry fraction FII. NMR spectra of some characteristic active and non-active fractions were also measured. They indicate that fractions FII and FIII contained proanthocyanidins and/or other phenolic compounds. The results suggest Vaccinium berries as possible sources of antiadhesives against bacterial infections.
TI  - Rapid evolution of virulence and drug resistance in the emerging zoonotic pathogen Streptococcus suis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus suis is a zoonotic pathogen that infects pigs and can occasionally cause serious infections in humans. S. suis infections occur sporadically in human Europe and North America, but a recent major outbreak has been described in China with high levels of mortality. The mechanisms of S. suis pathogenesis in humans and pigs are poorly understood. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The sequencing of whole genomes of S. suis isolates provides opportunities to investigate the genetic basis of infection. Here we describe whole genome sequences of three S. suis strains from the same lineage: one from European pigs, and two from human cases from China and Vietnam. Comparative genomic analysis was used to investigate the variability of these strains. S. suis is phylogenetically distinct from other Streptococcus species for which genome sequences are currently available. Accordingly, approximately 40% of the approximately 2 Mb genome is unique in comparison to other Streptococcus species. Finer genomic comparisons within the species showed a high level of sequence conservation; virtually all of the genome is common to the S. suis strains. The only exceptions are three approximately 90 kb regions, present in the two isolates from humans, composed of integrative conjugative elements and transposons. Carried in these regions are coding sequences associated with drug resistance. In addition, small-scale sequence variation has generated pseudogenes in putative virulence and colonization factors. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The genomic inventories of genetically related S. suis strains, isolated from distinct hosts and diseases, exhibit high levels of conservation. However, the genomes provide evidence that horizontal gene transfer has contributed to the evolution of drug resistance.
TI  - Serotype distribution and production of muramidase-released protein, extracellular factor and suilysin by field strains of Streptococcus suis isolated in the United States.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important swine pathogen and a zoonotic agent. Differences in virulence have been noted among the 33 described serotypes, serotype 2 being considered the most virulent. In this study, we aimed at assessing the serotype distribution and the production of virulence-associated markers by strains recovered from diseased pigs in the United States (U.S.). Results showed that among the 100 strains evaluated, serotype 3 (20% of the isolates) and serotype 2 (17%) were the most prevalent. We then investigated the presence in these isolates of the genes sly, epf and mrp, encoding the virulence-associated markers suilysin (SLY), extracellular factor (EF) and muramidase-released (MRP) protein, respectively. The effective production of the markers by the strains was also verified. Results showed that the presence of the gene did not always correlate with actual expression of the respective protein. In the case of MRP, this was due, in most cases, to frameshift mutations at the 5' end of the gene resulting in premature stop codons. The most prevalent phenotypes among U.S. strains were MRP(+)EF(-)SLY(-) (40%) and MRP(-)EF(-)SLY(+) (35%). Serotype distribution greatly differed from that reported in several European countries, as did the production of virulence markers, particularly for serotype 2. On the other hand, our results for the U.S. S. suis isolates are similar to those reported for Canadian strains, suggesting a common status in North America.
TI  - Identification of a surface protective antigen, HP0197 of Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is a porcine and human pathogen with adhesive and invasive properties. As traditional inactive vaccine has obvious shortcomings, to identify protective antigens would undoubtedly contribute to the development of novel vaccines. HP0197 has been identified as immunogenic protein in the previous study but its protective efficacy was not clear. In the present study, the purified recombinant HP0197 protein could elicit a significant humoral antibody response and could confer significant protection against challenge with lethal dose of SS2 in mice and pigs. In addition, the hyperimmune sera against HP0197 could efficiently kill the bacteria in the opsonized phagocytosis test and conferred significant protection against SS2 infection in the experiment of passive immunization. The present study suggests with strong evidence that the identified protective antigen would be a novel and an effective vaccine candidate for SS2.
TI  - Surface-associated and secreted factors of Streptococcus suis in epidemiology, pathogenesis and vaccine development.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an invasive porcine pathogen associated with meningitis, arthritis, bronchopneumonia and other diseases. The pathogen constitutes a major health problem in the swine industry worldwide. Furthermore, S. suis is an important zoonotic agent causing meningitis and other diseases in humans exposed to pigs or pork. Current knowledge on pathogenesis is limited, despite the enormous amount of data generated by 'omics' research. Accordingly, immunoprophylaxis (in pigs) is hampered by lack of a cross-protective vaccine against virulent strains of this diverse species. This review focuses on bacterial factors, both surface-associated and secreted ones, which are considered to contribute to S. suis interaction(s) with host factors and cells. Factors are presented with respect to (i) their identification and features, (ii) their distribution among S. suis and (iii) their significance for virulence, immune response and vaccination. This review also shows the enormous progress made in research on S. suis over the last few years, and it emphasizes the numerous challenging questions remaining to be answered in the future.
TI  - Streptococcus suis, an important cause of adult bacterial meningitis in northern  Vietnam.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus suis can cause severe systemic infection in adults exposed to infected pigs or after consumption of undercooked pig products. S. suis is often misdiagnosed, due to lack of awareness and improper testing. Here we report the first fifty cases diagnosed with S. suis infection in northern Viet Nam. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In 2007, diagnostics for S. suis were set up at a national hospital in Hanoi. That year there were 43 S. suis positive cerebrospinal fluid samples, of which S. suis could be cultured in 32 cases and 11 cases were only positive by PCR. Seven patients were blood culture positive for S. suis but CSF culture and PCR negative; making a total of 50 patients with laboratory confirmed S. suis infection in 2007. The number of S. suis cases peaked during the warmer months. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: S. suis was commonly diagnosed as a cause of bacterial meningitis in adults in northern Viet Nam. In countries where there is intense and widespread exposure of humans to pigs, S. suis can be an important human pathogen.
TI  - Recurrence of human Streptococcus suis infections in 2007: three cases of meningitis and implications that heterogeneous S. suis 2 circulates in China.
AB  - Emergence of fatal Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S. suis 2, SS2) in China, 2005, has greatly challenged the public health, raising serious concerns about its global circulation. Whole genome sequencing of the representative strains has identified a potential pathogenicity island (PAI), named 89K. Here, we reported the recurrence of human S. suis meningitis cases (two in Shenzhen City and one in Sichuan Province) in China, in 2007. Multiple lines of evidence supported that these human cases are caused by highly pathogenic SS2 isolates. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis indicated that these re-emerging SS2 isolates (07CQH01, 07SZH01 and 07SZH02) can be featured with different genotypes. Molecular dissection demonstrated that they all share 89K, the newly proposed PAI that is common to 2005 prevalent strains in China. Further mapping of 89K revealed that gene losses/deletions occur in 07CQH01 and 07SZH01, except 07SZH02. These findings suggested that heterogeneous SS2 circulates in China, with the capability of causing endemic with life-threatening danger.
TI  - Intranasal immunization with a live Streptococcus suis isogenic ofs mutant elicited suilysin-neutralization titers but failed to induce opsonizing antibodies and protection.
AB  - In Europe, Streptococcus suis serotypes 2 and 9 are very important causative agents of meningitis, arthritis and septicemia in piglets. So far, no vaccine has been described which elicits protection against both serotypes. The working hypothesis of this study was that an isogenic serotype 2 mutant attenuated in virulence but not in colonization of the respiratory tract might induce protective immunity against both serotypes. Piglets were immunized with the attenuated S. suis serotype 2 strain 10Deltaofs2/12, which is deficient in expression of the serum opacity factor OFS. Three weeks after intranasal application of 10Deltaofs2/12 piglets were challenged intravenously with two strains representing the most important S. suis pathotypes in Europe, the homologous MRP+ EF+ SLY+ serotype 2 strain and a heterologous MRP* SLY+ serotype 9 strain. Application of the live vaccine elicited significant serum IgG responses against muramidase-released protein (MRP), extracellular factor (EF) and, most prominently, suilysin. Seroconversion against suilysin was accompanied with an increase of suilysin-neutralization titers in the vaccinated group. Though mortality was lower in the vaccinated groups, significant protection was not observed, neither against the homologous nor against the heterologous challenge. This was in agreement with the finding that the vaccinated piglets had low opsonizing antibody titers insufficient to mediate elimination of the two challenge strains by porcine neutrophils. In conclusion, a single intranasal application of the S. suis serotype 2 strain 10Deltaofs2/12 elicited humoral immune responses against different S. suis antigens but failed to induce sufficient opsonizing antibody titers and protective immunity against systemic serotypes 2 and 9 challenges.
TI  - Immunization with SsEno fails to protect mice against challenge with Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - In our ongoing efforts to develop a vaccine against Streptococcus suis infection, we tested the potential of S. suis enolase (SsEno), a recently described S. suis adhesin with fibronectin-binding activity, as a vaccine candidate in a mouse model of S. suis-induced septicemia and meningitis. Here, we show that SsEno is highly recognized by sera from convalescent pigs and is highly immunogenic in mice. Subcutaneous immunization of mice with SsEno elicited strong immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody responses. All four IgG subclasses were induced, with IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b representing the highest titers followed by IgG3. However, SsEno-vaccinated and nonvaccinated control groups showed similar mortality rates after challenge infection with the highly virulent S. suis strain 166'. Similar results were obtained upon passive immunization of mice with hyperimmunized rabbit IgG anti-SsEno. We also showed that anti-SsEno antibodies did not increase the ability of mouse phagocytes to kill S. suis in vitro. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that although recombinant SsEno formulated with Quil A triggers a strong antibody response, it does not confer effective protection against infection with S. suis serotype 2 in mice.
TI  - Biological activity and identification of a peptide inhibitor of LuxS from Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - The virulence of bacterial communities may be regulated by mechanisms involving the synthesis of the quorum-sensing signal autoinducer 2 (AI-2), which allows both intra- and interspecies communication. AI-2 is produced in bacteria that express the gene luxS. In the present study, expressed and purified LuxS from Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) was used to catalyze the substrate S-ribosylhomocysteine in a reaction that leads to the production of AI-2. The biological activity of the in vitro synthesized AI-2 was demonstrated in a Vibrio harveyi strain BB170 bioassay; real-time PCR results showed that biosynthesis of AI-2 can increase the virulence of SS2. Phage-encoded peptides that specifically interact with the LuxS enzyme were selected following three rounds of phage display. One such peptide inhibitor (TNRHNPHHLHHV) of LuxS was shown to partially inhibit the activity of the enzyme. Furthermore, 14 peptides containing the consensus sequence HSIR showed high affinity with LuxS. The selected and characterized specific inhibitor as well as the high-affinity ligands may facilitate the identification of new vaccination targets, opening up new approaches to the development of therapeutic drugs.
TI  - Inactivation of dipeptidyl peptidase IV attenuates the virulence of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 that causes streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.
AB  - Di-peptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV), originally recognized as CD26 in eukaryotic cells, is distributed widely in microbial pathogens, including Streptococcus suis (S. suis), an emerging zoonotic agent. However, the role of DPP IV in S. suis virulence remains unclear. Here, we identified a dpp IV homologue from highly invasive isolate of S. suis 2 (SS2) causing streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS). Enzymatic assays reproduced its enzymatic activity of dpp IV protein product as a functional DPP IV, and ELISA analysis demonstrated that SS2 DPP IV can interact with human fibronectin. An isogenic SS2 mutant of dpp IV, Delta dpp IV, was obtained by homologous recombination. Experimental animal infection suggested that an inactivation of dpp IV attenuates greatly its high virulence of Chinese virulent strains of SS2. Functional complementation can restore this defect in SS2 pathogenicity. To our knowledge, it may confirm, for the first time, that DPP IV contributes to SS2 virulence.
TI  - Identification of three novel in vivo-induced expressed antigens during infection with Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is a porcine and human pathogen with adhesive and invasive properties. The shortage of studies on the pathogenesis mechanisms of SS2 has made it very difficult to control infection with this pathogen. Three novel in vivo-induced antigens were identified using serological proteome analysis of the SS2 cell wall-associated proteins--SecA, autolysin and ZnuA--the upregulation of which in vivo relative to in vitro was shown by real-time PCR analysis. The in vivo-induced expression of znuA was also confirmed by the fact that the purified recombinant ZnuA could be recognized not by hyperimmune sera but by convalescent sera. This is, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first report using an immunoproteomic method to identify in vivo-induced antigens of SS2.
TI  - Vaccination with Streptococcus suis serotype 2 recombinant 6PGD protein provides  protection against S. suis infection in swine.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S. suis 2 or SS2) is the causative agent of several diseases in both pigs and humans. 6-Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD) is a cell surface protein in SS2. In this study, the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of recombinant 6PGD (r6PGD) from SS2 was evaluated in piglets. Immunization with an r6PGD-containing adjuvant induced a vigorous immunoglobulin G (IgG) response, with the titer of IgG2 being higher than that of IgG1. Immunization of piglets with r6PGD yielded 50% survival upon an intravenous challenge with a lethal dose of SS2. Piglets immunized with the r6PDG vaccine were better protected than those immunized with the adjuvant control. The clinical signs and histopathological changes in the piglets were recorded. Collectively, these results suggest that r6PGD can confer partial protection against SS2 infection and could be useful for the development of subunit vaccines against SS2.
TI  - Contribution of glutamine synthetase to the virulence of Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S. suis 2) is an important pathogen, responsible for diverse diseases in swine and human. In this study, we investigated the role of the glutamine synthetase (GlnA) in the pathogenesis of S. suis 2 in mice. To assess the contribution of glutamine synthetase (GlnA) to the virulence of S. suis 2, an knockout mutant (DeltaglnA) unable to produce GlnA was constructed, and the virulence level of wild-type (WT) SC19 and the DeltaglnA mutant strain were compared in an in vitro adherence assay and murine infection models. The data showed that DeltaglnA mutant exhibited a significant decrease in adherence to the epithelial cells HEp-2. The DeltaglnA mutant strain was attenuated and could reduce mortality and morbidity in murine infection models. Furthermore, organ cultures showed that GlnA plays a role in the colonization of the specific organs involved in S. suis infection. Functional complementation of the glnA gene into the knockout mutant DeltaglnA or incubated with extracellular glutamine restored its ability to adhere to the epithelial cells HEp-2. These findings suggested that glnA is required for the full virulence in S. suis 2. Therefore, the DeltaglnA mutant was considered as an attenuated mutant.

TI  - Expression levels of immune markers in Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae infected pigs and their relation to breed and clinical symptoms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In pigs little is known about the role of innate immune defence in bacterial infections of the respiratory tract, despite their major role in pig production. In the present study we characterized and compared in vitro and in vivo activation of immune markers of different pig breeds 7 days before, and 4 and 21 days after an experimental aerosol infection with Actinobacillus (A.) pleuropneumoniae. RESULTS: In vitro stimulation of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and blood leukocytes with A. pleuropneumoniae, Streptococcus suis, PMA and LPS led to production of different amounts of H2O2, NO and TNF-alpha, depending on the stimulus, individual, breed and time of infection. Generally, significant responses to in vitro stimulation were observed only in blood leukocytes, whereas the alveolar macrophages showed a high basal activation. In addition, the production of haptoglobin and cytokines (TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and IL-10) in vivo was measured in plasma and BALF. Plasma haptoglobin levels mirrored the clinical manifestations at 4 days post-infection. In plasma and BALF TNF-alpha could not be detected, whereas variable levels of IFN-gamma were found at pre- and post-infection times. IL-10 was found in some plasma but in none of the BALF samples. The different expression levels in individuals within the breeds correlated for some markers with the severity of clinical manifestations, e.g. H2O2, plasma haptoglobin and BALF IFN-gamma for German Landrace pigs. CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed differences in the activation of the immune markers with respect to infection time, individuals and breeds. Moreover, results showed different correlation grades between the immune markers produced in vitro or in vivo and the clinical manifestations. Further analyses will have to show whether these markers may serve as correlates of protection against porcine respiratory infections.

TI  - Protective capacities of cell surface-associated proteins of Streptococcus suis mutants deficient in divalent cation-uptake regulators.
AB  - Many cell surface-associated, divalent cation-regulated proteins are immunogenic, and some of them confer protection against the bacterial species from which they are derived. In this work, two Streptococcus suis divalent cation uptake regulator genes controlling zinc/manganese and iron uptake (adcR and fur, respectively) were inactivated in order to study the protective capacities of their cell surface-associated proteins. The results obtained showed overexpression of a set of immunogenic proteins (including members of the pneumococcal histidine triad family previously reported to confer protection against streptococcal pathogens) in S. suis adcR mutant cell surface extracts. Likewise, genes encoding zinc transporters, putative virulence factors and a ribosomal protein paralogue related to zinc starvation appeared to be derepressed in this mutant strain. Moreover, protection assays in mice showed that although neither adcR- nor fur-regulated cell surface-associated proteins were sufficient to confer protection in mice, the combination of both adcR- and fur-regulated cell surface-associated proteins is able to confer significant protection (50 %, P=0.038) against a challenge to mice vaccinated with them.
TI  - Association of Streptococcus pluranimalium with valvular endocarditis and septicaemia in adult broiler parents.
AB  - The genus Streptococcus consists of more than 60 species, but only Streptococcus  equi subspecies zooepidemicus, Streptococcus gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus, Streptococcus gallinaceus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus suis have been isolated from poultry. During investigations of the aetiology of increased mortality in broiler parent stock at the end of production, pure cultures of streptococcal-like organisms that could not be classified among these six species were obtained from 24 cases of septicaemia or valvular endocarditis and septicaemia. Phenotypic characterization using the API20 STREP kit identified the isolates as Aerococcus viridans (10), Aerococcus urinae (2), Leuconostoc species (4), Streptococcus salivarius (2), Streptococcus bovis II 3 (1), Enterococcus avium (3), Enterococcus faecium (1) or Gemella morbillorum (1). However, this identification was misleading as subsequent genetic investigations using pulse field gel electrophoresis and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes showed that 19 isolates were classified as Streptococcus pluranimalium, while the remaining isolates were E. avium (3), E. faecium (1) or Lactobacillus species (1). Misidentification by API20 STREP was related to the database provided by the manufacturer, as the phenotypic characteristics could identify these organisms as S. pluranimalium. The isolates of S. pluranimalium belonged to at least three different clones as determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis of SmaI-digested genomic DNA. The capacity that these isolates had to colonize the valvular endothelium was suggested by the occurrence of valvular endocarditis in 12 of 19 cases. Demonstration of the same clone in all four houses on a farm suggested the pathogenic potential of this organism.

TI  - Genetic organization and preferential distribution of putative pilus gene clusters in Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Recent analyses of Streptococcus suis isolates using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) suggested the importance of sequence type (ST) 1 and ST27 complexes for animal hygiene and public health. In this study, to investigate whether pilus-associated genes in S. suis can be used as novel genetic markers for important clonal groups, we examined the correlation between STs and putative pilus-associated gene profiles in S. suis. Genomic searches using sequenced genomes and sequence data determined in several isolates revealed the presence of at least four distinct putative pilus gene clusters in S. suis (srtBCD, srtE, srtF, and srtG clusters). On the basis of the presence or absence of genes in the four clusters, 108 S. suis isolates from various origins were classified into 12 genotypes (genotypes A-L). Genotypes A and B, which possessed srtBCD plus srtF clusters and srtF plus srtG clusters, respectively, were the most common in isolates from diseased pigs and humans, and 29.9% and 59.8% of the isolates belonged to genotypes A and B, respectively. In contrast, only 4.8% and 28.6% of isolates from healthy carriers were genotypes A and B, respectively. MLST analysis showed the associations of genotypes A and B with ST1 and ST27 complexes, respectively. In addition, srtBCD and srtG clusters were preferentially distributed to ST1 and ST27 complex members, respectively. These results suggest that profiling of selected pilus-associated genes could be used as an easy screening method to monitor isolates important for S. suis infection.
TI  - Hearing and vestibular loss in Streptococcus suis infection from swine and traditional raw pork exposure in northern Thailand.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe a series of 40 culture-proven, Streptococcus suis infected patients, focusing on route of entry and on hearing and vestibular dysfunction. METHODS: Retrospective study of patient records in a tertiary care hospital in northern Thailand, 2003-2007. RESULTS: The majority (75 per cent) of cases were men with heavy drinking habits. A past history of the consumption of raw pork and/or pig's blood was found in 62.5 per cent of cases, whereas contact with swine products was found in 25 per cent. Thirty patients presented with sepsis, 19 with meningitis and 10 with infective endocarditis. The overall mortality rate was 20 per cent. After a mean follow up of 17 months, 73 per cent of the surviving meningitis cases had persistent sensorineural hearing loss and 50 per cent demonstrated vestibular impairment. In one patient, roentgenographic studies of the temporal bone were compatible with labyrinthitis ossificans. CONCLUSIONS: Permanent hearing loss and vestibular impairment occur frequently in persons surviving meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis.
TI  - [Identification and detection of trag: a new infection-related gene expressed in  vivo from isolates of Streptococcus suis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The trag (transfer gene G) was one of the novel infection-related factors identified by in vivo-induced antigen technology (IVIAT) from Streptococcus suis type 2 expression libraries with swine convalesecent sera in our former research. We detected the distribution of trag in different Streptococcus suis isolates and identify the differential expression of the new infection-related factor between in vivo and in vitro condition. METHODS: According to the sequence of trag of North American strain 89/1591, a pair of primers were designed to detect the distribution of trag in total 43 SS isolates. Another pair of primers were designed to amplify the ORF of trag of 5 SS representive strains (ZY05719, HA9801, 98012, SH040805, SH040917). Partial gene of trag was cloned and inserted into expression vector pET28a(+), and induced by IPTG to express recombinant TRAG. The recombinant protein was probed with swine convalescent sera and immune sera respectively. RESULTS: The trag was detected in the most of SS2 isolates (30/32), in SS9 isolates (4/6), and 1 isolate of SS7, while it was not found in SS2 European strain ATCC43765, avirulent strain SS2 T15, 1 isolates of SS1, 1 isolates of SS1/2 and 2 isolates of group C streptococcal strains from pigs. Comparisons between the sequences of TRAG of 5 isolates with that of SS isolates, showed a high homology (>97%) with North American strain 89/1589 and China strains 98HAH33, 05ZYH33. The immunoreactivity was only presented with convalescent sera. CONCLUSION: The trag was detected from virulent SS isolates but not from avirulent strain, which suggested that this gene may be related to the pathogenicity of SS. The special reactivity was only present with convalescent sera, and it indicated that TRAG might play a role during SS2 invasive course.
TI  - Purified recombinant phage lysin LySMP: an extensive spectrum of lytic activity for swine streptococci.
AB  - Bacteriophage lysin has attracted considerable attentions as possible antimicrobial agents for solution of antibiotic resistance. SMP was a Streptococcus suis serotype 2 bacteriophage isolated from nasal swabs of healthy Bama minipigs. The putative SMP bacteriophage lysin, designated LySMP, was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli BL21, and chromatographically purified. Treated with 0.8% of beta-mercaptoethanol, LySMP exhibited an extensive lysin spectrum than those of whole phage against bacteria investigated. S. suis serotype 2, S. suis serotype 7 and S. suis serotype 9 strains were recovered from diseased pigs between 1998 and 2005 in China. Fifteen of seventeen strains of S. suis serotype 2 could be lysed, as well as S. suis serotype 7 and 9, Streptococcus equi ssp. zooepidemicus and Staphylococcus aureus. But E. coli and Salmonella enterica were not affected. Purified LySMP showed high degrading efficiency against PMSF or lysozyme treated cells comparing to PBS washed cells. Optimum pH and temperature conditions for the lysin were investigated by turbidity reduction assay. The lysin exerted efficient lysis activity at 37 degrees C, pH 5.2. The turbidity of bacterium investigated was observed to decrease by 1.2-68% in 30 min. Result indicated that putative LySMP could be a candidate antimicrobial agent in controlling S. suis infection.
TI  - Streptococcus plurextorum sp. nov., isolated from pigs.
AB  - Biochemical and molecular genetic studies were performed on an unknown Gram-positive, catalase-negative, coccus-shaped organism isolated from clinical samples from pigs. On the basis of the results of cellular morphological and biochemical tests, the organism was identified as a streptococcal species. 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons confirmed its identification as a member of the genus Streptococcus, but the organism was distinct from any recognized species of this genus. The closest phylogenetic relative of the unknown organism corresponded to Streptococcus suis NCTC 10234(T) (97.2 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity) and this phylogenetic position was confirmed by analysis of rpoB and sodA sequences. DNA-DNA hybridization studies showed that the unidentified organism produced a DNA reassociation value of 36.6 % with respect to S. suis NCTC 10234(T). The novel bacterium was distinguished from S. suis and other Streptococcus species using biochemical tests. On the basis of phenotypic and phylogenetic data, the unidentified organism represents a novel species of the genus Streptococcus, for which the name Streptococcus plurextorum sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 1956-02(T) (=CECT 7308(T)=CCUG 52972(T)).
TI  - The orphan response regulator RevSC21 controls the attachment of Streptococcus suis serotype-2 to human laryngeal epithelial cells and the expression of virulence genes.
AB  - Streptococcus suis-2 is an important zoonotic pathogen that causes serious diseases such as meningitis, septicemia, endocarditis, arthritis and septic shock in pigs and humans. Little is known about the regulation of virulence gene expression in S. suis-2. In the present study, we characterized an orphan transcriptional regulator, designated RevSC21. The RevSC21 gene was cloned and the sequence was determined. Deletion of the revSC21 gene of S. suis-2 yielded a mutant strain, SC211, which exhibited a significant decrease in adherence to cell line Hep-2, and lacked hemolytic activity. Quantification of expression levels of known S. suis-2 SC21 virulence genes by real-time PCR in vitro and in vivo revealed that RevSC21 influences the expression of mrp, ef, sly, fbps, sod, rpob, gyra hyl, cps and gapdh virulence-associated genes. SC211 was shown to be attenuated in a 50% lethal dose assay and bacteriology, indicating that RevSC21 plays an important part in the pathogenesis of S. suis-2 infection. Mutant SC211 was 100% defective in virulence in CD1 mice at up to 10(7) CFU, and provided 100% protection when challenged with 10(7) CFU of the SC21 strain.

TI  - Identification of Streptococcus suis genes preferentially expressed under iron starvation by selective capture of transcribed sequences.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is a zoonotic Gram-positive bacterium responsible for arthritis, meningitis, pneumonia and septicemia in swine and humans. Little information about the regulation of iron on its gene expression had been reported. In this study, 63 S. suis genes upregulated under an iron-restricted condition were identified using selective capture of transcribed sequences (SCUTS) technique: 23 genes involved in metabolism, 22 genes responsible for the replication and genetic information proceeding of the bacteria, eight genes relative to the construction of the cell wall, five ATP-binding cassette transporters, four transcriptional regulators and one uncharacterized gene conserved among streptococcal species. To adapt to the stress, S. suis modulated its physiological activities, which were validated by the upregulation of RelA (a crucial enzyme in stringent response), ArcA (a component of the arginine deiminase system catalyzing the conversion of arginine to ornithine) and CpdB (a cell surface protein that is a substrate of sortase A). All of them were reported to be virulence factors in S. suis or other bacteria. Besides, together with the results of quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR, we found that several homologous genes (fur, fhuGBDA operons) associated with iron uptake as reported in other bacteria were also upregulated under an iron-restricted condition in S. suis.
TI  - Streptococcus suis: an emerging human pathogen.
AB  - Streptococcus suis infection is acquired through exposure to contaminated pigs or pig meat. Over the past few years, the number of reported S. suis infections in humans has increased significantly, with most cases originating in Southeast Asia, where there is a high density of pigs. Increased awareness, improved diagnostics, and the occurrence of outbreaks have contributed to this increase. Meningitis and sepsis are the most common clinical manifestations of S. suis infection; hearing loss is a frequent complication. In this article, we provide an overview of the emergence and clinical manifestations of S. suis infection.
TI  - Characterization of Streptococcus suis isolates from the diseased pigs in China between 2003 and 2007.
AB  - The aim of this study was to illustrate the characteristics of 407 strains of Streptococcus suis (S. suis) isolated from diseased pigs in China. The results revealed that S. suis, with 56.6% of the Streptococci isolates, had replaced Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus as the predominant agent. Among the strains investigated, serotype 2 (43.2%) was most prevalent, followed by serotypes 3 (14.7%) and 4, 8, 5, 7, 1/2 (3.2-6.4%). Serotype 2 was more frequently isolated from swine with systemic infection, while serotype 3 was significantly associated with pneumonia. A high percentage of S. suis serotype 2 strains (54%) belonged to the genotype sly+ mrp+ epf+, which is a highly virulent strain, as confirmed by mice infection test. Biofilm producers only had lowly virulence compared to strains with the same genotype, indicating that biofilm could be associated with virulence but be not the character of virulent strains. The present study contributes to understanding the characteristics of Streptococcus suis and controlling Streptococcal disease in China.
TI  - The orphan response regulator CovR: a globally negative modulator of virulence in Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is an emerging zoonotic pathogen responsible for a  wide range of life-threatening diseases in pigs and humans. However, the pathogenesis of S. suis serotype 2 infection is not well understood. In this study, we report that an orphan response regulator, CovR, globally regulates gene expression and negatively controls the virulence of S. suis 05ZYH33, a streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS)-causing strain. A covR-defective (DeltacovR) mutant of 05ZYH33 displayed dramatic phenotypic changes, such as formation of longer chains, production of thicker capsules, and increased hemolytic activity. Adherence of the DeltacovR mutant to epithelial cells was greatly increased, and its resistance to phagocytosis and killing by neutrophils and monocytes was also significantly enhanced. More importantly, inactivation of covR increased the lethality of S. suis serotype 2 in experimental infection of piglets, and this phenotype was restored by covR complementation. Colonization experiments also showed that the DeltacovR mutant exhibited an increased ability to colonize susceptible tissues of piglets. The pleiotropic phenotype of the DeltacovR mutant is in full agreement with the large number of genes controlled by CovR as revealed by transcription profile analysis: 2 genes are positively regulated, and 193 are repressed, including many that encode known or putative virulence factors. These findings suggested that CovR is a global repressor in virulence regulation of STSS-causing S. suis serotype 2.
TI  - Structural insight into the catalytic mechanism of gluconate 5-dehydrogenase from Streptococcus suis: Crystal structures of the substrate-free and quaternary complex enzymes.
AB  - Gluconate 5-dehydrogenase (Ga5DH) is an NADP(H)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes a reversible oxidoreduction reaction between D-gluconate and 5-keto-D-gluconate, thereby regulating the flux of this important carbon and energy source in bacteria. Despite the considerable amount of physiological and biochemical knowledge of Ga5DH, there is little physical or structural information available for this enzyme. To this end, we herein report the crystal structures of Ga5DH from pathogenic Streptococcus suis serotype 2 in both substrate-free and liganded (NADP(+)/D-gluconate/metal ion) quaternary complex forms at 2.0 A resolution. Structural analysis reveals that Ga5DH adopts a protein fold similar to that found in members of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, while the enzyme itself represents a previously uncharacterized member of this family. In solution, Ga5DH exists as a tetramer that comprised four identical approximately 29 kDa subunits. The catalytic site of Ga5DH shows considerable architectural similarity to that found in other enzymes of the SDR family, but the S. suis protein contains an additional residue (Arg104) that plays an important role in the binding and orientation of substrate. The quaternary complex structure provides the first clear crystallographic evidence for the role of a catalytically important serine residue and also reveals an amino acid tetrad RSYK that differs from the SYK triad found in the majority of SDR enzymes. Detailed analysis of the crystal structures reveals important contributions of Ca(2+) ions to active site formation and of specific residues at the C-termini of subunits to tetramer assembly. Because Ga5DH is a potential target for therapy, our findings provide insight not only of catalytic mechanism, but also suggest a target of structure-based drug design.
TI  - Pathologic analysis of the brain from Streptococcus suis type 2 experimentally infected pigs.
AB  - Streptococcus suis type 2 (S. suis 2) is known as a major porcine pathogen worldwide and causes meningitis, septicemia, endocarditis, arthritis, and septic shock in pigs. Suilysin, a secreted protein of S. suis 2, is considered to be an important S. suis 2 virulence-associated factor. In this paper, the cerebellar lesions following experimental infection of pigs with S. suis 2 were studied. An immunohistochemical technique was applied to compare the distribution of bacteria and secreted suilysin protein in brain. The infected pigs developed histologic lesions of meningoencephalitis. Immunohistochemistry identified bacteria within the cytoplasm of neutrophils and macrophages localized in meningeal lesions. The secreted suilysin protein showed a similar localization within the cytoplasm of inflammatory cells, indicating that suilysin had high expression in vivo and may contribute to the pathogenesis of streptococcal meningoencephalitis.

METHODS: Genes and DNA fragments were amplified by PCR, using specific primers, and three amplified fragments of the 89K sequence were directly sequenced. The results were analyzed using software related to bioinformatics and epidemiology. RESULTS: 8 strains of SS2 all contained 89K sequence, cps2J and mrp virulent genes, and species-specific 16S rDNA. 3 amplified fragments of 89K candidate pathogenicity island of SS2 ZJ0501 were above 99% similar to SS2 strain identified from outbreaks in Jiangsu in 1998, and the gene fragment of coding DNA recombinant protein in the 89K sequence was highly homological with that of S. dysgalactiae and S.agalactiae. CONCLUSION: In recent years SS2 strains isolated from patients with clinical symptoms in Zhejiang province had been detected to have contained candidate pathogenic 89K DNA fragment.
TI  - Isolation, antimicrobial resistance, and virulence genes of Pasteurella multocida strains from swine in China.
AB  - A total of 233 isolates of Pasteurella multocida were obtained from 2,912 cases of clinical respiratory disease in pigs in China, giving an isolation rate of 8.0%. Serogroup A P. multocida isolates were isolated from 92 cases (39.5%), and serogroup D isolates were isolated from 128 cases (54.9%); 12 isolates (5.2%) were untypeable. P. multocida was the fourth most frequent pathogenic bacterium recovered from the respiratory tract, after Streptococcus suis, Haemophilus parasuis, and Escherichia coli. All isolates were characterized for their susceptibilities to 20 antibiotics and the presence of 19 genes for virulence factors (VFs). The frequency of antimicrobial resistance among P. multocida isolates from swine in China was higher than that reported among P. multocida isolates from swine in from other countries, and 93.1% of the isolates showed multiple-drug resistance. There was a progressive increase in the rate of multiresistance to more than seven antibiotics, from 16.2% in 2003 to 62.8% in 2007. The resistance profiles suggested that cephalosporins, florfenicol, and fluoroquinolones were the drugs most likely to be active against P. multocida. Use of PCR showed that colonization factors (ptfA, fimA, and hsf-2), iron acquisition factors, sialidases (nanH), and outer membrane proteins occurred in most porcine strains. The VFs pfhA, tadD, toxA, and pmHAS were each present in <50% of strains. The various VFs exhibited distinctive associations with serogroups: concentrated in serogroup A, concentrated in serogroup D, or occurring jointly in serogroups A and D. These findings provide novel insights into the epidemiological characteristics of porcine P. multocida isolates and suggest that the potential threat of such multiresistant bacteria in food-producing animals should not be neglected.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a novel protective antigen, Enolase of Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is a porcine and human pathogen with adhesive and invasive properties. The absence of suitable vaccine or virulent marker can be the bottleneck to control SS2 infection. In the present study, a novel immunogenic Enolase identified in the previous study was inducibly overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified recombinant protein could elicit a significant humoral antibody response and confer efficient immunity against challenge with lethal dose of SS2 or SS7 infection in mouse model. The roles Enolase plays in pathogenicity of SS2 were also explored as reasons for which Enolase could be a protective antigen. The Enolase was an in vivo-induced antigen confirmed by the real-time PCR and could adhere to the Hep-2 cells by the indirect immunofluorescent assay and the inhibition assay. These suggested that Enolase could play important roles in pathogenicity and may serve as a novel vaccine candidate against SS2 infection.
TI  - Endothelial cell/macrophage cocultures as a model to study Streptococcus suis-induced inflammatory responses.
AB  - Endothelial cells and macrophages are thought to play a critical role in the inflammatory response that contributes to meningitis. To investigate the interactions between Streptococcus suis and these two cell types, we developed a coculture model composed of brain microvascular endothelial cells and macrophage-like cells, and characterized the production of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) following a challenge with bacteria. Streptococcus suis cells stimulated the secretion of all the inflammatory mediators as well as MMP-9 in the coculture model. Responses to S. suis infection were influenced by endothelial cell/macrophage ratios and were dependent on the multiplicity of infection. Except for IL-6, significantly higher amounts of inflammatory mediators and MMP-9 were produced with the coculture model at an endothelial cell/macrophage ratio of 1 : 10 than at a ratio of 1 : 1. When infected with S. suis, endothelial cells and macrophages acted in synergy to increase the secretion of IL-6 and PGE(2). Using a model that more closely reproduces the in vivo situation, we showed that S. suis can induce the secretion of high levels of inflammatory mediators and MMP-9, which may contribute to the development of meningitis.

TI  - Streptococcus suis bacterin and subunit vaccine immunogenicities and protective efficacies against serotypes 2 and 9.
AB  - Streptococcus suis causes numerous diseases in pigs, most importantly, meningitis, arthritis, septicemia, and bronchopneumonia. One of the major problems in modern swine production is the lack of a vaccine protecting against more than one S. suis serotype. The objective of this study was to determine the protective efficacy of a serotype 2 murein-associated protein (MAP) fraction subunit vaccine in comparison to that of a bacterin against experimental challenge with serotype 2 (containing muramidase-released protein [MRP], extracellular factor, and suilysin [SLY]) and serotype 9 (containing MRP variant MRP* and SLY) strains. MAP was shown to include different surface-associated proteins, such as the MRP and surface antigen one (SAO) expressed by both pathotypes used for challenge. The results of this study demonstrated that the serotype 2 bacterin induced protective immunity against homologous challenge. In contrast, the protective efficacy of the MAP subunit vaccine was low, though MAP immunization resulted in high serum immunoglobulin G2 titers against MRP and SAO. Importantly, immunization with bacterin but not with MAP induced opsonizing antibody titers against the serotype 2 strain, and these antibody titers were found to correlate with protection. However, after absorption with a nonencapsulated isogenic mutant, the sera from bacterin-immunized piglets failed to facilitate neutrophil killing, indicating that antibodies directed against capsule may not have been essential for opsonophagocytosis. Furthermore, induction of opsonizing antibodies against serotype 9 was not detectable in the group receiving bacterin or in the group receiving the MAP vaccine. In agreement, protection against the heterologous serotype 9 strain was low in both groups. Thus, identification of an antigen protecting against these two important S. suis pathotypes remains an important goal of future studies.
TI  - Porcine brain microvascular endothelial cell-derived interleukin-8 is first induced and then degraded by Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is a major pathogen of swine, causing mainly meningitis, and it also represents an emerging zoonotic agent. We investigated its ability to induce the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by porcine brain microvascular endothelial cells (PBMEC). We demonstrated that live S. suis induced a strong release of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 by PBMEC. We showed that the suilysin (hemolysin) was largely responsible for such stimulation, although cell wall components also contribute to cell stimulation but to a considerably lower extent. Interestingly, IL-8 production by PBMEC became undetectable by increasing either the incubation time or bacterial concentration of certain live S. suis strains. We further demonstrated that this decrease of IL-8 levels was probably linked to the production of a serine protease by S. suis. Our results suggest that S. suis can induce an exacerbated release of inflammatory mediators by swine endothelial cells that could cause a massive recruitment of leukocytes and subsequent blood-brain barrier breakdown facilitating the pathogenesis of S. suis-induced meningitis. In addition, S. suis could modulate this response by degrading IL-8 which might delay recruitment of S. suis killer-neutrophils to the site of inflammation, allowing this pathogen to survive upon its arrival to central nervous system.
TI  - Overcoming function annotation errors in the Gram-positive pathogen Streptococcus suis by a proteomics-driven approach.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Annotation of protein-coding genes is a key step in sequencing projects. Protein functions are mainly assigned on the basis of the amino acid sequence alone by searching of homologous proteins. However, fully automated annotation processes often lead to wrong prediction of protein functions, and therefore time-intensive manual curation is often essential. Here we describe a fast and reliable way to correct function annotation in sequencing projects, focusing on surface proteomes. We use a proteomics approach, previously proven to be very powerful for identifying new vaccine candidates against Gram-positive pathogens. It consists of shaving the surface of intact cells with two proteases, the specific cleavage-site trypsin and the unspecific proteinase K, followed by LC/MS/MS analysis of the resulting peptides. The identified proteins are contrasted by computational analysis and their sequences are inspected to correct possible errors in function prediction. RESULTS: When applied to the zoonotic pathogen Streptococcus suis, of which two strains have been recently sequenced and annotated, we identified a set of surface proteins without cytoplasmic contamination: all the proteins identified had exporting or retention signals towards the outside and/or the cell surface, and viability of protease-treated cells was not affected. The combination of both experimental evidences and computational methods allowed us to determine that two of these proteins are putative extracellular new adhesins that had been previously attributed a wrong cytoplasmic function. One of them is a putative component of the pilus of this bacterium. CONCLUSION: We illustrate the complementary nature of laboratory-based and computational methods to examine in concert the localization of a set of proteins in the cell, and demonstrate the utility of this proteomics-based strategy to experimentally correct function annotation errors in sequencing projects. This approach also contributes to provide strong experimental evidences that can be used to annotate those proteins for which a Gene Ontology (GO) term has not been assigned so far. Function annotation correction would then improve the identification of surface-associated proteins in bacterial pathogens, thus accelerating the discovery of new vaccines in infectious disease research.

TI  - Exposure to Streptococcus suis among US swine workers.
AB  - Despite numerous cases of human infection with Streptococcus suis worldwide, human disease is rarely diagnosed in North America. We studied 73 swine-exposed and 67 non-swine-exposed US adults for antibodies to S. suis serotype 2. Serologic data suggest that human infection with S. suis occurs more frequently than currently documented.
TI  - Polar bacterial invasion and translocation of Streptococcus suis across the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier in vitro.
AB  - Previous experimental studies in a standard Transwell culture system have shown Streptococcus suis ability to compromise barrier function of porcine choroid plexus epithelial cells (PCPEC). The development of an 'inverted' Transwell filter system of PCPEC enables us now for the first time to investigate bacterial invasion and translocation from the physiologically relevant basolateral (blood) to the apical (cerebrospinal fluid) side. Most importantly, we observed specific invasion and translocation of S. suis across the PCPEC exclusively from the basolateral side. During this process, bacterial viability and the presence of a capsule as well as cytoskeletal regulation of PCPEC seemed to play an important role. No loss of barrier function was observed. Bacterial translocation could be significantly inhibited by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002, but not by its inactive analogue Ly303511 or dexamethasone. Apotome imaging as well as electron microscopy revealed intracellular bacteria often in cell vacuoles. Thus, possibly regulated by the presence of a capsule, S. suis induces signals that depend on the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, which paves the way for cellular uptake during the bacterial transcellular translocation process. Taken together, our data underline the relevance of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier as a gate for bacterial entry into the central nervous system.
TI  - Hemoglobin and Streptococcus suis cell wall act in synergy to potentiate the inflammatory response of monocyte-derived macrophages.
AB  - Streptococcus suis, a major swine pathogen world-wide, can trigger macrophages to secrete large amounts of proinflammatory cytokines, which increase the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. In this study, we hypothesized that hemoglobin may potentiate the inflammatory response of human macrophages stimulated with a S. suis cell-wall preparation. Monocyte-derived macrophages were stimulated with the S. suis cell-wall preparation in the presence or absence of human hemoglobin, and the secretion of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-6, and IL-8 was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The cell-wall preparation induced dose-dependent IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-8 responses in macrophages. Hemoglobin potentiated the cell-wall induced inflammatory response, resulting in a significantly higher secretion of all the cytokines. The S. suis cell-wall preparation in combination with hemoglobin activated macrophage intracellular kinases involved in inflammatory signaling pathways. In conclusion, hemoglobin, which may be released in vivo by the action of S. suis suilysin on red blood cells, contributes to raising the levels of pro-inflammatory mediators by acting in synergy with S. suis cell-wall components. This phenomenon may contribute to the development and the severity of meningitis.
TI  - [Streptococcus suis meningitis in an immunocompetent patient].
AB  - A case of Streptococcus suis meningitis is described in an immunocompetent patient presenting asthenia, general weakness, fever, vomiting, sensory deterioration and temporospatial disorder. The cerebrospinal fluid and two blood cultures (2/2 bottles) were positive. The isolate was preliminary identified by conventional biochemical tests, and the identification was completed at the Special Bacteriology Service of INEI-ANLIS "Dr. Carlos G. Malbran". Ampicillin and ceftriaxone treatment was initiated. The isolate was susceptible to ampicillin, cefotaxime and vancomycin. The patient experienced a good outcome but suffered hearing loss. However, after four months he returned with walking ataxia, deafness in his left ear, and hearing loss in the right ear. The patient's retrospective exposure to pigs had been verified. It is important to evaluate predisposing and epidemiologic factors in order to alert about the possible presence of this etiological agent in cases of meningitis or bacteremia.

TI  - Clinical, experimental, and genomic differences between intermediately pathogenic, highly pathogenic, and epidemic Streptococcus suis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus suis emerged to cause an unusual outbreak of streptococcal toxic-shock-like syndrome (STSLS) in 2005. The mechanisms involved are unknown. METHODS: Clinical, laboratory, and epidemiologic data on patients infected with culture-confirmed S. suis were analyzed. The strain involved in the outbreak, "epidemic" strain ST7, was compared with both a classical highly pathogenic strain, ST1, and an intermediately pathogenic strain, ST25, to determine both its capacity to induce cytokines in experimentally infected mice and its genomic difference. RESULTS: Of 38 patients infected with culture-confirmed S. suis, 14 presented with STSLS. During the early phase of the disease, serum levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12p70, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were more elevated in patients with STSLS than in those with meningitis only. Serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines were significantly higher in mice infected with ST7 than in those infected with either ST1 or ST25. Genomic comparisons with ST25 showed that ST1 had acquired 132 genomic islands, including 5 pathogenicity islands, and that ST7, the epidemic strain, had acquired an additional 5 genomic islands. CONCLUSION: Intermediately pathogenic strain ST25 has evolved to become highly pathogenic strain ST1, which, in turn, has more recently evolved to become epidemic strain ST7. ST7 has the ability to stimulate the production of massive amounts of proinflammatory cytokines, leading to STSLS.

TI  - Cloning, expression, purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (KDPG) aldolase from Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - 2-Keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (KDPG) adolase from pathogenic Streptococcus suis serotype 2 was crystallized using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method at 291 K. X-ray diffraction data were collected to 2.8 A resolution. The crystal belonged to space group R32, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 126.4, c = 415.9 A, alpha = beta = 90, gamma = 120 degrees . Assuming the presence of six molecules in the asymmetric unit gave a V(M) value of 2.32 A(3) Da(-1) and a solvent content of 47.12%.
TI  - Significant contribution of the pgdA gene to the virulence of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is a major swine pathogen and emerging zoonotic agent. In this study we have determined the muropeptide composition of S. suis peptidoglycan (PG) and found, among other modifications, N-deacetylated compounds. Comparison with an isogenic mutant showed that the product of the pgdA gene is responsible for this specific modification which occurred in very low amounts. Low level of PG N-deacetylation correlated with absence of significant lysozyme resistance when wild-type S. suis was grown in vitro. On the other hand, expression of the pgdA gene was increased upon interaction of the bacterium with neutrophils in vitro as well as in vivo in experimentally inoculated mice, suggesting that S. suis may enhance PG N-deacetylation under these conditions. Evaluation of the DeltapgdA mutant in both the CD1 murine and the porcine models of infection revealed a significant contribution of the pgdA gene to the virulence traits of S. suis. Reflecting a severe impairment in its ability to persist in blood and decreased ability to escape immune clearance mechanisms mediated by neutrophils, the DeltapgdA mutant was highly attenuated in both models. The results of this study suggest that modification of PG by N-deacetylation is an important factor in S. suis virulence.
TI  - New putative virulence factors of Streptococcus suis involved in invasion of porcine brain microvascular endothelial cells.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is an important pathogen causing a wide range of infections in swine, the most important being meningitis. Few virulence factors have been identified and the pathogenesis of infection is not well understood. Recently, we demonstrated the ability of S. suis to adhere to and invade porcine brain microvascular endothelial cells (PBMEC) forming the blood-brain barrier. In this paper we describe the screening of a mutant library, produced by insertion of transposon Tn917 into the chromosome of S. suis strain P1/7, for mutants that are less able to interact with PBMEC. Both qualitative and quantitative screening assays were used to identify poorly invasive mutants. Tn917 insertion sites from nineteen poorly invasive mutants were sequenced and characterized. Five mutants were selected and their virulence was assessed in a mouse model of infection. Two out of these five mutants were attenuated as measured by decreased colonization of organs, as well as reduced mortality and morbidity. When tested in swine these two attenuated mutants led to decreased bacterial loads in blood, less severe and delayed clinical signs, and lower plasma IL-6 levels than did infection with the wild-type strain. Overall, our results suggest that these two genes may contribute to the virulence of S. suis.
TI  - Autopsy report of four cases who died from Streptococcus suis infection, with a review of the literature.
AB  - There was an outbreak of human Streptococcus suis (S. suis) infection in southwest China in 2005. The total number of documented patients was 204 and 38 of them died. Four cases were autopsied and are reported in this paper. The autopsies showed that multiple organs were involved, with a prominent injury of the lung, kidney, and intestine. The essential pathologic changes were multiple microthrombi (hyaline thrombi) formation in the capillaries of various organs and tissues, accompanied by congestion and hemorrhage. The pathogen of the disease was S. suis, serotype 2, which was confirmed by means of germ culture of the heart, blood, and tissue samples at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC). The autopsy diagnosis of all four cases was septicemia with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The cause of death was toxic shock with multi-organ dysfunction. Combined with the epidemic features, clinical manifestations, etiological, and autopsy findings, it accorded with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS).
TI  - [Putative lipoproteins of Streptococcus suis type 2 identified by bioinformatic genome analysis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify putative lipoproteins of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2). METHODS: First, I used the ScanProsite feature of Prosite and the website Database Of bacterial LipOProteins (DOLOP) to identify putative lipoproteins in the recently published genome of SS2 strains 05ZYH33, then validated the identified putative lipoproteins to exclude the false positive by a 'majority vote' approach following analysis with standard tools for signal peptide verification. Finally, putative functions were attributed to individual lipoproteins by reference to the identification of conserved domains of InterPro. Homologous proteins were identified by unfiltered BlastP homology searches (including conserved domain detection). RESULTS: Among the 38 identified putative lipoproteins, 34 were validated as lipoprotein and 4 as false positive lipoproteins. The largest functional category (16/34, 44%) of lipoproteins was that predicted to comprise of substrate binding proteins of ATP-binding cassette transport systems. Other roles included lipoproteins that participated in adhesion (YP_001197698 and YP_001198710), protein export and folding. CONCLUSION: Lipoproteins contributed to the physiology of SS2 and influenced its virulence.
TI  - [Development of a protocol on pulsed field gel electrophoresis analysis for Streptococcus suis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a PFGE protocol for Streptococcus suis. METHODS: We developed and optimized a PFGE protocol for S. suis, in terms of plug preparation, choice of restriction endonucleases and optimized electrophoresis parameters. By analyzing the genome sequences of S. suis P1/7 with Mapdraw of DNAStar, we found three restriction enzymes, Swa I, Sma I and Apa I, were more suitable than others. RESULTS: Analysis of 100 isolates of S. suis including 34 of 35 serotypes identified, 59, 53 and 43 patterns were obtained from Swa I, Sma I and Apa I restriction, respectively. The enzyme Swa I had the greatest power for discrimination ability. CONCLUSION: By optimization of the protocol at various conditions, a rapid, reproducible, economic and practical PFGE method for S. suis was developed.
TI  - Detection of autoinducer-2 and analysis of the profile of luxS and pfs transcription in Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - The only quorum sensing (QS) system shared by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria involves the production of autoinducer-2 (AI-2). However, there have been no reports concerning the AI-2 in Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2). In this study, we investigated AI-2 production and analyzed the relationship between the transcription level of luxS and pfs and AI-2 production. A homologue of luxS, the gene required for AI-2 synthesis in Vibrio harveyi, was isolated from the SS2 genome. V. harveyi BB170 bioassay demonstrated luxS functionality in SS2 and its ability to complement the luxS-negative phenotype of Escherichia coli DH5alpha. Further studies showed that AI-2 activity peaked in the late exponential phase, and sodium chloride or glucose increased the production of AI-2. Real-time PCR showed that the level of transcription of pfs is highly correlated with the level of AI-2 production, while the level of transcription of luxS does not correlate with the level of AI-2 production. The results presented here demonstrate that SS2 can secrete AI-2 and that the profile of pfs transcription is highly correlated with the level of AI-2 production.
TI  - Identification and experimental verification of protective antigens against Streptococcus suis serotype 2 based on genome sequence analysis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S. suis 2) is an important zoonotic pathogen that  can cause severe disease and even death in both humans and swine. No effective vaccine is clinically available. In this study, a reverse vaccinology method was first applied to identify protective antigens against S. suis 2. As a consequence, 153 genes encoding vaccine candidates were selected from the whole genome sequence by means of bioinformatics analysis, from which 10 genes were selected based on experimental evidences arising from the study of related bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, group B streptococcus, S. suis and so on. Of 10 target genes, 8 were successfully expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta, and expressed proteins were purified and used as the immunogens for evaluating vaccine efficacy in a mouse infection model. The results have confirmed that RTX family exoprotein A (RfeA), epidermal surface antigen (ESA), immunoglobulin G (IgG)-binding protein (IBP), and suilysin (SLY) can induce a protective response of the vaccinated animals against S. suis 2, whereas RfeA, ESA, and IBP mainly induce humoral-mediated immunity, and SLY elicits a combined pattern of both humoral- and cellular-mediated immunity. Although immunoprotection of SLY against S. suis 2 was reported previously, RfeA, ESA, and IBP were explored first in this study.

TI  - Streptococcus suis infection and risk factors for mortality.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Streptococcus suis infection is a re-emerging zoonotic disease reported worldwide. This study is aimed to describe the clinical features and determine the risk factors for mortality of this life-threatening disease. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted among patients diagnosed with culture-confirmed S. suis infection in a tertiary-care hospital in Northern Thailand during 2005-2007. Risk factors for mortality were determined by Cox's regression analysis. RESULTS: There were 66 patients with a mean age of 52.9 years; 68% were males. The most common risk of S. suis infection was eating under-cooked pork (59%). Clinical presentations included acute meningitis (52%), sepsis (27%), septic shock (12%), endocarditis (8%), and septic arthritis (1%). Hearing loss was observed in 35% and was associated with meningitis. The overall mortality rate was 17%; 11% occurred in 24h. Cox's regression revealed that septic shock (p=0.014) and elevated alanine transaminase (ALT, p=0.013) were risk factors for mortality. CONCLUSIONS: S. suis infection is common in Northern Thailand, where people often eat raw pork, and commonly presents with acute meningitis or sepsis. The mortality rate is high. The risk factors for mortality are septic shock and elevated ALT. Awareness of this disease and public education are essentially needed.
TI  - Streptococcus suis in retail markets: how prevalent is it in raw pork?
AB  - Streptococcus suis present in raw pork meats sold in local retail markets was enumerated by Most Probable Number (MPN)-PCR method. This method combined the conventional MPN technique with a specifically designed PCR assay based on the amplification of a 294-bp S. suis species-specific 16S rRNA gene sequence. A total of 78 raw pork lean meat samples purchased at two different supermarkets (Site A and B) and a wet market (Site C) were tested. Results indicated that S. suis could be detected from the enriched MPN tubes of all, except one, sample homogenates. The concentration of S. suis ranged from <3 to 4600 MPN/g of pork meat, with a total bacterial count (TBC) varying from 3.6 log to 7.4 log CFU/g. Statistical analyses indicated that pork meats purchased from the supermarket at Site B in summer contained significantly higher concentration of S. suis organisms than those from other retailers in any season. A significant correlation existed between log S. suis concentration and log TBC of the samples. This study revealed that raw pork meats available in local supermarkets or wet markets could contain S. suis at concentrations that were usually difficult to detect with traditional culture method. Field application of this method may contribute to a measurable evaluation, and thus the effective control, of human S. suis infection due to raw pork or pig carcass handling.
TI  - Mitogenic effect contributes to increased virulence of Streptococcus suis sequence type 7 to cause streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 sequence type 7 strains emerged in 1996 and caused  a streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome in 1998 and 2005 in China. Evidence indicated that the virulence of S. suis sequence type 7 had increased, but the mechanism was unknown. The sequence type 7 strain SC84, isolated from a patient with streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome during the Sichuan outbreak, and the sequence type 1 strain 31533, a typical highly pathogenic strain isolated from a diseased pig, were used in comparative studies. In this study we show the mechanisms underlying cytokine production differed between the two types of strains. The S. suis sequence type 7 strain SC84 possesses a stronger capacity to stimulate T cells, naive T cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation than does S. suis sequence type 1 strain 31533. The T cell response to both strains was dependent upon the presence of antigen-presenting cells. Histo-incompatible antigen-presenting cells were sufficient to provide the accessory signals to naive T cell stimulated by the two strains, indicating that both sequence type 7 and 1 strains possess mitogens; however, the mitogenic effect was different. Therefore, we propose that the difference in the mitogenic effect of sequence type 7 strain SC84 compared with the sequence type 1 strain 31533 of S. suis may be associated with the clinical, epidemiological and microbiological difference, where the ST 7 strains have a larger mitogenic effect.
TI  - Streptococcus suis stimulates ICAM-1 shedding from microvascular endothelial cells.
AB  - In this study, we hypothesized that Streptococcus suis induces the shedding of adhesion molecules from the surface of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC), which may contribute to the ongoing pathophysiological processes of meningitis. When HBMEC were stimulated with whole cells of S. suis S735, significantly larger amounts of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) were shed into conditioned medium while basal levels of soluble E-cadherin and P-selectin were unaffected. At a multiplicity of infection of 1 and 10, S. suis increased the concentration of sICAM-1 3.5- and 5-fold, respectively. A capsule-deficient mutant of S. suis induced more shedding than the parental strain. In addition, an S. suis cell wall preparation dose-dependently stimulated ICAM-1 shedding. Specific inhibitors of tyrosine kinase, mitogen-activated extracellular kinase 1, 2, and c-JUN N-terminal kinase significantly reduced S. suis-mediated ICAM-1 release. ICAM-1 shedding was also inhibited by a specific inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases. The capacity of S. suis to induce ICAM-1 shedding has many functional implications that may contribute to the pathophysiological process of meningitis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify antigenic proteins secreted by Streptococcus suis (S. suis) type 2 strain SC84. METHODS: Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE), western-blot assay and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) analysis were performed to search and identify antigenic proteins secreted by S. suis strain SC84, which triggered an outbreak of the disease in Sichuan province,China, in 2005. RESULTS: A total number of 14 western blot spots were found on PVDF membrane. 11 spots which could be found the existence of matching protein on coomassie G-250-stained 2-DE gel were identified by MALDI-TOF MS. The 11 proteins, all located at extra-cellular or cell wall, were classified into 8 kinds of proteins. Among of them, muramidase-released protein (MRP), suilysin (Sly) and extra-cellular factor (EF) were the known antigenic proteins, but several proteins such as putative 5'-nucleotidase, ribo-nucleases G and E, and predicted metal-loendo-peptidase were newly found antigenic proteins. All the identified protein were found to have had the coding gene in genomic of S. suis strain 05ZYH33, isolated from patients in Sichuan province, China in 2005. CONCLUSION: The newly found proteins could be used as voluntary antigens for detection and vaccination of S. suis.
TI  - [Construction of RevS gene knock-out mutant of Streptococcus suis serotype 2].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To construct a gene knock-out mutant of response regulator named RevS  in Streptococcus suis serotype 2 virulent strain 05ZYH33, and to investigate the effects of its deletion on the biological characters of this pathogen and the pathogenesis to mice and piglets. METHODS: Recombinant gene knock-out vector consisting of Spc(r) cassette was constructed and flanking was constructed consisting of Spc(r) cassette with flanking homology regions to the RevS genes while the isogenic RevS-deficient mutant was screened by allelic replacement. The effects of RevS deletion on the basic biological characters of 05ZYH33 including growth stability, colonial morphology, haemolysis, Gram staining, growth curve and protein expression were examined in vitro. The mice and piglets were infected with 10(8) CFU wild virulent and mutant isolates. RESULTS: PCR analysis confirmed that the coding genes of RevS were replaced completely by Spc(r) cassette and the basic biological characters of 05ZYH33 did not undergo any apparent change. Balb/c mice infection assay indicated that RevS play a role in the pathogenesis of Streptococcus suis infections, while no remarkable difference was observed in the piglets' pathogenesis infection rates between mutant isolates deltaA05ZYH33 and wild-type isolates 05ZYH33. CONCLUSION: The mutant of Streptococcus suis 05ZYH33 response regulator was successfully constructed, while the mutation did not obviously affect the bacterial biological characters, while the knock-out mutant of RevS was shown to be attenuated in pathogenesis to mice and piglets.
TI  - Development and use of a multiplex real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay for detection and differentiation of Porcine circovirus-2 genotypes 2a and 2b in an epidemiological survey.
AB  - By the end of 2004, the Canadian swine population had experienced a severe increase in the incidence of Porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD), a problem that was associated with the emergence of a new Porcine circovirus-2 genotype (PCV-2b), previously unrecovered in North America. Thus, it became important to develop a diagnostic tool that could differentiate between the old and new circulating genotypes (PCV-2a and PCV-2b, respectively). Consequently, a multiplex real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (mrtqPCR) assay that could sensitively and specifically identify and differentiate PCV-2 genotypes was developed. A retrospective epidemiologic survey that used the mrtqPCR assay was performed to determine if cofactors could affect the risk of PCVAD. From 121 PCV-2-positive cases gathered for this study, 4.13%, 92.56%, and 3.31% were positive for PCV-2a, PCV-2b, and both genotypes, respectively. In a data analysis using univariate logistic regressions, the PCVAD-compatible (PCVAD/c) score was significantly associated with the presence of Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), PRRSV viral load, PCV-2 viral load, and PCV-2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) results. Polytomous logistic regression analysis revealed that PCVAD/c score was affected by PCV-2 viral load (P = 0.0161) and IHC (P = 0.0128), but not by the PRRSV variables (P > 0.9), which suggests that mrtqPCR in tissue is a reliable alternative to IHC. Logistic regression analyses revealed that PCV-2 increased the odds ratio of isolating 2 major swine pathogens of the respiratory tract, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and Streptococcus suis serotypes 1/2, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7, which are serotypes commonly associated with clinical diseases.
TI  - Cultivation, LD(50) determination and experimental model of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 strain HA9801.
AB  - The effects of nutritional components and submerged culture conditions on colony-forming unit (CFU) counts by Streptococcus suis serotype 2 strain HA9801 in flask culture was investigated, and the optimal medium and cultivation conditions was confirmed by using a 50l bioreactor. The LD(50) values of HA9801 in pigs before and after fermentation were 1.8 x 10(7)CFU, which indicated that the virulence of HA9801 was very stable in the fermentation process. In addition, an experimental model that closely mimics naturally occurring disease in conventional pigs was established.
TI  - Identification and distribution of putative virulent genes in strains of Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - In order to identify gene sequences unique to the virulent strains, suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) was conducted using virulent Streptococcus suis type 2 (SS2) strain HA9801 and avirulent S. suis type 2 strain T15. Thirty genomic regions were absent in T15, and the DNA sequences of these regions in HA9801 were determined. These DNA fragments, containing putative virulence genes, encoded 28 proteins that were homologous to proteins involved in various aspects of cellular surface structure, molecular synthesis, energy metabolism, regulation, transport systems and others of unknown function. According to the published SS2 genomic sequence of the Chinese strain 98HAH33, PCR primers for 14 significant DNA fragments were designed and used for detection of the distribution of these fragments in S. suis strains from different sources, serotypes, regions, groups and times. The results showed that these 14 DNA fragments were widely distributed in 37 detected SS2 strains, yet were absent among the avirulent strain T15. Moreover, these fragments could be detected in other serotypes of S. suis, but each serotype had a different distribution of the fragments.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of alpha-enolase, a novel fibronectin-binding protein from Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important swine pathogen that causes meningitis, endocarditis, arthritis and septicaemia. As a zoonotic agent, S. suis also causes similar diseases in humans. Binding of pathogenic bacteria to extracellular matrix components enhances their adhesion to and invasion of host cells. In the present study we isolated and identified a novel fibronectin-binding protein from S. suis. The native protein (designated SsEno) possessed not only high homology with other bacterial enolases but also enolase activity. We cloned, expressed and purified SsEno and showed that it is ubiquitously expressed by all S. suis serotypes and we identified its surface localization using immunoelectron microscopy. ELISA demonstrated that SsEno binds specifically to fibronectin and plasminogen in a lysine-dependent manner. Additional surface plasmon resonance assays demonstrated that SsEno binds to fibronectin or plasminogen with low nanomolar affinity. Inhibition experiments with anti-SsEno antibodies also showed that bacterial SsEno is important for the adhesion to and invasion of brain microvascular endothelial cells by S. suis. Overall, the present work is the first study, to our knowledge, to demonstrate a fibronectin-binding activity of a bacterial enolase, and shows that, similar to other bacterial fibronectin-binding proteins, SsEno may contribute to the virulence of S. suis.
TI  - [MLST typing of Streptococcus suis isolated from clinical patients in Guangdong Province in 2005].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Intensive surveillance of human S.suis infection was carried out in July and August of 2005 in Guangdong Province, which coincided with the Sichuan outbreak. Five isolated cases of human infections were identified during this period, from which 5 S. suis serotype 2 isolates were recovered. MLST analysis showed that these 5 isolates shared identical sequences of 6 MLST housekeeping genes except for one point mutation found within the thrA gene fragment, a neutral mutation (TTA to TTG) in the third nucleotide (360 nt) of the codon for leucine. MLST analysis identified 2 sequence types in the Guangdong sporadic infection. Three Guangdong isolates L-SS002, L-SS003 and L-SS005 belonged to ST7, while the other two isolates L-SS004 and L-SS006 belonged to ST1, but they all belonged to ST1 clonal complex. This finding represents a striking feature that differs from the Sichuan outbreak caused by a single ST7 SS2 clone. The 3 isolates of ST7 were probably imported from Sichuan Province, while the origin of the other 2 isolates of ST1 still remain to be clarified.
TI  - Meningitis in a butcher.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is a common pathogen in swine and infection in humans is rarely reported. When it does occur, it is considered an occupational risk associated with the handling of carcasses. Meningitis is one of the most life-threatening manifestations of S suis infection. This case of meningitis in a butcher is reported to create awareness of this zoonotic disease. The report highlights the importance of an occupational history and a meticulous general physical examination looking for cuts and abrasions in patients with suspicion of meningitis.
TI  - Functional definition and global regulation of Zur, a zinc uptake regulator in a  Streptococcus suis serotype 2 strain causing streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.
AB  - Zinc is an essential trace element for all living organisms and plays pivotal roles in various cellular processes. However, an excess of zinc is extremely deleterious to cells. Bacteria have evolved complex machineries (such as efflux/influx systems) to control the concentration at levels appropriate for the maintenance of zinc homeostasis in cells and adaptation to the environment. The Zur (zinc uptake regulator) protein is one of these functional members involved in the precise control of zinc homeostasis. Here we identified a zur homologue designated 310 from Streptococcus suis serotype 2, strain 05ZYH33, a highly invasive isolate causing streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Biochemical analysis revealed that the protein product of gene 310 exists as a dimer form and carries zinc ions. An isogenic gene replacement mutant of gene 310, the Delta310 mutant, was obtained by homologous recombination. Physiological tests demonstrated that the Delta310 mutant is specifically sensitive to Zn(2+), while functional complementation of the Delta310 mutant can restore its duration capability, suggesting that 310 is a functional member of the Zur family. Two-dimensional electrophoresis indicated that nine proteins in the Delta310 mutant are overexpressed in comparison with those in the wild type. DNA microarray analyses suggested that 121 genes in the Delta310 mutant are affected, of which 72 genes are upregulated and 49 are downregulated. The transcriptome of S. suis serotype 2 with high Zn(2+) concentrations also showed 117 differentially expressed genes, with 71 upregulated and 46 downregulated. Surprisingly, more than 70% of the genes differentially expressed in the Delta310 mutant were the same as those in S. suis serotype 2 that were differentially expressed in response to high Zn(2+) concentration, consistent with the notion that 310 is involved in zinc homeostasis. We thus report for the first time a novel zinc-responsive regulator, Zur, from Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
TI  - The involvement of sortase A in high virulence of STSS-causing Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Sortase A (SrtA), originally identified as a transpeptidase in Staphylococcus aureus, plays key roles in full virulence of pathogenic bacteria. In silico genome-wide search suggested a srtA homologue from 05ZYH33, a Chinese human isolate of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS)-causing Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S. suis 2, SS2). An isogenic srtA mutant (DeltasrtA) of 05ZYH33 strain was obtained by homologous recombination. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that two known virulence-associated surface proteins featuring Leu-Pro-X-Thr-Gly motif, muramidase-released protein and surface antigen one, were absent in the DeltasrtA. Piglet infection experiments showed that deletion of srtA attenuated the full virulence of 05ZYH33 strain, and impaired its colonizing potential in specific organs. Furthermore, the DeltasrtA displayed significant reduction in adherence to human cells (Hep-2 and human umbilical vein endothelial cells). Collectively, we concluded that SrtA was involved in the virulence manifestation of STSS-causing SS2.
TI  - [Study on the epidemiologic characteristics of human Streptococcus suis infection in Hechi city, Guangxi].
AB  
TI  - [Study on molecular epidemiology of major pathogenic Streptococcus suis serotypes in middle part of Jiangsu province].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of Streptococcus suis and major pathogenic serotypes in middle part of Jiangsu province. METHODS: Tonsillar specimens from 303 slaughtered pigs aged 6 to 8 months were investigated for the presence of Streptococcus suis and major pathogenic serotypes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Bacteriological examination compared with molecular genetics identification for three Streptococcus suis isolates were also done. RESULTS: The overall carrier rate of Streptococcus suis was up to 88.0%, with the percentages of serotype 1(14), 2(1/2), 7 and 9 were 9.6%, 8.5%, 11.3% and 29.5% respectively in 2005. While in 2006, the prevalence of Streptococcus suis was 82.5%, with capsular types 1 (14), 2 (1/2), 7 and 9 were accounted for 17.6%, 2.4%, 25.8% and 20.0% of all the specimens. All the three isolates belonged to Streptococcus suis serotype 2,named 2a, 2f and 14e, which exhibiting the virulent phenotype cps2+/gdh+/mrp-/lepf-/sly-/fbps+/orf2+/89k-, cps2+/lgdh+/mrp-/epf-/sly-/fbps-/orf2-/89k- and cps2+/gdh+/mrp-/epf-/sly-/fbps/orf2-/ respectively. These isolates were all susceptible to amoxicillin, ampicillin, penicillin and resistant to amikacin and tetraycline. Clinical signs were not noted in BALB/c mice and rabbit. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of the Streptococcus suis among the healthy herds in the areas was very high, with various capsule types of Streptococcus suis involved in the same herds, and the virulent phenotype of these 3 isolates were very different from those prevalent Streptococcus suis serotype 2 virulent isolates frequently discovered from the epidemic areas.
TI  - Identification of immunogenic cell wall-associated proteins of Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is a porcine and human pathogen with adhesive and invasive properties. The absence of suitable vaccine or virulent marker can be the bottleneck to control SS2 infection. An immunoproteome-based approach was developed to identify candidate antigens of SS2 for vaccine development. Hyperimmune sera, convalescent sera, and control sera were analyzed for reactivity by Western Blot against SS2 cell wall-associated proteins (WAPs) separated by 2-DE. A total of 34 proteins were identified by immunoproteomic analysis, of which 15 were recognized by both hyperimmune sera and convalescent sera, including most WAPs currently characterized as SS2 vaccine candidate antigens: muramidase-released protein (MRP), surface protein SP1 (Sao), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GapdH). The novel immunogenic proteins may be developed as alternative antigens for further study of SS2 vaccine and diagnostics.
TI  - Differentiation of highly virulent strains of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 according to glutamate dehydrogenase electrophoretic and sequence type.
AB  - The glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) enzymes of 19 Streptococcus suis serotype 2 strains, consisting of 18 swine isolates and 1 human clinical isolate from a geographically varied collection, were analyzed by activity staining on a nondenaturing gel. All seven (100%) of the highly virulent strains tested produced an electrophoretic type (ET) distinct from those of moderately virulent and nonvirulent strains. By PCR and nucleotide sequence determination, the gdh genes of the 19 strains and of 2 highly virulent strains involved in recent Chinese outbreaks yielded a 1,820-bp fragment containing an open reading frame of 1,344 nucleotides, which encodes a protein of 448 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of approximately 49 kDa. The nucleotide sequences contained base pair differences, but most were silent. Cluster analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences separated the isolates into three groups. Group I (ETI) consisted of the seven highly virulent isolates and the two Chinese outbreak strains, containing Ala(299)-to-Ser, Glu(305)-to-Lys, and Glu(330)-to-Lys amino acid substitutions compared with groups II and III (ETII). Groups II and III consisted of moderately virulent and nonvirulent strains, which are separated from each other by Tyr(72)-to-Asp and Thr(296)-to-Ala substitutions. Gene exchange studies resulted in the change of ETI to ETII and vice versa. A spectrophotometric activity assay for GDH did not show significant differences between the groups. These results suggest that the GDH ETs and sequence types may serve as useful markers in predicting the pathogenic behavior of strains of this serotype and that the molecular basis for the observed differences in the ETs was amino acid substitutions and not deletion, insertion, or processing uniqueness.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary crystallographic analysis of recombinant immunoglobulin G-binding protein from Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis, an important zoonotic pathogen, expresses immunoglobulin G-binding protein, which is thought to be helpful to the organism in eluding the host defence system. Recombinant IgG-binding protein expressed in Escherichia coli has been crystallized using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. The crystals belonged to space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 38.98, b = 43.94, c = 78.17 A and one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Diffraction data were collected to 2.60 A resolution.
TI  - Isolation and identification of a bacteriophage capable of infecting Streptococcus suis type 2 strains.
AB  - Streptococcus suis (S. suis) type 2 infection is considered to be a major problem worldwide in the swine industry. Studying phages of S. suis type 2 would be crucial for understanding the ecology and evolution of the Gram-positive bacteria. However, at the present, very little is known about them. An S. suis type 2 bacteriophage, named SMP, was isolated from nasal swabs of healthy Bama minipigs and was characterized at the microbiological and molecular levels. Phage SMP had an isometric head of 50 nm, a noncontractile tail of approximately 135 nm, and a linear double-stranded DNA genome. The host range of phage SMP was limited to 2 of 24 S. suis type 2 strains tested. The genome of phage SMP contained 36,216 bp with an average G+C content of 41.6%.
TI  - Streptococcus suis meningitis: the newest serious infectious disease.
AB  - The authors report 41 patients with meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis. The  clinical feature of the meningitis is characteristic with severe sensorineural hearing loss, developing early during the course of meningitis. These patients were cured with high doses of penicillin or third generation cephalosporins but the deafness remained permanent. The mechanism of the cochlear and vestibular damage is uncertain; presumably, it is caused by some oto-toxins from bacteria. The disease may become an occupational risk of pork handlers and a public health problem in Thailand.
TI  - Dexamethasone prevents alteration of tight junction-associated proteins and barrier function in porcine choroid plexus epithelial cells after infection with Streptococcus suis in vitro.
AB  - Apart from antibiotic treatment in bacterial meningitis supportive therapy including dexamethasone is widely used. In investigations on the pathogenesis of bacterial meningitis we previously demonstrated that Streptococcus suis (S. suis), a relevant cause of bacterial meningitis in pigs and humans, affects porcine choroid plexus epithelial cell (PCPEC) barrier function. The choroid plexus epithelium constitutes the structural basis of the blood-CSF barrier. Now, we investigated the role of tight junction proteins and the actin cytoskeleton of PCPEC in correlation to barrier function after S. suis infection and analyzed the influence of dexamethasone. S. suis caused massive rearrangement of the tight junction proteins ZO-1, occludin and claudin-1, caused loss of actin at the apical cell pole and induced basolateral stress fiber formation. Moreover, tight junctions were shifted from the Triton X insoluble to the Triton X soluble fraction, and additionally occludin was dephosphorylated and degraded. Infection with S. suis leads to an inflammatory response exemplified by the induction of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 gene activation, which correlated with phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERKs). Importantly, dexamethasone significantly prevented S.suis-induced protein and morphological tight junction alterations and attenuated ERK activation and MMP-3 expression. It especially improved the barrier function by preventing tight junction protein reorganization and degradation. In the pathogenesis of bacterial meningitis protection of blood-CSF barrier by dexamethasone may prevent the penetration of bacteria and leukocytes into the CSF.
TI  - Identification and characterization of novel immunogenic proteins of Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis, a zoonotic pathogen, caused serious outbreaks in humans with  high mortality rates in the past decade. To develop safer and more effective vaccines, particularly for human protection, cell wall and extracellular proteins of S. suis serotype 2 were analyzed by an immunoproteomic approach in this study. Thirty-two proteins with high immunogenicity were identified and 22 of them were newly identified. Further analyses of 9 selected proteins revealed that (1) these 9 proteins were expressed in all tested virulent S. suis serotype 2 isolates, (2) antisera against 6 of the selected proteins efficiently killed the bacteria by opsonized phagocytosis in human blood, and (3) significantly higher levels of serum antibodies against 3 proteins were detected in both patients and infected swines. Therefore, our results suggest the 3 proteins (SSU98_0197, SSU98_1094 and SSU1664) have strong potential to be vaccine candidates.
TI  - [Isolation and identification of the temperate bacteriophage from isolated strains of Streptococcus suis serotype 2].
AB  - A PCR assay was developed to study the distributional characteristics of phage integrase gene in Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2). A 323bp distinct DNA target can be amplified in 25 strains of virulent SS2, while can not be amplified in avirulent strain T15, 5 strains of other serotypes (SS1, SS7, SS9) and strains of group C Streptococcus strains from pigs, which suggested that the phage integrase gene may be related to the pathogenicity of SS2 and can be consider as a detection factor of the virulent gene of SS2. The sequencing and restriction endonuclease analysis of the PCR products were also done. Comparisons between the sequences of phage integrase gene with that of SS2 strain, showed a high homology with SS2 China strains 98HAH33, 05ZYH33 and North American strain 89-1591. Complete cell lysis was observed with SS2 virulent strains but not with avirulent strain T15 after the induction by mitomycin C. Electron microscopy analysis of the lysate from SS2 virulent strains HA9801 and ZY05719 revealed the presence of phage particles. The induced phage, named SS2-HA and SS2-ZY, both have a small isometric nucleocapsid approximately 50 nm in diameter and have no tail and is therefore a member of the Tectiviridae family. The phage integrase gene sequence of phage SS2-HA and SS2-ZY shared high homologue identities with virulent SS2 strains, which suggested that the phage integrase gene of SS2 has high specify. The temperate phage and phage integrase gene can only detected from SS2 virulent strains but not from avirulent strain, and the detection of phage integrase gene was related to the virulence-associate factors of SS2, such as the muramidase-released protein gene (mrp), which suggested that the temperate phage of SS2 may be related to the pathogenicity of SS2.
TI  - Comparison of the susceptibilities of C57BL/6 and A/J mouse strains to Streptococcus suis serotype 2 infection.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important swine and human pathogen. Assessment of susceptibility to S. suis using animal models has been limited to monitoring mortality rates. We recently developed a hematogenous model of S. suis infection in adult CD1 outbred mice to study the in vivo development of an early septic shock-like syndrome that leads to death and a late phase that clearly induces central nervous system damage, including meningitis. In the present study, we compared the severities of septic shock-like syndrome caused by S. suis between adult C57BL/6J (B6) and A/J inbred mice. Clinical parameters, proinflammatory mediators, and bacterial clearance were measured to dissect potential immune factors associated with genetic susceptibility to S. suis infection. Results showed that A/J mice were significantly more susceptible than B6 mice to S. suis infection, especially during the acute septic phase of infection (100% of A/J and 16% of B6 mice died before 24 h postinfection). The greater susceptibility of A/J mice was associated with an exaggerated inflammatory response, as indicated by their higher production of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-12p40/p70 (IL-12p40/p70), gamma interferon, and IL-1beta, but not with different bacterial loads in the blood. In addition, IL-10 was shown to be responsible, at least in part, for the higher survival in B6 mice. Our findings demonstrate that A/J mice are very susceptible to S. suis infection and provide evidence that the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators is crucial for host survival during the septic phase.
TI  - Polysaccharide capsule and suilysin contribute to extracellular survival of Streptococcus suis co-cultivated with primary porcine phagocytes.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is a major cause of meningitis, sepsis and arthritis in piglets and a zoonotic agent. Survival in the blood circulation system represents a major step in pathogenesis of S. suis infections. To get further insights into the mechanisms of S. suis survival in the host, we compared a highly virulent S. suis serotype 2 strain with its non-encapsulated and suilysin-deficient mutants in their abilities to resist phagocytosis and killing by polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and mononuclear cells. PMNs displayed a higher capacity to take up encapsulated bacteria than mononuclear cells, whereas both cell types internalized efficiently non-encapsulated S. suis. Differentiation of extracellular and intracellular survival of the WT strain revealed that in PMNs the majority of the cell-associated streptococci were intracellular, whereas in mononuclear cells the majority remained attached to the cell surface. S. suis survived mainly extracellularly, since both cells killed intracellular bacteria to a similar extent. As a consequence of different resistance to phagocytosis, only the encapsulated S. suis strains survived co-cultivation with PMNs. Comparison of the WT strain with its encapsulated suilysin-deficient mutant revealed reduced survival of the mutant after co-cultivation with PMNs. Involvement of suilysin in inhibition of phagocytosis was further confirmed by the use of anti-suilysin antibodies and recombinant suilysin. Kinetic experiments with PMNs suggested that reduced survival of the mutant strain was mainly associated with an increased uptake, whilst both strains adhered similarly. Concluding, our results indicate that the capsule and the suilysin play important roles in S. suis survival in the host by interfering with phagocytic uptake.
TI  - Streptococcus suis type 2 culture supernatant enhances the infection ability of the Swine influenza virus H3 subtype in MDCK cells.
AB  - Swine Influenza virus and Streptococcus suis type 2 often occur as a clinical coinfection in pigs, the syndrome of which is more serious than the virus or bacterium sole infection. Streptococcus suis type 2 can produce extracellular proteases, which may cleave hemagglutinin to enhance the infection ability of Swine Influenza virus. The current study investigated whether extracellular proteolytic culture supernatant of Streptococcus suis type 2, isolated from Jiangsu, enhanced the infection ability of H3N2 Swine Influenza virus (A/Swine/Guangdong/4/2003) on MDCK cells. Our data suggested that exposure of MDCK cells to culture supernatant of Streptococcus suis type 2 enhanced the cytopathic effect produced by Swine Influenza virus, hemagglutination of cell culture supernatants and FITC immunofluorescence intensity.
TI  - Comparative proteome analysis of secreted proteins of Streptococcus suis serotype 9 isolates from diseased and healthy pigs.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important swine pathogen responsible for a variety of human diseases. Investigations of virulence factors have focused on S. suis serotype 2 strains (SS2), which are the most invasive isolates worldwide. However, S. suis serotype 9 (SS9) is also a prevalent serotype. Unlike SS2, little is known about virulence factors for SS9. The two strains, GZ0565 and SH040917, were isolated from a diseased pig and a healthy pig, respectively. The virulence of these two SS9 strains was evaluated in zebrafish. The 50% lethal dose value of strain GZ0565 was 3.8x10(5)cfu/fish, while zebrafish injected with strain SH040917 exhibited no mortalities. For revealing proteins probably involved in different pathogenicity, a comparative proteomics approach was used to distinguish between the two-dimensional electrophoresis profiles of secreted proteins in two strains. With the use of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS, protein spots that were unique to strain GZ0565 were identified, and led to the identification of 13 candidate proteins. The largest proportion of these proteins was metabolism-related. Five of the proteins are putative virulence-associated factors: DNA nuclease, o-acetylserine lyase, peptidoglycan-binding LysM, phosphoglycerate mutase, and putative 5'-nucleotidase. These findings contribute to the understanding of SS9 pathogenic mechanisms.
TI  - Occurrence of antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens and indicator bacteria in pigs in different European countries from year 2002 - 2004: the ARBAO-II study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The project "Antibiotic resistance in bacteria of animal origin - II" (ARBAO-II) was funded by the European Union (FAIR5-QLK2-2002-01146) for the period 2003-05. The aim of this project was to establish a program for the continuous monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogenic and indicator bacteria from food animals using validated and harmonised methodologies. In this report the first data on the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria causing infections in pigs are reported. METHODS: Susceptibility data from 17,642 isolates of pathogens and indicator bacteria including Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Streptococcus suis and Escherichia coli isolated from pigs were collected from fifteen European countries in 2002-2004. RESULTS: Data for A. pleuropneumoniae from infected pigs were submitted from five countries. Most of the isolates from Denmark were susceptible to all drugs tested with the exceptions of a low frequency of resistance to tetracycline and trimethoprim - sulphonamide. Data for S. suis were obtained from six countries. In general, a high level of resistance to tetracycline (48.0 - 92.0%) and erythromycin (29.1 - 75.0%) was observed in all countries whereas the level of resistance to ciprofloxacin and penicillin differed between the reporting countries. Isolates from England (and Wales), France and The Netherlands were all susceptible to penicillin. In contrast the proportion of strains resistant to ciprofloxacin ranged from 12.6 to 79.0% (2004) and to penicillin from 8.1 - 13.0% (2004) in Poland and Portugal. Data for E. coli from infected and healthy pigs were obtained from eleven countries. The data reveal a high level of resistance to tetracyclines, streptomycin and ampicillin among infected pigs whereas in healthy pigs the frequency of resistance was lower. CONCLUSION: Bacterial resistance to some antimicrobials was frequent with different levels of resistance being observed to several antimicrobial agents in different countries. The occurrence of resistance varied distinctly between isolates from healthy and diseased pigs, with the isolates from healthy pigs generally showing a lower level of resistance than those from diseased pigs. The study suggests that the choice of antimicrobials used for the treatment of diseased animals should preferably be based on knowledge of the local pattern of resistance.
TI  - Changes in abundance of Lactobacillus spp. and Streptococcus suis in the stomach, jejunum and ileum of piglets after weaning.
AB  - This present study investigated the changes in bacterial community composition, with an emphasis on Lactobacillus spp. and Streptococcus suis populations as potentially beneficial and harmful groups, in the stomach, jejunum and ileum of piglets after weaning (21 days postpartum) by 16S rRNA gene-based methods. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis showed that, after weaning, predominant bands related to Lactobacillus spp. disappeared and were replaced by potential pathogenic species, such as Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Moraxella cuniculi, S. suis and Porphyromonas catoniae. Real-time PCR revealed that the abundances of lactobacilli and Lactobacillus sobrius as a proportion of total bacterial abundance were significantly lower in the stomach, jejunum and ileum of weaned piglets than in 21-day-old piglets. A specific and sensitive real-time PCR assay was developed for quantification of the important pathogen S. suis within gastrointestinal microbiota. The assay showed that S. suis predominated in the stomach samples of weaned piglets with population levels up to 10(7) copies g(-1) digesta, while it was not detected in the stomach before weaning. Streptococcus suis was not dominant in the jejunum and ileum digesta before weaning, but became dominant after weaning, with population levels up to 10(7) copies g(-1) digesta. The results demonstrated for the first time the postweaning dominance of the potentially harmful S. suis in piglet intestine. The results also suggest that the defensive barrier of the stomach can be impaired as S. suis became dominant while the proportion of Lactobacillus populations decreased after weaning, which may further result in an increase of S. suis abundance in the intestine.
TI  - Structural basis of the zinc- and terbium-mediated inhibition of ferroxidase activity in Dps ferritin-like proteins.
AB  - Streptococcus suis Dpr is an iron-binding protein involved in oxidative stress resistance. It belongs to the bacterial Dps protein family whose members form dodecameric assemblies. Previous studies have shown that zinc and terbium inhibit iron incorporation in Listeria innocua Dps protein. In order to gain structural insights into the inhibitory effect of zinc and terbium, the crystal structures of Streptococcus suis Dpr complexes with these ions were determined at 1.8 A and 2.1 A, respectively. Both ions were found to bind at the ferroxidase center and in the same location as iron. In addition, a novel zinc-binding site formed by His40 and His44 was identified. Both His residues were found to be present within all known Streptococcus suis Dpr variants and in Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus gordonii, and Streptococcus sanguinis Dpr proteins. Amino acid sequence alignment of Dpr with other Dps family members revealed that His44 is highly conserved, in contrast to His40. The inhibitory effect of zinc and terbium on iron oxidation in Dpr was studied in vitro, and it was found that both ions at concentrations >0.2 mM almost completely abolish iron binding. These results provide a structural basis for the inhibitory effect of zinc and terbium in the Dps family of proteins, and suggest a potential role of the Dps proteins in zinc detoxification mechanisms involving the second zinc-binding site.
TI  - Fibrinogen induces biofilm formation by Streptococcus suis and enhances its antibiotic resistance.
AB  - In this study, we showed that supplementing the culture medium with fibrinogen induced biofilm formation by Streptococcus suis in a dose-dependent manner. Biofilm-grown S. suis cells were much more resistant to penicillin G than planktonic cells. S. suis bound fibrinogen to its surface, a property that likely contributes to biofilm formation.
TI  - Streptococcus suis meningitis in the Netherlands.
AB  - We present four patients with Streptococcus suis meningitis identified during a 3.5-year prospective surveillance study in the Netherlands. All cases were associated with exposure to pigs. Patients presented with classic symptoms and signs of bacterial meningitis. Outcome was characterized by severe hearing loss. Physicians should be aware of occupational exposure with S. suis and risk of meningitis associated with this pathogen.

AB  
TI  - Prevalence of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Actinobacillus suis, Haemophilus parasuis, Pasteurella multocida, and Streptococcus suis in representative Ontario swine herds.
AB  - Tonsillar and nasal swabs were collected from weanling pigs in 50 representative  Ontario swine herds and tested for the presence of 5 important bacterial upper respiratory tract pathogens. All but 1 herd (2%) tested positive for Streptococcus suis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR); 48% of herds were S. suis serovar 2, 1/2 positive. In all but 2 herds there was evidence of Haemophilus parasuis infection. In contrast, toxigenic strains of Pasteurella multocida were detected by a P. multocida--enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (PMT-ELISA) in only one herd. Seventy-eight percent of the herds were diagnosed positive for Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae by apxIV PCR. Sera from finishing pigs on the same farms were also collected and tested by ELISA for the presence of A. pleuropneumoniae antibodies. Seventy percent of the herds tested had evidence of antibodies to A. pleuropneumoniae including serovars 1-9-11 (2%), 2 (4%), 3-6-8-15 (15%), 5 (6%), 4-7 (26%), and 12 (17%). This likely represents a shift from previous years when infection with A. pleuropneumoniae serovars 1, 5, and 7 predominated. At least 16% and possibly as many as 94% of the herds tested were Actinobacillus suis positive; only 3 of the 50 herds were both A. pleuropneumoniae and A. suis negative as judged by the absence of a positive PCR test for apxII. Taken together, these data suggest that over the past 10 years, there has been a shift in the presence of pathogenic bacteria carried by healthy Ontario swine with the virtual elimination of toxigenic strains of P. multocida and a move to less virulent A. pleuropneumoniae serovars. As well, there appears to be an increase in prevalence of S. suis serovar 2, 1/2, but this may be a reflection of the use of a more sensitive detection method.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of Streptococcus suis strains isolated from clinically healthy sows in China.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important pathogen in the swine industry. Because transmission is generally thought to occur between healthy carrier sows and their offspring, it is important to understand which antimicrobial agents are likely to be effective against the strains isolated. This study is the first to report on the antimicrobial susceptibility of S. suis isolated from clinical healthy sows. From 2005 to 2007 a total of 421 S. suis isolates were recovered from sows in China and subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing in accordance with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) standards. High-level resistance were found with tetracycline (91.7%) and sulfisoxazole (86.7%), followed by clindamycin (68.4%), erythromycin (67.2%), tilmicosin (66.7%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (59.1%). These six antimicrobial agents presented the highest MIC50 values and the antibiogram (19.2%) most frequently observed. Lower resistance rates among the beta-Lactams support their use as the primary drugs to treat the infection of S. suis. However, appropriate dosing or combination antibiotic therapeutic regimens should be adhered to in view of the resistant and intermediate strains to penicillin (9.5% and 42.3%), ampicillin (4.0% and 29.9%) and ceftiofur (22.1% and 37.3%), respectively.
TI  - [Study on expression of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 sly gene, purification and  activity of its product].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To clone and express Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S. suis 2) sly gene for constructing an foundation on identification of S. suis 2 protective antigen. METHODS: The sly gene was amplified from S. suis 2 clinical isolate strain 05ZYH33 genome DNA by PCR. The gene fragment was inserted into the expression vector pET-30b(+) to build pET30b-sly. When recombinant vector pET30b-sly was identified by restriction enzyme cutting and DNA sequencing as a correct one, subsequently it was transformed to E. coli Rosetta for expression under IPTG induction. The obtained fusion protein was purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The immunologic and hemolysis activity of the purified protein was proved through Western blot and hemolysis assay respectively. RESULTS: The PCR product was around 1500 bp. The gene segment inserted into the recombinant vector was proven to be completely identical with the sly gene sequence in the total genome sequence of S. suis 2. The target protein expressed was up to 30% of the total somatic protein under IPTG induction. The protein purity reached above 80% after purification. The protein could be recognized by human serum infected with S. suis 2 and could dissolve swine erythrocytes with the Hemolytic titer as 256. CONCLUSION: The expression vector pET30b-sly was successfully constructed. The target protein could be over-expressed in E. coli and possessed its biological activity after purification.
TI  - D-alanylation of lipoteichoic acid contributes to the virulence of Streptococcus  suis.
AB  - We generated by allelic replacement a DeltadltA mutant of a virulent Streptococcus suis serotype 2 field strain and evaluated the contribution of lipoteichoic acid (LTA) d-alanylation to the virulence traits of this swine pathogen and zoonotic agent. The absence of LTA D-alanylation resulted in increased susceptibility to the action of cationic antimicrobial peptides. In addition, and in contrast to the wild-type strain, the DeltadltA mutant was efficiently killed by porcine neutrophils and showed diminished adherence to and invasion of porcine brain microvascular endothelial cells. Finally, the DeltadltA mutant was attenuated in both the CD1 mouse and porcine models of infection, probably reflecting a decreased ability to escape immune clearance mechanisms and an impaired capacity to move across host barriers. The results of this study suggest that LTA D-alanylation is an important factor in S. suis virulence.
TI  - SalK/SalR, a two-component signal transduction system, is essential for full virulence of highly invasive Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S. suis 2, SS2) has evolved into a highly infectious entity, which caused the two recent large-scale outbreaks of human SS2 epidemic in China, and is characterized by a toxic shock-like syndrome. However, the molecular pathogenesis of this new emerging pathogen is still poorly understood. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 89K is a newly predicted pathogenicity island (PAI) which is specific to Chinese epidemic strains isolated from these two SS2 outbreaks. Further bioinformatics analysis revealed a unique two-component signal transduction system (TCSTS) located in the candidate 89K PAI, which is orthologous to the SalK/SalR regulatory system of Streptococcus salivarius. Knockout of salKR eliminated the lethality of SS2 in experimental infection of piglets. Functional complementation of salKR into the isogenic mutant DeltasalKR restored its soaring pathogenicity. Colonization experiments showed that the DeltasalKR mutant could not colonize any susceptible tissue of piglets when administered alone. Bactericidal assays demonstrated that resistance of the mutant to polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN)-mediated killing was greatly decreased. Expression microarray analysis exhibited a transcription profile alteration of 26 various genes down-regulated in the DeltasalKR mutant. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings suggest that SalK/SalR is requisite for the full virulence of ethnic Chinese isolates of highly pathogenic SS2, thus providing experimental evidence for the validity of this bioinformatically predicted PAI.
TI  - Predominant bacteria recovered from a periodontitis site in a hamster model raised by silk-ligature with Porphyromonas gingivalis infection.
AB  - We isolated oral bacteria that coexisted with Porphyromonas gingivalis in a hamster periodontitis model. As predominant bacteria in the periodontitis site, Collinsella-reltaed strains, Eubacterium-reltaed strains, Streptococcus suis-related strains, and Veillonella parvula-reltaed strains were detected. In addition, Actinomyces, Bacteroides, and P. gingivalis were also isolated predominantly. The results suggest that the bacterial composition of the periodontitis site in hamsters is complex, as in human periodontitis.
TI  - An Australian case of Streptococcus suis toxic shock syndrome associated with occupational exposure to animal carcasses.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is known to cause sporadic infections in people who have occupational exposure to pigs and pig meat. A large outbreak occurred in China in 2005, where there was 62% mortality among those who developed toxic shock syndrome. Despite S. suis being common in pigs, this is the first published report of a human case of S. suis toxic shock syndrome in Australia.
TI  - Spread of Streptococcus suis sequence type 7, China.
AB  - Streptococcus suis sequence type (ST) 7 has been spreading throughout China. To determine events associated with its emergence, we tested 114 isolates. In all 106 ST7 strains responsible for human outbreaks and sporadic infections, the tetracycline-resistance gene, tetM, was detected on the conjugative transposon Tn916. Horizontal transmission of tetM is suspected.

TI  - Additions of killed whole cell bacteria preparations to Freund complete adjuvant  alter laying hen antibody response to soluble protein antigen.
AB  - Passive transfer of antibodies from hen to egg has value to both the producer of  commercial polyclonal egg antibody and the producer of hatching eggs. Water-in-oil emulsions are commonly amended with immune stimulants such as Mycobacteria (e.g., Freund complete adjuvant; FCA) to increase antibody production to soluble protein antigens (SPA). Recent discoveries of the mechanisms by which microbial products act as adjuvants led us to hypothesize that additions of killed whole cell bacteria (bacterins) to FCA could improve antibody responses to SPA. All injections used in each experiment were water-in-oil emulsions (50:50) containing 3 mg/mL of phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) immunogen. Additionally, all primary control and treatment injections contained heat-killed Mycobacterium butyricum immunogens from FCA. In addition to PLA(2) and FCA, primary treatment injections contained various microbial bacterin immunogens. Hence, the experimental treatment of all experiments was addition of a commercial source of microbial bacterin to FCA for the primary injection only. Booster injections were the same as the primary control injections except Freund incomplete adjuvant replaced FCA. Anti-body titers to PLA(2) in yolk were determined by ELISA. Bacterins tested as additives to FCA were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus suis, and Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis. Escherichia coli bacterin added to FCA decreased egg yolk antibody titer to SPA by 23% in hens of different ages and strains (P < 0.0001). In a second experiment, a 51% decrease in antibody production associated with E. coli bacterin was sustained for several weeks after the primary immunization (P = 0.003). Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus suis combined with FCA increased egg yolk antibody 62 and 51%, respectively (P < 0.05), and Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis had no effect. In conclusion, the addition of bacterin to FCA can influence hen antibody response to SPA as measured in egg yolks. It is hypothesized that the difference in antibody production may be related to the composition of various pathogen associated molecular patterns in the primary injection.
TI  - Bacterial infections in pigs experimentally infected with Nipah virus.
AB  - Nipah virus (NiV; Paramyxoviridae) caused fatal encephalitis in humans during an  outbreak in Malaysia in 1998/1999 after transmission from infected pigs. Our previous study demonstrated that the respiratory, lymphatic and central nervous systems are targets for virus replication in experimentally infected pigs. To continue the studies on pathogenesis of NiV in swine, six piglets were inoculated oronasally with 2.5 x 10(5) PFU per animal. Four pigs developed mild clinical signs, one exudative epidermitis, and one neurologic signs due to suppurative meningoencephalitis, and was euthanized at 11 days post-inoculation (dpi). Neutralizing antibodies reached in surviving animals titers around 1280 at 16 dpi. Nasal and oro-pharyngeal shedding of the NiV was detected between 2 and 17 dpi. Virus appeared to be cleared from the tissues of the infected animals by 23 dpi, with low amount of RNA detected in submandibular and bronchial lymph nodes of three pigs, and olfactory bulb of one animal. Despite the presence of neutralizing antibodies, virus was isolated from serum at 24 dpi, and the viral RNA was still detected in serum at 29 dpi. Our results indicate slower clearance of NiV from some of the infected pigs. Bacteria were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of five NiV inoculated animals, with isolation of Streptococcus suis and Enterococcus faecalis. Staphylococcus hyicus was isolated from the skin lesions of the animal with exudative epidermitis. Along with the observed lymphoid depletion in the lymph nodes of all NiV-infected animals, and the demonstrated ability of NiV to infect porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro, this finding warrants further investigation into a possible NiV-induced immunosuppression of the swine host.
TI  - Cloning, expression and characterization of a cell wall surface protein, 6-phosphogluconate-dehydrogenase, of Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis type 2 is a pathogen responsible for diverse diseases in both  pigs and humans. In order to understand the pathogenesis of the S. suis type 2 infection, the gene encoding a cell surface protein, 6-phosphogluconate-dehydrogenase (6PGD) of S. suis type 2 was cloned and sequenced, and recombinant 6PGD protein (r6PGD) was produced in a prokaryotic expression system. Sequence analysis of the cloned 6 pdg gene showed 82% similarity with Streptococcus pneumoniae 6 pdg at the nucleic acid level. Western blotting using r6PGD-specific antiserum confirmed the cell surface location of the 6PGD protein of S. suis type 2. The role of 6PGD in S. suis type 2 pathogenesis as an adhesin and its immunogenicity in mice was further investigated. The results showed that the recombinant protein interfered with the adhesion of S. suis type 2 to Hep2 and HeLa cells by 72% and 66%, respectively. Immunization of CD-1 mice with r6PGD increased the protective efficacy by 80% following intraperitoneal administration of a lethal dose of S. suis type 2. Immunization of CD-1 mice with r6PGD elicited a significant protective immune response, which demonstrated the importance of 6PGD to bacterial pathogenesis. Identification and characterization of the role of S. suis type 2 6PGD in adhesion and immunogenicity will allow us to use this protein to develop new antimicrobial therapies and/or vaccines.
TI  - Synthesis of multivalent Streptococcus suis adhesion inhibitors by enzymatic cleavage of polygalacturonic acid and 'click' conjugation.
AB  - A galabiose disaccharide building block was synthesized by an efficient pectinase cleavage of polygalacturonic acid and subsequent chemical functional group transformations. Besides the disaccharide, the corresponding trisaccharide was also obtained and modified. The compounds were subsequently conjugated to dendrimers with up to eight end groups using 'click' chemistry. The compounds were evaluated as inhibitors of adhesion of the pathogen Streptococcus suis in a hemagglutination assay and strong inhibition was observed for the tetra- and octavalent galabiose compound with MIC values in the low nanomolar range. The corresponding octavalent trisaccharide was a ca. 20-fold weaker inhibitor.

TI  - Immunoproteomic assay of surface proteins of Streptococcus suis serotype 9.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important swine pathogen responsible for a diverse group of diseases. Studies on vaccines have focused on S. suis serotype 2 strains, which are the most invasive isolates worldwide. However, in China S. suis serotype 9 (SS9) is also a prevalent serotype, which is frequently isolated from diseased pigs. Little is known about immunogenic proteins for SS9. Therefore, an immunoproteomic-based approach was developed to identify immunogenic proteins of SS9. Cell wall proteins extracted from SS9 strain GZ0565 isolated from a diseased pig with meningitis were screened by two-dimensional Western blotting using anti-SS9 sera pooled from specific pathogen-free mice. Protein spots were excised from preparative gels and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight MS (MALDI-TOF-MS) or MALDI-TOF-TOF-MS, which led to the identification of eight immunogenic proteins (arginine deiminase, extracellular solute-binding protein, translation elongation factor Ts, neprilysin, peptide ATP-binding cassette transporter peptide-binding protein, pyruvate kinase, phosphate acetyltransferase, and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase). These immunogenic proteins, which are encoded by genes that are reasonably conserved among SS9 strains, could be developed as vaccine candidates.
TI  - Streptococcus suis: meningitis, spondylodiscitis and bacteraemia with a serotype  14 strain.
AB  - Meningitis and spondylodiscitis caused by Streptococcus suis is a rare disease which is contracted by occupational exposure to pigs. We report a 54-y-old pig-farm worker with S. suis meningitis and septicaemia complicated with thoracal and lumbar spine spondylodiscitis. The S. suis strain involved in this case report was identified as serotype 14, which has only been described in 2 previous cases. It is important to report infection with S. suis as a work accident for compensation if the patient has been occupationally exposed to pigs.
TI  - Allelic variation and prevalence of serum opacity factor among the Streptococcus  suis population.
AB  - Serum opacity factor of Streptococcus suis (OFS) has recently been identified as  a virulence determinant of an S. suis strain. In this study, we investigated the prevalence and variations of the ofs gene among 108 S. suis isolates from diseased and healthy pigs, and human patients. PCR screening and sequencing analysis showed that besides the ofs gene reported already (designated type 1), there were three allelic variants of ofs (designated types 2 to 4). Type-1 and type-2 ofs genes were expected to encode functional OFS, and SDS extracts of the isolates with type-1 ofs and type-2 ofs opacified horse serum. Culture supernatants of the isolates with type-2 ofs also showed strong serum opacification activity. In contrast, type-3 ofs was interrupted by a point mutation and type-4 ofs was disrupted by either insertion of an IS element or genetic rearrangement, and therefore the SDS extracts and culture supernatants of the isolates with type-3 ofs and type-4 ofs did not show serum opacification activity. Regardless of their origins, approximately 30 % of the isolates possessed functional OFSs, although type-2 ofs was found only in three isolates from healthy pigs. Multilocus sequence typing analysis showed that most of the isolates with type-1 ofs belonged to the sequence type (ST)1 complex, and most of the isolates with type-3 ofs and type-4 ofs belonged to the ST27 complex. The isolates with type-2 ofs were not assigned to a major ST complex. These results suggest that type-1 OFS contributes to the virulence of a limited number of S. suis isolates, i.e. those of the ST1 complex type, whereas other S. suis may not possess this category of virulence factor; the importance of type-2 OFS is obscure.
TI  - [Antibiotics susceptibility of Streptococcus and Enterococcus: data of Onerba network].
AB  - This work was aimed to analyze trends in susceptibility to antibiotics among the  main species of beta-hemolytic streptococci involved in community-acquired infections in human (Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae), or in animals (Streptococcus suis and Streptococcus uberis) and also among the main enterocci species, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. Data were recorded since 1996 through the Onerba networks. S. pyogenes, as the other beta-hemolytic streptococci studied remained fully susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics. However, susceptibility to macrolides is clearly decreasing in S. pyogenes. In 2002, only 62 to 65% of the strains according to the network considered, were susceptible to erythromycin. A similar trend was observed for S. agalactiae with only 75% of erythromycin susceptibility in 2002, and for both species isolated from animals S. suis and S. uberis, with respectively 35 and 76% of strains susceptible to erythromycin. In enterococci, susceptibility to beta-lactams remained stable between 2000 and 2004. Indeed, the susceptibility to aminopenicillins remained high in E. faecalis (about 98%), whereas the proportion of E. faecium isolates susceptible to these antibiotics were lower than 60%. From 1999 to 2004, various studies conducted in French hospitals showed that the vancomycin resistance among enterococci accounted for less than 2%. However, the recent emergence of glycopeptide resistant enterococci clusters in French hospitals is a matter of concern and emphasizes the need for an ongoing surveillance. Such trend in macrolide resistance among S. pyogenes or S. agalactiae should consequently lead to propose other alternatives in case of beta-lactam allergy, and for pharyngitis, to rethink the place of the culture for susceptibility testing.

AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is an economically important, zoonotic agent  causing death and disease in both human and swine. According to published SS2 European strain P1/7 complete genomic sequence, primers for detection and amplification autolysin were designed. Autolysin gene was detected by PCR with genomic DNA of HA9801 (Jiangsu isolate), ZY05719 (Sichuan isolate), ATCC43765 (reference strain), other SS2 isolates from different regions, and strains of other different serotypes (such as serotype 1, 1/2, 7 and 9). PCR results showed that all 27 SS2 virulent isolates harbored gene autolysin, but not in non-virulent SS2 strain. Among other serotypes, only serotype 7 strain had this gene. The complete autolysin genes of HA9801 and ZY05719 were respectively amplified by PCR and sequenced. Their putative protein sequences were analyzed through online software, results showed both had six repeated domain "GBS_Bsp-like" and one domain "N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase". In addition, sequence similarity analysis demonstrated that autolysins of the two strains (HA9801 and ZY05719) showed high homologue to that of European strain P1/7 (99.8%), but obviously differed from Canada strain 89/1589, the latter lacked one domain "GBS Bsp-like". Software DNASTAR was used to analyze autolysin protein sequence and predicted its putative antigenicity. Then partial antigentic segment of autolysin was amplified, cloned and inserted into expression vector pET30a(+), and induced by IPTG to express recombinant autolysin. Its reactivity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blot with swine convalescent sera, blot result showed that the recombinant protein had good reactivity and could be considered as a vaccine candidate.
TI  - Streptococcus suis meningitis in adults in Vietnam.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus suis infection is an emerging zoonosis in Asia. We determined the detailed epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological characteristics of S. suis meningitis in adults. METHODS: We prospectively studied 450 patients with suspected bacterial meningitis. Four hundred thirty-five (96.7%) of the patients participated in a trial to determine the effect of adjunctive dexamethasone treatment. For patients with S. suis infection, bacterial DNA load at hospital admission and during treatment was analyzed in cerebrospinal fluid specimens using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. S. suis strains were characterized using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing. Putative virulence factors, including extracellular protein factor, suilysin, and muramidase released protein, were detected using polymerase chain reaction and Western blot assay. Predictors of outcome were identified using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: S. suis was the most common pathogen and was detected in 151 (33.6%) of the patients. Fifty (33.1%) of these 151 patients reported exposure to pigs or pork. Mortality was low (2.6%; 4 of 151 patients died), but mild to severe hearing loss occurred in 93 (66.4%) of 140 patients. Severe deafness at hospital discharge was associated with age >50 years (odds ratio, 3.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-11.6), a strain carrying the epf gene (odds ratio, 3.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-11.4), and dexamethasone therapy (odds ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.06-0.78) but was not associated with cerebrospinal fluid bacterial DNA load. Bacterial DNA was still detectable in 58 (63%) of 92 cerebrospinal fluid samples after 6-10 days of antimicrobial treatment. Ninety-one of 92 S. suis strains had serotype 2. Thirty-three (36%) of these epidemiologically unrelated strains belonged to 1 pulsed-field gel electrophoresis cluster of multilocus sequence type 1, indicating clonal spread. CONCLUSION: S. suis serotype 2 is the most frequent cause of bacterial meningitis in adults in southern Vietnam and is associated with substantial morbidity attributable to hearing loss.
TI  - 16S ribosomal RNA-based methods to monitor changes in the hindgut bacterial community of piglets after oral administration of Lactobacillus sobrius S1.
AB  - 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene based PCR/denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and real-time PCR were used to monitor the changes in the composition of microbiota in the hindgut of piglets after oral administration of Lactobacillus sobrius S1. Six litters of neonatal piglets were divided randomly into control group and treatment group. At 7, 9, and 11 days of age, piglets in the treatment group orally received a preparation of L. sobrius S1. At 7, 14, 21(weaning), 24, and 35 days of age, one piglet from each litter was sacrificed and digesta samples of hindgut were collected. DGGE analysis of 16S rRNA gene V6-V8 region for all bacteria showed that several populations present in the hindgut of piglets, represented by far-migrating bands, disappeared after weaning. Most of these bands corresponded to Lactobacillus spp. as revealed by sequence analysis. Quantitative real-time PCR specific for lactobacilli further demonstrated that the number of lactobacilli population tended to decrease after the piglets were weaned. Drastic changes of L. amylovorus and L. sobrius in total Lactobacillus populations were also observed in the colon of piglets around weaning, as monitored by 16S rRNA gene V2-V3 region based Lactobacillus-specific PCR-DGGE. Species-specific real-time PCR also revealed that the population of L. sobrius declined apparently in the colon of piglets after weaning. No remarkable changes in the overall microbial community in the hindgut were found between control and treatment groups. However, comparison of DGGE profiles between the two groups revealed a specific band related to Clostridium disporicum that was found in treatment group on day 14. On day 35, a specific band appeared only in the control group, representing a population most closely related to Streptococcus suis (99%). Real-time PCR showed that L. sobrius 16S rRNA gene copies in treatment group were relatively higher than in the control group (10(8.45) vs. 10(6.83)) on day 35, but no significant difference was observed between the two groups.
TI  - [Identification and characterization of a novel antigenic protein of Streptococcus suis type 2].
AB  - An immunogenic protein, named HM3, of Streptococcus suis type 2 HA9801 was identified by using immunoproteomic assay. Some characters of this protein were analyzed by several online bioinformatical tools, including BLAST, SinglP, HMMTOP and PSORTb. The most homologous sequence of HM3 was extracellular solute-binding protein (gi/69246104) of Enterococcus faecium. The predictions results showed that HM3 contained Signal peptide and one transmembrane region, and Non-Cytoplasmic Localization were also predicted. Partial gene of this protein were amplified from the genome of HA9801 by PCR and inserted into expression plasmid pET-32a (+) after double digested by BamH I and Sal I, then transformed into BL21 (DE3) where they were induced to express by IPTG. After induced, there was specific proteins band of approximately 45kDa on the SDS-PAGE gel. Western-blotting showed that recombinant protein could react with immune serum of HA9801 of SPF (Specefic pathogen Free) mini-swine. This protein could be taken as vaccine candidate of SS2.
TI  - Evaluation of pyelonephritis in culled indoor and outdoor high parity sows.
AB  - The present trial was conducted in Hungary in neighboring large indoor and outdoor pig production units, belonging to the same breeding company. Rejected kidneys from 201 (out of 241; 83.4%) outdoor, and 191 (out of 512, 37.3%) indoor high parity sows, with previous history of recidiving postparturient fever and excessive postparturient vulvovaginal discharge were gross pathologically bacteriologically, and histologically evaluated. All rejected kidneys revealed chronic pyelonephritis. In outdoor sows Escherichia (E.) coli and Actinobaculum (A.) suis were cultured from all kidneys. Besides E. coli and A. suis, Clostridium spp., Arcanobacterium pyogenes, gram-positive streptococci (enterococci, Streptococcus faecalis), staphylococci (Staphylococcus (S.) albus, S. epidermis, S. aureus), Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, and Klebsiella spp. were concurrently found in 131 (64.7%) kidneys; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter, Pasteurella multocida, Proteus spp. were concurrently found beside E. coli and A. suis in 71 (35.3%) kidneys. In indoor sows E. coli and A. suis were cultured from all kidneys as well. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter, Pasteurella multocida, Proteus spp. were found beside E. coli and A. suis in 21 (11%) kidneys. However only 6 sows (3.1%) revealed the concurrent presence of Clostridium spp., Arcanobacterium pyogenes, gram-positive streptococci (enterococci, Streptococcus faecalis), staphylococci (S. albus, S. epidermis, S. aureus), Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, and Klebsiella spp. IMPLICATIONS: in Eastern European climate, more high parity outdoor sows with recidiving postparturient fever and vulvovaginal discharge have pyelonephritis and higher diversity of pathogenic bacteria in the renal pelvis compared with indoor sows.

AB  - We conducted a 31-month retrospective review of all laboratory-confirmed Streptococcus suis infections admitted to public hospitals in Hong Kong. Strain identification, serotyping and antibiotic susceptibility tests were conducted on S. suis isolates. Twenty-one sporadic cases were identified, comprising 18 (86%) males and 3 (14%) females. About half were patients aged 65 years. More cases occurred during summer. Occupational exposure was documented in five (24%) cases. The estimated annual incidence was 0.09/100 000 in the general population and 32/100 000 in people with occupational exposure to pigs and raw pork. The primary clinical manifestations were meningitis (48%), septicaemia (38%) and endocarditis (14%). The case-fatality rate was 5%. All available isolates from 15 patients were serotype 2, sensitive to penicillin, ampicillin, ceftriaxone, but resistant to tetracycline. Injury prevention and proper handling of pigs or raw pork should be advocated to both at-risk occupational groups and the general population.
TI  - Transmission of pathogenic respiratory bacteria to specific pathogen free pigs at slaughter.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the transmission of pathogenic respiratory bacteria to thirteen 5-month-old specific pathogen free (SPF) pigs, during the slaughtering process in a commercial slaughterhouse. Before transportation, the SPF pigs and the lorry were checked to confirm the absence of pathogenic respiratory bacteria. Nine SPF pigs (group 1) were in contact in a conventional slaughterhouse with finishing pigs, during 4h before slaughtering. Four SPF pigs (group 2) were slaughtered immediately at arrival in the slaughterhouse. Five bacterial pathogens (Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus parasuis and Streptococcus suis) were detected by PCR, after slaughtering, from nasal cavities, tonsils and trachea in the two groups of pigs. Lung samples were PCR negative. Three and four bacterial species were isolated from the pigs of group 2 and group 1, respectively. Cultures were negative from the lungs. All the bacterial species present in the SPF pigs were detected by PCR. P. multocida was isolated, from three samples of scalding water before the onset of slaughtering. Our results suggest that the SPF pigs became contaminated mainly by the slaughterhouse environment and the scalding water. Histological examinations revealed that during scalding, contaminated water could reach the trachea and the lungs of pigs. Checks conducted at slaughter for respiratory disorders have to be carried on, but nasal cavities and tonsils are not appropriate for bacteriological investigations. Moreover, bacteriological results obtained from the lungs of slaughtered pigs have to be used with carefulness.
TI  - Expression and characterization of recombinant gallinacin-9 and gallinacin-8 in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Gallinacins (Gal) are antimicrobial peptides that play significant roles in innate immunity in chickens. Two Gal genes--Gal-8 and Gal-9--were cloned and sequenced from chicken liver and tongue, respectively, by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In addition, the mRNA expression of these genes has been demonstrated across a panel of chicken tissues. It was demonstrated that Gal-9 mRNA was highly expressed in the tongue and small intestine and moderately expressed in the chicken proventriculus, lung, liver, heart, spleen, and thymus. However, Gal-8 mRNA was highly expressed in the chick small intestine and liver, and moderately expressed in the chick tongue, and lung. The recombinant fusion proteins containing Gal-9 or Gal-9 and Gal-8, namely rGal-9 and rGal-9-Gal-8, were produced and purified, respectively. Both rGal-9 and rGal-9-Gal-8 were expressed as insoluble bodies and exhibited the expected antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and pathogenic Streptococci suis CAB strain, as determined by the measurement of the inhibition zone and a liquid growth inhibition assay.
TI  - Enhancement of immunity and resistance in mice by pig IL-6 gene and CpG motifs encapsulated in chitosan nanoparticle.
AB  - This study was conducted to explore the synergetic effect of a novel plasmid containing a porcine IL-6 gene and CpG motifs on immunity of mice in order to develop an effective adjuvant to boost resistance against infection. The synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide containing 11 CpG motifs was inserted into the reconstructed VR1020 plasmid containing the pig IL-6 gene (VRPIL6), designated VRIL6C, and then encapsulated in chitosan nanoparticles (CNP) prepared by ionic cross linkage, designated VRIL6C-CNP. The 3-week old mice were injected, respectively, with VRIL6C-CNP, VRIL6-CNP, CpG-CNP and VR1020-CNP to detect the changes of immunity. At 28 days post inoculation, the mice were challenged with virulent hemolytic serotype 2 Streptococcus to test their resistance against infection. The results showed that there was a significant increase in immunoglobulins and interleukins in mice receiving VRIL6C-CNP compared with the control groups, as well as an increase in the lymphocytes and monocytes in the inoculated mice, so that the immunity was remarkably improved in the VRIL6C-CNP group. The challenge provoked stronger immunity and protection against infection in the VRIL6C-CNP group than in the control mice that manifested severe symptoms and lesions. This suggests that VRIL6C-CNP could remarkably enhance the nonspecific immunity of mice, and facilitate the development of an effective immunopotentiator to promote the resistance of the animals against infection.
TI  - Analysis of the protective capacity of three Streptococcus suis proteins induced  under divalent-cation-limited conditions.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is a gram-positive pathogen that causes serious diseases in pigs and, in some cases, humans. Three genes of the virulent S. suis 89/1591 strain, encoding putative divalent-cation-binding lipoproteins, were isolated based on information obtained from the draft annotation files of this organism's genome. The products of these genes, which are inducible by divalent-cation deprivation, were subsequently purified, and their immunogenic and protective abilities were analyzed. All three proteins (SsuiDRAFT 0103, SsuiDRAFT 0174, and SsuiDRAFT 1237) were found to be immunogenic, but only one of them (SsuiDRAFT 0103) induced a significant protective response (87.5%, P = 0.01) against the same S. suis strain. Furthermore, the S. suis ssuiDRAFT 1240 gene (adcR), which encodes a predicted regulator of Zn2+ and/or Mn2+ uptake in streptococci, was cloned, and its protein product was purified. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with purified S. suis AdcR protein showed experimentally, for the first time, that the AdcR DNA-binding sequence corresponds to the TTAACNRGTTAA motif. In addition, a requirement for either Zn2+ or Mn2+, but not Fe2+, to establish in vitro binding of AdcR to its target sequence and the ability of AdcR to bind the ssuiDRAFT 0103 and ssuiDRAFT 1237 gene promoters but not the promoter of the ssuiDRAFT 0174 gene were demonstrated. Taken together, these data suggest that SsuiDRAFT 0103 is a good candidate for vaccines against S. suis and support preliminary results indicating that bacterial envelope proteins involved in the uptake of divalent cations other than iron may be useful for protective purposes.
TI  - Comparative analysis of whole genome structure of Streptococcus suis using whole  genome PCR scanning.
AB  - An outbreak associated with Streptococcus suis infection in humans emerged in Sichuan province, China in 2005. The outbreak is atypical for the apparent large number of human cases, high fatality rate and geographical spread. To determine whether the bacterium has changed, we compared both human and animal isolates from the Sichuan outbreak with those collected previously within China and in other countries using whole genome PCR scanning (WGPScaning) comparative sequencing of several known virulence factor genes and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis. WGPScanning analysis showed that all primer pairs yielded PCR products of the expected sizes in all four strains tested. The nucleotide sequences of all the detected virulence factor genes are identical in the four strains and MLST results showed that the four isolates studied and reference strain all belonged to the ST1 complex. No new genetic changes were found in the genome structure of the isolates from this Sichuan outbreak.
TI  - Streptococcus henryi sp. nov. and Streptococcus caballi sp. nov., isolated from the hindgut of horses with oligofructose-induced laminitis.
AB  - Four Gram-positive, catalase-negative, coccoid-shaped isolates were obtained from the caecum and rectum of horses with oligofructose-induced equine laminitis. Phenotypic and phylogenetic studies were performed on these isolates. Initial biochemical profiling assigned two of the isolates to Streptococcus bovis. The other two isolates, however, could not be assigned conclusively on the basis of their biochemical profiles. Gene sequence analysis demonstrated that the four new isolates were related most closely to Streptococcus suis based on the 16S rRNA gene and to Streptococcus orisratti based on the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase gene (sodA). Sequence divergence values from recognized Streptococcus species based on these two genes were >3 and >13%, respectively, for all four isolates. Phylogenetic and phenotypic analyses demonstrated that the four isolates formed two distinct clonal groups that are suggested to represent two novel species of the genus Streptococcus. The names proposed for these organisms are Streptococcus henryi sp. nov. (type strain 126(T) =ATCC BAA-1484(T) =DSM 19005(T)) and Streptococcus caballi sp. nov. (type strain 151(T) =ATCC BAA-1485(T) =DSM 19004(T)).
TI  - Proteome analysis of Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Outbreaks in humans, caused by Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2), were reported in 1998 and 2005 in China. However, the mechanism of SS2-associated infection remains unclear. For the first time, a 2-D gel approach combined with MS was used to establish a comprehensive 2-D reference map for aiding our understanding of the pathogenicity of SS2. The identification of 694 out of 834 processed spots revealed 373 proteins. Most of the identified proteins were located in the cytoplasm and were involved in energy metabolism, protein synthesis, and cellular processes. Proteins that were abundant in the 2-DE gels could be linked mainly to housekeeping functions in carbohydrate metabolism, protein quality control and translation. 2-DE of secretory proteins was performed using IPG strips of pH 4-7. Among the 102 protein spots processed, 87 spots representing 77 proteins were successfully identified. Some virulence-associated proteins of SS2 were found, including arginine deiminase, ornithine carbamoyl-transferase, carbamate kinase, muramidase-released protein precursor, extracellular factor, and suilysin. Enolase and endopeptidase have been proposed as putative virulence-associated factors in this study. The 2-D reference map might provide a powerful tool for analyzing the virulence factor and the regulatory network involved in the pathogenicity of this microorganism.
TI  - High-throughput sequence alignment using Graphics Processing Units.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The recent availability of new, less expensive high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies has yielded a dramatic increase in the volume of sequence data that must be analyzed. These data are being generated for several purposes, including genotyping, genome resequencing, metagenomics, and de novo genome assembly projects. Sequence alignment programs such as MUMmer have proven essential for analysis of these data, but researchers will need ever faster, high-throughput alignment tools running on inexpensive hardware to keep up with new sequence technologies. RESULTS: This paper describes MUMmerGPU, an open-source high-throughput parallel pairwise local sequence alignment program that runs on commodity Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) in common workstations. MUMmerGPU uses the new Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) from nVidia to align multiple query sequences against a single reference sequence stored as a suffix tree. By processing the queries in parallel on the highly parallel graphics card, MUMmerGPU achieves more than a 10-fold speedup over a serial CPU version of the sequence alignment kernel, and outperforms the exact alignment component of MUMmer on a high end CPU by 3.5-fold in total application time when aligning reads from recent sequencing projects using Solexa/Illumina, 454, and Sanger sequencing technologies. CONCLUSION: MUMmerGPU is a low cost, ultra-fast sequence alignment program designed to handle the increasing volume of data produced by new, high-throughput sequencing technologies. MUMmerGPU demonstrates that even memory-intensive applications can run significantly faster on the relatively low-cost GPU than on the CPU.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of virulence and pathology of Streptococcus suis serotypes 2 and 9 in experimentally infected growers.
AB  - Streptococcus (S.) suis is an invasive porcine pathogen causing meningitis, septicemia, arthritis and other diseases. Studies on pathogenesis as well as vaccine trials have focused on serotype 2 strains, which are worldwide the most prevalent among invasive isolates. However, in Europe serotype 9 strains also contribute substantially to S. suis-associated invasive diseases of piglets. The objective of this study was to determine the virulence of an MRP* SLY+ serotype 9 S. suis strain in comparison to an MRP+ EF+ SLY+ serotype 2 strain. Experimental intranasal and intravenous infections of 7-8 weeks old SPF piglets were investigated with regard to clinic and pathology. In contrast to the virulent serotype 2 strain, the serotype 9 strain did not cause disease with clinical manifestations after intranasal administration. However, histological screenings of these animals revealed pathological lesions, such as mild focal suppurative meningitis. Clinical manifestations related to meningitis, arthritis and serositis could be induced by intravenous application of this serotype 9 strain. Bacteriological culture and immunohistochemistry of the brain confirmed association with the S. suis challenge strains in all cases with clinical manifestations. Interestingly, expression of MRP within meningitis lesions was demonstrated for both pathotypes via immunohistochemistry. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that MRP* SLY+ serotype 9 strains are less virulent for growers than MRP+ EF+ SLY+ serotype 2 strains. Thus, intravenous application of this serotype 9 strain is required to evaluate heterologous protection in the course of vaccine development based on serotype 2 strains in the future.
TI  - [Cloning, expression and characterization analysis of the arginine deiminase of Streptococcus suis of China isolates].
AB  - PCR analysis demonstrated the presence of the ad gene in all 29 S. suis strains tested, but none of the seven S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus strains. The fragment of ad gene of virulent isolate SS2-HA9801 was later cloned into pBAD/Myc-HisC vector via restriction endonuclease and then transformed into host strain TOP10. A recombinant protein of 47000Da was highly expressed after induced by L-ararose and purified by Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. Western blotting demonstrated that the recombinant protein can reacted to the polyclonal antibody raised against whole-cell protein of SS2-HA9801, which suggested that it possessed some immunogenicity and may be important for further research. Enzymatic assay revealed that the optimum temperature for its activity is 37 degrees C and pH is 6.5. Studies with class-specific inhibitors supported the assignment of a sulfhydryl enzyme with some metallo class characteristics.
TI  - Immunoproteomics of extracellular proteins of Chinese virulent strains of Streptococcus suis type 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis type 2 (SS2) is a porcine zoonotic pathogen with worldwide distribution, and lacking suitable vaccine and virulent maker were bottleneck to control this infection. An immunoproteomic assay was used to identify antigenic proteins from the total extracellular proteins of the virulent Chinese SS2 strain ZY05719. The convalescent serum of a specific pathogen free (SPF) mini-pig recognized nine protein spots on PVDF membrane. Antigenic proteins on a duplicate gel, as well as those with a similar placement of extracellular proteins from another virulent strain (HA9801) and an avirulent strain (T15) on 2-D gels, were excised and identified by MALDI-TOF-MS. PMF of the protein spots were performed using the MASCOT server. Two proteins were found in all three strains. Comparative proteomic analysis between the two virulent strains and the avirulent strain revealed nine differential proteins, eight of which were successfully identified. Genes for six of the differentially expressed proteins were found in both virulent strains, and of those were present in the avirulent stain.
TI  - The key virulence-associated genes of Streptococcus suis type 2 are upregulated and differentially expressed in vivo.
AB  - Streptococcus suis causes disease in both pigs and humans. Many virulence genes,  including mrp, ef, sly, gapdh, fbps, and hyl, are shown to contribute to S. suis pathogenesis. In this study, the differential expression of the key S. suis serotype 2 virulence-associated genes was monitored 24 and 48 h after infection of HeLa cells. Gene expression was further investigated in bacteria harvested from the blood, lungs, brains, and synovia of swine 24, 48, and 72 h postintravenous infection with S. suis serotype 2. Bacterial RNA was extracted and gene expression was monitored using real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR at various time points. The results showed that after 24 h postinfection in vivo, mrp, gapdh, fbps, and hyl were highly expressed in all organs. At 48 h postinfection, ef and sly were highly expressed in the lungs and brain. At 72 h postinfection, all genes had a high level of expression in all organs. This study provides direct evidence that S. suis serotype 2 key virulence-associated genes are differentially expressed in a time-specific or an organ-specific manner in vivo. These findings also show the dynamic distribution of gene expression. Characterization of the differential expression patterns of this subset of key virulence-associated genes facilitates further study into the importance of these genes in S. suis serotype 2 pathogenesis in pigs.
TI  - Characterisation of biofilm formation by a Streptococcus suis meningitis isolate.
AB  - Biofilm formation by a strain of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 isolated from a case of meningitis in pigs was characterised. Using a polystyrene microtitre plate assay, S. suis 95-8242 produced a dense biofilm when glucose, fructose or sucrose was used as the carbohydrate source, whereas no biofilm formed in the presence of lactose. Polysaccharide production by the biofilm-forming strain was demonstrated by the Congo red agar assay. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that bacterial cells were surrounded by a thick layer of polycationic ferritin-labelled material. S. suis 95-8242 was more resistant to both penicillin G and ampicillin in biofilms than in planktonic cultures on the basis of minimal inhibitory and minimal bactericidal concentrations.
TI  - Disruption of srtA gene in Streptococcus suis results in decreased interactions with endothelial cells and extracellular matrix proteins.
AB  - Streptococcus suis, a major pathogen of swine, is an emerging zoonotic agent which causes meningitis and septic shock. In this study, we investigated the ability of S. suis mutant strain (SRTDeltaA) lacking the sortase A gene (srtA) to interact with host cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, as well as its virulence in a mouse infection model. We demonstrated that mutant SRTDeltaA had reduced capacity to adhere to and invade porcine brain microvascular endothelial cells compared to the wild-type strain. In addition, mutant SRTDeltaA also showed significantly less adherence to plasma fibronectin, cellular fibronectin and collagen type I. However, disruption of srtA had little effect on the virulence of S. suis in a mouse intraperitoneal model of infection. These results indicate that surface proteins anchored by sortase A are required for a normal level of bacterial binding. However, other factors may also be important for S. suis virulence and interaction with host tissues.
TI  - [Clinical features and outcome of infection of type 2 Streptococcus suis in human].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analysis the clinical features and efficacy of treatment for patients with type 2 Streptococcus suis (S. suis 2) infection, and to inform better diagnosis and treatment of S. suis 2. METHODS: Clinical data of 68 patients with S. suis 2 infection were retrieved retrospectively. The diagnoses were confirmed by clinical symtom or/and isolation of S. suis 2 from the infected sites in Shichuan province in the summer of 2005. The patients ranged from general type (simple sepsis) to septic shock type; meningitis type and mixed type. RESULTS: The outbreak of S. suis 2 infection occurred in June to August in 2005. The common source of infection came from pigs. The people in great risks were farmers who exposed to sick or dead pigs with S. suis 2 infection. Most infection occurred on the people who slaughtered infected pigs, followed by those who dressed infected meats. The prominent symptoms included fever with sharp chills, dizziness, headache, malaise and myalgia. Some patients had abdominal pain and diarrhea. Septic shock and coma often occurred in severe cases. According to the clinical manifestations, patients were categorized into four different clinical types: general type, septic shock type, meningitis type, and mixed type. S. suis 2 isolated from the patients were susceptible to most antimicrobial agents, except for tetracycline. All of the patients were treated with beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillins or cephalosporins). Some were given combined antimicrobial agents. Seventy seven percent (52/68) of patients survived. All of the general patients recovered completely. Fifty eight percent (15/26) of patients with septic shock died. The artificial ventilation and persistent blood filtering treatment played an important role for treating patients with septic shock. Although most patients with meningitis (97.5%) survived, a decrease in hearing or even hearing loss occurred to some of the survivors. CONCLUSION: Purulent meningitis and septic shock are the major clinical manifestations for S. suis 2 infection in human. The treatment for patients with meningitis is more effective than that for patients with septic shock.
TI  - [Development and characterization of monoclonal Antibody against M-like protein of Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus from pig].
AB  - Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus belongs to lancefield group C streptococcus, which can cause disease both in animals and humans. It has been associated with a wide variety of serious infections, including meningitis, pneumonia, septic arthritis and mastitis. The M like proteins on the surface of S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus have an antiphagocytic role analogous to that of group A streptococcal M proteins that are essential in establishing infection. In the present study, the M-like gene without partial signal peptide sequence was amplified from genomic DNA of S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus ATCC35246 strain isolated from pig by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Then the amplified fragment was cloned in the proper orientation into the site between EcoR I and Xho I of pET32-a(+) via restriction endonuclease EcoR I and Xho I. The recombinant plasmid was verified by restriction endonuclease analysis and nucleotide sequencing, then transformed into E. coli BL21. An fusion protein was expressed in BL21 after induced by IPTG, SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the recombinant protein had a molecular weight of 60 kD, Western blotting showed a positive reaction with the antiserum against ATCC35246. To prepare the monoclonal antibodies (McAbs) against the M-like protein, 6-8 weeks old BABL/c mice were immunized endermicly with purified recombinant M-like protein by Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. Splenocytes from the immuniszed mice were fused with SP2/0 and indirect ELISA was used to screen hybridoma cells. 12 hybridoma cell lines secreting McAbs against M-like protein of Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus were generated, and indirect ELISA confirmed that these McAbs only reacted with M-like protein, but not reacted with other bacteria such as group A Streptococci, Streptococcus suis type 2, Streptococcus equi. The indirect ELISA titers of these 12 ascites McAbs were about 2.56 x 10(4) to 1.01 x 10(5) , and the subtype of these McAbs belong to IgG2b, IgG1, IgM. The results of adhersion inhibition showed McAbs 2C8 could inhibit the adhersion of M-like protein to HEp-2 cell.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of streptococci from various indications of swine, horses, dogs and cats as determined in the BfT-GermVet monitoring program 2004-2006.
AB  - A total of 500 streptococci from two indications of swine (beta-haemolytic streptococci from infections of the urinary/genital tract including strains from the mastitis metritis agalactia syndrome as well as S. suis from infections of the central nervous system and the musculoskeletal system), two indications of horses (S. equi from respiratory tract infections and beta-haemolytic streptococci from infections of the genital tract), as well as three indications of dogs and cats (beta-haemolytic streptococci from infections of the respiratory tract, the urinary/genital tract, and skin/ear/mouth) were investigated for their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. Regardless of the animal origin and indication, the most frequently detected resistance properties were resistances against sulfamethoxazole (20-78%), tetracycline (17-93%) as well as gentamicin (14-79%). Resistance to penicillins or cephalosporins was very rarely detected - if at all.
TI  - [Study on the molecular epidemiology of Streptococcus suis type 2 from healthy pigs in Guangxi].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In order to investigate the positive rate of streptococcus suis type 2 and the genes of their suilysin (sly), extracellular protein (epf) and muramidasa-released protein ( mrp) and to understand the antibiotic susceptibility of S. suis type 2. METHODS: S. suis type 2, isolated from slaughtered healthy pig's tonsil in 10 county area of Guangxi, were identified by Multiplex PCR, and the genes of their sly, epf, mrp and the antimicrobial sensitivity analysis were performed. RESULTS: 1105 strains of Streptococcus including 667 strains of S. suis and 33 strains of S. suis type 2 were detected from 1179 samples. In these S. suis type 2 strains, there were 22 strains of sly + mrp + epf+ type,1 strain of sly + mrp + epf - type, 2 strains of sly - mrp + epf + type, 7 strains of sly - mrp + epf - type and 1 strain of sly - mrp - epf- type. When these strains were subjected to be tested with penicillin, eritrocina, vacocin, gentamycin, specti-nomysin, enraxacin, ciprofloxaxin, cephalothin VI, sulfadiazine sodium, cyantin, mycifradin, amikacin and achromcin, some were found to be resistant to but most strains were susceptible to cephalothin VI, penicillin and enraxacin. There were 31, 29 and 27 strains over medium sensitivity, respectively, but 28 and 27 resistant strains to amikacin and achromcin were found. CONCLUSION: The positive rate of S. suis type 2 in clinical healthy pigs was low (2.8%) and did not show obvious difference between the counties with or without a history of S. suis infection. All the isolated strains were susceptible to cephalothin VI, but most strains were virulent.

TI  - The Streptococcus pyogenes serotype M49 Nra-Ralp3 transcriptional regulatory network and its control of virulence factor expression from the novel eno ralp3 epf sagA pathogenicity region.
AB  - Many Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus [GAS]) virulence factor- and transcriptional regulator-encoding genes cluster together in discrete genomic regions. Nra is a central regulator of the FCT region. Previous studies exclusively described Nra as a transcriptional repressor of adhesin and toxin genes. Here transcriptome and proteome analysis of a serotype M49 GAS strain and an isogenic Nra mutant of this strain revealed the complete Nra regulon profile. Nra is active in all growth phases tested, with the largest regulon in the transition phase. Almost exclusively, virulence factor-encoding genes are repressed by Nra; these genes include the GAS pilus operon, the capsule synthesis operon, the cytolysin-mediated translocation system genes, all Mga region core virulence genes, and genes encoding other regulators, like the Ihk/Irr system, Rgg, and two additional RofA-like protein family regulators. Surprisingly, our experiments revealed that Nra additionally acts as a positive regulator, mostly for genes encoding proteins and enzymes with metabolic functions. Epidemiological investigations revealed strong genetic linkage of one particular Nra-repressed regulator, Ralp3 (SPy0735), with a gene encoding Epf (extracellular protein factor from Streptococcus suis). In a serotype-specific fashion, this ralp3 epf gene block is integrated, most likely via transposition, into the eno sagA virulence gene block, which is present in all GAS serotypes. In GAS serotypes M1, M4, M12, M28, and M49 this novel discrete genetic region is therefore designated the eno ralp3 epf sagA (ERES) pathogenicity region. Functional experiments showed that Epf is a novel GAS plasminogen-binding protein and revealed that Ralp3 activity counteracts Nra and MsmR regulatory activity. In addition to the Mga and FCT regions, the ERES region is the third discrete chromosomal pathogenicity region. All of these regions are transcriptionally linked, adding another level of complexity to the known GAS growth phase-dependent regulatory network.
TI  - Existence and characterization of allelic variants of Sao, a newly identified surface protein from Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Surface antigen one (Sao) is a newly identified protein from the major zoonotic pathogen, Streptococcus suis. In search of functional proteins related to the pathogenesis of Chinese S. suis 2 (SS2), unexpectedly, a variant of Sao protein was obtained. To test its prevalence in S. suis, PCR assay was adopted to address the coding genes systematically. It was found that there are three allelic variants of sao gene, namely sao-S, sao-M, and sao-L based on the different lengths of the genes (approximately 1.5, approximately 1.7, and approximately 2.0 kb, respectively). These differences were determined to be caused by heterogeneity within the number of C-terminal repeat sequences (R), which had been seen as a pathogenicity-related domain in the plant pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae. Two variants (sao-M and sao-L) were only found in SS2. All three variant proteins were prepared in vitro and their biochemical and biophysical properties were characterized. A soluble form of Sao-M protein was then used as a capture antigen to develop an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method to detect antibodies against SS2 in convalescent pig sera. Taken together, the results exhibit the properties of Sao proteins and provide an efficient Sao-M-based method for monitoring SS2 infection.

AB  - Immunoproteomic approaches were undertaken to study the immunogenicity of the membrane-associated proteins of the Streptococcus suis type 2 (SS2) China vaccine strain HA9801. The membrane-associated proteins were enriched using the Triton X-114 extraction protocol and were analysed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and subsequent immunoblotting using the hyperimmune serum of SS2-HA9801-immunized specific pathogen free (SPF) minipigs. A total of 11 proteins were recognized, and the corresponding spots on a duplicate gel were excised and identified by MALDI-TOF MS.
TI  - Streptococcus suis infections in humans: the Chinese experience and the situation in North America.
AB  - Infections caused by Streptococcus suis are considered a global problem in the swine industry. In this animal species, S. suis is associated with septicemia, meningitis, endocarditis, arthritis and, occasionally, other infections. Moreover, it is an agent of zoonosis that afflicts people in close contact with infected pigs or pork-derived products. Although sporadic cases of S. suis infection in humans have been reported, a large outbreak due to S. suis serotype 2 emerged in the summer of 2005 in Sichuan, China. A similar outbreak was observed in another Chinese province in 1998. Symptoms reported in these two outbreaks include high fever, malaise, nausea and vomiting, followed by nervous symptoms, subcutaneous hemorrhage, septic shock and coma in severe cases. The increased severity of S. suis infections in humans, such as a shorter incubation time, more rapid disease progression and higher rate of mortality, underscores the critical need to better understand the factors associated with pathogenesis of S. suis infection. From the 35 capsular serotypes currently known, serotype 2 is considered the most virulent and frequently isolated in both swine and humans. Here, we review the epidemiological, clinical and immunopathological features of S. suis infection in humans.
TI  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2, an important swine and human pathogen, induces strong systemic and cerebral inflammatory responses in a mouse model of infection.
AB  - Streptococcus suis, an important swine and human pathogen, causes septic shock and meningitis. The pathogenesis of both systemic and CNS infections caused by S. suis is poorly understood. A hematogenous model of infection in CD1 mice was developed to study the systemic release of cytokines during the septic shock phase and the proinflammatory events in the CNS associated with this pathogen. Using a liquid array system, high levels of systemic TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-12, IFN-gamma, CCL2, CXCL1, and CCL5 were observed 24 h after infection and might be responsible for the sudden death of 20% of animals. Infected mice that survived the early sepsis later developed clinical signs of meningitis and exhibited lesions in the meninges and in numerous regions of the brain, such as the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, and corpus callosum. Bacterial Ags were found in association with microglia residing only in the affected zones. In situ hybridization combined with immunocytochemistry showed transcriptional activation of TLR2 and TLR3 as well as CD14, NF-kappaB, IL-1beta, CCL2, and TNF-alpha, mainly in myeloid cells located in affected cerebral structures. Early transcriptional activation of TLR2, CD14, and inflammatory cytokines in the choroid plexus and cells lining the brain endothelium suggests that these structures are potential entry sites for the bacteria into the CNS. Our data indicate an important role of the inflammatory response in the pathogenesis of S. suis infection in mice. This experimental model may be useful for studying the mechanisms underlying sepsis and meningitis during bacterial infection.

TI  - Inhibition of P-fimbriated Escherichia coli adhesion by multivalent galabiose derivatives studied by a live-bacteria application of surface plasmon resonance.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Uropathogenic P-fimbriated Escherichia coli adheres to host cells by  specific adhesins recognizing galabiose (Galalpha1-4Gal)-containing structures on cell surfaces. In search of agents inhibiting this first step of infection, the inhibition potency of a set of synthetic mono- and multivalent galabiose compounds was evaluated. In order to mimic the flow conditions of natural infections, a live-bacteria application of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was established. METHODS AND RESULTS: For the measurement of the binding of E. coli to a surface containing galabiose, live bacteria were injected over the flow cell, and the inhibition of adhesion caused by the galabiose inhibitors was recorded. Quantitative binding data were recorded in real-time for each inhibitor. The results were compared with those of conventional static haemagglutination and ELISA-based cell adhesion assays. Compared with the Gram-positive Streptococcus suis bacteria, which also bind to galabiose and whose binding inhibition is strongly dependent on the multivalency of the inhibitor, E. coli inhibition was only moderately affected by the valency. However, a novel octavalent compound was found to be the most effective inhibitor of E. coli PapG(J96) adhesion, with an IC50 value of 2 microM. CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of bacterial adhesion by SPR is an efficient way to characterize the adhesion of whole bacterial cells and allows the characterization of the inhibitory potency of adhesion inhibitors under dynamic flow conditions. Under these conditions, multivalency increases the anti-adhesion potency of galabiose-based inhibitors of P-fimbriated E. coli adhesion and provides a promising approach for the design of high-affinity anti-adhesion agents.

AB  - In this study, an immunochromatographic strip (ICS) was developed for the detection of antibody against Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2). Colloidal gold particles labeled with staphylococcal protein A (SPA), which can bind to the F(C) fragment of mammalian immunoglobulin, were used as the detector reagent. The capsular polysaccharide (CPS) of SS2 and affinity-purified IgG from a healthy naive pig were immobilized on test and control regions of a nitrocellulose membrane, respectively. The ICS was used to 1) detect anti-CPS antibody in 14 sera taken from 4 SS2-infected pigs, 24 sera from pigs hyperimmunized with SS2, and 68 sera from pigs inoculated or infected with bacteria other than SS2; 2) determine anti-CPS antibody titers of 20 positive sera for comparison with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); and 3) detect anti-CPS antibody in 226 clinical sera taken from diseased pigs also for comparison with ELISA. An ELISA used as a reference test determined the specificity and sensitivity of the ICS to be 97.1% and 86.3%, respectively. There was excellent agreement between the results obtained by ELISA and the ICS (kappa = 0.843). Additionally, there was strong agreement between the results of bacterial isolation from pig tonsils and ICS test (kappa = 0.658). Because it is rapid and easy to use, the test is suitable for the serological surveillance of SS2 at farms.
TI  - Human meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis: the first case report from north-eastern Italy.
AB  - We describe the first case of Streptococcus suis meningitis in the north-east of  Italy. We would like to stress that Streptococcus suis should be seriously considered in the differential diagnosis of human meningitis especially in adults with a recent history of close contact with pigs or unprocessed pork meat.
TI  - Immunization with recombinant Sao protein confers protection against Streptococcus suis infection.
AB  - Sao is a Streptococcus suis surface protein recently identified as a potential vaccine candidate. In this study, recombinant Sao in combination with Quil A provided cross-protection against S. suis serotype 2 disease in mouse and pig vaccination protocols. Subcutaneous immunization of mice elicited strong immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody responses. All four IgG subclasses were induced, with the IgG2a titer being the highest, followed by those of IgG1, IgG2b, and IgG3. Challenge of the mice with S. suis strain 31533 resulted in a mortality rate of 80% for the control group, which received Quil A only. In contrast, all of the mice immunized with Sao survived. In a pig vaccination protocol, intramuscular immunization with Sao also elicited significant humoral antibody responses, and both the IgG1 and IgG2 subclasses were induced, with a predominance of IgG2 production. In vitro assay showed that Sao-induced antibodies significantly promoted the ability of porcine neutrophils in opsonophagocytic killing of S. suis. An aerosol challenge of the pigs with S. suis strain 166 resulted in clinical signs characteristic of S. suis infection in diseased pigs. The vaccine group showed significantly better survival, lower clinical scores, and less S. suis recovery from postmortem tissue samples than did the control group. Furthermore, this study also revealed that although challenge S. suis strains express Sao size variants, recombinant Sao conferred cross-protection. These data demonstrate that recombinant Sao formulated with Quil A triggers strong opsonizing antibody responses which confer efficient immunity against challenge infection with heterologous S. suis type 2.
TI  - Adhesion activity of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in a Chinese Streptococcus suis type 2 strain.
AB  - A total of 36 streptococcal strains, including seven S. equi ssp.zooepidemicus, two S. suis type 1 (SS1), 24 SS2, two SS9, and one SS7, were tested for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (gapdh). Except from non-virulent SS2 strain T1 5, all strains harboured gapdh. The gapdh of Chinese Sichuan SS2 isolate ZY05719 and Jiangsu SS2 isolate HA9801 were sequenced and then compared with published sequences in the GenBank. The comparison revealed a 99.9 % and 99.8 % similarity of ZY05719 and HA9801, respectively, with the published sequence. Adherence assay data demonstrated a significant ((p<0.05)) reduction in adhesion of SS2 in HEp-2 cells pre-incubated with purified GAPDH compared to non pre-incubated controls, suggesting the GAPDH mediates SS2 bacterial adhesion to host cells.
TI  - [Investigation of a possible chain of Streptococcus suis infection in a pig breeding community using PCR-based genotyping].
AB  - Streptococcus (S.) suis plays an important role in pig breeding causing invasive  diseases such as meningitis and polyarthritis. Herd problems with Streptococcus suis are common in many pig farms and are frequently characterised by disease outbreaks. In this context, it is often important to identify chains of infection, e.g. between a farrow-to-wean and a grower farm. In the following case report a possible chain of infection among the different farms of a farrow-to-finish system was investigated. In two grower units herd problems with S. suis were present; the mortality was higher than 5 %. It appeared likely, that the streptococci causing these problems were transmitted from a single farrow-to-wean unit to the two different grower farms. In the respective farms swabs were taken from different healthy animals and, in the case of the grower farms, also from the infected animals. Genotypic profiling of strains by a multiplex-PCR and AFLP typing method revealed that two different S. suis pathotypes were responsible for the herd problems. Both pathotypes could not be detected in the farrow-to-wean farm.Thus, a chain of infection originating from the farrow-to-wean farm appeared unlikely. The multiplex PCR was in this case sufficient to elucidate the described problem.
TI  - MobilomeFINDER: web-based tools for in silico and experimental discovery of bacterial genomic islands.
AB  - MobilomeFINDER (http://mml.sjtu.edu.cn/MobilomeFINDER) is an interactive online tool that facilitates bacterial genomic island or 'mobile genome' (mobilome) discovery; it integrates the ArrayOme and tRNAcc software packages. ArrayOme utilizes a microarray-derived comparative genomic hybridization input data set to generate 'inferred contigs' produced by merging adjacent genes classified as 'present'. Collectively these 'fragments' represent a hypothetical 'microarray-visualized genome (MVG)'. ArrayOme permits recognition of discordances between physical genome and MVG sizes, thereby enabling identification of strains rich in microarray-elusive novel genes. Individual tRNAcc tools facilitate automated identification of genomic islands by comparative analysis of the contents and contexts of tRNA sites and other integration hotspots in closely related sequenced genomes. Accessory tools facilitate design of hotspot-flanking primers for in silico and/or wet-science-based interrogation of cognate loci in unsequenced strains and analysis of islands for features suggestive of foreign origins; island-specific and genome-contextual features are tabulated and represented in schematic and graphical forms. To date we have used MobilomeFINDER to analyse several Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus suis genomes. MobilomeFINDER enables high-throughput island identification and characterization through increased exploitation of emerging sequence data and PCR-based profiling of unsequenced test strains; subsequent targeted yeast recombination-based capture permits full-length sequencing and detailed functional studies of novel genomic islands.

TI  - [Meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis].
AB  - HISTORY AND ADMISSION FINDINGS: A 42-year-old man was admitted to hospital because of headache and fever for two days and showing signs of meningism. As a butcher he had had frequent cuts on his hands and forearms. INVESTIGATIONS AND DIAGNOSIS: Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid revealed an elevated leukocyte count (81% segmented neutrophils). Large numbers of Gram-positive bacteria were found in both cerebrospinal fluid and blood culture, which were subsequently identified as Streptococcus suis (S. suis) by biochemical methods. The hypothesis of bacterial meningitis was thus confirmed. TREATMENT AND CLINICAL COURSE: The patient was treated with ampicillin, initially combined with ceftriaxone. Hearing impairment and vestibular dysfunction - a frequent complication after infection with S. suis - were observed as sequelae, indicating involvement of the vestibulocochlear nerve. CONCLUSION: Infections caused by S. suis are rare in Europe but must be taken into account if an occupational exposition to pigs is established.
TI  - [Homologous analysis of Streptococcus suis srt gene and prokaryotic expression of srtA].
AB  - AIM: To elucidate the distribution of srt gene in the genome of S.suis 05ZYH33, prokaryotically express Sortase A and analyze its antigenicity. METHODS: Homologous genes encoding sortase family members were analyzed, and then the srtA gene of S.suis was cloned and sequenced. The recombinant protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. The mice were immunized with recombinant protein and the antibody titer was determined by indirect ELISA. RESULTS: All the putative srt genes in the genome of 05ZYH33 were analyzed. Six genes were found to be homologous to srt of S.suis isolated in Japan. The predicted srtA and sortase-like proteins were members of Class A of sortase family while srtBCD and srtE belonged to Class B. Western blot analysis showed that the recombinant protein was reactive to with the serum from the rabbits infected with a virulent strain of S.suis Type 2. The antibody titer in blood serum reached 1:6 400 after immunization with recombinant protein four times. CONCLUSION: Compared with the isolated strain from Japan a new putative srt gene was found in 05ZYH33. The srtA gene was successfully expressed in prokaryotic system and the recombinant protein showed specific antigenicity, which is important for future research of the function of Sortase.
TI  - Elimination of strains of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 from the tonsils of carrier sows by combined medication and vaccination.
AB  - The effect of vaccination with a killed whole-cell vaccine of extracellular factor-positive Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S suis 2 EF(+)) combined with medication with amoxicillin on the presence of virulent S suis 2 EF(+) strains on the tonsils of sows and their offspring was evaluated. In two herds, 14 pregnant sows that carried these virulent strains, as detected by PCR in three consecutive tonsillar brush samples, were selected and randomly assigned to be treated or left untreated as controls. The treated sows were vaccinated at six and three weeks before the expected farrowing date and medicated from one week before expected farrowing until the end of the experiment. Two weeks before parturition, the sows were housed in individual isolation farrowing rooms, and the sow and its litter were sampled by using tonsil brushes and tonsil swabs, respectively. Approximately 27 days postpartum, the sows and their piglets were euthanased and their tonsils were collected and analysed by pcr. No S suis 2 EF(+) could be detected in the tonsils of the seven treated sows, but the tonsils of the seven untreated sows remained positive. Only one of the litters of the untreated sows became infected, five days after birth, and none of the litters of the treated sows became infected.
TI  - Use of selective capture of transcribed sequences to identify genes preferentially expressed by Streptococcus suis upon interaction with porcine brain microvascular endothelial cells.
AB  - By using the selective capture of transcribed sequences (SCOTS) approach, we identified 28 genes preferentially expressed by the major swine pathogen and zoonotic agent Streptococcus suis upon interaction with porcine brain microvascular endothelial cells. Several of these genes may be considered new S. suis candidate virulence factors. Results from this study demonstrate the suitability of SCOTS for the elucidation of gene expression in streptococcal species and may contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of S. suis infections.
TI  - Characterization of the invasion of porcine endothelial cells by Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is an important swine pathogen associated mainly with meningitis. In a previous study, we demonstrated the ability of S. suis serotype 2 to adhere to and invade immortalized porcine brain microvascular endothelial cells (PBMECs) forming the blood-brain barrier. The aim of the current work was to further characterize the mechanism(s) by which S. suis invades porcine endothelial cells. The ability of several S. suis strains to interact with PBMECs was not found to correlate with their geographic origin, virulence, host of origin, or suilysin production. Characterization studies demonstrated that proteinaceous adhesins/invasins, cell wall components, lipoteichoic acid, and serum components (including fibronectin) were involved in interactions between S. suis and PBMECs. In addition to PBMECs, S. suis was able to adhere to and invade 2 porcine aortic endothelial cell lines and primary PBMECs.
TI  - Evolution of the core and pan-genome of Streptococcus: positive selection, recombination, and genome composition.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The genus Streptococcus is one of the most diverse and important human and agricultural pathogens. This study employs comparative evolutionary analyses of 26 Streptococcus genomes to yield an improved understanding of the relative roles of recombination and positive selection in pathogen adaptation to their hosts. RESULTS: Streptococcus genomes exhibit extreme levels of evolutionary plasticity, with high levels of gene gain and loss during species and strain evolution. S. agalactiae has a large pan-genome, with little recombination in its core-genome, while S. pyogenes has a smaller pan-genome and much more recombination of its core-genome, perhaps reflecting the greater habitat, and gene pool, diversity for S. agalactiae compared to S. pyogenes. Core-genome recombination was evident in all lineages (18% to 37% of the core-genome judged to be recombinant), while positive selection was mainly observed during species differentiation (from 11% to 34% of the core-genome). Positive selection pressure was unevenly distributed across lineages and biochemical main role categories. S. suis was the lineage with the greatest level of positive selection pressure, the largest number of unique loci selected, and the largest amount of gene gain and loss. CONCLUSION: Recombination is an important evolutionary force in shaping Streptococcus genomes, not only in the acquisition of significant portions of the genome as lineage specific loci, but also in facilitating rapid evolution of the core-genome. Positive selection, although undoubtedly a slower process, has nonetheless played an important role in adaptation of the core-genome of different Streptococcus species to different hosts.
TI  - Meningitis due to Streptococcus suis with no contact with pigs or porcine products.
AB  
TI  - Interactions between Streptococcus suis serotype 2 and cells of the myeloid lineage in the palatine tonsil of the pig.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is a major pathogen in pigs and causes significant morbidity and mortality in herds world-wide. A major problem with S. suis is the presence of asymptomatic carrier animals which can spread the organism within and between herds. The palatine tonsil is one of the main sites where the organism can be recovered, both in infected and carrier animals. The use of multiple-colour immunohistology allowed identification of the cell types associated with bacteria in the tonsils of infected gnotobiotic piglets. Bacteria were never associated with T-cells or B-cells but were always associated with cells of the myeloid lineage. Expression of CD16 and CD163 on these leukocytes suggested an association with mature macrophages in tonsil, which may lead to clearance or control of the micro-organism.
TI  - A glimpse of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome from comparative genomics of S. suis 2 Chinese isolates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is an important zoonotic pathogen, causing more than 200 cases of severe human infection worldwide, with the hallmarks of meningitis, septicemia, arthritis, etc. Very recently, SS2 has been recognized as an etiological agent for streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS), which was originally associated with Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) in Streptococci. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying STSS are poorly understood. METHODS AND FINDINGS: To elucidate the genetic determinants of STSS caused by SS2, whole genome sequencing of 3 different Chinese SS2 strains was undertaken. Comparative genomics accompanied by several lines of experiments, including experimental animal infection, PCR assay, and expression analysis, were utilized to further dissect a candidate pathogenicity island (PAI). Here we show, for the first time, a novel molecular insight into Chinese isolates of highly invasive SS2, which caused two large-scale human STSS outbreaks in China. A candidate PAI of approximately 89 kb in length, which is designated 89K and specific for Chinese SS2 virulent isolates, was investigated at the genomic level. It shares the universal properties of PAIs such as distinct GC content, consistent with its pivotal role in STSS and high virulence. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first PAI candidate from S. suis worldwide. Our finding thus sheds light on STSS triggered by SS2 at the genomic level, facilitates further understanding of its pathogenesis and points to directions of development on some effective strategies to combat highly pathogenic SS2 infections.
TI  - Detection of respiratory pathogens in porcine lung tissue and lavage fluid.
AB  - The objective of this study was to compare the detection rate of bacterial agents in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), taken without visual control, to that in affected lung tissue obtained from the same pig at necropsy. BALF and affected lung tissue were examined for Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae using PCR, and standard cultural methods were used for Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Haemophilus parasuis, Pasteurella multocida and Streptococcus suis. All pigs with a history of respiratory symptoms were submitted as live animals for routine diagnostic examination. In each animal the site of lavage, marked by injecting methylene blue, differed from the site of pneumonic lesions. M. hyopneumoniae was detected more frequently in lung tissue than in BALF in cases with moderate or severe lung lesions. The detection rates of M. hyopneumoniae were higher in the BALF of pigs with mild lesions. Cultural examination of BALF was at least as satisfactory as affected lung tissue for detecting B. bronchiseptica, H. parasuis and P. multocida.
TI  - Streptococcus suis: an emerging zoonotic pathogen.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is a major porcine pathogen worldwide, and can be transmitted  to human beings by close contact with sick or carrier pigs. S suis causes meningitis, septicaemia, endocarditis, arthritis, and septic shock in both pigs and human beings, and mortality is high. Human infection with S suis occurs mainly among certain risk groups that have frequent exposure to pigs or pork. Outbreaks of human S suis infection are uncommon, although several outbreaks have occurred in China in recent years. In July, 2005, the largest outbreak of human S suis infection occurred in Sichuan province, China, where 204 people were infected and 38 of them died. There have been 409 cases of human S suis infection worldwide, most of which have occurred in China, Thailand, and the Netherlands, and these infections have led to 73 deaths. This review provides background information on the biology and molecular characteristics of this Gram-positive bacterium, and describes the clinical signs, pathology, epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of human infection with S suis.
TI  - TLR2-dependent recognition of Streptococcus suis is modulated by the presence of  capsular polysaccharide which modifies macrophage responsiveness.
AB  - Streptococcus suis capsular type 2 is an important swine pathogen and an agent of zoonosis. Although meningitis is the most common form of disease, septicemia and septic shock are also frequently reported. Despite reports that CD14 is involved in the recognition of encapsulated S. suis by host cells, the mechanisms underlying exacerbated release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which may have a negative impact on disease outcome, are unclear. Here, we demonstrated that stimulation of human monocytes by whole encapsulated S. suis or its purified cell wall components influences the relative expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 and CD14 mRNA. Moreover, this stimulation triggered the release of cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6) and chemokines (IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), which was significantly reduced by antibody-mediated blocking of TLR2 but not TLR4. Mouse macrophages deficient in TLR2 also showed impaired cytokine responses to encapsulated bacteria. Given that this response was completely abrogated in myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-deficient macrophages, other TLRs might also be involved. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the presence of capsular polysaccharide (CPS)-modulated S. suis interactions with TLRs. In the absence of CPS, uncovered cell wall components induced cytokine and chemokine production via TLR2-dependent as well as -independent pathways, whereas CPS contributes to MCP-1 production in a MyD88-independent manner. Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of the inflammatory processes induced by an encapsulated pathogen and suggests that the relative expression of CPS, known to be modulated during bacterial invasion and dissemination in the host, might alter interactions with host cells and, consequently, the outcome of the inflammatory response.
TI  - [Changes of bacterial flora from hindguts of piglets after oral administration of lactobacillus amylovorus S1 as a probiotic strain].
AB  - Changes of bacterial flora from hindguts of piglets from 7 to 35 days of age (two weeks after weaning) were studied after oral administration of L. amylovorus S1, using molecular techniques based on 16S rDNA gene. Six litters of neonatal piglets were divided randomly into control group and treatment group. At 7, 9, 11 days of age, piglets in treatment group received 1, 2 and 3mL preparation of S1 (5 x 10(9) CFU/mL) through oral administration, respectively. On D 7, 14, 21, 24 and 35, one piglet from each litter was slaughtered and samples of hindguts were collected for analysis. The results showed that high G + C mol% bacteria in hindguts of piglets disappeared after weaning and restored gradually two weeks later. Sequencing analysis indicated that most of these high G + C mol% bacteria blonged to Lactobacillus spp. . Statistical analysis showed that treatment with S1 had no marked effect on diversity index of predominant bacteria from hindguts in piglets. By comparing the bands in DGGE profiles between two groups, a specific band in treatment group was found in profiles from piglets at 14 days of age, sequence matched with that showed 95 % similarity to Clostridium disporicum. At 35 days of age, another specific band appeared in control group, which was identified to be Streptococcus suis (99% ).
TI  - Potential use of an unencapsulated and aromatic amino acid-auxotrophic Streptococcus suis mutant as a live attenuated vaccine in swine.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is responsible for severe economic losses to the swine industry. Prevention of the diseases caused by this pathogen is hampered by the inability of available vaccines to generate a protective response in pigs. A non-virulent, aromatic amino acid-auxotrophic and unencapsulated mutant strain of S. suis was generated in this study and a preliminary evaluation of its protective capacities was conducted in swine. Deletion of the cognate promoter of the aro operon in S. suis virulent strain S735 resulted in the abolishment of the expression of the four members of the operon, aroA, aroK, pheA and orf10. The resulting mutant strain BD101 was auxotrophic for aromatic amino acids as demonstrated by its failure to grow in a chemically defined medium unless it was supplemented with these compounds. In addition, as a result of the deletion of the cognate promoter of the aro operon, mutant BD101 lost its encapsulated phenotype. A protection assay was performed by immunisation of pigs with live strain BD101. Vaccination resulted in minor clinical signs but did not substantially impair the growth of vaccinated animals. Immunisation of animals with live mutant BD101 induced a considerable antibody response against S. suis. Vaccinated pigs presented only minor clinical signs and a survival rate of 100%, while 57% of non-vaccinated animals died, after a challenge with the virulent parent strain S735. In order to prevent S. suis infections in swine, it may be useful to further evaluate strain BD101 as a vaccine candidate.
TI  - A novel signature-tagged mutagenesis system for Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an economically important, zoonotic pathogen causing death  and disease in swine. The objectives of this study were to develop a signature-tagged mutagenesis (STM) system for S. suis serotype 2 and to identify genes required for in vivo virulence. Identification of such candidate genes may lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of S. suis and may provide substrate for the discovery of new vaccines. A novel STM approach was designed to allow for a higher throughput assay of mutants using the Luminex xMAP system. Additionally, to speed the identification process, a direct genomic DNA sequencing method was developed that overcomes the problems associated with the presence of repetitive insertion sequences. Approximately 2600 mutants were screened through both mouse and caesarian-derived, colostrum-deprived (CDCD) pig models. The disrupted ORF was identified for each potential attenuated mutant, and mutants with distinct and unique mutated ORFs were analyzed individually for attenuation in mouse and CDCD pig models. A variety of genes were identified, including previously known genes essential to the virulence of other organisms, genes involved in capsule biosynthesis, a regulator of suilysin expression, and several conserved or predicted genes. Of the 22 mutants identified as attenuated in either animal model, eight insertion mutants caused no mortality in both mouse and pig models.
TI  - Variant size- and glycoforms of the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich protein gp-340 with differential bacterial aggregation.
AB  - Glycoprotein gp-340 aggregates bacteria in saliva as part of innate defence at mucosal surfaces. We have detected size- and glycoforms of gp-340 between human saliva samples (n = 7) and lung gp-340 from a proteinosis patient using antibodies and lectins in Western blots and ELISA measurements. Western blots of saliva samples, and of gp-340 purified, from the seven donors using a gp-340 specific antibody distinguished four gp-340 size variants, designated I to IV (n = 2,2,2 and 1). While saliva gp-340 variants I to III had single bands of increasing sizes, variant IV and lung gp-340 had double bands. Purified I to IV proteins all revealed a N-terminal sequence TGGWIP upon Edman degradation. Moreover, purified gp-340 from the seven donors and lung gp-340 shared N-glycans, sialylated Galbeta1-3GalNAc and (poly)lactosamine structures. However, the larger size gp-340 grouping II/III (n = 4) and smaller size grouping I/IV correlated with a secretor, Se(+), and a non secretor, Se(-), dependent glycoform of gp-340, respectively (p = 0.03). The Se(+) glycoforms contained ABH, Le(b), Le(y) and polylactosamine structures, while the Se(-) glycoforms lacked ABH antigens but expressed Le(a), Le(x) and lactosamine structures. By contrast, lung gp-340 completely lacked ABH, Le(a/b), Le(x/y) or sLe(x) structures. Gp-340 and secretor typing of saliva from additional donors (n = 29) showed gp-340 glycoforms I to IV for 6, 16, 4 and 0 donors, respectively, and 3 non-typeable donors, and verified that gp-340 glycoforms I and II/III correlate with Se(-) and Se(+) phenotypes, respectively (p < 0.0001). The glycoforms of saliva and lung gp-340 mediated differential aggregation of Le(b)- (Helicobacter pylori), sialylpolylactosamine- (Streptococcus suis) or sialic acid- (Streptococcus mutans) binding bacteria. In conclusion, variant size- and glycoforms of gp-340 are expressed by different individuals and may modulate the biological properties of gp-340 pertinent to health and disease.
TI  - Detection and molecular typing of Streptococcus suis in tonsils from live pigs in France.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important pathogen of swine, causing meningitis, arthritis, polyserositis, septicemia, and sudden death in weaning piglets as well as fattening pigs. Recently, 3 molecular tests have been developed in our laboratory: a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (m-PCR) assay for the detection of S. suis species and serotypes 2 and 1/2, and 2 molecular typing methods, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and an approach based on PCR amplification of a fragment of rRNA genes, including a part of the 16S and 23S genes and the 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region (ISR), followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis (ISR-RFLP). In the present study, we used these tests to analyze tonsil samples from clinically healthy pigs and to identify individual isolates of S. suis during epidemiologic investigations of 8 related herds with a history of septicemia caused by S. suis serotype 2. Capsular typing showed that 58% of the strains were nontypable. Of the 17 serotypes present, serotype 22 was the most prevalent. In the 7 farms without clinical signs on the day of sampling, we detected S. suis serotype 2 or 1/2, or both, in less than 5% of the pigs by m-PCR or by bacteriologic culture. In the 8th farm, on which 2 pigs had clinical signs of septicemia on the day of sampling, we detected S. suis serotype 2 or 1/2, or both, by m-PCR in the tonsils of 40% of fattening pigs (21 wk old) that lacked symptoms. Molecular typing of the serotype 2 strains showed a common origin of contamination in these herds, given that 1 pattern (C1) was detected in the isolates from 6 of the 8 herds. However, up to 4 patterns were associated with septicemia and sudden death. Several patterns of S. suis serotype 2 can be responsible for disease in the same herd. These molecular tools may be useful for confident studies of the transmission of S. suis, thereby contributing to the control of S. suis infection.
TI  - Characteristics of Streptococcus suis isolated from patients in Japan.
AB  - Seven cases of Streptococcus suis infection in Japan during 1994 and 2006 were summarized. All cases had porcine exposure and five of them had hand skin injury during the exposure. Five cases presented symptoms of meningitis, three presented symptoms of sepsis, and one resulted in sudden death. All of the isolated S. suis belonged to Lancefield's group D and to serotype 2. They were susceptible to penicillin G, ampicillin, cefotaxime, and ciprofloxacin. However, six of them were resistant to both erythromycin and clindamycin, and four were also resistant to minocycline. Multilocus sequence typing of six isolates showed that they belonged to sequence type (ST) 1, and their pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns were similar. The remaining isolate was ST28 and its PFGE pattern was distinct from those of the others.
TI  - Amplified fragment length polymorphism of Streptococcus suis strains correlates with their profile of virulence-associated genes and clinical background.
AB  - Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) typing was applied to 116 Streptococcus suis isolates with different clinical backgrounds (invasive/pneumonia/carrier/human) and with known profiles of virulence-associated genes (cps1, -2, -7 and -9, as well as mrp, epf and sly). A dendrogram was generated that allowed identification of two clusters (A and C) with different subclusters (A1, A2, C1 and C2) and two heterogeneous groups of strains (B and D). For comparison, three strains from each AFLP subcluster and group were subjected to multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis. The closest relationship and lowest diversity were found for patterns clustering within AFLP subcluster A1, which corresponded with sequence type (ST) complex 1. Strains within subcluster A1 were mainly invasive cps1 and mrp+ epf+ (or epf*) sly+ cps2+ strains of porcine or human origin. A new finding of this study was the clustering of invasive mrp* cps9 isolates within subcluster A2. MLST analysis suggested that A2 correlates with a single ST complex (ST87). In contrast to A1 and A2, subclusters C1 and C2 contained mainly pneumonia isolates of genotype cps7 or cps2 and epf- sly-. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that AFLP allows identification of clusters of S. suis strains with clinical relevance.
TI  - [Cloning and characterization of the gene encoding IMPDH of Streptococcus suis serotype 2].
AB  - Given the lack of effective vaccines to control Streptococcus suis infection and  the lack of a rapid and reliable molecular diagnostic assay to detect its infection, S. suis serotype 2 was sequenced partly in an effort to identify important virulence factors. Two new open reading frames were found located between orf2 and mrp. One of new open reading frame (2738 - 3694) that encoded a polypeptide of 319 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 33.5kDa was identified by Western blot. GenBank database search revealed that the derived amino acid sequence shared low homology with sequences of known function from other genes. Second structure was analyzed by InterPro, PHD, DNAstar software, the deduced protein had functional domains typical of IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH). The PCR product of the open reading frame was transformed into E. coli BL21 and the fusion protein of 48kDa was expressed. The recombinant protein was reactive with serum from pigs experimentally infected with virulent strains of S. suis type 2, suggesting that the protein is immunogenic. IMPDH activity staining confirmed that the protein has IMPDH function and can catalyze the rate-limiting reaction of GTP biosynthesis, the NAD-dependent reduction of IMP into XMP. Flow cytometry (FCM) revealed that the protein had apparent effect on HEp-2 cell cycle.

TI  - Rapid pulsed-field gel electrophoresis protocol for subtyping of Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - A rapid pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) protocol for subtyping of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 was developed and evaluated using 27 clinical isolates from 22 epidemiologically unrelated patients. Results were matched against antibiogram, virulence genotyping and multi locus sequence typing (MLST). PFGE appeared to be the most discriminatory with numerical index of discrimination (D) equal to 0.87.
TI  - First characterization of fluoroquinolone resistance in Streptococcus suis.
AB  - We have identified and sequenced the genes encoding the quinolone-resistance determining region (QRDR) of ParC and GyrA in fluoroquinolone-susceptible and -resistant Streptococcus suis clinical isolates. Resistance is the consequence of single point mutations in the QRDRs of ParC and GyrA and is not due to clonal spread of resistant strains or horizontal gene transfer with other bacteria.
TI  - Prevalence of Streptococcus suis genotypes in wild boars of Northwestern Germany.
AB  - Invasive serotype 2 (cps2+) strains of Streptococcus suis cause meningitis in pigs and humans. Four case reports of S. suis meningitis in hunters suggest transmission of S. suis through the butchering of wild boars. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of potentially human-pathogenic S. suis strains in wild boars. S. suis was isolated from 92% of all tested tonsils (n=200) from wild boars. A total of 244 S. suis isolates were genotyped using PCR assays for the detection of serotype-specific genes, the hemolysin gene sly, and the virulence-associated genes mrp and epf. The prevalence of the cps2+ genotype among strains from wild boars was comparable to that of control strains from domestic pig carriers. Ninety-five percent of the cps2+ wild boar strains were positive for mrp, sly, and epf*, the large variant of epf. Interestingly, epf* was significantly more frequently detected in cps2+ strains from wild boars than in those from domestic pigs; epf* is also typically found in European S. suis isolates from humans, including a meningitis isolate from a German hunter. These results suggest that at least 10% of wild boars in Northwestern Germany carry S. suis strains that are potentially virulent in humans. Additional amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis supported this hypothesis, since homogeneous clustering of the epf* mrp+ sly+ cps2+ strains from wild boars with invasive human and porcine strains was observed.
TI  - Identification of a novel virulence determinant with serum opacification activity in Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is a porcine and human pathogen with adhesive and invasive properties. In other streptococci, large surface-associated proteins (>100 kDa) of the MSCRAMM family (microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules) are key players in interactions with host tissue. In this study, we identified a novel opacity factor of S. suis (OFS) with structural homology to members of the MSCRAMM family. The N-terminal region of OFS is homologous to the respective regions of fibronectin-binding protein A (FnBA) of Streptococcus dysgalactiae and the serum opacity factor (SOF) of Streptococcus pyogenes. Similar to these two proteins, the N-terminal domain of OFS opacified horse serum. Serum opacification activity was detectable in sodium dodecyl sulfate extracts of wild-type S. suis but not in extracts of isogenic ofs knockout mutants. Heterologous expression of OFS in Lactococcus lactis demonstrated that a high level of expression of OFS is sufficient to provide surface-associated serum opacification activity. Furthermore, serum opacification could be inhibited by an antiserum against recombinant OFS. The C-terminal repetitive sequence elements of OFS differed significantly from the respective repeat regions of FnBA and SOF as well as from the consensus sequence of the fibronectin-binding repeats of MSCRAMMs. Accordingly, fibronectin binding was not detectable in recombinant OFS. To investigate the putative function of OFS in the pathogenesis of invasive S. suis diseases, piglets were experimentally infected with an isogenic mutant strain in which the ofs gene had been knocked out by an in-frame deletion. The mutant was severely attenuated in virulence but not in colonization, demonstrating that OFS represents a novel virulence determinant of S. suis.
TI  - [Isolation and identification of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 from sick-pig samples of Sichuan province].
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is a major pathogen frequently associated with infections in pigs. There are presently 35 serotypes of S.suis (serotype 1 to 34 and serotype 1/2) recognized on the basis of capsular antigens. Few people were reported to infect with SS2 in the past years. However, an accidental case happened in Sichuan province of China in 2005. Some people got ill and died, and all of them were closely contacted with sick pigs. Based on clinical features and epidemiologic data, this case could be caused by SS2 infection. Liver, spleen, kidney, lung and serum samples were collected and used for pathogen isolation and identification in laboratory, three strain bacteria were isolated. The three strains of SS2 showed typical morphology of SS2 on blood agar and under microscope with Gram stain. They were also agglutinated with standard serum of SS2. Biochemical characteristics of the three bacteria were tested using API 20 strep and analyzed by API software (version 3.3), results showed they were SS2. Four pairs of primer were designed, which were exactly matched the extracellular factor gene, muraminidase released protein gene, capsular polysaccharides gene and 16S rRNA gene respectively. These primers were used on polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the PCR products were 626bp, 885bp, 487bp and 297bp on agarose gel, respectively. Drug sensitivity test were also done and results showed that they were sensitive to cefazolin, clindamycin, erythromycin, levofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, penicillin-G, and vancomycin and resistive to tetracycline. Balb/c mice infected with the isolated SS2 strain showed swelling in stomach and intestine, cyanochroia at mouth and suggillation under skin, which were similar to the clinical features of patients. Streptococcus suis serotype 2 were also found on lung sheeting sample under microscope with Gram stain. Rabbits infected with the isolated SS2 showed the similar clinical features with mice.
TI  - Streptococcus suis endocarditis and colon carcinoma: a case report.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis has classically been associated with colorectal carcinomas in literature. Curiously enough, no other Streptococcus species have hitherto been associated with such a malignancy or any other tumors. This report presents a case of early-stage colorectal carcinoma diagnosed in a patient with infection with the related Streptococcus species S suis. A discussion of possible pathogenetic implications follows.
TI  - Iron incorporation in Streptococcus suis Dps-like peroxide resistance protein Dpr requires mobility in the ferroxidase center and leads to the formation of a ferrihydrite-like core.
AB  - The Dps-like peroxide resistance protein (Dpr) is a dodecameric protein that protects the human and swine pathogen Streptococcus suis from hydrogen peroxide by removing free Fe2+ from the cytosol. Subsequent oxidation of iron by Dpr results in the deposition of Fe3+ inside the protein's central cavity. Structural changes that occur in the ferroxidase center were studied by X-ray crystallography after soaking Dpr crystals with Fe2+ in the presence of sodium dithionite. Twelve iron-binding sites were identified with each site formed by residues Asp74 and Glu78 from one subunit, and Asp63, His47 and His59 from a 2-fold symmetry-related subunit. Compared to the iron-free Dpr, Asp74 and Glu78 were found to be the most flexible amino acid residues and able to adopt a variety of conformations in different subunits. The crystal structure of an Asp74Ala Dpr mutant soaked with a Fe2+ -solution revealed variations in the Asp63 position and no iron bound to the ferroxidase center. These results indicate an intrinsic flexibility in the active site that may be important for the catalytic reaction and subsequent nucleation events. Two iron cores with remarkably different features were identified in Dpr using X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Purified Dpr was found to have a small-size iron core with only approximately 16 iron atoms/dodecamer forming a ferritin-like ferrihydrite structure. Because of its size, this core represents the smallest iron core identified so far in ferritins and other Dps-like proteins. A large-size core (approximately 180 iron atoms/dodecamer) formed after incubating the protein with a ferrous solution shows differences in iron coordination compared to the small size core. Characterization of the two iron cores in Dpr could provide insights into nucleation events and the mechanism of iron core growth in the Dps family of proteins.
TI  - Reporter metabolite analysis of transcriptional profiles of a Staphylococcus aureus strain with normal phenotype and its isogenic hemB mutant displaying the small-colony-variant phenotype.
AB  - In this study, full-genome DNA microarrays based on the sequence of Staphylococcus aureus N315 were used to compare the transcriptome of a clinical S. aureus strain with a normal phenotype to that of its isogenic mutant with a stable small-colony-variant (SCV) phenotype (hemB::ermB). In addition to standard statistical analyses, systems biology advances were applied to identify reporter metabolites and to achieve a more detailed survey of genome-wide expression differences between the hemB mutant and its parental strain. Genes of enzymes involved in glycolytic and fermentative pathways were found to be up-regulated in the hemB mutant. Furthermore, our analyses allowed identification of additional differences between the normal-phenotype S. aureus and the SCV, most of which were related to metabolism. Profound differences were identified especially in purine biosynthesis as well as in arginine and proline metabolism. Of particular interest, a hypothetical gene of the Crp/Fnr family (SA2424) that is part of the arginine-deiminase (AD) pathway, whose homologue in Streptococcus suis is assumed to be involved in intracellular persistence, showed significantly increased transcription in the hemB mutant. The hemB mutant potentially uses the up-regulated AD pathway to produce ATP or (through ammonia production) to counteract the acidic environment that prevails intracellularly. Moreover, genes involved in capsular polysaccharide and cell wall synthesis were found to be significantly up-regulated in the hemB mutant and therefore potentially responsible for the changed cell morphology of SCVs. In conclusion, the identified differences may be responsible for the SCV phenotype and its association with chronic and persistent infections.
TI  - Streptococcus suis sequence type 7 outbreak, Sichuan, China.
AB  - An outbreak of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 emerged in the summer of 2005 in Sichuan Province, and sporadic infections occurred in 4 additional provinces of China. In total, 99 S. suis strains were isolated and analyzed in this study: 88 isolates from human patients and 11 from diseased pigs. We defined 98 of 99 isolates as pulse type I by using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis of SmaI-digested chromosomal DNA. Furthermore, multilocus sequence typing classified 97 of 98 members of the pulse type I in the same sequence type (ST), ST-7. Isolates of ST-7 were more toxic to peripheral blood mononuclear cells than ST-1 strains. S. suis ST-7, the causative agent, was a single-locus variant of ST-1 with increased virulence. These findings strongly suggest that ST-7 is an emerging, highly virulent S. suis clone that caused the largest S. suis outbreak ever described.
TI  - Meningitis and septicemia in a 7-week-old piglet caused by dual streptococcal infection.
AB  - A 7-week-old piglet was presented with a 2-hour history of neurological signs progressing to death. Necropsy, bacteriologic culture, and immunohistochemical staining indicated an unusual case of Streptococcus suis-like bacterial meningitis and S. suis type 3 septicemia. Management and control of this important bacterial disease are discussed.
TI  - Rational proteomics V: structure-based mutagenesis has revealed key residues responsible for substrate recognition and catalysis by the dehydrogenase and isomerase activities in human 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase type 1.
AB  - Mammalian 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase (3beta-HSD) is a member of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase. It is a key steroidogenic enzyme that catalyzes the first step of the multienzyme pathway conversion of circulating dehydroepiandrosterone and pregnenolone to active steroid hormones. A three dimensional model of a ternary complex of human 3beta-HSD type 1 (3beta-HSD_1) with an NAD cofactor and androstenedione product has been developed based upon X-ray structures of the ternary complex of E. coli UDP-galactose 4-epimerase (UDPGE) with an NAD cofactor and substrate (PDB_AC: 1NAH) and the ternary complex of human type 1 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17beta-HSD_1) with an NADP cofactor and androstenedione (PDB_AC: 1QYX). The dimeric structure of the enzyme was built from two monomer models of 3beta-HSD_1 by respective 3D superposition with A and B subunits of the dimeric structure of Streptococcus suis DTDP-D-glucose 4,6-dehydratase (PDB_AC: 1KEP). The 3D model structure of 3beta-HSD_1 has been successfully used for the rational design of mutagenic experiments to further elucidate the key substrate binding residues in the active site as well as the basis for dual function of the 3beta-HSD_1 enzyme. The structure based mutant enzymes, Asn100Ser, Asn100Ala, Glu126Leu, His232Ala, Ser322Ala and Asn323Leu, have been constructed and functionally characterized. The mutagenic experiments have confirmed the predicted roles of the His232 and Asn323 residues in recognition of the 17-keto group of the substrate and identified Asn100 and Glu126 residues as key residues that participate for the dehydrogenase and isomerization reactions, respectively.
TI  - Streptococcus suis in Hong Kong.
AB  - Streptococcus suis was isolated from 6.1% of raw pork meat from 3 of the 6 wet markets in 6 districts in Hong Kong. S. suis was particularly isolated in sites from the tongue, tonsil, bone, and tail, but not from lean meat/minced pork or internal organs. Isolates were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction using S. suis-specific primers, did not belong to serotype 2 using serotype 2-specific antiserum, and were clustered closely with other known serotypes by phylogenetic analysis. Ten strains from patients admitted to Hong Kong hospitals with sepsis or meningitis in the past 10 years all belonged to type 2, with closely related pulsed-field gel electrophoresis types that were distinct from the S. suis strains isolated from pork in this study. These methods may serve as useful tools in studying and enhancing our understanding of these infections in Hong Kong.
TI  - [An outbreak of human Streptococcus suis serotype 2 infections presenting with toxic shock syndrome in Sichuan, China].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In mid-July 2005, five patients presented with septic shock to a hospital in Ziyang city in Sichuan, China, to identify the etiology of the unknown reason disease, an epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory study were conducted. METHODS: An enhanced surveillance program were established in Sichuan, the following activities were introduced: active case finding in Sichuan of (a) laboratory diagnosed Streptococcus suis infection and (b) clinically diagnosed probable cases with exposure history; supplemented by (c) monitoring reports on meningococcal meningitis. Streptococcus suis serotype 2 infection was confirmed by culture and biochemical reactions, followed by sequencing for specific genes for serotype and virulence factors. RESULTS: From June 10 to August 21, 2005, 68 laboratory confirmed cases of human Streptococcus suis infections were reported. All were villagers who gave a history of direct exposure to deceased or sick pigs in their backyards where slaughtering was performed. Twenty six (38%) presented with toxic shock syndrome of which 15 (58%) died. Other presentations were septicaemia or meningitis. All isolates were tested positive for genes for tuf, species-specific 16S rRNA, cps2J, mrp, ef and sly. There were 136 clinically diagnosed probable cases with similar exposure history but incomplete laboratory investigations. CONCLUSION: An outbreak of human Streptococcus suis serotype 2 infections occurred in villagers after direct exposure to deceased or sick pigs in Sichuan. Prohibition of slaughtering in backyards brought the outbreak to a halt. A virulent strain of the bacteria is speculated to be in circulation, and is responsible for the unusual presentation of toxic shock syndrome with high case fatality.
TI  - Surface plasmon resonance biosensors for detection of pathogenic microorganisms:  strategies to secure food and environmental safety.
AB  - This review describes the exploitation of exclusively optical surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensors for the direct and indirect detection of pathogenic microorganisms in food chains and the environment. Direct detection is, in most cases, facilitated by the use of defined monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies raised against (a part of) the target pathogenic microorganisms. The antibodies were immobilized to a solid phase of the sensor to capture the microbe from the sample. Alternatively, antibodies were used in an inhibition-like assay involving incubation with the target organism prior to analysis of nonbound antibodies. The free immunoglobins were screened on a sensor surface coated with either purified antigens or with Fc or Fab binding antibodies. Discussed examples of these approaches are the determination of Escherichia coli O1 57:H7, Salmonella spp., and Listeria monocytogenes. Another direct detection strategy involved SPR analysis of polymerase chain reaction products of Shiga toxin-2 genes reporting the presence of E. coli O157:H7 in human stool. Metabolic products have been exploited as biomarkers for the presence of a microbial agent, such as enterotoxin B and a virulence factor for the occurrence of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus suis, respectively. Indirect detection, on the other hand, is performed by analysis of a humoral immune response of the infected animal or human. By immobilization of specific antigenic structures, infections with Herpes simplex and human immunodeficiency viruses, Salmonella and Treponema pallidum bacteria, and Schistosoma spp. parasites were revealed using human, avian, and porcine sera and avian eggs. Bound antibodies were easily isotyped using an SPR biosensor to reveal the infection history of the individual. Discussed studies show the recent recognition of the suitability of this type of instrument for (rapid) detection of health-threatening microbes to food and environmental microbial safety.
TI  - Cell death, caspase activation, and HMGB1 release of porcine choroid plexus epithelial cells during Streptococcus suis infection in vitro.
AB  - The choroid plexus epithelium constitutes the structural basis of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. We previously demonstrated that Streptococcus suis (S. suis), a relevant cause of bacterial meningitis in pigs and humans, affects porcine choroid plexus epithelial cell (PCPEC) barrier function and integrity. We now characterized PCPEC cell death and investigated whether apoptosis or necrosis is responsible for the cytotoxicity after infection with different S. suis isolates. We found S. suis strain-dependent histone associated DNA-fragments quantified by ELISA. This response could partially be inhibited by cylcoheximide, cytochalasin D, dexamethasone, herbimycin A, but most effectively by the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk. We further detected caspase-3 and -9 activation after infection with all tested S. suis isolates that could also be blocked by zVAD-fmk. However, we found a significantly stronger caspase activity with the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine. All tested S. suis isolates induced loss of cell viability in PCPEC as shown with the Live/Dead assay, but strain dependent lactate dehydrogenase-release. Both parameters could not be influenced by zVAD-fmk. Immunostaining showed release of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein from the nucleus, indicative of necrosis. Transmission electron microscopy showed cell swelling, cytoplasmic vacuolization, loss of membrane integrity, nuclear fermentation but no nuclear condensation, indices for a primarily necrotic cell morphology. Taken together, our findings indicate that S. suis causes cell death in PCPEC by different mechanisms. Although apoptosis may be involved in the process of PCPEC cell death, necrosis seems to be the predominant mechanism. Through inflammation in the choroid plexus during bacterial meningitis, the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier function will be compromised.
TI  - The porcine acute phase protein response to acute clinical and subclinical experimental infection with Streptococcus suis.
AB  - The pig acute phase protein (APP) response to experimental Streptococcus suis (S. suis) infection was mapped by the measurement of the positive APPs C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA), haptoglobin (Hp) and major acute phase protein (pig-MAP) and the negative APPs albumin and apolipoprotein (Apo) A-I. The aim was to elucidate the differences in the acute phase behaviour of the individual APPs during a typical bacterial septicaemic infection. Pigs were inoculated subcutaneously with live S. suis serotype 2 and blood was sampled before and on various days post inoculation (p.i.), until the pigs were killed and autopsied on day 14 p.i. Clinical signs (fever and lameness) were observed in four of the five inoculated pigs from day 2 p.i., and these pigs also had arthritic lesions at autopsy. CRP and SAA showed fast increases in serum concentrations, CRP being elevated from days 1 to 12 p.i. and peaking at 10 times the day 0-levels on day 1 p.i. SAA rose quickly to peak levels of 30-40 times the day 0-level on days 1-2 and returned to pre-inoculation level on day 5 p.i. Hp and pig-MAP showed slightly slower responses, both peaking around 5 days p.i. Hp was increased throughout the experiment with maximum levels around 10 times the day 0-levels, and pig-MAP was elevated on days 1-12 p.i. with peak levels of around seven times the day 0-levels. Apo A-I was decreased from days 1 to 8 and showed minimum levels of about 40% of day 0-levels around 1-2 days p.i. No clear pattern of changes in albumin levels could be identified. One pig, showing clinical signs on day 2 only, also showed an APP response, although of a relatively short duration, whereas three pigs presenting clinical signs for several days had a more protracted acute phase response. Remarkably, the one pig showing no clinical signs and no arthritic lesions showed an APP response comparable to that of the other, clinically affected pigs. Thus, both acute clinical and subclinical S. suis infection could be revealed by the measurement of one or more of the APPs CRP, SAA, Hp, pig-MAP and Apo A-I. The combined measurement of two or three APPs, including proteins with slow and fast kinetics, should be used to achieve the highest sensitivity for the detection of ongoing S. suis infection during a prolonged time period. A diagnostic tool based on such APP-measurements could considerably improve strategic control procedures for this important infection.

AB  
TI  - Phagocytosis and killing of Streptococcus suis by porcine neutrophils.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is an important swine pathogen responsible for diverse infections, mainly meningitis. Virulence factors and the pathogenesis of infection are not well understood. Neutrophils may play an important role in the pathogenesis of infection given that infiltration by neutrophils and mononuclear cells are frequently observed in lesions caused by S. suis. The objective of this work was to study the interactions between S. suis serotype 2 and porcine neutrophils. Results showed that suilysin is toxic to neutrophils and this could help S. suis evade innate immunity. Moreover, suilysin appears to affect complement-dependent killing by decreasing the opsonization of S. suis and the bactericidal capacity of neutrophils. Our results confirm that capsule polysaccharide protects S. suis against killing and phagocytosis by neutrophils. We also showed that the presence of specific IgG against S. suis serotype 2 promoted killing by neutrophils, indicating that the induction of a strong humoral response is beneficial for clearance of this pathogen.
TI  - Human Streptococcus suis outbreak, Sichuan, China.
AB  - From mid-July to the end of August 2005, a total of 215 cases of human Streptococcus suis infections, 66 of which were laboratory confirmed, were reported in Sichuan, China. All infections occurred in backyard farmers who were directly exposed to infection during the slaughtering process of pigs that had died of unknown causes or been killed for food because they were ill. Sixty-one (28%) of the farmers had streptococcal toxic shock syndrome; 38 (62%) of them died. The other illnesses reported were sepsis (24%) and meningitis (48%) or both. All isolates tested positive for genes for tuf, species-specific 16S rRNA, cps2J, mrp, ef, and sly. A single strain of S. suis caused the outbreak, as shown by the identification of a single ribotype. The high death ratio was of concern; prohibiting backyard slaughtering ended the outbreak.
TI  - Proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine modulation by Streptococcus suis in a whole-blood culture system.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important swine and human pathogen. Inflammation, a hallmark of S. suis infection, is thought to be responsible for most clinical signs of meningitis, septicaemia and sudden death. In this work, using a porcine whole blood model, S. suis serotype 2 was shown to trigger the release of several pro-inflammatory cytokines as evaluated by reverse transcriptase-PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Although individual variations were observed among different S. suis strains, no correlations were observed between the strain origin/phenotype and cytokine levels. Live bacteria induced higher tumour necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) and IL-6 levels than did heat-killed bacteria. In contrast, heat-killed bacteria stimulated higher levels of IL-8 and monocyte chemotactic protein one (MCP-1). The bacterial cell wall was observed to be the major cytokine-inducting components, whereas capsule expression was important for MCP-1 activation. The presence of specific antibodies suppressed bacterial growth resulting in significantly reduced levels of cytokine production. Thus, antibody-mediated bacterial phagocytosis combined with suppressed inflammation may be beneficial for infection control strategies. We provide first evidence of S.suis-induction of pro-inflammatory swine cytokines and demonstrate the strength and relevance of the whole blood culture systems in the investigation of S. suis modulation of cytokine production.
TI  - Streptococcus suis infection: a series of 41 cases from Chiang Mai University Hospital.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were (1) to assess the clinical manifestations, treatment, and outcome of Streptococcus suis infection in adult patients in northern Thailand, (2) to evaluate the anti-microbial sensitivity pattern and (3) to determine the predicting factors of high mortality rate. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted at Chiang Mai University Hospital from May 2000 to December 2002. Anti-microbial susceptibility test was performed by agar disk diffusion and the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) by E-test. RESULTS: Forty-one patients (32 men and nine women, mean age 51 years) with S. suis infection were identified. Three patients had a history of exposure to pig or pork and one patient had a history of raw beef consumption. Clinical manifestations included infective endocarditis, meningitis, sepsis, spondylodiscitis, and endophthalmitis in 16, 13, 10, 1, and 1 patients, respectively. The overall mortality rate was 19.5%. On univariate analysis, low serum albumin, high serum total bilirubin, low platelet, and rapid onset of illness were significantly correlated with high mortality rate. All isolates were sensitive to penicillin (mean MIC90=0.027 microg/ml). CONCLUSIONS: S. suis infection is not uncommon in northern Thailand. High suspicion and early detection are important and could lead to the successful treatment.
TI  - Molecular characterization of Streptococcus suis strains by 16S-23S intergenic spacer polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.
AB  - We developed a new molecular method of typing Streptococcus suis based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of a large fragment of rRNA genes, including a part of the 16S and 23S genes and the 16S-23S intergenic spacer region (ISR), followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis with RsaI or MboII endonuclease. The 16S-23S ISRs of 5 S. suis isolates were sequenced and compared. Size and sequence polymorphisms were observed between the S735 reference strain and the 4 wild-type strains. The genetic relationships between 138 independent S. suis strains belonging to various serotypes, isolated from swine or human cases, were determined. The discriminatory power of the method was > 0.95, the threshold value for interpreting typing results with confidence (0.954 with RsaI and 0.984 with RsaI plus MboII). The in vitro reproducibility was 100%. The strains isolated from humans were less genetically diverse than the strains isolated from pigs. For the first time, 2 molecular patterns (R6, M9) were significantly associated with S. suis serotype 2 strains. This genetic tool could be valuable in distinguishing individual isolates of S. suis during epidemiologic investigations.
TI  - Streptococcus suis meningitis with ventriculoperitoneal shunt infection and spondylodiscitis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is a zoonotic pathogen which causes meningitis, bacteremia, and endocarditis in pigs. Human infection is rare and often presents as meningitis with the sequela of permanent deafness and endocarditis. Previous cases were reported from pig-rearing countries such as Holland and Hong Kong. We report a 55-year-old bedridden man with S. suis meningitis complicated with ventriculoperitoneal shunt infection and lumbar spine spondylodiscitis. He presented with fever, delirium, neck stiffness, lower leg weakness and sudden onset hearing loss for several days. He was successfully treated with intravenous antibiotics, ventriculoperitoneal shunt replacement, lumbar spinal laminotomy and discectomy. Cerebrospinal fluid culture initially misidentified the organism as Streptococcus acidominimus, and S. suis was later identified by 16S rRNA sequencing. Misidentification of the microbiological findings may lead to a failure to correctly diagnose this disease. S. suis meningitis should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients with meningitis and sudden hearing loss.
TI  - Invasive disease and toxic shock due to zoonotic Streptococcus suis: an emerging  infection in the East?
AB  
TI  - Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome caused by Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S. suis 2, SS2) is a major zoonotic pathogen that causes only sporadic cases of meningitis and sepsis in humans. Most if not all cases of Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) that have been well-documented to date were associated with the non-SS2 group A streptococcus (GAS). However, a recent large-scale outbreak of SS2 in Sichuan Province, China, appeared to be caused by more invasive deep-tissue infection with STSS, characterized by acute high fever, vascular collapse, hypotension, shock, and multiple organ failure. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We investigated this outbreak of SS2 infections in both human and pigs, which took place from July to August, 2005, through clinical observation and laboratory experiments. Clinical and pathological characterization of the human patients revealed the hallmarks of typical STSS, which to date had only been associated with GAS infection. Retrospectively, we found that this outbreak was very similar to an earlier outbreak in Jiangsu Province, China, in 1998. We isolated and analyzed 37 bacterial strains from human specimens and eight from pig specimens of the recent outbreak, as well as three human isolates and two pig isolates from the 1998 outbreak we had kept in our laboratory. The bacterial isolates were examined using light microscopy observation, pig infection experiments, multiplex-PCR assay, as well as restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) and multiple sequence alignment analyses. Multiple lines of evidence confirmed that highly virulent strains of SS2 were the causative agents of both outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS: We report, to our knowledge for the first time, two outbreaks of STSS caused by SS2, a non-GAS streptococcus. The 2005 outbreak was associated with 38 deaths out of 204 documented human cases; the 1998 outbreak with 14 deaths out of 25 reported human cases. Most of the fatal cases were characterized by STSS; some of them by meningitis or severe septicemia. The molecular mechanisms underlying these human STSS outbreaks in human beings remain unclear and an objective for further study.
TI  - Human Streptococcus suis meningitis in the United States.
AB  
TI  - [Streptococcus suis infection--clinical manifestations].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Streptococcus suis is a bacterium causing a disease in pigs and rarely in humans. This zoonosis is mostly found as a sporadic disease in individuals that were in contact with the affected or infected pigs: farmers, veterinarians and workers engaged in fresh pork processing. It is assumed that the bacterium enters the body through a cut abrasion in the skin. Initially, the condition resembles a flu, followed by signs of bacteriemia and sepsis. The most frequent clinical manifestation of Streptococcus suis infection is meningitis, leading to hearing loss in over 75% of patients, and subsequent arthritis, endophtalmitis, endocarditis and pneumonia. Toxic shock syndrome with hemorhagic manifestations rarely develops. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study included five male patients aged 22 to 63 years treated in the Intensive Care Unit of the Institute of Infectious and Tropical Diseases in Belgrade, due to Streptococcus suis infection. The aim of this study was to point to the existence of this bacteria in our environment, to describe clinical manifestations of the disease and to point out the importance of its prevention. RESULTS: All patients had epidemiological evidence of being in contact with pork meat. There were no data about diseased pigs. The estimated incubation period was 4 to 8 days. All patients had meningeal signs. Clinical symptoms included shivering, fever, vomiting, headache, malaise, vertigo and tinitus. Three patients presented with alerterd level of awarrness. Four patients developed very severe bilateral hearing impairment, whereas one endophtalmtis and one developed endocarditis. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was opalescent in four patients, and only one patient presented with clear CSF. CSF examination showed typical changes characteristic for bacterial meningitis. Streptoccocus suis was isolated in CSF in all patients, and in one patient the bacteria was isolated in blood as well. All patients underwent treatement with II and III generation cephalosporins and one with one aminoglycosides. All patients were cured, but 4 of them developed sequelae like permanent sensorineural deafness and mild ataxia. CONCLUSIONS: Streptococcus suis infection is present as a zoonosis in pigs, while humans are contracted occasionaly, most frequently related to occupational risk. In cases with bacterial meningitis with sepsis and hearing loss, Streptococcus suis infections must be suspected. Effective prevention requires collaboration between epidemiologists, veterinarians and human medicine physicians.
TI  - [Zoonotic importance of selected species of Gram-positive bacteria.]
AB  - Zoonoses continue to play a signicant role in both human and veterinary medicine. Their eradication is difficult and some authors are convinced of their growing importance. Among the pathogens of infectious diseases transmissible from animals to man are several gram-positive bacteria. The authors focus on three agents that present a risk in three different areas-alimentary infections (Listeria monocytogenes), professional infections (Streptococcus suis) and infections of breeders of so-called pet animals (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus intermedius). The paper analyses the risk of human infections from animal sources and briefly informs on the present incidence of pathogens in animals and/or raw materials of animal origin in the catchment area of the State Veterinary Institute in Olomouc, Moravia.
TI  - [Cloning and prokaryotic expression of truncated muramidase-released protein gene of human Streptococcus suis type 2].
AB  - AIM: To clone and express the truncated Habb mrp gene of human Streptococcus suis type 2 (S.suis 2) and detect its activity. METHODS: A pair of primers based on S.suis 2 mrp gene were schemed out. The turncated mrp (tmrp)gene of S.suis 2 strain Habb isolated from diseased person in Haian, Jiangsu province was cloned and analyzed. The prokaryotic expression plasmid pGEX4T-2-tmrp was constructed.The expression of recombinant protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST) was induced in E.coli TG1. The fusion protein (tMRP-GST) was purified by affinity chromatography, and the GST was cut from tMRP-GST with thrombin protease to gain the truncated MRP (tMRP) antigen. The activity of recombinant protein was analyzed by Western blot. RESULTS: Sequence analysis showed that the length of the truncated mrp was 957 bp. The prokaryotic expressed production was a fusion protein, whose molecular weight was about 61 kD, and the molecular weight of the purified tMRP protein was about 35 kD. Western blot analysis showed that tMRP-GST and tMRP were detected specifically by MRP antiserum on nitrocellulose membrane. CONCLUSION: The truncated mrp gene of human S.suis 2 strain Habb is successfully cloned, and the high expression of the functional recombinant protein is achieved in the prokaryotic system, which facilitates the further studies on the bio-function and immunology.

TI  - [Detection of virulence-associated factors of Streptococcus suis by multiplex PCR assay].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To rapidly and sensitively detect the four virulence-associated factors of Streptococcus suis, a multiplex PCR was developed. METHODS: In the process of this reaction, four distinct DNA targets were amplified. One target was based on the serotype 2 (and 1/2) specific cps gene and the others were based on Streptococcus suis mrp, epf (epf*) and sly gene, encoding the MRP, EF(EF*) and Sly proteins of Streptococcus suis. 72 isolates, which including 48 strains of Streptococcus suis and 24 strains of negative control, and 49 clinical specimens were detected by the multiplex PCR assay. RESULTS: All PCR products were detected by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gels. With the 48 Streptococcus suis strains, the positive detection rates of cps2+, mrp+, epf+, epf*+ and sly+ were 16/48, 14/48, 12/48, 3/48 and 26/48,respectively. The results were confirmed by bacteriological examination. There were no specific amplification products including 49 clinical specimens and 24 negative control strains. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that multiplex PCR was a highly specific and sensitive diagnostic tool for the detection of virulence-associated factors of streptococcus suis.
TI  - [Matched case-control study for risk factors of human Streptococcus suis infection in Sichuan Province, China].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the potential risk factors of human infecting with Streptococcus suis. METHODS: 1: M matched case-control study was conducted. 29 human cases of Streptococcus suis infection in the early phase were included in the case group, Patients' family members, neighbors and peoples who had worked together with patients to handle deceased or sick pigs in the last week were recruited as matched controls. There were 147 controls in total. Both cases and controls received questionnaire investigation including the ways to contact sick/dead pigs. Conditional logistic regression was employed to analyze matching data. RESULTS: According to the results of multivariate analysis, slaughtering (OR = 11.978, 95% CI: 3.355-42.756), carcasses cutting and processing (OR = 3.008, 95% CI: 1.022-8.849) sick/dead pigs were associated with cases related to human Streptococcus suis infection. The attributable risk proportion were 91.65% and 66.76% respectively. The other types of exposures to sick/ dead pigs, including feeding, selling, burying and eating, were not associated with the human Streptococcus suis infection in our study population. CONCLUSION: Slaughtering, carcasses cutting and processing sick/dead pigs were important risky behavior for humans to be infected by Streptococcus suis.
TI  - [Anlysis on features of dead cases with human Streptococcus suis infections].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and epidemiological features of dead cases with human Streptococcus suis infections, and to find the target population for preventing death and the related indicators. METHODS: Epidemiological investigation on human Streptococcus suis infections was implemented used unified questionnaires. Analysis on dead cases and survival cases (as contrast) was done. RESULTS: The population with highest fatality rate was in 40-49 age group. 97.37% of dead cases had toxic shock syndrome. The mean interval from onset to admission was 0.76 days, and the mean course was 2.11 days. The progression among dead cases was faster than that among survival cases. Chief clinical manifestations of dead cases that are more frequent than survival cases are purpura (73.68%), diarrhea (50.0%), dyspnea (21.05%), conjunctival congestion (34.21%), etc. Renal impairment and liver involvement in dead cases were more significant than that in survival cases. No significant difference between mean incubation period, exposure rates of main risk factors in dead cases and in survival cases was found. CONCLUSION: Preventing toxic shock syndrome might reduce the fatality rate. The target population for preventing death is aged > or = 40. Liver function and renal function testing might be indicators for monitoring the progression of human Streptococcus suis infections.

TI  - Virulence-associated gene profiling of Streptococcus suis isolates by PCR.
AB  - Definition of virulent Streptococcus suis strains is controversial. One successful approach for identification of virulent European strains is differentiation of capsular serotypes (or the corresponding cps types) and subsequent detection of virulence-associated factors, namely the extracellular factor (EF, epf), the muramidase-released protein (MRP, mrp) and the hemolysin suilysin (SLY, sly). In this work we present a novel multiplex PCR (MP-PCR) and an mrp variant PCR for identification and characterization of virulent S. suis strains. These new methods were used to identify association of disease with particular profiles of virulence-associated genes. The MP-PCR allowed identification of S. suis through detection of the housekeeping gene gdh, differentiation of four cps types (1, 2, 7 and 9), and detection of epf, mrp, sly and arcA (arginine deiminase from S. suis). Furthermore, this study describes the first PCR assay for differentiation of at least six mrp variants. Expression of the corresponding size variants of MRP was shown for four of the six mrp variants, but was undetectable for the two larger mrp variants in the particular strains investigated. The results of this study suggest that cps7 strains are associated with pneumonia and that variation of mrp is very pronounced among these strains. Gene profiles of invasive, pneumonia and carrier S. suis isolates by combination of PCR assays allowed differentiation of 24 different genotypes among cps1, 2, 7 and 9 strains. Forty-five percent of the invasive S. suis diseases investigated in this study were caused by only two of these genotypes, namely cps2/mrp+/epf+/sly+ and cps9/mrp(*)/epf-/sly+. Thus, this study demonstrates for the first time a uniform profile of the particular virulence-associated genes for the vast majority of the investigated invasive cps9 strains.

TI  - Quantitative susceptibility of Streptococcus suis strains isolated from diseased  pigs in seven European countries to antimicrobial agents licensed in veterinary medicine.
AB  - The susceptibility of Streptococcus suis strains (n=384) isolated from diseased pigs in seven European countries to 10 antimicrobial agents was determined. For that purpose a microbroth dilution method was used according to CLSI recommendations. The following antimicrobial agents were tested: ceftiofur, cefquinome, enrofloxacin, florfenicol, gentamicin, penicillin, spectinomycin, tetracycline, tilmicosin and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole. Using breakpoints established by CLSI for veterinary pathogens, all strains were susceptible to ceftiofur, florfenicol, enrofloxacin and penicillin. MIC-90 values of these antibiotics were < or = 0.03, 0.5, 2 and < or = 0.13 microg/mL, respectively. A low degree of resistance was observed for gentamicin (1.3%), spectinomycin (3.6%) and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole (6.0%). MIC-90 values of these antibiotics were 8, 16 and 2 microg/mL, respectively. A high level of resistance was observed for tetracycline (75.1%). A MIC-90 value of 64 microg/mL was found for this antibiotic. Serotype-associated differences in MIC-90 values were observed for tetracycline, tilmicosin and trimethoprim/suphamethoxazole.
TI  - Structure, regulation, and putative function of the arginine deiminase system of  Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important cause of infectious diseases in young pigs. Little is known about the virulence factors or protective antigens of S. suis. Recently, we have identified two proteins of the arginine deiminase system (ADS) of S. suis, which were temperature induced and expressed on the streptococcal surface (N. Winterhoff, R. Goethe, P. Gruening, M. Rohde, H. Kalisz, H. E. Smith, and P. Valentin-Weigand, J. Bacteriol. 184:6768-6776, 2002). In the present study, we analyzed the complete ADS of S. suis. Due to their homologies to the recently published S. gordonii ADS genes, the genes for arginine deiminase, ornithine carbamoyl-transferase, and carbamate kinase, which were previously designated adiS, octS, and ckS, respectively, were renamed arcA, arcB, and arcC, respectively. Our data revealed that arcA, arcB, and arcC of the S. suis ADS are transcribed from an operon (arcABC operon). Additionally, putative ADS-associated genes were cloned and sequenced which, however, did not belong to the arcABC operon. These were the flpS gene upstream of the arcABC operon with homology to the flp transcription regulator of S. gordonii and the arcD, arcT, arcH, and argR genes downstream of the arcABC operon with high homologies to a putative arginine-ornithine antiporter, a putative dipeptidase of S. gordonii, a putative beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase of S. pneumoniae, and a putative arginine repressor of S. gordonii, respectively. The transcriptional start point of the arcABC operon was determined, and promoter analysis provided evidence that multiple factors contribute to the regulation of the ADS. Thus, a putative binding site for a transcription regulator of the Crp/Fnr family, an ArgR-binding site, and two cis-acting catabolite response elements were identified in the promoter-operator region of the operon. Consistent with this, we could demonstrate that the ADS of S. suis is inducible by arginine and reduced O2 tension and subject to carbon catabolite repression. Furthermore, comparing an arcA knockout mutant in which expression of the three operon-encoded proteins was abolished with the parental wild-type strain showed that the arcABC operon of S. suis contributes to survival under acidic conditions.
TI  - Identification of a surface protein of Streptococcus suis and evaluation of its immunogenic and protective capacity in pigs.
AB  - A Streptococcus suis surface protein reacting with convalescent-phase sera from pigs clinically infected by S. suis type 2 was identified. The apparent 110-kDa protein, designated Sao, exhibits typical features of membrane-anchored surface proteins of gram-positive bacteria, such as a signal sequence and an LPVTG membrane anchor motif. In spite of high identity with the partially sequenced genomes of S. suis Canadian strain 89/1591 and European strain P1/7, Sao does not share significant homology with other known sequences. However, a conserved avirulence domain that is often found in plant pathogens has been detected. Electron microscopy using an Sao-specific antiserum has confirmed the surface location of the Sao protein on S. suis. The Sao-specific antibody reacts with cell lysates of 28 of 33 S. suis serotypes and 25 of 26 serotype 2 isolates in immunoblots, suggesting its high conservation in S. suis species. The immunization of piglets with recombinant Sao elicits a significant humoral antibody response. However, the antibody response is not reflected in protection of pigs that are intratracheally challenged with a virulent strain in our conventional vaccination model.
TI  - [Determination of fibronectin-binding region of FBPS of Streptococcus suis type 2].
AB  - Fusion expression plasmid pFBPS, pFBPS (7 - 82), pFBPS (7 - 165) and pFBPS3 (87 - 320) of Streptococcus suis type strain HA9801 were generated by cloning different fragments of fbps amplified from pMD-T-FBPS by PCR into plasmid pET-32a(+). It has been confirmed that the recombinant proteins, FBPS, FBPS(87 -320), and FBPS(7 - 167), which are expressed by recombinant plasmid pFBPS, pFBPS(87 - 320) and pFBPS(7 - 165), respectively, bound human fibronectin by ligand affinity Western blot assay. The results indicate the primary fibronectin-binding domain of FBPS lies within 87 - 165 amino acid residues region.
TI  - Upregulation of prostaglandin E2 and matrix metalloproteinase 9 production by human macrophage-like cells: synergistic effect of capsular material and cell wall from Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis, an early colonizer of the upper respiratory tract, is a major swine pathogen worldwide that can cause meningitis, arthritis, pneumonia, and septicemia. While numerous studies on potential virulence factors of S. suis have been carried out over the past decade, the exact mechanisms by which this bacterium invades the host and migrates through the blood brain barrier (BBB) remain unclear. In the study presented here, we show that whole cells of S. suis were able to upregulate the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) by U937 human monoblastic cells differentiated into adherent macrophages in a dose- and time-dependent way. Capsular material and cell wall of S. suis were tested to determine which component was responsible for the induction of PGE2 and MMP-9 production by macrophages. The capsular material, even at low concentrations, strongly stimulated the production of PGE2 and MMP-9. While no stimulation was observed with the purified cell wall material, combining it with the capsular material resulted in a significant synergic effect on PGE2 and MMP-9 production. S. suis-mediated MMP-9 and PGE2 production by human macrophages may play a critical role in BBB disruption and tissue destruction.

TI  - Adherence of Streptococcus suis to porcine endothelial cells.
AB  - Streptococcus suis can cause invasive diseases in pigs and humans, such as meningitis or arthritis. Adherence to and invasion of endothelial cells might represent important steps in survival and spread of S. suis within the host. We tested in vitro adherence and invasion of S. suis strains using a porcine brain microvascular and aortal endothelial cell line. Four S. suis strains were tested with and without prior treatment with porcine serum containing anti-S. suis antibodies. Strains included a capsular serotype 2 strain and its non-encapsulated isogenic mutant strain, as well as two non-typeable (NT) strains, which expressed no capsule under our experimental conditions. Strains adhered to both cell lines to different extents depending on encapsulation and pre-treatment with porcine immune serum. The serotype 2 strain showed almost no adherence, whereas the non-encapsulated mutant strain adhered strongly. Similarly, both NT strains adhered substantially better than the serotype 2 strain. Pre-treatment of bacteria with porcine serum increased adherence of the encapsulated serotype 2 strain and decreased adherence of the non-encapsulated strains. None of the strains was able to efficiently invade either of the two cell lines, except for one NT strain, which showed a very low extend of invasion. Our results suggest that S. suis can adhere to but not invade porcine endothelial cells, and that this interaction may involve different bacterial surface structures, such as capsular polysaccharides and/or binding sites for serum components.
TI  - [Fusion and apoptosis of epithelial cells induced by muramidase released protein  of Streptococcus suis type 2].
AB  - The pathogenic role of muramidase released protein (MRP), a virulence factor of Streptococcus suis type 2 (SS2) is poorly understood. The purified MRP was co-incubated with HEp-2 cells to determine the effect of MRP on epithelial cells. Under light microscope, two principal morphologic changes were observed. Firstly, the cells were fused to form syncytia and a apoptosis followed. Secondly, single cell was also induced to apoptosis at high level as 18%, which was verified by transmission electron microscopy and flow cytometry. It showed that MRP alone was capable of a virulence factor of SS2.
TI  - [Chemical modification of Streptococcus suis type 2 haemolysin].
AB  - The haemolysin of Streptococcus suis type 2 Jiangsu isolate was purified. Effects of protein modification reagents on the haemolysin activity were detected. The haemolysin was not affected by PCMB, succinic anhydride (SA), EDC, and N-AI modification, and it indicated that sulfhudryl groups, amino groups, carboxyl groups and tyrosine residues were not essential to haemolysin activity. The haemolysin activity was significantly decreased after NBS, DEPC, 2, 3-Diacetyl, H2O2 modification and was greatly increased after DTT modification. The results indicated that tryptophane residues, histidine residues, arginine residues and disulfides groups seemed to be essential to the haemolysin activity.
TI  - Serological characterization of Haemophilus parasuis isolates from China.
AB  - From September 2002 to December 2004, a total of 281 strains of Haemophilus parasuis were isolated from 17 provinces of China. All these isolates were serotyped by both the gel diffusion (GD) and the indirect haemagglutination (IHA) tests. By combining the GD and IHA results, serovar 4 (24.2%) and serovar 5 (19.2%) were the most prevalent serovars, followed by serovars 13 (12.5%), 14 (7.1%) and 12 (6.8%), while 12.1% of the isolates could not be assigned to a serovar (nontypable). A comparison of the number of isolates obtained from the respiratory tract of swine without polyserositis with those obtained from swine with polyserositis revealed an increased frequency of serovar 4 and a significantly decreased frequency of serovar 13 among isolates from the respiratory tract of swine without polyserositis, whereas the frequency of isolation of serovars 5, 12, 14 and nontypable from swine with or without polyserositis were similar. Co-infection of H. parasuis and other bacterial agents was studied in 183 cases examined from June 2003 to December 2004. Streptococcus suis (30.6%; 56), Escherichia coli (21.9%; 40), Bordetella bronchiseptica (21.3%; 39) and Pasteurella multocida (14.2%; 26) were the bacterial agents frequently co-isolated with H. parasuis in China.
TI  - Chronic meningitis in Thailand. Clinical characteristics, laboratory data and outcome in patients with specific reference to tuberculosis and cryptococcosis.
AB  - The charts of 114 consecutive patients with chronic meningitis admitted to a general hospital in Bangkok, Thailand, between 1993 and 1999 were retrospectively reviewed. The most common causative agents were Cryptococcus neoformans (54%) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (37%). HIV and other underlying diseases had a major impact on the presentation of chronic cryptococcal meningitis patients. Compared to HIV-negative cryptococcal meningitis patients (21%), HIV-positives (79%) had a significantly lower incidence of focal signs (p = 0.02), hydrocephalus (p = 0.03) and seizures (p = 0.001) during hospital stay, furthermore, a lower leucocyte level, a significantly higher glucose level (p = 0.02) and a lower protein level (p = 0.03) in the first cerebrospinal fluid examination. Of the 43 patients with chronic tuberculous meningitis, only 3 were HIV positive. Focal neurologic deficits were found more frequently in tuberculous meningitis patients (p = 0.001) when compared to cryptococcal meningitis patients without HIV. Cerebral infarction on cerebral CT was indicative of tuberculous meningitis. Cryptococcal meningitis patients with HIV infection had a worse outcome compared to non-AIDS patients. Advanced stage of the disease on admission, decreased level of consciousness prior to and on the admission day and raised intracranial pressure above 40 cm H(2)O at any given time were predictive of a poor outcome in tuberculous meningitis patients.
TI  - Streptococcus suis, Streptococcus mitis, what is the problem?
AB  
TI  - Streptococcus suis infection.
AB  - A recent outbreak of Streptococcus suis infection associated with the slaughter,  preparation or consumption of pigs in Sichuan, China has led to concerns that similar outbreaks could occur in other Asian countries. Although the pig farming industry is flourishing in Taiwan, reports of S. suis infection remain rare. We report 2 cases of S. suis meningitis successfully treated with ceftriaxone and penicillin. Previous reports of S. suis infection from the English literature are reviewed and the clinical data of cases reported in Asian and European countries are summarized. In Europe, there was good correlation between clinical disease and porcine contact, while few cases in Asia reported this association. Meningitis remained the most common presentation of infection in both areas (84.6% and 75.2%, respectively), followed by sepsis (15.4% and 18.6%, respectively), which had a higher mortality rate, particularly for splenectomized patients. Other clinical presentations included enteritis, arthritis, endocarditis, pneumonia, spondylodiscitis, endophthalmitis, uveitis and peritonitis. Deafness was a distinct sequelae (50.5% in Europe and 51.9% in Asia) after recovery from S. suis infection, especially in patients with meningitis. Not all commercial identification systems for streptococci could offer adequate speciation for S. suis. When viridans group streptococci are isolated from patients with meningitis and sepsis, prompt and correct identification of isolates to the species level should be performed, especially in areas with a high prevalence of S. suis diseases.
TI  - Comparison and transferability of the erm (B) genes between human and farm animal streptococci.
AB  - To obtain better insights into the possible exchange of resistance genes between  human and animal streptococci, the sequences of the erm (B) genes of streptococcal isolates from humans, pigs, pork carcasses, chickens, and calves were compared. Identical erm (B) gene sequences were present in strains from humans, pigs, pork carcasses, and calves. During in vitro mating experiments, the erm (B) gene was exchanged between porcine Streptococcus suis and human S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, and S. oralis strains. The presence of different tetracycline resistance genes and the int Tn 1545 gene was determined in animal streptococci carrying the erm (B) gene. Although tet(M) and int Tn 1545 genes were detected in 24% of the porcine and pork carcass streptococcal strains, the tet(O) gene was the predominant tetracycline resistance gene in these strains (81%). The latter gene was co-transferred with the erm (B) gene from porcine S. suis strains to human streptococci in the mating experiments. These results show that, identical erm (B) gene sequences were present in animal and human streptococci and that transfer of the erm (B) gene from porcine S. suis to human streptococci and vice versa is possible, but probably occurs at a low frequency.
TI  - Dilemma of virulence of Streptococcus suis: Canadian isolate 89-1591 characterized as a virulent strain using a standardized experimental model in pigs.
AB  - Virulence of Streptococccus suis capsular type 2 strain 89-1591 has been controversial in literature. A standardized experimental model with specific-pathogen free piglets was used for a new evaluation of this strain. Twenty-nine piglets were allotted in 4 separated groups. Group 1 consisted of negative control animals which received broth medium. Groups 2, 3, and 4 were intravenously challenged with 2 mL of S. suis, strains 1330, 89-1591, and 166', respectively. The strain 1330 is a recognized avirulent Canadian strain. The strain 166' is a reference French virulent isolate. Pigs inoculated with strain 1330 did not present clinical signs of a S. suis infection. Contamination in organs and bacterial blood circulation were rare and lesions were almost non-existent. Infection of pigs with S. suis strain 89-1591 (group 3) and 166' (group 4) caused severe clinical problems, animals infected with S. suis 166' were the most affected. Pigs presented with clinical signs such as high body temperature, lameness, nervous symptoms, and even mortality. Lesions associated with S. suis were numerous for both strains, but more evident in animals of group 4. It can be concluded that S. suis strain 89-1591 is virulent, although its virulence seems to be lower than that of the French strain. Results of an experimental infection with strain 89-1591 may depend on different factors such as the route of inoculation and the immunological status of the animals used. Using conventional animals, with an unknown status regarding previous S. suis infections, equivocal results may be obtained, and this may explain differences reported by some authors with the same strain.
TI  - Acquisition of plasmin activity and induction of arachidonic acid release by Streptococcus suis in contact with human brain microvascular endothelial cells.
AB  - Infections caused by Streptococcus suis, a major swine pathogen, include meningitis, arthritis, pneumonia and septicaemia. In this study, we investigated interactions that may occur between human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC), the main constituent of the blood-brain barrier, and S. suis. We show that S. suis acquires plasmin activity in a time-dependent manner when in contact with cultured HBMEC. Cell-associated plasmin activity reached a plateau following a 48h co-incubation period. Zymography analysis revealed that HBMEC produce urokinase, which is probably involved in activation of plasminogen bound to S. suis. We also show that a S. suis culture supernatant which possesses both phospholipase C and haemolysin (suilysin) activities was able to induce the release of arachidonic acid from the membrane of HBMEC. Evidence suggests that the action of suilysin on HBMEC may be a prerequisite for the action of additional molecules such as phospholipase C. These new biological effects associated with S. suis may play an important role in the migration of S. suis through the blood-brain barrier and in the modulation of local inflammation.
TI  - Human infective endocarditis caused by Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Human infective endocarditis due to Streptococcus suis occurs infrequently. The case of a 43-year-old male who sustained life-threatening infective endocarditis is reported. Since growth of S. suis on commonly used sheep blood agar plates resembles viridans streptococci, diagnosis of S. suis constitutes a diagnostic pitfall. Identification was accomplished by using molecular methods.

TI  - Dps/Dpr ferritin-like protein: insights into the mechanism of iron incorporation  and evidence for a central role in cellular iron homeostasis in Streptococcus suis.
AB  - The Dps family members constitute a distinct group of multimeric and ferritin-like iron binding proteins (up to 500 iron atoms/12-mer) that are widespread in eubacteria and archaea and implicated in oxidative stress resistance and virulence. Despite the wealth of structural knowledge, the mechanism of iron incorporation has remained elusive. Here, we provide evidence on Dpr of the swine and human pathogen Streptococcus suis that: (i) iron incorporation proceeds by Fe(II) binding, Fe(II) oxidation and subsequent storage as Fe(III); (ii) Fe(II) atoms enter the 12-mer cavity through four hydrophilic pores; and (iii) Fe(II) atoms are oxidized inside the 12-mer cavity at 12 identical inter-subunit sites, which are structurally different but functionally equivalent to the ferroxidase centres of classical ferritins. We also provide evidence, by deleting and ectopically overexpressing Dpr, that Dpr affects cellular iron homeostasis. The key residues responsible for iron incorporation in S. suis Dpr are well conserved throughout the Dps family. A model for the iron incorporation mechanism of the Dps/Dpr ferritin-like protein is proposed.
TI  - Detection of extracellular factor-positive Streptococcus suis serotype 2 strains  in tonsillar swabs of live sows by PCR.
AB  - In this study, the sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of a PCR for the detection of EF-positive Streptococcus suis serotype 2 strains in tonsillar swabs of live sows were assessed. We sampled 471 sows originating from four farrow-to-finish farms by tonsillar swabbing and collected their tonsils after slaughter. On these specimens, a PCR, a bacterial examination (BE) or both were performed for the detection of EF-positive S. suis serotype 2 strains. Swab-PCR, Tonsil-PCR and Tonsil-BE were regarded as three integral tests. A Bayesian approach was used to calculate the Se and Sp of the tests. Se and Sp for Swab-PCR were 0.63 (95% credibility interval <0.52, 0.74>) and 0.96 (<0.92, 0.99>), respectively. Values for Se and Sp of Tonsil-PCR amounted to 0.88 (<0.75, 0.96>) and 0.94 (<0.87, 0.99>), respectively. For Tonsil-BE, Se was 0.65 (<0.51, 0.76>) and Sp was 0.97 (<0.91, 0.99>). Repetition of the swabbing procedure after 10 min resulted in a higher Se 0.85 (<0.67, 0.96>) than the Se of the first-Swab-PCR. Repetition of the PCR on the same sample did not result in any significant changes in the outcome of the analysis.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in Hong Kong: 10-years' experience.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We studied the etiology, clinical features and outcome of patients with bacterial meningitis from an urban Chinese city over a 10-years period. METHODS: We reviewed the files of all persons aged 15-years old or above diagnosed with community-acquired bacterial meningitis from a regional hospital. The clinical findings, relevant laboratory and imaging results as well as outcome were recorded in cases with microbiological evidence of meningitis. Neurosurgical and pediatric patients were excluded. RESULTS: Sixty-five patients between the ages of 15 and 86 years of age (mean 52 years) were identified of whom 18 (28%) died. The four most common causes were Mycobacteria tuberculosis (46%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (11%), Streptococcus suis (9%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (8%). Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae were rare pathogens. The annual incidence of community-acquired bacterial meningitis was 1.27/100,000 adults. Delay in treatment was associated with a poorer prognosis (p<0.001, OR=38.84, CI=7.33-205.80). CONCLUSION: The causative organisms found in this region of China differ from that reported from Europe and the US; tuberculous meningitis is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Pulmonary infections in swine induce altered porcine surfactant protein D expression and localization to dendritic cells in bronchial-associated lymphoid tissue.
AB  - Surfactant protein D (SP-D) is a pattern-recognition molecule of the innate immune system that recognizes various microbial surface-specific carbohydrate and lipid patterns. In vitro data has suggested that this binding may lead to increased microbial association with macrophages and dendritic cells. The aim of the present in vivo study was to study the expression of porcine SP-D (pSP-D) in the lung during different pulmonary bacterial infections, and the effect of the routes of infection on this expression was elucidated. Furthermore, the aim was to study the in vivo spatial relationship among pSP-D, pathogens, phagocytic cells and dendritic cells. Lung tissue was collected from experimental and natural bronchopneumonias caused by Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae or Staphylococcus aureus, and from embolic and diffuse interstitial pneumonia, caused by Staph. aureus or Arcanobacterium pyogenes and Streptococcus suis serotype 2, respectively. By comparing normal and diseased lung tissue from the same lungs, increased diffuse pSP-D immunoreactivity was seen in the surfactant in both acute and chronic bronchopneumonias, while such increased expression of pSP-D was generally not present in the interstitial pneumonias. Co-localization of pSP-D, alveolar macrophages and bacteria was demonstrated, and pSP-D showed a patchy distribution on the membranes of alveolar macrophages. SP-D immunoreactivity was intracellular in dendritic cells. The dendritic cells were identified by their morphology, the absence of macrophage marker immunoreactivity and the presence of dendritic cell marker immunoreactivity. Increased expression of pSP-D in the surfactant coincided with presence of pSP-D-positive dendritic cells in bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT), indicating a possible transport of pSP-D through the specialized M cells overlying (BALT). In conclusion, we have shown that pSP-D expression in the lung surfactant is induced by bacterial infection by an aerogenous route rather than by a haematogenous route, and that the protein interacts specifically with alveolar macrophages and with dendritic cells in microbial-induced BALT. The function of the interaction between pSP-D and dendritic cells in BALT remain unclear, but pSP-D could represent a link between the innate and adaptive immune system, facilitating the bacterial antigen presentation by dendritic cells in BALT.
TI  - Prevalence of the suilysin gene in Streptococcus suis strains isolated from diseased and healthy carrier pigs.
AB  - Knowledge of virulence factors of Streptococcus suis is limited. Several virulence factor candidates have been proposed, among them suilysin, which is responsible for a toxic effect on epithelial cells. The aim of this study was to detect the suilysin gene sequence in Streptococcus suis strains of various origin. In total 63 Streptococcus suis isolates were investigated. Forty four of them originated from tissues of streptococcosis affected animals. The remaining 19 strains were isolated from tonsils of healthy carrier pigs. Suilysin gene specific sequence was detected in 79% of the strains tested. In isolates obtained from pigs with signs of streptococcosis this gene sequence was recorded in 85% of cases. In Streptococcus suis strains isolated from healthy carrier pigs the suilysin gene was detected in 63% of the isolates. It seems that suilysin toxic activity is only one of the many steps involved in the pathogenesis of Streptococcus suis infection and that strain's virulence cannot be stated only on the basis of suilysin gene sequence presence.
TI  - The negative acute phase response of serum transthyretin following Streptococcus  suis infection in the pig.
AB  - Transthyretin (TTR) is a serum protein which is a negative acute phase reactant in humans and levels of TTR are routinely measured as an indicator of health status. Such tests have yet to be established for the pig. In order to measure serum TTR in the pig during an acute phase response an assay was developed using anti-human TTR antibodies which cross reacted with porcine TTR. The assay had a detection limit of 32 microg/mL while the mean concentration of transthyretin measured in healthy pig serum was 302 +/- 8 microg/mL (n = 63). There was no significant difference in the serum concentration of TTR in three different age groups from 10 to 25 weeks. Following Streptococcus suis type 2 infection transthyretin showed a negative acute phase response with serum concentrations reaching a significantly lower level at two days following infection.
TI  - Streptococcus suis meningitis in Thailand.
AB  - Streptococcus suis may be the second most common cause of adult streptococcal meningitis. The clinical and epidemiological data of S. suis meningitis are occasionally reviewed. To date, there have been only two large case series from Hong Kong and the Netherlands. We describe twelve cases of S. suis meningitis who were admitted to Chulalongkorn University Hospital, Bangkok, during a 6-year period between 1997 and 2002. A comparative review of case reports of S. suis meningitis in Thailand, Hong Kong, and the Netherlands is presented and revealed no significant differences between the three series. However, the cases from Thailand and Hong Kong had a significantly greater number of associated skin and soft tissue infections. Clinically, S. suis meningitis may appear acute or with a more chronic course.

TI  - Serotyping and evaluation of the virulence in mice of Streptococcus suis strains  isolated from diseased pigs.
AB  - A total of 110 strains of Streptococcus suis, isolated from diseased pigs in Brazil were serotyped and analyzed for virulence. Serotyping of the strains resulted in the following classification: 42 strains of serotype 2 (38.2%), 10 strains of serotype 14 (9.1%), seven strains of serotype 9 (6.4%), three strains each of serotype 7 and 11 (2.7%), two strains each of serotype 1 and 8 (1.8%) and one strain each of serotypes 1/2, 3, 5, 6 and 10 (0.9%). Cross reactions among serotypes 1, 14 and 7 were observed in 21 strains (19.1%). Only 41.9% of the strains were lethal for mice using the pathogenicity test.

TI  - The concentration of apolipoprotein A-I decreases during experimentally induced acute-phase processes in pigs.
AB  - In this work, apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) was purified from pig sera. The responses of this protein after sterile inflammation and in animals infected with Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae or Streptococcus suis were investigated. Decreases in the concentrations of ApoA-I, two to five times lower than the initial values, were observed at 2 to 4 days. It is concluded that ApoA-I is a negative acute-phase protein in pigs.
TI  - Generation of transposon insertion mutant libraries for Gram-positive bacteria by electroporation of phage Mu DNA transposition complexes.
AB  - Transposon mutagenesis is a powerful technique for generating collections of insertion mutants for genetic studies. This paper describes how phage Mu DNA transposition complexes, transpososomes, can be exploited for gene delivery to efficiently introduce selectable markers to genomes of Gram-positive bacteria. Mu transpososomes were assembled in vitro with custom-designed mini-Mu transposons, concentrated, and electroporated into cells of three Gram-positive bacterial species: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus suis. Within cells, the complexes reproduced an authentic DNA transposition reaction and integrated the delivered transposons into the bacterial genomes, yielding single-copy insertions. The integration efficiency among different species and strains of Gram-positive bacteria ranged from 1x10(1) to 2x10(4) c.f.u. (mug introduced transposon DNA)(-1). The strategy should be applicable to a variety of other Gram-positive species after initial optimization of certain key factors affecting transposon delivery, such as the preparation method of competent cells and physical parameters of electroporation. This study extends the scope of the Mu transpososome delivery-based genomic DNA integration strategy to Gram-positive bacteria. Thus, a straightforward generation of sizeable mutant banks is feasible for these bacteria, potentiating several types of genomic-level approaches for studies of a variety of important bacterial processes, such as pathogenicity.
TI  - Identification of the gene encoding a 38-kilodalton immunogenic and protective antigen of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - In our continued effort to search for a Streptococcus suis protein(s) that can serve as a vaccine candidate or a diagnostic reagent, we constructed and screened a gene library with a polyclonal antibody raised against the whole-cell protein of S. suis type 2. A clone that reacted with the antibody was identified and characterized. Analysis revealed that the gene encoding the protein is localized within a 2.0-kbp EcoRI DNA fragment. The nucleotide sequence contained an open reading frame that encoded a polypeptide of 445 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 46.4 kDa. By in vitro protein synthesis and Western blot experiments, the protein exhibited an electrophoretic mobility of approximately 38 kDa. At the amino acid level the deduced primary sequence shared homology with sequences of unknown function from Streptococcus pneumoniae (89%), Streptococcus mutans (86%), Lactococcus lactis (80%), Listeria monocytogenes (74%), and Clostridium perfringens (64%). Except for strains of serotypes 20, 26, 32, and 33, Southern hybridization analysis revealed the presence of the gene in strains of other S. suis serotypes and demonstrated restriction fragment length differences caused by a point mutation in the EcoRI recognition sequence. We confirmed expression of the 38-kDa protein in the hybridization-positive isolates using specific antiserum against the purified protein. The recombinant protein was reactive with serum from pigs experimentally infected with virulent strains of S. suis type 2, suggesting that the protein is immunogenic and may serve as an antigen of diagnostic importance for the detection of most S. suis infections. Pigs immunized with the recombinant 38-kDa protein mounted antibody responses to the protein and were completely protected against challenge with a strain of a homologous serotype, the wild-type virulent strain of S. suis type 2, suggesting that it may be a good candidate for the development of a vaccine that can be used as protection against S. suis infection. Analysis of the cellular fractions of the bacterium by Western blotting revealed that the protein was present in the surface and cell wall extracts. The functional role of the protein with respect to pathogenesis and whether antibodies against the antigen confer protective immunity against diseases caused by strains of other pathogenic S. suis capsular types remains to be determined.
TI  - Biochemical analysis, cpn60 and 16S rDNA sequence data indicate that Streptococcus suis serotypes 32 and 34, isolated from pigs, are Streptococcus orisratti.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotypes have traditionally been identified by morphology, biochemical profiling and serotyping. Analysis of the sequences of 16S rRNA and cpn60 genes of the 35 characterized serotypes of S. suis led to the observation that two serotypes 32 and 34, are significantly distinct from other S. suis serotypes and may represent a distinct species. Here we present DNA sequence data and biochemical profiles which indicate that S. suis serotypes 32 and 34, isolated from pigs, are clustered with Streptococcus orisratti, a Voges-Proskauer negative, alpha-haemolytic, aesculin-hydrolytic, Lancefield group A streptococcus isolated from the teeth of rats.
TI  - Fluid- or surface-phase human salivary scavenger protein gp340 exposes different  bacterial recognition properties.
AB  - Salivary scavenger receptor cysteine-rich protein gp340 aggregates streptococci and other bacteria as part of the host innate defense system at mucosal surfaces. In this article, we have investigated the properties of fluid-phase gp340 and hydroxylapatite surface-adsorbed gp340 in aggregation and adherence, respectively, of viridans group streptococci (e.g., Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus mutans), non-viridans group streptococci (e.g., Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus suis), and oral Actinomyces. Fluid-phase gp340 and surface-phase gp340 bioforms were differentially recognized by streptococci, which formed three phenotypic groupings according to their modes of interaction with gp340. Group I streptococci were aggregated by and adhered to gp340, and group II streptococci preferentially adhered to surface-bound gp340, while group III streptococci were preferentially aggregated by gp340. Each species of Streptococcus tested was found to contain strains representative of at least two of these gp340 interaction groupings. The gp340 interaction modes I to III and sugar specificities of gp340 binding strains coincided for several species. Many gp340 interactions were sialidase sensitive, and each of the interaction modes (I to III) for S. gordonii was correlated with a variant of sialic acid specificity. Adherence of S. gordonii DL1 (Challis) to surface-bound gp340 was dependent upon expression of the sialic acid binding adhesin Hsa. However, aggregation of cells by fluid-phase gp340 was independent of Hsa and involved SspA and SspB (antigen I/II family) polypeptides. Conversely, both gp340-mediated aggregation and adherence of S. mutans NG8 involved antigen I/II polypeptide. Deletion of the mga virulence regulator gene in S. pyogenes resulted in increased cell aggregation by gp340. These results suggest that salivary gp340 recognizes different bacterial receptors according to whether gp340 is present in the fluid phase or surface bound. This phase-associated differential recognition by gp340 of streptococcal species of different levels of virulence and diverse origins may mediate alternative host responses to commensal or pathogenic bacterial phenotypes.
TI  - Strain-dependent disruption of blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier by Streptoccocus suis in vitro.
AB  - Streptococcus suis capsular type 2 is an important agent of diseases including meningitis among pigs worldwide, and is also a zoonotic agent. The barrier function of the choroid plexus epithelium that constitutes the structural basis for the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier has not been elucidated yet in bacterial meningitis. We investigated the influence of various S. suis isolates on the barrier function of cultured porcine choroid plexus epithelial cells with respect to the transepithelial resistance and paracellular [(3)H]-mannitol flux. Preferentially apical application of S. suis isolates significantly decreased transepithelial resistance and significantly increased paracellular [(3)H]-mannitol flux in a time-, dose- and strain-dependent manner. Viable S. suis isolates caused cytotoxicity determined by lactate dehydrogenase assay and electron microscopy, whereas S. suis sonicates and UV-inactivated S. suis did not cause cytotoxicity. The observed effects on porcine choroid plexus epithelial cells barrier function could not exclusively be ascribed to known virulence factors of S. suis such as suilysin. In conclusion, S. suis isolates induce loss of blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier function in an in vitro model. Thus, S. suis may facilitate trafficking of bacteria and leucocytes across the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. The underlying mechanisms for the barrier breakdown have yet to be determined.

TI  - Structure-activity relationships of galabioside derivatives as inhibitors of E. coli and S. suis adhesins: nanomolar inhibitors of S. suis adhesins.
AB  - Four collections of Gal alpha1-4Gal derivatives were synthesised and evaluated as inhibitors of the PapG class II adhesin of uropathogenic Escherichia coli and of the P(N) and P(O) adhesins of Streptococcus suis strains. Galabiosides carrying aromatic structures at C1, methoxyphenyl O-galabiosides in particular, were identified as potent inhibitors of the PapG adhesin. Phenylurea derivatisation at C3' and methoxymethylation at O2' of galabiose provided inhibitors of the S. suis strains type P(N) adhesin with remarkably high affinities (30 and 50 nM, respectively). In addition, quantitative structure-activity relationship models for E. coli PapG adhesin and S. suis adhesin type P(O) were developed using multivariate data analysis. The inhibitory lead structures constitute an advancement towards high-affinity inhibitors as potential anti-adhesion therapeutic agents targeting bacterial infections.
TI  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 binding to extracellular matrix proteins.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is a major swine and human pathogen that causes septicemia and meningitis. The ability of S. suis serotype 2 to bind to different extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins was evaluated by ELISA. All 23 strains tested bound to plasma and cellular fibronectin and collagen types I, III, and V, some to fibrin, vitronectin, and laminin, and none to the other ECM proteins tested. An unencapsulated isogenic mutant bound to ECM proteins better than its parental encapsulated strain, suggesting that the polysaccharide capsule interfered with binding. Cross-inhibition was observed between soluble plasma fibronectin and collagens in the ECM adherence assay, indicating that binding domains for both proteins exist on the same or nearby bacterial surface molecules. On the other hand, pre-incubation with plasma fibronectin increased binding to collagen IV, suggesting that S. suis might use fibronectin as a bridging molecule. The results of heat treatment and proteolytic digestion suggest that adhesins for these ECM proteins are proteinaceous in nature.
TI  - Putative mannose-specific phosphotransferase system component IID represses expression of suilysin in serotype 2 Streptococcus suis.
AB  - In this study, we generated a genomic mutant library from a North American strain of serotype 2 Streptococcus suis using the pGh9:ISS1 transposition vector. Suilysin is the hemolysin made by S. suis. A hyper-hemolytic mutant was identified by screening for hemolytic phenotype using media with human blood. The hyper-hemolytic phenotype was characterised by a quantitative hemolysis microplate method. The use of green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter also showed that suilysin gene expression was greater in the mutant. DNA sequence analysis of 3.8 kb surrounding the ISS1 insertion site revealed four open reading frames (ORFs) with three consecutive ORFs that belong to a putative mannose-specific phosphotransferase system (PTS). The S. suis gene homologous to mannose permease IID, manN, was interrupted by the transposon. A complementation test showed that manN repressed the expression of suilysin and the absence of manN was responsible for the hyper-hemolytic phenotype. However, both wild type and isogenic hyper-hemolytic mutant S. suis fermented mannose, glucose and lactose. Thus, despite its potential roles in carbohydrate transport, phosphorylation and metabolism, the manN homologue in the putative mannose-specific PTS regulates gene expression in S. suis.
TI  - Different foreign genes incidentally integrated into the same locus of the Streptococcus suis genome.
AB  - Some strains of Streptococcus suis possess a type II restriction-modification (RM) system, whose genes are thought to be inserted into the genome between purH and purD from a foreign source by illegitimate recombination. In this study, we characterized the purHD locus of the S. suis genomes of 28 serotype reference strains by DNA sequencing. Four strains contained the RM genes in the locus, as described before, whereas 11 strains possessed other genetic regions of seven classes. The genetic regions contained a single gene or multiple genes that were either unknown or similar to hypothetical genes of other bacteria. The mutually exclusive localization of the genetic regions with the atypical G+C contents indicated that these regions were also acquired from foreign sources. No transposable element or long-repeat sequence was found in the neighboring regions. An alignment of the nucleotide sequences, including the RM gene regions, suggested that the foreign regions were integrated by illegitimate recombination via short stretches of nucleotide identity. By using a thermosensitive suicide plasmid, the RM genes were experimentally introduced into an S. suis strain that did not contain any foreign genes in that locus. Integration of the plasmid into the S. suis genome did not occur in the purHD locus but occurred at various chromosomal loci, where there were 2 to 10 bp of nucleotide identity between the chromosome and the plasmid. These results suggest that various foreign genes described here were incidentally integrated into the same locus of the S. suis genome.
TI  - Cloning, purification, and enzymatic properties of dipeptidyl peptidase IV from the swine pathogen Streptococcus suis.
AB  - In this study, the dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) of the swine pathogen Streptococcus suis was cloned, overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and characterized. The coding region comprises 2,268 nucleotides containing an open reading frame that codes for a 755-amino-acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 85 kDa. The amino acid sequence contained the sequence Gly-X-Ser-X-X-Gly, which is a consensus motif flanking the active-site serine shared by serine proteases. The recombinant DPP IV showed a high affinity for the synthetic peptide glycine-proline-p-nitroanilide and was strongly inhibited by Hg2+ and diprotin A.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical strains of Streptococcus suis isolated from pigs in Spain.
AB  - The antimicrobial susceptibility of 151 clinical Streptococcus suis strains isolated from diseased pigs in Spain was determined by a microdilution method. Isolates were mostly susceptible to beta-lactam antimicrobials, aminoglycosides, enrofloxacin, novobiocin and spectinomycin. More than 87% of the S. suis isolates were resistant to tetracyclines, sulphonamides, macrolides and clindamycin. Strains of serotype 9 were significantly more resistant than strains of serotype 2 (P<0.05) to tylosin (94% versus 77%) and clindamycin (94% versus 64%). Eighty-seven percent of the S. suis isolates were resistant to at least four antimicrobials and nine isolates (6%) were resistant to at least six antimicrobials. The most frequently identified multidrug pattern involved resistance against tetracyclines, sulphonamides, macrolides and lincosamides, with 69% of the isolates exhibiting this resistotype. Fifteen out of the 22 strains of serotype 2 (68.2%), and 84 out of the 98 of the strains of serotype 9 (85.7%) exhibited this resistotype, indicating its widespread distribution among the strains of the two most frequently isolated serotypes.
TI  - Inhibition of Streptococcus suis adhesion by dendritic galabiose compounds at low nanomolar concentration.
AB  - A series of mono-, di-, and tetravalent galabiose (Galalpha1-4Gal) compounds were synthesized in good yields by coupling of a general carboxylic acid-bearing sugar building block to dendritic scaffolds based on the 3,5-di-(2-aminoethoxy)benzoic acid branching unit. Furthermore, a poly(amidoamine)- (PAMAM-) based dendritic galabioside was synthesized containing eight galabiose units. All galabiosides were tested in a hemagglutination assay and a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) competition assay in order to establish their potency in the binding to the bacterial Gram-positive pathogen Streptococcus suis. A monovalent galabioside containing a short spacer was used as a reference compound in all the assays. Variations in the scaffold as well as in the spacer arms were introduced to determine their influence on the inhibition. The best inhibitor of hemagglutination was an octavalent galabioside with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.3 nM, to the best of our knowledge the first example of inhibition of bacterial binding by a soluble carbohydrate at a subnanomolar concentration.
TI  - Intracellular invasion and persistence: survival strategies of Streptococcus suis and Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis.
AB  - Streptococcus (S.) suis and Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (MAP) differ substantially in their host specificity and tissue tropism. S. suis is a facultative pathogen in swine, which mainly colonises the upper respiratory tract and can cause meningitis, septicemia, arthritis and pneumonia. In contrast, MAP is an obligatory pathogen causing paratuberculosis in ruminants, and shows high tropism for the intestinal tract. Both pathogens are able to invade and persist in host cells. In S. suis, the significance of invasion for pathogenesis is a matter of controversial discussions. In vitro it has been shown that S. suis is internalized by epithelial cells and survives intracellularly for at least 24 h. However, at present there is no evidence that S. suis invades epithelial cells also in vivo. In MAP, on the other hand, persistence in macrophages is generally considered a crucial step in pathogenesis, but it remains to be elucidated, how it contributes to pathophysiology of the disease. The two pathogens exemplify how intracellular invasion and persistence might play different roles in pathogenesis. In S. suis, intracellular life may represent only a transient retreat phase, whereas in MAP it is the predominant in vivo niche of the pathogen.
TI  - [Evaluation of Prolex for the rapid identification of streptococci isolated in medical microbiology].
AB  - The need to rapidly identify streptococci responsible for acute infectious diseases has led to the development of agglutination techniques that are able to identify streptococcal group antigens (A, B, C, D, F, and G) directly from primoculture colonies on blood agar. The Prolex agglutination tests (Pro-Lab Diagnostics, Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada), distributed in France by i2a, have been used for the determination of group antigens of 166 isolates of streptococci and enterococci previously identified in the National Reference Center for Streptococci. The results obtained with the Prolex reagents have permitted to correctly identify all pyogenic beta-hemolytic streptococci (23 Streptococcus pyogenes, 21 Streptococcus agalactiae, 33 Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis including 6 group C and 27 group G, and 5 Streptococcus porcinus including 4 group B). Four differences between unexpected agglutinations (A or F) and species identifications have been obtained. These differences were observed for four non-hemolytic isolates of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus infantarius, and Streptococcus suis. The anti-D reagent has been of value as a marker for isolates of enterococci. Thus, these results confirm the abilities of these agglutination tests for the grouping of beta-hemolytic streptococci. Moreover, the use of Prolex has the advantage to be rapid because of the non-enzymatic but chemical extraction of streptococcal antigens.
TI  - Immunogenicity of murein-associated proteins from temperature-stressed Streptococcus suis cultures.
AB  - We compared immunogenicity in pigs of whole cell lysate proteins (WCP) with murein-associated proteins (MAP) obtained from a virulent serotype 2 strain of Streptococcus (S.) suis grown at 32 or 42 degrees C. Protein fractions were tested for their ability to induce antibodies in 3-week-old piglets by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analysis. We found a significant increase in the antibody levels in all sera irrespective of the preparation used for immunization. However, alpha-WCP sera showed higher reactivities than alpha-MAP sera, and piglets immunized with 32 degrees C preparations (alpha-32 sera) showed higher responses than those immunized with 42 degrees C preparations (alpha-42 sera). Western blot analysis revealed that alpha-WCP sera in part reacted with different proteins when compared with alpha-MAP sera. Furthermore, some proteins were only detected by alpha-32 but not by alpha-42 sera. In conclusion, the results demonstrate the immunogenicity of cell wall MAP of S. suis, and highlight the importance of considering growth conditions in the preparation of subunit vaccines.
TI  - Characterization of Streptococcus suis serotype 7 isolates from diseased pigs in  Denmark.
AB  - Isolates of Streptococcus suis serotype 7 from diseased pigs in Denmark were characterized by ribotyping, pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), MIC-determinations and detection of resistance genes. Forty-one different ribotype profiles were found among the 103 isolates and could be divided into two main clusters. No obvious relationship between ribotypes and the clinical origin of the isolates could be observed. Fifty-four isolates, including all 24 isolates belonging to the main ribotype profile were examined by PFGE and 50 different profiles were found. A high frequency of resistance to erythromycin (41%), tetracycline (24%) and streptomycin (28%) was observed. Furthermore, almost all isolates (101) were resistant to sulphamethoxazol. Most isolates were susceptible to ceftiofur, chloramphenicol, florfenicol, penicillin, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim and trimethoprim + sulphonamides. The tet(M) gene was found among 11 (44%) and the tet(O) gene in six (24%) of 25 tetracycline resistant isolates. The tet(L) and tet(S) genes were not detected in any isolates. The erm(B) gene was detected in 39 (93%) of 42 erythromycin resistant isolates.
TI  - Intestinal translocation of Streptococcus suis type 2 EF+ in pigs.
AB  - Sepsis with subsequent multisystem organ failure after translocation of bacteria  from the gut is a serious risk associated with stress situations. We showed that intestinal bacterial translocation could be one of the pathways for pathogenic Streptococcus suis infections in the pig. In 24 piglets weighing 10-14 kg, free of the extracellular factor (EF+) producing phenotype of S. suis serotype 2, a silicon canula was placed in the proximal jejunum to enable intestinal inoculation and bypassing the upper alimentary tract. The pigs were individually housed. After stress induction in 18 pigs by means of a truck drive in individual cages for 1h, pigs were inoculated through the intestinal canula either with S. suis type 2 EF+ or with growth medium only, and put back in their original housing. The six not transported pigs were also inoculated with the same strain. To prevent oral self-infection, faeces were collected in a bag that was glued around the anus. Clinical and behavioral symptoms were recorded for 72 h post inoculation, and then the animals were sacrificed for pathological and bacteriological examination. In three animals, the inoculation strain was re-isolated from mesenterial lymph nodes and typically affected organs. No S. suis type 2 EF+ was detected by specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in any of the tonsil-swabs and -homogenates. We concluded that infection of the organs had taken place after bacterial translocation out of the gut and that the intestinal tract can be a porte d'entree for S. suis type 2 EF+.
TI  - Development of an in vivo Himar1 transposon mutagenesis system for use in Streptococcus equi subsp. equi.
AB  - Streptococcus equi subsp. equi is the causative agent of the equine disease strangles. In this study we describe the development of an in vivo Himar1 transposon system for the random mutagenesis of S. equi and, potentially, other Gram-positive bacteria. We demonstrate efficient and random transposition of a modified mini-transposon onto the chromosome by Southern blot analysis and insertion site sequencing. Non-haemolytic mutants were isolated at a frequency of 0.2%, and acapsular mutants at a frequency of 0.04%. Taken together, these data demonstrate that in vivo Himar1 mutagenesis can be used for genomic-scale mutational analysis of S. equi, and is likely to be applicable to the study of other streptococci.
TI  - Evaluation of a ceftiofur-washed whole cell Streptococcus suis bacterin in pigs.
AB  - The efficacy of currently available washed whole cell Streptococcus suis bacterins is generally poor. We developed and tested the efficacy of a novel ceftiofur-washed whole cell bacterin. Sixty-six, 2-week-old specific pathogen free (SPF) pigs were randomly divided into 5 groups. Three groups were vaccinated 28 and 14 d prior to challenge. The 3 ceftiofur-washed whole cell bacterins each contained 1 of 3 different adjuvants (Montanide ISA 25, Montanide ISA 50, and Saponin). Pigs exhibiting severe central nervous system disease or severe joint swelling and lameness were euthanized immediately and necropsied. All remaining pigs were necropsied at 14 d post inoculation. The ceftiofur-washed whole cell S. suis bacterin with Montanide ISA 50 adjuvant significantly (P < 0.05) reduced bacteremia, meningitis, pneumonia, and mortality associated with S. suis challenge. Further work on this novel approach to bacterin production is warranted.
TI  - Encapsulated Streptococcus suis inhibits activation of signaling pathways involved in phagocytosis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis capsular type 2 is an important zoonotic agent of meningitis.  Previous studies reported that, in contrast to nonencapsulated mutants, encapsulated S. suis is able to resist phagocytosis. However, the mechanisms by which S. suis avoids phagocytosis are unknown. To elucidate the signaling pathway(s) involved in S. suis antiphagocytosis, we compared the ability of an encapsulated strain and its nonencapsulated mutant to induce the activation of Akt and protein kinase C (PKC), which are downstream kinases of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K) pathway, known to be involved in the phagocytosis processes. The results demonstrated high levels of Akt and PKCalpha phosphorylation after infection of J774 macrophages with the nonencapsulated mutant, whereas the encapsulated strain showed reduced activation of PI-3K/Akt/PKCalpha signaling pathway, as well as several protein tyrosine events. These results correlated with the number of intracellular bacteria. Macrophages pretreated with specific PI-3K or PKC inhibitors showed reduced levels of Akt and PKCalpha phosphorylation, resulting in 50% reduction of phagocytosis. The role of phosphatases in the antiphagocytic mechanisms was evaluated by using phosphatase inhibitors, as well as SHP-1-deficient macrophages. Only in the absence of SHP-1 did the phagocytosis of encapsulated S. suis significantly increase, leading to Akt phosphorylation levels similar to those observed with the nonencapsulated strain, indicating activation of this important SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase by encapsulated S. suis. Finally, when purified S. suis capsular polysaccharide (CPS) was added to macrophages, no phosphorylation events were observed. In addition, CPS and encapsulated S. suis were able to inhibit the uptake of the nonencapsulated mutant. These results suggest the importance of CPS in the mechanisms, whereby S. suis downmodulates phagocytosis.
TI  - Response of Streptococcus suis to iron-restricted growth conditions at high and low oxygen availability.
AB  - Streptococcus suis (S. suis) is an important pathogen in pigs and has to overcome strict iron limitations in its host environment. Here, we studied iron-restricted growth of a highly virulent S. suis strain in vitro at aerobic and CO2-enriched growth conditions. At both conditions, depleting of iron in the culture medium with nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) resulted in decreased growth rates and down regulation of several proteins. Sensitivity to NTA was significantly higher at aerobic versus CO2-enriched conditions. Growth could not be restored by addition of host iron sources such as ferritin, hemin, hemoglobin, lactoferrin or transferrin. Accordingly, S. suis was not able to produce detectable amounts of siderophores. On the other hand, growth at iron-restricted conditions was fully restored by addition of Mn2+ (at aerobic and CO2-enriched conditions) or Mg2+ (only at CO2-enriched conditions). In conclusion our results suggest that, unlike many other bacteria, S. suis adapts to iron restricted conditions by a change in its metabolism in order to replace Fe2+ by Mn2+ or Mg2+ rather than by expressing specific iron uptake systems.
TI  - Cloning and purification of the Streptococcus suis serotype 2 glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and its involvement as an adhesin.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is a swine pathogen responsible for diverse diseases and may be present in the tonsils of pigs which show no sign of illness. Because adhesion to host cells may be important in the carrier state, this study was undertaken to characterize a 39 kDa surface protein identified as a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), possibly implicated in the adhesion of the bacteria. The gene encoding for the GAPDH of S. suis was cloned and sequenced. The DNA sequence contained an open reading frame encoding for a 336 amino acid polypeptide exhibiting 95% sequence identity with the GAPDH from Streptococcus pyogenes and from other streptococci. Using the Qiaexpress expression plasmids, the gapdh gene was inducibly overexpressed in E. coli to produce GAPDH with a hexahistidyl N-terminus to permit its purification. The (His)6GAPDH protein was found to possess functional GAPDH enzymatic activity after the purification. An adherence assay with S. suis and porcine tracheal rings pre-incubated with (His)6GAPDH and non-incubated rings was showed a significant reduction in the adhesion of S. suis in the (His)6GAPDH pre-incubated rings compared to the non-incubated rings. The GAPDH protein of S. suis seems to be involved in the first steps of the bacterial adhesion to host cells.
TI  - Non-encapsulated strains reveal novel insights in invasion and survival of Streptococcus suis in epithelial cells.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is a porcine and human pathogen causing invasive diseases, such as meningitis or septicaemia. Host cell interactions of S. suis have been studied mainly with serotype 2 strains, but multiple capsular serotypes as well as non-typeable strains exist with diverse virulence features. At present, S. suis is considered an extracellular pathogen. However, whether or not it can also invade host cells is a matter of controversial discussions. We have assessed adherence and invasion of S. suis for HEp-2 epithelial cells by comparing 10 serotype 2 strains and four non-typeable (NT) strains. Only the NT strains and a non-encapsulated serotype 2 mutant strain, but none of the serotype 2 strains, adhered strongly and were invasive. Invasion seemed to be affected by environmental signals, as suggested from comparison of strains grown in different media. Further phenotypic and genotypic characterization revealed a high diversity among the different strains. Electron microscopic analysis of invasion of selected invasive NT strains indicated different uptake mechanisms. One strain induced large invaginations comparable to those seen in 'caveolae' mediated uptake, whereas invasion of the other strains was accompanied by formation of filipodia-like membrane protrusions. Invasion of all strains, however, was similarly susceptible to hypertonic sucrose, which inhibits receptor-mediated endocytosis. Irrespective of the uptake pathway, streptococci resided in acidified phago-lysosome like vacuoles. All strains, except one, survived intracellularly as well as extracellular acidic conditions. Survival seemed to be associated with the AdiS protein, an environmentally regulated arginine deiminase of S. suis. Concluding, invasion and survival of NT strains of S. suis in epithelial cells revealed novel evidence that S. suis exhibits a broad variety of virulence-associated features depending on genetic variation and regulation.
TI  - Simple and rapid PCR method for identification of streptococcal species relevant  to animal infections based on 23S rDNA sequence.
AB  - A PCR identification system targeting 23S rDNA sequences for the identification of eight streptococcal species relevant to animal infections (Streptococcus agalactiae, S. bovis, S. canis, S. dysgalactiae, S. equi, S. porcinus, S. suis and S. uberis) was developed. This system consists of two PCR reactions, A and B, in which seven and eight primers, respectively, are used simultaneously, and was designed so that each amplification product indicates a species by its size. A total of 111 cultures, including the type strain of eight species, could be successfully identified and differentiated as individual species, except for the cross reactivity between S. bovis and S. equinus. The developed PCR system can complete the identification procedure for eight streptococcal species through two tube reactions per isolate, and, therefore, might provide a rapid, simple and accurate diagnostic tool for veterinary laboratories.
TI  - Multiplex PCR assay for detection of Streptococcus suis species and serotypes 2 and 1/2 in tonsils of live and dead pigs.
AB  - A PCR assay was developed for the detection of Streptococcus suis serotypes 2 and 1/2. This multiplex PCR is based on the amplification of the gene coding for 16S rRNA of S. suis and on the amplification of the cps2J gene coding for the capsule of S. suis serotypes 2 and 1/2. An internal control was constructed and added in this test to monitor the efficiency of amplification in each reaction. To evaluate the specificity of the test, 31 strains of other bacterial species related to S. suis or isolated from pigs and 42 strains of S. suis serotypes 1 and 3 to 34 were analyzed. The detection threshold of the test was 28 S. suis CFU/ml. The specificity and the sensitivity of the multiplex PCR test and the presence of an internal control allowed the analysis of biological samples without a culture step. The PCR assay was then applied to the detection of 14 S. suis serotype 1/2 strains, 88 S. suis serotype 2 strains isolated from pigs, and 25 S. suis serotype 2 strains isolated from humans. This test was also applied to analyze tonsil samples of pigs experimentally infected and carrier pigs without any symptoms.
TI  - Distribution, genetic diversity, and variable expression of the gene encoding hyaluronate lyase within the Streptococcus suis population.
AB  - Although Streptococcus suis is an economically important pathogen of pigs and an  occasional cause of zoonotic infections of humans knowledge of crucial virulence factors, and as a consequence targets for therapeutic or prophylactic intervention, remains limited. Here we describe a detailed study of the distribution, diversity, and in vitro expression of hyaluronate lyase, a protein implicated as a virulence factor of many mucosal pathogens. The gene encoding hyaluronate lyase, hyl, was present in all 309 bona fide S. suis isolates examined representing diverse serotypes, geographic sources, and clinical backgrounds. Examination of the genetic diversity of hyl by RFLP and sequence analysis indicated a pattern of diversity shared by many gram-positive surface proteins with a variable 5' region encoding the most distal cell surface-exposed regions of the protein and a much more conserved 3' region encoding domains more closely associated with the bacterial cell. Variation occurs by several mechanisms, including the accumulation of point mutations and deletion and insertion events, and there is clear evidence that genetic recombination has contributed to molecular variation in this gene. Despite the ubiquitous presence of hyl, the corresponding enzyme activity was detected in fewer than 30% of the 309 isolates. In several cases this lack of activity correlates with the presence of mutations (either sequence duplications or point mutations) within hyl that result in a truncated polypeptide. There is a striking absence of hyaluronate lyase activity in a large majority of isolates from classic S. suis invasive disease, indicating that this protein is probably not a crucial virulence factor, although activity is present in significantly higher numbers of isolates associated with pneumonia.

TI  - Efficacy of vaccines against bacterial diseases in swine: what can we expect?
AB  - This paper discusses what can be expected with regard to efficacy of antibacterial vaccines used in swine, based on the present knowledge of pathogen-host interactions. First, vaccination against bacteria that mainly cause disease by production of exotoxins is considered. Vaccines containing the inactivated toxin or a non-toxic but antigenic recombinant protein derived from the exotoxin can be expected to provide protection against disease. The degree of protection induced by such vaccines varies, however, depending amongst other things on the pathogenesis of the disease. Vaccination against clostridial infections, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae infections, progressive atrophic rhinitis and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, is considered. The second part of the article deals with vaccination against extracellular bacteria. Protection against these bacteria is generally mediated by antibodies against their surface antigens and certain secreted antigens, but cellular immunity may also play a role. Efficacy of vaccines against swine erysipelas, Streptococcus suis infections, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae infections and swine dysentery is discussed. Finally, vaccination against facultatively intracellular bacteria is considered. For protection against these bacteria cell-mediated immunity plays an important role, but antibodies may also be involved. It is generally accepted that live-attenuated vaccines are more suitable for induction of cell-mediated immunity than inactivated vaccines, although this also depends on the adjuvant used in the vaccine. As an example, vaccination against Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium is discussed.
TI  - Identification and characterisation of hyaluronate lyase from Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Hyaluronate lyase, which catalyses the degradation of hyaluronic acid (HA), has been described from several pathogenic streptococcal species. We describe, for the first time, identification and purification of hyaluronate lyase from the zoonotic pig pathogen Streptococcus suis. We have cloned the hyaluronate lyase gene from S. suis and used it to generate an allelic replacement knock-out mutant of S. suis serotype 7 that can no longer biosynthesise the enzyme. Interestingly, a limited strain survey indicates that hyaluronate lyase activity is not present in all disease isolates of S. suis. Polyclonal anti-hyaluronate lyase anti-serum raised against our recombinant hyaluronate lyase has been used in Western blots, showing that hyaluronate lyase activity is always associated with the presence of protein of the expected size, whereas lack of hyaluronate lyase activity is due to truncation or absence of the enzyme. We show that hyaluronate lyase activity is required for S. suis to use HA polymer as a carbon source and that supplying exogenous recombinant hyaluronate lyase to all S. suis strains tested allowed fermentation of the resultant HA breakdown products.
TI  - Porcine choroid plexus epithelial cells induce Streptococcus suis bacteriostasis  in vitro.
AB  - The involvement of the choroid plexus in host defense during bacterial meningitis is unclear. Aiming to elucidate possible antibacterial mechanisms, we stimulated primary porcine choroid plexus epithelial cells (pCPEC) with proinflammatory cytokines and challenged them with various Streptococcus suis strains. In the supernatant of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-stimulated pCPEC, streptococcal growth was markedly suppressed. Costimulation with tumor necrosis factor alpha enhanced this bacteriostatic effect, while supplementation of L-tryptophan completely eliminated it. We also demonstrate that an activation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase in the pCPEC seems to be responsible for the IFN-gamma-induced bacteriostasis. This supports the hypothesis of an active role of the choroid plexus in host defense against bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Crystal structure of Streptococcus suis Dps-like peroxide resistance protein Dpr: implications for iron incorporation.
AB  - The Dps-like peroxide resistance protein (Dpr) is an aerotolerance and hydrogen peroxide resistance agent found in the meningitis-associated pathogen Streptococcus suis. Dpr is believed to act by binding free intracellular iron to prevent Fenton chemistry-catalysed formation of toxic hydroxyl radicals. The crystal structure of Dpr has been determined to 1.95 A resolution. The final model has an Rcyst value of 18.5% (Rfree = 22.4%) and consists of 12 identical monomers (each of them comprising a four alpha-helix bundle) that form a hollow sphere obeying 23 symmetry. Structural features show that Dpr belongs to the Dps family of bacterial proteins. Twelve putative ferroxidase centers, each formed at the interface of neighboring monomer pairs, were identified in the Dpr structure with structural similarities to those found in other Dps family members. Dpr was crystallized in the absence of iron, hence no bound iron was found in the structure in contrast to other Dps family members. A novel metal-binding site approximately 6A from the ferroxidase centre was identified and assigned to a bound calcium ion. Two residues from the ferroxidase centre (Asp63 and Asp74) were found to be involved in calcium binding. Structural comparison with other family members revealed that Asp63 and Asp74 adopt different conformation in the Dpr structure. The structure of Dpr presented here shows potential local conformational changes that may occur during iron incorporation. A role for the metal-binding site in iron uptake is proposed.
TI  - Linkage of interactions in sickle hemoglobin fiber assembly: inhibitory effect emanating from mutations in the AB region of the alpha-chain is annulled by a mutation at its EF corner.
AB  - The AB and GH regions of the alpha-chain are located in spatial proximity and contain a cluster of intermolecular contact residues of the sickle hemoglobin (HbS) fiber. We have examined the role of dynamics of AB/GH region on HbS polymerization through simultaneous replacement of non-contact Ala(19) and Ala(21) of the AB corner with more flexible Gly or rigid alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) residues. The polymerization behavior of HbS with Aib substitutions was similar to the native HbS. In contrast, Gly substitutions inhibited HbS polymerization. Molecular dynamics simulation studies of alpha-chains indicated that coordinated motion of AB and GH region residues present in native (Ala) as well as in Aib mutant was disrupted in the Gly mutant. The inhibitory effect due to Gly substitutions was further explored in triple mutants that included mutation of an inter-doublestrand contact (alphaAsn(78) --> His or Gln) at the EF corner. Although the inhibitory effect of Gly substitutions in the triple mutant was unaffected in the presence of alphaGln(78), His at this site almost abrogated its inhibitory potential. The polymerization studies of point mutants (alphaGln(78) --> His) indicated that the inhibitory effect due to Gly substitutions in the triple mutant was synergistically compensated for by the polymerization-enhancing activity of His(78). Similar synergistic coupling, between alphaHis(78) and an intra-double-strand contact point (alpha16) mutation located in the AB region, was also observed. Thus, two conclusions are made: (i) Gly mutations at the AB corner inhibit HbS polymerization by perturbing the dynamics of the AB/GH region, and (ii) perturbations of AB region (through changes in dynamics of the AB/GH region or abolition of a specific fiber contact site) that influence HbS polymerization do so in concert with alpha78 site at the EF corner. The overall results provide insights about the interaction-linkage between distant regions of the HbS tetramer in fiber assembly.
TI  - Invasion of porcine brain microvascular endothelial cells by Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important swine pathogen that mainly causes meningitis and occasionally causes other infections, such as endocarditis, arthritis, and pneumonia. The pathogenesis of S. suis infection has not been completely defined. However, in order to cause meningitis, S. suis has to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) made up of brain microvascular endothelial cells. The objective of this work was to study the interactions of S. suis serotype 2 with porcine brain microvascular endothelial cells (PBMEC). The ability of North American and European S. suis serotype 2 strains to adhere to PBMEC and, most importantly, to invade PBMEC was demonstrated by using an antibiotic protection assay and was confirmed by electron microscopy. The polysaccharide capsule of S. suis seemed to partially interfere with the adhesion and invasion abilities of the bacterium. Our results showed that intracellular viable S. suis could be found in PBMEC up to 7 h after antibiotic treatment. Inhibition studies demonstrated that invasion of PBMEC by S. suis required actin microfilaments but not microtubular cytoskeletal elements or active bacterial RNA or protein synthesis. At high bacterial doses, suilysin-positive strains were toxic for PBMEC. The role of suilysin in cytotoxicity was confirmed by using purified suilysin, electron microscopy, and the lack of toxicity of a suilysin-negative mutant. In swine, the invasion of endothelial cells of the BBB could play an important role in the pathogenesis of the meningitis caused by S. suis.
TI  - Expression of green fluorescent protein and its application in pathogenesis studies of serotype 2 Streptococcus suis.
AB  - We investigated the interaction between type 2 Streptococcus suis and swine phagocytes during infection of the natural host, by using green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a specific marker to observe the challenge organism. We compared the strength of the S. suis sly promoter (SP332) and the synthetic promoter (CP25) in driving GFP expression. Two GFP alleles, gfpP11 and gfpmut3*, were also compared. The two promoters and two alleles were efficiently compared using three different promoter-GFP gene combinations on a shuttle vector, which were transformed into S. suis strains SX332, SX932 or M2. Plasmid pSL6.81 has SP332 with gfpP11, pSL5.24 has SP332 with gfpmut3*, and pSL5.28 has CP25 with gfpmut3*. The transformants were fluorescent with green light when viewed with an epifluorescence microscope or during flow cytometry. The signal was also detected using a laser scanning confocal microscope. The GFP expression level varied and CP25 with gfpmut3* led to greatest expression. For optimizing GFP detection, fluorescence-based cell sorting was applied to SX332(pSL5.28) and the mean fluorescence intensity increased 25.9% after optimization. Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS)-based phagocytosis assay showed that, without opsonization, phagocytosis rates of SX332, SX932 and M2 by both neutrophils and monocytes were similar and low. After opsonization, the phagocytosis of M2 increased 10-fold while phagocytosis of SX332 and SX932 did not change. GFP-labeled S. suis was identified in fresh pig tonsil tissue 18 h after infection. The results of this study indicated that GFP was expressed in type 2 S. suis and GFP labeled S. suis could be used in phagocytosis and pathogenesis studies.
TI  - Investigation of a novel DNase of Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - A secreted nuclease, SsnA, was identified in the virulent Streptococcus suis isolate SX332 and subsequently in each of the type strains of capsular serotypes 1 through 9. Screening of 258 porcine clinical isolates from surface (nasal mucosa or palatine tonsil) or internal (joint, brain or other internal organ) locations revealed a significant relationship (P < 0.001) between expression of nuclease and isolation from an internal site. A 3,126-bp gene, ssnA, was identified from a phenotypically nuclease-negative pGh9:ISS1 insertion mutant, and analysis of the predicted SsnA sequence revealed a 35-amino-acid (aa) secretion signal sequence, a 22-aa DNA-binding domain, and a typical gram-positive cell wall sorting motif. A requirement of Ca2+ and Mg2+ for SsnA activity was determined, and the substrate specificity was found to be for single- and double-stranded linear DNA. Reverse transcription-PCR experiments revealed that ssnA is expressed throughout all stages of S. suis growth, and Western blots with porcine anti-S. suis immune sera against a recombinant, truncated SsnA derivative (rSsnADelta) confirmed that SsnA is expressed in vivo. Furthermore, anti-rSsnADelta antibodies were sufficient to neutralize SsnA activity. Analyses of subcellular fractions of SX332 and derived mutants, on DNA-containing polyacrylamide gels and by Western blotting, suggest that SsnA is cell wall located.
TI  - Acquisition of host plasmin activity by the Swine pathogen Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - In this study, the plasminogen-binding activity of Streptococcus suis serotype 2  was investigated. Bound human plasminogen was activated by purified streptokinase, urokinase, or Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis culture supernatant. Both human and porcine plasminogen were bound by S. suis. Binding was inhibited by epsilon-aminocaproic acid, and the plasminogen receptor was heat and sodium dodecyl sulfate resistant. One of the receptors was identified as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. S. suis-associated plasmin activity was capable of activating free plasminogen, which in turn could contribute to degradation of fibronectin. This is the first report on the plasminogen-binding activity of S. suis. Further studies may reveal a contribution of this activity to the virulence of S. suis.
TI  - Epidemiology of Streptococcus suis serotype 5 infection in a pig herd with and without clinical disease.
AB  - The aim of this study was to describe the transmission and the kinetics of the infection caused by Streptococcus suis serotype 5 in a multisite farrow-to-finish pig herd. Most sows carried S. suis serotype 5 in their vaginal tract, but not in their nasal cavities, as demonstrated by immunomagnetic separation (IMS) technique. Their offspring became infected during farrowing, confirming vertical transmission. During the first 4 weeks of life, a low number of piglets were carriers of S. suis serotype 5 in their nasal cavities. However, when clinical signs appeared, the carrier rate significantly increased, suggesting that isolation from nasal cavities is a better indication of active transmission than of a carrier state. Clinical cases were present in animals between 4 and 8 weeks of age, when maternal antibodies were at their lowest level. Up to six different genotypes of the same serotype could be identified by random amplified polymorphic DNA; however, a single clone was responsible for all clinical cases studied. This clone could only be isolated from a single sow, indicating that its prevalence in breeding animals was low. Interestingly, 1 year later, clinical disease associated with S. suis serotype 5 spontaneously disappeared. At that time, the genotype responsible for the clinical signs was not detected in the herd and the levels of antibodies in sows and maternal antibodies in piglets were not higher than those of the previous year.
TI  - [Antimicrobial action of ammonium salts of fused heterocycles containing ortho-nitrogen].
AB  - By alkylation of hexamethylenetetramine with halogenated derivatives of ketones,  ethers, esters or amides of acids, alkyl- and aralkyl halides the corresponding N-monoalkylated compounds of hexamethylenetetramine were obtained. The quaternization of pyridine nitrogen in 5,6-benzoquinoline, 8-hydroxyquinoline, quinoline, 1,10-phenanthroline molecules with alkyl- or aralkylhalides was carried out. The susceptibility of Gram-positive (Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (E. coli, Salmonella cholerae suis, Salmonella enteridis Gartneri) microorganisms to synthesized quaternary ammonium salts by disc difussion method has been detected. The bacteriostatic action of 0.5-1% solutions of all compounds was assessed in comparison with benzalkonium chloride. It was shown, that the most effectiveness against all strains is possessed by quaternary hexamethylenetetramine ammonium salts, and especially salts, containing 1-propynyl- or hydroxycarbamoylmethyl radicals. The action of these two compounds against Salmonella and Streptococcus was stronger than the action of benzalkonium chloride. Susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to these compounds were detected. It was shown, that 1% solutions of chlorides of N-(1-propynyl) hexamethylenetetramonium and N-(hydroxycarbamoylmethyl) hexamethylenetetrammonium demonstrate the same bacteriostatic action against P. aeruginosa as well as benzalkonium chloride.
TI  - [Occurrence and diagnostic relevance of virulence-associated factors in Streptococcus suis].
AB  - Streptococcus suis (Sc. suis) can cause very different clinical entities. In contrast to Sc. suis-associated pneumonia, the induction of meningitis, septicemia, and polyarthritis by certain Sc. suis strains requires the expression of virulence factors that contribute to the invasiveness of the pathogen. In the presented study, we examined the occurrence of known virulence-associated factors in Sc. suis isolates from samples sent to the Institute of Microbiology, School of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, in order to evaluate their significance as potential virulence factors in different disease complexes in Northern Germany. The results show that (i) MRP + EF + serotype 2 and MRP* EF-serotype 9 strains are statistically significant associated with the disease complex meningitis/septicemia/arthritis and, thus, have to be considered invasive strains, (ii) serotyping alone is not sufficient for identification of virulent strains, (iii) there is a remarkable heterogeneity among pneumonia-associated Sc. suis strains and (iv) activity of haemolysin or suilysin appears to be not appropriate as virulence marker. Finally, it has to be noted that at present only half of the Sc. suis isolates from pigs with meningitis/septicemia/poyarthritis can be characterised by the detection of virulence-associated factors. Thus, the identification and characterisation of additional, serotype independent virulence factors of Sc. suis is a very important issue in future studies.
TI  - [Streptococcus suis infection, a zoonosis we should have in mind--2 case reports].
AB  - Streptococcus suis is primarily pig's pathogen, but can cause disease in a man exposed to contact with pigs (butchers, abatoir workers, farmers). Infection in man is most frequently manifested as purulent meningitis, with deafness and ataxia, but there are rare reports on septic shock with multiple organ failure and death. We report two patients with Streptococcus suis type 1 infection, treated in "Dr Josip Bencevic" General Hospital, Slavonski Brod. The first patient suffered a very abrupt and severe illness, with septic shock, multiple organ failure and lethal outcome. The second patient had purulent meningitis with deafness. Both of them had a defect in immunologic function before infection. They were probably infected during manipulation with pork meat at home. Our patients had infection with Streptococcus suis type 1, contrary to reports on prevalent human infection with type 2. It is necessary to make epidemiologic survey on human infection with that pathogen, especially in those professionally exposed to pigs and pork meat.
TI  - The structure of NADH in the enzyme dTDP-d-glucose dehydratase (RmlB).
AB  - The structure of Streptococcus suis serotype type 2 dTDP-d-glucose 4,6-dehydratase (RmlB) has been determined to 1.5 A resolution with its nicotinamide coenzyme and substrate analogue dTDP-xylose bound in an abortive complex. During enzyme turnover, NAD(+) abstracts a hydride from the C4' atom of dTDP-glucose-forming NADH. After elimination of water, hydride is then transferred back to the C6' atom of dTDP-4-keto-5,6-glucosene-regenerating NAD(+). Single-crystal spectroscopic studies unambiguously show that the coenzyme has been trapped as NADH in the crystal. Electron density clearly demonstrates that in contrast to native structures of RmlB where a flat nicotinamide ring is observed, the dihydropyridine ring of the reduced cofactor in this complex is found as a boat. The si face, from which the pro-S hydride is transferred, has a concave surface. Ab initio electronic structure calculations demonstrate that the presence of an internal hydrogen bond, between the amide NH on the nicotinamide ring and one of the oxygen atoms on a phosphate group, stabilizes this distorted conformation. Additionally, calculations show that the hydride donor ability of NADH is influenced by the degree of bending in the ring and may be influenced by an active-site tyrosine residue (Tyr 161). These results demonstrate the ability of dehydratase enzymes to fine-tune the redox potential of NADH through conformational changes in the nicotinamide ring.
TI  - Identification of an inducible bacteriophage in a virulent strain of Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis infection is considered to be a major problem in the swine industry worldwide. Most virulent Canadian isolates of S. suis serotype 2 do not produce the known virulence markers for this pathogen. PCR-based subtraction hybridization was adapted to isolate unique DNA sequences which were specific to virulent strains of S. suis isolated in Canada. Analysis of some subtracted DNA clones revealed significant homology with bacteriophages of gram-positive bacteria. An inducible phage (named Ss1) was observed in S. suis following the incubation of the virulent strain 89-999 with mitomycin C. Phage Ss1 has a long noncontractile tail and a small isometric nucleocapsid and is a member of the Siphoviridae family. Ss1 phage DNA appears to be present in most Canadian S. suis strains tested in this study, which were isolated from diseased pigs or had proven virulence in mouse or pig models. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the isolation of a phage in S. suis.
TI  - Streptococcus suis infection: clinical features and diagnostic pitfalls.
AB  - Eight cases of Streptococcus suis (S. suis) infection between 1993-1999 were retrospectively studied. There were 6 cases of meningitis and 2 cases of endocarditis. Acute meningitis with early sensorineural hearing loss was the characteristic feature and the most common presentation of S. suis infection. S. suis endocarditis is a rare presentation in Thailand. This organism was often mistaken for Streptococcus pneumoniae or Streptococcus viridans. In this study, this was true in five cases in whom S. suis was identified later. However, the rapid diagnosis of S. suis meningitis may rely on Gram stain of the CSF in the setting of acute meningitis with hearing loss. These cases were treated with intravenous penicillin or ampicillin with a mean duration of 4 weeks. This treatment was very effective and there was no relapse among these patients.
TI  - Cloning and partial characterization of the gene encoding the putative elongation factor Ts of Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis infection has a substantial impact on the swine industry. In addition, S. suis serotype 2 is recognized as a zoonotic agent. In this paper, we report the cloning and complete sequence of the gene coding for the putative elongation factor Ts ( tsf-like) of S. suis. The putative tsf gene seems to be transcribed from a promoter located within the cloned DNA fragment, as its expression is not dependent on insertional orientation within the plasmid. One copy of the tsf gene was detected in the chromosome of S. suis by Southern blot analysis. Interestingly, the elongation factor Ts expressed by all reference strains of all S. suis serotypes were antigenically similar, as determined by Western blot.

TI  - Production and properties of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances from the swine pathogen Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is a major pathogen found in the upper respiratory  tract of swine. In this study, isolates of this bacterial species were tested for the production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (BLIS). Of the 38 strains tested, four inhibited the growth of other S. suis isolates according to a deferred-antagonism plate assay. Interestingly, three of the strains were originally isolated from healthy carrier pigs and were considered nonvirulent. Three isolates (94-623, 90-1330, and AAH4) that produced BLIS in liquid broth were selected for further characterization. None of the inhibitory activities was related to the production of either organic acids or hydrogen peroxide. The BLIS produced by these strains were heat stable and proteinase K, pronase, and elastase sensitive but were trypsin and chymotrypsin resistant. They were stable at pH 2 and 12 and had molecular masses in the range of 14 to 30 kDa. Maximum production was observed during the mid-log phase. Following a curing procedure with novobiocin, only 90-1330 lost the ability to produce BLIS, suggesting that the BLIS might be plasmid encoded. Analysis of the inhibitory spectra revealed that the BLIS-producing strains also inhibited the growth of Actinobacillus minor, Actinobacillus porcinus, Enterococcus durans, Micrococcus luteus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae, Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus, and S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. This study reports for the first time the ability of the swine pathogen S. suis serotype 2 to produce BLIS with the characteristics of classic bacteriocins. Further studies are required to investigate the possibility of using bacteriocin-producing strains to prevent swine infections caused by virulent strains of S. suis serotype 2.
TI  - Comparison of experimental models for Streptococcus suis infection of conventional pigs.
AB  - Four different experimental models for Streptococcus suis-induced disease were compared to find a model that closely mimics naturally occurring disease in conventional pigs. Fourteen, 2-week old pigs free of S. suis type 2 were used in 2 experiments. In experiment 1, 3 pigs were inoculated intravenously (IV) and 3 pigs intranasally (IN) with S. suis. Two out of 3 of the IV-inoculated pigs exhibited signs of severe central nervous system disease (CNS) and were euthanized. Streptococcus suis type 2 was isolated from whole blood, joints, and serosal surfaces of both pigs. No clinical signs and no growth of S. suis were detected in the IN-inoculated pigs. In experiment 2, 4 pigs were inoculated IV and another 4 were inoculated IN with the same isolate as in experiment 1. One hour before inoculation the IN-inoculated pigs were given 5 mL of 1% acetic acid intranasally (IN-AA). All the IV-inoculated pigs showed CNS disease and lameness, and 2 of the pigs became severely affected and were euthanized. All the IN-AA inoculated pigs exhibited roughened hair coats and 2 pigs developed severe CNS disease and were euthanized. Streptococcus suis was isolated from the joints and blood of 3 pigs in the IV-inoculated group. Streptococcus suis was isolated from blood of 2 pigs, meninges of 3 pigs, and joints of 1 pig in the IN-AA inoculated group. Natural exposure to S. suis most likely occurs by the intranasal route. The IN-AA model should serve as a good model for S. suis-induced disease, because the natural route of exposure is intranasal and the IN-AA model was effective in inducing disease that mimics what is observed in the field.
TI  - [A Japanese case of Streptococcus suis meningitis associated with lumbar epidural abscess].
AB  - A 47-year-old man working at a meat processing factory was admitted to our hospital after suffering high fever and severe headache for a 2-day period. He was alert and showed no neurological symptoms apart from neck stiffness. The CSF was turbid, with 701/microliter of polymorphnuclear leukocytes, a protein concentration of 218 mg/ml, and a sugar concentration of 33 mg/dl. He was diagnosed as suffering from Streptococcus suis (S. suis) serotype 2 meningitis based on CSF culture. Severe headache and high fever subsided after the treatment with intravenous antibiotics and immunoglobin. He developed, however, severe lumbargo on the third day, which was proven to be caused by the lumbar epidural abscess. Also, on the 8th day he developed hearing loss. These symptoms were treated and ameliorated with the administration of dexamethasone. On the 73rd day, the patient was discharged in good clinical condition, although he still suffered from a decrease in hearing perception. S. suis, found as a commensal in the nasopharynx of swine, is responsible for meningitis in the people who are in close contact with swine or unprocessed pork. S. suis meningitis seems to be the result of a preventable occupational infection. Although most of the patients come from other countries in Asia, our patient is the first documented case occurring in Japan. Those who have an occupational exposure to swine and pork are strongly recommended to use protective gloves. Prevention through public health surveillance is important.

AB  
TI  - In vitro activities of florfenicol against bovine and porcine respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - Florfenicol in vitro activities for a total of 756 bacterial isolates from respiratory tract infections of cattle and swine were comparatively investigated by the agar diffusion method and the microdilution broth method. Florfenicol showed high in vitro activity against Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, and Streptococcus suis, with all of the isolates inhibited by </=2 micro g of florfenicol per ml.
TI  - Up-regulation of ICAM-1, CD11a/CD18 and CD11c/CD18 on human THP-1 monocytes stimulated by Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is known to be a major pathogen of swine, causing mainly meningitis. It is also a zoonotic agent leading predominantly to meningitis in humans working in close contact with pigs. In this study, we investigated the ability of S. suis to up-regulate the expression of adhesion molecules involved in inflammation, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. S. suis serotype 2 stimulated the up-regulation of the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1, CD54), CD11a/CD18 and CD11c/CD18 on human THP-1 monocytes, but did not change that of ICAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1, CD106) and E-selectin (CD62E) on human endothelial cells. The up-regulation of adhesion molecules was time- and bacterial concentration-dependent, and cell wall components were largely responsible for such stimulation. To a lesser extent, purified haemolysin of S. suis also stimulated adhesion molecule expression. Stimulation of monocytes with strains of different origin showed that there was no clear tendency for human strains to induce a higher expression of adhesion molecules than strains from diseased pigs. Finally, monocytes stimulated with S. suis also showed an increase in adherence to endothelial cells. Hence, S. suis is capable of up-regulating important adhesion molecules involved in inflammation, which may result in an increased leucocyte recruitment into sites of infection, thus providing a possible mechanism for some of the inflammatory features of meningitis caused by this pathogen.
TI  - [Purulent meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis in a pig breeder].
AB  - A case of Purulent meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis type 2 is reported here. It occurred in a 58-year-old male pig breeder. A few days before presentation, the patient had experienced headache, systemic articular pain and fever (38.8 degrees C). On admission, he was stuporous and had neck stiffness and hemiparesis. Examination of cerebrospinal fluid showed purulent meningitis. The cultures identified Streptococcus suis II by PCR and specific serum. 2 months later, the patient was discharged in good clinical condition except for hearing loss. Streptococcus suis is known to be an important pathogen in the swine industry, this report is the first case of S. suis meningitis in man, in Japan.
TI  - Analysis of genetic diversity of Streptococcus suis clinical isolates from pigs in Spain by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
AB  - Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to investigate the diversity of  Streptococcus suis isolates of various serotypes recovered from swine clinical samples in Spain. Capsular types 9 (64.9%) and 2 (14.8%) were the most frequently isolated serotypes followed by serotype 7 (5.9%) and serotype 8 (4.3%). The PFGE results of this study with 60 different pulsotypes indicate a great genetic diversity among the S. suis isolates, which is consistent with the broad distribution of S. suis in the swine population. Forty-five percent of the pulsotypes corresponded to single isolates, no pulsotype was common to all farms, and at least 3 different pulsotypes were isolated in 56% of herds in which more than 3 clinical isolates were analyzed. These results reveal a great diversity both between and within herds throughout the strains of S. suis studied, demonstrating that different strains of S. suis are associated with infection in pigs. Some pulsotypes were more frequently isolated and exhibited a wider distribution over herds than others, and were the unique or predominant strains in several herds, suggesting the existence of a prevalent or a few prevalent clones responsible for a large proportion of clinical cases. Overall, the great genetic heterogeneity of the clinical strains of S. suis, the isolation of different strains within the same herd, and the predominance of particular strains in some herds are evidence that infection by S. suis is a dynamic process and reinforce the idea that the epidemiology of S. suis infection is very complex.
TI  - High-resolution structures of RmlC from Streptococcus suis in complex with substrate analogs locate the active site of this class of enzyme.
AB  - Nature achieves the epimerization of carbohydrates by a variety of chemical routes. One common route is that performed by the class of enzyme defined by dTDP-6-deoxy-D-xylo-4-hexulose 3,5-epimerase (RmlC) from the rhamnose pathway. Earlier studies failed to identify the key residues in catalysis. We report the 1.3 A structure of RmlC from Streptococcus suis type 2 and its complexes with dTDP-D-glucose and dTDP-D-xylose. The streptococcal RmlC enzymes belong to a separate subgroup, sharing only 25% identity with RmlC from other bacteria, yet the S. suis enzyme has similar kinetic properties and structure to other RmlC enzymes. Structure, sequence alignment, and mutational analysis have now allowed reliable identification of the catalytic residues and their roles.
TI  - Lipoprotein signal peptidase of Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - This paper reports the complete coding sequence for a proliprotein signal peptidase (SP-ase) of Streptococcus suis, Lsp. This is believed to be the first SP-ase described for S. suis. SP-ase II is involved in the removal of the signal peptide from glyceride-modified prolipoproteins. By using in vitro transcription/translation systems, it was shown that the lsp gene was transcribed in vitro. Functionality of Lsp in Escherichia coli was demonstrated by using an in vitro globomycin resistance assay, to show that expression of Lsp in E. coli increased the globomycin resistance. An isogenic mutant of S. suis serotype 2 unable to produce Lsp was constructed and shown to process lipoproteins incorrectly, including an S. suis homologue of the pneumococcal PsaA lipoprotein. Five piglets were inoculated with a mixture of both strains in an experimental infection, to determine the virulence of the mutant strain relative to that of the wild-type strain in a competitive challenge experiment. The data showed that both strains were equally virulent, indicating that the knockout mutant of lsp is not attenuated in vivo.
TI  - Inter- and intraspecies variations of the 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region of various streptococcal species.
AB  - The 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer regions (ISR) of different streptococcal species and subspecies were amplified with primers derived from the highly conserved flanking regions of the 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA genes. The single sized amplicons showed a uniform pattern for S. agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae (serogroup C), S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (serogroup G), S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae (serogroup L), S. canis, S. phocae, S. uberis, S. parauberis, S. pyogenes and S. equi subsp. equi, respectively. The amplicons of S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, S. porcinus and S. suis appeared with 3, 5 and 3 different sizes, respectively. ISR of selected strains of each species or subspecies investigated were sequenced and multiple aligned. This allowed a separation of ISR into regions, with 7 regions for S. agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae (serogroup C), S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (serogroup G), S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae (serogroup L), S. canis, S. phocae, S. pyogenes and S. suis, 8 regions for S. uberis and S. parauberis and mostly 9 regions for S. equi subsp. equi, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus and S. porcinus. Region 4, encoding the transfer RNA for alanine (tRNA(Ala)), was present and identical for all isolates investigated. The size and sequence of ISR appears to be a unique marker for streptococci of various species and subspecies and could be used for bacterial identification. In addition the size and sequence variations of ISR of S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, S. porcinus and S. suis allows a molecular typing of isolates of these species possibly useful in epidemiological aspects.
TI  - Chloramphenicol resistance transposable element TnSs1 of Streptococcus suis, a transposon flanked by IS6-family elements.
AB  - A new transposon, designated TnSs1, which contains a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene flanked by direct repeats of an IS6-family element was found in a field isolate of Streptococcus suis. Polymerase chain reaction and hybridization analyses indicated that another field isolate carried the same transposon in a different location on the chromosome. A transposition assay done with a thermosensitive suicide vector showed that, among the seven TnSs1 mutants tested in this study, six formed a cointegrate between the S. suis genome and the vector with the generation of the third copy of the insertion sequence element, and one harbored one copy of TnSs1 on the chromosome as a result of a subsequent resolution step. On transposition, TnSs1 duplicated an 8-bp sequence at the target site.
TI  - [Streptococcus suis bacteremia].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Streptococcus suis infection is recognised despite it rareness as a zoonotic occupational disease in humans, and is often associated with meningitis, more rarely with bacteremia. OBSERVATION: A Streptococcus suis bacteremia occurred in a hunter and was complicated by septic shock with disseminated intravascular coagulation, rhabdomyolysis and purpura fulminans. Contamination had occurred through inoculation of a cut on the thumb when the hunter was slaughtering a wild boar. The blood cultures isolated Streptococcus suis. The patient died 36 hours after admission, despite intensive care and adapted antibiotic treatment with penicillin A and macrolide. CONCLUSION: Streptococcus suis bacteremia are uncommon but serious in humans. Despite adapted treatment, evolution may be fatal, so their conditions of occurrence must be well known by hunters and practitioners.
TI  - Mutagenesis of Streptococcus equi and Streptococcus suis by transposon Tn917.
AB  - Genetic tools for studying streptococci are much less sophisticated than those that are available for many other bacterial genera. In this paper, we describe the development of a transposon mutagenesis system that we have used to mutate two important veterinary streptococci, Streptococcus equi and Streptococcus suis. The system uses a temperature-sensitive suicide vector to deliver Tn917 via electroporation, transposing Tn917 into the chromosomal DNA of the two streptococci. The transposon insertions can be rescued from the streptococcal chromosomes by plasmid rescue and selection in E. coli, with subsequent insertion site analysis by DNA sequencing. Transposition appeared to have occurred in an essentially random fashion when chromosomal DNA of S. suis and S. equi mutants was analysed by Southern blotting. However, when analysis of 60 S. equi mutants was carried out using the S. equi genome sequence database, 60% of transposon insertions had occurred within a 15 kb region of the genome whereas the other insertions appeared to have occurred essentially randomly. This finding suggests that Southern blot analysis for assessing the randomness of transposon libraries may need to be interpreted with caution. However, this observation notwithstanding, the Tn917 based system described in this paper will facilitate the study of S. suis and S. equi.
TI  - Adult community acquired bacterial meningitis in a Singaporean teaching hospital. A seven-year overview (1993-2000).
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study is to describe the bacteriological, clinical and laboratory features of community acquired bacterial meningitis in adults admitted to a Singapore tertiary-care hospital. METHODS: Two hundred sixty-nine cases of meningitis or meningoencephalitis admitted between 1993 and 2000 were identified by their discharge diagnosis codes. All case records except for 57 which could not be retrieved were retrospectively reviewed. Patients less than 14 years or with skull fractures, post-neurosurgery or with indwelling intracranial devices were excluded. Inclusion criteria was a clinical picture compatible with a diagnosis of bacterial meningitis with either (1) positive cerebral-spinal fluid (CSF) cultures or latex coagglutination or CSF neutrophilic pleocytosis accompanied by positive blood cultures or (2) in the absence of positive blood cultures, CSF cultures and latex agglutination, presence of CSF pleocytosis of at least 100 neutrophils per microL. RESULTS: Fifteen "culture-positive" and 11 "culture negative" cases were identified. Six (55%) of the "culture-negative" cases received antibiotics prior to admission. Cultures grew Streptococcus pneumoniae in four cases, three cases each of Group B streptococci and Neisseria meningitides. Listeria monocytogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae were each seen twice and Streptococcus suis once. All cases of Group B streptococci occurred in the year 1998. Mortality was 19% (n = 5), six developed infections in other sites, three epileptic seizures, three developed hydrocephalus, and two hearing loss. CONCLUSIONS: Pathogens are similar to those reported in other studies but for an outbreak of Group B Streptococcus in 1998. There were a high number of "culture-negative" cases which may be due to preceding antibiotic intervention.
TI  - Identification and characterization of four proteases produced by Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important worldwide swine pathogen. In this study, we investigated the production of proteases by S. suis serotype 2. Proteases were identified and characterized using chromogenic and fluorogenic assays and zymography. An Arg-aminopeptidase with a molecular mass of 55 kDa was found to be both cell-associated and extracellular. Cell-associated chymotrypsin-like and caseinase activities, belonging to the serine- and metalloprotease classes respectively, were also detected. Lastly, a dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) with a molecular mass of 70 kDa was detected in both whole cells and culture supernatants of S. suis serotype 2. Arg-aminopeptidase, caseinase and DPP IV activities were detected in all strains of S. suis serotype 2 tested whereas the chymotrypsin-like activity was only detected in European virulent strains of serotype 2. The optimum pH for all four proteases was between 6 and 8, and the optimum temperature ranged from 25 to 42 degrees C. This is the first report on the production of proteases by S. suis. Further investigations will determine the possible contribution of these proteases in the pathogenicity of S. suis serotype 2.
TI  - Allelic variation in srtAs of Streptococcus suis strains.
AB  - Streptococcus suis NCTC10234 possesses five srtA homologs: srtA encodes sortase,  which anchors surface proteins with an LPXTG motif to the cell wall, while the functions of the other four homologs (the srtBCD cluster and srtE) remain unknown. The genetic organization of the srtA region was found to be conserved in the 59 S. suis strains examined in this study. Although the srtAs in three of these strains showed strong sequence divergence, their functions were verified to be overlapping by genetic complementation, indicating the functional conservation of srtAs during the evolution of these strains. These results indicate the importance of an srtA-mediated cell wall sorting system for displaying proteins on the surface of S. suis.
TI  - Role of suilysin in pathogenesis of Streptococcus suis capsular serotype 2.
AB  - Three suilysin (SLY) knockout mutant strains of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 were generated by allelic replacement from one North American and two European wild type strains. The mutants were characterized by Southern blot, Western blot and phenotyping. In vitro bactericidal testing showed that both wild type and SLY mutants were resistant to bactericidal factors in whole pig blood. To demonstrate the role of SLY during S. suis infection, four animal trials were carried out using young pigs. Either high dose (4 x 10(6)CFU/ml/pig) or low dose (0.5 x 10(6)CFU/ml/pig) live cell aerosol was applied to the pharynx. In one trial, a low challenge dose of North American strain SX332 and its isogenic sly(-) mutant strain (SX932) resulted in acute disease in 3/5 of pigs exposed to the wild type strain, while 5/5 of pigs exposed to the mutant strain survived the trial. In the repeat trial, 1/8 of pigs in wild type group and 6/8 of pigs in mutant group developed disease. The high dose trial with 332/932 pair showed that 4/8 pigs challenged with wild type and 5/8 of pigs challenged with mutant strain developed disease respectively. The third low dose trial, using European strain 31533 and its isogenic sly(-) mutant strain SX911, showed that 1/8 of pigs challenged with the wild type strain and 4/8 of pigs challenged with the corresponding mutant strain developed disease. All the diseased pigs showed fever, clinical signs and developed septicemia. S. suis was isolated from tissue samples such as brain, submandibular lymph node, lung, spleen, liver, heart or joint. Serum antibody titer against cell surface proteins changed little while the antibody titer against SLY increased only in the wild type group after challenge. sly gene was cloned and expressed in E. coli. The recombinant SLY (rSLY) protein showed 800 hemolysin units per microg protein. In vitro study showed that rSLY triggered TNFalpha production by human monocytes and IL-6 production by pig pulmonary alveolar macrophages and monocytes. Thus, the results of this study suggest that SLY does not seem to be a critical virulence factor for S. suis serotype 2 respiratory infection, but by stimulating cytokine release it may play a role in innate immunity.
TI  - Pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine release by human brain microvascular endothelial cells stimulated by Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is a world-wide agent of diseases among pigs including meningitis, septicemia and arthritis. This microorganism is also recognized as an important zoonotic agent. The pathogenesis of the meningitis caused by S. suis is poorly understood. We have previously shown that S. suis is able to adhere to human brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC), but not to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). The objective of this work was to study the ability of S. suis serotype 2 to induce the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 (IL-1); IL-6 and the chemokines IL-8 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) by human BMEC and HUVEC, using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. S. suis was able to stimulate the production of IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1 by BMEC but not HUVEC, in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Bacterial cell wall components were largely responsible for such stimulation. The human and pig origin of strains does not seem to affect the intensity of the response; indeed, a very heterogeneous pattern of cytokine and chemokine production was observed for the different strains tested in this study. In situ production of cytokines and chemokines by BMEC may be the result of specific adhesion of S. suis to this cell type, with several consequences such as increased recruitment of leukocytes and an increase in the blood-brain barrier permeability.
TI  - A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay specific for Streptococcus suis based on  the gene encoding the glutamate dehydrogenase.
AB  - Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers that flank a 688-bp segment within the glutamate dehydrogenase gene (gdh) of Streptococcus suis type 2 could amplify efficiently the DNA of all 306 (100%) clinical S. suis isolates tested (pigs, n=305; human, n=1) encompassing all serotypes obtained from diverse organs, and geographic origins. When DNA from other bacteria were used as templates for amplification, no product was detected indicating specificity of the primers. Multiplex PCR was developed using the gdh gene primer pair and primers that targeted the gene encoding S. suis capsular biosynthesis (cps). This strategy enabled the detection of strains belonging to serotypes 1/2, 1, 2, 7, and 9, respectively. Using the multiplex-PCR technique, 12 out of 14 (86%) isolates that were previously identified as non-typable S. suis (based on biochemical reactions and serology) gave positive PCR results of which four were positive for serotype 7, three for serotype 2, and five for S. suis strains that belong to other serotypes. Retest results of all 14 isolates by several veterinary laboratories were identical with PCR and confirmed that the two non-PCR reactive isolates belonged to strains of other streptococcal species. These results indicated that PCR improved species determination and can thus be used as a reliable species-specific molecular diagnostic reagent for the accurate identification of S. suis isolates and a serotype-specific method for the detection of strains of serotypes 1/2, 1, 2, 7, and 9, respectively. The PCR method therefore has potential clinical and epidemiological applications.
TI  - [Analysis of virulence-related proteins of Streptococcus suis type 2 from swine Streptococcus isolated in China].
AB  - Virulence-related proteins, muraminidase-released protein (MRP) and extracellular factor (EF) of Streptococcus suis type 2, were extracted from Jiangsu Isolate HA9801 and were used as antigens for preparation of antibodies. Bacterium cell envelope proteins and extracellular proteins of swine Streptococcus strains including 17 Chinese isolates, 1 German strain and 1 human isolate of Streptococcus suis type 2, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using the above antibodies, 11 strains produced MRP and 10 strains possessed EF or EF. They exist four phenotypes: MRP+ EF+ (8/19), MRP+ EF (1/19), MRP+ EF- (1/19), MRP- EF- (10/19).
TI  - Clonal distribution of an atypical MRP+, EF*, and suilysin+ phenotype of virulent Streptococcus suis serotype 2 strains in Brazil.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is considered one of the most important bacterial swine pathogens worldwide. The distribution of the 35 described serotypes in diseased animals may vary in different regions. Data regarding S. suis isolation from pigs in South America is not available. In the present study, 51 isolates of S. suis recovered in pure culture or as the predominant species from diseased animals in Brazil, were analyzed. These isolates were classified as serotypes 2 (58.8%), 3 (21.5%), 7 (13.7%), 1 (3.9%), and 14 (2%). Serotype 2 isolates were further studied for their production of virulence-related proteins muramidase-released protein (MRP), extracellular factor (EF), and suilysin. In addition, the genetic diversity was studied by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA. All but 1 of the serotype 2 isolates showed a clonal distribution of an atypical phenotype (MRP+, EF*, suilysin+), different from the known European (MRP+, EF+, suilysin+), and North American (MRPv, EF-, suilysin-), phenotypes.
TI  - Streptococcus suis infection: overview of case reports in Thailand.
AB  - This paper presents an overview of reports of Streptococcus suis infection in Thailand from 1987-2000. Nine reports (N=27 samples) have been collected and analyzed descriptively. The demographic data and clinical data showed 15 samples (55.6%) of all samples had a history of contact with pig, raw pork product or a history of raw pork, or uncooked pig's blood, consumption. The ages of the patients ranged from 23 to 72 years (mean 47 +/- 8.91). Most presented with fever (N=27, 100%), headache (N=11, 40.74%) and neck stiffness (N=13, 48.15%). Twelve (44.44%) cases developed septic shock, and only one survived with loss of hearing ability. Two cases were the first report of human S. suis endocarditis from Thailand. One case was probably the first case report of S. suis peritonitis. Laboratory results and treatment have been also reviewed and may highlight the importance of microbiological laboratories that have limited facilities for identification of the organism.
TI  - Molecular basis of H2O2 resistance mediated by Streptococcal Dpr. Demonstration of the functional involvement of the putative ferroxidase center by site-directed mutagenesis in Streptococcus suis.
AB  - H(2)O(2) is an unavoidable cytotoxic by-product of aerobic life. Dpr, a recently  discovered member of the Dps protein family, provides a means for catalase-negative bacteria to tolerate H(2)O(2). Potentially, Dpr could bind free intracellular iron and thus inhibit the Fenton chemistry-catalyzed formation of toxic hydroxyl radicals (H(2)O(2) + Fe(2+) --> (.)OH + (-)OH + Fe(3+)). We explored the in vivo function of Dpr in the catalase- and NADH peroxidase-negative pig and human pathogen Streptococcus suis. We show that: (i) a Dpr allelic exchange knockout mutant was hypersensitive ( approximately 10(6)-fold) to H(2)O(2), (ii) Dpr incorporated iron in vivo, (iii) a putative ferroxidase center was present in Dpr, (iv) single amino acid substitutions D74A or E78A to the putative ferroxidase center abolished the in vivo iron incorporation, and (v) the H(2)O(2) hypersensitive phenotype was complemented by wild-type Dpr or by a membrane-permeating iron chelator, but not by the site-mutated forms of Dpr. These results demonstrate that the putative ferroxidase center of Dpr is functionally active in iron incorporation and that the H(2)O(2) resistance is mediated by Dpr in vivo by its iron binding activity.
TI  - Identification and characterization of two temperature-induced surface-associated proteins of Streptococcus suis with high homologies to members of the Arginine Deiminase system of Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - The present study was performed to identify stress-induced putative virulence proteins of Streptococcus suis. For this, protein expression patterns of streptococci grown at 32, 37, and 42 degrees C were compared by one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Temperature shifts from 32 and 37 to 42 degrees C induced expression of two cell wall-associated proteins with apparent molecular masses of approximately 47 and 53 kDa. Amino-terminal sequence analysis of the two proteins indicated homologies of the 47-kDa protein with an ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OCT) from Streptococcus pyogenes and of the 53-kDa protein with the streptococcal acid glycoprotein (SAGP) from S. pyogenes, an arginine deiminase (AD) recently proposed as a putative virulence factor. Cloning and sequencing the genes encoding the putative OCT and AD of S. suis, octS and adiS, respectively, revealed that they had 81.2 (octS) and 80.2% (adiS) identity with the respective genes of S. pyogenes. Both genes belong to the AD system, also found in other bacteria. Southern hybridization analysis demonstrated the presence of the adiS gene in all 42 serotype 2 and 9 S. suis strains tested. In 9 of these 42 strains, selected randomly, we confirmed expression of the AdiS protein, homologous to SAGP, by immunoblot analysis using a specific antiserum against the SAGP of S. pyogenes. In all strains AD activity was detected. Furthermore, by immunoelectron microscopy using the anti-S. pyogenes SAGP antiserum we were able to demonstrate that the AdiS protein is expressed on the streptococcal surface in association with the capsular polysaccharides but is not coexpressed with them.
TI  - Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) coinfections in US field cases of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS).
AB  - The prevalence of different pathogens detected in combination with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) was studied retrospectively in field cases of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) diagnosed at the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, Ames, Iowa, between January 2000, and September 2001. The presence of PCV-2 antigen in lymphoid tissues and/or lung, demonstrated by immunohistochemistry, together with moderate to severe lymphoid depletion and/or granulomatous lymphadenitis, was used as the criteria for the diagnosis of PMWS. A total of 484 cases fulfilled these criteria. Most of the cases (294/369) of PMWS occurred in pigs between the ages of 8 and 18 weeks, with a peak at 10 weeks of age. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus was detected in 51.9% of the cases, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae in 35.5%, bacterial septicemia in 14.0%, bacterial pneumonia in 7.6%, swine influenza virus in 5.4%, and PCV-2 alone in 1.9%. In cases with bacterial septicemia the most frequently isolated pathogen was Streptococcus suis. In cases with bacterial pneumonia, Pasteurella multocida was the most prevalent.
TI  - Genetic diversity of Streptococcus suis serotypes 2 and 1/2 isolates recovered from carrier pigs in closed herds.
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare, by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), the diversity of Streptococcus suis serotypes 1/2 and 2 isolates recovered at slaughter houses from the tonsils of clinically healthy pigs. The pigs belonged to herds with or without clinical signs of S. suis disease. Overall, a low diversity was observed among isolates of serotype 1/2. A representative isolate recovered from a diseased animal presented a relatively high similarity (85%), with most isolates recovered from carrier pigs, from herds either with or without clinical signs of S. suis disease. For serotype 2 isolates, a relatively high degree of heterogeneity was observed in the whole population. Two subpopulations were observed for serotype 2 isolates, which arose from herds with clinical signs. Interestingly, the representative isolate coming from the diseased pig was included in a small closed cluster, with 2 isolates recovered from carrier pigs belonging to the same herd. On the other hand, most of the S. suis serotype 2 isolates originating from herds with no history of S. suis disease, were closely related (90% similarity). Furthermore, they presented different RAPD patterns from those originating from animals from the herd presenting S. suis clinical signs due to this serotype. Results suggest that, in the herds studied, clinical manifestations due to serotype 2 are probably related to the virulence of a specific isolate. Conversely, for the herd affected with serotype 1/2, clinical manifestations of the disease were more likely to be the result of inherent herd factors than the virulence of the specific isolate.
TI  - Response regulator important in pathogenesis of Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - In this study, we describe the first response regulator of Streptococcus suis serotype 2, designated RevS. RevS was cloned and the sequence was determined. No histidine kinase was found in the vicinity ofrevS, therefore RevS was considered to be an orphan response regulator. An isogenic knock-out mutant of RevS was shown to be attenuated in colonising the S. suis specific organs in a competitive assay in four piglets, indicating thatrevS plays a role in the pathogenesis of S. suis infections. We analysed the protein expression profiles of various fractions of the wild-type strain 10 and the mutant strain 10DeltaRevS. The expression of known virulence factors ofS. suis by wild-type and the mutant strain, was not different. However, one protein in the protoplast fraction, with unknown identity was shown to be repressed by revS in the exponential growth phase of the mutant.
TI  - Streptococcus suis infection as a cause of severe illness: 2 cases from Croatia.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is a zoonotic agent that can be spread to humans, e.g. butchers, abattoir workers and farmers, by contact with pigs. Human infection is most frequently manifested as purulent meningitis, in combination with deafness and ataxia, but there have been rare reports of septic shock leading to multiorgan failure and death. We report 2 patients with S. suis type 1 infection. One patient suffered an abrupt and severe illness, with septic shock leading to multiorgan failure and death, whereas the other presented with purulent meningitis and deafness. Both patients were immunocompromised. They were most likely infected as a result of handling pork at home. In both cases, the infection was due to S. suis type 1, in contrast to previous reports indicating an association between human infection and S. suis type 2. Epidemiologic surveys of human infection may be of interest, especially among individuals exposed to pigs and pork.
TI  - What happened to the streptococci: overview of taxonomic and nomenclature changes.
AB  - Since the division of the Streptococcus genus into enterococci, lactococci, and streptococci in 1984, many changes in the nomenclature and taxonomy of the Streptococcus genus have taken place. The application of genetic comparisons has improved the proper classification of the different species. The Lancefield system of serogrouping the streptococci by the expression of beta-hemolysis on blood agar plates is still very useful for the identification of streptococci for patient management. The Lancefield grouping system cannot be used in itself for accurate identification of specific beta-hemolytic species, but it can be a useful part of the identification procedure. Except for identification of the "Streptococcus bovis group" of species and Streptococcus suis, Lancefield grouping is of little value in identification of the non-beta-hemolytic streptococci and related genera. In fact, identification of the non-beta-hemolytic species is problematic for conventional as well as commercially available identification procedures. A combination of conventional tests and specific chromogenic tests suggested by several investigators is presented and discussed. Tables are included that suggest tests and procedures to guide investigators attempting to identify all the species.
TI  - Development of a multilocus sequence typing scheme for the pig pathogen Streptococcus suis: identification of virulent clones and potential capsular serotype exchange.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important pathogen of pigs and occasionally causes serious human disease. However, little is known about the S. suis population structure, the clonal relationships between strains, the potential of particular clones to cause disease, and the relevance of serotype as a marker for epidemiology. Here we describe a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme for S. suis developed in order to begin to address these issues. Seven housekeeping gene fragments from each of 294 S. suis isolates obtained from various S. suis diseases and from asymptomatic carriage representing 28 serotypes and nine distinct countries of origin were sequenced. Between 32 and 46 alleles per locus were identified, giving the ability to distinguish >1.6 x 10(11) sequence types (STs). However only 92 STs were identified in this study. Of the 92 STs 18 contained multiple isolates, the most common of which, ST1, was identified on 141 occasions from six countries. Assignment of the STs to lineages resulted in 37 being identified as unique and unrelated STs while the remaining 55 were assigned to 10 complexes. ST complexes ST1, ST27, and ST87 dominate the population; while the ST1 complex was strongly associated with isolates from septicemia, meningitis, and arthritis, the ST87 and ST27 complexes were found to contain significantly higher numbers of lung isolates. In agreement with the observed distribution of disease-causing isolates of S. suis, most isolates previously characterized as of high virulence in porcine infection models belong to ST1, while isolates belonging to other STs appear to be less virulent in general. Finally nine STs were found to contain isolates of multiple serotypes, and many isolates belonging to the same serotypes were found to have very disparate genetic backgrounds. As well as highlighting that the serotype can often be a poor indicator of genetic relatedness between S. suis isolates, these findings suggest that capsular genes may be moving horizontally through the S. suis population.
TI  - Expression, purification and crystallization of Dpr, a ferritin-like protein from the Gram-positive meningitis-associated bacterium Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Ferritin-like proteins form a novel family of bacterial proteins with diverse functions, such as DNA binding, iron storage and cell activation. A common structural feature of these proteins is their ability to form spherical dodecamers. Dpr is a ferritin-like protein from the Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus suis. Full-length and truncated Dpr were expressed and purified as 6xHis-tag fusion proteins. Crystals of truncated Dpr suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis were obtained after the removal of the N-terminal affinity tag by thrombin cleavage. A complete data set to 2.3 A resolution was collected using synchrotron radiation. The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 104.3, b = 137.6, c = 142.1 A and 12 molecules in the asymmetric unit.
TI  - Antibodies to selected viral and bacterial pathogens in European wild boars from  southcentral Spain.
AB  - Serum samples from 78 European wild boars (Sus scrofa) harvested during the 1999-2000 hunting season were tested for antibodies to Brucella spp., classical swine fever virus, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, Haemophilus parasuis, Leptospira interrogans serovar pomona, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, pseudorabies virus (PRV), porcine parvovirus (PPV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, Salmonella serogroups B, C, and D, Streptococcus suis, and swine influenza virus (SIV) serotypes H1N1 and H3N2. Samples were collected from Sierra Morena and Montes de Toledo in southcentral Spain. Antibodies were detected to PRV (36%), L. interrogans serovar pomona (12%), PPV (10%), E. rhusiopathiae (5%), SIV serotype H1N1 (4%), Salmonella serogroup B (4%), and Salmonella serogroup C (3%). Our results suggest that more research is needed to describe the epidemiology of infectious diseases of Spanish wild boars.
TI  - Distribution of environmentally regulated genes of Streptococcus suis serotype 2  among S. suis serotypes and other organisms.
AB  - The occurrence of 36 environmentally regulated genes of Streptococcus suis strain 10 among all 35 S. suis serotypes was determined by using hybridization with the amplified genes as probes. In addition, the distribution of these genes among the virulence phenotypes of serotypes 1 and 2 was assessed. Hybridization was also performed with various other streptococcal species and nonstreptococcal bacterial species which may be present in pigs. Interestingly, probe ivs-25/iri-1, similar to agrA and sapR, hybridized only with S. suis serotype 1 and 2 strains with virulent phenotypes and is therefore suitable as a diagnostic parameter. Only one probe was specific for S. suis. This probe's sequence was identical to the epf gene, a putative virulence factor of S. suis. Probe ivs-31 was similar to a virulence factor of S. suis, namely, a gene encoding a fibronectin- and fibrinogen-binding protein. This probe hybridized only with oral streptococci. Nearly half of the probes (45%) hybridized with the oral streptococci (S. oralis, S. milleri, S. sanguis, S. gordonii, and S. mitis) and with Streptococcus pneumoniae. This indicates a close relationship between S. suis, the oral streptococci, and S. pneumoniae with respect to the selected environmentally regulated genes. One probe only hybridized with gram-negative species and therefore seems to be obtained by S. suis from a gram-negative organism by horizontal transfer.
TI  - Streptococcus suis infection in Thailand.
AB  - This is a retrospective study of Streptococcus suis infection in humans submitted to the National Streptococcal Referrence Center of Thailand from 1994 to 2001. There were 11 men and 6 women whose mean age was 46.24 years (range 1 month to 75 years). Among the men, two had known occupational and behavioral exposure to pork or meat products. Among the women, one was a butcher and three were housewives. Half of the patients had underlying diseases. One patient had congenital hydrocephalus, three patients had rheumatic heart disease and three were alcoholics. Two of these patients had a history of skin injury before infection. Nine patients had evidence of acute bacterial meningitis, four patients had infective endocarditis, two had the sepsis syndrome and two suffered from pneumonia and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The authors suspected that many cases are not reported particularly where pig-rearing or pork consumption are common. In the absence of an effective vaccine, prevention by public health surveillance is important. Prompt treatment of any cuts and wounds among pork-handlers is a sensible precaution. Furthermore, a high index of suspicion and early detection in order to identify and apply effective antimicrobial agents is necessary to successfully treat S. suis infection.
TI  - Septic shock caused by Streptococcus suis: case report and investigation of a risk group.
AB  - A case of septic shock caused by Streptococcus suis type 2 occurred in a 36-year-old truck driver who transported pigs. Here, as well as in nearly all other cases of S. suis infections reported to date, close occupational contact with pork or pigs preceded the incident. This epidemiological link may be explained by the frequent occurrence of S. suis as a commensal and opportunistic germ in pigs. In order to assess the potential risk for an infection with S. suis, 132 workers in pig slaughtering, pork dissecting and processing industries were examined in a cross sectional study for the occurrence of S. suis in their pharynx, and compared with an age and sex matched control group. The evaluation of the pharyngeal swabs showed an atypical colonisation by a variety of microorganisms in some of the employees who were so far healthy, but potentially at risk. The colonisation of the case group with S. suis amounted to 5.3%.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of Streptococcus suis isolated from swine in France  and from humans in different countries between 1996 and 2000.
AB  - The susceptibility of 135 Streptococcus suis strains isolated from pigs (n = 110) and from humans (n = 25) to 13 antimicrobial agents was studied by microdilution and disc diffusion methods using Mueller-Hinton Agar II (MH) supplemented with either defibrinated sheep blood (MHSB) or horse serum (MHHS). Results were similar for both methods used except for penicillin G whose zone diameters were reduced with MHSB compared with MHHS. When MH was supplemented with sheep blood, 39% of S. suis strains classified as penicillin susceptible by MHHS microdilution showed intermediate susceptibility. Nearly all strains were susceptible to penicillin G (except by disc diffusion in MHSB), amoxicillin, ceftiofur, florfenicol, gentamicin and bacitracin. The least active antimicrobial agents were doxycycline and macrolides/lincosamides. High-level resistance (MIC > 500 mg/L or zone diameters < 10 mm) to streptomycin and kanamycin was detected in only a few strains. The virulence of strains did not seem to be related to antimicrobial resistance because no statistical difference was reported between the proportion of resistant strains of S. suis isolated from pigs with meningitis, septicaemia and arthritis, and those from tonsils and nasal cavities. However, significant differences were found in the proportions of macrolide- or doxycycline-resistant strains between S. suis serotype 2 and other serotypes. The results of antibiotic susceptibility testing presented in this study indicate that beta-lactams can be used in empirical treatment of human and pig S. suis infections in France.
TI  - Multiplex PCR assays for simultaneous detection of six major serotypes and two virulence-associated phenotypes of Streptococcus suis in tonsillar specimens from pigs.
AB  - Multiplex PCR assays for the detection and identification of various Streptococcus suis strains in tonsillar specimens from pigs were developed and evaluated. In two separate reactions, five distinct DNA targets were amplified. Three targets, based on the S. suis capsular polysaccharide (cps) genes specific for serotypes 1 (and 14), 7, and 9, were amplified in multiplex PCR I. Two other targets, based on the serotype 2- (and 1/2-) specific cps gene and the epf gene, encoding the EF proteins of virulent serotype 2 and highly virulent serotype 1 strains, were amplified in multiplex PCR II. To identify false-negative results, firefly luciferase (luc) DNA and primers based on the luc gene were included in the assay. The multiplex PCR assays were evaluated with tonsillar specimens from pigs infected with S. suis strains. The results obtained with the PCR assays were compared with the results obtained with a bacteriological examination. Most (94%) of the results obtained with multiplex PCR assays were confirmed by the bacteriological examination. The PCR method seems to be more sensitive compared to the bacteriological method, since the remaining 6% of the samples were positive by PCR and negative by bacteriological examination. These results indicate that the PCR method is highly specific for the detection of S. suis strains most frequently involved in clinical disease in infected pig herds. The serotypes found by PCR in tonsillar specimens from diseased pigs were compared with the serotypes of the strains isolated from the affected tissues of the same pigs. The results showed that there is significant association between carriership and clinical illness for S. suis serotype 9 and EF-positive serotype 2 strains and not for serotype 7 and EF-negative serotype 2 (or 1/2) strains.
TI  - Streptococcus gallinaceus sp. nov., from chickens.
AB  - Three isolates of an unknown Gram-positive, catalase-negative, chain-forming, coccus-shaped organism isolated from an outbreak of septicaemia in a flock of adult broiler parents were characterized by phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies demonstrated that the bacterium represents a new subline within the genus Streptococcus, related to, albeit distinct from, Streptococcus acidominimus, Streptococcus ovis, Streptococcus suis and close relatives. The unknown bacterium was readily distinguished from all recognized streptococcal species by biochemical tests. Based on phylogenetic and phenotypic evidence, it is proposed that the unknown bacterium from chickens be classified as Streptococcus gallinaceus sp. nov. The type strain is CCUG 42692T (= CIP 107087T).
TI  - Plasma haptoglobin concentration in swine after challenge with Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Eight 15-week-old pigs, reared under specific pathogen-free conditions, were inoculated with Streptococcus suis serotype 2. The animals were monitored before and after challenge by measuring rectal temperature, recording specific clinical symptoms and collecting blood samples for haptoglobin determination. Twenty-four hours after infection, the average haptoglobin plasma concentration of the animal group increased significantly and reached a maximum 4 days post-inoculation, followed by a constant mean level until the end of the trial on day 10. In spite of individual differences between the animals, an increase in haptoglobin concentration of at least 2.5 times above normal was observed in all infected pigs 1 day after challenge. Twenty-four hours after challenge, lameness was observed in five animals and an elevated body temperature was observed in seven of the eight experimental infected animals. These are the classical clinical symptoms of streptococcal infection. Haptoglobin was shown to increase in acute S. suis infection in pigs.
TI  - Bacterial colonization and invasion in pigs experimentally exposed to Streptococcus suis serotype 2 in aerosol.
AB  - A recently developed porcine model for aerogenous infection with Streptococcus suis serotype 2 was applied in a study of the phases of bacterial colonization and initial invasion. Eighteen pigs were exposed to aerosolized S. suis serotype 2 after pre-exposure to mild acetic acid in aerosol. The animals were killed consecutively within the first six days after challenge. After death, all animals were necropsied and examined by bacteriology, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry. Systemic infection was established in four out of 18 animals exposed to S. suis serotype 2. All systemically infected animals developed clinical signs and lesions typical of the infection. In four additional animals, subclinical infection was demonstrated by re-isolation of S. suis from the palatine tonsil. However, in all 18 challenged animals, immunohistochemistry demonstrated S. suis serotype 2 antigen in the palatine and/or nasopharyngeal tonsils. In all four systemically infected animals, S. suis serotype 2 antigen was also found in the mandibular lymph node. These observations point towards the tonsils as possible portals of entry for S. suis serotype 2 with subsequent lymphogenous spread. Thus, the present findings parallel the proposed pathogenesis for S. suis serotype 1 infection in pigs.
TI  - Streptococcus suis interactions with the murine macrophage cell line J774: adhesion and cytotoxicity.
AB  - Streptococcus suis capsular type 2 is an important etiological agent of swine meningitis, and it is also a zoonotic agent. Since one hypothesis of the pathogenesis of S. suis infection is that bacteria enter the bloodstream and invade the meninges and other tissues in close association with mononuclear phagocytes, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the capacity of S. suis type 2 to adhere to macrophages. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique was standardized to simply and accurately measure the rate of bacterial attachment to phagocytic cells. Results were confirmed by plate counting. Adhesion was dependent on bacterial concentration and incubation time and was not affected by cytochalasin pretreatment of macrophages. Inhibition studies showed that the sialic acid moiety of the S. suis capsule would be, at least in part, responsible for bacterial recognition by macrophages. Serum preopsonization of bacteria increased adhesion levels. Complement would be partially implicated in the serum-enhanced binding of S. suis to cells. Adhesion varied among different S. suis type 2 isolates. However, high bacterial concentrations of several isolates were cytotoxic for cells, and these cytotoxic effects correlated with suilysin production. Indeed, hemolytic strain supernatants, as well as purified suilysin, reproduced cytotoxic effects observed with live bacteria, and these effects were inhibited by cholesterol pretreatment. Bacterial adhesion and cytotoxicity were confirmed by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. We hypothesize that attachment of bacteria to phagocytes could play an important role in the pathogenesis of S. suis infection by allowing bacterial dissemination and causing a bacteremia and/or septicemia. This interaction could also be related to the activation of the host inflammatory response observed during meningitis.
TI  - Changes in the leucocyte subpopulations of the palatine tonsillar crypt epithelium of pigs in response to Streptococcus suis type 2 infection.
AB  - The tonsils are portal of entry and a site of multiplication and persistence for  a variety of pathogens, including Streptococcus suis (S. suis), which is a common cause of meningitis, septicemia and arthritis in pigs. Understanding the early changes that occur in the first barrier of the tonsil, i.e. the crypt epithelium, in response to S. suis infection is critical in clarifying the pathogenesis of this disease and for the future development of efficient methods of mucosal vaccination. In this study, we investigated the early changes, from 18 to 72 h, that occur in leucocyte subpopulations of the crypt epithelium of the palatine tonsils of 3-week-old pigs in response to S. suis type 2 infection. Monoclonal antibodies against leucocyte markers CD3, CD4, CD8, gammadelta T cell receptor, lambda-immunoglobulin light-chain, myeloid cells, and major histocompatibility complex class II molecule (MHC-II) were used in an avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase technique. An increase in the number of lambda-immunoglobulin light-chain positive cells (B cell subset) was noticed in crypts of S. suis-infected animals from 18 h after infection onwards. This increase was significant at 18 and 48 h after infection. The number of CD4 and CD8 cells was greater from 18 h onwards, with a significant increase at 24 and 72 h post-infection. No significant difference in numbers of CD3, gammadelta T cell receptor and MHC-II positive cells was detected in the crypts of infected animals compared to controls. Macrophages, neutrophils and crypt epithelial cells stained positively with the myeloid marker, and the area of crypt epithelium positive for this marker was increased in the crypts of infected animals, with a significant difference detected at 24 and 72 h after infection. These results suggest that there is participation of the innate immunity in the early phase of S. suis infection, represented by neutrophils, macrophages and likely epithelial cells, and that there is a potential for the initiation of both humoral and cellular responses against S. suis within the crypt epithelium of the palatine tonsil.
TI  - Biofilm bacteria: formation and comparative susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  - The Calgary Biofilm Device (CBD) was used to form bacterial biofilms of selected  veterinary gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria from cattle, sheep, pigs, chicken, and turkeys. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of ampicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, oxytetracycline, penicillin G, streptomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and trimethoprim-sulfadoxine for gram-positive and -negative bacteria were determined. Bacterial biofilms were readily formed on the CBD under selected conditions. The biofilms consisted of micro-colonies encased in extracellular polysaccharide material. Biofilms composed of Arcanobacterium (Actinomyces) pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hyicus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium renale, or Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were not killed by the antibiotics tested but as planktonic bacteria they were sensitive at low concentrations. Biofilm and planktonic Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Streptococcus suis were sensitive to penicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, ampicillin, and oxytetracycline. Planktonic Escherichia coli were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline and trimethoprim/ sulfadoxine. Enrofloxacin and gentamicin were the most effective antibiotics against E. coli growing as a biofilm. Salmonella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates growing as planktonic populations were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfadoxine, but as a biofilm, these bacteria were only sensitive to enrofloxacin. Planktonic and biofilm Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica had similar antibiotic sensitivity profiles and were sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested. The CBD provides a valuable new technology that can be used to select antibiotics that are able to kill bacteria growing as biofilms.
TI  - Streptococcus entericus sp. nov., isolated from cattle intestine.
AB  - Biochemical, molecular chemical and molecular genetic studies were performed on an unknown gram-positive, catalase-negative, coccus-shaped organism isolated from the intestine of a cow affected with catarrhal enteritis. The organism was tentatively identified as a streptococcal species based on results of cellular morphological and biochemical tests. 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies confirmed its provisional identification as a member of the genus Streptococcus, but the organism did not correspond to any recognized species of this genus. The nearest phylogenetic relatives of the unknown coccus from a calf were Streptococcus acidominimus and Streptococcus suis. The unknown bacterium, however, was distinguished from these species and other animal streptococci by biochemical tests and electrophoretic analysis of whole-cell proteins. Based on both phenotypic and phylogenetic findings, it is proposed that the unknown bacterium be classified as a novel species of the genus Streptococcus, Streptococcus entericus sp. nov. The type strain is CECT 5353T (= CCUG 44616T).
TI  - Genetic bases and medical relevance of capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis in pathogenic streptococci.
AB  - Many streptococci are human and/or animal pathogens and the frequent cause of life-threatening diseases. Among various streptococcal virulence factors, capsular polysaccharides (CPs) are recognized as essential to prevent phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils. In the last decade, an impressive advance on the knowledge of the genetic bases underlying capsule formation has been achieved. The capsular gene cluster driving the formation of the CP of Streptococcus pyogenes and other hyaluronate-producing streptococci, represents one of the simplest cases of gene organization to synthesize a capsule. A more complex situation has been found in Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus suis, and other streptococci. On the whole, there exists a direct relationship between the structural and chemical complexity of the repeating unit of the polysaccharide and the number of genes found in the corresponding capsular locus. Streptococcal vaccines, either polysaccharide or conjugate, are currently being tested in clinical trials to overcome the rise of worldwide antibiotic resistance, although, for different reasons, none of these vaccines are expected to provide the required full coverage in a near future. This concern has prompted to explore alternative possibilities with an improved therapeutic potential against streptococcal diseases.
TI  - An enzyme-based in situ hybridisation method for the identification of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - A method for enzyme-based in situ hybridisation of Streptococcus suis was developed. It enables the light microscopic localization of bacterial ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. A unique sequence in the 16S rRNA of S. suis was targeted. Different pretreatment protocols were applied to facilitate probe penetration and multiple detection systems were tested. The results were compared to those obtained by immunohistochemistry. Pretreatment was necessary to obtain a signal by in situ hybridisation. The use of proteinase-K pretreatment was optimal regarding sensitivity and preservation of tissue morphology. A strong specific in situ hybridisation signal was achieved in tissue sections containing S. suis in microcolonies and the microanatomy of the surrounding tissue was easily assessed. However, the signal distribution differed from that found immunohistochemically and low-grade infection could not be detected by in situ hybridisation. These findings were interpreted as reflecting the physiological state of the bacteria. Thus, this method could prove useful in future studies of the infection pathogenesis.
TI  - Evidence for lateral transfer of the Suilysin gene region of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Suilysin is a cholesterol-binding cytolysin encoded by sly in Streptococcus suis. DNA sequence determination of the sly locus in a strain lacking sly revealed the presence of another gene, designated orf102, in the place of sly. No transposable element or long-repeat sequence was found in the close vicinity. Except for six strains whose corresponding loci have been rearranged, all of the remaining 62 strains examined had either sly or orf102 at the same locus and their flanking regions were conserved. The genetic organizations having either sly or orf102 were found in the strains whose 16S rRNA sequences were identical. These results suggest that S. suis acquired sly or orf102 from a foreign source and that these genes subsequently spread among S. suis strains by homologous recombination.
TI  - CD14-dependent and -independent cytokine and chemokine production by human THP-1  monocytes stimulated by Streptococcus suis capsular type 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis capsular type 2 is an important aetiologic agent of swine meningitis, and it has been highlighted as a cause of occupational disease leading to meningitis and fulminant sepsis in humans. The objective of the present work was to study the ability of S. suis type 2 to induce the release of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-8 and monocyte chemotactic protein one (MCP-1) by human monocytic THP-1 cells. The induction of these five cytokines was dose- and incubation time-dependent, and it was significantly enhanced by pre-treatment of cells with interferon gamma. IL-8 levels were markedly higher compared with those obtained with the other cytokines. However, elevated levels of MCP-1 and IL-6 were also observed. Levels of cytokine induced by heat-killed or live bacteria were similar. Pre-treatment of cells with anti-CD14 monoclonal antibodies suggested that this important host receptor is partially implicated in TNF, IL-1, IL-6 and MCP-1 production, while CD14-independent pathways seem to be responsible for IL-8 production after S. suis stimulation. In addition, blocking studies with anti-TNF and anti-IL-1 antibodies revealed that these cytokines are involved in amplification of the S. suis-induced cytokine cascade. When several different S. suis strains of human or porcine origin were compared, a very heterogeneous pattern of cytokine production was observed. Human strains did not exhibit a clear tendency to induce higher cytokine release by human THP-1 monocytes. The synergistic effect of the up-regulation of cytokines during S. suis meningitis may mediate many of the inflammatory reactions, including the sequestration of leucocytes at the site of infection.
TI  - [Studies on human streptococcal infectious syndrome caused by infected pigs].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate the clinical manifestations of S. suis infectious syndrome; to study the characteristics of causative organism and its source. METHODS: 25 cases of unknown causes of food poisoning were identified in the central area of Jiangsu province, China in July 1998. Biological specimens was collected in some patients, and the causative organism was isolated using a number of different culture medium. Isolated organisms were identified by serum antibody tests, API biochemical tests, drug sensitivity tests and animal model experiments. The human born strains and the pig born strains were compared by RAPD technique. Epidemiological methods were applied to trace the source of causative organisms. RESULTS: Cases were clinically categorized into two types: Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) and streptococcal meningitis syndrome (SMS). Three strains of streptococci were isolated respectively from the blood and cerebrospinal fluid of 6 cases. All these 6 strains were confirmed to be S. suis type 2 by culture characteristics, morphology, biochemical characteristics, serum antibody tests and fatty acid profile analysis. Animal model experiment showed that these strains were sensitive to rabbits and pigs, but not to rats. RAPD fingerprint test revealed an identity between human born and pig born strains. CONCLUSIONS: The aetiological agent of these human cases was S. suis type 2. Human cases were contracted by direct contact with the infected pigs or the corpse of infected pigs.
TI  - [Homogeneity study on the Streptococcus suis isolated from human and swine].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify S. suis and to evaluate the homogeneity of isolates of S.  suis from human and swine. METHODS: Culture, morphology, API biochemical tests and serum coagulate tests were used. All the 7 strains of streptococcus were confirmed to be S. suis serotype 2. Two strains and 1 strain were isolated from blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients, respectively, while the other 4 strains were obtained from the infected swine or their corpses. Seven strains of S. suis serotype 2 and reference strain SS2 were analyzed by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA analysis with six primers and Rep PCR with four primers and thalli fatty acid profile analysis. Cluster and principal compound analysis of results were performed with RAPD, Phylip and Treeview software. RESULTS: By analysis on RAPD patterns, a close relationship among 7 strains of S. suis serotype 2 and reference strain SS2 was discovered. Human-born strains and swine-born strains exhibit similar RAPD patterns. There was a same clonal relationship between strains originated from the blood and CFS of the patients. These results were confirmed by thalli fatty acid profile to have genotypic and phenotypic identity. CONCLUSION: Homogeneity exists among the 7 strains and reference strain SS2.
TI  - Antibody response to an autogenous vaccine and serologic profile for Streptococcus suis capsular type 1/2.
AB  - An autogenous vaccine was developed, using sonicated bacteria, with a strain of Streptococcus suis capsular type 1/2. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the antibody response following vaccination and to assess the changes in antibody levels in pigs from a herd showing clinical signs of S. suis capsular type 1/2 infection in 6- to 8-week-old pigs. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the vaccine antigen was standardized. Results from a preliminary study involving 2 control and 4 vaccinated 4-week-old pigs indicated that all vaccinated pigs produced antibodies against 2 proteins of 34 and 43 kDa, respectively, and, in 3 out of 4 vaccinated pigs, against the 117-kDa muramidase-released protein. For the serologic profile, groups of 30 pigs from the infected herd were blood sampled at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 weeks of age. The lowest antibody level was observed between weeks 6 and 8, presumably corresponding to a decrease in maternal immunity. A marked increase was seen at 10 weeks of age, shortly after the onset of clinical signs in the herd. For the vaccination field trial, newly weaned, one-week-old piglets were divided into 2 groups of 200 piglets each (control and vaccinated); blood samples were collected from 36 piglets in each group at 2-week intervals for 12 weeks. A significant increase (P < 0.05) in antibody response was observed 4 weeks following vaccination and the level of antibodies stayed high until the end of the experiment. In the control group, the increase was only observed at 13 weeks of age, probably in response to a natural infection. The response to the vaccine varied considerably among pigs and was attributed, in part, to the levels of maternal antibodies at the time of vaccination. No outbreak of S. suis was observed in the control or vaccinated groups, so the protection conferred by the vaccine could not be evaluated.
TI  - Contribution of fibronectin-binding protein to pathogenesis of Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - In the present study we investigated the role of the fibronectin (FN)- and fibrinogen (FGN)-binding protein (FBPS) in the pathogenesis of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 in piglets. The complete gene encoding FBPS from S. suis serotype 2 was cloned in Escherichia coli and sequenced. The occurrence of the gene in various serotypes was analyzed by hybridization studies. The FBPS protein was expressed in E. coli and purified, and binding to human FN and FGN was demonstrated. The induction of antibodies in piglets was studied upon infection. An isogenic mutant unable to produce FBPS was constructed, and the levels of virulence of the wild-type and mutant strains were compared in a competitive infection model in young piglets. Organ cultures showed that FBPS was not required for colonization of the tonsils but that FBPS played a role in the colonization of the specific organs involved in an S. suis infection. Therefore, the FBPS mutant was considered as an attenuated mutant.
TI  - The gram-positive tonsillar and nasal flora of piglets before and after weaning.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate gram-positive nasal and tonsillar microbial flora of piglets before and after weaning. METHODS AND RESULTS: The nasal and tonsillar gram-positive bacterial flora of 20 non-weaned piglets (2 weeks of age) and 20 weaned piglets (6 weeks of age), obtained from four different piggeries, was quantified by culture and identified by tDNA-PCR. The most widely occurring species from nasal conchae before as well as after weaning in the different piglets investigated were Streptococcus suis and Rothia nasimurium. After weaning a wide variety of Lactobacillus species appeared but in low numbers. In the tonsils, Strep. suis, Strep. dysgalactiae, S. hyicus, S. aureus, Arcanobacterium pyogenes and Actinomyces hyovaginalis were the species isolated from the largest number of pigs before and after weaning. S. aureus and most lactobacilli became more prevalent after weaning. Bacteria not known to be associated with pigs found in the present study included R. nasimurium, Strep. gallolyticus, Pediococcus pentosaceus and some Lactobacillus species. CONCLUSIONS: Over 30 different gram-positive bacterial species may occur in nasal conchae and tonsils of unweaned piglets at 2 weeks of age and of 6-week-old weaned piglets. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study demonstrated that weaning is associated with changes in prevalence of only a small minority of the highly diversified bacterial flora of the nares and tonsils of pigs.
TI  - Prevalence and diversity of Arcobacter spp. isolated from the internal organs of  spontaneous porcine abortions in Denmark.
AB  - A study was conducted to determine the prevalence and possible significance of campylobacteria in pig abortions in Denmark. Surface-cauterised liver and kidney samples from 55 aborted pig fetuses submitted to the Danish Veterinary Laboratory were taken and a sensitive isolation procedure used to examine pooled tissue samples for Campylobacter, Arcobacter and Helicobacter spp. Routine microbiological, immunological, and histopathological examinations were also performed to identify concurrent infections or histopathological changes. The abortions tested negative for established abortifacient pathogens (Brucella, Leptospira, PPV, PRRSV), but Arcobacter spp. were recovered from 23/55 abortions. Co-infections with Streptococcus suis, Escherichia coli, and haemolytic streptococci were observed in 7/23 Arcobacter-positive fetuses, and in 4/32 Arcobacter-negative fetuses. Histopathological analyses identified placentitis, pneumonia, hepatitis and encephalitis among the study group. However, no obvious pathologic features were solely associated with Arcobacter-positive cases, nor were Arcobacter-like bacteria observed in tissue samples. Protein profile analyses of the 27 Arcobacter isolates identified 11 as A. cryaerophilus and 10 as A. skirrowii. Six strains could not be classified into any existing species and were phenotypically distinct, thus, potentially representing at least one new species. The identification results showed that multiple taxa could be found in a single fetus, and in distinct aborted fetuses from a single sow. The high prevalence of arcobacters in Danish pig abortions may account for at least some of the >90% of cases in which no established abortifacient agent is detected, but further studies are needed to define the role of each species, especially where co-infections with other bacteria are present.
TI  - Toward a structural understanding of the dehydratase mechanism.
AB  - dTDP-D-glucose 4,6-dehydratase (RmlB) was first identified in the L-rhamnose biosynthetic pathway, where it catalyzes the conversion of dTDP-D-glucose into dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose. The structures of RmlB from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium in complex with substrate deoxythymidine 5'-diphospho-D-glucose (dTDP-D-glucose) and deoxythymidine 5'-diphosphate (dTDP), and RmlB from Streptococcus suis serotype 2 in complex with dTDP-D-glucose, dTDP, and deoxythymidine 5'-diphospho-D-pyrano-xylose (dTDP-xylose) have all been solved at resolutions between 1.8 A and 2.4 A. The structures show that the active sites are highly conserved. Importantly, the structures show that the active site tyrosine functions directly as the active site base, and an aspartic and glutamic acid pairing accomplishes the dehydration step of the enzyme mechanism. We conclude that the substrate is required to move within the active site to complete the catalytic cycle and that this movement is driven by the elimination of water. The results provide insight into members of the SDR superfamily.
TI  - The functions of Ca(2+) in bacteria: a role for EF-hand proteins?
AB  - In bacteria, Ca(2+) is implicated in a wide variety of cellular processes, including the cell cycle and cell division. Dedicated influx and efflux systems tightly control the low cytoplasmic Ca(2+) levels in prokaryotes. Additionally, the growing number of proteins containing various Ca(2+)-binding motifs supports the importance of Ca(2+), which controls various protein functions by affecting protein stability, enzymatic activity or signal transduction. The existence of calmodulin-like proteins (containing EF-hand motifs) in bacteria is a long-standing hypothesis. Analysis of the prokaryotic protein sequences available in the databases has revealed the presence of several calmodulin-like proteins containing two or more authentic EF-hand motifs, suggesting that calmodulin-like proteins could be involved in Ca(2+) regulation in bacteria.
TI  - Genetic diversity of Streptococcus suis strains isolated from pigs and humans as  revealed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
AB  - The genetic diversity of 123 Streptococcus suis strains of capsular types 2, 1/2, 3, 7, and 9, isolated from pigs in France and from humans in different countries, was evaluated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of DNA restricted with SmaI. The method was highly discriminative (D = 0.98), results were reproducible, and the PFGE analysis was easy to interpret. Among all S. suis strains, 74 PFGE patterns were shown. At 60% homology, three groups (A, B, and C) were identified, and at 69% homology, eight subgroups (a to h) were observed. Strains isolated from diseased pigs or from humans were statistically clustered in group B, especially in subgroup d. By contrast, S. suis strains isolated from clinically healthy pigs were preferentially included in subgroup b of group A. Relationships could be established between capsular types 1/2, 3, and 9 and groups A, e, and B, respectively. S. suis strains isolated from humans were homogeneous, and a very high level of association between these strains and four DNA patterns was observed. The PFGE used in this study is a very useful tool for evaluating the genetic diversity of S. suis strains, and it would be used for epidemiological investigations.
TI  - Tiamulin activity against fastidious and nonfastidious veterinary and human bacterial isolates: initial development of in vitro susceptibility test methods.
AB  - Tiamulin is a pleuromutilin derivative used in veterinary practice for the control and specific therapy of infections in swine. This report summarizes studies to establish standardized susceptibility testing methods, interpretive criteria, and reagent details for use in veterinary methods recently developed by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) (standards M31-A and M37-A, NCCLS, Wayne, Pa., 1999). A total of 636 fastidious and nonfastidious animal and human pathogens were processed by using media and procedures described by the NCCLS. Tiamulin disk diffusion tests used a 30-microg disk concentration, and the proposed MIC breakpoints corresponding to levels achievable in animal target tissues (lung) were < or =4 microg/ml for susceptibility and > or =32 microg/ml for resistance. Correlate zone diameters for specific nonfastidious species were as follows: for Pasteurella multocida and staphylococci tested on Mueller-Hinton agar, susceptibility at > or =19 mm and resistance at < or =11 mm, and for Actinobacillus suis, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, and Streptococcus suis tested on enriched chocolate Mueller-Hinton agar, susceptibility at > or =16 mm and resistance at < or =8 mm. When Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae was tested, a susceptibility breakpoint of < or =16 microg/ml (> or =9 mm) was suggested for veterinary fastidious medium broth and enriched chocolate Mueller-Hinton agar. Absolute categorical agreement between NCCLS dilution and disk diffusion test results with these criteria ranged from 90.5 to 96.2%. Tiamulin susceptibility testing methods appear to be accurate in their categorical classification for indicated species, and their availability will allow immediate testing of animal isolates to guide therapy via appropriate levels of dosing and to monitor the development of resistance for agents in this unique class.
TI  - Cloning of the O-acetylserine lyase gene from the ruminal bacterium Selenomonas ruminantium HD4.
AB  - The gene coding for O-acetylserine lyase (OASL) was cloned from a Selenomonas ruminantium HD4 Lambda ZAP II genomic library by degenerative probe hybridization and complementation. Sequence analysis revealed a 933 bp ORF with a G + C content of 53%. The ORF had significant homology with enzymes involved in cysteine biosynthesis. A CuraBLASTN homology search showed that the ORF shared 59% nucleotide identity with the cysK of Bacillus subtilis. The deduced amino acid sequence exhibited high (>70%) similarity with the CysK of B. subtilis and other cysteine synthesis proteins from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae, and Spinacia oleracea. Further analysis predicted that the gene product was a member of the pyridoxal phosphate enzyme family and of cytoplasmic origin. Phylogenetic analysis clustered the S. ruminantium gene product with the OASLa isoform of B. subtilis and the OASLb isoforms of Streptococcus suis, Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter jejuni. The OASL of S. ruminantium HD4 was also able to complement the cysM cysK double mutations in Escherichia coli NK3 and allow for growth on minimal media that contained either sulfate or thiosulfate as the sole source of sulfur. These results suggest that the gene functions as a cysM in S. ruminantium HD4. In conclusion, this research describes the cloning and expression of an O-acetylserine lyase gene from the predominant ruminal anaerobe S. ruminantium HD4. To our knowledge, this is the first report characterizing genes involved in sulfur metabolism from the genus Selenomonas.
TI  - Modification of the peptidoglycan of Escherichia coli in the viable but nonculturable state.
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyse the chemical composition of peptidoglycan and the state of some of the enzymes involved in its metabolism in Escherichia coli KN126 in the viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state which is a survival strategy adopted by bacteria (including those of medical interest) when exposed to environmental stresses. When entering the VBNC state, E. coli cells miniaturised and became coccus-shaped. Analysis of peptidoglycan chemical composition, by separation in HPLC of muropeptides released by muramidase digestion of purified peptidoglycan, indicated a high degree of cross-linking, a threefold increase in unusual DAP-DAP cross-linking, an increase in muropeptides bearing covalently bound lipoprotein, and a shortening of the average length of glycan strands in comparison with dividing cells. Analysis of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), enzymes involved in the terminal stage of peptidoglycan assembly showed the disappearance of high-molecular-weight PBPs 1A, 1B, 2, and 3 in VBNC cells. Finally, VBNC cells displayed an autolytic capability which was far higher than that of exponentially growing cells. It is suggested that part of these alterations of peptidoglycan may be connected with the VBNC state.
TI  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 infection in pigs: new diagnostic and pathogenetic  aspects.
AB  - In a study aimed at improving the diagnosis and elucidating the pathogenesis of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 infection in pigs, a combination of bacterial culture and histopathological and immunohistochemical examination was applied to a range of tissues from 42 naturally infected pigs with typical macroscopical lesions. By culture, 21 pigs (50%) were shown to be systemically infected with S. suis serotype 2; seven (17%) were infected with S. suis serotype 7, two with other bacteria, and 12 yielded no bacterial pathogens. The highest isolation rate for S. suis serotype 2 was obtained from the lateral cerebral ventricles and other regions of the brain, whereas the bacterium was only rarely isolated from the liver or spleen. Immunohistochemically, a diagnosis of S. suis serotype 2 infection was obtained in two of 12 (17%) animals from which no pathogens had been cultured. Moreover, immunohistochemistry differed from culture in revealing a greater number of positive tissue specimens. The microanatomical distribution of bacteria pointed toward the pharyngeal and palatine tonsils as principal portals of entry. Furthermore, S. suis serotype 2 bacteria were frequently identified immunohistochemically in the regional lymph nodes of the upper respiratory tract, possibly reflecting primary lymphogenous spread from the tonsils.
TI  - Characterization of Streptococcus suis genes encoding proteins homologous to sortase of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Many surface proteins which are covalently linked to the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria have a consensus C-terminal motif, Leu-Pro-X-Thr-Gly (LPXTG). This sequence is cleaved, and the processed protein is attached to an amino group of a cross-bridge in the peptidoglycan by a specific enzyme called sortase. Using the type strain of Streptococcus suis, NCTC 10234, we found five genes encoding proteins that were homologous to sortases of other bacteria and determined the nucleotide sequences of the genetic regions. One gene, designated srtA, was linked to gyrA, as were the sortase and sortase-like genes of other streptococci. Three genes, designated srtB, srtC, and srtD, were tandemly clustered in a different location, where there were three segments of directly repeated sequences of approximately 110 bp in close vicinity. The remaining gene, designated srtE, was located separately on the chromosome with a pseudogene which may encode a transposase. The deduced amino acid sequences of the five Srt proteins showed 18 to 31% identity with the sortases of Streptococcus gordonii and Staphylococcus aureus, except that SrtA of S. suis had 65% identity with that of S. gordonii. Isogenic mutants deficient for srtA, srtBCD, or srtE were generated by allelic exchanges. The protein fraction which was released from partially purified cell walls by digestion with N-acetylmuramidase was profiled by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. More than 15 of the protein spots were missing in the profile of the srtA mutant compared with that of the parent strain, and this phenotype was completely complemented by srtA cloned from S. suis. Four genes encoding proteins corresponding to such spots were identified and sequenced. The deduced translational products of the four genes possessed the LPXTG motif in their C-terminal regions. On the other hand, the protein spots that were missing in the srtA mutant appeared in the profiles of the srtBCD and srtE mutants. These results provide evidence that the cell wall sorting system involving srtA is also present in S. suis.
TI  - Streptococcus suis infection in northern Thailand.
AB  - A ten-case report of Streptococcus suis infection was reported in Lamphun, northern Thailand from 1999 to 2000. Ten patients were admitted to Lampoon Provincial Hospital with a history of high fever, watery diarrhea, severe myalgia and ecchymosis rashes. The disease progressed rapidly and all patients died within 24-48 hours after admission from complications such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), acute renal failure (ARF) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Epidemiological data revealed that all cases were healthy men aged between 40-49, residing in the same geographical area and had a history of raw pork or uncooked pig's blood consumption prior to their illnesses. Blood culture and genetic investigation (16 s rRNA polymerase chain reaction with restriction enzyme PstII) confirmed diagnoses of the same species of Streptococcus suis infections.
TI  - Development of a Brucella suis specific hybridisation probe and PCR which distinguishes B. suis from Brucella abortus.
AB  - A genomic library was prepared from Brucella suis DNA (MboI digested) and cloned  into the BamHI site of pUC18. Colony hybridisation using a probe prepared from purified B. suis DNA labelled with alpha 32P was carried out to identify colonies of interest. About 20 colonies, which gave an intense signal upon hybridisation with whole B. suis genomic DNA as a probe, were selected. Because of the high degree of DNA homology between B. suis and Brucella abortus, a short probe was chosen as it would more likely give species specificity. Of seven fragments selected to probe whole B. suis, B. abortus, and Yersinia enterocolitica DNA, one was found to hybridise with B. suis only. The probe was sequenced in two directions and sense and anti sense primers of 25bp in length were chosen to yield a product of 421bp. After optimisation of the PCR, a product of 420bp was obtained with B. suis template DNA and two bands of 420 and 650bp were detected with B. abortus template DNA. This is the first reported PCR of the Brucella genome where a single pair of primers will discriminate between B. suis and B. abortus. No band was observed when the two primers were used to amplify E. coli, Y. enterocolitica, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, Corynebacterium bovis, or Serratia marcescens template DNA.
TI  - Assessment of protective efficacy of live and killed vaccines based on a non-encapsulated mutant of Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - The protective efficacy of a live and killed non-encapsulated isogenic mutant of  Streptococcus suis serotype 2 was determined in pigs, and compared with the efficacy of the capsulated wild-type strain. SPF pigs were vaccinated twice intramuscularly at 4 and 7 weeks of age with a dose of 1 x 10(9) formalin-killed CFU of the wild-type (WT-BAC), formalin-killed non-encapsulated mutant (CM-BAC) or live non-encapsulated mutant (CM-LIVE) strain. After 2 weeks, vaccinated pigs and non-vaccinated controls were challenged intravenously with 1 x 10(7) CFU of the homologous, wild-type S. suis serotype 2 strain. Protection was evaluated by clinical, bacteriological, serological and post-mortem examinations. All pigs vaccinated with WT-BAC were completely protected against challenge with the homologous serotype. Pigs vaccinated with CM-BAC were partially protected. Although all pigs vaccinated with CM-BAC survived the challenge, four out of five pigs developed clinical signs of disease for several days. Compared to the WT-BAC and CM-BAC, the CM-LIVE vaccine was less protective. Two out of five pigs vaccinated with CM-LIVE died in the course of the experiment and all of them developed specific clinical signs of disease for several days. The protective efficacy of the vaccines could be associated with serum antibody titers. Antibody titers against cells of wild-type and non-encapsulated mutant strains as well as against muramidase-released proteins (MRP) were high in pigs vaccinated with WT-BAC and CM-BAC. Pigs vaccinated with CM-LIVE showed lower antibody titers. Antibody titers against purified capsular polysaccharides (CPS) of S. suis serotype 2 were only found in pigs vaccinated with WT-BAC. These findings indicate that CPS and other bacterial components of WT-BAC are probably essential for full protection against homologous challenge.
TI  - The role of pulmonary intravascular macrophages in porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus infection.
AB  - The objective of this article is to summarize the current state of knowledge of the complex interaction of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and porcine pulmonary intravascular macrophages (PIMs). PIMs play an important role in pulmonary surveillance, and in the past few years we have investigated their role in PRRSV infection. PRRSV antigens and nucleic acids have been demonstrated in PIMs both in vitro and in vivo. Examination of cultured PIMs infected with PRRSV revealed the accumulation of viral particles in the smooth-walled vesicles. PRRSV-infected PIMs in vitro yielded a virus titer similar to pulmonary alveolar macrophages. PRRSV infection induces either apoptosis or cell lysis of PIMs. The in vitro bactericidal activity of PRRSV-infected PIMs is significantly decreased. Phagocytic activity of PIMs, as measured by pulmonary copper clearance, is significantly decreased in PRRSV-infected pigs. This evidence supports the hypothesis that PRRSV-induced damage to PIMs results in increased susceptibility to bacteremic diseases. Recent studies with PRRSV and Streptococcus suis coinfection confirmed that PRRSV predisposes pigs to S. suis infection and bacteremia. These results could explain the increase in bacterial respiratory diseases and septicemias observed in PRRSV-infected pigs.
TI  - Distribution and genetic diversity of suilysin in Streptococcus suis isolated from different diseases of pigs and characterization of the genetic basis of suilysin absence.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an economically important pathogen of pigs responsible for  a variety of diseases including meningitis, septicemia, arthritis, and pneumonia, although little is known about the mechanisms of pathogenesis or virulence factors associated with this organism. Here, we report on the distribution and genetic diversity of the putative virulence factor suilysin, a member of the thiol-activated toxin family of gram-positive bacteria. On the basis of PCR analysis of over 300 isolates of S. suis, the suilysin-encoding gene, sly, was detected in 69.4% of isolates. However, sly was present in a considerably higher proportion of isolates obtained from cases of meningitis, septicemia, and arthritis (>80%) and isolates obtained from asymptomatic tonsillar carriage (>90%) than lung isolates associated with pneumonia (44%). With the exception of serotypes 1, 14, and 1/14, there was no strong correlation between the presence of suilysin and serotype. Analysis of the genetic diversity of suilysin by restriction fragment length polymorphism and sequence analysis found that the suilysin gene, where present, is highly conserved with a maximum of 1.79% diversity at the nucleotide level seen between sly alleles. Assays of hemolytic activity and hybridization analysis provided no evidence for a second member of the thiol-activated toxin family in S. suis. Inverse PCR was used to characterize regions flanking sly, which in turn allowed the first characterization of the equivalent region in a strain lacking sly. Sequence comparison of these regions from sly-positive (P1/7) and sly-negative (DH5) strains indicated that two alternative arrangements are both flanked by genes with highest similarity to haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolases (5' end) and putative N-acetylmannosamine-6-phosphate epimerases (3' end). However, sly appears to be completely absent from the alternative arrangement, and a gene of unknown function is located in the equivalent position. Finally, PCR analysis of multiple sly-positive and -negative strains indicated that these two alternative genetic arrangements are conserved among many S. suis isolates.
TI  - Thermosensitive suicide vectors for gene replacement in Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Three thermosensitive (Ts) suicide vectors, pSET4s, pSET5s, and pSET6s, have been constructed for gene replacement in Streptococcus suis. Each vector contains an antibiotic-resistance gene (spc or cat), a Ts replication origin of pWV01 lineage, multiple cloning sites, lacZ', and the ColE1 replication origin of pUC19. These vectors could be propagated at 37 degrees C in Escherichia coli, but their replication was blocked above 37 degrees C in S. suis. Moreover, the thermosensitivity of the replication origin was confirmed in S. equi ssp. equi, S. equi ssp. zooepidemicus, and S. dysgalactiae by using pSET4s. For inactivation of the sly gene, which encodes a thiol-activated hemolysin of S. suis, pSLYK, in which the sly gene was interrupted by the cat gene, was constructed using pSET4s and introduced into S. suis DAT2. After growth at the nonpermissive temperature under the antibiotic pressure, the chromosomal sly gene was replaced with the sly::cat gene of pSLYK by a double-crossover event at a rate of 2.6% among chloramphenicol-resistant cells. Moreover, complementation of the sly gene by use of the previously reported S. suis-E. coli shuttle vector pSET2 was demonstrated. These results indicate that the Ts suicide vectors described here will facilitate the genetic analysis of S. suis and other streptococci of veterinary importance by means of allelic exchange of the genes of interest via homologous recombination.
TI  - Prevalence and mechanism of resistance against macrolides and lincosamides in Streptococcus suis isolates.
AB  - Eighty-seven Streptococcus suis isolates recovered in 1999-2000 from diseased pigs, all from different farms, were screened for resistance against macrolide and lincosamide antibiotics by the disk diffusion and agar dilution test and a PCR assay, amplifying the ermB gene and the mefA/E gene. Seventy-one percent of the isolates showed constitutive resistance to macrolide and lincosamide antibiotics (MLS(B)-phenotype). All these isolates were positive for the ermB gene in the PCR, but negative for the mefA/E gene. For all strains minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against five other antimicrobial agents were determined. All strains were susceptible to penicillin. Ninety-nine percent of the isolates were susceptible to enrofloxacin and tiamulin. Eighty-five percent of the strains were resistant to doxycycline. A 540bp fragment of the ermB genes of eight S. suis strains was sequenced and compared with ermB genes of five S. pneumoniae and five S. pyogenes strains of human origin. A 100% homology was found between these fragments in seven S. suis, one S. pneumoniae and three of the S. pyogenes isolates. This study demonstrates that resistance against macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin B is widespread in S. suis and mediated by ribosome methylation, encoded by the ermB gene.
TI  - Streptococcus suis serotypes characterized by analysis of chaperonin 60 gene sequences.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important pathogen of swine which occasionally infects humans as well. There are 35 serotypes known for this organism, and it would be desirable to develop rapid methods methods to identify and differentiate the strains of this species. To that effect, partial chaperonin 60 gene sequences were determined for the 35 serotype reference strains of S. suis. Analysis of a pairwise distance matrix showed that the distances ranged from 0 to 0.275 when values were calculated by the maximum-likelihood method. For five of the strains the distances from serotype 1 were greater than 0.1, and for two of these strains the distances were were more than 0.25, suggesting that they belong to a different species. Most of the nucleotide differences were silent; alignment of protein sequences showed that there were only 11 distinct sequences for the 35 strains under study. The chaperonin 60 gene phylogenetic tree was similar to the previously published tree based on 16S rRNA sequences, and it was also observed that strains with identical chaperonin 60 gene sequences tended to have identical 16S rRNA sequences. The chaperonin 60 gene sequences provided a higher level of discrimination between serotypes than the 16S RNA sequences provided and could form the basis for a diagnostic protocol.
TI  - Bacteriological diagnosis of Streptococcus suis meningitis.
AB  
TI  - Distribution of the SsuDAT1I restriction-modification system among different serotypes of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - The SsuDAT1I restriction-modification (R-M) system, which contains two methyltransferases and two restriction endonucleases with recognition sequence 5'-GATC-3', was first found in a field isolate of Streptococcus suis serotype 2. Isoschizomers of the R-M system were found in the same locus between purH and purD in a field isolate of serotype 1/2 and the reference strains of serotypes 3, 7, 23, and 26 among 29 strains of different serotypes examined in this study. The R-M gene sequences in serotypes 1/2, 3, 7, and 23 were very similar to those of SsuDAT1I, whereas those in serotype 26 were less similar. These results indicate intraspecies recombination among them and genetic divergence through their evolution.
TI  - Aerogenous infection of microbiologically defined minipigs with Streptococcus suis serotype 2. A new model.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is the cause of serious infections in animals and humans, but certain aspects of the infection pathogenesis still remain unclear. In this study an experimental model of aerogenous infection and induction of septicemia with S. suis serotype 2 was established in microbiologically defined Gottingen minipigs. Ten animals were exposed to aerosolized S. suis after previous exposure to mild acetic acid in aerosol. Six of the animals were immunosuppressed with prednisolone acetate on different days. All the animals were monitored clinically until euthanasia on days 6 to 13 after exposure. Necropsy was performed and samples were taken for microbiology, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry Three out of four animals immunosuppressed on days 5 to 7 after exposure developed S. suis septicemia, and S. suis could be detected in the tonsil of the soft palate and/or the nasal cavity of all exposed animals. Thus, using the presented model, local as well as systemic infection with S. suis serotype 2 was established in the Gottingen minipig. Since this breed is defined as free of S. suis and a range of other endemic porcine pathogens, the experimental model could prove useful in the study of this infection.
TI  - [Streptococcus suis meningitis].
AB  - Human infection by Streptococcus suis (S. suis) is a zoonosis, with a known occupational risk and clinical presentation mainly as a purulent meningitis with low mortality and frequent hearing loss and ataxia sequela. Less than 150 human cases have been reported since original one thirty years ago. There is a geographical distribution most patients living in northern Europe and south Asia. S. suis disease in human has been reported in two patients in Spain the last years. We present two patients with S. suis meningitis, both were men with occupation related by pork meet, and good outcome. They come at our hospital in a lapse of one month. Both had neurosensorial hearing loss and walking ataxia. One patient had peripheral facial paralysis and diplopia because of paresia of contralateral sixth nerve, with complete resolution at three months. The rare presentation of S. suis meningitis in our country must not forget us to record the working risk at anamnesis.
TI  - Experimental infection of conventional pigs with Streptococcus suis serotype 2 by aerosolic exposure.
AB  
TI  - Endocarditis and meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis after cardiac surgery in a sheep.
AB  - A female Dorset-cross sheep developed labored respirations and was anorexic, weak, ataxic and febrile (42.0 degrees C) 15 days after implantation of a cardiac device. Clinical pathologic evaluation identified a mild leukocytosis (11,800 cells/microl), neutrophilia (8,969 cells/microl), and hypokalemia (2.9 mmol/L). Despite intensive therapy, the animal was euthanized 7 days later. Necropsy of the sheep revealed meningitis and vegetative endocarditis associated with the cardiac device. Blood cultures collected antemortem and tissue cultures collected at necropsy yielded Streptococcus suis. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of bacterial valvular endocarditis and meningoencephalitis. A variety of environmental and host factors are proposed as contributing to the infection, and the zoonotic potential of S. suis is discussed.
TI  - Experimental infection of specific pathogen free piglets with French strains of Streptococcus suis capsular type 2.
AB  - A standardized model of Streptococcus suis type 2 infection in specific-pathogen-free piglets, housed in high-security barns, was used to compare the virulence of 3 French field strains of S. suis serotype 2 isolated from tonsils of a healthy pig (strain 65) or from diseased pigs (meningitis, strain 166', or septicemia, strain 24). In one of the 2 trials, 7-week-old pigs, in 3 groups of 8, were inoculated intravenously with 2 x 10(8) colony-forming units of S. suis type 2. In each group, 1 uninfected animal was a sentinel. Eight animals were also used as negative control group. The experiment was repeated under similar conditions with strains 65 and 166'. Virulence differed markedly among these S. suis strains when clinical signs, zootechnical performances, lesions, and bacteriological data were analyzed. Strain 65 did not induce clinical signs in inoculated pigs. In contrast, pigs infected with the other 2 strains exhibited clinical signs and typical lesions of S. suis type 2 infections. Differences in virulence were also observed between the 2 virulent strains. Sentinel animals exhibited the same manifestations as those recorded in inoculated piglets. Results were similar in the second trial, indicating that under the present experimental conditions, results were reproducible. The standardized conditions described in this study could be a useful tool to further study about the S. suis infection.
TI  - Experimental colonization of piglets and gilts with systemic strains of Haemophilus parasuis and Streptococcus suis to prevent disease.
AB  - Haemophilus parasuis and Streptococcus suis are both major causes of losses during the nursery period, especially in herds using the segregated early weaning system. In this system, only a few piglets may be colonized with the herd's prevalent systemic strain, which results in infection of naive penmates late in the nursery. In view of these factors, the objectives of this study were: (1) to evaluate the early colonization of piglets with the farm's prevalent systemic strain of H. parasuis and S. suis as an alternative method for disease prevention; and (2) to evaluate 2 different protocols for experimental colonization: direct colonization of piglets and colonization of piglets through nose-to-nose contact with inoculated sows. Haemophilus parasuis and S. suis isolates recovered from diseased nursery pigs were characterized by the rep-PCR technique and the herd's prevalent strains were used for colonization. Piglets in the experimentally colonized groups were inoculated at 5 days of age by the oral route using a spray pump. Sows were colonized at 2 weeks prior to farrowing using a similar protocol. Although both colonization protocols were successful in getting the piglets colonized, direct inoculation of 5-day-old piglets with the herd's systemic strains of H. parasuis and S. suis tended to be more effective in reducing the morbidity and the mortality than the colonization of piglets by nose-to-nose contact with inoculated sows.
TI  - Decrease of the adhesion of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 mutants to embryonic bovine tracheal cells and porcine tracheal rings.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important swine pathogen that may be present in the tonsils of pigs that show no signs of illness. Because adhesion to host cells may be important in the carrier state, this study was undertaken to investigate adhesion to host cells by S. suis mutant strains defective in expression of a 39-kDa protein. Mutant strains of S. suis were generated by transposon Tn916 mutagenesis and were tested for adhesion to embryonic bovine tracheal cells and porcine tracheal rings. Compared with the parent strain, there was a significant reduction in adherence of 3 mutant strains to both bovine tracheal cells and porcine tracheal rings.
TI  - Prevalence, capsular type and antimicrobial susceptibility of Streptococcus suis  isolated from slaughter pigs in Korea.
AB  - This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence, capsular serotype, and antimicrobial susceptibility of Streptococcus suis isolated from slaughter pigs. Capsular serotype and antimicrobial susceptibility were determined by coagglutination test and agar dilution minimum inhibitory concentration, respectively. Streptococcus suis was isolated from 55 of the 406 palatine tonsillar samples tested (13.8%) and 14 of the 29 sampled herds (48.3%). Of the 55 isolates recovered from slaughter pigs, 26 (47.3%) were untypeable. Of the remaining 29 isolates, capsular serotypes 9 (9 isolates) and 16 (4 isolates) were the most common, followed by capsular serotypes 4 (3 isolates) and 7 (3 isolates). Every capsulated isolate was typeable and no palatine tonsillar sample yielded more than one serotype. Most of isolates were susceptible to low concentrations (MIC90) of amoxicillin (2 microg/mL), ceftiofur (1 microg/mL), and penicillin (1 microg/mL). No correlation was found between antimicrobial susceptibility and capsular serotype.
TI  - [Pneumonia in calves: characterization of the bacterial spectrum and the resistance patterns to antimicrobial drugs].
AB  - The population under study included young calves with pneumonia (group A, n = 13) and their controls (group B, n = 9), as well as older calves from which the lungs with (group C, n = 90) or without (group D, n = 10) lesions were collected after slaughter. Arcanobacterium pyogenes was the organism most commonly isolated from calves in group A (46%), followed by Haemophilus somnus (23%), Mannheimia haemolytica (15%), Streptococcus suis and Pasteurella multocida (7.7% each). Only S. suis (22%) and P. multocida (11%) were found in group B. P. multocida was isolated from 32% group C calves, H. somnus from 11%, A. pyogenes from 7.8%, M. haemolytica from 2.2% and S. suis from 1.1%. No specific pathogens were isolated in group D. Prevalence of Mycoplasma bovis infection was 69% in group A and 37% in group C. Ninety-eight strains were tested for resistAnce to antibiotics. Resistance to penicillin and ampicillin was present only in M. haemolytica (46%). High percentages of resistant strains were observed for streptomycin (48-100%), tetracycline (15-43%), sulfonamides alone (14-100%) or in combination with trimethoprim (0-100%). Therapeutic approaches to bacterial calf pneumonia in the area under study should be modified according to the isolated bacterial population, the observed antimicrobial resistances and the growing importance of Mycoplasma bovis.
TI  - Epidemiological relationship of human and swine Streptococcus suis isolates.
AB  - Two cases of meningitis due to Streptococcus suis in humans are reported here. A  butcher and an abattoir worker were referred to a health centre in Castellon (Spain) with fever and symptoms of meningitis. After adequate treatment, a slight hipoacusia persisted as sequelae in both cases. Colonies of S. suis group R, serotype 2 and phenotype MRP+EF+ were isolated from cerebroespinal fluid. Epidemiological studies showed that both workers had in common the handling of pork meat of slaughtered healthy pigs from three closed farms. A study of the tonsils from apparently healthy, slaughtered pigs was carried out. A total of 234 tonsillar samples were obtained and 81 strains of S. suis were isolated from them. Serotype 2 appeared to be the most frequent (50.6%), and the analysis for phenotype showed a high percentage of tonsillar strains with the phenotype MRP+EF+ (35.9%). The humans and 28 tonsillar swine strains showed a similar profile (S. suis group R, serotype 2 and phenotype MRP+EF+). A total of 26 of the swine isolates were analysed by ribotyping using EcoRI. The human strains showed the same six-band hybridization pattern that shared five bands with the pattern most frequently shown by most of the tonsillar N. suis group R, serotype 2 and phenotype MRP+EF+ strains, differing only in the lightest, faintest band which was slightly less anodical in human (> or = 1.8 kb) than in swine (approximately 1.8 kb). From these results, both groups of strains, humans and porcine, showed differences; how can these differences in the pattern of ribotyping be explained if they should have the same origin? Is it possible that they have undergone an adaptation to the new host or perhaps the modification is due to other unknown causes? Further studies in this area are required in order to answer these questions.
TI  - Experimental airborne transmission of Streptococcus suis capsular type 2 in pigs.
AB  - Experimental airborne transmission of Streptococcus suis type 2 was studied in specific pathogen free piglets. Forty piglets were allotted to five groups of eight 7-week-old animals and housed in three separated units. Negative control pigs (group 1) were housed in unit A and infected batches were housed in units B (group 2) and C (groups 4). In units B and C, non-inoculated groups (groups 3 and 5, respectively), 40 cm distant from the respective inoculated group and without any physical contact between them, also took place. Six animals of groups 2 and 4 were inoculated intravenously with 2 x 10(8) colony forming units (cfu) of a mild and a high virulent S. suis strains, respectively. The remaining animals in these groups and pigs from groups 1, 3, 5 received broth medium in the same way. Differences among virulence of S. suis capsular type 2 were observed in inoculated pigs of groups 2 and 4. Pigs from group 2 became carriers, showing only mild symptoms. By contrast, animals from group 4 presented an acute form of the disease. All the indirect contact pigs in groups 3 and 5 had S. suis in palatine tonsils from day 6 after the infection and they presented clinical manifestations similar to those observed in experimentally infected pigs. Two direct contact animals were also contaminated in the upper respiratory tract but surprisingly they did not show any symptoms. Airborne transmission of S. suis in experimentally pigs was demonstrated in the present study. Indirect infections, as described in this study, are a more realistic way to infect pigs than other experimental procedures and may be used to further study the pathogenesis of the infection caused by this important pathogen.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a Streptococcus thermophilus plasmid closely related to the pMV158 family.
AB  - Twenty-two Streptococcus thermophilus strains used for milk fermentations were analyzed for their plasmid content and 13 of them (59%) were found to contain one or two plasmids. Fifteen S. thermophilus plasmids were divided into four groups using DNA homology. Ten plasmids were classified within group A and they shared homologies with all the previously sequenced S. thermophilus plasmids. Three plasmids (group B) hybridized with each other and two plasmids only hybridized with themselves (groups C and D). Single-stranded DNA was detected within strains containing plasmids of groups A, C, and D, indicating that they replicate via a rolling-circle mode. The only plasmid of group C, named pSMQ172, was further characterized. This 4230-bp plasmid replicates in Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, and Streptococcus salivarius and does not confer phage resistance. Comparisons with databases showed that pSMQ172 was related to pMV158 of Streptococcus agalactiae and to pSSU1 of Streptococcus suis. These results suggest that genetic exchanges may have occurred between pathogenic and nonpathogenic streptococci.
TI  - Iron content of Streptococcus suis and evidence for a dpr homologue.
AB  - The type strain of Streptococcus suis was investigated for features that might help the organism to tolerate the H2O2 that is produced during growth. Enzyme assays, using soluble extracts, revealed that the type strain, which lacks catalase, lacks NADH peroxidase in both the mid-exponential and stationary phases of the growth cycle. Although iron could not be detected colourimetrically in dense cell suspensions, determination of the cellular iron content following growth to early stationary phase in the presence of 55FeCl3 demonstrated that S. suis does contain iron and hence is incapable of iron exclusion. Gene amplification, using oligonucleotide primers based on dpr of Streptococcus mutans, followed by nucleotide sequencing, revealed in S. suis, the presence of a gene that encodes a Dpr homologue. It is concluded that in S. suis, tolerance of H2O2 is due to iron sequestration by Dpr and the consequent effect of this process on the extent of Fenton chemistry.
TI  - Passive immunization of pigs against experimental infection with Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - The safety and protective efficacy of a horse antiserum raised against inactivated whole cell preparations of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 was investigated in pigs by experimental challenge. The antiserum was evaluated in two similar experiments each comprising 12 4-week-old pigs treated with 6 ml of antiserum the day before challenge and four pigs used as challenge controls. Pigs were infected by subcutaneous injection with approximately 10(11) colony forming units of S. suis serotype 2. Clinical disease in the pigs that could be attributed to infection with S. suis was reduced from 88 to 35% (P = 0.015). The percentage of pigs with lesions that could be associated with S. suis was reduced from 88 to 22% (P = 0.002) and isolation of S. suis serotype 2 was reduced from five (63%) out of eight pigs in the combined challenge control groups to 3 (13%) out of 23 pigs in the combined treatment groups. These results indicate that passive immunization of pigs may be a way to reduce or control S. suis serotype 2 infections in pigs.
TI  - A case-control study of respiratory disease in Thoroughbred racehorses in Sydney, Australia.
AB  - In order to investigate the role of infectious agents in the aetiology of lower respiratory tract disease in Thoroughbred racehorses, a matched case-control study was conducted. Cases were identified by the presence of coughing, and were compared to a control population matched on time of sample collection and location within the same training establishment. Tracheal wash samples were collected from 100 cases and 148 controls. Case horses were more likely than controls to have endoscopic and cytological evidence of airway inflammation. There was no significant association between serological evidence of infection by commonly implicated respiratory viruses and coughing. Similarly, mycoplasma were rarely isolated and were not associated with disease. In contrast, there was a strong association between isolation of greater than a total of 10(3) colony-forming units/ml of tracheal wash and coughing. Individual bacterial species associated with disease included Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus suis, Streptococcus sanguis, Pasteurella spp and Bordetella bronchiseptica. This study provides evidence of the role of bacterial infection in the aetiology of lower respiratory tract inflammation in racehorses. However, in 58% of cases, few or no bacteria were isolated. Hence, at the time of identification of disease, there was no evidence of viral, bacterial or mycoplasmal infection in the majority of coughing horses. The aetiology of the signs observed in these horses requires further investigation.
TI  - Protection of pigs against challenge with virulent Streptococcus suis serotype 2  strains by a muramidase-released protein and extracellular factor vaccine.
AB  - The efficacy of a muramidase-released protein (MRP) and extracellular factor (EF) vaccine in preventing infection and disease in pigs challenged either with a homologous or a heterologous Streptococcus suis serotype 2 strain (MRP+EF+) was compared with the efficacy of a vaccine containing formalin-killed bacterin of S. suis serotype 2 (MRP+EF+). The enhancement of the immune response by different adjuvants (a water-in-oil emulsion [WO] and an aluminium hydroxide-based adjuvant [AH]) and their side effects were also studied. The MRP and EF were purified by affinity chromatography. Pigs were vaccinated twice at three weeks and six weeks of age and challenged intravenously with virulent S. suis serotype 2 strains (MRP+EF+) at eight weeks of age. At challenge, the pigs vaccinated with MRP+EF/WO had high anti-MRP and anti-EF titres and were protected as effectively as pigs vaccinated with WO-formulated vaccines with bacterin. Eight of the nine pigs survived the challenge and almost no clinical signs of disease were observed. The titres obtained with the MRP+EF/AH vaccine were low and only two of the five pigs were protected. Pigs vaccinated with either MRP or EF were less well protected; three of the four pigs died after challenge but the clinical signs of disease were significantly less severe than those observed in the placebo-vaccinated pigs. The protective capacity of the bacterin/AH vaccine was very low, and the mortality among these pigs was as high as in the placebo-vaccinated pigs (80 per cent). Postmortem histological examination revealed meningitis, polyserositis and arthritis in the clinically affected pigs. The results demonstrate that a subunit vaccine containing both MRP and EF, formulated with the WO adjuvant, protected pigs against challenge with virulent S. suis type 2 strains.

TI  - Construction and characterization of Streptococcus suis-Escherichia coli shuttle  cloning vectors.
AB  - pSSU1, a native plasmid of Streptococcus suis DAT1, was used to construct pSET-series shuttle vectors. In addition to the replication function of pSSU1, these vectors contain the multiple cloning sites and lacZ' gene from pUC19, which means that X-gal screening can be used to select recombinants in Escherichia coli. pSET1, pSET2, and pSET3 carry cat, spc, and both of these genes, respectively, as selectable markers. These vectors could be introduced into S. suis, E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium, S. pneumoniae, and S. equi ssp. equi by electrotransformation. The recA gene was cloned from S. suis and sequenced, and this information was used in the construction of a recA mutant of S. suis. Transformation frequencies and/or plasmid stability of all pSET vectors tested were decreased in both S. suis and E. coli recA mutants compared with the parental strains. These results suggested that functional RecA protein improved the maintenance of pSET vectors in both S. suis and E. coli. Moreover, cloning of the functional S. suis recA gene into pSET2 and complementation analysis of the recA mutant were successful in S. suis but not in E. coli. These results showed that pSET vectors are useful tools for cloning and analyzing S. suis genes in S. suis strains directly.
TI  - In utero infection by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus is sufficient to increase susceptibility of piglets to challenge by Streptococcus suis type II.
AB  - Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) consistently elevates the frequency of disease and mortality in young pigs. Many different secondary bacterial diseases occur in PRRS virus (PRRSV)-infected pigs. However, to date, establishing a reproducible experimental model of PRRSV infection in weaned pigs, with subsequent clinical disease following secondary bacterial challenge, has been difficult. PRRSV is frequently isolated during outbreaks from weak-born piglets affected by secondary bacterial diseases. This study was performed to investigate the potential role of intrauterine PRRSV infection on piglet susceptibility to secondary bacterial infection. PRRSV-free pregnant sows were intranasally infected at 98 days of gestation with PRRSV strain SD 23983. All piglets born to the PRRSV-infected sows were viremic. Piglets were removed from the sows at birth and deprived of colostrum. Piglets from PRRSV-infected and noninfected sows were randomly assigned to Streptococcus suis challenge or control subgroups. At 5 days of age, piglets were challenged intranasally with strain MN 87555 of S. suis type II. Total and differential leukocyte counts were performed on blood samples collected at 3 days of age. The numbers of leukocytes, lymphocytes, and monocytes were significantly reduced in the PRRSV-infected piglets. Lesions were observed in bone marrow, brain, lung, heart, spleen, lymph node, tonsil, and thymus of PRRSV-infected piglets. Thymus/body weight ratios of in utero PRRSV-infected piglets were significantly reduced compared to those of non-PRRSV-infected piglets, and thymic lesions were characterized by severe cortical depletion of thymocytes. Lesions were not observed in piglets born to PRRSV-free sows. Overall, 20 out of 22 piglets in the PRRSV-S. suis dual-infection group died within 1 week after challenge with S. suis (10 of 11 in each of two trials). This contrasts with 1 of 18 piglets in the PRRSV-infection-only group and 5 of 23 piglets in the S. suis-challenge-only group (1 of 12 in trial 1 and 4 of 11 in trial 2). No piglets died in the uninfected control groups. Most of the piglets in the PRRSV-S. suis dual-infection group developed suppurative meningitis. S. suis type II was recovered from their brains and joints. These results indicate that in utero infection by PRRSV makes piglets more susceptible to infection and disease following challenge by S. suis type II. In utero infection by PRRSV may provide a useful model to study the interaction between PRRSV and bacterial coinfections in piglets.

TI  - Otitis interna is a frequent sequela to Streptococcus suis meningitis in pigs.
AB  - Twenty-eight histologically confirmed cases of porcine leptomeningitis were examined retrospectively, with focus on the pathology of the inner and middle ear, brain, and vestibulocochlear nerve. Tissues were evaluated by histology and immunohistochemistry for Streptococcus suis serotype 2 antigen, and the bacteriologic results were recorded. Exudative otitis interna was diagnosed in 20/28 pigs (71%). The lesions primarily affected the perilymphatic ducts, with consistent involvement of the scala tympani. Perineuritis of the vestibulocochlear nerve was seen in all but four of the ears affected with otitis interna. Immunohistochemically, S. suis serotype 2 antigen was demonstrated in the leptomeningeal, perineural, and labyrinthine exudates in 11 cases. Otitis media was diagnosed in 10/28 pigs (34%), but evidence of extension to the inner ear was not observed. The findings were highly similar to descriptions of meningogenic labyrinthitis in humans and in laboratory animal models. Otitis interna in pigs can also develop via the meningogenic route and is not always, as generally stated, tympanogenic.

Unlike the parental strain, it is nonhemolytic, noncytotoxic for cultured macrophage-like cells, avirulent in a mouse infection model, yet only slightly attenuated in a porcine model of systemic infection.
TI  - Lactic acid bacterial diversity in the traditional mexican fermented dough pozol  as determined by 16S rDNA sequence analysis.
AB  - The lactic acid bacteria diversity of pozol, a Mexican fermented maize dough, was studied using a total DNA extraction and purification procedure and PCR amplification of 16S rDNA for gram-positive and related bacterial groups. Thirty-six clones were obtained and sequenced to 650 nucleotides. These partial sequences were identified by submission to the non-redundant nucleotide database of NCBI. The identified sequences were aligned with reference sequences of the closest related organisms. This analysis indicated that only 14 sequences were unique clones and these were identified as Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus suis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lact. casei, Lact. alimentarium, and Lact. delbruekii and Clostridium sp. Two non-ribosomal sequences were also detected. Unlike other environments analyzed with this molecular approach where many unidentified microorganisms are found, the identity of most sequences could be established as lactic acid bacteria, indicating that this is the main group among the gram-positive bacteria in pozol. Use of this molecular method permitted detection of lactic acid bacteria different from those previously isolated and identified by culture techniques
TI  - The filamentous bacterial morphotype 'Nostocoida limicola' I contains at least two previously described genera in the low G+C gram positive bacteria.
AB  - Isolates of eight bacterial filaments fitting the published morphological description of 'Nostocoida limicola' I were obtained from the mixed liquor of four different Australian and one Czech Republic activated sludge plants by micromanipulation. On the basis of their near complete (Ben 200 and Ben 201), or partial (Ben 77, Ben 78, Ben 202, Ben 203, Ben 204 and Ben 205) 16S rRNA gene sequences, six of these isolates were 99.3-100% similar to Lactosphaera pasteurii and Trichococcus flocculiformis, a bulking filament only reported previously in Germany. The other two (Ben 203 and Ben 204) were 99.9% similar to Streptococcus suis. Hence, all are in the low mol % G+C gram-positive bacteria division of the Bacteria. On this evidence 'N. limicola' I is phylogenetically unrelated to 'Nostocoida limicola' II, which is now known to be in the Actinobacteria, even though these two filamentous bacteria appearing in activated sludge systems have been considered to be closely related to each other historically.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of the gene encoding the glutamate dehydrogenase of  Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Given the lack of effective vaccines to control Streptococcus suis infection and  the lack of a rapid and reliable molecular diagnostic assay to detect its infection, a polyclonal antibody was raised against the whole-cell protein of S. suis type 2 and used to screen an S. suis gene library in an effort to identify protective antigen(s) and antigens of diagnostic importance. A clone that produced a 45-kDa S. suis-specific protein was identified by Western blotting. Restriction analysis showed that the gene encoding the 45-kDa protein was present on a 1.6-kb pair DraI region on the cloned chromosomal fragment. The nucleotide sequence contained an open reading frame that encoded a polypeptide of 448 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 48.8 kDa, in close agreement with the size observed on Western blots. A GenBank database search revealed that the derived amino acid sequence is homologous to the sequence of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) protein isolated from various sources, including conserved motifs and functional domains typical of the family 1-type hexameric GDH proteins, thus placing it in that family. Because of these similarities, the protein was designated the GDH of S. suis. Hybridization studies showed that the gene is conserved among the S. suis type 2 strains tested. Antiserum raised against the purified recombinant protein was reactive with a protein of the same molecular size as the recombinant protein in S. suis strains, suggesting expression of the gene in all of the isolates and antigenic conservation of the protein. The recombinant protein was reactive with serum from pigs experimentally infected with a virulent strain of S. suis type 2, suggesting that the protein might serve as an antigen of diagnostic importance to detect S. suis infection. Activity staining showed that the S. suis GDH activity is NAD(P)H dependent but, unlike the NAD(P)H-dependent GDH from various other sources, that of S. suis utilizes L-glutamate rather than alpha-ketoglutarate as the substrate. Highly virulent strains of S. suis type 2 could be distinguished from moderately virulent and avirulent strains on the basis of their GDH protein profile following activity staining on a nondenaturing gel. We examined the cellular location of the protein using a whole-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and an immunogold-labeling technique. Results showed that the S. suis GDH protein is exposed at the surface of intact cells.
TI  - Streptococcus suis meningitis, a poacher's risk.
AB  - Streptococcus suis infection is a zoonosis that has been mainly reported in pig-rearing and pork-consuming countries. The most common disease manifestation is meningitis, often associated with cochleovestibular signs. The causative agent is Streptococcus suis serotype 2, found as a commensal in the tonsils of its natural host, the pig. Persons at risk are mostly those with an occupational exposure to domestic pigs or their meat products. A case of meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis in a poacher who had killed and butchered a wild boar is reported. It appears that wild boar hunters are at additional risk of contracting the disease.

TI  - Selection of virulence-associated determinants of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 by in vivo complementation.
AB  - Within Streptococcus suis serotype 2, pathogenic, weakly pathogenic, and nonpathogenic strains can be found. We introduced a genomic library of a pathogenic strain into a weakly pathogenic strain. After infection of the library into young piglets pathogenic transformants were selected. One specific transformant containing a 3-kb fragment of the pathogenic strain appeared to be dominantly enriched in diseased pigs. The observed enrichment was not tissue specific. The selected fragment, when introduced into two different weakly pathogenic strains, increased the virulence of these strains considerably. In contrast, introduction of the corresponding fragment of a weakly pathogenic strain had only minor effects on virulence. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the selected fragment of the pathogenic strain revealed the presence of two potential open reading frames, both of which were found to be mutated in the corresponding fragment of the weakly pathogenic strain. These data strongly suggest that the selected fragment contains determinants important for virulence.
TI  - Environmentally regulated genes of Streptococcus suis: identification by the use  of iron-restricted conditions in vitro and by experimental infection of piglets.
AB  - The identification of environmentally regulated genes of Streptococcus suis by the use of iron-restricted conditions in vitro and by experimental infection of piglets is described. Eighteen unique iron-restriction-induced (iri) genes and 22 unique in-vivo-selected (ivs) genes of Strep. suis were found. None of the ivs genes was exclusively expressed in vivo. Four iri genes were identical to four clones selected in piglets. Two ivs genes were similar to genes for putative virulence factors. One of these ivs genes was identical to the epf gene of virulent Strep. suis serotype 2 strains and the other showed homology to a gene encoding a fibronectin-binding protein of Streptococcus gordonii. Two additional ivs genes showed homology to environmentally regulated genes previously identified by using an in vivo expression technology (IVET) selection system in other bacterial species. One of these showed similarity to the agrA gene of Staphylococcus aureus, a key locus involved in the regulation of numerous virulence proteins. The promoter selection system described in this paper has been successfully used for the identification of many environmentally regulated genes potentially involved in the pathogenesis of Strep. suis infections in piglets.
TI  - Relatedness of Streptococcus suis isolates of various serotypes and clinical backgrounds as evaluated by macrorestriction analysis and expression of potential virulence traits.
AB  - We evaluated the genetic diversity of Streptococcus suis isolates of different serotypes by macrorestriction analysis and elucidated possible relationships between the genetic background, expression of potential virulence traits, and source of isolation. Virulence traits included expression of serotype-specific polysaccharides, muramidase-released protein (MRP), extracellular protein factor (EF), hemolysin activity, and adherence to epithelial cells. Macrorestriction analysis of streptococcal DNA digested with restriction enzymes SmaI and ApaI allowed differentiation of single isolates that could be assigned to four major clusters, named A1, A2, B1, and B2. Comparison of the genotypic and phenotypic features of the isolates with their source of isolation showed that (i) the S. suis population examined, which originated mainly from German pigs, exhibited a genetic diversity and phenotypic patterns comparable to those found for isolates from other European countries; (ii) certain phenotypic features, such as the presence of capsular antigens of serotypes 2, 1, and 9, expression of MRP and EF, and hemolysin activity (and in particular, combinations of these features), were strongly associated with the clinical background of meningitis and septicemia; and (iii) isolates from pigs with meningitis and septicemia showed a significantly higher degree of genetic homogeneity compared to that for isolates from pigs with pneumonia and healthy pigs. Since the former isolates are considered highly virulent, this supports the theory of a clonal relationship among highly virulent strains.

TI  - Streptococcus suis peritonitis: case report.
AB  - A 45-year-old Thai man who presented with peritonitis was seen in a tertiary care centre in Thailand. An exploratory laparotomy was done because of peritonitis from abdominal trauma. Postoperatively the patient received intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole, but he developed rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure. Hemodialysis was performed. After 8 days, the peritonitis had relapsed with hypotension. The patient was given vasopressives but clinicaly deteriorated and expired on day 11. The peritoniteal fluid culture grew Streptococcus suis serotype 2 and the organism was resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents including penicillin (MIC > 32 mcg/ml) but was susceptible to vancomycin.
TI  - Evidence for horizontal transfer of SsuDAT1I restriction-modification genes to the Streptococcus suis genome.
AB  - Different strains of Streptococcus suis serotypes 1 and 2 isolated from pigs either contained a restriction-modification (R-M) system or lacked it. The R-M system was an isoschizomer of Streptococcus pneumoniae DpnII, which recognizes nucleotide sequence 5'-GATC-3'. The nucleotide sequencing of the genes encoding the R-M system in S. suis DAT1, designated SsuDAT1I, showed that the SsuDAT1I gene region contained two methyltransferase genes, designated ssuMA and ssuMB, as does the DpnII system. The deduced amino acid sequences of M. SsuMA and M.SsuMB showed 70 and 90% identity to M.DpnII and M.DpnA, respectively. However, the SsuDAT1I system contained two isoschizomeric restriction endonuclease genes, designated ssuRA and ssuRB. The deduced amino acid sequence of R.SsuRA was 49% identical to that of R.DpnII, and R.SsuRB was 72% identical to R.LlaDCHI of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris DCH-4. The four SsuDAT1I genes overlapped and were bounded by purine biosynthetic gene clusters in the following gene order: purF-purM-purN-purH-ssuMA-ssuMB-ssuRA++ +-ssuRB-purD-purE. The G+C content of the SsuDAT1I gene region (34.1%) was lower than that of the pur region (48.9%), suggesting horizontal transfer of the SsuDAT1I system. No transposable element or long-repeat sequence was found in the flanking regions. The SsuDAT1I genes were functional by themselves, as they were individually expressed in Escherichia coli. Comparison of the sequences between strains with and without the R-M system showed that only the region from 53 bp upstream of ssuMA to 5 bp downstream of ssuRB was inserted in the intergenic sequence between purH and purD and that the insertion target site was not the recognition site of SsuDAT1I. No notable substitutions or insertions could be found, and the structures were conserved among all the strains. These results suggest that the SsuDAT1I system could have been integrated into the S. suis chromosome by an illegitimate recombination mechanism.
TI  - Influence of ampicillin, ceftiofur, attenuated live PRRSV vaccine, and reduced dose Streptococcus suis exposure on disease associated with PRRSV and S. suis coinfection.
AB  - The objective of this research was to evaluate the efficacy of two antimicrobials (ampicillin and ceftiofur), a modified-live porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) vaccine, and low dose exposure to Streptococcus suis on disease associated with PRRSV/S. suis coinfection. Fifty-six, crossbred, PRRSV-free pigs were weaned at 10-12 days of age and randomly assigned to five treatment groups. All pigs were inoculated with 2ml of 10(6.4) TCID50/ml of high virulence PRRSV isolate VR-2385 intranasally at 29-31 days of age (day 0 of the study) followed 7 days later by intranasal inoculation with 2ml of 10(8.9)colony forming units(CFU)/ml S. suis type 2 isolate ISU VDL #40634/94. Pigs in group 1 (n=10) served as untreated infected positive controls. Pigs in group 2 (n=12) were treated with 5.0 mg/kg ceftiofur hydrochloride intramuscularly (IM) on days 8, 11, and 14. Pigs in group 3 (n=11) were treated with 11 mg/kg ampicillin IM on days 8-10. Pigs in group 4 (n=12) were vaccinated 14 days prior to PRRSV challenge with a commercial modified-live PRRSV vaccine. Pigs in group 5 (n=11) were exposed to a 1:100 dilution of the S. suis challenge inoculum 19 days prior to S. suis challenge. Mortality was 80, 25, 82, 83, and 36% in groups 1-5, respectively. The reduced dose S. suis exposure had some residual virulence, evidenced by S. suis induced meningitis in two pigs after exposure. Treatment with ceftiofur hydrochloride and reduced dose exposure to S. suis were the only treatments which significantly (P<0.05) reduced mortality associated with PRRSV/S. suis coinfection, significantly (P<0.05) reduced recovery of S. suis from tissues at necropsy, and significantly (P<0.05) reduced the severity of gross lung lesions.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of porcine respiratory pathogens to tilmicosin.
AB  - Bacterial isolates obtained from swine with various clinical diseases were tested for susceptibility to tilmicosin by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion tests using National Committee on Clinical Laboratory Standards methodology. The tilmicosin MIC90 was < or =0.125 microg/ml for Erysiopelothrix rhusiopathiae, < or = 1 microg/ml for Haemophilus parasuis isolates, 8 microg/ml for Actinobacillus suis and Pasteurella multocida type A, 16 microg/ml for toxigenic and nontoxigenic P. multocida type D, 64 microg/ml for Bordetella bronchiseptica, and >128 microg/ml for Staphylococcus hyicus and Streptococcus suis. The results of disk diffusion testing matched well with the MIC results for each pathogen. This in vitro survey of tilmicosin activity against various swine isolates suggests that further clinical evaluation of tilmicosin in swine may be warranted for disease associated with E. rhusiopathiae, H. parasuis, and A. suis but not B. bronchiseptica, S. suis, or S. hyicus.
TI  - A 10-year survey of antimicrobial susceptibility of streptococcus suis isolates from swine in Japan.
AB  - A number of 689 Streptococcus suis isolates collected nationwide from diseased and healthy pigs from 1987 to 1996 were surveyed for antibiotic susceptibilities to 11 drugs. No isolates resistant to amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim were found. Isolates were highly susceptible to penicillins (penicillin G, ampicillin, and amoxicillin) except cloxacillin. They were not susceptible to tetracycline, streptomycin, and kanamaycin (MIC90 50 microg/ml, > or = 100 microg/ml, and > or = 100 microg/ml, respectively). Multiple-resistant isolates (> or = 3 antimicrobial agents) were found in 20.3% of all isolates tested.
TI  - Production of muraminidase-released protein (MRP), extracellular factor (EF) and  suilysin by field isolates of Streptococcus suis capsular types 2, 1/2, 9, 7 and 3 isolated from swine in France.
AB  - A total of 323 isolates of Streptococcus suis recovered from diseased or healthy  pigs in France were serotyped. The presence of virulence-related proteins, Muraminidase-Released Protein (MRP), Extracellular Factor (EF) and Suilysin was also studied in 122 isolates of capsular types 2, 1/2, 9, 7 and 3 to evaluate their implication in virulence of S. suis. Capsular types 2, 1/2, 9, 7 and 3 were the most frequently detected (93%), with 69% for the capsular type 2 alone. Capsular types 2, 1/2, 9, 7, 3, 1, 4, 8, 18, 10 and 12 were isolated from diseased pigs, whereas types 2, 7, 9, 1/2, and 3 originated from the nasal cavities or tonsils of healthy animals. Most of the S. suis type 2 isolates recovered from diseased pigs carried MRP+ EF- Suilysin- (46%) or MRP+ EF+ Suilysin+ (28%) phenotypes. The MRP+ EF- Suilysin- phenotype was also detected in 67% of S. suis type 2 strains isolated from healthy pigs. The production of the virulence-related proteins was less frequently found in S. suis types 1/2, 9, 7 and 3 recovered either from diseased or healthy pigs. In this study, all the capsular type 1/2 strains were MRP+ EF- Suilysin- and all the S. suis type 7 harboured an MRP- EF- Suilysin- phenotype. The MRP- EF- Suilysin- phenotype was found in S. suis types 2, 3, 7 and 9 isolated from septicaemia, meningitis, pneumonia, and pleurisy. These results suggest that the presence of these proteins should not be used as a single condition for classifying the virulence of a field isolate in France.
TI  - The pathogenesis of the meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis: the unresolved questions.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is one of the most important swine pathogens world-wide. Among the serotypes described, type 2 is the serotype most frequently associated with disease. Despite increasing research in recent years, knowledge of virulence factors and the pathogenesis of the infection remain limited. This review discusses the currently available information on S. suis serotype 2 virulence factors and the pathogenesis of the meningitis caused by this important bacterial species. In addition, some hypotheses on the critical steps of the infection, such as bacterial invasion from mucosal surfaces to the bloodstream, survival of bacteria in blood, and invasion from blood into the central nervous system, are presented. Finally, the role that the stimulation of the immune system of animals (inflammatory reaction) could play during infection is also discussed. A complete understanding of the cell-interacting pathways that S. suis may follow inside the host could give important insights into the progression of disease. Further studies to delineate the mechanisms through which S. suis induces meningitis will contribute to the development of potential therapies for S. suis infections.
TI  - Interactions between Streptococcus suis serotype 2 and different epithelial cell  lines.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important swine pathogen responsible for cases of sudden death, septicaemia, meningitis, endocarditis and pneumonia. It is also recognized as a zoonotic agent in people occupationally exposed to pigs or pig products. Knowledge on virulence factors of S. suis serotype 2 is limited and the pathogenesis of the infection is poorly understood. It has been suggested that the disease due to S. suis serotype 2 begins with colonization of the nasopharyngeal epithelium, followed by either spread within the respiratory tract or invasion of the bloodstream. The mechanisms involved in the access of bacteria from the bloodstream to the central nervous system are unknown. It is possible that epithelial cells of the choroid plexus also play an important role in the pathogenesis of the meningitis. Different interactions (adhesion, invasion and toxic effects) of S. suis serotype 2 with epithelial cell lines [LLC-PK1, PK(15), A549, HeLa and MDCK] were studied and compared to those of a human pathogen which also causes meningitis, group B Streptococcus (GBS). The results showed that S. suis serotype 2, in contrast to GBS, is able to adhere to but not to invade epithelial cells. The adhesin(s) involved seem(s) to be partially masked by the capsule and are a part of the cell wall. The haemolysin produced by S. suis serotype 2 is responsible for a toxic effect observed on epithelial cells. The results described give additional evidence that pathogenesis of the infection differs between S. suis and GBS. In particular, it is possible that suilysin-positive S. suis strains use adherence and cell injury, as opposed to direct cellular invasion, as part of a complicated multistep process which leads to bacteraemia and meningitis in pigs.
TI  - The cps locus of Streptococcus suis serotype 2: genetic determinant for the synthesis of sialic acid.
AB  - The capsule of S. suis serotype 2 is composed of glucose, galatose, N-acetylglucosamine, rhamnose and sialic acid. Recently, we described a major part of the cps2 locus of S. suis serotype 2. Based on sequence homology genes encoding potential glucosyl-, galactosyl-, N-acetylglucosaminyl- and rhamnosyltransferase activities could be identified. However, we did not find genes involved in the synthesis of sialic acid. Here, we describe the cloning and characterization of a remaining part of the cps2 locus. Based on the establish sequence 11 potential genes, designated orf2L, orf2M, orf2N, cps2O to cps2T, orf2U and orf2V were identified. A gene homologous to genes involved in the polymerization of the repeating oligosaccharide unit (cps2O) as well as genes involved in the synthesis of sialic acid (cps2P to cps2T) were identified. Moreover, hybridizing experiments showed that the genes involved in the sialic acid synthesis are present in S. suis serotype 1, 2, 14, 27 and 1/2. The orf2M and orf2N regions showed similarity to proteins involved in the polysaccharide biosynthesis of other Gram-positive bacteria. However, these regions seemed to be truncated or were non-functional as the result of frame-shift or point mutations. At its 3;-end the cps2 locus contained two insertional elements (orf2U and orf2V), both of which seemed to be non-functional.
TI  - Selection of recombinant antibodies specific for pathogenic Streptococcus suis by subtractive phage display.
AB  - A semisynthetic antibody phage display library was used to select recombinant antibodies directed against surface components of a pathogenic strain of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 and against extracellular factor (EF), a protein known to be exclusively associated with pathogenic S. suis serotype 2 strains. Three distinct monoclonal phage antibodies directed against conformational epitopes of surface protein components of S. suis were selected. In addition, three different monoclonal phage antibodies were isolated that recognized EF. To isolate antibody fragments that recognize epitopes specific for a pathogenic S. suis serotype 2 strain, compared to a nonpathogenic serotype 2 strain, we applied a subtractive selection procedure. With this procedure, only one distinct phage antibody was found, and it was shown to be directed against EF. This demonstrates the selectivity of the applied procedure and confirms that EF is indeed differentially expressed by pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains. It also shows that EF is a very dominant antigen in phage antibody selections.
TI  - Detection of Streptococcus suis by in situ hybridization, indirect immunofluorescence, and peroxidase-antiperoxidase assays in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections from pigs.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important pathogen in pigs and is considered a zoonotic  agent. To aid diagnosis of infection caused by S. suis, a species-specific probe targeting 16S ribosomal RNA was designed and used for fluorescent in situ hybridization. Two additional immunohistochemical detection methods, an indirect immunofluorescence assay and a peroxidase-antiperoxidase method, using polyclonal antibodies also were developed. The specificity of the oligonucleotide probe was examined by whole-cell and dot-blot hybridization against reference strains of the 35 serotypes of S. suis and other closely related streptococci and other bacteria commonly isolated from pigs. The probe was specific for S. suis serotypes 1-31. The specificity of the polyclonal antibodies, which has previously been evaluated for use in diagnostic bacteriology for typing of serotype 2, was further evaluated in experimentally infected murine tissue with pure culture of different serotypes of S. suis, related streptococci, and other bacteria commonly found in pigs. The polyclonal antibodies against S. suis serotype 2 cross-reacted with serotypes 1 and 1/2 in these assays. The in situ hybridization and the immunohistochemical methods were used for detection of S. suis in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections of brain, endocardium, and lung from pigs infected with S. suis. The methods developed were able to detect single cells of S. suis in situ in the respective samples, whereas no signal was observed from control tissue sections that contained organisms other than S. suis. These techniques are suitable for determining the in vivo localization of S. suis for research and diagnostic purposes.
TI  - Distribution of Streptococcus suis capsular types in 1999.
AB  
TI  - Distribution of capsular types and production of muramidase-released protein (MRP) and extracellular factor (EF) of Streptococcus suis strains isolated from diseased pigs in seven European countries.
AB  - Streptococcus suis strains (n=411), isolated from diseased pigs in seven European countries were serotyped using specific antisera against serotype 1 to 28, and were phenotyped on the basis of their muramidase-released-protein (MRP) and extracellular-factor protein (EF) production. Overall, S. suis serotype 2 appeared to be most prevalent (32%), followed by serotype 9 (20%) and serotype 1 (12%). Serotype 2 was most frequently isolated in France, Italy and Spain, whereas serotype 9 was most frequently isolated in Belgium, The Netherlands and Germany. In the United Kingdom serotypes 1 and 14 were most frequently isolated. High percentages of S. suis serotype 1, 2, 1/2 and 14 strains, isolated from tissues associated with S. suis infections such as brain, serosa, joint, heart and organs expressed the EF-protein, indicating that in these serotypes expression of EF is likely to be associated with virulence. In contrast, strains belonging to serotype 7 and 9, isolated from tissues associated with S. suis infections did not produce EF. These results strongly suggest that in the serotypes 7 and 9 EF expression is not related to virulence. More than 80% of the S. suis serotype 9 strains produced an MRP* protein, a high molecular variant of the 136kDa MRP. Expression of MRP* in serotype 9 strains is possibly associated with virulence.
TI  - Pathogenesis of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus-induced increase in susceptibility to Streptococcus suis infection.
AB  - Eighty 3-week-old crossbred pigs were randomly assigned to six groups (13-14 pigs/group). Group 1 pigs served as uninoculated controls, group 2 pigs were inoculated intranasally (i.n.) with Streptococcus suis serotype 2, group 3 pigs were inoculated i.n. with a modified live porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) vaccine, group 4 pigs were inoculated i.n. with the same vaccine and with S. suis, group 5 pigs were inoculated i.n. with VR-2385 (a high-virulence strain of PRRSV), and group 6 pigs were inoculated i.n. with VR-2385 and S. suis. Pigs exposed to both PRRSV and S. suis were inoculated with PRRSV 7 days prior to S. suis inoculation. The pigs were 26 days old when inoculated with S. suis. Respiratory disease was significantly more severe in groups 5 and 6. Mortality rate was the highest in group 6 (87.5%). This rate was significantly higher than that observed in all other groups except group 4 (37.5%). The mortality rate in group 2, inoculated with S. suis alone, was 14.3%. No pigs from groups 1, 3, or 5 died prior to the scheduled necropsies at 10 and 28 days postinoculation with PRRSV (DPI). To study the effect of PRRSV and/or S. suis on pulmonary clearance by pulmonary intravascular macrophages, six pigs from each group were intravenously infused with 3% copper phthalocyanine tetrasulfonic acid in saline prior to necropsy at 10 DPI. Mean copper levels in the lungs of pigs in groups 2, 5, and 6 were significantly lower than those in control pigs. The mean percentage of lung tissue grossly affected by pneumonia at 10 DPI was 0%, 1%, 0%, 3%, 64%, and 62% for groups 1-6, respectively. Both gross and microscopic interstitial pneumonia lesions were significantly more severe in the VR2385-inoculated groups (5 and 6). PRRSV was isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid collected at necropsy from 100% of the pigs in groups 5 and 6, 71.4% of pigs in group 4, 38.5% of pigs in group 3, and none of the pigs in groups 1 or 2. Streptococcus suis serotype 2 was cultured from the internal tissues of 7.7%, 28.6%, and 78.6% of the pigs in groups 2, 4, and 6, respectively. Streptococcus suis serotype 2 was isolated from whole blood at necropsy from 7.7%, 35.7%, and 78.6% of pigs in groups 2, 4, and 6, respectively. Significantly more pigs in group 6 had S. suis isolated from whole blood and internal tissues. In summary, both high-virulence PRRSV and S. suis decreased copper clearance, and the incidence of isolation of S. suis and PRRSV was higher in dually inoculated pigs. PRRSV-induced suppression of pulmonary intravascular macrophage function may in part explain PRRSV-associated increased susceptibility to S. suis infection.
TI  - Effects of iron and manganese availability on growth and production of superoxide dismutase by Streptococcus suis.
AB  - A complex medium supported good growth of the type strain of Streptococcus suis irrespective of the presence or absence of a high concentration (1 microM) of the iron chelating agent, ethylenediamine di-o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid. Good growth was also obtained using a complex medium that had been treated with Chelex-100 to reduce the iron content, but only if this medium was supplemented with manganese; supplementation with iron had little effect. Collectively, these results indicate that S. suis requires manganese, but not iron, for growth. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of cell extracts followed by activity staining revealed the presence of a single manganese-cofactored superoxide dismutase; activity staining and enzyme assays revealed that manganese availability during growth affected the activity of the superoxide dismutase in cell extracts. The results are discussed with respect to the capacity of S. suis to avoid damage by reactive oxygen species.
TI  - Efficacy of antimicrobial treatments and vaccination regimens for control of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus and Streptococcus suis coinfection of nursery pigs.
AB  - Seventy-six, crossbred, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV)-free pigs were weaned at 12 days of age and randomly assigned to seven groups of 10 to 11 pigs each. Pigs in group 1 served as unchallenged controls. Pigs in groups 2 to 7 were challenged intranasally with 2 ml of high-virulence PRRSV isolate VR-2385 (10(4.47) 50% tissue culture infective doses per 2 ml) on day 0 of the study (30 days of age). Seven days after PRRSV challenge, pigs in groups 2 to 7 were challenged intranasally with 2 ml of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (10(8.30) CFU/2 ml). Group 2 pigs served as untreated positive controls. Antimicrobial treatments included daily intramuscular injection with 66,000 IU of procaine penicillin G per kg of body weight on days 8 to 10 (group 3), drinking water medication with 23.1 mg of tiamulin per kg during days 8 to 10 (group 4), and daily intramuscular injection of 5.0 mg of ceftiofur hydrochloride per kg on days 8 to 10 (group 5). Vaccination regimens included two intramuscular doses of an autogenous killed S. suis vaccine (group 6) prior to S. suis challenge or a single 2-ml intramuscular dose of an attenuated live PRRSV vaccine (group 7) 2 weeks prior to PRRSV challenge. Mortality was 0, 63, 45, 54, 9, 40, and 81% in groups 1 to 7, respectively. Ceftiofur treatment was the only regimen that significantly (P < 0. 05) reduced mortality associated with PRRSV and S. suis coinfection. The other treatments and vaccinations were less effective. We conclude that ceftiofur administered by injection for three consecutive days following S. suis challenge was the most effective regimen for minimizing disease associated with PRRSV and S. suis coinfection.
TI  - Coinfection by porcine circoviruses and porcine parvovirus in pigs with naturally acquired postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome.
AB  - Postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) is an emerging disease in swine. Recently, the disease has been reproduced with inocula containing a newly described porcine circovirus (PCV), designated PCV 2, and porcine parvovirus (PPV). In order to determine if these viruses interact in naturally acquired PMWS, affected tissues from field cases were examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for PCV 2 and PPV, as well as by PCR for the other recognized porcine circovirus, PCV 1. Porcine circovirus 2 was detected by PCR or IHC in affected fixed or frozen tissues from 69 of 69 cases of PMWS collected over 3 years from 25 farms. Porcine parvovirus was detected in 12 of the same cases, and PCV 1 was detected in 9 of 69; however, an apparent decrease was found in the sensitivity of the PCRs used to detect the latter 2 viruses when fixed tissue from the same cases were compared with the use of frozen tissues. Porcine circovirus 2 was not detected by PCR in affected tissues from 16 age-matched pigs that had Streptococcus suis-associated disease. Electron microscopic examination of plasma pooled from 15 pigs with PMWS revealed the presence of PCV and PPV, whereas these viruses were not observed in pooled plasma from 5 age-matched clinically normal pigs. These results confirm and extend previous findings documenting a consistent association of PCV 2 with PMWS. As well, infection by PPV or PCV 1 or both may be an important cofactor in the pathogenesis of some, but apparently not all, cases of PMWS.
TI  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 interactions with human brain microvascular endothelial cells.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is a worldwide causative agent of many forms of swine infection and is also recognized as a zoonotic agent causing human disease, including meningitis. The pathogenesis of S. suis infections is poorly understood. Bacteria circulate in the bloodstream in the nonimmune host until they come in contact with brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC) forming the blood-brain barrier. The bacterial polysaccharide capsule confers antiphagocytic properties. It is known that group B streptococci (GBS) invade and damage BMEC, which may be a primary step in the pathogenesis of neonatal meningitis. Interactions between S. suis and human endothelial cells were studied to determine if they differ from those between GBS and endothelial cells. Invasion assays performed with BMEC and human umbilical vein endothelial cells demonstrated that unlike GBS, S. suis serotype 2 could not invade either type of cell. Adherence assays showed that S. suis adhered only to BMEC, whereas GBS adhered to both types of cell. These interactions were not affected by the presence of a capsule, since acapsular mutants from both bacterial species adhered similarly compared to the wild-type strains. Lactate dehydrogenase release measurements indicated that some S. suis strains were highly cytotoxic for BMEC, even more than GBS, whereas others were not toxic at all. Cell damage was related to suilysin (S. suis hemolysin) production, since only suilysin-producing strains were cytotoxic and cytotoxicity could be inhibited by cholesterol and antisuilysin antibodies. It is possible that hemolysin-positive S. suis strains use adherence and suilysin-induced BMEC injury, as opposed to direct cellular invasion, to proceed from the circulation to the central nervous system.
TI  - Dilemma of the virulence of Strptococcus suis strains.
AB  
TI  - Presence of the Streptococcus suis suilysin gene and expression of MRP and EF correlates with high virulence in Streptococcus suis type 2 isolates.
AB  - Nineteen Streptococccus suis type 2 isolates that had been analyzed previously for hemolysin production, ribotype, and virulence in pigs were examined for presence of the gene coding for suilysin by PCR amplification, and southern blot and hybridization techniques. Based on southern blot and hybridization analysis, all isolates tested contained at least a portion of the suilysin gene. PCR amplification of the entire gene resulted in gene fragments from five of the seven highly virulent isolates and none of the moderately virulent or avirulent isolates. Additional PCR analysis showed that mutation or deletions at the 5' end of the suilysin gene in the less virulent isolates prevented amplification of the sly gene fragment from those isolates. The MRP+ (muramidase-released protein) EF+ (extracellular protein) phenotype was also expressed by the same five highly virulent/sly+ isolates.
TI  - Determination of the cell adhesion specificity of Streptococcus suis with the complete set of monodeoxy analogues of globotriose.
AB  - Streptococcus suis causes meningitis and other serious infections in pigs and humans, and binds to host cell globotriosylceramide. In order to determine the essential hydroxyls involved in binding, the complete set of monodeoxy derivatives of the receptor trisaccharide Gal alpha1-Gal beta1-4Glc were tested as inhibitors of bacterial hemagglutination. Removal of the 4''-, 6'', 2' or 3'-hydroxyls abolished inhibitory activity, which indicated that they were critically involved in binding. The same results were obtained using synthetic lipid-linked monodeoxy derivatives of the trisaccharides in a thin-layer overlay assay. The P(N) and P(O) subtypes of the S. suis adhesin showed similar binding patterns. The hydroxyls of the glucose moiety were not critical for binding, although the adhesin binds better to the trisaccharide Gal alpha1-4Gal beta1-4Glc than the disaccharide Gal alpha1-4Gal.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of the gene encoding O-acetylserine lyase from Streptococcus suis.
AB  - We have cloned and sequenced a gene encoding O-acetylserine lyase from Streptococcus suis. The gene encodes a protein of 309 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 32,038 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence showed more extensive similarities to the CysK proteins than to the CysM proteins of other bacteria. The cloned gene was inserted into a pTrcHisB histidine hexamer expression vector. A 38-kDa fusion protein was expressed in a cysMK auxotrophic mutant of Salmonella typhimurium and complemented the auxotrophic properties of the mutant. Furthermore, the transformants could grow in minimal defined media supplemented with not only sulfide but also thiosulfate as a sole sulfur source. These data indicated that the cloned gene encodes a protein that was a functional homolog of the CysM in S. typhimurium.
TI  - Sequence analysis of a small cryptic plasmid isolated from Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - A small cryptic plasmid designated pSSU1 was isolated from Streptococcus suis serotype 2 strain DAT1. The complete sequence of pSSU1 was 4975 bp and contained six major open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 and ORF2 encode for proteins highly homologous to CopG and RepB of the pMV158 family, respectively. ORF5 encodes for a protein highly homologous to Mob of pMV158. ORF4 encodes for a protein highly homologous to orf3 of pVA380-1 of S. ferus, but its function is unknown. There was no similarity between ORF3 and ORF6 and other protein sequences. In this plasmid, the ORF1 (CopG protein) was preceded by two multiples of direct repeat and the conserved nucleotides that could be the double-strand origin (DSO) of rolling circle replication (RCR) mechanism. The ORF5 (Mob protein) was followed by a potential hairpin loop that could be the single-strand origin (SSO) of RCR mechanism. The sequence, which was complementary to the leader region of Rep mRNA, was homologous to the countertranscribed RNA (ctRNA) of pLS1. Moreover, a 5-amino acid conserved sequence was found in C terminal of Rep and putative Rep proteins of several pMV158 family plasmids. These observations suggest that this plasmid replicates by use of the rolling circle mechanism.
TI  - Hybridization analysis of the gene encoding a hemolysin (suilysin) of Streptococcus suis type 2: evidence for the absence of the gene in some isolates.
AB  - A hemolysin gene was cloned from a virulent strain of Streptococcus suis type 2 strain 1933. Analysis of the gene and its product revealed that it is identical to a previously reported hemolysin (suilysin) of S. suis type 2. Southern hybridization analysis of the digested total genomic DNA from S. suis with the cloned hemolysin DNA sequences as probe indicated that the hemolysin gene is present as a single copy on the genome. Genomic DNA of 63 isolates of S. suis encompassing all known serotypes were examined by DNA hybridization and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies for the presence of the hemolysin gene homolog. The results of both techniques were identical and demonstrated the absence of the hemolysin gene in some isolates. In DNA hybridization studies, three DNA probes derived from the hemolysin encoding gene were used. Results showed that sequences encoding the C-terminal 257 amino acid residues (Probe 1) were the most conserved and hybridized to a 1.2 kb fragment in 32 (51%) strains and a 4.0 kb fragment in 23 (36%) strains respectively. Thus, Probe 2 hybridized to the DNA of 55 (87%) of the isolates tested. The first probe (Probe 1) comprising almost the entire hemolysin gene and the third probe (Probe 3) which consisted of the N-terminal sequences hybridized only to a 4.0 kb fragment in 23 (36%) of the strains tested. Eight (13%) of the strains tested were hybridization and PCR negative. The hybridization of the C-terminal end sequences (Probe 2) to the 1.2 kb fragment in 32 (51%) of the strains and the lack of hybridization of the probes to eight (13%) strains may suggest the presence of different types of hemolysin molecule in S. suis strains.
TI  - Streptococcus suis meningitis: report of a case.
AB  - A 50-year-old policeman who presented with subacute meningitis, bilateral rectus  muscle palsies, dizziness and early bilateral deafness was reported. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed polymorphonuclear pleocytosis with Gram-positive cocci. Blood and CSF cultures grew Streptococcus viridans which subsequently identified to be Streptococcus suis. The patient improved after treatment but deafness persisted.
TI  - Experimental exposure of young pigs using a pathogenic strain of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 and evaluation of this method for disease prevention.
AB  - Control of Streptococcus suis infections and associated disease have proven to be a difficult challenge under most farm conditions. The objective of this study was to experimentally expose young pigs with a pathogenic strain of S. suis serotype 2 as a means of controlling the disease in a commercial swine farm. Prior to the start of the study, the pathogenic S. suis strain responsible for mortality in the farm was identified and used to experimentally inoculate baby piglets. Over a 3-week period, groups of pigs were selected (100 pigs/wk) and divided into 2 groups: control (50 pigs/week) and experimentally exposed (50 pigs/week). Pigs in the experimentally exposed group were inoculated at 5 d old by tonsillar swabbing with the pathogenic S. suis farm isolate. The effect of exposure with this pathogenic strain was evaluated during the nursery and finishing stages and was based on: morbidity (pigs with central nervous signs (CNS) and/or lameness), mortality and number of treatments required by pigs that had either CNS or lameness. The relative risk (RR) of acquiring disease due to S. suis infection was also calculated. Results showed that morbidity in the experimentally exposed groups was lower than in the control group and these results were statistically different (P = 0.006). Experimentally exposed pigs also showed a statistically significant reduction in lameness problems (P = 0.012), but not in CNS (P = 0.20) or mortality (P = 0.59). Pigs in the control group had an increased RR of 4.76, 8.77 and 2.7 for morbidity, to have lameness or to have CNS signs, respectively. In conclusion, experimental exposure of young pigs with the farm's pathogenic S. suis strain at a young age, had a positive effect in reducing clinical signs characteristics of S. suis infection. This method constitutes a novel approach to the control of S. suis infections in swine farms.
TI  - Epithelial invasion and cell lysis by virulent strains of Streptococcus suis is enhanced by the presence of suilysin.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important pathogen of pigs causing arthritis, pneumonia  and meningitis and is an occupational disease of farmers and those in the meat industry. As with other streptococci, both virulent and avirulent strains of S. suis are frequently carried asymptomatically in the tonsillar crypts and nasal cavities. Little is known about the process by which virulent strains cross the mucosal epithelia to generate systemic disease and whether this process requires expression of specific bacterial virulence factors. Although putative virulence factors have been postulated, no specific role in the disease process has yet been demonstrated for these factors. This study is the first demonstration that virulent strains of S. suis both invade and lyse HEp-2 cells, a continuous laryngeal epithelial cell line, and that at least one bacterial virulence factor, suilysin, is involved in this process.
TI  - Rapid PCR test for Streptococcus suis serotype 7.
AB  - Recent epidemiological studies on Streptococcus suis infections in pigs indicated that, besides serotypes 1, 2 and 9, serotype 7 is also frequently associated with diseased animals. For the latter serotype, however, no rapid and sensitive diagnostic methods are available. This hampers prevention and control programs. Here, we describe the development of a type-specific PCR test for the rapid and sensitive detection of S. suis serotype 7. The test is based on DNA sequences of capsular (cps) genes specific for serotype 7. These sequences were identified by cross-hybridization of several individual cps genes with the chromosomal DNAs of 35 different S. suis serotypes.
TI  - The cps genes of Streptococcus suis serotypes 1, 2, and 9: development of rapid serotype-specific PCR assays.
AB  - We developed three type-specific PCR assays for the rapid and sensitive detection of Streptococcus suis serotype 1 (plus 14), serotype 2 (plus 1/2), and serotype 9 strains in tonsillar specimens from pigs. The PCR primers were based on the sequences of type-specific capsular genes of S. suis serotype 1, 2, and 9 strains. We recently characterized a major part of the capsular biosynthesis (cps) locus of S. suis serotype 2. Here we extended these studies and characterized major parts of the cps loci of S. suis serotypes 1 and 9. Type-specific genes were identified by cross-hybridization experiments between the individual cps genes and chromosomal DNAs from the 35 different serotypes. Four genes of S. suis serotype 1 specifically hybridized with serotype 1 and 14 strains only. Five genes of S. suis serotype 2 specifically hybridized with serotype 2 and 1/2 strains only, and two genes of S. suis serotype 9 specifically hybridized with serotype 9 strains. Until now rapid and sensitive diagnostic tests were available only for pathogenic strains of serotype 2 and highly pathogenic strains of serotype 1. The serotype-specific PCR assays can therefore be useful tools for the identification of serotype 1, 14, 2, 1/2, and 9 strains both for diagnostic purposes and in epidemiological and transmission studies. Therefore, these tests may facilitate control and eradication programs.
TI  - [Streptococcus suis meningitis and neurophysiology of the acoustic system. First  case report from Austria].
AB  - Meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis was diagnosed in a 63 year old female in  Austria. Sixteen months after onset she still suffers from ataxia, disturbance of gait and bilateral hearing impairment. Being a farmer, the patient belongs to a recognized high-risk-group, as most other infected people do. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no report of a human infection by Streptococcus suis in Austria so far. The results of neurophysiological tests excluded a direct lesion to the cochlea during the acute phase of meningitis, and thus, are in contrast to the guinea-pig-model by Kay, who showed suppurative labyrinthitis being the cause of hearing loss. The present knowledge of Streptococcus suis meningitis with respect to neurophysiology, pathogenesis, epidemiology and increasing resistance against antibiotics is discussed.
TI  - Heat-killed Streptococcus suis capsular type 2 strains stimulate tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6 production by murine macrophages.
AB  - Streptococcus suis capsular type 2 is an important etiological agent of swine meningitis, and it is also a zoonotic agent. Since mononuclear phagocytes have been suggested to play a central role in the pathogenesis of meningitis, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the capacity of whole killed S. suis type 2 organisms to induce the release of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) by murine macrophages. Induction of cytokines was evaluated in the presence or absence of phorbol ester (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate [PMA]) costimulation. Results showed that S. suis type 2 stimulated the production of both cytokines in a concentration- and time-dependent fashion. Although large doses of bacteria were required for maximal cytokine release, titers were similar to those obtained with the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) positive control. An increase in cytokine release was observed with both S. suis and LPS with PMA costimulation. Experiments with cytochalasin-treated macrophages showed that the stimulation of cytokine production was phagocytosis independent. When macrophages were stimulated with an unencapsulated mutant, an increase in TNF production was observed, but the absence of the capsule had no effect on IL-6 production. In fact, whereas purified capsular polysaccharide of S. suis failed to induce cytokine release, purified S. suis cell wall induced both TNF and, to a lesser extent, IL-6. IL-6 secretion probably requires some distinct stimuli which differ from those of TNF. Finally, the S. suis putative virulence factors suilysin and extracellular protein EF showed no cytokine-stimulating activity. The ability of S. suis to trigger macrophages to produce proinflammatory cytokines may have an important role in the initiation and development of meningitis caused by this microorganism.
TI  - Immunomagnetic isolation of Streptococcus suis serotypes 2 and 1/2 from swine tonsils.
AB  - Isolation of specific serotypes of Streptococcus suis from the tonsils, nasal cavities, and genital tract is difficult, since low-pathogenic serotypes and untypeable strains also inhabit these sites. An immunomagnetic separation (IMS) technique for the selective isolation of S. suis serotypes 2 and 1/2 was standardized. Superparamagnetic polystyrene beads (immunomagnetic beads or IMB) were coated with either a purified monoclonal antibody (MAb) directed to a capsular sialic acid-containing epitope or purified rabbit immunoglobulin G (polyclonal antibody [PAb]), both specific for S. suis serotypes 2 and 1/2. The amount of antibodies required for optimum coating of the beads, the number of IMB required for optimum bacterial recovery, and the nonspecific carryover were considerably higher with the MAb-IMS technique than with the PAb-IMS technique. The sensitivity of the IMS technique was 10(1) CFU/0.1 g of tonsil. The presence of serotype 1/2 bacteria did not considerably affect the recovery rate of a serotype 2 strain and vice versa. To validate the technique, PAb-coated beads were used to study 192 tonsils from animals from S. suis serotype 2- or 1/2-infected herds. Results showed that significantly more positive tonsils were detected by the IMS technique than by the standard procedure. This method represents an innovative and highly sensitive approach for the isolation of S. suis serotypes 2 and 1/2 from carrier animals.
TI  - Detection of virulent strains of Streptococcus suis type 2 and highly virulent strains of Streptococcus suis type 1 in tonsillar specimens of pigs by PCR.
AB  - We developed a PCR assay for the rapid and sensitive detection of virulent Streptococcus suis type 2 and highly virulent S. suis type 1 in tonsillar specimens from pigs. The PCR primers were based on the sequence of the gene encoding the EF-protein of virulent S. suis type 2 strains (MRP+EF+) and highly virulent S. suis type 1 strains (MRP(s)EF+) and of the EF protein of weakly virulent S. suis type 2 strains (MRP+EF). The latter strains give rise to larger PCR products than the virulent strains of S. suis type 1 and 2. A positive control template was included in the assay to identify false negative results. The PCR was evaluated using tonsillar specimens from herds known (or suspected) to be infected and herds without an S. suis history. The results obtained with the PCR assay were compared with the results obtained with a newly developed bacteriological examination. In this bacteriological examination we were able to identify the EF-positive strains directly in the tonsillar specimens. From the 99 tonsils examined, 48 were positive in the PCR and 51 negative. All specimens from which EF-positive S. suis strains were isolated were also positive in the PCR assay. Three samples were positive in the PCR, but negative by bacteriological examination. The results demonstrated that the PCR is a highly specific and sensitive diagnostic tool for the detection of pigs carrying virulent strains of S. suis type 2 and highly virulent strains of type 1. Application of the assay may contribute to the control of S. suis infections.
TI  - Agents of the "suis-ide diseases" of swine: Actinobacillus suis, Haemophilus parasuis, and Streptococcus suis.
AB  - In recent years, Actinobacillus suis, Haemophilus parasuis, and Streptococcus suis have emerged as important pathogens of swine, particularly in high health status herds. Their association with a wide range of serious clinical conditions and has given rise to the moniker "suis-ide diseases." These organisms are early colonizers and, for that reason, are difficult to control by management procedures such as segregated early weaning. Vaccination, serodiagnostic testing, and even serotyping are complicated by the presence of multiple serotypes, cross-reactive antigens, and the absence of clear markers for virulence. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of the pathogenesis, epidemiology, and management of the causative agents of the "suis-ide diseases" of swine.
TI  - Low prevalence of antibodies against the zoonotic agents Brucella abortus, Leptospira spp., Streptococcus suis serotype II, hantavirus, and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus among veterinarians and pig farmers in the southern part of The Netherlands.
AB  - Serum samples from 102 veterinarians and 191 pig farmers from the southern part of the Netherlands were investigated for antibodies against Brucella abortus, Leptospira spp, Streptococcus suis serotype II, Hantavirus (HV), and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). All samples were collected in 1993 and stored until this study was performed. The prevalence of antibodies against B.abortus in veterinarians (4.5%) was significantly higher (P = 0.01) than in pig farmers (0%). None of the veterinarians (0%) and only one pig farmer (0.5%) had antibodies against Leptospira spp. Furthermore, significantly (P = 0.015) more veterinarians (6%) than pig farmers (1%) had antibody titres against muramidase-released protein (MRP),a protein of pathogenic S. suis serotype II strains. None of the veterinarians and a total of 3 (1.6%) pig farmers had antibody titres against HV. The prevalence of antibodies against LCMV tended to be higher in pig farmers (2.6%) than in veterinarians (0%) (P = 0.10). It can be concluded that the prevalence of antibodies against the investigated zoonotic agents in veterinarians and pig farmers is low.
TI  - Distribution of Streptococcus suis capsular types in 1998.
AB  
TI  - The presence of muramidase released protein and extracellular factor protein in various serotypes of Streptococcus suis isolated from diseased and healthy pigs in Spain.
AB  - A total of 142 strains from different serotypes of Streptococcus suis isolated in Spain from diseased pigs (88 strains) and healthy carrier pigs (54 strains) were studied for the presence of a muramidase released protein (MRP) and an extracellular factor (EF). The following five phenotypes: MRP+EF+, MRP+EF-, MRP-EF+, MRP+EF* and MRP*EF- were detected. A high percentage of S. suis serotype 2 strains isolated from diseased pigs (84 per cent) belonged to phenotype MRP+EF+, but this phenotype has also been noticed in other serotypes (serotypes 1, 1/2 and 14). Both proteins were detected in S. suis serotype 2 strains (26%) isolated from healthy carrier pigs and one of both proteins in serotypes 1 and 14 (phenotype MRP+EF*). The isolation of S. suis strains from healthy pigs which have shown both proteins may support the epidemiological significance of these carriers in the maintenance, transmission and distribution of virulent strains within and between swine farms.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the cps locus of Streptococcus suis serotype 2: the capsule protects against phagocytosis and is an important virulence factor.
AB  - To study the role of the capsule of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 in virulence, we generated two isogenic mutants disturbed in capsule production. For that purpose, we first cloned and characterized a major part of the capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis (cps) locus of S. suis serotype 2. Based on the established sequence, 14 open reading frames (ORFs), designated Orf2Z, Orf2Y, Orf2X, and Cps2A to Cps2K, were identified. Twelve ORFs belonged to a single transcriptional unit. The gene products of 11 of these ORFs showed similarity to proteins involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis of other gram-positive microorganisms. Nonencapsulated isogenic mutants were generated in the cps2B and cps2EF genes by insertional mutagenesis. In contrast to the wild-type S. suis serotype 2 strain, the nonencapsulated strains were highly sensitive to ingestion by porcine alveolar lung macrophages in vitro. More importantly, the nonencapsulated mutant strains were completely avirulent in young germfree pigs after intranasal inoculation. These observations indicate that the capsule of S. suis serotype 2 plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of S. suis serotype 2 infections.

TI  - Associations of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 ribotype profiles with clinical disease and antimicrobial resistance.
AB  - A total of 122 Streptococcus suis serotype 2 strains were characterized thoroughly by comparing clinical and pathological observations, ribotype profiles, and antimicrobial resistance. Twenty-one different ribotype profiles were found and compared by cluster analysis, resulting in the identification of three ribotype clusters. A total of 58% of all strains investigated were of two ribotypes belonging to different ribotype clusters. A remarkable relationship existed between the observed ribotype profiles and the clinical-pathological observations because strains of one of the two dominant ribotypes were almost exclusively isolated from pigs with meningitis, while strains of the other dominant ribotype were never associated with meningitis. This second ribotype was isolated only from pigs with pneumonia, endocarditis, pericarditis, or septicemia. Cluster analysis revealed that strains belonging to the same ribotype cluster as one of the dominant ribotypes came from pigs that showed clinical signs similar to those of pigs infected with strains with the respective dominant ribotype profiles. Furthermore, strains belonging to different ribotype clusters had totally different patterns of resistance to antibiotics because strains isolated from pigs with meningitis were resistant to sulfamethazoxazole and strains isolated from pigs with pneumonia, endocarditis, pericarditis, or septicemia were resistant to tetracycline.
TI  - Relatedness of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 isolates from different geographic origins as evaluated by molecular fingerprinting and phenotyping.
AB  - The genetic diversity of 88 Streptococcus suis serotype 2 isolates which were recovered from various countries was examined by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis with three primers. This bacterial collection included 80 isolates of porcine origin and 8 of human origin. This investigation allowed the identification of 23 RAPD types containing 1 to 30 isolates originating from one to six countries. Common RAPD patterns were found between human and pig isolates. The isolates were also tested for the production of virulent factors such as hemolysin, muramidase-released protein (MRP), and extracellular factor (EF). All isolates exhibiting the virulent phenotype hemolysin+ MRP+ EF+ clearly clustered on the basis of fingerprinting by RAPD analysis. In a similar way, most of isolates with the hemolysin- MRP- EF- phenotype were assigned to one RAPD cluster. Therefore, RAPD clusters are more related to the phenotype defined with hemolysin, MRP, and EF than to the geographic origin of the isolates. These data indicate that RAPD analysis used in conjunction with phenotypic methods provides a reliable method for the assessment of the clonal relationship between S. suis isolates responsible for infections in pigs or humans, especially for those exhibiting the classic "virulent" phenotype hemolysin+ MRP+ EF+.

AB  
TI  - Simultaneous flow cytometric measurement of Streptococcus suis phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear and mononuclear blood leukocytes.
AB  - A simple flow cytometric method was used to study simultaneously the phagocytosis of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 by polymorphonuclear and mononuclear blood leukocytes from swine and humans. Using this method with a bacteria-to-leukocytes ratio of 10:1 and after 60 min of incubation, 80.2 +/- 2.8% of swine granulocytes and 77.0 +/- 2.8% of swine monocytes were shown to contain FITC-labelled S. suis serotype 2 strain 735. Using the same strain, FITC-labelled bacteria were found in 95.5 +/- 3.2% of human granulocytes and in 92.8 +/- 3.6% of human monocytes. The phagocytosis rates of avirulent and virulent strains of S. suis were not significantly different.
TI  - Trends in the resistance to antimicrobial agents of Streptococcus suis isolates from Denmark and Sweden.
AB  - This study was conducted to determine the MIC values of historical and contemporary Streptoccocus suis (serotypes 2 and 7) from Denmark and S. suis (serotype 2) from Sweden. A total of 52 isolates originating from 1967 through 1981 and 156 isolates from 1992 through 1997 in Denmark and 13 isolates from Sweden were examined for their MICs against 20 different antimicrobial agents. Most antimicrobials were active against most isolates. A frequent occurrence of resistance to sulphamethoxazole was observed, with most resistance among historic isolates of serotype 7 and least resistance among isolates from Sweden. A large number of the isolates was resistant to macrolides. However, all historic serotype 2 isolates from Denmark were susceptible, whereas 20.4% of the contemporary isolates were resistant. Among serotype 7 isolates 23.3% of the historic isolates were resistant to macrolides, whereas resistance was found in 44.8% of the contemporary isolates. All isolates from Sweden were susceptible to macrolides. Time-associated frequency of resistance to tetracycline was also found. Only a single historic isolate of serotype 2 was resistant to tetracycline, whereas 43.9% of the contemporary serotype 2 isolates and 15.5% of the contemporary serotype 7 isolates were resistant. Only one (7.7%) of the isolates from Sweden was resistant. The differences in resistance between historic and contemporary isolates from Denmark were statistically significant. This study demonstrated a significant serotype-associated difference in the susceptibility to macrolides and tetracycline and demonstrated that an increase in resistance among S. suis isolates has taken place during the last 15 years to the two most commonly used antimicrobial agents (tylosin and tetracycline) in pig production in Denmark.
TI  - Characterisation of the gene encoding suilysin from Streptococcus suis and expression in field strains.
AB  - The gene encoding suilysin was cloned from Streptococcus suis serotype 2 strain P1/7. Analysis of the nucleotide and translated amino acid sequence confirmed suilysin to be a member of the thiol activated cytolysin group (TACY). The pneumolysin from Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most closely related orthologous gene known. Suilysin was overexpressed in E. coli in an active haemolytic form. A strong correlation between the presence of the sly gene and haemolytic activity in the supernatant of S. suis field strains was found. Of 158 strains tested, 63% contained the gene. Within the (most prevalent) serotype 2, the sly gene was demonstrated in 95% of the strains isolated in Eurasia, but only in 7% of the strains from North America.
TI  - Prolonged persistence of an epidemic Streptococcus suis strain in a closed pig population.

TI  - Use of the protective antigen of Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and latex agglutination.
AB  - To establish a safe and convenient serodiagnostic method for swine erysipelas, a  purified protective protein antigen of Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, which included a large amount of protective protein (64 kDa protein), was used for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the latex agglutination (LA) test. In the ELISA, the antisera to four different serovars (1a, 2, 5 and 20) of E. rhusiopathiae exhibit a positive reaction, while antisera to other species of bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus suis, Rhodococcus equi and Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis) exhibit a negative reaction. In the LA test, the antisera to three different serovars (1a, 2 and 5) of E. rhusiopathiae reacted with P64-sensitized latex beads, while the antiserum to serovar 20 (2553 strain) did not. Moreover, the antisera to other species of bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus suis, Rhodococcus equi and Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis) did not in this test. Comparing the results of the growth agglutination (GA), ELISA and LA tests of 284 swine sera, there was a high degree of correlation among the results. The detection of anti-E. rhusiopathiae antibodies in the GA, ELISA and LA tests were compared using sera from pigs immunized with P64, alkaline extract (AE) and live-cell vaccine (LV). In all three tests, anti-E. rhusiopathiae antibodies could be detected 1 week after immunization. The serum antibody titre as determined by the LA test increased moderately, as did that by the GA test, while that determined by ELISA increased rapidly. These results suggested that ELISA could be used to monitor changes in anti-E. rhusiopathiae antibody titre and the LA test could be used in the screening test for swine erysipelas.
TI  - 16S rDNA sequence variations of some Streptococcus suis serotypes.
AB  - Streptococcus suis 16S rDNA from selected serotypes has been sequenced and compared with the 16S rDNA sequences from serotypes 1 and 2 present in Genbank. After alignment the sequenced serotypes show clusters of variation. Based on these clusters, a limited phylogenetic tree showing the relationships of all of the serotypes was constructed.
TI  - Phylogenetic diversity of Streptococcus suis strains of various serotypes as revealed by 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison.
AB  - The 16S rRNA gene sequences of reference strains of Streptococcus suis serotypes  1-34 and 1/2 were determined. A comparative sequence analysis showed that the degree of sequence similarity between S. suis reference strains ranged from 93.94 to 100%. A dendrogram was constructed from the similarity matrix. Thirty-two strains representing 32 serotypes fell into a major group divided into three clusters. The other strains, S. suis serotypes 32, 33 and 34, were more distant. Biochemical characterization of the six more distant strains, including S. suis serotypes 20, 22, 26, 32, 33 and 34, revealed a profile similar to that of other S. suis serotypes. Comparison of the 16S rRNA gene sequences of S. suis reference strains with sequences of other members of the genus Streptococcus indicated that, with the exception of S. suis serotypes 32, 33 and 34, reference strains did not cluster with any other species in the genus. In conclusion, 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis defined a major group of S. suis reference strains which were very closely related and a higher divergence for S. suis serotypes 32, 33 and 34. However, to date, there is no strong evidence to reclassify strains of these serotypes in another species.
TI  - Streptococcus suis and group B Streptococcus differ in their interactions with murine macrophages.
AB  - Streptococcus suis type 2 and group B Streptococcus type III (GBS) are important  encapsulated bacterial species causing meningitis. In the present study we compared quantitatively the uptake and intracellular survival of S. suis type 2 and GBS type III with murine macrophages in non-opsonic conditions. The role of the capsule of both pathogens was also studied using previously obtained unencapsulated isogenic mutants. Encapsulated S. suis wild-type strain was practically not phagocytosed, while the unencapsulated mutant was easily ingested by macrophages. On the other hand, the well encapsulated GBS strain and its unencapsulated mutant were both phagocytosed in large numbers. Even if S. suis unencapsulated mutant showed a higher uptake rate than the parental strain, this value was always markedly lower than the numbers of ingested GBS strains. In addition, the intracellular survival of encapsulated and unencapsulated GBS strains was significantly higher than that of S. suis strains. These results suggest that interactions between GBS type III and S. suis type 2 with murine macrophages as well as the role of the capsule as an antiphagocytic factor are different for the two bacterial pathogens.

The new enzymes are isoschizomers of the prototypes as follows: AsuHPI - HphI; AsuSAI - SauI; AsuNHI - NheI; AsuMBI and SmiMBI - MboI; SmiI - rare-cutter SwaI.
TI  - Serological characterization and antimicrobial susceptibility of Streptococcus suis isolates from diagnostic samples in Denmark during 1995 and 1996.
AB  - At the Danish Veterinary Laboratory Streptococcus suis infections in pigs were diagnosed in 114 cases in 1995 and in 151 cases in 1996. Isolates were serotyped using specific antisera against type 1 through 28 and a total of 67 cases from 1995 and 113 cases in 1996 were tested for resistance to 11 antimicrobial agents. The majority of cases were lung diseases (57%), followed by septicaemia (16%), meningitis (15%) and endocarditis (8%). Almost 96% of the isolates could be typed using the 28 antisera. The most common serotype was serotype 2 (29%), followed by serotype 7 (17%), and serotypes 3, 4 and 8 (9-10%). The remaining serotypes were observed in frequencies of less than 5%. Serotype 7 was more commonly isolated from septicaemia than the other serotypes. Serotype 2 was more commonly isolated from pigs older than 4 weeks compared to the other serotypes. Most isolates were susceptible to amoxycillin + clavulanate, ampicillin, ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, penicillin, spectinomycin, tiamulin and trimethoprim + sulphadiazine. A high frequency (> 30%) of resistance to tetracycline was observed. Among isolates of serotype 2, 9.7% were resistant to lincomycin and 12.9% to spiramycin. Among other serotypes 56.8% were resistant to lincomycin and spiramycin. The differences in susceptibility between isolates of serotype 2 and the other serotypes were statistically significant. Compared to a previous Danish study the distribution of serotypes of S. suis causing infections among pigs in Denmark has changed during the last 15 years.
TI  - Immunochemical characterization of an IgG-binding protein of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Several bacterial species express surface proteins with affinity for the constant region (Fc) of immunoglobulin (Ig) of different animal species. Previous studies from our group have reported the presence of an IgG-binding protein in various serotypes of Streptococcus suis. This molecule was also shown to bind in a non-immune fashion chicken IgY and to our knowledge this characteristic is unique. In the present study, by dot-blotting, we showed that the native protein, obtained by affinity chromatography, reacted more strongly with IgG from various animal species than the denatured material. Using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay the affinity of the native 60-kDa protein (previously identified as a 52-kDa protein) towards IgG of various animal species was compared to pig IgG. Bovine, goat and human IgG were able to compete effectively with pig IgG whereas chicken IgY constituted a poor competitor. Peptide mapping analysis using denatured protein indicated that pig and bovine IgG recognized the same proteolytic fragment whereas chicken IgY did not. The smallest proteolytic fragment that retained the binding activity towards the IgG of the different animal species tested had a molecular mass of approximately 40 kDa. Fragments with Mr < 40 kDa showed specific binding activities. That is, the smallest fragment binding pig and bovine IgG had a Mr of 30 kDa whereas for goat and human IgG a fragment of less than 16 kDa still showed binding activity. Finally, we observed that antisera raised against a heat-shock protein of Pseudomonas aeruginosa reacted with the 60-kDa S. suis protein indicating that the S. suis 60-kDa protein is a member of the 60-kDa hsp family that possesses the characteristic of binding in a non-immune way mammalian IgG and chicken IgY.
TI  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 mutants deficient in capsular expression.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is responsible for a wide variety of porcine infections. In addition, it is considered a zoonotic agent. Knowledge about the virulence factors for this bacterium is limited but its polysaccharide capsule is thought to be one of the most important. Transposon mutagenesis with the self-conjugative transposon Tn916 was used to obtain acapsular mutants from the virulent S. suis type 2 reference strain S735. Clones were screened by colony-dot ELISA with a monoclonal antibody specific for a type 2 capsular epitope and clones that failed to react with the antibody were characterized. Two mutants, 2A and 79, having one and two Tn916 insertions respectively, were chosen for further characterization. Absence of capsule was confirmed by coagglutination, capillary precipitation and capsular reaction tests and by transmission electron microscopy. Absence of capsular polysaccharides correlated with increased hydrophobicity and phagocytosis by both murine macrophages and porcine monocytes compared to the wild-type strain. Furthermore, both mutants were shown to be avirulent in murine and pig models of infection. Finally, mutant 2A was readily eliminated from circulation in mice compared to the wild-type strain, which persisted more than 48 h in blood. Thus, isogenic mutants defective in capsule production demonstrate the importance of capsular polysaccharides as a virulence factor for S. suis type 2.
TI  - Identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  - We have used a PCR assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (sodA(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (S. acidominimus, S. agalactiae, S. alactolyticus, S. anginosus, S. bovis, S. constellatus, S. canis, S. cricetus, S. downei, S. dysgalactiae, S. equi subsp. equi, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, S. equinus, S. gordonii, S. iniae, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguis, S. pneumoniae, S. porcinus, S. pyogenes, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. sobrinus, S. suis, S. thermophilus, and S. vestibularis). Phylogenetic analysis of these sodA(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16S rRNA sequences. We have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their sodA(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the sodA(int) fragments of the type species. We propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.
TI  - Use of ribotyping and hemolysin activity to identify highly virulent Streptococcus suis type 2 isolates.
AB  - Nineteen Streptococcus suis type 2 isolates were evaluated for their virulence in pigs and mice. Of these, seven were determined to be highly virulent in pigs on the basis of clinical sign scores and gross pathology and histopathology results. Clinical sign scores correlated with gross pathology and histopathology scores at P equal to 0.004 and P equal to 0.009, respectively. The virulence of highly virulent isolates in pigs compared somewhat with virulence in mice, but the correlation was not significant. No correlation of virulence was noted among the moderately virulent and avirulent isolates in pigs and mice. Chromosomal DNAs from all S. suis isolates were evaluated by PstI, PvuII, EcoRI, and HaeIII restriction enzyme digestion followed by hybridization with a digoxigenin-11-dUTP-labeled cDNA probe transcribed from 16S and 23S rRNAs from Escherichia coli. The hybridization patterns (ribotypes) varied depending upon the enzyme used, but a significant number of isolates determined to be highly virulent in pigs had unique hybridization patterns compared with those of the moderately virulent and avirulent isolates (P = 0.002). In addition, hemolysin activity showed a high correlation to virulence (P = 0.00008) and ribotype (P = 0.002).
TI  - [Meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis type 2 in an adult].
AB  - HISTORY AND ADMISSION FINDINGS: A 54-year-old huntsman who 3 days previously had  shot a wild pig, developed severe headache, nausea and vomiting over the last 10 hours. Physical examination was unremarkable except for an 8 x 4 cm large reddening of the skin over the right tibia and fever (38.2 degrees C). INVESTIGATIONS: Cranial computed tomography was normal. Cerebrospinal fluid showed pleocytosis (5.200 cells/mm3). Gram-stained (CSF) smear showed gram-positive cocci and an increased white cell count (14,000/microliters) was found in blood. DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT AND COURSE: After the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis had been made antibiotics were given intravenously (penicillin G 10 mill. IU, three times daily on days 1 to 16: at first with cefotaxim, three times daily 2 g on days 1 to 3, then with gentamicin twice 80 mg on days 3 to 13). The acute neurological signs quickly regressed, the pretibial reddening (presumably at the port of entry) disappeared, as did the fever on the 4th day of the illness. The streptococci isolated from CSF and blood were identified as 5. suis type 2 (Lancefield group R). But despite the early and effective antibiotic treatment cochleovestibular symptoms (hearing impairment, vertigo and unsteady gait) set in after initial improvement, a frequent complication of S. suis meningitis. CONCLUSION: S. suis should be considered as the causative organism of generalized septicaemia and meningitis in adults, if the history reveals contact with domestic or wild pigs and there are early cochleovestibular signs.
TI  - Virulence of Streptococcus suis type 2 for mice and pigs appeared host-specific.
AB  - A murine model for Streptococcus suis infection in pigs was validated by inoculating groups of 5 BALB/c and 5 CF1 mice with 10(7) CFU/ml of 13 different S. suis serotype 2 strains. The pathogenicity of these strains had been established in a standardized pig model of S. suis infection using one-week-old gnotobiotic pigs. We inoculated groups of mice intraperitoneally with 4 strains that were highly virulent for pigs and belonged to the phenotype MRP+EF+, with 4 strains, that were weakly virulent for pigs and belonged to the phenotype MRP+EF+, and with 5 strains that were non-virulent for pigs and belonged to phenotype MRP-EF-. The S. suis strains that were highly virulent for pigs caused high morbidity and an intermediate mortality in mice, the S. suis strains that were weakly virulent for pigs caused high morbidity but low mortality, and the strains that were non-virulent for pigs, induced highest morbidity and mortality. These results were comparable in both breeds of mice. In contrast to the pathology of S. suis infection in pigs with specific lesions, lesions in mice were histologically often characterized as non-specific, i.e., necrotizing encephalitis and focal or diffuse hepatitis sometimes with abscesses. Irrespective of breed (BALB/c vs. CF1), the murine model used for S. suis infection was incompatible with the pig model. This indicates that virulence of S. suis type 2 for mice and pigs is host-specific. Therefore, we regard the presently available murine models unsuitable for studying S. suis infections in pigs.
TI  - Production of virulence-related proteins by Canadian strains of Streptococcus suis capsular type 2.
AB  - The production of muramidase-released protein (MRP), extracellular protein factor (EF) and hemolysin (suilysin) by 101 Canadian field strains of Streptococcus suis capsular type 2 is described. Most strains (72%) isolated from diseased pigs were MRP-EF- and only 1 strain was MRP+EF+. This strain was also the only 1 to produce the hemolysin. Thirteen strains (15%) were MRP+ EF- and only 3 strains were MRP* EF-. All the strains isolated from clinically healthy pigs as well as a bovine and 2 human isolates had a MRP-EF- phenotype. In addition, 7 strains (8%) had a MRPS phenotype, which had so far been described for S. suis capsular type 1. In conclusion, most Canadian field isolates of S. suis capsular type 2 tested in this study do not produce the virulence-related proteins described so far for this bacterial pathogen.
TI  - Pathogenesis and clinical signs of equine herpesvirus-1 in experimentally infected ponies in vivo.
AB  - Equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) causes respiratory disease, neonatal death, abortion and neurologic disease. The main purpose of this study was to identify viral antigen in respiratory tract samples by immunoperoxidase staining. Six pony foals were selected on the basis of demonstrating seronegativity to EHV-1 by virus neutralization and housed in isolation. They were infected experimentally by administering EHV-1 nebulized ultrasonically through a face mask. Successful infection was clinically apparent as each of the foals had febrile responses, nasal discharge, and enlarged submandibular lymph nodes. Sporadic coughing was also heard. EHV-1 was isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs of 4/6 ponies and seroconversion was demonstrated in all foals. Bronchoscopic examination of the large airways revealed hyperemia. The incidence of recovery of Actinobacillus suis from nasopharyngeal swabs increased initially, with recovery of Streptococcus zooepidemicus isolates predominating at 3 wk post-infection. Cytology brushes were used to sequentially sample the respiratory tract of the infected ponies at the nasopharynx, mid-trachea and the mainstem bronchus. Bronchoalveolar lavage provided lung cells. Immunocytochemistry techniques were applied to both types of samples to locate EHV-1 antigen. Indirect immunoperoxidase staining of samples utilizing monoclonal antibodies specific for EHV-1 demonstrated viral antigen associated with cellular debris, primarily in the nasopharyngeal samples on days 3-9 post-infection.
TI  - Colonization of suckling pigs by Streptococcus suis with particular reference to  pathogenic serotype 2 strains.
AB  - Three swine commercial farms with high mortality rates in nursery pigs due to Streptococcus suis serotype 2 were studied. Brain samples from diseased animals were collected for a period of 6 to 10 mo and used to isolate the strain that was responsible for the mortality (virulent strain) in each farm. Tonsil swabs from piglets at 5, 10 and 15 d were taken to assess both total colonization and colonization by the virulent strain. The effect of sow vaccination against S. suis on colonization was evaluated in 1 of the farms. All suspect tonsil isolates were identified biochemically and then tested against serotype 2. The genomic patterns of serotype 2 isolates were compared to that of the virulent strain using Rep-PCR. Results showed that total colonization by S. suis occurred very early in the pigs' life, with most animals being colonized by weaning age. Prevalence of colonization by serotype 2 strains was much lower than total colonization. After comparing serotype 2 isolates with the virulent strains, only 1 tonsillar isolate had the same genomic pattern as the virulent strain and it belonged to a 4-week-old weaned pig. The genomic pattern of the virulent strain was not found in any tonsillar isolate from 15-day-old or younger pigs. Although limited by sample size, sow vaccination against S. suis increased total colonization at the same time significantly decreasing colonization by serotype 2 strains. Even though most pigs are colonized early in age by S. suis, colonization by the virulent strain is of low prevalence and delayed in time. This could constitute a risk factor for developing the disease later in time, because animals would be colonized when maternal immunity is no longer present, allowing the organism to become systemic.
TI  - Characterization and protective activity of a monoclonal antibody against a capsular epitope shared by Streptococcus suis serotypes 1, 2 and 1/2.
AB  - A monoclonal antibody (mAb Z3) was produced using BALB/c mice immunized with whole cells of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 reference strain S735. Screening by dot-ELISA showed that mAb Z3, of isotype IgG2b, reacted only with reference strains and field isolates of S. suis serotypes 1, 2 and 1/2. The recognized epitope was demonstrated to be polysaccharide in nature by periodate oxidation, and located in the capsule, since mAb Z3 reacted with purified capsular material by immunoblotting and was able to stabilize the capsule as shown by electron microscopy. Further characterization indicated that mAb Z3 may react specifically with the sialic acid moiety of the capsule, a common constituent of the polysaccharidic capsular material of the three capsular types, since sialidase-treated cells did not react with mAb Z3 in immunoblotting or indirect ELISA. Purified mAb Z3 was shown to significantly increase the rate of phagocytosis of S. suis cells by porcine monocytes and to activate the clearance of bacteria from the circulation in experimentally infected mice. However, mAb Z3 only offered partial protection to mice challenged with a minimal lethal dose. Thus, even though the capsule of S. suis seems to be an important virulence factor, the epitope recognized by mAb Z3 does not appear to be involved in complete protection against infection.
TI  - Immunization of pigs against Streptococcus suis serotype 2 infection using a live avirulent strain.
AB  - Streptococcus suis capsular type 2 is still an important cause of economic losses in the swine industry. At the present time, vaccination of pigs against this infection is generally carried out with autogenous bacterins and results are equivocal. In this study, the protective effect of a live avirulent S. suis type 2 strain (#1330) which had induced a good protection in mice, was evaluated in swine. The experiment was performed in triplicate using 4 week-old piglets. A total of 15 piglets were vaccinated 3 times, 15 others were vaccinated 2 times, and 15 piglets were injected 3 times with sterile Todd-Hewitt broth. Using an indirect ELISA, an increase in the IgG response to S. suis antigens was noted in 27 of the 30 vaccinated piglets. On day 21 post-vaccination, all animals were challenged intravenously with a virulent S. suis type 2 strain (#999). In the 2 vaccinated groups, 26 animals were fully protected. Only 1 out of the 15 piglets vaccinated 3 times developed mild clinical signs. In the group vaccinated twice, 3 piglets showed clinical signs and 1 of them died after the challenge. In the control group, 7 animals died out of the 11 with clinical signs of infection. In conclusion, a protective immunity was observed in swine when using strain 1330. However, more studies are needed to assess the use of a live S. suis strain in a vaccine for pigs.
TI  - Cleavage of influenza A virus H1 hemagglutinin by swine respiratory bacterial proteases.
AB  - Cleavage of influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) is required for expression of fusion activity and virus entry into cells. Extracellular proteases are responsible for the proteolytic cleavage activation of avirulent avian and mammalian influenza viruses and contribute to pathogenicity and tissue tropism. The relative contributions of host and microbial proteases to cleavage activation in natural infection remain to be established. We examined 23 respiratory bacterial pathogens and 150 aerobic bacterial isolates cultured from the nasal cavities of pigs for proteolytic activity. No evidence of secreted proteases was found for the bacterial pathogens, including Haemophilus parasuis, Pasteurella multocida, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Bordetella bronchiseptica, and Streptococcus suis. Proteolytic bacteria were isolated from 7 of 11 swine nasal samples and included Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus hyicus, Aeromonas caviae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Enterococcus sp. Only P. aeruginosa secreted a protease, elastase, that cleaved influenza virus HA. However, compared to trypsin, the site of cleavage by elastase was shifted one amino acid in the carboxy-terminal direction and resulted in inactivation of the virus. Under the conditions of this study, we identified several bacterial isolates from the respiratory tracts of pigs that secrete proteases in vitro. However, none of these proteolytic isolates demonstrated direct cleavage activation of influenza virus HA.
TI  - Identification of a Streptococcus suis 60-kDa heat-shock protein using western blotting.
AB  - This study was initiated to investigate the presence of stress or heat shock proteins in Streptococcus suis. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies directed against different bacterial heat shock proteins demonstrated cross-reactivity with a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 60 kDa in all S. suis serotypes tested. The 60-kDa cross-reactive protein was present in virulent and avirulent strains of S. suis serotype 2 tested. A rabbit antiserum raised against the 60-kDa S. suis protein recognized the 60-65-kDa heat shock proteins in different Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Finally, the 60-kDa heat shock protein of S. suis was shown to be mostly secreted into the culture supernatant and, to a lesser extent, cell-associated. Growth under heat stress conditions (42 degrees C) increased the expression of the 60-kDa S. suis protein. This protein is, to our knowledge, the first common antigen found in different serotypes of S. suis.
TI  - Vaccinator device for delivering propellant-driven aerosols of Streptococcus suis bacterin into the respiratory tracts of swine.
AB  - Metered-dose propellant-driven small particle aerosols of a killed whole bacterium, Streptococcus suis, were produced and characterized for their aerodynamic particle sizes and antigenicity as potential respiratory mucosal vaccines against S. suis infections in swine. To facilitate the efficient delivery of such vaccine aerosols to large animals, an electro-mechanical device was developed to synchronize aerosol release to an animal's inhalation cycles. The device was tested for its capacity to deliver a fluorescein conjugate of this bacterin (FITC-S. suis) into the respiratory tracts of 18 pigs. Results showed that FITC-S. suis could be detected in the lungs of swine as small as 4.5 kg with as few as two aerosol actuations. Metered-dose propellant-driven aerosols of bacterin vaccines delivered by this respiratory vaccinating device are discussed as a new approach for stimulated mucosal immunity against respiratory infections in animals.
TI  - Streptococcus suis: past and present.
AB  - Steptococcus suis is a Gram-positive, facultatively anaerobic coccus that has been implicated as the cause of a wide range of clinical disease syndromes in swine and other domestic animals. In swine, the disease has spread worldwide but is more prevalent in countries with intensive swine management practices. The disease syndromes caused by S. suis in swine include arthritis, meningitis, pneumonia, septicaemia, endocarditis, polyserositis, abortions and abscesses. S. suis has also been implicated in disease in humans, especially among abattoir workers and swine and pork handlers. In humans, S. suis type 2 can cause meningitis, which may result in permanent hearing loss, septicaemia, endocarditis and death. The pathogenic mechanism of S. suis is not well defined. Several virulence factors have been identified, but their roles in pathogenesis and disease have not been well elucidated. Much work is in progress on characterization of virulence factors and mechanisms, with emphasis on the control of the disease. Because of the non-availability of suitable immunoprophylaxis, control of S. suis infection has depended mainly on the use of antimicrobials.
TI  - Microbiology and pathology of fibrinous pericarditis in Danish slaughter pigs.
AB  - The prevalence of fibrinous pericarditis detected at slaughter in Danish slaughter pigs is approximately 0.02%. The microbiology and pathology of this disorder was studied through 46 field cases collected at slaughter from May 1994 to August 1995. Mycoplasmas (Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, M. hyosynoviae and M. hyorhinis) were isolated from the pericardium in 38 cases and from the joints in six. M. Hyopneumoniae dominated with 33 isolates from the pericardium. Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae was isolated from the pericardium in three cases (as mono-infection in one and together with M. hyopneumoniae in two cases) and Actinomyces pyogenes was isolated from the pericardium twice (as mono-infection in one case and together with M. hyopneumoniae in another). A. pyogenes was also present in the lung, liver and kidney in one of these cases. Streptococcus suis was isolated together with mycoplasmas from the pericardium in three cases. The pericardium was sterile in three cases and contained a low grade mixed flora in two; the latter is believed to be a result of the slaughter procedure rather than an infection. No chlamydiae were found in connection with the microbiological examination. Parvovirus was found in one case in the pericardium and in two cases in the spleen. Forty-five cases were subacute to chronic. The gross pathological examination showed that bronchopneumonia, chronic pleuritis and synovitis or a low grade arthritis occurred in most cases. Only the arthritic lesions are believed to be pathogenetically concurrent with the pericarditis. Slight evidence of stasis of the liver and/or periangiolar edema was present in six cases. The histopathological examination confirmed the above mentioned findings. Bacterial colonies were found within the fibrinous layer on the pericardium in all cases from which either A. pleuropneumoniae, A. pyogenes or S. suis was isolated. It is concluded that in this study mycoplasmas, particularly M. Hyopneumoniae, are the more likely cause of fibrinous pericarditis in slaughter pigs.
TI  - Acute hemorrhagic pulmonary infarction and necrotizing pneumonia in horses: 21 cases (1967-1993).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize history, clinical signs, and pathologic findings in horses with histologically confirmed acute hemorrhagic pulmonary infarction and necrotizing pneumonia. DESIGN: Retrospective study. ANIMALS: 21 horses. RESULTS: 19 of the 21 horses were Thoroughbred racehorses in training. Eighteen horses had had strenuous exercise immediately prior to onset of illness. Fifteen horses had a serosanguineous nasal discharge during hospitalization. Seventeen horses had radiographic evidence of pulmonary consolidation and pleural effusion. Nine of 14 horses had ultrasonographic evidence of large pulmonary parenchymal defects consistent with consolidation. Pleurocentesis yielded a suppurative, serosanguineous effusion in the 14 horses in which it was performed. Bacteria were isolated from all transtracheal aspirates (14) and from 6 of 12 pleural fluid samples. Actinobacillus suis-like organisms and Streptococcus equi subsp zooepidemicus were most commonly isolated. Nineteen horses were hospitalized and treated. Mean duration of treatment was 5 days, and most horses were euthanatized because of secondary complications, continued costs of medical treatment, or poor prognosis for future performance. Pathologic lesions included well-demarcated regions of hemorrhagic pulmonary infarction with necrosis and a serosanguineous pleural effusion. Thrombosis of pulmonary vessels was found in 11 horses. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: An acute or peracute onset of severe respiratory distress, with serosanguineous nasal discharge, ultrasonographic and radiographic evidence of severe pulmonary consolidation, and serosanguineous suppurative pleural effusion, is strongly suggestive of pulmonary infarction in horses. Horses with pulmonary infarction responded poorly to conventional treatment for pleuropneumonia and had a poor prognosis for recovery.
TI  - Demonstration of vertical transmission of Streptococcus suis in swine by genomic  fingerprinting.
AB  - Isolates of Streptococcus suis serotype 5 collected from three sows and nine of their pigs at birth were analyzed by genomic DNA fingerprinting. The cleavage patterns of DNA from S. suis isolated from the sows matched the cleavage patterns of DNA from S. suis isolated from their respective pigs.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of a dextranase gene (dexS) from Streptococcus suis.
AB  - A gene (dexS) coding for a Streptococcus suis capsular type 2 dextranase (DexS) was detected in a recombinant gene library constructed in phage lambda ZapII, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. Sequence comparison showed that the dexS gene product had significant similarities with enzymes which hydrolyze glucose polymers. Moreover, conserved amino acids that are suggested to be part of the active site of the glucosidases are also found in DexS. The dexS gene, adjacent to the gene encoding a S. suis IgG-binding protein, encoded a protein of approximately 62 kDa which exhibited DexS activity.

TI  - Virulent strains of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 and highly virulent strains of  Streptococcus suis serotype 1 can be recognized by a unique ribotype profile.
AB  - The ribotype profiles of 42 different Streptococcus suis strains were studied. These strains belonged to five serotypes and differed in their virulence for pigs as well as in the expression of the muramidase-released protein and the extracellular protein factor. For the ribotyping, chromosomal DNAs were digested with EcoRI and were hybridized with a 1,066-bp ribosomal DNA probe. The hybridization patterns showed genetic heterogeneity within and between the serotypes. Pathogenic strains of serotype 2 and highly pathogenic strains of serotype 1 could be recognized by their unique ribotype profiles. Nonpathogenic strains showed a high degree of genetic heterogeneity. Moreover, by comparing the 16S ribosomal DNA sequences of a number of S. suis strains, we were able to design two DNA probes which specifically hybridized with S. suis strains.
TI  - General overview of PRRSV: a perspective from the United States.
AB  - Four years after the report of its discovery, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) continues to challenge swine producers, veterinary practitioners, and animal health researchers in the United States. The prevalence of infection is high--60% to 80% of herds is a reasonable estimate--but the clinical effects of infection vary widely among farms. In many herds, infection is unapparent and productivity seemingly unaffected. Some infected herds report occasional respiratory disease outbreaks in young pigs, or periodic outbreaks of reproductive disease, and a few herds experience severe, chronic disease problems, particularly in young pigs. In these herds, secondary infections with viral or bacterial pathogens, particularly Salmonella choleraesuis, Streptococcus suis, or Haemophilus parasuis typically occur concurrently with PRRSV infections. Understanding why some herds undergo devastating episodes of clinical disease and others show no apparent effects is central to solving the problem of clinical PRRS for swine producers. Understanding the ecology and epidemiology of PRRSV is the key to preventing and controlling PRRSV in the future. The objective of this article is to review recent developments in these areas.
TI  - [Vitamin E as a possible aid in the control of disease problems on pig farms: a field test].
AB  - In two sow-herds problems with weaning-diarrhoea and Streptococcus suis meningitis were successfully controlled by strategic use of antibiotics during the post-weaning period. In an attempt to reduce the intake of antibiotics by farm animals, the vitamin E level in the post-weaning diet was increased from 20 IE/kg to 80 IE/kg, because vitamin E is thought to increase resistance. The effect on both farms was stunning, so a small field trial was started. In this trial the higher level of vitamin E had a statistically significant beneficial effect on weaning-diarrhoea. The author concludes that in some cases an increased level of vitamin E can have a positive effect on disease management on pig-farms and can lead to reduced use of antibiotics.
TI  - Streptococcus suis infection complicated by purpura fulminans and rhabdomyolysis: case report and review.
AB  - Streptococcus suis infection, an important zoonotic occupational disease in humans, is associated with meningitis, arthritis, and perceptive deafness. We report a case of severe S. suis infection in a previously healthy man who developed purpura fulminans and rhabdomyolysis, complications not previously reported with this disease.
TI  - Description of an albumin binding activity for Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - This study was undertaken to investigate the binding activity of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 to albumin. Using flow cytometry we observed a binding activity of S. suis to albumin for virulent as well as for avirulent isolates. Western immunoblots analysis revealed that a 39-kDa S. suis protein was responsible, at least in part, for this binding activity. This protein showed high N-terminal homology (95.6% for the first 23 residues) with a group A Streptococcus glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Furthermore, the addition of albumin to the culture broth resulted in an increase in the virulence of S. suis strains in mice. These results suggest that an interaction with albumin could play a role in the pathogenesis of S. suis serotype 2 infections.

TI  - Effect of different diets on oral bacteria and caries activity in Sprague-Dawley  rats.
AB  - The conventional rat model of dental caries has been used extensively to measure  the contribution of various inoculated bacteria or diets to dental caries production. Only limited information is available on the effect of different diets on the oral bacterial community as a whole. In the present study, using selective and non-selective media, the oral bacterial populations of 21-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats fed diets with commercial rat and mouse cubes (control), high-starch (56%) and sucrose (56%) diets for 21 days were investigated. The high-starch diet did not significantly change the proportion of oral bacteria compared with the control group; the high-sucrose diet significantly enhanced the total cultivable bacteria, particularly Actinomyces naeslundii, Streptococcus rattus and Streptococcus suis-like bacteria. The order of diets with respect to the production of dental caries was sucrose > starch > normal. Thus the high-sucrose diet changed the oral bacterial population of Sprague-Dawley rats and these changes were reflected in the increased level of dental caries.

TI  - Streptococcus suis toxic-shock syndrome and meningitis.
AB  - Three cases with S. suis bacteremia and meningitis were reported. The first case  was a 23-year-old butcher who was a regular drinker of alcohol for two years and developed streptococcal toxic-shock syndrome. The organism was transmitted to him through a minor cut in his right arm. The second cases was a 49-year-old female laborer who had been consuming locally produced alcohol for 20 years and developed fever and meningitis. Unfortunately, she succumbed in seven days despite intensive supportive and cefotaxime treatments. The third case was a 45-year-old regular alcoholic drinker and car painter who was seen at a private hospital due to contusion at his left lateral chest wall. However, fever and confusion due to meningitis was detected upon admission. Irreversible deafness developed within 48 hours of ceftriaxone therapy for meningitis. He finally recovered with deafness. S. suis was isolated from blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures in all three cases though initially reported to be viridans group of streptococci.
TI  - Bacterial isolation from slaughtered pigs associated with endocarditis, especially the isolation of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Bacterial isolation from slaughtered pigs with endocarditis was carried out from  1985 to 1994. A total of 495 (0.025%) out of 2,006,127 pigs were diagnosed as having endocarditis. Though bacteria were significantly isolated from 399 of the 495 pigs, bacteria could not be isolated in 96 pigs (19.4%). In 11 pigs, 2 bacterial species were isolated from heart lesion. Streptococcus suis was isolated from 127 cases (25.7%), Streptococcus dysgalactiae from 75 (15.2%), Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae from 63 (12.7%), Actinomyces pyogenes from 39 (7.9%), Pasteurella multocida from 11 (2.2%). Staphylococcus aureus from 10 (2.0%), and Streptococcus porcinus from 8 (1.6%). Among the 99 isolates biochemically identified as S. suis, the major serotype was S. suis type 2 (35.4%). The remainder of the typable isolates were identified as serotypes 1/2 (2.0%) and 9 (1.0%). A total of 61 isolates (61.6%) were untypable.

TI  - Species selectivity of new siderophore-drug conjugates that use specific iron uptake for entry into bacteria.
AB  - Siderophores selectively bind ferric iron and are involved in receptor-specific iron transport into bacteria. Several types of siderophores were synthesized, and growth-promoting or inhibitory activities when they were conjugated to carbacephalosporin, erythromycylamine, or nalidixic acid were investigated. Overall, 11 types of siderophores and 21 drug conjugates were tested against seven different bacterial species: Escherichia coli, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella haemolytica, Streptococcus suis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. In some species, the inhibitory activities of the drug conjugates were associated with the ability of the bacteria to use the siderophore portion of the molecules for growth promotion in disc diffusion tests (0.04 mumol of conjugate or siderophore per disc). E. coli used catechol-based siderophore portions as well as hydroxamate-based tri-delta-OH-N-OH-delta-N-acetyl-L-ornithine ferric iron ligands for growth under iron-restricted conditions achieved by supplemental ethylenediamine di (O-hydroxyphenylacetic acid) (100 micrograms/ml) and was sensitive to carbacephalosporin conjugated to these siderophore types (up to a 34-mm-diameter inhibition zone). B. bronchiseptica used desferrioxamine B and an isocyanurate-based or trihydroxamate in addition to catechol-based siderophore portions for promotion but was not inhibited by beta-lactam conjugates partly because of the presence of beta-lactamase. P. multocida and P. haemolytica did not use any of the synthetic siderophores for growth promotion, and the inhibitory activities of some conjugates seemed partly linked to their ability to withhold iron from these bacteria, since individual siderophore portions showed some antibacterial effects. Individual siderophores did not promote S. suis growth in restrictive conditions, but the type of ferric iron ligands attached to beta-lactams affected inhibitory activities. The antibacterial activities of the intracellular-acting agents erythromycylamine and nalidixic acid were reduced or lost, even against S. aureus and S. epidermidis, when the agents were conjugated to siderophores. Conjugate-resistant E. coli mutants showed the absence of some iron-regulated outer membrane proteins in gel electrophoresis profiles and in specific phage or colicin sensitivity tests, implying that the drugs used outer membrane receptors of ferric complexes to get into cells.

TI  - Interpretive criteria for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of ceftiofur against bacteria associated with swine respiratory disease.
AB  - Ceftiofur, an extended-spectrum cephalosporin, is active against a variety of animal pathogens, including organisms associated with swine respiratory disease. However, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoint and disk diffusion interpretive criteria have not been established for swine pathogens. Susceptibility tests were performed by broth microdilution MIC and disk diffusion methods on 246 bacterial species that cause swine respiratory disease. Ceftiofur was active against Salmonella sp., Pasteurella multocida, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Streptococcus suis, and Escherichia coli but was not active against Bordetella bronchiseptica measured by MIC. Based on pharmacokinetic studies of ceftiofur in swine after a single intramuscular injection of 3 or 5 mg/kg body weight of ceftiofur and on the MIC and disk diffusion data, we recommend MIC breakpoints and disk diffusion distances, respectively, of < or = 2 micrograms/ml and > or = 21 mm for susceptible, 4 micrograms/ml and 18-20 mm for intermediate, and > or = 8 micrograms/ml and > or = 17 mm for resistant classification for swine pathogens. When these breakpoints were applied to data from a previous study using bovine pathogens, only 1 minor interpretive error occurred.
TI  - Mutants of Streptococcus suis types 1 and 2 impaired in expression of muramidase-released protein and extracellular protein induce disease in newborn germfree pigs.
AB  - The contribution of muramidase-released protein (MRP) and extracellular factor (EF) to the virulence of Streptococcus suis type 1 and 2 infections was studied. For that aim, we constructed mutants of S. suis types 1 and 2 by inactivating the genes encoding MRP and EF. Moreover, we changed a type 2 strain producing the 110-kDa EF protein into a strain producing a modified protein (EF*) of increased molecular mass. The chromosomally located mrp and epf genes were inactivated by replacement recombination by using nonreplicative plasmids. Newborn germfree pigs were inoculated with pathogenic type 1 and 2 strains and with the isogenic mutant strains. Wild-type as well as mutant strains induced fever, specific signs of disease, and lesions. Moreover, all mutant strains could be reisolated from the central nervous system of infected pigs. These results showed that inactivation or alteration of the mrp and epj genes had no measurable effect on the pathogenicity of S. suis types 1 and 2.
TI  - Binding properties of Streptococcus suis for immunoglobulin G and other plasma proteins.
AB  - Immunoglobulin G (IgG) binding proteins on the surface of Streptococcus suis could be readily detected by direct cultivation of the bacteria on nitrocellulose membranes and subsequent treatment of the membranes with human IgG. Among the 75 S. suis isolates tested two cultures (S. suis P43, S. suis P143) caused a blue colouration of the membranes indicating IgG binding activities. The IgG binding proteins could be solubilized by heat treatment of the bacteria at an acid pH and also by mutanolysin treatment. Western blot analysis revealed numerous protein bands with IgG binding activities. The IgG binding proteins were also released into the culture supernatant of the bacteria. This could be detected for 51 of the 75 S. suis using a microfiltration assay. In binding studies with 125I-IgG S. suis P43 and S. suis P143 but none of the other S. suis isolates showed a significant binding of the protein. These two cultures additionally bound 125I-albumin, 125I-alpha 2-macroglobulin and 125I-fibrinogen all from humans but not 125I-chicken IgG or 125I-human haptoglobin 2-1. The binding profiles of the two S. suis cultures tested indicate a close relation of these binding proteins with streptococcal protein G.
TI  - Comparative preparation methods of sialylated capsule antigen from Streptococcus  suis type 2 with type specific antigenicity.
AB  - The capsular polysaccharide (CPS) of Streptococcus (S.) suis type 2 was isolated  from a type strain of S. suis NCTC 10234 by three different preparative methods: (A) lysozyme treatment method, (B) autoclave extraction method, and (C) HCl-extraction method. The structural characteristics of the three CPS (CPS-A, B and C) were examined by gel permeation chromatography, reactivity against rabbit antiserum and proton-nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR). N-Acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc) residues as sialic acid in CPS-C were partially dissociated or degraded during preparation with a remarkable decrease in the molecular mass and the antigen activity. Although both methods A and B produced intact CPS without releasing NeuAc residues, method B was considered to be a more suitable procedure for preparing the CPS antigen because of time-saving and safety factors. Sugar analysis by high performance liquid chromatography and gas liquid chromatography showed that CPS-B consisted of five kinds of sugars: Rhamnose (Rha), Glucose (Glc). Galactose (Gal), N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and NeuAc, in a molar ratio of 1.00:0.95:3.68:0.80:1.31. After complete removal of NeuAc residues by mild acid hydrolysis of CPS-B, the reactivity with anti-type 2 serum was not detected. The NeuAc residue in CPS of S. suis type 2 strain was thought to be the antigen epitope portion.
TI  - Protection of experimentally infected pigs by suilysin, the thiol-activated haemolysin of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Three groups of three pigs were vaccinated either with vaccine VAC-SLY, containing purified suilysin derived from Streptococcus suis strain P1/7 (serotype 2), or with vaccine VAC-SCF, containing most of the other extracellular antigens produced by strain P1/7 (but essentially free from suilysin), or with a placebo vaccine. The pigs were vaccinated twice at four weeks and six weeks of age and were challenged intravenously with S suis strain P1/7 at eight weeks of age. On the day of challenge, only the VAC-SLY vaccinated pigs showed an increase in haemolysin neutralisation titre. After challenge the placebo vaccinated pigs developed severe clinical signs characterised by lameness involving several joints, a depressed appearance, high temperatures and/or neurological signs. The VAC-SCF vaccinated pigs showed the same clinical signs but less severely. The VAC-SLY vaccinated pigs were the least affected and showed only mild signs which subsided more quickly than those of the other groups. A post mortem investigation and histology of brain tissue samples confirmed the clinical findings; fibrinous arthritis was less severe and less frequently observed in the VAC-SLY vaccinated pigs than in the VAC-SCF or placebo vaccinated pigs, and none of the VAC-SLY vaccinated pigs had meningitis whereas two of the VAC-SCF and two of the placebo vaccinated pigs did so. All the samples of brain, lung and tarsus taken from the VAC-SLY vaccinated pigs were sterile whereas S suis was reisolated from most of these tissues from the other groups.
TI  - Streptococcus suis meningitis: First case reported in Quebec.
AB  - Very few Streptococcus suis infections in humans have been reported in Canada, although the condition is frequent in pigs. Meningitis, often accompanied by severe hearing loss, is the most common clinical manifestation. The disease is an occupational illness affecting persons in contact with pigs and may be underdiagnosed because of misidentification of the responsible bacterium. Since Quebec is the leading province for swine production in Canada, physicians and microbiologists should be aware of this infection, especially when a streptococcal meningitis is diagnosed in swine workers. The first case of S suis type 2 meningitis reported in Quebec is described.

TI  - Detection of antibodies against Streptococcus suis capsular type 2 using a purified capsular polysaccharide antigen-based indirect ELISA.
AB  - In the present study a purified capsular polysaccharide antigen-based indirect ELISA (CPS-ELISA) to detect antibodies against Streptococcus suis capsular type 2 was developed and compared with a whole cell antigen-based ELISA (WCA-ELISA). The WCA-ELISA presented a very low specificity when rabbit antisera to other capsular types were tested. Most of these cross-reactions were due to common proteins. The standardized CPS-ELISA gave satisfactory results using a concentration of 0.1 micrograms/well; most cross-reactions decreased significantly, with some exceptions, such as those shared by capsular types 1/2, 12 and 17. These cross-reactions were mainly due to common epitopes present in the capsule, as shown by immunoblotting. In a second experiment, the CPS-ELISA was used to detect antibodies in experimentally infected piglets. Despite the fact that capsular type 2 S. suis could be reisolated from all infected animals during and/or after the trial, antibody titers against a second infection. Sera from piglets experimentally infected were completely protected against a second infection. Sera from piglets experimentally infected with S. suis capsular types 1/2 or 12 presented cross-reactions at low dilutions, confirming data previously obtained with rabbit sera. Finally, sera of animals from herds with clinical signs associated with S. suis capsular type 2 did not present titers significantly different from those of disease free herds. From our results we concluded that the CPS-ELISA developed in this study can not be used as a diagnostic tool to identify infected animals.
TI  - Purification and partial characterization of a novel antibacterial agent (Bac1829) Produced by Staphylococcus aureus KSI1829.
AB  - A novel antimicrobial agent from Staphylococcus aureus KSI1829, designated Bac1829, was purified by sequential steps of ammonium sulfate precipitation, Sephadex G-50 gel filtration chromatography, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Purified Bac1829 has a molecular mass of 6,418 +/- 2 Da. The peptide in heat stable, since full biological activity is retained after heating at 95 degrees C for 15 min, and it is destroyed by digestion with proteases. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed a high concentration of Ala and Gly residues, which respectively comprised 24 and 19% of the total amino acid content. Additionally, high levels of hydrophobic amino acids were present, accounting for the hydrophobic nature of Bac1829. Purified Bac1829 killed exponentially growing Corynebacterium renale in a dose-dependent manner by a bactericidal mode of action. A partial inhibitory spectrum analysis revealed that the following organisms were sensitive to the inhibitory activity of Bac1829: S. aureus RN4220, Streptococcus suis, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, C. renale, Corynebacterium diptheriae, Haemophilus parasuis, Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella bronchoseptica, Moraxella bovis, and Pasteurella multocida.
TI  - The galactosyl-(alpha 1-4)-galactose-binding adhesin of Streptococcus suis: occurrence in strains of different hemagglutination activities and induction of opsonic antibodies.
AB  - The occurrence of the galactose-(alpha 1-4)-galactose-specific adhesin in Streptococcus suis, a pig and human pathogen causing sepsis, meningitis, and other serious infections, was studied. Poly- and monoclonal anti-bodies to the purified adhesin, as well as pigeon ovomucoid, a specific probe for the adhesin activity, detected one single protein band in extracts of S. suis. The adhesin was detected in all 23 strains studied, representing pathogenic serotypes (1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and nontypeable) and including several weakly hemagglutinating or nonhemagglutinating strains and phase variants. The amount of adhesin detected was not correlated with the hemagglutination activity of the intact bacteria. Extraction of cells showing no binding of pigeon ovomucoid by ultrasonic treatment resulted in extracts with pigeon ovomucoid binding activity, suggesting that the adhesin was not accessible to the probe on the intact cells. Analysis of the amount of capsular polysaccharide revealed an inverse relationship between the hemagglutination activity and expression of capsular polysaccharide, thus suggesting a factor influencing adhesin accessibility. The purified adhesin was highly immunogenic and induced in preliminary experiments bactericidal activity in mice. Thus, the adhesin, with its specific binding mechanism to host cells and a proposed pathogenic role, is widely expressed among strains of different serotypes and therefore appears to represent a novel promising candidate for the development of a vaccine against S. suis.
TI  - Role of capsular sialic acid in virulence and resistance to phagocytosis of Streptococcus suis capsular type 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis capsular type 2 has a capsule rich in sialic acid (NANA). Sialic acid, known to be an antiphagocytic factor for many bacterial species, inhibits the activation of the alternative complement pathway. The role of capsular NANA in virulence, resistance to phagocytosis and intracellular survival of S. suis capsular type 2 was evaluated. In general, a low concentration of NANA was observed for all the S. suis strains tested. In addition, no difference could be found in NANA concentrations between strains of different virulence degrees. Sialic acid concentration increased in the virulent strain 89-1591 and the avirulent strain 90-1330 after in vivo growth with an increased capsular material thickness compared to growth in vitro. No significant difference could be found in the phagocytosis rate by porcine blood monocytes of either strain and strain 89-1591 treated with sialidase or the sialic acid-binding lectin from Sambucus nigra (SNA I). Intracellular survival of strain 89-1591 decreased after treatments with sialidase or lectin, becoming comparable to that of strain 90-1330. Finally, no difference could be seen in virulence using a murine model, even if strain 89-1591 was treated with the enzyme or the lectin. Thus, NANA does not seem to be a critical virulence factor for S. suis capsular type 2.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftiofur and its primary metabolite, desfuroylceftiofur, against organisms of veterinary importance.
AB  - Ceftiofur (XNL) and its primary metabolite, desfuroylceftiofur (DXNL), were evaluated for in vitro activity against 539 isolates from veterinary sources. Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Pasteurella spp., Haemophilus somnus, Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli, staphylococci, and streptococci were tested. Overall, XNL and DXNL were equivalent in activity against the gram-negative organisms with all minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) within 1 serial dilution. Against the staphylococci, MIC difference of 2-3 serial dilutions were detected with an MIC90 for XNL and DXNL of 1.0 and 4.0-8.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. Although the MIC90 obtained for Streptococcus suis for each compound was within 1 dilution, the MIC values against individual strains were 2-3 dilutions greater for DXNL than for XNL. The MICs obtained with the bovine and equine streptococci for DXNL (MIC90 = 0.03 microgram/ml) were 5 serial dilutions higher than those obtained for XNL (MIC90 < or = 0.0019). Although DXNL was less active than XNL against the streptococci, these differences were not clinically important because both XNL and DXNL were highly active for these bacteria. Although these differences are of little importance with the streptococci, they may have important implications for susceptibility testing of the staphylococci. In conclusion, with the exception of the staphylococci, both XNL and DXNL were highly active against the organisms tested, with MICs for both compounds several fold lower than plasma levels achieved during dosing of XNL.
TI  - Characterization of virulence of the Streptococcus suis serotype 2 reference strain Henrichsen S 735 in newborn gnotobiotic pigs.
AB  - Strain Henrichsen S 735 (NCTC 10234) of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 reference and three other such strains (strains S 4005, S 3921 and T 141) were tested for virulence by inoculating pigs intranasally and intravenously. The taxonomical properties of each strain were determined. Phenotypes were determined by Western blotting based on MRP and EF protein expression and genotypes were determined by Southern hybridization analysis of the mrp and epf genes. Reference strain S 735 and strain S 3921 produced the 136 kDa MRPh and a 180 kDa form of EF, and hence these strains belong to the MRP + EF phenotype. In accordance with previous experiments with this phenotype, strains S 735 and S 3921 appeared to be only weakly virulent for newborn gnotobiotic pigs. Strain S 4005 produced the 136 kDa MRP and the 110 kDa form of EF, hence it belongs to the MRP + EF + phenotype. This strain was highly virulent for pigs. Strain T 141 did not produce MRP or EF, and hence belongs to the MRP-EF- phenotype. It was nonvirulent for pigs. The route of inoculation did not influence the frequency or severity of clinical signs of disease or lesions, which demonstrated that the 110 kDa EF is not essential during invasion. Southern blot analysis showed that all four S. suis type 2 strains contain sequences that are homologous to the epf and mrp genes. For studies on pathogenesis of S. suis type 2 infections in pigs, we recommend the use of strains that have been tested in a standardized pig model and that belong to the MRP + EF + phenotype, such as strain S 4005.
TI  - Evaluation of a PCR for detection of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae in mixed bacterial cultures from tonsils.
AB  - A PCR for the detection of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae was evaluated. All of  102 field, isolates of A, pleuropneumoniae reacted in the PCR by amplification of a 985 bp product. No PCR amplification product was observed when examining strains of A. ureae, A. capsulatus, A. hominis, A. equuli, A, rossii, A. suis, Escherichia coli, Bordetella bronchiseptica. Streptococcus suis, Pasteurella haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus parasuis, Haemophilus taxon Minor group, Haemophilus taxon D/E and haemophilus taxon F. Amplification of a 985 bp product was, however, observed when testing strains of A. lignieresii. The lower detection limit of the PCR test was 10(3) A. pleuropneumoniae CFU/PCR test tube and was not affected by addition of 10(6) E. coli CFU/PCR test tube. Mixed bacterial cultures from tonsils of 101 pigs from 9 different herds were tested by culture and by PCR using four different bacteriological media. While 65% reacted positive in the PCR only 23% were positive by culture, thereby suggesting a superior sensitivity of the PCR test to that of culture. The use of selective media, large inoculum and incubation for 48 h gave the highest number of positive PCR reactions from mixed bacterial cultures. Tonsil cultures from 50 pigs from an A. pleuropneumoniae-negative herd did not react in the PCR. The results show that PCR on mixed bacterial cultures from tonsils may be a highly sensitive method for the detection of A. pleuropneumoniae in pig herds.
TI  - Enhancement of host resistance to bacterial infections in normal and immunosuppressed mice with Actinobacillus suis.
AB  - A single intraperitoneal (ip) inoculation of heat-killed Actinobacillus suis ATCC 15,557 (AS 15,557) into normal and immunosuppressed (dexamethasone-treated) mice led to remarkable nonspecific resistance to ip challenge with lethal doses of opportunistic pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. The duration of this enhanced protective action and the minimal effective dose, in normal mice, induced by AS 15,557 were superior to those induced by other bacterial immunostimulants such as heat-killed Lavtobacillus casei YIT 9018 (LC 9018) and penicillin-treated Streptococcus pyogenes, Su (OK-432). In immunosuppressed mice; the reduced in vivo killing activity of peritoneal exudate cells (PECs) against P. aeruginosa infection was markedly augmented by ip injection of AS 15,557. The degree of PEC augmentation induced by AS 15,557 was higher than that induced by LC 9018 or by OK-432. The toxicity and histopathological changes associated with AS 15557 were very low, as compared with those by produced by LC 9018 and OK-432. The results suggest that AS 15,557, which showed a strong resistance-enhancing capacity against opportunistic bacterial infections, may be a useful bacterial immunostimulant.
TI  - [Streptococci or slurry pit ventilation?].
AB  - This article describes a case of disturbed behaviour in weaners resulting in mutilation. The mutilations mainly consisted of ear biting and ear necrosis. During some periods all weaners were affected. Deaths occurred as a result of sepsis and meningitis, caused by Streptococcus suis type 1. There were many runts. The stable was as follows: the sections contained 160 weaners; the floor consisted of plastic slats with a 1-metre-deep slurry pit. The weaners were medicated extensively for the Streptococci, to little effect. A ventilation expert was called in and the diagnosis was 'variable air distribution patterns resulting in slurry pit ventilation'. To solve the problem a number of modifications were made to the ventilation system. The solution was found in attaching flaps under the floor, hanging down into the slurry at every pen partition and in the middle across the entire length of each section. In this manner all air circulation in the slurry pit was effectively ended. Thus in conclusion, mutilative behaviour, eg. ear biting and ear necrosis, can be caused by draught. Medication can provide temporary relief, but does not solve the problem. Only ending the air circulation in the slurry pit provided a lasting solution.
TI  - In vitro phagocytosis and survival of Streptococcus suis capsular type 2 inside murine macrophages.
AB  - In this study, data on phagocytosis of Streptococcus suis and its survival inside macrophages are presented. Mouse peritoneal macrophages were incubated in the presence of one of five different strains of S. suis capsular type 2: a virulent wild-type strain (1591), a non-capsulated non-virulent mutant strain (M2), a poorly capsulated non-virulent mutant strain (M42), a non-virulent capsulated strain (1330), and the wild-type reference (virulent) strain S735. Opsonized or non-opsonized bacteria were incubated with macrophages in vitro and samples were obtained after 1 and 3 h incubation. Phagocytosis as well as live and dead intracellular organisms were determined by acridine orange and crystal violet staining. After 1 h incubation, non-opsonized virulent and non-virulent capsulated bacteria were poorly phagocytosed (by less than 7% of the macrophages), whereas the non-capsulated non-virulent mutant strain was highly phagocytosed (by more than 68% of the macrophages). The M42 mutant strain was more phagocytosed than the capsulated strains but less than the non-capsulated M2 mutant strain (35%). In contrast, a higher percentage of live bacteria was observed inside macrophages for the capsulated strains (1591 and S735) than for the non- or poorly capsulated mutant strains (M2 and M42). Opsonization of bacteria with rabbit serum or heat-inactivated rabbit serum significantly increased phagocytosis. For every opsonized strain, after 3 h incubation, the percentage of live bacteria within macrophages was considerably lower than the corresponding non-opsonized strains. In conclusion, the capsule of S. suis type 2 appears to act as an important anti-phagocytic factor. However, virulent capsulated non-opsonized strains can be phagocytosed by mouse peritoneal macrophages within which they appear to survive for at least 3 h. Serum factors other than complement increase not only phagocytosis but also intracellular killing of S. suis of both capsulated and non-capsulated strains.
TI  - Surface location of HPr, a phosphocarrier of the phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system in Streptococcus suis.
AB  - HPr is a low-molecular-mass phosphocarrier protein of the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP): sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) found in the cytoplasm or associated with the inner surface of the cytoplasmic membrane. Treatment of Streptococcus suis cells with a Sorvall Omnimixer, a technique used to extract cell surface components, resulted in the extraction of a major protein with a molecular mass of 9 kDa. Several lines of evidence suggested that this protein was HPr: (i) the S. suis protein showed homology over the first 35 N-terminal amino acid residues with the HPrs of Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus mutans, including the signature sequence for the site of PEP-dependent phosphorylation; (ii) it cross-reacted with the S. salivarius anti-HPr antibody preparation; (iii) it could be phosphorylated by enzyme I at the expense of PEP, and by a membrane-associated kinase at the expense of ATP; and (iv) it possessed phosphocarrier activity when used as a source of HPr in an in vitro PTS assay. The data suggested that a portion of the cellular HPr is associated with the external cell surface in S. suis, a result that was confirmed by immunogold electron microscopy. The cellular HPr of S. suis consisted of two forms that could be distinguished by the presence or the absence of the N-terminal methionine. Amino acid sequence analysis indicated that the cell-surface-associated HPr of S. suis lacked the N-terminal methionine residue.

TI  - An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of antibody against Streptococcus suis type 2 in infected pigs.
AB  - An ELISA test for the detection of antibody against S. suis type 2 in pigs was developed and applied to field sera. The best sensitivity and specificity of ELISA were obtained when a purified polysaccharide antigen was used. It showed no cross reaction with sera against other serotypes of S. suis and other pathogenic bacteria. A total of 264 sera were collected from 20 pig farms and examined with the antibody against S. suis type 2. In the affected farms, 17.0% of pigs tested were positive, 9.8% in the adjacent farms, but only 3.4% in the free farms. The difference of the positive percentages between the affected and the free farms was statistically significant (P < 0.05).
TI  - Susceptibility to antimicrobial agents of Streptococcus suis capsular type 2 strains isolated from pigs.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for thirty-three epidemiologicaly unrelated clinical isolates of Streptococcus suis capsular type 2 were determined in relation to ampicillin, ampicillin-sulbactam, amoxicillin, clavulanate-amoxicillin, penicillin G, cephalexin, gentamicin, streptomycin, erythromycin, tylosin and doxycycline, using the microtitre broth dilution procedure described by the U.S. National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). Gentamicin was the most active compound tested, with an MIC for 90% of the strains tested (MIC(90)) of 0.4 mg/L. Overall, 70% of strains were resistant to doxycycline (MIC(90) > or = 100.0 mg/L), followed by penicillin G (51% of strains) (MIC(90) + or = 100.0 mg/L). Resistance to amoxicillin and ampicillin was 36.4% (MIC(90) 12.5 mg/L) and 33.3% (MIC(90) 50.0 mg/L), respectively. 15.2% of S. suis strains were resistant to streptomycin, tylosin and cephalexin with MIC90 values of 25.0 mg/L, 12.5 mg/L and 25.0 mg/L, respectively. A combination of ampicillin and sulbactam (MIC(90) 6.3 mg/L) and a combination of amoxicillin and clavulanate (MIC(90) 3.1 mg/L) as well as erythromycin (1.6 mg/L) were of the same efficacy, with a total of 9.1% resistant S. suis strains. This high percentage of resistance to doxycycline and penicillin G precludes the use of these antibiotics as empiric therapy of swine diseases.
TI  - Growth and microbial flora of nonmedicated, segregated, early weaned pigs from a  commercial swine operation.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether segregated, early weaned pigs have better growth  performance and different microbial flora than those pigs raised on-site. DESIGN: Prospective, observational study. ANIMALS: Pigs from a commercial operation that were known to be infected with several common swine pathogens. PROCEDURE: Pigs (7 to 10 days old) were weaned and segregated from the farm of origin and compared with littermate control pigs (14 to 17 days old) that were weaned and raised on-site. Pig weight was measured and microbial flora were isolated at 14-day intervals for 84 days, beginning when the pigs were 7 to 10 days old. RESULTS: At 50 days of age, the segregated, early weaned pigs had a mean weight of 23.7 kg, compared with a mean weight of 12.5 kg for control pigs. Pasteurella multocida was isolated from fewer segregated, early weaned pigs than from controls. Signs of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae infection were detected in control pigs but not in segregated early weaned pigs. Clinical, serologic, or bacteriologic signs of early postnatal vertical transmission of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae were not detected in either group. CLINICAL IMPLICATION: Vertical transmission of M hyopneumoniae was prevented by weaning pigs at 7 to 10 days of age and segregating them off-site, without the use of medication. Although medicated controls were not compared, results from this herd revealed that use of antibiotics is not the most important factor for disease control in segregated, early weaning programs. Minimizing antibiotic use in disease-control protocols reduces costs as well as removes the need for extra-label drugs.
TI  - Evaluation of antibiotics for the elimination of the tonsillar carrier state of Streptococcus suis in pigs.
AB  - Seventy clinically normal 13-day-old crossbred pigs from 10 litters from a Streptococcus suis-infected herd were randomly assigned by litter and weight to 7 groups of 10 pigs each to determine whether different antibiotic regimens would eliminate the tonsillar carrier state of S. suis. Six antimicrobial regimens were tested: penicillin intramuscularly (IM) once daily (s.i.d.) for 3 consecutive days; penicillin IM s.i.d. for 5 consecutive days; ampicillin IM s.i.d. for 5 consecutive days; ampicillin per os s.i.d. for 5 consecutive days; ampicillin intranasally s.i.d. for 5 consecutive days; and ceftiofur sodium IM s.i.d. for 5 consecutive days. The seventh group consisted of untreated control pigs. Tonsillar swab samples were collected before treatment, and tonsillar tissue samples were collected after treatment for cultural examination for S. suis. Streptococcus suis was identified in pigs from all groups prior to treatment and after treatment. Pigs did not have clinical signs of disease during the study. All antimicrobial treatments tested in this study failed to eliminate the tonsillar carrier state of S. suis. Early weaning and medication used in this study were not effective for the elimination of the tonsillar carrier state of S. suis in pigs. Optimization of management and environment of pigs coupled with strategic medication of clinically ill animals should be used for control and prevention of mortality caused by streptococcosis.

TI  - The Gal alpha 1-4 Gal-binding adhesin of Streptococcus suis, a gram-positive meningitis-associated bacterium.
AB  - Streptococcus suis causes septicaemia and meningitis in pigs and occasionally in  humans. A major galactose-inhibitable adhesin recognizing the blood group P-related disaccharide Gal alpha 1-4 Gal beta 1--present in the GbO3 glycolipid was identified in S. suis. Two variant adhesins, inhibitable by galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine (type PN) or galactose only (type Po) both preferred the disaccharide in terminal position. The hydrogen bonding patterns were determined using deoxy and other derivatives of the receptor disaccharide, and were compared to that of E. coli PapG396 adhesin. The essential hydroxyls were the HO-4', HO-6', HO-2 and HO-3 hydroxyls; type Po adhesin also weakly interacted with HO-6 and HO-3'. The mechanism differed from that of E. coli which binds to a cluster of five hydroxyls, HO-6, HO-2', HO-3', HO-4' and HO-6'. The purified adhesin had a molecular weight of 18 kDa and an isoelectric point of 6.4. The agglutination of latex-bound purified adhesin was inhibited by the same inhibitors as agglutination with whole bacteria. The adhesin was detected by immunoblot analysis in all 23 S. suis strains examined representing different serotypes, was highly immunogenic and showed opsonizing activity. This represents the first example of the comparison of the saccharide receptor hydrogen bondings of two bacteria of different origin and shows that the same saccharide may be recognised by two different mechanisms. As a potential virulence factor present in different serotypes the adhesin represents a potential vaccine against S. suis infections.
TI  - Prevalence of various phenotypes of Streptococcus suis isolated from swine in the U.S.A. based on the presence of muraminidase-released protein and extracellular factor.
AB  - The present study describes the prevalence of muraminidase-released protein (MRP) and extracellular factor (EF) proteins associated with virulence of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 from a collection of USA strains. Sixty-six strains belonging to serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 10, were analyzed with a set of double antibody sandwich ELISAs and Western blots. Nineteen of 34 serotype 2 strains from cases of swine meningitis had the MRP+EF+ phenotype. Five of 7 serotype 2 strains isolated from lungs had an MRP*EF- phenotype. An MRP-EF+ phenotype was found in 4/34 strains isolated from swine meningitis. The MRP*EF- and MRP-EF+ phenotypes have not been reported previously. All strains of serotypes other than 2, including isolates from cases of meningitis, had the MRP-EF- phenotype, suggesting that these strains must have other, as yet undetected, virulence factors.
TI  - Detection of cervical bacterial contamination in swine by two methods of swabbing in relation to artificial insemination.
AB  - Factors associated with uterine contamination during artificial insemination (AI) are not well defined. A frequently imputed risk factor is vulvar hygiene, although its role has never been assessed objectively. The aim of this study was to identify an objective marker of hygiene during AI and to assess the impact of vulvar hygiene on cervical contamination. In a herd in a depopulation-repopulation process, 68 paired sows of each parity were divided into 2 treatment groups. Before 2 sham AIs, with a 24 hour interval, control sows (CTR) had their vulva cleaned and treatment sows (TRT) had theirs soiled with feces. After the 2nd sham AI, swabbings were taken from the spirette and from the cervix. Bacterial growth was assessed by a semiquantitative method, and aerobic bacterial species identified. The discordance between the paired data was assessed by a McNemar chi-square test. No difference in gram-positive bacterial counts between the 2 groups was found using the cervical swab (P > 0.05). The presence of trace colonies of Escherichia coli were, however, more frequent in TRT (P < 0.05). The spirette showed a greater contamination for mixed flora of bacterial species such as E. coli (P < 0.001) and non-S. suis streptococci (P < 0.05) in TRT sows. A light cervical E. coli growth was more frequent when the vulva had been soiled. Bacterial flora on the spirette following AI may be used as an objective and practical indicator of vulvar hygiene during AI in sows.

TI  - Immunoblot analysis of bacterial polysaccharides: application to the type-specific polysaccharides of Streptococcus suis and Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - A method for the immunoblot analysis of the type-specific capsular polysaccharides of streptococci was developed. The capsular polysaccharides were extracted by sonication and subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the absence of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). After electrophoresis the polysaccharides were transferred to charged PVDF-N membranes and probed with the type specific antibodies. A characteristic ladder-like pattern of polysaccharide bands specific for the serotype (1, 2, 4, 7) was observed for capsular extracts of Streptococcus suis. Human immune sera against type-specific group B streptococcal polysaccharides reacted most strongly with the immunizing polysaccharide type (Ia, II, III). The previously observed crossreactions between the group B streptococcal type-specific capsular preparations were shown to be due to binding to the isomeric polysaccharide molecules. Thus, gel electrophoresis combined with immunoblot analysis seems to provide a novel method for the molecular and immunochemical characterization of bacterial polysaccharides and for the study of the specificity and properties of antibodies to capsular polysaccharides.
TI  - Purification of a galactosyl-alpha 1-4-galactose-binding adhesin from the gram-positive meningitis-associated bacterium Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis causes meningitis, sepsis, and other serious infections in newborn and young pigs and in adult humans. The Gal alpha 1-4Gal-binding adhesin of S. suis was purified to homogeneity by ultrasonic treatment, fractional ammonium sulfate precipitation, and preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Pigeon ovomucoid, a glycoprotein with Gal alpha 1-4Gal terminals, was used to detect the adhesin by blotting. The purified adhesin appeared as single band of an apparent size of 18 kDa and of a pI of 6.4; no disulfide bridges were present. The amount of adhesin as revealed by pigeon ovomucoid binding correlated with the hemagglutination activity of different S. suis strains. The purified adhesin bound to latex particles induced hemagglutination which was specifically inhibited with the same inhibitors as hemagglutination by the intact bacteria, thus demonstrating that the purified protein was the Gal alpha 1-4Gal-recognizing adhesin of S. suis. Two adhesin variants (PN and PO) with differing Gal alpha 1-4Gal binding specificity had the similar electrophoretic mobilities and the same N-terminal peptide sequences, indicating that they were closely related. This represents the first isolation of an adhesin with well-defined cell surface carbohydrate binding activity from Gram-positive bacteria associated with meningitis.

TI  - Influence of dietary beta-glucan on growth performance, nonspecific immunity, and resistance to Streptococcus suis infection in weanling pigs.
AB  - Three experiments, using 344 pigs, were conducted to evaluate the influence of beta-glucan on growth performance, neutrophil and macrophage function, haptoglobin production, and resistance to Streptococcus suis challenge in weanling pigs. In Exp. 1, 144 pigs were used to evaluate the influence of .1% dietary beta-glucan in a soybean meal- or milk protein-based diet on growth performance and neutrophil function. Pigs fed beta-glucan from d 7 to 14 after weaning had lower ADFI (P < .01) and, although not significant, ADG was lower for pigs fed beta-glucan than for pigs fed control diets. However, no differences were observed in growth performance or neutrophil function for pigs fed control or diets containing beta-glucan from d 7 to 35 after weaning. Experiment 2 was a 28-d growth assay in which pigs were fed a diet with or without .1% beta-glucan, containing 7.5% spray-dried plasma protein and 25% dried whey from d 0 to 14 after weaning. Pigs then were fed corn-soybean mealbased diets containing 2.5% spray-dried blood meal and 10% dried whey. No differences in growth performance were observed. Experiment 3 was a 35-d assay to evaluate growth performance, neutrophil and macrophage function, and plasma haptoglobin concentration. Pigs were challenged on d 28 postweaning with intravenous S. suis. In Exp. 3, pigs were fed diets without or with .025 or .05% beta-glucan. Dietary beta-glucan did not influence neutrophil or macrophage function. However, pigs fed diets containing .025% beta-glucan had increased (P < .05) ADG and ADFI and were heavier (P < .05) on d 28 after weaning than pigs fed the control diet. No differences in feed efficiency (G/F) were detected between treatments. Pigs fed beta-glucan had decreased (P < .10) plasma haptoglobin on d 14, 21, and 28 after weaning. However, Fisher's Exact test revealed that more (P < .04) pigs fed a diet containing .025% beta-glucan died by d 12 after challenge with S. suis. In conclusion, these data suggest the existence of a complex interaction involving growth performance and resistance to S. suis in pigs fed .025% beta-glucan.

AB  - Two monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to Streptococcus pneumoniae types 19A and 19F were tested with the 35 reference strains and 334 field strains of Streptococcus suis by dot blotting. Both MAbs reacted with the capsular type 8 reference strain, and one reacted with 69% and one reacted with 100% of 81 S. suis capsular type 8 field strains tested. Epitopes recognized by both MAbs are capsular in origin.
TI  - Comparison of MICs of ceftiofur and other antimicrobial agents against bacterial  pathogens of swine from the United States, Canada, and Denmark.
AB  - The MICs of ceftiofur and other antimicrobial agents, tested for comparison, for  515 bacterial isolates of pigs from the United States, Canada, and Denmark with various diseases were compared. The organisms tested included Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Salmonella choleraesuis, Salmonella typhimurium, Streptococcus suis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, Streptococcus equi subsp. equi, and Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus. In addition to ceftiofur, the following antimicrobial agents or combinations were tested: enrofloxacin, ampicillin, sulfamethazine, trimethoprim-sulfadiazine (1:19), erythromycin, lincomycin, spectinomycin, lincomycin-spectinomycin (1:8), tilmicosin, and tetracycline. Tilmicosin was only tested against the U.S. isolates. Overall, ceftiofur and enrofloxacin were the most active antimicrobial agents tested against all isolates, with MICs inhibiting 90% of isolates tested (MIC90s) of < or = 2.0 and < or = 1.0 microgram/ml, respectively. Erythromycin, sulfamethazine, spectinomycin, and lincomycin demonstrated limited activity against all of the organisms tested, with MIC90s of > or = 8.0, > or = 256.0, > or = 32.0, and > or = 16.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. Trimethoprim-sulfadiazine was active against isolates of A. pleuropneumoniae, S. choleraesuis, S. typhimurium, P. multocida, S. equi, and S. suis (MIC90s, < or = 0.5 microgram/ml) but was less active against the E. coli strains tested (MIC90, > 16.0 micrograms/ml). Ampicillin was active against the P. multocida, S. suis, and S. equi isolates tested (MIC90s, 0.5, 0.06, and 0.06 micrograms/ml, respectively) and was moderately active against S. typhimurium (MIC90s, 2.0 micrograms/ml). However, this antimicrobial agent was much less active when it was tested against A. pleuropneumoniae, S. cholerae-suis, and E. coli (MIC90s, 16.0, > 32.0, and 32.0 micrograms/ml, respectively). Against the U.S. isolates of A. pleuropneumoniae and P. multocida, tilmicosin was moderately active (MIC90s, 4.0 and 8.0 micrograms/ml, respectively). However, this compound was not active against the remaining U.S. isolates (MIC90s, > 64.0 micrograms/ml). Differences in the MICs from one country to another were not detected with enrofloxacin, ceftiofur, or lincomycin for the strains tested, but variations in the MICs of the remaining antimicrobial agents were observed.
TI  - Use of Multiscreen plates for the preparation of bacterial DNA suitable for PCR.
AB  - A rapid and inexpensive method for isolating bacterial DNA for use in PCR is described. The method is based on the guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN)-lysis method of Boom et al. (J. Clin. Microbiol. 28:495-503, 1990) and enables a multiple of 96 samples to be prepared in only one hour. We use Multiscreen plates and a vacuum manifold from Millipore. Clinical samples are lysed and washed in the wells of a Multiscreen plate, and DNA is eluted in a standard microplate. Purified DNA was recovered with high yields (over 25%). The method allows multichannel or robotic pipetting for both the sample preparation as well as for the PCR step. The method has been applied successfully to detect pathogenic Streptococcus suis type 2 in nasal and tonsil swab specimens of pigs.

TI  - Alterations in penicillin-binding proteins in strains of Streptococcus suis possessing moderate and high levels of resistance to penicillin.
AB  - We examined the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of certain field strains of Streptococcus suis, as well as those from laboratory variants having different degrees of resistance to penicillin. Results indicated that (i) S. suis possesses three distinct groups of PBPs, arbitrarily named here PBP 1, PBP 2, and PBP 3, with approximate molecular weights of 97, 82, and 45 kDa respectively; (ii) PBP profiles of field strains of S. suis having different MICs (< or = 0.03) to 16.0 micrograms/ml) were not uniform (PBP 2 being difficult to detect in strains whose MICs exceeded 0.10 micrograms/ml, and PBP 3 which exhibited shifts in molecular weight of approximately 5 kDa); (iii) laboratory variant PBPs 1 and 2 showed decreased affinity for penicillin as compared to the parent strain in antibiotic competition experiments, even though the PBP profiles of both were similar. We suggest that PBP modifications (altered molecular weight and/or decreased affinity for penicillin) are involved in the mechanism of resistance to penicillin by S. suis.
TI  - Agglutination of Streptococcus suis by sialic acid-binding lectins.
AB  - The 35 Streptococcus suis capsular-type reference strains as well as 45 field strains of type 2 were tested with sialic acid-binding lectins from Sambucus nigra (SNA I), Triticum vulgaris, Maackia amurensis, Homarus americanus, and Limax flavus. Only types 1, 1/2, 2, 14, 15, and 16 agglutinated with SNA I and/or the T. vulgaris lectin. All field strains agglutinated only with SNA I. Reaction with SNA I was probably due to the sialic acid moiety since it disappeared after sialidase treatment. These results confirm the presence of sialic acid in S. suis with the possible terminal sequence N-acetylneuraminic acid-alpha(2,6)GalNAc.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a 52-kilodalton immunoglobulin G-binding protein from Streptococcus suis capsular type 2.
AB  - We previously reported that group D streptococci exhibited immunoglobulin G (IgG)-binding activity and that a 52-kDa IgG-binding protein was present in all Streptococcus suis strains examined (B. Serhir, R. Higgins, B. Foiry, and M. Jacques, J. Gen. Microbiol. 139:2953-2958, 1993). The objective of the present study was to purify and characterize this protein. Pig IgG were immobilized through their Fab fragments to ECH-Sepharose 4B, and the protein was purified by affinity chromatography. Electron microscopy observations of the purified material showed filamentous structures with a diameter of approximately 4 nm; these structures were not observed when the material was treated with either urea or ethanolamine. Electrophoretic and Western immunoblot analyses showed that the 52-kDa protein constituted the bulk of the recovered material. This protein was stained with either Coomassie brilliant blue or silver nitrate; it reacted with a large variety of mammalian IgG, human IgG (Fc) fragments, human IgA, and other human plasma proteins. The 52-kDa protein exhibited lower IgG-binding affinities than protein A and protein G. However, it was able to compete with protein A and protein G for binding to human IgG. In addition, it bound chicken IgG with high affinity. This last property differentiated the 52-kDa protein of S. suis from the six IgG-binding proteins described to date. The 52-kDa protein displayed similar affinities for untreated and deglycosylated pig IgG. The N-terminal amino acid sequence (SIITDVYAXEVLDSXGNPTLEV) revealed no homology with any bacterial proteins in the Swiss-Prot database. Its isoelectric point of approximately 4.6 and its amino acid composition, rich in aspartic and glutamic acids, showed that it had some similarities with other IgG-binding proteins. In this report, we have purified and characterized a 52-kDa IgG-binding protein from S. suis capsular type 2. Although this protein shares some similarities with other IgG- and/or IgA-binding proteins, it is unique in reacting with chicken IgG.

TI  - Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome: NEB-1 PRRSV infection did not potentiate bacterial pathogens.
AB  - A 2-phase study was conducted to evaluate the ability of the NEB-1 strain of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) to potentiate common bacterial pathogens of swine. In phase I, 25 of 50 4-5-week-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) pigs were exposed to NEB-1 PRRSV (day 0). Seven days after virus inoculation, 8 groups received 1 of 4 bacterial pathogens: Haemophilus parasuis, Streptococcus suis, Salmonella cholerasuis, and Pasteurella multocida. The ability of NEB-1 PRRSV to produce clinical disease, viremia, neutralizing antibody, gross and microscopic lesions and to potentiate bacterial pathogens was assessed. Response to NEB-1 PRRSV was similar among inoculated pigs; prolonged hyperthermia, lethargy, mild to moderate dyspnea, and cutaneous erythema were consistent clinical signs. No clinical differences were observed in groups after bacterial challenge. Virus was isolated from serum at weekly intervals through the end of the study, and all PRRSV-inoculated pigs had seroconverted by study termination. Two of 5 pigs died in non-PRRSV-inoculated groups challenged with H. parasuis and Streptococcus suis. Mortality in PRRSV-infected pigs was limited to 1 of 5 pigs from the Salmonella cholerasuis-challenged group. Gross lesions were seen in pigs dying after inoculation in H. parasuis- and Streptococcus suis-inoculated groups, in Salmonella cholerasuis- and P. multocida-challenged pigs, and in 1 non-PRRSV-inoculated control pig. Microscopic lesions consisted of mild to moderate proliferative interstitial pneumonia, nonsuppurative myocarditis, lymphoid hyperplasia, and nonsuppurative encephalitis in PRRSV-inoculated pigs. Findings in phase I indicated that NEB-1 PRRSV does not potentiate bacterial disease while inducing consistent clinical signs, viremia, seroconversion, and microscopic lesions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Properties of a Streptococcus suis isolate of serotype 2 and two capsular mutants.
AB  - Encapsulation is thought to be a critical virulence factor of Streptococcus suis. In the present study two capsular type 2 mutants of S. suis (M42 and M2) and their S. suis parent strain (89-1591) were further characterized. All three cultures reacted with group D specific antiserum whereas parent strain 89-1591 and mutant M42 but not mutant M2 reacted with specific antiserum against capsular type 2. Both mutants had higher surface hydrophobicity and showed an increased adherence to human epithelial cells and to lung macrophages of rabbits as compared to the parent strain. In phagocytosis experiments with polymorphonuclear leucocytes the encapsulated parent strain was more resistant to phagocytosis than both mutant strains. These findings might help to understand the role of encapsulation of S. suis in the process of infection.

TI  - Discrimination of virulent and avirulent Streptococcus suis capsular type 2 isolates from different geographical origins.
AB  - In an effort to relate the protein profile to virulence, proteins from the cellular fractions and from culture supernatants of Streptococcus suis capsular type 2 strains from different geographical origins were compared by using Western blots (immunoblots). The protein profiles of the cellular fractions were similar for the majority of virulent and avirulent isolates studied, with the exception of three virulent Canadian strains for which a 135-kDa protein was not detected. Examination of the culture supernatants revealed the presence of a 135-kDa protein in all strains except the same three virulent Canadian isolates. In addition, a 110-kDa protein was present in 14 of 16 virulent strains and not in avirulent isolates. When injected into mice, the 110-kDa protein induced an immunoglobulin G response and protected against infection with homologous and heterologous virulent strains. Four strains (1330, 0891, TD10, and R75/S2) that were avirulent in the mouse model of infection and four other strains (1591, 999, JL590, and AAH4) that were virulent in the mouse model were injected into pigs. All virulent strains reproduced the disease, and all avirulent strains failed to reproduce the disease (with the exception of transient lameness in one case and fever in another case). The 110-kDa protein therefore appears to be a reliable virulence marker and a good candidate for a subunit vaccine.
TI  - Detection of genomic heterogeneity in Streptococcus suis isolates by DNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms of rRNA genes (ribotyping).
AB  - Whole-cell chromosomal digests of 54 isolates of Streptococcus suis encompassing  all known serotypes from a geographically varied collection were examined by PstI restriction fragment length polymorphisms and then hybridized with a digoxigenin-11-dUTP-labeled cDNA probe transcribed from a mixture of 16S and 23S rRNAs from Escherichia coli MRE600. The hybridization patterns showed genetic heterogeneity within and between S. suis serotypes. Most isolates (87%) representing 28 serotypes contained a common band at approximately 1.8 kb. However, 13% of the isolates representing seven serotypes lacked the 1.8-kb band, indicating that the species as currently defined is diverse. Nonetheless, the 1.8-kb band may be a useful genotypic marker for identification of most S. suis isolates. We tested the ability of this technique to discriminate between virulent and avirulent S. suis type 2 isolates. A virulent strain of S. suis type 2 could be distinguished from avirulent strains by the presence of specific bands. No correlation was obvious between band pattern and hemolysin production.
TI  - Distribution of serotype, virulence markers and further characteristics of Streptococcus suis isolates from pigs.
AB  - This study was designed to comparatively investigate 28 S. suis cultures isolated from various pathological processes of pigs. All cultures could be identified biochemically and most of the cultures could be serogrouped with specific antiserum against Lancefield's serogroup D. Serotyping of the S. suis isolates mainly revealed capsular types 2, 1, and 22. In addition, part of the cultures, mostly those of serotype 2, reacted with monoclonal antibodies to the virulence protein muraminidase-released protein, and, in parallel with monoclonal antibodies against the virulence protein extracellular factor. Independently of serotype and the occurrence of both virulence proteins, four cultures haemagglutinated erythrocytes from pigs, humans and rabbits. The haemagglutination reaction appeared to be related to the surface hydrophobicity of the isolates. However, part of the cultures with hydrophobic surfaces did not haemagglutinate the available erythrocyte preparations. The surface characteristics of the S. suis isolates shown in this investigation could be used to characterize individual isolates of S. suis that might be of importance for epidemiological studies.

TI  - Influence of recombinant bovine interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-2 in pigs vaccinated and challenged with Streptococcus suis.
AB  - An experiment was conducted to determine the adjuvanticity of recombinant bovine  IL-1 beta (rBoIL-1 beta) and recombinant bovine IL-2 (rBoIL-2) administered in conjunction with a single Streptococcus suis vaccination in pigs. Sixty 4-week-old pigs were allotted to eight groups: nonvaccinated controls; vaccinated controls; rBoIL-beta at 0.1, 1, and 10 micrograms kg-1; rBoIL-2 at 2.5, 25, and 250 micrograms kg-1. All pigs (except nonvaccinated controls) were vaccinated on Day 0 with a commercial Streptococcus suis vaccine (serotypes 1 and 2). At vaccination, pigs were injected intramuscularly with their respective cytokine treatments. Pigs received additional cytokine injections on 2 consecutive days. On Day 21, all pigs were challenged intravenously with 3.2 x 10(9) colony forming units of a log phase culture of S. suis (serotype 2). The highest dose of rBoIL-1 beta exceeded the maximum tolerable dose for the cytokine; however, this dose of rBoIL-1 beta protected pigs from the S. suis challenge. Pigs administered rBoIL-1 beta at 10 micrograms kg-1 had higher antibody responses to S. suis, less severe clinical signs of the disease after challenge, better growth performance during the infection, and less severe gross pathological lesions caused by the bacteria. No pigs in this treatment group died from the bacterial challenge. These data suggest that rBoIL-1 beta (10 micrograms kg-1), administered intramuscularly for 3 consecutive days at vaccination, is more effective than a single S. suis vaccination alone in protecting pigs against a S. suis challenge.
TI  - Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome: clinical disease, pathology and immunosuppression.
AB  - Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) was first known as blue-eared pig disease in the United Kingdom and the causative agent as 'Lelystad virus'. The disease is characterised by very variable clinical signs, including reproductive failure and respiratory disease. The respiratory syndrome is often associated with severe infection with secondary bacterial agents including Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus parasuis and Streptococcus suis. However, some seropositive herds show no clinical signs of disease. The secondary infections may be facilitated by the destruction of circulating lymphocytes, by the destruction of the mucociliary clearance system and, most importantly, by a large reduction in the numbers of alveolar macrophages. The clinical syndrome observed in a herd may therefore depend in part upon the other diseases present.
TI  - Recovery from bilateral vestibular failure: implications for visual and cervico-ocular function.
AB  - We report a patient who sustained severe bilateral labyrinthine lesions during Streptococcus suis meningitis but considerably recovered vestibular function over a 7 month period. This unique case allowed us to examine the cervico-ocular reflex (COR) and visual function at various levels of activity of his vestibular system. The slow phase COR, elicited by trunk oscillation (0.2 Hz) with the head earth-stationary, was negligible immediately after the acute vestibular loss but rose to a gain of 0.51 one month after. Seven months later, when vestibular function was improved, COR gain dropped to a gain of 0.15. Measurements of spatial visual function during whole body oscillation in the acute stage and after 6 months showed marked improvement which correlated entirely with VOR measurements in the dark and during optic fixation. This patient also showed the unique feature that, in the acute stage, eye movement gain and visual function were poorer during whole body motion than during identical visual target motion. These findings suggest that: i) the COR may be inhibited by the presence of vestibular signals, ii) spatial vision measurements provide accurate assessment of the patient's visual blur during head motion, and iii) the severe oscillopsia experienced by patients in the acute stage of vestibular loss may not only be due to the absence of the VOR; additional degradation in eye movements during head motion, perhaps arising from acutely distorted labyrinthine signals, may also play a part.
TI  - Streptococcus suis infection in Hong Kong.
AB  - Twenty-five patients were admitted to two hospitals in Hong Kong for Streptococcus suis infection between 1984 and 1993. Among them, 15 (60%) had an occupational exposure to pigs or pork, and four had a clear history of skin injury up to 16 days before admission. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid of 21 patients confirmed the presence of meningitis in every case; the remaining four patients who did not have lumbar punctures had each presented with arthritis, bronchopneumonia, endocarditis and pyrexia without neck stiffness. The only fatality was a patient admitted in septicaemic shock with evidence of meningitis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Of the 24 survivors, 16 (67%) acquired varying degrees of hearing loss as a result of meningitic involvement. All the isolates of S. suis were sensitive to penicillin or ampicillin, which was used alone or in combination with other antibiotics for every patient. Two patients had a relapse of symptoms when penicillin was stopped, but were successfully treated after the antibiotic was resumed for a total of 6 weeks. Over 100 cases of S. suis infection have been described previously, with a geographic distribution heavily biased towards Northern Europe and Southeast Asia. Lack of awareness of this unique zoonosis may be a reason why it is not diagnosed more readily elsewhere.
TI  - Characterization of Streptococcus suis capsular type 2 haemolysin.
AB  - The production of a haemolysin by Streptococcus suis capsular type 2 was investigated. Human group O erythrocytes were the most susceptible, followed by horse, sheep, cow and pig red blood cells, which exhibited similar susceptibilities; rabbit erythrocytes were the least susceptible. The haemolysin was produced at the end of the exponential growth phase. The toxin described in this paper was purified by affinity chromatography using a thiopropyl-Sepharose 6B column. It is an extracellular protein with a molecular mass of 65 kDa. The haemolysin belongs to the family of toxins known as antigenically related cholesterol-binding cytolytic toxins, since it shares common characteristics with other members of this family, such as sensitivity to oxygen and oxidizing agents, activation by reducing agents, inhibition by low concentrations of cholesterol, formation of transmembrane pores and a 'multihit' mechanism of action. In addition, anti-streptolysin antibodies inhibited the haemolytic activity caused by the S. suis haemolysin. Antibodies against the haemolysin could not be detected in pigs experimentally infected with a haemolytic positive strain of S. suis capsular type 2. To our knowledge, this is the only Lancefield group D Streptococcus producing a haemolysin with these characteristics. The role of this haemolysin in the pathogenesis of S. suis infections remains to be investigated.
TI  - High-efficiency transformation and gene inactivation in Streptococcus suis type 2.
AB  - An efficient electrotransformation system for Streptococcus suis type 2 is described. It is demonstrated that vectors based on the broad-host-range plasmid pWVO1 replicate in S. suis type 2. Transformation efficiencies of about 10(7) transformants per micrograms of plasmid DNA could be obtained. Derivatives of plasmid pBR322 containing S. suis chromosomal DNA did not replicate but integrated into the chromosome. Southern hybridization analysis revealed that double as well as single cross-over integration events had occurred. Double cross-over events occurred at a frequency of about 15%. With these transformation and integration systems, recombinant DNA technology can now be applied to this important pathogenic species.
TI  - Streptococcus suis infections in birds.
AB  - Four cases of Streptococcus suis infection were diagnosed in psittacine birds and four others in zebrafinches, bullfinches, canaries and a duck. The main clinical and pathological manifestation was septicaemia with multiple sudden deaths in nestlings, young and adults. Other cases were solitary, with evidence for secondary involvement of S. suis. Four serotypable strains all belonged to serotype 9.
TI  - Susceptibility of Streptococcus suis to various antimicrobial agents.
AB  - A study was performed to determine the susceptibility of 59 S. suis strains, isolated from sick and healthy carrier swine, to a range of antimicrobial agents. The beta-lactamic group proved more active both in Kirby-Bauer and MCI tests. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole emerged as an alternative drug in chemoprevention and treatment of S. suis infections.
TI  - Oligosaccharide-receptor interaction of the Gal alpha 1-4Gal binding adhesin of Streptococcus suis. Combining site architecture and characterization of two variant adhesin specificities.
AB  - The sugar binding specificities of two groups of Streptococcus suis, a pig pathogen that causes meningitis also in man, were determined. Both the group represented by a recently characterized strain inhibitable by galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine (type PN) and the group inhibitable by galactose (type PO) were found by hemagglutination and solid-phase binding inhibition experiments to recognize the disaccharide Gal alpha 1-4Gal of the P1 and Pk blood group antigens. Both types preferred the disaccharide in terminal position. PN showed some, whereas PO showed almost no, binding to the globoside oligosaccharide containing an additional GalNAc beta 1-3 residue. The complete hydrogen bonding patterns were determined by using deoxy and other synthetic derivatives of the receptor disaccharide, and the constructed models of the interactions were compared with that of Escherichia coli PapG396 adhesin. The essential hydroxyls for binding were the HO-4', HO-6', HO-2, and HO-3 hydroxyls on the beta' alpha-side of the Gal alpha 1-4Gal molecule. Type PO adhesin also formed weak interactions with the hydroxyls HO-6 and HO-3'. The mechanism differed from that of E. coli, which binds to a cluster of five hydroxyls (HO-6, HO-2', HO-3', HO-4', and HO-6') and thus to a different part of the receptor disaccharide. These results represent the first example of the comparison of the saccharide receptor hydrogen bonding patterns of two bacterial organisms of different origin and show that the same saccharide may be recognized by two different binding mechanisms.
TI  - Biochemical traits and antimicrobial susceptibility of Streptococcus suis isolated from slaughtered pigs.
AB  - A total of 522 Streptococcus suis isolates were recovered from the tonsils of slaughtered pigs by culturing on media containing different specific antisera. The serogroup reactions were determined by coagglutination. The most frequently isolated serotype was serotype 4 (representing 28.7% of the isolates), followed by serotype 3 (24.9%) and serotype 2 (22.6%). Typable isolates were examined by growth in 6.5% NaCl, amylase activity, acetoin production, susceptibility to optochin and production of acid from mannitol, melibiose, raffinose, salicin, sorbitol and trehalose. Finally, all isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility against ampicillin, cephalotin, lincomycin, neomycin, penicillin, spiramycin and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole using the disk-diffusion technique. All isolates were amylase-positive and acetoin-negative, and failed to grow in 6.5% NaCl broth. Nine isolates were optochin-susceptible. Moreover, 10 isolates produced acid from mannitol, 21 produced acid from sorbitol, and 36 and 37 did not produce acid from salicin and trehalose, respectively. Six salicin- and trehalose-negative isolates and two mannitol- and sorbitol-fermenting isolates were found. Biochemical differences between serotypes were not observed. The most active drugs against S. suis were the beta-lactam antibiotics, although only 83.3%, 70% and 78.5% of isolates were susceptible to ampicillin, cephalotin and penicillin, respectively. Half of the isolates were resistant to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, and resistance to lincomycin, neomycin and spiramycin appeared to be very high.
TI  - The prevalence of Streptococcus suis type 2 in Western Australian piggeries.
AB  
TI  - Clonal analysis and virulence of Australian isolates of Streptococcus suis type 2.
AB  - Multilocus enzyme electrophoresis was used to divide 124 Australian isolates of Streptococcus suis type 2 into 17 electrophoretic types (ETs). Isolates in ET 1 were the most frequent cause of disease amongst Western Australian pigs, but isolates of ET 8 were more commonly associated with disease in other Australian states. Multiple isolates from 10 of 19 farms all belonged to the same ET, whilst isolates from the other farms belonged to between 2 and 4 different ETs. Some isolates could be differentiated further by DNA restriction endonuclease analysis, whilst others with the same restriction pattern were located in different, but closely-related ETs. Fourteen isolates were tested for their virulence in mice. Most caused disease if given in high numbers, but isolates in ET 1 were virulent at lower dose rates. This virulent clone also was distinguished by the fact that 80% of isolates produced extracellular factor (EF).
TI  - Immunization of mice against Streptococcus suis serotype 2 infections using a live avirulent strain.
AB  - In this study, the IgG response of mice injected with two virulent strains and one avirulent Streptococcus suis capsular type 2 strain was compared by Western blotting. The serum from mice immunized against the avirulent strain could recognize most proteins of the various strains tested and similar results were obtained with serum from mice injected with virulent strains. The live avirulent strain was injected twice (days 0 and 10) to groups of five mice, and four virulent strains from different geographical origins were used to challenge the animals. All mice, except one in one group, survived the challenge. These results suggest that a live avirulent strain could be used for immunization of swine, the natural host.
TI  - Relation between encapsulation and various properties of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Encapsulation is thought to be a critical virulence factor for Streptococcus suis. In this study, encapsulation of a selected S. suis culture could be stimulated by cultivation conditions. After cultivation of the S. suis culture in fluid media supplemented with serum, the culture grew with short chains and a uniform turbidity of the growth medium. Autoclave extracts of this culture reacted with capsular type-1-specific antiserum. After cultivation of the S. suis culture in fluid media without serum, the bacteria generally formed longer chains, grew in fluid medium as granular sediment with clear supernatant, and were non-typeable. In addition, the unencapsulated variant appeared to have a more hydrophobic surface and adhered significantly more to HeLa cells. In contrast to the unencapsulated variant, the encapsulated S. suis was phagocytosed to a lesser extent by polymorphonuclear leucocytes. These findings might help to elucidate the role of encapsulation in infections with this bacterial organism.
TI  - Genomic relatedness among reference strains of different Streptococcus suis serotypes.
AB  - Hybridization studies using genomic DNA and a rDNA probe revealed genetic relatedness among reference strains of different Streptococcus suis serotypes. Although most serotype 22 isolates are biochemically atypical, the reference strain of capsular type 22 is genetically related to other S. suis serotypes, but not to Streptococcus pneumoniae. Using DNA digested with BamHI and BglII for ribotyping, some S. suis reference strains had common patterns, but this analysis mainly revealed variations in patterns of S. suis strains of different serotypes.
TI  - Binding of mannan-binding protein to various bacterial pathogens of meningitis.
AB  - Mannan-binding protein (MBP), a calcium-dependent plasma lectin, may play a role  in the innate defence against microorganisms. After binding to carbohydrate structures at the bacterial surface, MBP activates the classical pathway of the complement system. To investigate the binding capacity of MBP to various bacteria associated with meningitis, an assay was developed to study the binding of MBP to bacteria grown in a semisynthetic fluid culture medium. Salmonella montevideo (containing a mannose-rich lipopolysaccharide (LPS)), used as a positive control strain, showed binding of radiolabelled MBP at a level of 80% compared with binding of MBP to zymosan. Binding of labelled MBP to Salm. montevideo was time-dependent, temperature-dependent and saturable. The binding was inhibited by unlabelled MBP, by mannose and by N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. Among bacterial pathogens often found to cause meningitis, a wide range of MBP binding capacities could be determined. The encapsulated Neisseria meningitidis (representatives from 11 serogroups other than group A were included: n = 22), N. mucosa (n = 1), Haemophilus influenzae type b (n = 10) and Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 5) had a low MBP binding capacity of 21.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.3-40.1%). Escherichia coli K1 (n = 11), Strep. suis (n = 5), Strep. pneumoniae (n = 10) and N. meningitidis serogroup A (n = 2) showed intermediate MBP binding capacity of 58.4% (95% CI 40.0-76.8%). A third group consisting of non-encapsulated Listeria monocytogenes (n = 11), non-encapsulated H. influenzae (n = 2), non-encapsulated N. meningitidis (n = 2), N. cinera (n = 1) and N. subflava (n = 1) strains had a high MBP binding capacity of 87.5% (95% CI 62.5-112.5%). The majority of encapsulated pathogens causing bacterial meningitis seem to have a rather low MBP binding capacity.
TI  - Serotypes and putative virulence markers of Streptococcus suis isolates from cats and dogs.
AB  - Thirteen isolates of Streptococcus suis from cats and dogs were characterised. Formamide extracts of 10 of the 13 cultures reacted with group D specific antiserum, and serotyping of the cultures with specific antisera against capsular types 1 to 28 revealed the serotypes 9, 20, 1/2, 22, 26 and 4; the remaining cultures were untypable. In addition one of the cultures reacted with monoclonal antibodies against muramidase-released protein and in parallel with monoclonal antibodies against the extracellular factor (EF) of S suis. The latter reacted with proteins with a molecular weight of more than 150,000 indicating that the strain exhibited EF-related proteins. One of the 13 cultures haemagglutinated erythrocytes from human beings and various animal species and adhered in large numbers to HeLa cells.
TI  - Comparison of pig, rabbit and mouse IgG response to Streptococcus suis serotype 2 proteins and active immunization of mice against the infection.
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the IgG response of different animal species to Streptococcus suis serotype 2 proteins and to evaluate the immunogenic potential of these proteins in the mouse experimental model of infection. The protein profiles of ten different S. suis capsular type 2 isolates were compared by Western blotting using antisera produced in mice, rabbits and pigs against the reference strain. Strains were grown overnight in Todd-Hewitt broth, harvested by centrifugation, processed in a French press cell and digested with lysozyme. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was then performed and proteins transferred to nitrocellulose. The rabbit antiserum recognized seventeen common immunoreactive proteins, of which, proteins of 33, 44, 96, 122 kDa were present in all strains. Two, 128 and 136 kDa proteins were recognized by swine serum in many strains. An additional protein of 30 kDa was recognized by the mouse antiserum. These seven proteins, originating from the reference strain, were excised directly from polyacrylamide gels, mixed with incomplete Freund's adjuvant and given to groups of five mice on days 0 and 10. Immunoglobulin G response to each protein was monitored on day 20 using Western blots. Mice were then experimentally infected on day 21. Results indicated that vaccination with proteins of 33, 44, 128 and 136 kDa resulted in an IgG response and protection against the challenge with the reference strain, but gave only a partial protection against another virulent S. suis serotype 2 strain.
TI  - Lesions caused by natural infection with Streptococcus suis type 9 in weaned pigs.
AB  - In this paper we report on the spectrum and frequency of lesions observed in a prospective study of naturally occurring infections with Streptococcus suis type 9 (SS-9) in weaned pigs. SS-9 produced arthritis, meningitis, interstitial pneumonia, and endocarditis in 100%, 91%, 73%, and 42%, respectively, of pigs dying from the disease. The lesions were similar to those caused by S. suis type 2 (SS-2), however, SS-9 produced a different frequency of lesions. In SS-2 infections, bronchopneumonia is the most commonly observed lesion; meningitis, arthritis, and endocarditis are less frequently observed. Thus, SS-9 produced a different distribution of lesions from that reported for SS-2. Possible explanations for the differences found are discussed.
TI  - Streptococcus suis infection in swine: a retrospective study of 256 cases. Part II. Clinical signs, gross and microscopic lesions, and coexisting microorganisms.
AB  - A retrospective study of 256 cases of naturally acquired Streptococcus suis infections in swine submitted to the Indiana Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory from 1985 to 1989 was undertaken to describe the clinical signs, lesions, and coexisting organisms associated with S. suis serotypes 1-8 and 1/2. Infected pigs generally had clinical signs and gross lesions referable to either the respiratory system or to the central nervous system (CNS), but not both. Neurologic signs were inversely related to gross lesions in the respiratory tract (R2 = -0.19, P = 0.003), as were respiratory signs and gross lesions in the CNS (R2 = -0.19, P = 0.003). Suppurative bronchopneumonia was the most common gross lesion observed (55.2%, overall). Fibrinous and/or suppurative pleuritis, epicarditis, pericarditis, arthritis, peritonitis, and polyserositis were also reported. In 68% of the pigs, other bacteria in addition to S. suis were isolated. Escherichia coli (35.0%) and Pasteurella multocida (30.0%) were the most commonly recovered bacterial agents. Mycoplasma and viral agents were identified less often, and their role in the development of streptococcosis was difficult to assess. In pigs infected with serotypes 2-5, 7, 8, and 1/2, suppurative meningitis with suppurative or nonsuppurative encephalitis, suppurative bronchopneumonia, fibrinopurulent epicarditis, multifocal myocarditis, and cardiac vasculitis were the most common microscopic lesions observed, whereas pigs infected with serotype 1 generally presented with suppurative meningitis and interstitial pneumonia. Microscopic lesions were morphologically similar among serotypes and were also similar to those reported with other pyogenic bacteria.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Identification and composition of the streptococcal and enterococcal flora of tonsils, intestines and faeces of pigs.
AB  - Streptococcus suis was the most frequent Streptococcus spp. in pig tonsils, followed by the beta-haemolytic porcine 'equisimilis' ecovar of Strep. dysgalactiae. The intestinal streptococcal flora was composed of Strep. bovis, Strep. hyointestinalis and Strep. suis. Many of these intestinal Strep. suis belonged to a beta-glucuronidase-negative biotype which is infrequent in lesions. Nearly half of the strains presumptively identified as Strep. alactolyticus produced acid from lactose. This species was not found in tonsils and intestines but was about equally prevalent as Strep. hyointestinalis in pig faeces and rectal swabs. Other streptococci were rare in this material. Enterococci were much less frequently identified than streptococci in tonsils and faeces. In intestinal samples Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. faecium, Ent. hirae and Ent. cecorum were most frequently found. In faeces Ent. faecium was the most prevalent enterococcus. The characteristics of the less well known species Strep. alactolyticus and Strep. hyointestinalis are described in detail, and guidelines for their differentiation from Strep. bovis and Strep. suis given.
TI  - Influence of interleukin-1 on neutrophil function and resistance to Streptococcus suis in neonatal pigs.
AB  - Nonspecific immunity is usually lower in neonates than adults. Consequently, enhancing the neonate's nonspecific immune capability may be beneficial for the health and growth performance of young animals. We conducted two experiments in which neonatal pigs were injected with recombinant bovine interleukin-1 beta (rBoIL-1 beta) at 9 to 11 days of age. Three consecutive daily injections of rBoIL-1 beta increased neutrophil and monocyte numbers, which remained elevated until the animals were challenged with Streptococcus suis at 19 days of age. Neutrophil bactericidal activity was greater in interleukin-1-treated pigs than in saline-injected controls. At lower ratios of effector to target cells, neutrophil-mediated, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity was increased in neonates treated with IL-1. However, natural killer cell activity and neutrophil production of superoxide anion were not affected by treatment with IL-1. Expression of CD18 was increased transiently on neutrophils from IL-1-treated pigs at 15 days of age. Severity of the streptococcal infection was less in pigs that were treated with IL-1 at 9 to 11 days of age. These data suggest that IL-1 treatment in neonates may augment nonspecific immune function and disease resistance.
TI  - Characterization of antibiotic resistance in Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Twenty one isolates of Streptococcus suis were screened for antibiotic resistance by growth on antibiotic-containing media, by measuring minimum inhibitory concentrations, by hybridization to specific DNA and oligonucleotide probes for antibiotic resistance genes, and by PCR. The isolates were from a slaughter house survey of respiratory pathogens in Norwegian pigs in 1986. Fifteen isolates were resistant to tetracycline, with MICs ranging from 4-128 micrograms/ml. Genes coding for the Tet O and Tet M determinants were detected in eight and five isolates, respectively. Genes coding for other Gram positive Tet determinants, Tet K, Tet L, and Tet P, were not detected. One isolate was constitutive resistant to erythromycin with MIC of 128 micrograms/ml. Five other isolates carried inducible erythromycin resistance. All these isolates, and five others, were positive in a PCR assay for erythromycin resistance, and hybridized with the Erm C and/or Erm B probes. No resistance against chloramphenicol (5 micrograms/ml) or rifampin (10 micrograms/ml) could be could be detected, but five isolates were resistant to streptomycin (250 micrograms/ml), four isolates were resistant to kanamycin (10 micrograms/ml), and one isolate was resistant to fusicic acid (10 micrograms/ml). In mating experiments with Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 as recipient, tetracycline, erythromycin, and kanamycin genes were transferred separately to the recipient strain at a rate of 10(-7) transconjugants/recipient cell.

TI  - Identification, purification, and characterization of a thiol-activated hemolysin (suilysin) of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - The present report describes the identification, purification, and characterization of a hemolysin produced by Streptococcus suis type 2. The hemolysin was purified from the culture supernatant by using different filtration steps, Superose-12 column chromatography, and selective (NH4)2SO4 precipitation. The purified hemolysin, designated suilysin, had an apparent molecular mass of 54,000 Da and exhibited a specific activity of 0.7 x 10(6) hemolytic units per mg. Suilysin appeared to belong to a family of toxins known as the thiol-activated toxins, with which it had several characteristics in common: loss of activity upon oxidation, reactivation upon reduction, and inhibition of activity by small amounts of cholesterol. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of suilysin showed many similarities with parts of the deduced N-terminal amino acid sequences of perfringolysin O, streptolysin O, listeriolysin O, alveolysin, and pneumolysin. Mice immunized with a vaccine containing purified suilysin appeared to be completely protected against a lethal S. suis type 2 challenge, indicating that suilysin is an important factor and that the neutralization of this single factor is sufficient to protect mice against the detrimental effects of an S. suis type 2 infection. Most of the different (serotype) strains appeared to secrete hemolytic activity which was biochemically and immunologically indistinguishable from suilysin into the culture supernatant in vitro, indicating that suilysin might be a cross-protection factor.
TI  - Partial characterization of Streptococcus suis type 2 hemolysin.
AB  - Streptococcus suis type 2 was evaluated for hemolysin production. Supernatants of S. suis type 2 grown in Todd-Hewitt broth were assayed for hemolytic activity by a photometric assay. Twenty-two additional serotypes of S. suis (1,3 to 22, and 1/2) were evaluated for hemolysin production; nine of them (1/2, 1, 4, 5, 14, 15, 17, 19, and 20) were positive. The effects of temperature, atmosphere, centrifugation, sonication, chemicals, bovine serum albumin, fetal calf serum, and enzymes on S. suis type 2 hemolysin activity were studied. Maximum hemolysis occurred after incubation in RPMI 1640 medium at 40 degrees C in 6% CO2 and after growth in Todd-Hewitt broth at 37 degrees C under anaerobic conditions. Hemolytic activity was absent after the addition of fetal calf serum and decreased after the addition of trypsin or amylase. However, treatment of erythrocytes with amylase or trypsin prior to incubation with supernatant also resulted in a decrease in hemolytic activity. The addition of bovine serum albumin caused increased hemolytic activity. Dipyridyl and EDTA had negligible effects on hemolysis. Hemolytic S. suis type 2 culture supernatant injected intraperitoneally failed to cause death in BALB/c mice. Data from our study indicate that S. suis type 2 hemolysin is a secreted or loosely cell bound, thermolabile molecule whose activity is growth condition dependent.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of Streptococcus suis isolates.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of penicillin (PEN), ampicillin (AMP), cephalothin (CT), trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), streptomycin (STM), and gentamicin (GM) against 122 representative strains of Streptococcus suis, were compared by the agar dilution procedure. The current US National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) breakpoints for non-enterococcal streptococci were used for PEN, AMP, CT, and TMP-SMX. Overall, 50% of strains were not fully susceptible to PEN, whereas these percentages for AMP and CT were 9% and 6% respectively. One strain was resistant to TMP-SMX. High-level GM resistance could not be detected, but more than 46% of strains were highly resistant to STM (MIC > 2000 mg l-1). This high percentage of resistance to STM precludes the use of this aminoglycoside-penicillin combination as empiric therapy in severe S. suis infections. These results should prompt microbiology laboratories to carry out antimicrobial susceptibility tests on a routine basis on S. suis isolates.

TI  - Streptococcus suis meningitis complicated with permanent perceptive deafness: report of a case.
AB  - A 61-year-old pig farmer was found to be suffering from meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis type II. He was successfully treated with intravenous penicillin G but was left with permanent deafness. B-cell lymphoma was also diagnosed one year later. S. suis is a zoonotic pathogen which causes meningitis, septicemia and endocarditis in pigs. Human infection is rare and often presents as meningitis with the sequela of permanent deafness. It has previously been reported in pig rearing countries such as Holland or Hong Kong. This is the second documented case of human meningitis caused by S. suis in Taiwan, which is also a major pig rearing country in Asia. Infections caused by viridans streptococci or other beta-hemolytic streptococci in Taiwan may therefore actually be due to S. suis. Further investigation of the possibility of the underlying deficiency of humoral immunity is warranted.
TI  - [Streptococcal infections as cause of death in pigs brought in for necropsy].
AB  - Research was carried out into the prevalence of streptococcal types isolated from pigs that died of septicaemia, meningo-encephalitis, endocarditis, and pneumonia and which were brought in for investigation from 1 january 1988 to 31 December 1991. Cultures were prepared from the liver, spleen, kidneys, and brains of all animals and from the heart valves, joints, bronchi, and lungs of animals with pathological changes. The results are presented in six tables. As a group, streptococci were a major source of bacterial infection in septicaemia (38%), meningo-encephalitis (21%), and endocarditis (74%). Of the streptococcus types. Streptococcus suis type 2 was isolated the most often in sepsis (36%), meningo-encephalitis (52%), and endocarditis (36%). Streptococcus suis type 1 was found not only in piglets up to the age of weaning but also in older pigs and was a common pathogen in pigs with endocarditis. The discussion takes into consideration data from the literature. It is concluded that the significance of streptococcus infections, and those involving Streptococcus suis types 1 and 2 in particular, has increased under the influence of environmental and management factors (scaling-up of production, import of pigs from abroad, extermination and control of other pig diseases).
TI  - Identification of Streptococcus suis isolated from swine: proposal for biochemical parameters.
AB  - A study was made of the biochemical profiles of 59 strains serotyped as Streptococcus suis, isolated from diseased and clinically healthy pigs. The following parameters are proposed for the identification of the species: Voges-Proskauer negativity, hydrolysis of esculin positivity, trehalose positivity, negativity for growth in 6.5% NaCl, and absence of beta-hemolysis on sheep blood agar. S. suis serotype 2 is negative for hippurate, pyrrolidonylarylamidase, and mannose.
TI  - Interaction between Streptococcus suis serotype 2 and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus in specific pathogen-free piglets.
AB  - Secondary specific pathogen-free (sSPF) piglets were inoculated intranasally with Streptococcus suis serotype 2 alone, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) alone, or with PRRSV followed by S suis. Uninfected piglets were used as controls. Pigs inoculated with PRRSV (ATCC VR-2332) followed by challenge with a virulent strain (87555) of S suis serotype 2 developed clinical signs, suppurative meningitis and large numbers of S suis in their tissues, including the brain and meninges. Pigs inoculated with PRRSV alone, S suis (87555) alone, or with PRRSV and the DH5 strain of S suis serotype 2 (lacking a protein associated with virulence) and the uninfected piglets did not develop clinical signs or lesions or have large numbers of bacteria in their tissues. The results suggest that PRRSV predisposes sSPF pigs to infection and disease caused by virulent S suis serotype 2. Co-infection of piglets with PRRSV and a virulent strain of S suis may provide a useful model for the study of S suis septicaemia and meningitis.
TI  - Evaluation of the antibody response in pigs vaccinated against Streptococcus suis capsular type 2 using a double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
AB  - A double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was standardized for the detection of specific antibodies following vaccination with Streptococcus suis capsular type 2 bacterins. No statistically significant increase of antibody titers was detected in vaccinated piglets compared to the nonvaccinated control group, even if a minority of piglets demonstrated an important postvaccinal response. Three of four vaccinated sows showed a low antibody response to vaccine and specific immunity was detected in piglets of only one litter of these three sows. Passive protection studies showed that none of the sera from vaccinated piglets were protective for mice whereas serum obtained from hyperimmunized pigs gave protection.
TI  - Increase of capsular material thickness following in vivo growth of virulent Streptococcus suis serotype 2 strains.
AB  - Protein profile and capsular material thickness of Streptococcus suis serotype 2  strains were compared after in vitro and in vivo growth. Three virulent and one avirulent strains were used. These strains were grown in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth, cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in a sterile saline solution and injected in diffusion chambers. The devices were then inserted in rat abdomens for 17 h. In vitro grown strains were also inoculated into fresh BHI broth and cultivated for 17 h at 37 degrees C. In vivo as well as in vitro grown bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, processed in a French pressure cell, treated with lysozyme and centrifuged to collect cell proteins for SDS-PAGE analysis. Transmission electron microscopy using polycationic ferritin labeling to stabilize capsular material was also carried out. No significant modification was noted in the protein profile for any strain after in vivo growth except for a 39 kDa protein of one virulent strain. On the other hand, an increase in thickness of capsular material was noted for the three in vivo grown virulent strains while no change was noted for the avirulent strain. This increase in capsular material thickness of virulent strains was accompanied by an increased resistance to killing by pig polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The capacity to produce more capsular material in vivo seems to be an attribute of some virulent S. suis serotype 2 strains.
TI  - Isolation, characterization and protection studies in mice of a streptomycin-dependent mutant of Streptococcus suis type 1/2.
AB  - An avirulent, streptomycin-dependent (Str-D) mutant of Streptococcus suis type 1/2 was produced and characterized by its antimicrobial susceptibility, growth kinetics, biochemical reactions and reversion rate. Homologous and heterologous vaccine trials in mice resulted in complete protection against challenge with S. suis types 1 and 1/2 and partial protection against challenge with S. suis type 2.
TI  - Detection of immunoglobulin-G-binding proteins in Streptococcus suis.
AB  - This study was undertaken to search for the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG)-binding proteins in Streptococcus suis, an important swine pathogen. Whole bacterial cells were incubated with human or pig IgG conjugated to gold particles and examined by transmission electron microscopy. Cells of some S. suis strains were labelled as were cells of the positive control strain, Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I. Binding of pig and human IgG to five different bacterial species of group D streptococci, to reference strains representing the 29 capsular types of S. suis, and to 12 S. suis capsular type 2 strains was then examined using Western blotting. All strains interacted with pig and human IgG, although the binding profiles were slightly different. A 52 kDa protein was observed in all capsular types of S. suis. This protein, absent in other group D streptococcal species, was observed in all capsular type 2 isolates originating from diseased or clinically healthy pigs, and was shown to bind human IgG-Fc fragments. The IgG-binding activity was also observed in the culture supernatant and was sensitive to proteolysis.
TI  - Population structure of Australian isolates of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - The genetic diversity of 109 isolates of Streptococcus suis, which were recovered mainly from Australian pigs, was examined by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis. The collection was genetically diverse. Sixty-five electrophoretic types (ETs) were recognized, with a mean genetic diversity per enzyme locus of 0.512, or 0.431 when the number of isolates in each ET was considered. Serotype diversity varied, being greatest for isolates of capsular serotype 15 (0.364), and then diminishing in the order of serotypes 9, 1, 4, 1/2, 2, 7, and 3 (0.120). On average, isolates from these eight serotypes represented 4.13 separate clonal groups per serotype. This diversity indicated that serotyping of S. suis for subspecific differentiation is not a reliable technique for identifying specific strains and is not a good predictor of the genetic background of a given isolate. No tendency for isolates recovered from healthy pigs to be genetically distinct from those from diseases animals was found, nor were there consistent differences between isolates recovered from animals with different disease syndromes (meningitis, pneumonia, and septicemia). Danish reference strains of serotypes 1, 2, and 7 each belonged to one of the same clonal groupings of these types found in Australia, but Danish strains of serotypes 3, 4, 6, and 8 and a strain of serotype 1 from the United Kingdom were each genetically distinct from the Australian isolates. Generally, isolates in the same ET belonged to the same serotype, but one ET contained isolates of types 6 and 6/16, and three were made up of isolates of types 2 and 1/2. One isolate of serotype 2, which was recovered from a human with meningitis, belonged to the same ET as two isolates of serotype 2 that were recovered from pigs. The human infection was therefore likely to have been zoonotic.
TI  - Isolation and distribution of Streptococcus suis capsular types from diseased pigs in Spain.
AB  - A total of 65 isolates of Streptococcus suis was recovered from various tissues of diseased pigs. Almost 96% of all these isolates could be categorized as one of capsular types 1 to 22 and 1/2. Capsular type 2 was the most prevalent and represented 53.8% of all isolates, followed by capsular types 1 (9.2%), 1/2 (7.7%) and 8 (4.6%). Brain-meninges, multiples tissues and lungs were the source of the majority of the isolates. A total of 37% of S. suis isolates, mainly from brain-meninges, were found in pure culture. The antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of S. suis isolates was determined.
TI  - The epidemiological studies of Streptococcus suis infections in Japan from 1987 to 1991.
AB  - The epidemiological studies of S. suis infections in Japan were carried out between 1987 to 1991. A total of 380 S. suis strains isolated from pigs, cattle and a horse were serotyped by using antisera against S. suis types 1 to 22. A total of 318 (83.7%) of S. suis isolates were serologically typable. Serotype 2 was the most prevalent with 28.2%, followed by type 7 (10.8%), 1/2 (8.4%), 3 (7.4%) and 4 (5.5%). Of twenty S. suis strains isolated from cattle, eight were type 9, one was type 10, five were type 18, one was type 20 and five were untypable. One out of all the strains was also isolated from a racing horse with pneumonia. The majority of the isolates were originated from meningitis (38.2%), followed by from pneumonia (33.4%) and endocarditis (9.2%). Of all of the S. suis isolates, 333 isolates (87.6%) were identified correctly by API STREP 20 system.
TI  - Use of polyvalent coagglutination reagents for serotyping of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Polyvalent coagglutination reagents (PRs) have been evaluated for the serotyping  of Streptococcus suis. Monovalent antisera produced against 28 S. suis reference strains have been grouped to obtain five different pools. A total of 249 field isolates previously identified and belonging to different serotypes were tested with PRs prepared by two different procedures: (i) monovalent coagglutination reagents were individually prepared and mixed in equal proportions, and (ii) antisera were mixed in equal proportions before the addition of the Staphylococcus aureus suspension. Only antisera tested by a tube agglutination test with 2-mercaptoethanol and presenting titers of 1:32 or higher were used. Results obtained with PRs prepared by both procedures were similar, and there was a very good correlation between the capsular type of the isolate and the reaction obtained with PRs. Thus, from a practical viewpoint, it is suggested that PRs be prepared by the first procedure. To isolates, were tested in parallel with both the PRs and the monovalent coagglutination reagents over a 1-year period. Ninety-nine percent of the typeable and all of the untypeable isolates were correctly identified. Serotyping with PRs is suggested to be a very useful and reliable screening procedure, particularly when a large number of S. suis isolates have to be serotyped. In addition, the choice of antisera to be included in a given pool is facultative and should be oriented to the needs of a region or a country.
TI  - Repeats in an extracellular protein of weakly pathogenic strains of Streptococcus suis type 2 are absent in pathogenic strains.
AB  - Streptococcus suis type 2 strains that are pathogenic for pigs produce a 110-kDa  extracellular protein factor (EF). Nonpathogenic and weakly pathogenic strains do not produce EF or produce a protein (EF*) that is immunologically related to EF. To study the pathogenesis of S. suis type 2 in pigs and to develop tools and methods for the control of S. suis type 2 infections, we cloned and characterized the genes encoding EF and various EF* proteins. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences showed that the first 833 amino acids at the N terminus of the EF and EF* proteins were nearly identical. The proteins differed, however, at their C termini. Unlike the 110-kDa EF protein, the EF* proteins contained several repeated units of 76 amino acids. The number and arrangement of the repeats in the EF* proteins varied. The data suggest that the gene encoding EF could have evolved from an epf* gene by a specific deletion event. The lack of repeated amino acid units in the EF protein may be related to virulence.
TI  - Distribution of capsular types 1 to 28 and further characteristics of Streptococcus suis isolates from various European countries.
AB  - Most of the 150 Streptococcus suis isolates from pigs and ruminants used in this  study grew under aerobic conditions and were alpha-hemolytic on sheep blood agar. Part of the cultures required an increased CO2 concentration. These cultures, representing the CO2- dependent ecovar of S. suis, were mainly beta-hemolytic on sheep and horse blood agar and gave a synergistic hemolytic reaction with staphylococcal beta-lysin. Similar to S. suis reference cultures, the routine isolates showed typical biochemical properties of this species. Few cultures, mostly those from ruminants, could be classified as the sorbitol and mannitol-positive ecovar. Formamide extracts of 81% of the cultures reacted with group D-specific antisera. Serotyping of the S. suis isolates revealed mainly capsular types 2, 1/2, 1, 5, 11, 13, 23, 3 and 15. The determination of antibiotic susceptibility revealed a high number of cultures to be resistant to clindamycin, erythromycin, kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin and tetracycline. Cultural, biochemical and serological properties together with antibiotic resistance patterns could be used to characterize individual isolates of S. suis. This could be of importance in epidemiological studies.
TI  - Effect of management practices on the Streptococcus suis carrier rate in nursery  swine.
AB  - Management practices on swine farms were analyzed to determine factor(s) associated with high prevalence of pigs that were carriers of Streptococcus suis. Samples were obtained for bacteriologic culture via direct swabbing of palatine tonsils of healthy nursery pigs on 35 farms throughout the United States. Overall, 36.7% of the pigs were determined to be carriers. Isolates of S suis were serotyped, and antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed by use of Kirby-Bauer techniques. Streptococcus suis types 1 and 2 were most commonly isolated. All isolates were susceptible to enrofloxacin, 97% of the isolates were susceptible to ceftiofur, and 94% were susceptible to ampicillin. However, only 80% of the isolates were susceptible to penicillin, and only 18% were susceptible to tetracycline. Environmental, managerial, nutritional, and health factors were measured on each farm. Excessive temperature fluctuation, high relative humidity, crowding, and an age spread of > 2 weeks between pigs in the same room were the 4 most commonly encountered problems on farms with higher-than-average percentages of carrier pigs. Continuous flow facilities were found on 50% of these farms, and various disease problems, vitamin E/selenium deficiency, inadequate vaccination programs (attributable to the presence of atypical serotypes), and penicillin-resistant strains were found on 6 to 28% of these farms. Overall, 83% (15/18) of farms with higher-than-average percentages of carrier pigs also had a history of clinical S suis disease.

TI  - Streptococcus suis infection in swine: a retrospective study of 256 cases. Part I. Epidemiologic factors and antibiotic susceptibility patterns.
AB  - A retrospective study of 256 cases of naturally acquired Streptococcus suis infections in swine submitted to the Indiana Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory from 1985 to 1989 was performed to determine the epidemiologic factors and antibiotic susceptibility patterns associated with S. suis serotypes 1-8 and 1/2. A standardized computer form was used to record the history, signalment, and clinical signs obtained from the records of selected cases and the microscopic lesions identified after review of the histopathology slides for each case. A computer statistics package (SAS) was used to evaluate the data. Although the number of recovered S. suis isolates increased in the fall and winter months, most serotypes were readily isolated throughout the year; only serotypes 1, 4, 7, and 1/2 increased in frequency of isolation in the fall, winter, and spring months. The majority (61.1%) of infected pigs in this study were < 12 weeks of age. More than 75% of pigs infected with serotypes 1, 6, 7, and 1/2 were < 12 weeks of age. There was extensive overlap in the age distributions for pigs with each serotype, and statistically significant differences for most serotypes were not observed. Fifty percent of pigs infected with S. suis serotypes 1 and 1/2 were 3-10 weeks of age, 50% of pigs infected with serotype 2 were 6-14 weeks of age, and 50% of pigs infected with serotypes 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 were 2-16 weeks of age. Isolates of S. suis were not uniformly susceptible to penicillin, and a large percentage of isolates were resistant to many antibiotics in common usage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Twenty-three cases of porcine cystitis and pyelonephritis were examined bacteriologically. Eubacterium suis was found in 21 cases. The isolation of large numbers of Escherichia coli in the upper urinary tract was associated with linear renal scarring. An unidentifiable streptococcus and Enterococcus faecalis were isolated from a case of purulent ureteritis, pyelitis and pyelonephritis. The bacterial flora from cases of cystitis and pyelonephritis was different from that isolated from sows with asymptomatic bacteriuria.
TI  - An occurrence of equine transport pneumonia caused by mixed infection with Pasteurella caballi, Streptococcus suis and Streptococcus zooepidemicus.
AB  - An acute death occurred in a racehorse with pneumonia after long-distance transportation in December, 1990. Pasteurella caballi, Streptococcus suis and Streptococcus zooepidemicus were isolated from the lung at high rate. Specific antigens of these bacteria were also demonstrated immunohistologically in the pneumonic lesion. These findings indicated that the disease is equine transport pneumonia caused by a mixed infection of the three bacterial species. This is the first report on the isolation of P. caballi and S. suis from a racehorse in Japan.

In thin-layer chromatography overlay assays the bacteria bound to trihexosylceramide (GbO3) but not to globoside (GbO4) or Forssman glycolipid (GbO5), in contrast to P-fimbriated Escherichia coli, which bound only to the latter two. The S. suis adhesin also differed from that of E. coli in that some of the hydrogen bonds formed with the receptor, as determined with chemically modified receptor analogues, were different. In agreement with the binding specificity, the S. suis bacteria agglutinated best among P blood group erythrocytes those of the P1k and P2k type, and from different animal erythrocytes those from rabbit, which express GbO3 as the predominant glycolipid. Binding to frozen sections of pig pharyngeal tissue was decreased by the free GbO3 oligosaccharide and its protein conjugate, which indicated that the corresponding glycolipid may function as receptor for galactose-binding strains of S. suis in pig pharyngeal epithelium.
TI  - The carriage of Streptococcus suis type 2 by pigs in Papua New Guinea.
AB  - An indirect fluorescent antibody test was used to detect the presence of Streptococcus suis type 2 in nasal and pharyngeal swabs taken from pigs in Papua New Guinea. The rate of carriage for the two sites in domesticated indigenous village pigs was 0.5 and 2.5% respectively, compared to 39 and 43% for intensively reared pigs. These findings were supported by the results of a serological survey, using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, in which 87% of intensively reared pigs but only 8% of village pigs were seropositive to S. suis type 2. It is proposed that in intensive piggeries S. suis type 2 is continually cycled between pigs. In village pigs, the low population density and harsh environmental conditions prevents this cycle of infection.
TI  - Streptococci and enterococci associated with tonsils of cattle.
AB  - Streptococcus suis, Streptococcus bovis and the mastitis pathogens Streptococcus  dysgalactiae and Streptococcus uberis were the most frequently occurring streptococci in tonsils of cattle. Streptococcus suis dominated in samples from calves between 1 month and 1 year of age, but was much less frequent in calves less than 1 month old. The mastitis pathogen Strep. dysgalactiae was found more often in calves than in older animals. Enterococci were relatively rare, except in the youngest age group. Nearly one third of the strains examined could not be identified to known species.
TI  - Discrimination between virulent and nonvirulent Streptococcus suis type 2 strains by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
AB  - Discrimination between virulent and nonvirulent strains of Streptococcus suis type 2 will allow proper diagnosis of diseased pigs and the identification of carrier pigs. To discriminate between virulent and nonvirulent strains, we developed two double antibody sandwich (DAS) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) using specific monoclonal antibodies directed against two virulence markers of S. suis type 2. One mAb was directed against the 136-kilodalton (kDa) cell-wall-associated protein, designated muramidase-released-protein (MRP). The other mAb was directed against a 110-kDa extracellular protein, provisionally called extracellular factor (EF). We examined 179 strains of S. suis serotype 2, 22 strains of S. suis serotypes 1 to 22, 22 other streptococci, 20 other bacterial strains, and one yeast. The ELISA results were almost identical with western blot analysis of these strains. Visual readings of the two DAS-ELISAs were enough to discriminate accurately between the three phenotypes of S. suis type 2. We concluded that the two DAS-ELISAs are reliable, rapid, and simple assays to identify virulent strains of S. suis type 2.
TI  - Production of capsular material by Streptococcus suis serotype 2 under different  growth conditions.
AB  - The procedure currently used for the production of Streptococcus suis antigen is  very long and includes several subcultures. The aim of the present work was to study the in vitro production of capsular material by S. suis serotype 2 after each of these subcultures. The amount of capsular material produced was evaluated by electron microscopy using bacterial cells grown on blood-agar plates and in Todd-Hewitt broth (THB) or THB supplemented with serum. In addition, the production of antibodies in rabbits with antigens produced using different growth conditions was compared. Antigens produced after only three subcultures possessed as much capsular material as cells obtained after the complete procedure and induced a similar antibody response. The use of serum as a supplement to the broth did not assure a higher production of capsule; in addition, antibody titers obtained with antigens produced in THB were as high as those obtained with antigens produced in THB supplemented with serum. We recommend the use of three subcultures in nonsupplemented broth for the production of immunogens. This revised protocol offers two main advantages: it is less time-consuming because of the limited number of subcultures and is also less expensive since nonsupplemented broths are used.
TI  - A sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - A double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for the detection and the identification of Streptococcus suis capsular types 1, 2, 1/2, 3 and 22. The specificity of this test was first evaluated using reference strains of S. suis capsular types 1 to 28 and 1/2 as well as 15 different bacterial species susceptible to be isolated from swine. The ELISA developed was very specific for capsular types 1, 3 and 22 but it could not discriminate between capsular types 2 and 1/2. In a second study, S. suis isolates from 328, 493, 368 and 76 diseased pigs were used to detect capsular types 1, 2 or 1/2, 3 and 22 respectively. The relative specificity and sensitivity varied between 98% and 100%. The ELISA results were in excellent agreement with the standard techniques (biochemical tests, coagglutination and capsular reaction tests) in detecting both positive and negative strains. Kappa values were 0.80, 0.99, 0.97 and 1.00 for detecting S. suis capsular types 1, 2 or 1/2, 3, and 22 respectively. To evaluate the relative-sensitivity of the test, primary cultures from 73 diseased pigs and tissue samples from 67 diseased pigs were used directly for detecting these capsular types. With primary cultures, the relative specificity and sensitivity (95.9% and 91.6% respectively) remained high and the test was very suitable (Kappa = 0.87). The ELISA using tissue samples gave a good specificity (97.6%), a moderate sensitivity (62.5%) and a low agreement with standard tests (Kappa = 0.64).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Studies on a murine model for evaluation of virulence of Streptococcus suis capsular type 2 isolates.
AB  - Five different parameters, time of incubation of the culture, type of culture medium, inoculum, strain of inbred mice, and age of mice, were tested using the LD50 technique to standardize a murine model for the evaluation of the virulence of Streptococcus suis capsular type 2 isolates. A model using 28 day-old mice belonging to CF1 strain appeared to give the best results. The inoculum size was the parameter most influencing the 50% lethal dose obtained with mice. Inoculation with 1-ml volume of a bacterial suspension instead of 0.1 or 0.5 ml decreased the LD50. The standardized model was used to evaluate the virulence of some isolates of known pathogenicity for pigs. The minimum lethal dose was used in the model and it appeared that the virulence of Streptococcus suis capsular type 2 isolates can be measured from highly virulent to totally avirulent.
TI  - [Acute mortality in pigs caused by Streptococcus suis type 1].
AB  - In early 1991 many young pigs died without clinical signs on a farm in the Province of Utrecht. This article describes the isolation of Streptococcus suis type 1 after postmortem examination of the piglets.
TI  - Molecular analysis of isolates of Streptococcus suis capsular type 2 by restriction-endonuclease-digested DNA separated on SDS-PAGE and by hybridization with an rDNA probe.
AB  - This study was undertaken to assess the discriminatory value of restriction endonuclease (RE) digestion patterns of Streptococcus suis chromosomal DNA using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and DNA-rDNA hybridization. For the RE digestion patterns, DNAs were digested separately with the enzymes BamHI and BglII and the resultant fragments were separated by SDS-PAGE. An Escherichia coli rDNA probe derived from pKK3535 was used for the hybridization. Twenty-three S. suis capsular type 2 isolates recovered from diseased and clinically healthy pigs, from a human case, and from a cow were compared in this study. The majority of isolates associated with septicaemia belonged to one restriction endonuclease analysis (REA) profile group. Isolates associated with pneumonia belonged either to the REA profile group of isolates associated with septicaemia or to a second REA profile group. The REA profiles of isolates from clinically healthy animals were more heterogeneous. The REA profile of the type 2 reference strain, S735, which was originally isolated from a pig, was very different from those of the porcine and bovine isolates but similar to the profile of the human isolate. The profiles obtained after rDNA hybridization were more homogeneous. Although different patterns were detected in the 23 isolates, there was no correlation between the source of the isolate and the patterns observed with this technique.
TI  - Identification and composition of the tonsillar and anal enterococcal and streptococcal flora of dogs and cats.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis was the most frequently isolated enterococcal species from  anal swabs and tonsils of dogs and cats, although in the anal samples from dogs Ent. hirae was found almost as often as Ent. faecalis. Most Ent. faecium strains from dog tonsils differed from those associated with humans and other animals in that they fermented sorbitol. Typical Ent. avium as well as atypical Ent. avium-like strains were seen in dogs, while the related species Ent. raffinosus was associated with cat tonsils. Enterococcus cecorum also occurred mainly in cats. Certain atypical strains, presumptively identified as Ent. cecorum, shared characteristics with Ent. columbae. The most frequent streptococcal species in tonsils of cats and dogs were Streptococcus suis and Strep. canis. Streptococcus canis and Strep. bovis predominated in anal swabs. The canine Strep. suis differed from the common porcine strains in fermenting mannitol. Forty-seven of the 288 isolates examined could not be identified or related to known species. The characteristics of two groups of these bacteria, provisionally called 'Ton 31 group' and 'O7 group' are described.
TI  - Streptococcus suis meningitis. A severe noncompensated occupational disease.
AB  - Meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis type 2, a rare disease first recognized in 1968 (108 cases worldwide in 1989), is contracted by occupational exposure to pigs and often results in very severe disabilities (definitive deafness and ataxia in 50% of cases). We report the case of an employee in a rendering plant whose initial symptom was deafness. A detailed analysis of medical and veterinary literature is provided concerning the epidemiology of the disease, the clinical forms in man, bacteriological diagnosis and the role of the pig as healthy carrier. It is recommended that this occupational disease be officially recognized for compensation in France.
TI  - Identification of N-acetylneuraminyl alpha 2-->3 poly-N-acetyllactosamine glycans as the receptors of sialic acid-binding Streptococcus suis strains.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is a common cause of sepsis, meningitis, and other serious infections in young piglets and also causes meningitis in humans. The cell-binding specificity of sialic acid-recognizing strains of Streptococcus suis was investigated. Treatment of human erythrocytes with sialidase or mild periodate abolished hemagglutination. Hemagglutination inhibition experiments with sialyl oligosaccharides indicated that the adhesin preferred the sequence NeuNAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-4Glc(NAc). Resialylation of desialylated erythrocytes with Gal beta 1-3(4)GlcNAc alpha 2-3-sialyltransferase induced a strong hemagglutination, whereas no or only weak hemagglutination was obtained with cells resialylated with two other sialyltransferases. Binding of radiolabeled bacteria to blots of erythrocyte membrane proteins revealed binding to the poly-N-acetyllactosamine-containing components Band 3, Band 4.5, and polyglycosyl ceramides and to glycophorin A. The involvement of glycophorin A as a major ligand was excluded by the strong hemagglutination of trypsin-treated erythrocytes and En(a-) erythrocytes defective in glycophorin A. Sensitivity of the hemagglutination toward endo-beta-galactosidase treatment of erythrocytes and inhibition by purified poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl glycopeptides indicated that the adhesin bound to glycans containing the following structure: NeuNAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-.
TI  - Culture media for enterococci and group D-streptococci.
AB  - Lancefield group D-streptococci are contaminants of various food commodities, especially those of animal origin. They encompass the new genus Enterococcus comprising 13 known species and some species of streptococci which have their habitat in the intestine of animals, e.g. Streptococcus bovis, suis and equinus. The serologically based grouping may no longer constitute the best definition for streptococci from the food chain. Food hygiene monitoring systems using enterococci as indicators need reliable methods for selective cultivation and identification of marker strains. Up to now more than 100 modifications of selective media have been described for isolating streptococci or enterococci from various specimens. The selection of a medium requires either experience or consultation. It depends on the kind of specimen, the method of cultivation (plate count or membrane filter) and whether or not the habitat is heavily contaminated with other organisms. The choice of media is made more difficult as commercial versions of the same culture medium may vary in recipe and/or performance from producer to producer. Therefore, reviewing the literature may help in the choice of medium and confirmation tests. The selectivity and productivity of some commonly used or cited media are reported here, partly based on our own experience: citrate azide tween carbonate agar (CATC), kanamycin aesculin azide agar (KAA) and M-enterococcus agar (ME) including earlier results with aesculin bile azide agar (ABA), and thallous acetate tetrazolium glucose agar (TITG). No medium was completely selective for all group D-streptococci or for all enterococci but some media were highly selective for a single Enterococcus species, e.g., for E. faecalis which serves as indicator of human pollution. Confirmatory tests must be carried out when experience in the evaluation procedure is limited. Selective media for enterococci should be used only after or while checking in parallel their selectivity and productivity against appropriate test organisms.
TI  - Testing meningeal strains of Streptococcus suis to detect M protein genes.
AB  - Previous reports have suggested that the surface proteins found in meningeal strains of Streptococcus suis might be similar to the M protein of group A streptococci. Fifty-five strains of S suis, including human and swine meningeal and pneumonic isolates, were tested for M protein genes by DNA probes representing the constant domain of the 3' end of the group A, M protein gene. None of the S suis strains examined was positive, indicating that these organisms either lack M protein genes or harbour different genes, not expressing the constant domains of protein M from group A.

TI  - Cloning and nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the 136-kilodalton surface protein (muramidase-released protein) of Streptococcus suis type 2.
AB  - We cloned and sequenced the gene encoding the muramidase-released protein (MRP) of a pathogenic Streptococcus suis type 2 strain to determine whether its amino acid sequence resembles that of proteins with known functions and to determine its function in virulence. The complete nucleotide sequence composing the gene and the regions flanking it was determined. The deduced amino acid sequence revealed the presence of a signal peptide at the N terminus and a cell envelope anchor at the C terminus, both of which resembled similar regions in several other surface proteins from gram-positive bacteria. The processed form of MRP has a length of 1,209 amino acids and a calculated molecular weight of 131,094. A highly repetitive region preceded the envelope anchor. The repeated units were preceded by a proline-rich stretch of amino acids (26 of 86). No overall homologies were observed between the amino acid sequence of MRP and protein sequences in the EMBL data bank. A particular region within the amino acid sequence, however, showed some similarity with the fibronectin-binding protein of Staphylococcus aureus. Binding of MRP to human fibronectin, however, could not be confirmed.

TI  - Antimicrobial resistance patterns and plasmid profiles of Streptococcus suis isolates.
AB  - Streptococcus suis isolates recovered from diseased animals in Quebec and western Canada and from human cases in Europe were tested for their susceptibility to different antimicrobial agents and screened for their plasmid content. Most isolates from Quebec were clindamycin, erythromycin, and tetracycline resistant; animal isolates from western Canada were notably less resistant to clindamycin and erythromycin, whereas human isolates were considerably more susceptible to most antimicrobials tested. More than 60% of isolates had plasmids that ranged from 1.5 to 35 kilobases (kb). Of the 7 plasmid profiles found, 2 were particularly frequent in isolates from Quebec and western Canada, suggesting the presence of epidemic strains in the swine population. A particular plasmid band of about 5 kb was present in most Canadian isolates. When this band was used as a probe in colony and Southern blot hybridization, most isolates harboring the 5-kb plasmid hybridized, even though their plasmid profiles were different. Human isolates from Europe differed in their plasmid content from Canadian isolates of animal origin. Although a high degree of antimicrobial resistance was associated with the presence of plasmids in most isolates, it was not possible to establish a causative relationship.
TI  - Inoculation of pigs with Streptococcus suis type 2 alone or in combination with pseudorabies virus.
AB  - Pigs (9 [+/- 1] weeks old) were inoculated with Streptococcus suis type 2, pseudorabies virus (PRV), or both. For each pig of groups A, B, and C the inoculum of S suis was 10(9) colony-forming units. For each pig of groups A, B, and D the inoculum of PRV was 5 x 10(3) TCID50 of either PRV strain 4892 (group A, n = 9) or PRV isolate B (group B, n = 9). The PRV strain 4892 is a highly virulent strain; isolate B causes mild clinical signs of infection in inoculated pigs. Group-C pigs (n = 9) were given S suis alone, and group-D pigs (n = 3) were inoculated only with PRV isolate B. Clinical signs of infection and development of lesions were readily seen in pigs of groups A, B, and C. Duration and severity of clinical signs of disease and lesions were reduced in pigs of group C, compared with those of the other 2 groups. Lesions, such as polyarthritis and fibrinous pericarditis, were more abundant and acute in the groups of pigs given mixed challenge exposure, compared with pigs inoculated exclusively with S suis type 2 (group C). The group of pigs inoculated with PRV isolate B alone did not manifest clinical signs of disease or lesions. Average daily gain for group-C pigs was higher, compared with that of other groups; the difference was statistically significant at P less than 0.02 and P less than 0.05 for groups B and D, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Phenoxymethyl penicillin potassium as an in-feed medication for pigs with streptococcal meningitis.
AB  - In two separate studies involving 2500 weaner pigs, strategic infeed medication with phenoxymethyl penicillin potassium significantly reduced the incidence of streptococcal meningitis.
TI  - Virulence of Streptococcus suis type 2 strains in newborn germfree pigs depends on phenotype.
AB  - To determine whether the virulence of Streptococcus suis type 2 is associated with the phenotype of the strain, we infected newborn germfree pigs with 10 strains of S. suis type 2 categorized by three phenotypes. In an earlier study, the phenotypes were distinguished by the presence or absence of the muramidase-released protein (MRP) and an extracellular factor (EF) and were designated MRP+ EF+, MRP+ EF- and MRP- EF-. Pigs were first inoculated with Bordetella bronchiseptica to predispose them to infection and were then intranasally inoculated with the streptococci. Strains of the MRP+ EF+ phenotype induced fever and increased the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in blood. Specific clinical signs of disease such as nervous disorders and lameness were also observed. At necropsy bacteriologic and pathologic examination disclosed meningoencephalitis, polyserositis, and polyarthritis. Strains of the MRP+ EF- phenotype induced only nonspecific clinical signs of disease such as recumbency, lack of appetite, and fever; only slight pathologic changes were detected in the serosae. The four strains of the MRP- EF- phenotype induced no signs of disease. These findings indicate that the 110-kDa EF and, to a lesser degree, the 136-kDa MRP may be associated with the virulence of the bacterium. The results demonstrated that S. suis type 2 strains producing both MRP and EF are pathogenic for pigs.
TI  - Conjugation of antibiotic resistance in Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Forty-eight clinical isolates of Streptococcus suis were examined for antibiotic  sensitivity and the presence of plasmid DNA. It was determined that isolates from this study showed a substantial increase in resistance to erythromycin (ery), clindamycin, and tetracycline (tet) compared to a similar study conducted five years earlier. Eleven of the 48 isolates contained plasmid DNA as revealed by DNA isolation and gel electrophoresis. Plasmid DNA from four strains resistant to the above three antibiotics was tested for the ability to transform an antibiotic sensitive recipient. No transformation of antibiotic resistance could be demonstrated. In other experiments, the above four strains, along with four plasmid-negative triply resistant strains were tested for the ability to transfer tet or ery resistance to tet and ery sensitive recipients by conjugation. In each mating, antibiotic resistance was transferred at frequencies averaging 2.4 x 10(-6) recombinants/recipient for ery and 3.4 x 10(-6) recombinants/recipient for tet resistance. DNA from each clinical specimen, as well as the recombinants mentioned above was probed with tn916. Autoradiographs revealed that several clinical isolates and recombinants bound the probe. It is concluded that conjugation of antibiotic resistance in these clinical strains is possibly mediated by a transposon similar to tn916.
TI  - Distribution of Streptococcus suis capsular types in Quebec and western Canada.
AB  - Of a total of 561 isolates of Streptococcus suis recovered from various tissues of diseased pigs, 464 were from veterinary laboratories in Quebec and 97 were from western Canada, particularly Alberta (84). Almost 83% of all these isolates belonged to the 23 known S. suis capsular types. There was no marked difference between the two groups of isolates. Capsular type 2 was the most prevalent and represented 32% of all isolates. The other important capsular types were, in decreasing order, 3, 1/2, 8 and 4. Lungs, brain, and meninges were the source of the majority of isolates. More than 40% of all S. suis isolates were found in pure culture. The number of isolations of this microorganism was higher in piglets aged five to eight weeks than in any other age group.
TI  - An investigation of bacterial causes of arthritis in slaughter hogs.
AB  - Joints from 153 arthritic and 80 normal slaughter hogs were examined by culture for presence of bacteria. Although none of the normal joints yielded bacteria, 37% of the disease joints were positive for bacterial growth. Of 67 bacterial isolates obtained, 45% were Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae. Occurrence of other bacteria in order of their frequency was Streptococcus suis (16%), Actinomyces pyogenes (10%), Mycoplasma spp. including 3 M. hyorhinis isolates (7%), staphylococci (7%), Streptococcus spp. (6%), and organisms of uncertain significance (7%).
TI  - Production and characterization of two Streptococcus suis capsular type 2 mutants.
AB  - Two avirulent mutants of Streptococcus suis capsular type 2 (M2 and M42) were produced from a highly virulent strain. Mutant M2, obtained after serial subcultures of the parent strain in the presence of rabbit anti-capsular type 2 serum, no longer possessed the type-specific capsular antigen, as demonstrated by serotyping methods and immunoelectron microscopy. The Lancefield group D antigen could not be detected on the cell surface of this mutant using the immunogold labelling technique. SDS-PAGE of lysozyme treated cells demonstrated that a 44 kDa protein which was present in the parent strain, was absent in mutant M2. Immunoblotting using rabbit whole cell homologous anti-serum revealed that the protein was strongly immunogenic. Mutant M2 was totally avirulent in mice, and the homologous antiserum completely failed to protect mice against challenge with the parent strain. However, mutant M42, obtained after passages of the parent strain at 42 degrees C, remained capsulated but lacked the same 44 kDa protein as mutant M2. The quantity of sialic acid present in the capsule was similar to that of the parent strain. Despite the presence of antibodies against the capsule, antiserum prepared against M42 only partially protected mice against a challenge with the parent strain. The 44 kDa cell wall protein could act as a virulence factor as well as an important immunogen of S. suis capsular type 2.
TI  - The site of the lesion causing hearing loss in bacterial meningitis: a study of experimental streptococcal meningitis in guinea-pigs.
AB  - The pathological basis of hearing loss in bacterial meningitis was investigated using an animal model of Streptococcus suis meningitis. Forty guinea-pigs were infected after their hearing had been assessed by brain stem auditory evoked potentials. In 17 animals, it was possible to repeat the procedure at the onset of meningitis; this included one animal with subclinical disease. Fifteen animals showed evidence of hearing loss, which on subsequent histological examination was found to be associated invariably with suppurative labyrinthitis. The remaining two animals without hearing loss had normal cochleas. It is suggested that cochlear sepsis rather than eighth cranial nerve involvement by meningeal sepsis is primarily responsible for hearing loss in bacterial meningitis, and that bacteria enter the cochlea via the cochlear aqueduct and not the internal auditory canal. The tissue within the lumen of the cochlear aqueduct may act as a barrier against invasion by micro-organisms, and haemolytic streptococci could cause lysis of this barrier by the exotoxins they produce.
TI  - Experimental infections of mice and pigs with Streptococcus suis type 2.
AB  - Five inbred strains of mice were tested for their susceptibility to Streptococcus suis type 2 including the type strain, two isolates from meningitis in pigs and two isolates from tonsils of clinically healthy pigs. C57BL/6, ICR and ddY strain mice showed lower susceptibility to all strains of S. suis type 2 than BALB/c and SS strain mice. The type strain and the isolates from diseased pigs produced septicaemia and meningitis in BALB/c and SS mice inoculated with 10(8) colony forming unit of the bacteria and 60 to 100% of these infected mice died. On the other hand, mice inoculated with the isolates from healthy pigs showed mild clinical signs but none of them died. In BALB/c mice which died or developed nervous signs, the purulent meningo-encephalitis, myocarditis, ophthalmitis, labyrinthitis and otitis media were observed. S. suis type 2 antigen was demonstrated in these lesions by immunoperoxidase staining using rabbit S. suis type 2 antiserum. These results were similar to those in the experimentally infected pigs with these virulent and avirulent strains against mice. These results indicate that BALB/c and SS strains of mice are useful as an experimental model of S. suis type 2 infections in pigs, and that there are virulent and avirulent strains against mice and pigs among the strains of S. suis type 2.

TI  - Characterization of six new capsular types (23 through 28) of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Six new capsular types of Streptococcus suis (types 23 to 28) are described. All  reference strains were isolated from diseased pigs and were morphologically and biochemically similar to previously described capsular types 1 to 22. Clear and specific reactions were obtained for each of the new capsular types with three different typing techniques; no cross-reactions were detected among them or with other S. suis capsular types. Their capsular material presented similar ultrastructural characteristics, as shown by electron microscopy, and fimbriae similar to those described for other capsular types of S. suis were observed. When untypeable field isolates were tested with antisera raised against the six new capsular types, capsular type 23 appeared to be the most prevalent, representing more than 50% of all these isolates. Most isolates were recovered from cases of pneumonia, septicemia, and meningitis. Presumptive biochemical identification described for S. suis capsular types 1 to 22 may also be used for capsular types 23 to 28.
TI  - Intrageneric structure of Streptococcus based on comparative analysis of small-subunit rRNA sequences.
AB  - The partial 16S rRNA sequences of 24 Streptococcus species were determined by reverse transcription. A comparative analysis of these sequences and the sequences of seven previously studied streptococcal species revealed the presence of several clusters within the genus. The clusters obtained from the sequence analysis agreed in general with the groups outlined on the basis of the results of nucleic acid hybridization studies, but there were some exceptions. The pyogenic group was extended to include Streptococcus agalactiae, S. parauberis, S. porcinus, and S. uberis. Four oral groups were discerned; these four groups centered on S. mutans, S. salivarius, S. anginosus, and S. oralis. Some species (e.g., S. suis and S. acidominimus) did not cluster with any particular group. Our findings are discussed in the context of data from other genetic and chemotaxonomic studies.
TI  - Identification of two proteins associated with virulence of Streptococcus suis type 2.
AB  - The protein profiles of various cell fractions of 180 strains of Streptococcus suis type 2, which were isolated from diseased pigs, from healthy pigs when they were slaughtered, and from human patients, were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. The isolates from diseased pigs contained two proteins that were absent in most of the isolates from healthy pigs. One of these proteins was a 136-kDa protein that was previously identified as the muramidase-released protein (MRP). This protein was predominantly detected in protoplast supernatants and culture supernatants. The second protein was a 110-kDa protein that was detected only in culture supernatants and therefore was provisionally called extracellular factor (EF). Three phenotypes of S. suis type 2 strains were recognized. Isolates from organs of diseased pigs mainly belonged to the MRP+ EF+ phenotype (77%), while isolates from tonsils of healthy pigs mainly had the MRP- EF- phenotype (86%). Most of the isolates from human patients contained MRP (89%); 74% had the MRP+ EF- phenotype. These findings confirm the results of previous investigations which demonstrated that S. suis type 2 strains differ in virulence. Monoclonal antibodies raised against the 110-kDa EF recognized proteins with higher molecular weights in culture supernatants of all of the strains with the MRP+ EF- phenotype. However, none of the strains with the MRP+ EF+ phenotype produced these high-molecular-weight proteins. Our results demonstrate that MRP and EF are associated with virulence. This suggests that one or both of these proteins are virulence factors that play a role in the pathogenesis of S. suis type 2 infections in pigs and human patients.
TI  - Detection of Streptococcus suis type 2 in tonsils of slaughtered pigs using improved selective and differential media.
AB  - New selective and differential media were devised for the isolation and identification of Streptococcus suis type 2. The selective medium (NNCC) agar) was Todd-Hewitt broth containing 1.5% Bactoagar and 5% defibrinated sheep blood with addition of sodium azide (50 micrograms/ml), nalidixic acid (25 micrograms/ml), colistin (12.5 micrograms/ml) and crystal violet (2 micrograms/ml). The differential medium consisted of heart infusion agar and antiserum specific only for S. suis type 2. In a total of 291 pigs tested by a combination of these media, S. suis type 2 was isolated and confirmed from 40 of them (13.7%).
TI  - Beta-hemolytic streptococci from pigs: bacteriological diagnosis.
AB  - Beta-hemolytic streptococci from lesions in pigs were identified as S. dysgalactiae biotype "equisimilis" and S. dysgalactiae serovar L, S. porcinus, S. agalactiae, E. faecalis and CO2 dependent and broad beta-hemolytic S. suis. Data are provided which can be used in the interpretation of commercial identification systems. Tests results and physiological characteristics which complete identification procedures using coagglutination tests are proposed and discussed.
TI  - A longitudinal study of natural infection of piglets with Streptococcus suis types 1 and 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis types 1 and 2 were detected in nasal swabs taken from five litters of piglets sampled twice weekly from birth. The two types had been detected in all pigs by the time they were 38 and 25 days old respectively with mean ages of first detectable infection being 13.5 and 8.5 days. The prevalence of infection was not affected by housing conditions or the population density of pigs. Piglets originating from a sow with vaginal swabs positive for S. suis type 2 were infected earlier than piglets from non-vaginal carriers. It is concluded that infection of piglets with S. suis type 2 may occur during the birth process.
TI  - Colonization of the pharyngeal tonsil and respiratory tract of the gnotobiotic pig by a toxigenic strain of Pasteurella multocida type D.
AB  - Seven-day-old gnotobiotic pigs were inoculated intranasally with Pasteurella multocida and euthanatized 2, 5, 9, and 14 days after inoculation. Tissues from the oropharynx and respiratory tract of pigs were cultured quantitatively and analyzed microscopically. Pigs remained afebrile and alert, except one that died of acute fibrinopurulent pneumonia. Pasteurella multocida was isolated in greatest numbers from the pharyngeal tonsils, but only in low numbers from turbinate, trachea, lung, spleen, and liver. Significant histologic changes were limited to the tonsil. Infected pigs developed mild tonsillitis with lymphocytic hyperplasia, and accumulation of cell debris and bacteria in crypts. Capsular antigens of P. multocida, identified on tissue sections with rabbit anti-capsular polysaccharide antibody and immunocytochemical reagents, were confined to the crypt lumen. Ultrastructurally, bacteria were free within crypt material or within phagosomes of macrophages or neutrophils. In a second experiment, 5-day-old pigs were infected with Streptococcus suis type 2, followed by toxigenic Pasteurella multocida at 7 days of age; one pig died of streptococcal septicemia. Pigs developed a mild tonsillitis, and both bacteria were cultured from the tonsillar crypts for up to 14 days after infection. These studies show that a toxigenic strain of Pasteurella multocida, which is a causative agent of atrophic rhinitis, can colonize the tonsil and respiratory tract of gnotobiotic pigs for up to 14 days. In addition, colonization can occur concurrently with Streptococcus suis type 2.
TI  - Adherence of Streptococcus suis capsular type 2 to porcine lung sections.
AB  - The present study was undertaken to evaluate the ability of 33 Streptococcus suis capsular type 2 isolates to adhere to frozen sections of porcine lung. Twenty isolates originated from diseased pigs and 13 from the nasal cavities of clinically healthy pigs. All isolates from diseased animals adhered to lung sections; isolates from pneumonia adhered, in general, in greater numbers than isolates from meningitis. Only four isolates from clinically healthy animals showed a weak adherence to lung sections. Hydrophobic surface properties were also evaluated. All isolates tested appeared to possess a hydrophilic cell surface. The thickness of the capsular material correlated well with the degree of adherence. However, when the adherence capacity of a noncapsulated mutant was compared with that of the parent strain, it was found that the mutant strain had at least the same adherence capacity as the capsulated parent strain. The data suggest that S. suis capsular type 2 isolates involved in pathological conditions can adhere to porcine lung tissue. The adherence activity does not seem to involve hydrophobic interactions. The amount of capsular material seems to influence the adherence activity, but is probably not the only mechanism involved.

TI  - Identification of epidemic strains of Streptococcus suis by genomic fingerprinting.
AB  - A natural outbreak of Streptococcus suis meningitis in two closed swine herds was studied. DNA fingerprinting, serotyping, and biochemical profiles were assessed. Multiple serotypes were recovered from these herds. In farm A, 50 S. suis strains were isolated from 330 swabs collected. Eighteen strains belonged to serotype 2, and 32 strains belonged to serotypes 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 11. In farm B, 16 S. suis strains were recovered from a total of 70 samples. Eight strains belonged to serotype 7 and eight belonged to serotypes 2, 3, 5, and 8. In each epidemiological situation, a single strain characterized by a distinctive restriction fragment pattern predominated among affected penmates. The epidemic serotype 2 strain was detected in farm A in weaned pigs between the ages of 5 and 7 weeks. In contrast, the pathogenic strain in farm B belonged to serotype 7 and was isolated from pigs up to 3 weeks of age. The results from both farms strongly suggest a lateral spread of these organisms. No vertical transmission could be shown in either herd. It was concluded that genomic fingerprinting is an appropriate method to distinguish outbreak isolates of S. suis from nonoutbreak strains, within the same serotype or from epidemiologically unrelated clusters of strains.
TI  - Evaluation of methods used for detecting Streptococcus suis type 2 in tonsils, and investigation of the carrier state in pigs.
AB  - Streptococcus suis type 2 was isolated from the tonsils of 143 (76 per cent) of 188 pigs from three herds by culturing on media containing a specific antiserum. Culture of frozen sections of tonsillar tissue was more sensitive than culture of swabs or deep scrapes. The specificity of an indirect fluorescent antibody test for identifying S suis type 2 in mixed cultures was conservatively estimated to be 0.89. The level of infection in one herd without a history of meningitis was lower than in two herds which had experienced repeated outbreaks. Differences between herds in the level of infection were due to differences in the number of organisms carried by pigs, more so than differences in the detectable carrier rate.
TI  - Superoxide dismutases of pathogenic and non-pathogenic Streptococcus suis type 2  isolates.
AB  - Pathogenic and non-pathogenic isolates of Streptococcus suis type 2 were screened to determine whether differences in superoxide dismutase (SOD) synthesis could explain the observed differences in their pathogenicity and intracellular fate in macrophages. A single band of SOD activity of similar Rf value was visualised in PAGE gels in all isolates and inhibition studies suggested that the cofactor present was manganese. There was no correlation between specific SOD activity and virulence. It is unlikely, therefore, that SOD produced by S. suis type 2 mediates intracellular survival of pathogenic isolates in macrophages.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of Streptococcus suis capsular types 9-22.
AB  - The incidence and biochemical patterns of Streptococcus suis capsular types 9-22  are presented. Of 148 untypeable (with types 1-8 antisera) isolates of S. suis recovered from diseased pigs, 10% were not capsulated. Of the remaining 134 isolates, only 53% belonged to capsular types 9-22; capsular types 22 and 9 were the most prevalent, representing 19% and 13%, respectively. Capsular type 15 (de Moor's group T Streptococcus) is reported here for the first time in North America since it was described in 1963 in Europe. Of 188 untypeable isolates recovered from clinically healthy pigs, 25% were noncapsulated. Of the remaining 141 isolates, 90% belonged to the new capsular types, and 87% were identified as 1 of 4 types: 17, 18, 19, and 21. Capsular types 12 and 20 were not detected among the Canadian isolates. Almost half of strains were arginine dihydrolase-negative, and 45% fermented mannitol, which is seldom a positive test with capsular types 1-8. Although some strains were negative with salicin or trehalose, none were negative for both sugars. Only 54% of isolates tested with 1 rapid multitest system were correctly identified as S. suis. A tentative biochemical profile that might be used with a microplate identification system is also presented. Biochemical identification using the conventional system instead of the rapid multitest system is preferable.
TI  - Characteristics of different Streptococcus suis ecovars and description of a simplified identification method.
AB  - Streptococcus suis strains associated with different animal hosts or located in different body regions constitute special ecovars of S. suis. A group of CO2-dependent strains which showed several unusual traits was found in the genital tract of swine, and mannitol- and sorbitol-fermenting strains were isolated from sheep, cattle and horses. S. suis was found to be biochemically more heterogenous than originally described. A detailed description is given of additional characteristics of the species as well as of characters which should be modified in the species description. A simple scheme which uses the amylase and the Voges-Proskauer (acetoin) reactions for the identification of S. suis is proposed. All S. suis strains tested produced a characteristic amylase reaction on Mueller-Hinton plates or on Columbia Agar Base enriched with starch.
TI  - Fatal Streptococcus suis meningitis in man.
AB  - A case of Streptococcus suis meningitis is observed in a 39-year-old and previously healthy meat factory worker. Neurological recovery was incomplete despite adequate and sustained antimicrobial therapy. Early deafness was demonstrated by brainstem auditory evoked potentials. Death due to aspiration pneumonia, cardiac arrest and subsequent cerebral anoxia occurred late in the course of the illness.
TI  - An abattoir survey of pneumonia and pleuritis in slaughter weight swine from 9 selected herds. IV. Bacteriological findings in chronic pneumonic lesions.
AB  - A total of 855 pig lungs were collected at slaughter and evaluated macroscopically. Bacteriological examinations were carried out on tissue samples from chronic pleuropneumonic lesions (n = 196) and from chronic bronchopneumonic lesions with suppuration (n = 14). Samples from normal lung tissue (n = 22) were also included. Pasteurella multocida was isolated from 54%, Actinobacillus (Haemophilus) pleuropneumoniae from 11%, and Streptococcus spp. from 14% of the pneumonic lesions, respectively. From normal lung tissue P. multocida was isolated from 3 (14%) of the samples, A. pleuropneumoniae was not recovered and streptococci were isolated from only 1 (5%) of these samples. The above mentioned bacterial species were recovered either in pure cultures or mixed with various other microbes. A total of 109 P. multocida strains were further characterized by capsular serotyping and testing for production of dermonecrotic toxin. Ninety-nine (91%) of the strains were capsular type A 10 (9%) were type D. Out of the type A and the type D strains 94% and 90% were toxigenic, respectively. Most of the A. pleuropneumoniae strains were serotype 2. Strains of serotypes 1 and 7 were also identified. The majority of the streptococci were identified as either Streptococcus suis or Streptococcus dysgalactiae. Actinomyces pyogenes was isolated from 14% of the lesions and anaerobic bacteria from 18%, respectively. The significance of the various bacterial species in relation to the development of chronic pneumonic lesions is discussed. Special attention is paid to P. multocida, and it is concluded that this bacterial species is probably of importance for the development of both types of chronic pneumonias.
TI  - Efficacy of tiamulin against experimentally induced Streptococcus suis type-2 infection in swine.
AB  - Eighteen 4-week-old pigs were used in a study to evaluate tiamulin in drinking water for control of experimentally induced Streptococcus suis type-2 infection. Pigs in groups A and B (n = 6 pigs/group) were aerosolized with a logarithmic-growth phase culture of S suis type 2, whereas pigs in group C (n = 6 pigs) served as noninfected and nonmedicated controls. After exposure to S suis, pigs in group B were given 180 mg of tiamulin/L of drinking water for 5 days. Pigs in group B consumed more feed (P = 0.009) and gained body weight faster (P = 0.02) than did pigs in group A. Pigs in group A had higher rectal temperature (P = 0.05) for up to 7 days after S suis exposure, higher clinical sign scores (P = 0.008), higher serum cortisol concentration on days 7 and 14, higher gross lesion scores (P = 0.03), and higher microscopic lesion scores (P = 0.01) than did pigs in groups B and C. Gross and microscopic lesions in pigs of groups A and B included meningitis, pneumonia, pleuritis, pericarditis, peritonitis, and synovitis of variable severity. Streptococcus suis type 2 was recovered from tissue specimens of 2 group-A pigs and 1 group-B pig. Data indicated that tiamulin administered via drinking water significantly reduced the effects of S suis type-2 infection.
TI  - Experimental studies on the comparative infectivity and pathogenicity of Streptococcus suis type 2. II. Porcine and human isolates in laboratory animals.
AB  - Mice, rats, guinea-pigs and rabbits were inoculated with isolates of Streptococcus suis type 2. An isolate cultured from the tonsils of a healthy pig, produced disease in rabbits after intravenous inoculation but not in mice, rats or guinea-pigs. An isolate of S. suis type 2, that was pathogenic for pigs and had been cultured from a human patient with clinical disease, produced signs of neurological disease in mice, rats and rabbits following intravenous inoculation. There was an apparent dose response in mice with 31% of mice receiving more than 10(6) organisms developing clinical disease, whilst mice receiving less than this did not develop disease. There were no detectable histopathological lesions in the brains or meninges of mice with nervous signs. It is proposed that the disease in mice may mimic that reported in humans and that mice may be a useful indicator species for determining the virulence of isolates cultured from pigs.
TI  - Experimental studies on the comparative infectivity and pathogenicity of Streptococcus suis type 2. I. Porcine and human isolates in pigs.
AB  - Piglets between 1 and 40 days of age were inoculated with varying numbers and with different isolates of Streptococcus suis type 2 by the intranasal, intravenous and subarachnoid routes. Less than 100 organisms of an isolate cultured from apparently normal pigs caused subclinical infection in 1-day-old piglets after intranasal inoculation. This infection was naturally transmitted between litter mates. Intravenous inoculation of a similar isolate in 7-week-old pigs resulted in a sub-clinical bacteraemia in 3 of 8 piglets. One other piglet developed a bacteraemia 7 days after inoculation and concurrently developed signs of lameness and nervous dysfunction. Ten piglets were inoculated by the subarachnoid route with a porcine isolate and two with an isolate from a person with clinical disease. Only the latter two pigs developed the classical signs of nervous disease associated with infection by S. suis type 2. It is concluded that strains of S. suis type 2, of varying pathogenicity for both pigs and man, are endemic in New Zealand. It is suggested that the occurrence of disease is associated with both exposure to a pathogenic strain and other, as yet undetermined, secondary factors.
TI  - Characterization of prototype and clinically defined strains of Streptococcus suis by genomic fingerprinting.
AB  - A collection of Streptococcus suis strains from animal and human infections was examined for DNA-banding patterns after restriction endonuclease digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis. The endonuclease HaeIII produced the most discriminating restriction profiles among 23 serotypes studied. DNA from serotypes 9, 11, 12, and 16 was resistant to HaeIII cleavage. DNA from serotypes 9 through 16 was cleaved with HindIII and showed substantial genomic differences. We also examined 106 epidemiologically unrelated strains isolated from cases of pig meningitis or pneumonia and 5 strains isolated from cases of human meningitis in order to compare genomic fingerprinting and serotyping as epidemiological tools. Heterogeneity was found among fingerprints of serologically identical isolates, indicating genetic diversity within some serotypes. DNA fingerprints of some serotype 2 strains from different sources appeared identical, suggesting a clonal relationship among strains of this serotype. The data suggest that this technique represents an important tool for examining the natural history of disease caused by S. suis.
TI  - Infective endocarditis caused by Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Infective endocarditis caused by Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is not uncommon in pigs but is rare in human beings. We describe the case of a pig-farmer with endocarditis due to S. suis serotype 2 and in whom prolapse of the mitral valve was the predisposing cardiac lesion. Streptococcus suis, a possible cause of infective endocarditis in endemic areas, may be confused with other group D streptococci. In suspected cases a history of contact with pigs or raw pork should be sought.
TI  - Hemagglutination properties of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - A total of 49 strains (23 reference strains and 26 field isolates) of Streptococcus suis were tested for their ability to agglutinate erythrocytes from different animal species. Ten different hemagglutination patterns were established. Thirty-three strains (67%) did not agglutinate any of the erythrocytes tested; sixteen strains (33%) agglutinated erythrocytes from one or more animal species. Different strains belonging to the same capsular type presented different hemagglutination patterns. No correlation was found between the tissue origin and/or the virulence (evaluated in 4-week-old mice) of different field isolates and their hemagglutination activity. Hydrophobic surface properties were also evaluated. All S. suis strains studied appeared to possess a hydrophilic cell surface. Morphologically similar fimbriae were observed on hemagglutinating as well as on nonhemagglutinating strains of S. suis. This study provides evidence that certain strains of S. suis possess hemagglutinating properties which do not appear to involve hydrophobic interactions. The possible role of fimbriae in hemagglutination remains unclear.
TI  - Pathogenesis of meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis type 2.
AB  - The neuraxes of 26 pigs inoculated intravenously with a pathogenic isolate of Streptococcus suis type 2 and killed 17-47 h later were examined using histologic and scanning microscopic techniques. The only pathologic lesions detected in all pigs were associated with the choroid plexus: disruption of the plexus brush border, a decrease in the number of Kolmer cells, and exudation of fibrin and inflammatory cells into the ventricles. Lesions affecting the cerebral and choroid plexus endothelium, such as vasculitis, were not detected. Intracellular bacteria were demonstrated in the parenchyma of the choroid plexus, in the ventricular exudate, and within peripheral blood monocytes. Separate studies found that circulating monocytes containing phagocytosed bacteria-sized particles migrated into the cerebrospinal fluid compartment with the choroid plexus acting as a major site of cellular ingress. These observations support the concept that in the pathogenesis of meningitis, bacteria may gain access to the cerebrospinal fluid compartment in association with monocytes migrating along normal pathways.
TI  - Pathology of Streptococcal meningitis following intravenous intracisternal and natural routes of infection.
AB  - The distribution of pathological lesions present in 20 cases of naturally-occurring Streptococcus suis type 2 meningitis and 20 cases of the disease induced experimentally by intravenous or intracisternal inoculation was examined. It was found that the distribution of lesions was similar; mild lesions were present at the choroid plexuses whilst the most dense cellular accumulations were found at sites of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) efflux, such as arachnoid villi and olfactory nerve sheaths. The distribution of changes was considered to reflect the dynamics of CSF flow rather than indicate the site of entry of the organisms into the CSF compartment.
TI  - [Fulminant sepsis caused by Streptococcus suis].
AB  - A 26-year-old man, in daily contact with pigs was admitted to hospital with septic shock which appeared to be caused by Streptococcus suis type 2 infection. Despite immediate antibiotic therapy a multiple organ failure developed, with ARDS, cardiac failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation and acute renal failure. Streptococcus suis infection is a zoonosis. The bacterium can be isolated from the tonsils of a significant part of the Dutch pig population. Mainly people who are in close contact with pigs or pork become infected. Usually meningitis develops. Sepsis, as this case, is rare and often fatal.

AB  - Five bands of 44, 54, 78, 86 and 94 kD were identified by Western blot analysis of Streptococcus suis type 2 by the use of sera that were from immune or non-immune pigs and were positive or negative in bactericidal tests in vitro. These bands were cut from the gels and used as antigens to produce antisera in rabbits. Rabbit sera against the 78 and 94 kD bands were positive in bactericidal tests, and the serum against the 94 kD band also protected mice against challenge with a live pathogenic strain of S. suis type 2. The serum raised against the 78 kD band was not protective in mice and appeared to inhibit the protective effect of the 94 kD band antiserum. Rabbit sera raised against the 44, 54 and 86 kD bands were negative in bactericidal tests and failed to protect mice against challenge.

AB  
TI  - Streptococcus suis serotypes associated with disease in weaned pigs.
AB  - Streptococcus suis was recovered from 9 outbreaks of septicaemia and meningitis in weaned pigs between 1979 and 1983. Fifteen isolates from 7 outbreaks were identified as S. suis type 9, and 3 isolates from 2 outbreaks as S. suis type 2. Three further isolates of S. suis type 2 and an isolate of S. suis type 3 were recovered from cases of bronchopneumonia in weaned pigs from 4 other piggeries.
TI  - Ultrastructural study of surface components of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - The presence of capsular material on cells of nine reference strains of Streptococcus suis representing serotypes 1 to 8 and 1/2 was determined by transmission electron microscopy after polycationic ferritin labeling, immunostabilization, or fixation with a combination of glutaraldehyde and lysine. All the cells of the reference strains examined were covered with a layer of capsular material whose thickness varied between 20 to 30 nm and 350 to 375 nm when examined by immunostabilization. Capsular material from cells exposed to homologous antiserum was usually thicker than that from polycationic ferritin-labeled cells or cells fixed with glutaraldehyde-lysine. Negative staining revealed detectable surface structures on S. suis strains. All strains carried peritichous, thin, and flexible fimbriae with a diameter of approximately 2 nm and a length of up to 250 nm. This study indicated that morphological differences of surface structure exist among S. suis reference strains.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of temperature-sensitive mutants of Streptococcus  suis: efficacy trial of the mutant vaccine in mice.
AB  - A model of experimental Streptococcus suis infection was developed in young mice. Minimum lethal dose (MLD) values were calculated for four virulent serotypes (1/2, 1, 2, 3) of S. suis using this model. Temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants of S. suis serotypes 1/2 and 1-8 were isolated and characterized on the basis of their growth kinetics and reversion rates. Ts mutants of S. suis 1/2, 1, 2, and 3 were tested as vaccines against the virulent homologous and heterologous challenges in mice. The protection provided was evaluated by analyzing the clinical signs, death or survival. Homologous but not heterologous protection was noted in all mice vaccinated with the mutant strains. Ts mutants of S. suis 1/2 provided 100% protection against challenge by virulent strains of S. suis 1/2, 1, and 2.
TI  - Effects of experimentally induced Streptococcus suis infection on the pharmacokinetics of penicillin G in pigs.
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of potassium penicillin G were studied in both healthy (n =  8) and experimentally Streptococcus-suis-infected (n = 6) pigs following intramuscular administration (15,000 iu/kg). Streptococcus-suis infection was induced artificially in young cross-bred pigs by subcutaneous inoculation with 9 x 10(8) to 10(9) colony-forming units of S. suis. The rectal temperature of infected pigs was significantly increased (P less than 0.01) before penicillin G injection and this was maintained for 8 h after the drug was given. Other clinical symptoms were also present. The serum concentration-time data for penicillin were found to fit a one-compartment open model with first-order absorption in the two groups of pigs. Significant changes were not observed between healthy and diseased pigs in following parameters: A, Ka, Ke and Tmax. However, in diseased pigs, significant increases (P less than 0.01) were found in Vd and ClB, and significant decreases (P less than 0.01) in Cmax and AUC occurred. The increased body clearance (ClB) and greater apparent volume of distribution (Vd) of penicillin G could partly explain why the serum values of the drug were much lower in diseased pigs than in healthy pigs.
TI  - Relationship between intracellular survival in macrophages and pathogenicity of Streptococcus suis type 2 isolates.
AB  - Naturally-occurring Streptococcus suis type 2 meningitis affects pigs and man; experimental models of the disease have also been established in pigs and mice. A sustained, high-level bacteraemia is an important phase preceding the development of S. suis type 2 meningitis. The main cellular clearance mechanism for circulating bacteria is the resident hepatic and splenic macrophages. The interaction between various isolates of S. suis type 2 and murine macrophages was investigated to determine whether there were differences in the outcome of the interaction that would reflect observed differences in pathogenicity. Phagocytosed non-pathogenic isolates were killed whereas intracellular pathogenic organisms survived and replicated within phagosomes in the absence of anti-S. suis type 2 antibody and complement. The addition of anti-S. suis type 2 antibody and complement to macrophages containing ingested pathogenic organisms resulted in inactivation of the intracellular bacteria. Thus whilst the pathogenicity of S. suis type 2 isolates may be related to an ability to survive within macrophages, immunity to S. suis type 2 meningitis may result from anti-S. suis type 2 antibody preventing pathogenic organisms surviving within macrophages.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of selected veterinary bacterial pathogens to ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin and norfloxacin.
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, and norfloxacin were tested for approximately ten clinical isolates of each of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Actinobacillus suis, Actinomyces pyogenes, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, Haemophilus parasuis, Haemophilus somnus, Pasteurella haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Rhodococcus equi, Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus suis and Streptococcus zooepidemicus. Ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin had similar activity and were more active than norfloxacin. All isolates had an MIC of 1.0 microgram/mL or less for ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin, and these drugs had particularly marked activity against the gram-negative bacteria tested.
TI  - Prevalence of Streptococcus suis in four to eight week old clinically healthy piglets.
AB  - The study was undertaken to determine the prevalence, in the nasal cavities, of Streptococcus suis in four to eight week old clinically healthy piglets. Streptococci biochemically compatible with S. suis were isolated from 94% of piglets and 98% of farms. Of the 782 isolates submitted to serotyping, only 164 (21%) were included in the nine official serotypes. These 164 typable isolates originated from 121 (31%) of the 388 piglets and from 36 (73%) of the 49 farms included in the study. The most frequent serotypes found in piglets were, in decreasing order, 3, 4, 8 and 2. Serotype 1 was not detected in this survey. As many as 32% of piglets were found positive for two different serotypes and three different serotypes were found in 1%.
TI  - Streptococcus suis infection in swine. A sixteen month study.
AB  - A total of 349 isolates of Streptococcus suis retrieved from different tissues from diseased pigs were examined in this study. Only 48% of them could be categorized as one of serotypes 1 to 8 and 1/2. Among typable isolates, serotype 2 was the most prevalent (23%), followed by serotype 3 (10%). The majority of all isolates originated from lungs, meninges/brain, and multiple tissues. Forty-one percent of typable isolates and 33% of untypable isolates were retrieved in pure culture. Other isolates were found in conjunction with Pasteurella multocida, Escherichia coli, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Actinomyces pyogenes, and other streptococci. Typable S. suis isolates were more frequently isolated from pigs between five and ten weeks of age, while untypable isolates were mostly found in animals aged more than 24 weeks. No obvious monthly and/or seasonal variation of the prevalence of isolation of S. suis could be detected.
TI  - Immunisation of pigs with killed cultures of Streptococcus suis type 2.
AB  - Ten intravenous inoculations of 10(10) formalin-killed pathogenic Streptococcus suis type 2 stimulated detectable levels of opsonic antibody and a strong protective response against intravenous challenge with 10(9) viable S suis type 2 of the same strain. Heat-killed organisms did not stimulate a protective response, even though the type-specific antigen was intact and opsonic antibodies were induced. When the number of formalin-killed organisms in the inoculum was increased 10-fold, one inoculation was insufficient to stimulate a protective response, but two inoculations protected pigs against intravenous challenge with live, pathogenic organisms. Four-hour and overnight cultures were equally immunogenic, and the response was not enhanced by either Freund's incomplete adjuvant or aluminium hydroxide gel adjuvant.
TI  - [Deafness-blindness caused by Streptococcus suis meningitis--epidemiology and rehabilitation].
AB  - A case of blind-deafness due to Streptococcus suis meningitis is described. The high incidence of blind-deafness in this disease is emphasized. Rehabilitation problems are discussed. Special attention is given to the Lorm writing as an ideal way of revalidation in this particular patient.
TI  - Description of 14 new capsular types of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Fourteen new capsular types of Streptococcus suis (types 9 to 22) are described.  All reference strains are morphologically and biochemically similar to types previously described. Reference strain types 9 to 13, 15, 16, and 22 were isolated from diseased pigs, whereas types 17 to 19 and 21 came from clinically healthy pigs; type 14 was isolated from a human case of meningitis, and type 20 was isolated from a diseased calf. The group T streptococcus of de Moor has been included in the typing system as type 15. Two-way cross-reactions between types 6 and 16 and a one-way cross-reaction between types 2 and 22 have been demonstrated. In addition, several cross-reactions probably not due to capsular material were detected among different types by using the coagglutination test. This test should not be used alone; weak or multiple positive reactions must be confirmed by the capsular reaction test or the capillary precipitation test.

TI  - Rapid detection of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 in weaned pigs.
AB  - A survey to detect Streptococcus suis serotype 2 in 1,716 weaned pigs was done in Quebec. Forty-nine sow herds were included in this survey: in 26 herds, S suis serotype 2 had been isolated during the preceding 12 months and in 23 herds (control), the organism had not been detected during a previous study. Swab specimens of the nasal cavity and tonsils of pigs were obtained for bacteriologic culture, and S suis serotype 2 was easily detected by the use of brain-heart infusion agar containing a Streptococcus-selective supplement and 5% goat antiserum raised against S suis serotype 2. After measurement of the diameter of the precipitation zone of 539 isolates, a slide agglutination test was performed to identify the S suis serotype 2 isolates. The mean precipitation zone diameter obtained for group S suis serotype 2 was larger (P less than 0.001) than that for the group designated as "others". With slide agglutination test results as reference and on the basis of discriminant analysis to stimulate detection of S suis serotype 2, 93.1% of all isolates were correctly classified, using the precipitation zone diameter as unique classification criterion. Relative specificity was 94.5% and relative sensitivity was 88.7%. Use of the precipitation zone diameter on a quantitative basis led to the proposal of a simple and reliable technique to screen swine herds for S suis serotype 2 in weaned pigs. Nasal and tonsillar swab specimens were obtained and analyzed concurrently for S suis serotype 2. The organism was found in both sites in only 20.4% of 103 carrier pigs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity of five tetracyclines and some other antimicrobial agents against four porcine respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of five tetracyclines and ten other antimicrobial agents were determined for four porcine bacterial respiratory tract pathogens by the agar dilution method. For the following oxytetracycline-susceptible strains, the MIC50 ranges of the tetracyclines were: P. multocida (n = 17) 0.25-0.5 micrograms/ml; B. bronchiseptica (n = 20) 0.25-1.0 micrograms/ml; H. pleuropneumoniae (n = 20) 0.25-0.5 micrograms/ml; S. suis Type 2 (n = 20) 0.06-0.25 micrograms/ml. For 19 oxytetracycline-resistant P. multocida strains the MIC50 of the tetracyclines varied from 64 micrograms/ml for oxytetracycline to 0.5 micrograms/ml for minocycline. Strikingly, minocycline showed no cross-resistance with oxytetracycline, tetracycline, chlortetracycline and doxycycline in P. multocida and in H. pleuropneumoniae. Moreover, in susceptible strains minocycline showed the highest in vitro activity followed by doxycycline. Low MIC50 values were observed for chloramphenicol, ampicillin, flumequine, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against P. multocida and H. pleuropneumoniae. B. bronchiseptica was moderately susceptible or resistant to these compounds. As expected tiamulin, lincomycin, tylosin and spiramycin were not active against H. pleuropneumoniae. Except for flumequine, the MIC50 values of nine antimicrobial agents were low for S. suis Type 2. Six strains of this species showed resistance to the macrolides and lincomycin.

TI  - Monoclonal antibodies for coagglutination of Streptococcus suis type 1.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were sought that would identify Streptococcus suis.  Spleen cells from Balb/c mice immunized with formalin-killed S. suis were fused with the murine cell-line SP-2/0. Hybridomas positive for S. suis were identified by a solid-phase radioimmunoassay with a mixture of all available serotypes of S. suis. On further screening with individual serotypes of S. suis (Types 1, 2, 1/2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 12) and other related and unrelated bacteria, a hybridoma specific for Type 1 was identified. Another hybridoma was positive for all serotypes of S. suis. S. suis Type 1-specific MAbs in the form of ascites fluid was used in coagglutination test. Agglutination with S. suis Type 1 was observed within 45 s, while there was no reaction with other serotypes of S. suis or other bacteria, during the 5-min observation period. A library of type-specific MAbs should help in rapid and accurate serotyping of S. suis isolates.
TI  - Occupational exposure to Streptococcus suis type 2.
AB  - Antibody titres to Streptococcus suis type 2 were measured with an enzyme linked  immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in four occupational groups in New Zealand. No veterinary students, 9% of dairy farmers, 10% of meat inspectors and 21% of pig farmers were seropositive to S. suis type 2. The development of antibody to S. suis type 2 was associated with occupational contact with pigs or their meat products. Subclinical infection with S. suis type 2 appears to occur in humans and the antibody produced is of only short duration. The annual incidence of subclinical infection and seroconversion in pig farmers may approach 28%. Thus S. suis type 2 may be one of the most infectious potentially zoonotic agents present in New Zealand, although very rarely resulting in clinical disease.
TI  - Differences in virulence between two strains of Streptococcus suis type II after  experimentally induced infection of newborn germ-free pigs.
AB  - Fifteen newborn germ-free pigs were inoculated with 2 strains, D-282 and T-15, of Streptococcus suis type II. Some pigs also were preinoculated with Bordetella bronchiseptica, which successfully predisposed them to S suis infection. The 2 streptococcal strains were differentiated by muramidase treatment, which released certain high molecular-weight proteins, termed muramidase-released proteins (MRP), from the cell wall of strain D-282, but not from the cell wall of strain T-15. Only strain D-282 (MRP-positive) induced clinical signs of disease and markedly increased neutrophil numbers in pigs. Streptococci were more frequently isolated from fecal swab specimens obtained from pigs inoculated with strain D-282 (MRP-positive) than from specimens obtained from pigs inoculated with strain T-15 (MRP-negative). Both strains were isolated from nasal swab specimens obtained from all infected pigs. Postmortem examination revealed fibrinopurulent meningitis, polyserositis, and polyarthritis in pigs inoculated with strain D-282; this strain was isolated from the CNS, serosae, visceral organs, heart, and joints. Whereas strains D-282 caused several pathologic changes, strain T-15, isolated from the lungs, caused only pneumonia. Both strains were isolated from the tonsils of all pigs. Virulence differed distinctly between the MRP-positive and the MRP-negative strains.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of sulfonamides against some porcine pathogens.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of sulfonamides were determined against Bordetella bronchiseptica (n = 10), Pasteurella multocida (n = 10), Haemophilus pleuropneumoniae (n = 20), and Streptococcus suis (n = 10) strains isolated from pigs with atrophic rhinitis, pneumonia, or meningitis. Sulfonamides tested in an agar dilution method were sulfachloropyridazine, sulfadiazine, sulfadimethoxine, sulfamethazine, sulfadoxine, sulfisoxazole, sulfamerazine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethoxypyridazine, sulfanilamide, sulfatroxazole, and sulfisomidine. Results indicated that monotherapy of S suis infections with sulfonamides should not be encouraged because the MIC50 of all sulfonamides investigated was greater than 32 micrograms/ml. The MIC50 of the sulfonamides against B bronchiseptica ranged from 0.5 to 8 micrograms/ml, against P multocida from 2 to 32 micrograms/ml, and against H pleuropneumoniae from 8 to 64 micrograms/ml. The MIC50 of sulfachloropyridazine, sulfadiazine, sulfadimethoxine, sulfamerazine, and sulfamethoxazole for the gram-negative bacteria did not exceed 16 micrograms/ml. Among these compounds, sulfamethoxazole had the highest activity. The frequently prescribed sulfamethazine had an overall low antimicrobial activity.

AB  
TI  - Studies of the protective effect of different fractions of sera from pigs immune  to Streptococcus suis type 2 infection.
AB  - Inoculation of mice with high doses of Streptococcus suis type 2 caused depression, anorexia, lethargy and sometimes death. This was prevented by prior inoculation of whole immune pig serum, the IgM and IgG fractions of immune pig serum and serum enriched with antibody to surface antigens. Clinical signs were not prevented by prior inoculation of pre-immune serum or serum depleted of antibody to surface antigens. Serum fractions that were protective in vivo were also opsonic in vitro. Western blot analysis identified two antigens of 44 and 78 kd that were recognized strongly by protective sera and a further four of 86, 94, 130 and 136 kd that were recognized less intensely.
TI  - Two cases of Streptococcus suis meningitis.
AB  
TI  - Prevalence of Streptococcus suis types 1 and 2 in domestic pigs in Australia and  New Zealand.
AB  - Using an indirect fluorescent antibody test, 54 per cent of 734 palatine tonsils  of conventional pigs slaughtered in Australia and New Zealand were found to be infected with Streptococcus suis type 1 and 73 per cent of 959 were infected with S suis type 2. Variations in the prevalence of infection in pigs from different herds were thought to be due to differences in the sample sizes rather than to real differences in the prevalence between herds. The prevalence of infection with S suis was similar in pigs of either sex and in different age groups. Streptococcus suis type 2 was detected in the blood of 3 per cent of apparently normal pigs slaughtered at a meat processing plant. The presence of this organism in edible tissue may pose a health risk to consumers and meat-workers. Both S suis types 1 and 2 were detected in the vaginas and uteri of slaughtered pigs and the female reproductive tract could be another site for the carriage of infection. Piglets from sows with vaginas infected with S suis type 2 became infected earlier than piglets from sows with uninfected vaginas. No infected male reproductive tracts were detected and venereal transmission of S suis therefore appears unlikely. Three specific pathogen free herds were found to be free from infection with both S suis types 1 and 2. It is concluded that hysterectomy derived piglets are delivered free from infection, whereas some piglets born to sows with uterine and vaginal infections are either born infected or become infected at, or soon after, birth.
TI  - Fatal Streptococcus suis septicemia in an abattoir worker.
AB  - A 51-year-old abattoir worker became ill with high fever and was admitted to hospital late in the evening, where he died 4 h later. Smears of peripheral blood taken 7 h after death showed numerous cocci. Cultures of the blood grew beta-hemolytic streptococci exhibiting the biochemical properties of Streptococcus suis II. A complete autopsy with extensive microscopical studies showed numerous bacteria in small vessels of several organs, but no bacterial colonisation of tissues, meningitis, or other relevant lesions were found. The group R antigen of the bacteria could be demonstrated by immunofluorescence in paraffin sections of the kidney and the adrenal gland. Two similar cases of fulminant fatal Streptococcus suis II septicemia have been reported from Denmark. This appears to be the first case observed in the Federal Republic of Germany.

TI  - [Type 2 Streptococcus suis (R-Streptococci) as pathogens of occupational diseases. Report of a case and a review of the literature].
AB  - Report on the second human case of a Streptococcus suis type 2 (group R streptococci) infection in the GDR. The patient, a 33-year-old butcher, fell ill with an acute meningitis and an initial myocarditis. Group R streptococci were isolated from cerebrospinal fluid and blood. The patient was treated with penicillin G, ampicillin and gentamicin, followed by trimethoprim-sulfamerazine. Both, meningitis and myocarditis disappeared and the patient recovered completely. The disease was recognized as an occupational disease. Review of the literature. Since 1968 108 cases of human S.suis type 2 infections were described, mostly as meningitis. In most of the cases a close contact to pigs could be confirmed.
TI  - Hemagglutination activities of group B, C, D, and G streptococci: demonstration of novel sugar-specific cell-binding activities in Streptococcus suis.
AB  - A total of 378 streptococcal isolates of Lancefield groups B, C, D and G were tested for their ability to hemagglutinate untreated, sialidase-treated, and endo-beta-galactosidase-treated human erythrocytes. Of the 43 strains showing positive hemagglutination, 9 were inhibitable with neutral monosaccharides. Four strains were inhibited with galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine, whereas five were inhibited with galactose only. A third, sialic acid-specific adhesion activity was suggested for two additional strains on the basis of their agglutination of native and endo-beta-galactosidase-treated but not sialidase-treated erythrocytes. All the sugar-specific agglutination activities detected were confined to Streptococcus suis strains of group D streptococci, whereas streptococci of other groups did not exhibit these types of hemagglutination activities. The adhesins were sensitive to proteases and heat treatment, which indicates that they were proteins. The hemagglutinating isolates of S. suis originated from pig brain and lung, human brain, and the tonsils of healthy pigs. No clear correlation with a particular serotype was observed. These results demonstrate the occurrence of unique sugar-specific adherence activities in S. suis, an important pig pathogen with occasional human pathogenicity.

AB  
TI  - A murine model of Streptococcus suis type 2 meningitis in the pig.
AB  - When young or adult mice were infected experimentally with isolates of Streptococcus suis type 2 of known pathogenicity for pigs, the organisms produced disease, young mice being more susceptible than adults. An isolate of S suis type 2 less pathogenic for pigs also appeared less pathogenic in mice. The organism could be reisolated from infected mice for up to 42 days. Inoculum size was one factor influencing the likelihood of an individual mouse developing meningitis following intravenous inoculation. Transmission of the organism from inoculated to in-contact mice occurred in young mice after intravenous or oral administration. These studies indicate that the behaviour of S suis type 2 in mice resembles its behaviour in pigs.
TI  - Immunisation of pigs with live cultures of Streptococcus suis type 2.
AB  - Repeated intravenous injections of pigs with live virulent cultures of Streptococcus suis type 2 stimulated a strong protective response against subsequent challenge. This protection was transferred passively to susceptible pigs by the inoculation of sera from protected pigs. A strong protective response was also stimulated by repeated inoculations of live cultures of non-pathogenic isolates. The protective response did not eliminate S suis type 2 organisms already established in the tonsils or joints, nor prevent the establishment of subclinical infection in the tonsils.
TI  - [Systemic infection caused by Streptococcus suis].
AB  - Streptococcus suis type 2 was isolated from blood and cerebrospinal fluid in a 49-year-old butcher as the causative organism of a generalized septic infection with meningeal involvement. High-dosage penicillin G treatment quickly terminated the fever and all neurological signs disappeared completely. Streptococcus suis type 2 causes a zoonosis, which usually occurs as an occupational disease among those handling pigs or pork (farmers, butchers etc.). Sequelae of such infection not rarely are damage to the VIIIth cranial nerve, especially loss of hearing.
TI  - Kill kinetics of the cephalosporin antibiotics cephalexin and cefuroxime against  bacteria of veterinary importance.
AB  - Kill kinetic studies for two cephalosporin antibiotics, cephalexin and cefuroxime were carried out against veterinary strains of Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Streptococcus suis, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae and a laboratory culture of Staphylococcus aureus. In more than 90 per cent of cases a kill of more than 99 per cent was achieved within four hours of antibiotic treatment at concentrations of 2 or 4 micrograms/ml. Although cefuroxime was effective at lower concentrations than cephalexin the rates of kill of the two antibiotics were comparable. The results are discussed in relation to in vivo dosage regimens.
TI  - Bacterial endocarditis presenting as acute monoarthritis.
AB  - The presentation of a pig farmer with acute arthritis of the shoulder, cardiac murmurs, and Streptococcus suis growing on blood cultures highlights one of the rheumatological presentations of bacterial endocarditis. The need for a thorough general medical examination together with synovial fluid and blood culture in patients with acute monarthritis is emphasised. The suggestion that acute arthritis related to endocarditis is in nature truly septic, rather than mediated by circulating immune complexes, is supported.
TI  - Isolation of Streptococcus suis from diseased pigs in Canada.
AB  - A total of 260 isolates of streptococci collected over a 9-year period from diseased pigs submitted for necropsy were studied. Seventy-seven percent of isolates were identified as S. suis and 32% of S. suis isolates were retrieved in pure culture. S. suis was found more frequently in lungs and was often isolated in conjunction with Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Pasteurella multocida, Escherichia coli and other microorganisms. A total of 151 (76%) of S. suis isolates could be serotyped within the 9 recognized serotypes. Serotype 2 was the most prevalent with 33%, followed by serotypes 3, 5 and 7. All isolates were sensitive to ampicillin, penicillin, cephradine, chloramphenicol and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Resistance to streptomycin, neomycin and tetracycline appeared to be very high.
TI  - Streptococcus suis type 1 infection of sucking pigs.
AB  
TI  - Meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis in humans.
AB  - Between 1968 and 1984, 30 strains of Streptococcus suis causing meningitis were isolated in the Netherlands. Twenty-eight strains were type 2, one was type 4, and one was untypable. The average age of the patients infected with these strains was 49 years (range, 21-76 years); the male-to-female ratio was 6.5. Twenty-five patients (83%) were employed in the pork industry. Two patients (7%) died. In seven cases (23%), predisposing factors were identified. The most frequent sequela was hearing loss (54% of surviving patients). The data for these 30 patients were compared with those for 30 patients from outside the Netherlands whose cases of meningitis due to S. suis type 2 were described between 1968 and 1985. No differences were found. The estimated annual risk of developing S. suis meningitis among Dutch abattoir workers and pig breeders was approximately 3.0/100,000--a rate 1,500 times higher than that among persons not working in the pork industry.

TI  - Streptococcus suis bacteraemia.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is a zoonotic pathogen which causes meningitis, arthritis and  septicaemia in pigs, and rarely meningitis or septicaemia in humans. This organism has recently been isolated from pigs in New Zealand, where it appears to be widely distributed in pig herds. This case is the first report of human infection in New Zealand.
TI  - Gross and histopathological findings in unusual lesions caused by Streptococcus suis in pigs. II. Central nervous system lesions.
AB  - Subacute meningoencephalitis or meningoencephalomyelitis caused by Streptococcus  suis was diagnosed in 53 pigs over a four-year period. Affected pigs averaging 11 weeks of age with a range from five days to 26 weeks, had been treated with antibiotics and had partially recovered. Hyperemia of meningeal vessels and modest increase in cerebrospinal fluid were the most common gross central nervous system lesions. Histologically, fibrin, edema and a mixture of inflammatory cells were present in meninges and choroid plexus. Linear and perivascular infiltrates of neutrophils and mononuclear inflammatory cells invaded the brain and spinal cord and similar infiltrates were in lumina of ventricles and the spinal canal. Inflammatory cells also invaded the superficial layers of the brain directly from the overlying meninges. Bilateral subacute optic perineuritis and Gasserian ganglioneuritis also occurred. Segmental cortical necrosis of cerebellar folia characterized by degeneration, necrosis, neuronophagia and drop out of groups of Purkinje cells was a distinct lesion seen in 27 of the 53 pigs. Mild spongiosis of white matter in the cerebellum and brain stem accompanied these changes.
TI  - Gross and histopathological findings in unusual lesions caused by Streptococcus suis in pigs. I. Cardiac lesions.
AB  - Unusual lesions caused by Streptococcus suis involved the heart of 48 pigs necropsied over a four-year period. Lesions included fibrinopurulent pericarditis (six pigs), hemorrhagic, necrotizing myocarditis resembling mulberry heart disease (21 pigs), and vegetative valvular endocarditis (21 pigs). Histologically, the myocarditis was characterized by focally extensive and diffuse hemorrhages and necrosis, with infiltrations of neutrophils and mononuclear cells, and thrombosis of small and large myocardial vessels. The 21 pigs with vegetative valvular endocarditis generally were over ten weeks old and had died suddenly. The left atrioventricular valve was affected in 18 hearts. Most of an affected valve was replaced by a layer of granulation tissue covered by a mixture of fibrin, inflammatory cells, necrotic debris and large numbers of coccoid bacteria.

TI  - Streptococcus suis infections in Danish pigs and experimental infection with Streptococcus suis serotype 7.
AB  - During a two-year period, Streptococcus suis serotypes 1-8 were isolated from 108 pigs examined at the laboratory. S. suis serotypes 2 and 7 represented 75% of the isolates. S. suis serotype 7 was isolated more frequently than reported from other countries, and mostly from piglets less than 3 weeks of age. Experimental inoculation of 7-day-old piglets with S. suis serotype 7 provoked severe illness within a week in 6 out of 7 animals. By bacteriological and pathological examination it was found that S. suis serotype 7 was pathogenic to piglets, giving rise to septicemia with predilection for joints, serous membranes and meninges.

TI  - [Streptococcus suis type 2 in swine. An imported problem?].
AB  - Investigations were carried out on eighteen farms in the Province of Gelderland to determine whether it was possible to use biopsy specimens of the tonsils to differentiate between farms with clinical problems caused by Streptococcus suis type 2 and farms without these problems. The proportion of carriers of this organism on the farms was 14 per cent and 2 per cent respectively, so that this differentiation is feasible. It was also studied whether this proportion differed on farms which imported pigs from Great Britain and farms which did not do so; the proportion of carriers on farms having animals imported from Great Britain was found to be higher than that on farms not using these importations, viz., 17 per cent and one per cent respectively.
TI  - Septic arthritis caused by Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - A case of septic arthritis and septicaemia due to Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is reported. To our knowledge, this is the first case in which the causative organism has been isolated from the joint-fluid. Involvement of joints is a feature of S. suis infection in pigs, and may be more common in human beings than previously realised. Infectious arthritis caused by beta-haemolytic streptococci may be due to S. suis and result from contact with pigs or raw pork.
TI  - Streptococcus suis type 2 infections in pigs in the Netherlands (Part two).
AB  - Since 1983 some pig breeding and fattening farms in the Netherlands have been faced with a considerable mortality in pigs due to Streptococcus suis type 2 infections. The most predominant clinical feature of S. suis type 2 infection is meningitis, although sudden deaths often occur. It was noted that some affected farms had imported breeding stock from the United Kingdom. Tonsils of slaughter pigs were collected from herds with and without a history of S. suis type 2 infections. Bacteriological examination was done by using an elective-selective medium. No significant difference was found in carrier rates of S. suis type 2 between clinically healthy and affected herds (38% vs. 45%). A cohort study was carried out by regular bacteriological examination of tonsil biopsies on a farm with a high incidence of streptococcal meningitis. Twenty-seven percent of the pigs were carriers of S. suis type 2 at nine weeks of age. Possible methods for disease control are discussed.

TI  - In vitro antibacterial properties of EL-870, a new semi-synthetic macrolide antibiotic.
AB  - A new macrolide antibiotic, EL-870, 20-deoxo-20-(3,5-dimethylpiperidin-1-yl)desmycosin, has been prepared by chemical modification of desmycosin. In vitro, against selected animal bacterial pathogens, it inhibited growth of Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella haemolytica, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Streptococcus suis, Actinomyces pyogenes and certain other bacteria at levels of 6.25 micrograms/ml or less. In general, the MICs for Gram-negative enteric bacteria have been greater than 50 micrograms/ml. Concentrations equivalent to 4 X the MIC value were bactericidal for Pasteurella sp. EL-870 had other antibacterial properties which were characteristic of macrolide antibiotics.
TI  - The detection of pigs carrying Streptococcus suis type 2.
AB  - An indirect fluorescent antibody test (I.F.A.T.) was performed on tonsillar swabs collected at slaughter and on nasal swabs from electrically stunned pigs prior to exsanguination. The identification of carriers of Streptococcus suis type 2 using the I.F.A.T. was compared with bacteriological isolation. If it is assumed that 100% of pigs were carrying the bacterium, 76% of 89 carriers were detected when the I.F.A.T. was performed on the bacterial growth from blood agar cultures of tonsillar swabs, compared with only 15% detected using cultural techniques. Similarly, I.F.A.T. on nasal swabs increased the sensitivity of the detection of carriers. Nasal swabbing, although of lower sensitivity than tonsillar swabbing, allows for the detection of S. suis type 2 carriers in the live animal.
TI  - Isolation of Streptococcus suis using a selective medium.
AB  - A selective medium containing tryptic soy agar, 5% defibrinated bovine blood, crystal violet, nalidixic acid and gentamicin significantly improved the isolation rate of Streptococcus suis from tonsilar tissue of slaughtered pigs. Ninety-five percent of the S. suis isolates identified in Guelph were confirmed as S. suis in Copenhagen, but only six out of 21 isolates typed as capsular serotype 2 in Guelph were confirmed to possess serotype 2 antigen in Copenhagen. Sixty-four percent of the S. suis isolates were not typable within the current scheme of capsular serotypes from 1 to 13 and type 1/2.
TI  - Meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis type II.
AB  - A 49 year old head porter developed meningitis shown to be caused by Streptococcus suis type II. The rare human infections with the organism, a pathogen of pigs, usually occur in those employed handling pig meat and are associated with auditory or vestibular dysfunction.
TI  - Streptococcus suis in slaughter pigs and abattoir workers.
AB  - The detection and identification of Streptococcus suis type 2 in 8.1% of 347 pig  herds of southwestern Ontario revealed that the infection is widespread in this area. A herd suspected to be infected showed a carrier rate of 9.7% among the 62 animals sampled. These subclinical carriers represent a potential source of infection for slaughterhouse workers. From studies of contamination of hands and knives, it was concluded that eviscerators involved in removing the larynx and lungs from the carcasses have a significantly higher (p less than or equal to 0.05) risk of exposure to Streptococcus suis than other abattoir workers.
TI  - Meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis: case report and review of the literature.
AB  - A case of purulent meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis type 2 (group R streptococcus) is described. It occurred in a 69-year-old farmer's wife who raised pigs on her farm. Here, as well as in nearly all other cases of S. suis meningitis reported to date, close occupational contact with pigs or pork preceded the infection; this epidemiological link can be explained by the frequent occurrence of S. suis as a commensal and opportunistic pathogen in pigs. Up until now, S. suis infection in man has been rare and has had a good prognosis. However, disturbances of the eighth cranial nerve have been found in many patients, even causing permanent deafness in some. These and other clinical, epidemiological and microbiological features of S. suis disease in man are discussed here.
TI  - Identification and characterization of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - A total of 188 Streptococcus suis strains isolated from pigs with various lesions, mainly bronchopneumonia, were identified using classical biochemical methods and using the API 20 STREP system. The serological classification was performed by precipitation reactions after Lancefield extraction, slide-coagglutinations and capsular reaction tests. Fifty-nine strains belonged to Types 1, 1/2 or 2, 78 strains to Types 3-8 and 51 strains were non-typable. The results of the different tests and the biochemical differences between the different serotypes are discussed.

TI  - Streptococcus suis infections in pigs in the Netherlands (Part I).
AB  - Data are presented on the incidence of various streptococcal infections in pigs in the Netherlands. 314 Strains isolated in the course of routine post-mortem diagnosis were examined. The most frequently occurring streptococcus was S. subacidus (bio) type II which was isolated in 31.2% of the cases. S. suis type 2 (Serogroup R) and S. equisimilis (Serogroup C) constituted 16.2% and 13.7% of the isolates respectively. Besides meningitis, endocarditis and polyserositis S. suis type 2 infections may frequently be associated with pneumonia (42%). The biochemical profiles of the various S. suis and S. subacidus (bio) types are presented. The profile of both species is almost identical. It seems justified to use the name S. suis for strains with this characteristic profile and to abandon the name S. subacidus. Haemolysis does not appear to be a suitable characteristic to screen for S. subacidus/S. suis types. In comparing three serological methods for typing S. suis type 2, gel precipitation using Fuller's extract and slide agglutination give an almost 100% correlation. These two methods are recommended for serotyping.

TI  - Cefadroxil in the horse: pharmacokinetics and in vitro antibacterial activity.
AB  - Sodium cefadroxil was administered as a single intravenous dose (25 mg/kg) to six healthy adult mares. Plasma samples were collected over a 24-h period and cefadroxil concentrations were measured by microbiological assay. The pharmacokinetic behavior of the drug was appropriately described in terms of a one-compartment open model. Values for the major pharmacokinetic terms were: extrapolated initial plasma concentration = 59.2 +/- 15.0 micrograms/ml; half-life = 46 +/- 20 min; apparent volume of distribution = 462 +/- 191 ml/kg; and body clearance = 7.0 +/- 0.6 ml/min.kg. In a subsequent study, a suspension of cefadroxil monohydrate was administered intragastrically (25 mg/kg) to the same six horses. Plasma concentrations of the drug peaked at 1-2 h but, in general, absorption was both poor and inconsistent. The data were unsuitable for determination of cefadroxil bioavailability from this oral dosage form. Ninety-nine isolates of eleven bacterial species obtained from clinically ill horses were tested for susceptibility to cefadroxil. All strains of Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, coagulase-positive staphylococci, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and five out of six strains of Actinobacillus suis were highly susceptible to the drug (MIC less than 4 micrograms/ml). Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella sp. showed intermediate susceptibility (MIC 4-16 micrograms/ml), while all isolates of Corynebacterium (Rhodococcus) equi, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa proved to be highly resistant to cefadroxil (MIC greater than 128 micrograms/ml).
TI  - Cross-reactions between alpha-streptococci and Omniserum, a polyvalent pneumococcal serum, demonstrated by direct immunofluorescence, immunoelectroosmophoresis, and latex agglutination.
AB  - In recent years several groups have used serological methods to demonstrate pneumococcal capsular antigens in sputum. In the present study 123 strains of alpha-hemolytic streptococci (including 97 strains from sputum or pharyngeal specimens) were tested for cross-reactions with a polyvalent antipneumococcal serum (Omniserum). Representatives of the following species were included: Streptococcus bovis, S. equinus, S. intermedius, S. lactis, S. milleri, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. suis, and Aerococcus viridans. Serological reactions were detected by direct immunofluorescence, immunoelectroosmophoresis, and latex agglutination. Fifteen (12%) of the strains gave positive reactions by all three methods. Positive reactions were also observed with another 32 strains (26%) with two of the methods, whereas 37 strains (30%) gave positive reactions by just one technique. Altogether 84 (68%) strains gave positive reactions with one or more of the methods. Latex agglutination gave positive reactions with 26 (21%) strains compared with 57 (46%) in immunofluorescence and 63 (51%) in immunoelectroosmophoresis. Absorption of the antiserum with one alpha-hemolytic strain reduced but did not entirely eliminate the cross-reactions with five tested strains. These findings indicate a potential risk of cross-reactions with polyvalent antipneumococcal serum in tests carried out on sputa or other specimens which may be contaminated with alpha-hemolytic streptococci.

TI  - [Respiratory diseases of swine: some epidemiologic aspects].
AB  - Epidemiological surveys enable to know better the aetiology of respiratory diseases. The surveys carried out in slaughter-houses in Brittany (France) in 1980 and 1981, show a worrying situation concerning porcine respiratory diseases. Microbiological studies brought out the preponderance of the isolation of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Pasteurella multocida, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Streptococcus suis and Actinobacillus suis. Some patterns of experimental infection with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and Bordetella bronchiseptica are exposed.
TI  - Monitoring herds for Streptococcus suis type 2 by sampling tonsils of slaughter pigs.
AB  - Heads were removed soon after slaughter from the dressed carcases of 155 pigs belonging to 12 herds with a history of streptococcal meningitis and from 180 pigs from four herds believed to be free from this disease. Deep scrapings from both tonsils were sown on two selective media. Streptococcus suis type 2 was detected in a proportion of pigs from the 12 herds with a history of the disease, including three herds in which no cases were noted during the year this study was made. Pigs in six of these herds had received therapeutic levels of certain antibiotics in their feed as growers. The confirmed detectable tonsillar carrier rates varied between these 12 herds from 20 to 90 per cent and between batches of heads from one herd from 0 to 100 per cent. Carrier rates could not be correlated with disease levels, herd size or husbandry system. S suis type 2 was also detected in pigs from two herds thought to be free of the disease, at rates of 20 and 1.5 per cent.
TI  - Carrier rate of Streptococcus suis capsular type 2 in palatine tonsils of slaughtered pigs.
AB  - Palatine tonsils of 143 slaughtered pigs aged 4 to 6 months were investigated for the presence of Streptococcus suis type 2. Slices (50 micron) of frozen tonsils were cultured on a selective agar medium containing antibodies against S. suis type 2 in which colonies of this bacterium showed a halo of immunoprecipitation. When tonsils were sectioned in one plane S. suis type 2 was found in 45 of 143 pigs (32%). This percentage increased to 50% when tonsils were sectioned in more then one plane, which was done on 55 tonsils. The first 45 strains showing a ring of immunoprecipitation were studied and found to be biochemically identical to our reference strain 735 (de Moor) and to 23 isolates from human patients with meningitis. In slices incubated for 24 h at 37 degrees C on selective agar plates and stained with hematoxylin and eosin after fixation, it could be demonstrated that S. suis type 2 was confined to the crypt lumen. The same was true in sections fixed directly (without incubation) that were stained by an indirect immunoperoxidase method with a rabbit anti-S. suis type 2 serum.
TI  - Capsular polysaccharides of nongroupable streptococci that cross-react with pneumococcal group 19.
AB  - The cross-reactivity and chemical characterization of the nongroupable streptococcal and pneumococcal group 19 polysaccharides (PS) have been studied. Extensive cross-reactions were observed between capsular PSs of streptococcal strains 14636/74, 4907, 4731 and pneumococcal type 19F and 19A antisera. Streptococcal 14636/74 PS had an identical composition to that of pneumococcal 19F PS. Type 19F and 14636/74 PS were composed of equimolar amounts of rhamnose, glucose, N-acetyl mannosamine, and phosphorus. The capsular PS of strains 4731 and 4907 contained rhamnose, glucose, ribose, N-acetyl mannosamine, and N-acetyl glucosamine in different molar ratios. Extensive immunologic reactivity was observed between the 19F and 14636/74 PS, as determined by light scattering rate nephelometry, passive immune hemolysis, and precipitin reaction. There was an identity reaction by immunodiffusion between type 19F and 14636/74 PS when reacted with rabbit antiserum against either organism. Biochemical studies showed that strain 14636/74 was not a pneumococcus, because it was optochin resistant, was bile insoluble, did not possess the C-carbohydrate antigen common to all pneumococci, and produced neither pneumolysin nor IgA protease. Furthermore, it grew in comparatively simple media in contrast to the complex nutritional requirements of pneumococci. The 13C-NMR spectra of the 19F and 14636/74 PS were identical. These two capsular PS can, therefore, be considered identical.
TI  - Isolation of Streptococcus suis from swine in Nebraska.
AB  - Streptococcus suis was isolated from swine with localized and diffuse infections. The isolates (n = 121) were unable to grow in broth containing 6.5% NaCl. Their abilities to hydrolyze esculin were variable, as were their fermentative reactions in lactose, trehalose, raffinose, and inulin. Sorbitol was not attacked by any strain. Serologic reactions were obtained between the isolates and coagglutination reagents prepared from commercially available antisera to streptococcal groups D, R, or S.
TI  - The bacteriology of endocarditis in slaughter pigs.
AB  - Streptococcus suis was isolated from 11 (10 per cent) out of 107 cases of endocarditis in slaughter pigs from which bacteria of any kind were isolated. Seven of the isolates belonged to the capsular serotypes 1, 2 and 1/2. Four were non-typable owing to lack of capsule. The organism isolated most often was Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, which was found in 68 (64 per cent) cases.
TI  - Studies of Streptococcus suis type 2 infection in pigs.
AB  - Investigations into the immunology, pathogenesis and epidemiology of Streptococcus suis type 2 infections were carried out in experimental pigs and in naturally-occurring field outbreaks of disease. The capsular polysaccharide from Str. suis type 2 was shown to induce opsonic antibodies in pigs when injected with Freund's incomplete adjuvant, but difficulties encountered in experimental production of the disease prevented a study of their protective effects. Problems with the bactericidal tests led to an investigation of other assays for antibodies against Str. suis type 2, namely, a phagocytic test with pig neutrophils, a mixed reverse passive antiglobulin haemagglutination test and an indirect haemagglutination test. There was evidence that with modifications both the latter tests would be useful. Transmission studies in 39 conventionally-reared and 7 hysterectomy-derived, colostrum-deprived pigs yielded interesting results with regard to the distribution of the organism in relation to the disease process. Tonsil carriage in clinically-healthy pigs was demonstrated after experimental and natural infection. Detectable carrier rates varied between 0 and 59%. The organism was shown to persist in the presence of circulating opsonic antibodies and in pigs on penicillin-medicated feed. Attempts to isolate the organism from the genital tract were unsuccessful. Medicated early weaning and classical SPF techniques applied to infected herds appeared to be effective in producing pigs free from Str. suis type 2 infection.

TI  - Factors affecting the survival of Streptococcus suis type 2.
AB  - The survival of Streptococcus suis type 2 was assessed in experimentally inoculated faeces and dust stored at 0, 9 and 22 to 25 degrees C. The organism survived in faeces for 104 days at 0 degrees C, up to 10 days at 9 degrees C and up to eight days at 22 to 25 degrees C. It survived in dust for up to 54 days at 0 degrees C and up to 25 days at 9 degrees C but could not be isolated from dust stored at room temperature for 24 hours. The organism survived at 4 degrees C in nutrient medium for up to nine months but in distilled water for only one to two weeks. At 50 degrees C it survived in water or broth for up to two hours but at 60 degrees C it only survived for 10 minutes. The organism was rapidly inactivated by disinfectants and cleansers, commonly used on farms and in laboratories, at concentrations less than those recommended for use by the manufacturers.
TI  - Further studies on the subclinical carrier state of Streptococcus suis type 2 in  pigs.
AB  - Tonsil swabs were taken from 626 pigs of all ages in four infected herds. Streptococcus suis type 2 was isolated from 106 pigs aged between three weeks and 18 months. Detectable carrier rates in different groups of pigs varied between 0 and 80 per cent and were highest in weaned pigs aged between four and 10 weeks. Deep scrape cultures carried out post mortem suggested that the actual carrier rate was higher than that detected by tonsil swabs before death. Detection was improved by using two selective media. S suis type 2 persisted in the tonsils in the presence of circulating opsonic and binding antibodies and in pigs receiving penicillin-medicated feed. It was detected in the tonsils of individuals for up to 521 days. It was rarely detected in the nose. Some carriers appeared to eliminate the infection. Weaned detectable tonsil carriers transmitted the infection to previously uninfected pigs with which they were mixed. Titres of serum binding antibodies assessed by a micro enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were relatively low and results from infected and non-infected pigs were not always distinguishable.

Biochemically all strains were similar, and 31 strains were serologically identical to the previously described groups R, S, and RS streptococci, provisionally designated Streptococcus suis types 1, 2, and 1/2 by Elliot. The remaining 107 strains could be divided into six new capsular serotypes of S. suis.
TI  - Streptococcus suis meningitis. An important underdiagnosed disease in Hong Kong.
AB  - Streptococcus suis has been identified as the most common cause of meningitis in  adults in Hong Kong. The disease is characterized by occupational exposure to pigs or pork. It occurs in summer, and is associated with early, severe, sensory deafness, arthritis, uveitis, and loss of balance. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid may show an elevated white cell count with a predominance of either polymorphs or lymphocytes. Misinterpretation of the microbiological findings by inexperienced staff members may lead to a failure to correctly diagnose this disease. This is the first report of a series of cases of Strept. suis meningitis outside western Europe. Health authorities are urged to be aware of this disease in pork-consuming countries.

TI  - Streptococcus R (Streptococcus suis type II) infection in pigs in Japan.
AB  - Since the first outbreak of an epizootic disease on a pig farm in Shimane Prefecture in 1979, similar diseases have occurred continually on other 8 pig farms in the same prefecture until 1982. Main clinical symptoms of the disease were recumbency, convulsion, anorexia and paddling. The diseased pigs ranged mostly from 35 to 67 days of age. Monthly fatality on one pig farm for 1 year was 0.2 to 3.6%. Morbidities in affected litters were mostly at a level of 20 to 30% on 7 pig farms. The diseases were diagnosed as streptococcal meningitis and septicemia with each one of endocarditis and pneumonitis by pathological and bacteriological studies on 20 affected pigs. Distribution of piglets from a breeding farm to pig farms was considered as one of the causes of prevalence in the prefecture. Representative 20 strains of the isolates from diseased animals on 9 pig farms were identified as Streptococcus R (Streptococcus suis type II) by biological and serological examinations. For the latter examination, anti-Streptococcus R, S and T sera were prepared. It was also indicated that the disease had occurred in 8 prefectures in addition to Shimane, because positive results had been obtained from 41 strains submitted from those prefectures for serological diagnosis. The minimal inhibitory concentration was examined in 18 drugs to 19 isolates. It was the lowest in ampicillin and thiopeptin of all the drugs.
TI  - [Preparation of immunosorbents from lipopolysaccharides and polysaccharides extracted from various gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The method of binding of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) extracted from Salmonella typhimurium to aminohexyl-sepharose 4B by activation with benzoquinone was applied to three different LPS extracted from several enterobacteria species: S. seftenberg 1,3,19, S. cholerae suis 6(2),7 and Escherichia coli O141:H32. It was also used for two polysaccharides (PS) extracted from S. seftenberg 1,3,19 and Streptococcus agalactiae type II strain, respectively. Both PS were free from amino groups but exhibited the corresponding antigenic determinants of the cell wall. The use of these immunosorbents enabled us to obtain a monospecific antiserum. They may be a useful tool for serological identification of salmonella and group B streptococci. This method may be applied for other bacterial surface PS. The possible regeneration of such immunosorbents without appreciable loss of their antigen binding capacity makes possible their use for obtaining monospecific antibodies on a preparative scale.
TI  - Streptococcus suis type II-associated diseases in swine: observations of a one-year study.
AB  - Streptococcus suis type II was isolated from 170 pigs submitted to a veterinary diagnostic laboratory in Ontario, Canada, over a 1-year period. The most common disease condition with which the organism was identified was suppurative bronchopneumonia, usually secondary to enzootic pneumonia of pigs. The organism was also isolated in cases of pleuropneumonia, valvular endocarditis, arthritis, and vaginitis as well as from aborted fetuses. A condition characterized by neonatal disease and rapid death, usually within the first 24 hours of life, was identified in 23 pigs from 5 farms. Meningitis was identified in 15 weaned pigs from 8 farms. All S suis type II isolates tested for antimicrobial sensitivity were sensitive to penicillin and ampicillin. Most isolates were also sensitive to chloramphenicol and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, but resistant to streptomycin and tetracycline. Accessions from which the organism was isolated were concentrated in the colder months of the year, with few or no isolates recorded in the summer months.
TI  - Streptococcus suis Type 2 Infection in Swine in Ontario: A Review of Clinical and Pathological Presentations.
AB  - Over an 18 month period Streptococcus suis type 2 was isolated in pure or mixed culture in 19 disease outbreaks in pigs. Morbidity and case fatality were variable. Clinical signs were of a nervous or respiratory disease or of death with no premonitory signs. Gross and microscopic findings included one or more of fibrinous polyserositis, fibrinous or hemmorhagic bronchopneumonia, purulent meningitis, myocardial necrosis, focal myocarditis and valvular endocarditis. Brain, cerebrospinal fluid and lung were most reliable sites for isolation of the organism.

AB  - A disease was noted among the replacement sows on a pig-breeding complex, exhibiting signs of pyelonephritis, cystitis, and metritis. Bacteriologic studies revealed the presence of streptococci. Streptococcus typing was carried out by means of biochemical, immunodiffusion, and immunoelectrophoretic investigations. The isolated strains were shown to belong to group D--Str. suis. The treatment of HCL-extracts to D-group streptococci with pepsin considerably raised the value of the respective immunoelectrophoretic method in the process of typing.
TI  - Streptococcal infection in young pigs. V. An immunogenic polysaccharide from Streptococcus suis type 2 with particular reference to vaccination against streptococcal meningitis in pigs.
AB  - Of 17 pigs vaccinated with STreptococcus suis type-2 capsular polysaccharide plus Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant, all developed opsonizing antibody against Str. suis type 2. Of 14 pigs vaccinated with type-2 polysaccharide alone, 4 (possibly 6) developed opsonizing antibody. It is possible that some pigs vaccinated with polysaccharide plus Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant developed opsonizing antibody in response to a 'booster' injection of polysaccharide alone. Of 21 unvaccinated control pigs, late bleeding from 3 showed opsonizing activity against Str. suis type 2.

AB  - We report a case of meningitis and perceptive deafness caused by Streptococcus suis type II (Group R beta-haemolytic streptococcus). The illness is known to be an occupational hazard of pigmeat handlers and our patient worked in a pet food factory processing pig meat. His hearing loss was very severe and showed no improvement despite adequate antibiotic treatment. The organism that was isolated is the first to show penicillin resistance. The implications of this for antibiotic treatment are discussed.
TI  - The distribution of isoprenoid quinones in streptococci of serological groups D and N.
AB  - The isoprenoid quinone contents of streptococci of serological groups D and N were investigated. Streptococcus faecalis, S. faecalis subsp. liquefaciens and S. faecalis subsp. zymogenes strains contained demethylmenaquinones with nine isoprene units as their major isoprenologues. Menaquinones with eight isoprene units predominated in S. faecium subsp. casseliflavus and S. faecium subsp. mobilis whereas menaquinones with nine isoprene units constituted the major components in strains of S. cremoris, S. cremoris subsp. alactosus, S. lactis and S. lactis subsp. diacetylactis. Strains of S. avium, S. bovis, S. durans, S. equinus, S. faecium, S. raffinolactis and S. suis contained neither menaquinones nor ubiquinones. The isoprenoid quinone data correlate well with other kinds of data on these organisms and are of value in the classification of these bacteria.
TI  - The type-specific polysaccharides of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis types 1 and 2 were subjected to digestion with lysozyme. Serologically type-specific capsular polysaccharides were isolated from the lysates by ethanol precipitation followed by Sepharose 6B chromatography. The purified type 1 polysaccharide has a Kd value of 0.074 on a Sepharose 4B column and contains galactose, glucose, N-acetyl glucosamine, N-acetyl galactosamine, and sialic acid in a molar ratio of 2.42:1.00:1.00:1.13:1.39. The type 2 polysaccharide has a Kd value of 0.185 and is composed of rhamnose, galactose, glucose, N-acetyl glucosamine, and sialic acid in a molar ratio of 1.07:3.17:1.00:0.94:1.00. A comparison is drawn between the type polysaccharides of S. suis and those of group B streptococci.
TI  - Streptococcus suis type II (group R) as a cause of endophthalmitis.
AB  - A case is reported of a patient with bilateral endophthalmitis, meningitis, sensorineural deafness, labyrinthitis, and septicaemia due to Streptococcus suis type II (group R). The organism is known to produce epidemic meningitis, septicaemia, and purulent arthritis in piglets, but human infection is rare, and no other case reports of ocular infection are known. The organism was sensitive to penicillin at a minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.03 mg/1.
TI  - Epizootic of concurrent cutaneous streptococcal abscesses and swinepox in a herd  of swine.
AB  - Concurrent cutaneous abscesses and swinepox were observed in a herd of swine. An  ungroupable hemolytic streptococcus was isolated from the abscesses. Tests indicated that streptococci isolated from different swine were similar if not identical. Swinepox lesions were observed on swine only after weaning. Lice (Haematopinus suis) were numerous on the suckling and weaned swine and appeared to be resistant to lindane. Abscesses, swinepox, and lice were eliminated after the swine were treated with an organic phosphate insecticide and antibacterial agents were added to the rations.

TI  - Teichoic acids of group D streptococci with special reference to strains from pig meningitis (Streptococcus suis).
AB  - Immunoelectrophoresis revealed in phenol extracts from S. faecalis and S. faecium a mixture of free and lipid-bound teichoic acids, both reactive with Group D antisera. In phenol extracts from S. suis only lipid-bound teichoic acid, also reactive with Group D antiserum, was seen. This difference probably accounts for the low yield of Group D antigen from S. suis as compared with S. faecalis and S. faecium when heating at pH 2 is used for extraction. When phenol is used good yields are obtained from S. suis as well as from S. faecalis and S. faecium. Lipoteichoic acids from S. faecalis and S. faecium have a backbone structure the same as or similar to that of Group A streptococcal teichoic acid. Lipoteichoic acid from S. suis has a structure differing from that of S. faecalis and S. faecium, e.g., possibly in the attachment of its glucosyl substituents. Precipitation reactions between S. suis lipoteichoic acid and Group D antisera were specifically inhibited by glucose. Reactions between S. bovis phenol extracts and some Group D antisera were also specifically inhibited by glucose, but extracts from S. faecalis and S. faecium were not. This may indicate a monosaccharide glucosyl substituent in teichoic acid from S. suis and S. bovis instead of the di- or trisaccharide previously postulated as the glucosyl substituent in the teichoic acid of S. faecalis.
TI  - Streptococcal infection in young pigs. IV. An outbreak of streptococcal meningitis in weaned pigs.
AB  - Twenty-eight pigs died in an outbreak of streptococcal meningitis in an East Anglian herd. Most were 10-14 weeks old. The outbreak lasted from January to April and was finally controlled by antibiotic therapy. A similar number of losses had occurred in the previous year though no diagnosis had then been made. The causal agent appeared to be a haemolytic streptococcus belonging to group D and provisionally designated Streptococcus suis type 2. It is probably identical with de Moor's group R streptococcus which causes a similar disease in the Netherlands. It is serologically distinct from Streptococcus suis type 1 which causes meningitis in piglets. Type 2 infection in pigs appears to be widespread in England and Wales and to occur in animals up to the age of at least 14 weeks. A comparison is drawn between Str. suis meningitis in pigs and group B streptococcal meningitis in human infants.
TI  - Synergism between Trichuris suis and the microbial flora of the large intestine causing dysentery in pigs.
AB  - The role of the microbial flora of the large intestine in experimental Trichuris  suis infection was studied by comparing the clinical syndrome in conventionally reared (CR) pigs, specific pathogen-free pigs, and gnotobiotic pigs. Thedisease in CR pigs was characterized by a severe mucohemorrhagic enteritis; in contrast, a mild catarrhal enteritis was observed in specific pathogen-free and gnotobiotic pigs. Spirochaetes and vibrio-like organisms were observed only in CR pigs and increased during the clinical phase of the disease. The clinical syndrome was not transmitted by oral administration of intestinal or fecal material from infected CR pigs to CR pigs free of T. suis. Smaller numbers of T. suis produced diarrhea in CR pigs and significantly reduced the growth rates of infected animals; clinical signs and the reduction in growth rate was prevented by incorporating an antibacterial substance (dimetridazole) in the food. Although clinical trichuriasis closely resembles swin dysentery, the two syndromes seem to be distinct. The present results suggest that a microbial component acts synergistically with T. suis to produce the severe clinical syndrome in CR pigs, but identification of the microbial component and the mechanism by which clinical signs are produced await further studies of the bacterial flora of the large intestine of pigs.
