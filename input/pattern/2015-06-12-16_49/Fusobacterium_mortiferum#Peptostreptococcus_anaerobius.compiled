TI  - Activities of garenoxacin (BMS-284756) and other agents against anaerobic clinical isolates.
AB  - A total of 590 clinical isolates consisting of 33 species of both gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes were collected from nine centers in the Chicago area in 1998-1999. The largest number of isolates (330 isolates, 56%) belonged to the Bacteroides group. Isolates were tested by agar dilution against garenoxacin (BMS-284756, T-3811 ME), trovafloxacin, moxifloxacin, clindamycin, imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, and cefoxitin. All but one species (2% of Bacteroides vulgatus isolates) were fully susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam and imipenem. A number of species were resistant to clindamycin. Among the fluoroquinolones, garenoxacin and trovafloxacin had an MIC at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited of <4 micro g/ml for all but two species (Fusobacterium mortiferum/varium and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius).
TI  - In vitro activities of faropenem against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of faropenem, a new oral penem, was tested against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria by using the NCCLS-approved reference method. Drugs tested included amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, clindamycin, faropenem, imipenem, and metronidazole. Of the 176 strains of Bacteroides fragilis group isolates tested, two isolates had faropenem MICs of 64 micro g/ml and imipenem MICs of >32 micro g/ml. Faropenem had an MIC of 16 micro g/ml for an additional isolate of B. fragilis; this strain was sensitive to imipenem (MIC of 1 micro g/ml). Both faropenem and imipenem had MICs of < or=4 micro g/ml for all isolates of Bacteroides capillosus (10 isolates), Bacteroides splanchnicus (13 isolates), Bacteroides ureolyticus (11 isolates), Bilophila wadsworthia (11 isolates), Porphyromonas species (42 isolates), Prevotella species (78 isolates), Campylobacter species (25 isolates), Sutterella wadsworthensis (11 isolates), Fusobacterium nucleatum (19 isolates), Fusobacterium mortiferum/varium (20 isolates), and other Fusobacterium species (9 isolates). Faropenem and imipenem had MICs of 16 to 32 micro g/ml for two strains of Clostridium difficile; the MICs for all other strains of Clostridium tested (69 isolates) were < or =4 micro g/ml. Faropenem had MICs of 8 and 16 micro g/ml, respectively, for two strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (MICs of imipenem were 2 micro g/ml). MICs were < or =4 micro g/ml for all other strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci (53 isolates) and non-spore-forming gram-positive rods (28 isolates). Other results were as expected and reported in previous studies. No metronidazole resistance was seen in gram-negative anaerobes other than S. wadsworthensis (18% resistant); 63% of gram-positive non-spore-forming rods were resistant. Some degree of clindamycin resistance was seen in most of the groups tested.
TI  - The use of an anaerobic incubator for the isolation of anaerobes from clinical samples.
AB  - An anaerobic incubator was compared with a standard jar system for the isolation  of anaerobes from clinical material. Seventy specimens were selected as likely to yield anaerobes: 342 different anaerobes were isolated in the incubator and 347 in anaebrobic jars. These included Bacteroides spp (43%), Peptococcus spp (26%), Peptostreptococcus spp (13%), Veillonella spp (7%), Fusobacterium spp (7%), Clostridium spp (2%) and miscellaneous Gram-positive nonsporing bacilli (2%). Differences in isolation rates for each system were inconsistent and minor. Sixteen anaerobes were chosen for quantitative tests at the beginning and end of the study period. Miles and Misra counts showed a slight advantage of the incubator for F nucleatum, but no difference for B fragilis, B thetaiomicron, B uniformis, B bivius, B corrodens, F mortiferum, Ps anaerobius, P prevotii or Propionibacterium acnes. In almost all cases, colonies in anaerobic jars were slightly larger than those in the incubator. Disc antibiotic sensitivity tests gave the same results in each system, at the beginning and end of the study period. The anaerobic incubator provides an effective means of isolation of anaerobes in a clinical laboratory. However, several design features of the prototype would require change if the system were introduced.
TI  - Biotransformation of 1-nitropyrene in intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Mutagenic nitroaromatic compounds have recently been found in photocopies, urban  atmosphere, automobile exhaust and wastewater. 1-Nitropyrene (1-NP) is readily formed when pyrene, ubiquitous in the environment, is exposed to nitrogen dioxide in the urban atmosphere or in automobile exhaust, and is highly mutagenic, inducing 449 his+ revertants/plate/nmol from Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 in the absence of S9 fraction in the Salmonella-microsome test. It is possible to swallow sputum or some food containing 1-NP and it would come into contact with the normal bacterial flora. We determined the 1-NP nitroreductase activity in environmental and laboratory bacterial strains. We found that the mutagenicity of 1-NP mixed with the feces of a healthy man or a culture of anaerobic bacteria was decreased. The product proved to be 1-aminopyrene (1-AP), based on its fluorescence spectrum, its mass spectrum, and its characteristic thin layer chromatographic and high performance liquid chromatographic patterns. The 1-NP nitroreductase activity of aerobic bacteria was low, but crude extracts from the anaerobic bacteria, i.e., Bacteroides fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus, Fusobacterium mortiferum, F. nucleatum, Clostridium perfringens, C. sporogenes, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, B. bifidum, Eubacterium lentum, E. limosum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, all easily converted 1-NP to 1-AP and proportionally decreased the mutagenic activity of 1-NP.
TI  - [Antibacterial and bactericidal activity of tinidazole against anaerobic bacteria comparing with metronidazole (author's transl)].
AB  - Antibacterial activity of tinidazole (1-2-(ethylsulfonyl)-2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole) against anaerobic bacteria including Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Eubacterium, Propionibacterium, Bacteroides and Fusobacterium was studied by agar dilution method comparing with metronidazole. In addition to this work, bactericidal effect of tinidazole and metronidazole against P. prevotii, B. fragilis ss. fragilis and F. varium was examined by quantitative culture method after incubation in GAM broth containing of 4 MIC, 2 MIC, 1 MIC and 1/2 MIC of both drugs against each of three strains for 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours. All the strains of Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus including P. anaerobius, P. saccharolyticus, P. prevotii and Ps. anaerobius and others were susceptible to a concentration of 6.25 mcg/ml of this drug. A concentration of 3.13 mcg/ml inhibited all strains of Bacteroides including B. fragilis ss. fragilis (12 strains), ss. vulgatus (5 strains), ss. thetaiotaomicron (4 strains) and ss. distasonis (2 strains). To this concentration all strains of Fusobacterium including F. varium (20 strains), F. mortiferum (2 strains) and other Fusobacterium sp. (5 strains) were susceptible. On the contrary, Propionibacterium acnes (6 strains) was resistant to 100 mcg/ml or more of tinidazole and metronidazole. The antibacterial activity of tinidazole was stronger against Bacteroides than that of metronidazole, while almost equal against Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Eubacterium and Fusobacterium. Tinidazole was bactericidal against F. varium in a concentration of 2 MIC till 24 hours of incubation but did not show such an activity on B. fragilis ss. fragilis in same concentration even after 12 hours of incubation. On the other hand, metronidazole was bactericidal against B. fragilis ss. fragilis while was not against F. varium. Against P. prevotii bactericidal activity of both drugs was similar. Tinidazole as well as metronidazole is an excellent chemotherapeutic agent against anaerobic bacteria excluding Propionibacterium acnes and Bifidobacterium adolescentis.
TI  - Survival of anaerobic bacteria during transportation. 1. Experimental investigations on the effect of evacuation of atmospheric air by flushing with carbon dioxide and nitrogen.
AB  - The effect of evacuation of atmospheric air during transportation on recovery of  anaerobic bacteria was investigated. Evacuation of atmospheric air from glass tubes by flushing with pure carbon dioxide lowered the content of oxygen to about 0.4 per cent. Three B. fragilis strains and one strain of Fusobacterium mortiferum and of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius were investigated. Bacterial recovery was determined one hour and 24 hours after evacuation of atmospheric air by pure carbon dioxide and pure nitrogen, was compared to bacterial recovery from samples transported with free access to atmospheric air. Evacuation by pure carbon dioxide significantly improved the recovery of one B. fragilis strain after 24 hours of transportation and significantly impaired the recovery of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius after one hour of transportation, while evacuation by pure nitrogen significantly improved the recovery of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius after 24 hours of transportation. In all other cases, however, no statistically significant effect on bacterial recovery was found.
