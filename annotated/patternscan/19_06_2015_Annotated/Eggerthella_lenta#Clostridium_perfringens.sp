TI  == cystathionine beta-synthase (cbs) domains confer multiple forms of mg2+-dependent cooperativity to family ii pyrophosphatases.
AB  == regulated family ii pyrophosphatases (cbs-ppases) contain a nucleotide-binding insert comprising a pair of cystathionine beta-synthase (cbs) domains, termed a bateman module. by binding with high affinity to the cbs domains, amp and adp usually inhibit the enzyme, whereas atp activates it. here, we demonstrate that amp, adp, and atp bind in a positively cooperative manner to cbs-ppases from four bacteria: desulfitobacterium hafniense, clostridium novyi, clostridium perfringens, and eggerthella lenta. enzyme interaction with substrate as characterized by the michaelis constant (km) also exhibited positive catalytic cooperativity that decreased in magnitude upon nucleotide binding. the degree of  both types of cooperativity increased with increasing concentration of the cofactor mg(2+) except for the c. novyi ppase where mg(2+) produced the opposite  effect on kinetic cooperativity. further exceptions from these general rules were adp binding to c. novyi ppase and amp binding to e. lenta ppase, neither of which had any effect on activity. a genetically engineered deletion variant of d. hafniense ppase lacking the regulatory insert was fully active but differed from  the wild-type enzyme in that it was insensitive to nucleotides and bound substrate non-cooperatively and with a smaller km value. these results indicate that the regulatory insert acts as an internal inhibitor and confers dual positive cooperativity to cbs domain-containing ppases, making them highly sensitive regulators of the ppi level in response to the changes in cell energy status that control adenine nucleotide distribution. these regulatory features may be common among other cbs domain-containing proteins.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of smt19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  == the comparative in vitro activity of smt19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined clostridium difficile strains, 174 gram-positive and 136 gram-negative intestinal anaerobes,  and 40 gram-positive aerobes. smt19969 was one dilution more active against c. difficile isolates (mic range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; mic90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; mic90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. smt19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against gram-negative anaerobes, especially the bacteroides fragilis group species, than  vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that smt19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. smt19969 showed limited activity against other gram-positive anaerobes, including bifidobacteria species, eggerthella lenta, finegoldia magna, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with mic90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with c. innocuum being susceptible (mic90, 1 mug/ml) and c. ramosum and c. perfringens being nonsusceptible (mic90, >512 mug/ml). activity against lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; mic90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. gram-positive aerobic cocci (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococci) showed high smt19969 mic90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).
