TI  - Probing of microbial biofilm communities for coadhesion partners.
AB  - Investigations of interbacterial adhesion in dental plaque development are currently limited by the lack of a convenient assay to screen the multitude of species present in oral biofilms. To overcome this limitation, we developed a solid-phase fluorescence-based screening method to detect and identify coadhesive partner organisms in mixed-species biofilms. The applicability of this method was demonstrated using coaggregating strains of type 2 fimbrial adhesin-bearing actinomyces and receptor polysaccharide (RPS)-bearing streptococci. Specific adhesin/receptor-mediated coadhesion was detected by overlaying bacterial strains immobilized to a nitrocellulose membrane with a suspended, fluorescein-labeled bacterial partner strain. Coadhesion was comparable regardless of which cell type was labeled and which was immobilized. Formaldehyde treatment of bacteria, either in suspension or immobilized on nitrocellulose, abolished actinomyces type 2 fimbrial adhesin but not streptococcal RPS function, thereby providing a simple method for assigning complementary adhesins and glycan receptors to members of a coadhering pair. The method's broader applicability was shown by overlaying colony lifts of dental plaque biofilm cultures with fluorescein-labeled strains of type 2 fimbriated Actinomyces naeslundii or RPS-bearing Streptococcus oralis. Prominent coadhesion partners included not only streptococci and actinomyces, as expected, but also other bacteria not identified in previous coaggregation studies, such as adhesin- or receptor-bearing strains of Neisseria pharyngitis, Rothia dentocariosa, and Kingella oralis. The ability to comprehensively screen complex microbial communities for coadhesion partners of specific microorganisms opens a new approach in studies of dental plaque and other mixed-species biofilms.
TI  - A novel selective medium for the isolation and distribution of Rothia dentocariosa in oral cavities.
AB  - Rothia dentocariosa is an indigenous microbial flora of dental plaque. To examine the bacterium population in oral cavities, a novel selective medium, designated RDSM, was developed for the isolation of R. dentocariosa. RDSM was prepared by adding 0.5 mug/ml of lincomycin, 10 mug/ml of colistin, and 40% sucrose to Heart Infusion (HI). Average growth recovery of R. dentocariosa on RDSM was 93.8% that of HI medium. Growth of other bacteria including Rothia mucilaginosa, Neisseria, Actinomyces, or streptococci was remarkably inhibited on the selective medium. Clinical efficacy was evaluated by the recovery of R. dentocariosa on RDSM from the stimulated saliva samples of 8 volunteers. R. dentocariosa was detected at 2.6 (range: 1.0-4.6) % to total bacteria of 8.0x10(7)CFU/ml on BHI in their oral cavities. The new selective medium, RDSM, was highly selective for R. dentocariosa and was useful for the isolation of R. dentocariosa from clinical samples.
TI  - Shifts in the microbial population in relation to in situ caries progression.
AB  - The shift in microbial diversity from young to mature plaque, related to caries activity on sound and restored surfaces, was studied using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. During a 20-week in situ study on caries progression 8 subjects wearing restored and unrestored dentin and enamel sections, biofilm was sampled after 1 and 20 weeks (young or mature plaque). A higher microbial diversity (mature plaque) was seen in caries-active compared to caries-free subjects. Rothia dentocariosa and Scardovia inopinata were absent from all caries-free sites, but appeared in 50% of the caries-active sites.
TI  - Detection of nine microorganisms from the initial carious root lesions using a TaqMan-based real-time PCR.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to quantify nine selected cariogenic bacteria in plaque from sound root surfaces and initial carious root lesions using TaqMan PCR and to analyse a putative dependence on the kind of initial periodontal treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-four subjects with generalized chronic periodontitis were randomly allocated to one of the following initial periodontal therapies: full-mouth disinfection, full-mouth scaling and root planing or scaling and root planing within 7 days. Plaque samples were taken before and after periodontal treatment and analysed by TaqMan PCR. RESULTS: The quantity of the cariogenic bacteria Actinomyces spp., Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacilllus spp., Rothia dentocariosa, Parvimonas micra, Propionibacterium acnes and Neisseria mucosa were significantly higher, while the quantity of Veillonella parvula was significantly lower on initial carious lesions than on the sound surfaces both before and after periodontal therapy. No significant differences could be found in any of the tested bacteria except P. micra on initial carious lesions and sound surfaces for both examinations between the groups. CONCLUSION: All the nine species analysed were found to be present in initial carious root lesions as well as sound root surfaces but in different quantities, independent of the different periodontal therapies.
TI  - Comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (RP) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (GRs = good responders) or periodontal health (PH) using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM). METHODS: At baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with PH and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM. The subjects with periodontitis were classified as having RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or more than three sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GRs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after treatment. Significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the Kruskal-Wallis and chi(2) tests. RESULTS: More species were detected in patients with disease (GR or RP) than in those without disease (PH). Subjects with RP were distinguished from GRs or those with PH by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Campylobacter gracilis, Eubacterium nodatum, Selenomonas noxia, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Treponema spp., and Eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, TM7 spp. oral taxon [OT] 346/356, Bacteroidetes sp. OT 272/274, Solobacterium moorei, Desulfobulbus sp. OT 041, Brevundimonas diminuta, Sphaerocytophaga sp. OT 337, Shuttleworthia satelles, Filifactor alocis, Dialister invisus/pneumosintes, Granulicatella adiacens, Mogibacterium timidum, Veillonella atypica, Mycoplasma salivarium, Synergistes sp. cluster II, and Acidaminococcaceae [G-1] sp. OT 132/150/155/148/135) (P <0.05). Species that were more prevalent in subjects with PH than in patients with periodontitis included Actinomyces sp. OT 170, Actinomyces spp. cluster I, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Lautropia mirabilis, Propionibacterium propionicum, Rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and Streptococcus sanguinis (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: As determined by HOMIM, patients with RP presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the GR and PH groups.
TI  - MLPA diagnostics of complex microbial communities: relative quantification of bacterial species in oral biofilms.
AB  - A multitude of molecular methods are currently used for identification and characterization of oral biofilms or for community profiling. However, multiplex PCR techniques that are able to routinely identify several species in a single assay are not available. Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) identifies up to 45 unique fragments in a single tube PCR. Here we report a novel use of MLPA in the relative quantification of targeted microorganisms in a community of oral microbiota. We designed 9 species specific probes for: Actinomyces gerencseriae, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Candida albicans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Rothia dentocariosa, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis and Veillonella parvula; and genus specific probes for selected oral Streptococci and Lactobacilli based on their 16S rDNA sequences. MLPA analysis of DNA pooled from the strains showed the expected specific MLPA products. Relative quantification of a serial dilution of equimolar DNA showed that as little as 10 pg templates can be detected with clearly discernible signals. Moreover, a 2 to 7% divergence in relative signal ratio of amplified probes observed from normalized peak area values suggests MLPA can be a cheaper alternative to using qPCR for quantification. We observed 2 to 6 fold fluctuations in signal intensities of MLPA products in DNAs isolated from multispecies biofilms grown in various media for various culture times. Furthermore, MLPA analyses of DNA isolated from saliva obtained from different donors gave a varying number and intensity of signals. This clearly shows the usefulness of MLPA in a quantitative description of microbial shifts.
TI  - Caries-related plaque microcosm biofilms developed in microplates.
AB  - In vivo dental plaque biofilms consist of complex communities of oral bacteria that are a challenge to replicate in vitro. The aim of this investigation was to establish human dental plaque microcosms in microplates to reflect conditions that are relevant to dental caries. Microcosm plaque biofilms were initiated from the saliva of two different donors, grown for up to 10 days in 24-welled microplates on Thermanox coverslips in various types of artificial saliva with and without sucrose, which were replaced daily. Microbiota composition of 40 species associated with oral health and dental caries was monitored in the plaques using Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization analysis. pH was measured as an indicator of cariogenic potential. The composition of the saliva inocula was different, and yielded plaque microcosms with different composition and growth responses to sucrose. Artificial saliva type and presence of sucrose, and the resulting growth and pH conditions, modified the growth of individual species and hence the ecological profile of the microplate plaques during development. Complex population shifts were observed during development, and older plaques comprised predominantly facultative anaerobic species. Sucrose supplementation limited the decline of Streptococci over time but did not increase the abundance of mutans Streptococci. Sucrose at 0.15% increased levels of caries-associated species including Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Actinomyces gerensceriae; these were further increased with sucrose at 0.5%, in addition to Actinomyces israelii, Rothia dentocariosa and Capnocytophaga gingivalis. The microplate plaques demonstrated complex community dynamics that appeared to reflect the maturation of natural plaques, and sucrose induced a cariogenic plaque composition and pH.
TI  - Evaluation of bacterial nitrate reduction in the human oral cavity.
AB  - It is hypothesized that the enterosalivary nitrate circulation encourages nitrate reducing bacteria to reside within the oral cavity. Nitrite production may then limit the growth of acidogenic bacteria as a result of the production of antimicrobial oxides of nitrogen, including nitric oxide. This study was carried out with 10 subjects to characterize oral nitrate reduction and identify the bacteria responsible. Nitrate reduction varied between individuals (mean 85.4 +/- 15.9 nmol nitrite min(-1) with 10 ml 1 mm KNO(3) mouth wash) and was found to be concentrated at the rear of the tongue dorsal surface. Nitrate reductase positive isolates identified, using 16S rDNA sequencing, from the tongue comprised Veillonella atypica (34%), Veillonella dispar (24%), Actinomyces odontolyticus (21%), Actinomyces naeslundii (2%), Rothia mucilaginosa (10%), Rothia dentocariosa (3%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (5%). Nitrite production rates, using intact and permeabilized cells, of the major tongue nitrate reducers were determined in the presence of methyl and benzyl viologen. Under anaerobic conditions in the presence of nitrate, rates in decreasing order were: A. odontolyticus > R. mucilaginosa > R. dentocariosa > V. dispar > V. atypica. In conclusion, Veillonella spp. were found to be the most prevalent taxa isolated and thus may make a major contribution to nitrate reduction in the oral cavity.
TI  - Comparison of the microbial composition of voice prosthesis biofilms from patients requiring frequent versus infrequent replacement.
AB  - This study was performed to establish a possible difference in biofilm composition in patients who require frequent versus infrequent prosthesis replacement. Only Groningen button voice prostheses that were removed because of increased airflow resistance or leakage of food or liquids through the prosthesis were considered for this study. These prostheses were selected from a total of 692 failed voice prostheses over a 2-year evaluation period. The failed voice prostheses were subdivided into a short-lifetime group, corresponding to an implantation period of less than 4 months (20 voice prostheses), and an extended-lifetime group, corresponding to an implantation period of greater than 9 months (18 voice prostheses). The biofilm was removed from the valve sides of the prostheses. The bacterial strain Rothia dentocariosa and the yeast strains Candida albicans I and Candida tropicalis were the predominant strains isolated from the biofilms on the voice prostheses in the short-lifetime group, whereas in the extended-lifetime group, R dentocariosa was found with a fourfold lower isolation frequency and C albicans I was found with a twofold lower isolation frequency. Candida tropicalis was absent from the extended-lifetime group.
TI  - Rothia dentocariosa endocarditis complicated by multiple intracranial hemorrhages.
AB  - Rothia dentocariosa is a gram-positive rod found commonly as part of the normal flora of the mouth. It rarely causes clinical disease. Subacute infective endocarditis has been the most commonly reported R dentocariosa infection, and extracardiac complications occur frequently. Solitary intracranial hemorrhages have been reported in two cases. We describe the first case of infective endocarditis complicated by the sequential and unusually prolonged development of multiple new intracranial hemorrhages.
TI  - Investigation of infectious organisms causing pericoronitis of the mandibular third molar.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to identify the most frequently encountered pyogenic organisms involved in pericoronitis to permit more targeted antibiotic therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pericoronal pockets of mandibular third molars from 37 patients showing symptoms of acute, severe pericoronitis were sampled and subjected to microbiologic analysis, including primary evaluation by phase-contrast microscopy. To avoid overgrowth with faster-growing, less fastidious organisms, specimens were cultured on a wide variety of selective media (supporting growth of fastidious bacteria, protozoa, and fungi). RESULTS: Microscopic examination indicated spirochetes in 55% and fusiform bacteria in 84% of the samples. A total of 441 microorganisms were isolated and identified from the 37 cultured samples. Besides obligate anaerobic bacteria, including various Actinomyces and Prevotella species, a predominantly facultative anaerobic microflora was cultivated, that is, Streptococcus milleri group (78% of samples), Stomatococcus mucilaginosus (71%), and Rothia dentocariosa (57%). CONCLUSION: It was concluded that the Streptococci milleri group bacteria, well-known for their ability to cause suppurative infections, are most likely involved in the pathogenesis of acute severe pericoronitis of the lower third molar.
TI  - Cellular fatty acid composition and phenotypic and cultural characterization of CDC fermentative coryneform groups 3 and 5.
AB  - Seventy strains of fermentative, asporogenous, gram-positive coccobacilli or short rods form two closely related groups which have been designated CDC fermentative coryneform groups 3 (32 strains, xylose fermenters) and 5 (38 strains, xylose nonfermenters). The two taxa are otherwise similar to each other phenotypically and culturally and by a distinctive Staphylococcus-like odor and by cellular fatty acid (CFA) composition. CDC group 3 and CDC group 5 strains have been isolated from clinical sources (blood, abscesses, and wounds but not urine or respiratory specimens) in Canada and the United States and among referrals from Belgium, Sweden, and Spain. Coryneform CDC group 3 strains were phenotypically similar to CDC coryneform group A-3 but were distinguishable by their inability to reduce nitrate and by their lack of motility. Coryneform CDC group 5 isolates were phenotypically somewhat similar to Actinomyces viscosus and Rothia dentocariosa, except that none of this group reduced nitrate. Both CDC groups could be differentiated from these similar bacteria by the ability to decarboxylate lysine and ornithine. The CFA compositions of CDC group 3 and 5 strains were similar to each other, were distinctive from those of other coryneforms, and were of the branched-chain type. API CORYNE codes were consistent for both CDC group 3 and CDC group 5 bacteria, suggesting that this method could be useful as an identification method.
TI  - Cellular fatty acid composition as an adjunct to the identification of asporogenous, aerobic gram-positive rods.
AB  - Cellular fatty acid (CFA) compositions of 561 asporogenous, aerobic gram-positive rods were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography as an adjunct to their identification when grown on blood agar at 35 degrees C. The organisms could be divided into two groups. In the first group (branched-chain type), which included coryneform CDC groups A-3, A-4, and A-5; some strains of B-1 and B-3; "Corynebacterium aquaticum"; Brevibacterium liquefaciens; Rothia dentocariosa; and Listeria spp., the rods had sizable quantities of antiesopentadecanoic (Ca15:0) and anteisoheptadecanoic (Ca17:0) acids. Other species with these types of CFA included B. acetylicum, which contained large amounts of isotridecanoic (Ci13:0) and anteisotridecanoic (Ca13:0) acids. CFAs useful for distinguishing among Jonesia denitrificans, Oerskovia spp., some strains of CDC groups B-1 and B-3, Kurthia spp., and Propionibacterium avidum were hexadecanoic (C 16:0) acid, isopentadecanoic (Ci15:0) acid, and Ca15:0). The second group (straight-chained type), which included Actinomyces pyogenes; Arcanobacterium haemolyticum; C. bovis; C. cystitidis; C. diphtheriae; C. flavescens, "C. gentalium"; C. jeikeium; C. kutscheri; C. matruchotii; C .minutissimum; C. mycetoides; C. pilosum; C. pseudodiphtheriticum; "C. pseudogenitalium"; C. pseudotuberculosis; C. renale; CDC groups 1, 2, ANF-1, D-2, E, F-1, F-2, G-1, G-2, and I-2; C. striatum; "C. tuberculostearicum"; C. ulcerans; C. vitarumen; C. xerosis; and Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, was typified by significant quantities of hexadecanoic (C16:0) and oleic acids (C18:cis9), with differences in the amounts of linoleic acid (C18:2), stearic acid (C18:0), an unnamed peak (equivalent chain length, 14.966), and small quantities of other known saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. CFA composition of these organisms was sufficiently discriminatory to assist in classification but could not be used as the sole means of identification.
TI  - Glucanase-producing organisms in human dental plaques.
AB  - Selective media were used to isolate a wide range of bacteria from sixty human dental plaques. Glucanase activities of the isolates were determined on dextran- and starch-containing media. All sixty samples of dental plaque yielded some colonies showing amylolytic and dextranolytic activities. The glucanase-producing organisms comprised 20% of the isolates. Of these 38% were Gram-positive rods, 27% Gram-positive cocci, 28% Gram-negative rods and 7% were Gram-negative cocci. The cultural groups most commonly represented among the glucanase-producing isolates were Actinomycetaceae, streptococci, haemophili and Gram-negative anaerobes. Species prominent among these isolates included Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitior, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces viscosus, Bacterionema matruchotii, Bifidobacterium sp. and Bacteroides sp. No isolates capable of degrading starch or dextran were identified as Streptococcus milleri, Rothia dentocariosa or Fusobacterium sp. This study has shown that a wide range of bacterial species commonly isolated from human dental plaques exhibit both amylolytic and dextranolytic activities. In order to understand glucan metabolism in human dental plaques further investigation of these catabolic activities is necessary.
TI  - Coaggregation of oral Bacteroides species with other bacteria: central role in coaggregation bridges and competitions.
AB  - Seventy-three freshly isolated oral strains representing 10 Bacteroides spp. were tested for their ability to coaggregate with other oral gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. None coaggregated with any of the gram-negative strains tested, which included Capnocytophaga gingivalis, C. ochracea, C. sputigena, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Strains of Bacteroides buccae, B. melaninogenicus, B. oralis, and B. gingivalis failed to coaggregate with any of the gram-positive strains tested. However, six Bacteroides spp. coaggregated with one or more species of gram-positive bacteria. Most isolates of B. buccalis, B. denticola, B. intermedius, B. loescheii, B. oris, and B. veroralis coaggregated with strains of Actinomyces israelii, A. viscosus, A. naeslundii, A. odontolyticus, Rothia dentocariosa, or Streptococcus sanguis. The strongest coaggregations involved B. denticola, B. loescheii, or B. oris; 22 of 25 strains coaggregated with A. israelii. Only B. loescheii interacted with certain strains of S. sanguis; these coaggregations were lactose inhibitable and were like coaggregations between A. viscosus and the same strains of S. sanguis. In fact, B. loescheii and A. viscosus were competitors for binding to S. sanguis. Many bacteroides also acted as coaggregation bridges by mediating coaggregations between two noncoaggregating cell types (e.g., S. sanguis and A. israelii). Evidence for binding-site competition and coaggregation bridging involving noncoaggregating cell types from three different genera provides support for the hypothesis that these intergeneric cell-to-cell interactions have an active role in bacterial colonization of the oral cavity.
TI  - A numerical taxonomic study of members of the Actinomycetaceae and related taxa.
AB  - Two hundred and twenty-two representatives of the Actinomycetaceae and related taxa, including reference cultures, received strains and fresh isolates, were tested using 124 unit characters. The data were examined using numerical taxonomic techniques with various coefficients and average linkage clustering; the variation in composition of the clusters obtained from the different coefficients was slight. Most species included in the study formed discrete phena, which exhibited good differential characters. Actinomyces israelii was particularly well-defined and A. naeslundii and A. viscosus, although grouping together, did show divergence in several test results. Actinomyces bovis was initially linked with representatives of genera other than Actinomyces, these being Bifidobacterium, Corynebacterium pyogenes and Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae. The strains of Bacterionema matruchotii and Rothia dentocariosa formed tight distinct clusters associated only at low similarity levels with other members of the family Actinomycetaceae. The Arachnia propionica phenon, although well-defined, appeared to consist of two subclusters which could be assigned to serotypes 1 and 2. Tests which may be useful in identification are tabulated and the relationships between the various taxa are discussed.
TI  - Role of surface fimbriae (fibrils) in the adsorption of Actinomyces species to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite surfaces.
AB  - We studied the adsorption, morphological, and serological characteristics of selected Actinomyces and related species. Evaluation of uranyl acetate-stained cells by electron microscopy revealed wide variations among strains in the frequency of surface fimbriae. These variations did not always correlate with the percent adsorption to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite of the various Actinomyces strains. However, two strains of Rothia dentocariosa possessing no surface fimbriae and five strains of A. israelii possessing very few surface fimbriae exhibited feeble adsorption to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite. Although the calculated number of adsorption sites on saliva-treated hydroxypatite did not vary widely among the strains tested, significant differences were observed in the affinities calculated for some species or serotypes. The mean affinities for strains of A. viscosus serotype 2 and A. naeslundii serotype 3 were similar, and these strains adsorbed well to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite. The mean adsorption and affinity for the A. naeslundii strain serotype 1 and all strains of A. israelii tested were significantly less than those determined for the A. viscosus serotype 2 or A. naeslundii serotype 3 strains. Adsorption inhibition activity of antiserum to strain T14V, previously shown to be solely related to antibodies in immune serum directed against the VA1 fimbria (fibril) antigen, was removed by preadsorption of the antiserum with most A. viscosus and A. naelundii strains, but not with A. israelii strains. This suggests some cross-reactivity among strains of A. viscosus and A. naeslundii but not A. israelii. Adsorption to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite of all A. viscosus and A. naeslundii strains tested was strongly inhibited by fimbriae isolated from A. viscosus strain T14V. Collectively, these data suggest that the adsorption of certain A. viscosus and A. naeslundii strains is mediated by surface fimbriae, many of which appear serologically cross-reactive with strain T14V fimbriae.
TI  - Aerobic gram-positive pleomorphic rods isolated from dental plaque and gingival crevice.
AB  - A typical gram-positive pleomorphic aerobe is Rothia dentocariosa. However, there exist many organisms having similar characteristics (Rothia-like organisms). The purpose of this study is to isolate Rothia dentocariosa and Rothia-like organisms from the healthy and diseased sites of the oral cavity and to clarify the characteristics of those organisms. A total of 342 strains were isolated in this study, and 188 strains were identified as gram-positive pleomorphic rods. Seventy-seven typical strains of 188 isolates were examined physiologically and biochemically, and they were classified as follows: 1) 20 strains of A. viscosus; 2) 3 strains of A. naeslundii; 3) 26 strains of Rothia dentocariosa; 4) 2 strains of Bacterionema matruchotii; 5) 15 strains of Corynebacterium; 6) 7 strains of Nocardia; and 4 unknown strains. The strains of Rothia dentocariosa were mainly isolated from the dental plaque (24 of 26 isolates), and they had the ability to adhere on to the glass surface, and 5 of 26 strains of Rothia dentocariosa showed the ability of gelatin liquefaction.
TI  - A study of the bacteria associated with advancing periodontitis in man.
AB  - Samples of apical plaque were taken by means of an anaerobic gas-flushed syringe  from 21 sites in eight patients. The samples were anaerobically dispersed, diluted and plated and incubated in an atmosphere of 80% N2, 10% H2 and 10% CO2 for 7-21 days. All colonies on plates containing 20-50 isolates were picked, repeatedly restreaked, characterized and identified where possible by a probabilistic computer identification program. The sites were divided into four groups on the basis of clinical features. The significance of differences between bacterial populations in the groups was determined by the Kruskal Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests, while the Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to determine the rank correlation of clinical features of diseases and microbial species. The subgingival microbiota in advanced destructive sites was predominated by Gram-negative rods. The microbiota of two young adult patients with generalized extensive bone loss, extensive clinical inflammation and suppuration was dominated by Bacteroides asaccharolyticus and an organism with characteristics consistent with Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. The predominant cultivable microbiota in two patients with extensive bone loss but minimal clinical inflammation was predominated by Bacteroides melaninogenicus ss intermedius and Eikenella corrodens in one patient and E. corrodens and a slow growing fusiform-shaped Bacteroides in a second patient. A third group of four patients demonstrated moderate levels of clinical inflammation and evidence of continued bone loss in the last year. Predominant organisms in this group were more heterogeneous and included B. asaccharolyticus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, the "fusiform" Bacteroides and anaerobic vibrios. Sites with minimal disease in the patients revealed higher proportions of Gram-positive organisms including Rothia dentocariosa, Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces viscosus. A positive rank correlation could be detected between clinical inflammation including suppuration and B. asaccharolyticus and a negative rank correlation between inflammation and E. corrodens.
TI  - Regulation of lactate dehydrogenase activity in Rothia dentocariosa by fructose 1,6-diphosphate and adenosine 5'-triphosphate.
AB  - The L-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase from Rothia dentocariosa strain 17931 is activated by fructose 1,6-diphosphate and inhibited by adenosine 5'-triphosphate. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 120,000. In these respects, it resembles the lactate dehydrogenase of Actinomyces viscosus.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy and laboratory identification of Bacterionema matruchotii, Rothia dentocariosa, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces viscosus, and some related bacteria.
TI  - The pathogenicity of Rothia dentocariosa inoculated into mice.
TI  - Laboratory identification of Rothia dentocariosa and its occurrence in human clinical materials.
AB  - Fifty isolates of Rothia dentocariosa from diverse clinical sources were characterized by 28 separate tests. An attempt was made to select practical tests that could be completed in a minimal length of time. Rothia is also compared with Actinomyces and Nocardia with which it is often confused. Of the isolates 100% were positive in the following reactions: catalase production, nitrate and nitrite reduction, esculin hydrolysis, and acid production from glucose, sucrose, maltose, salicin, and glycerol. The importance of recognizing this organism is based on the fact that it is frequently isolated from human clinical materials and must be differentiated from morphologically similar organisms of the genera Actinomyces and Nocardia, which contain pathogenic members.
