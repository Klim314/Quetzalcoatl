TI  == pyrosequencing analysis of microbial community and food-borne bacteria on restaurant cutting boards collected in seri kembangan, malaysia, and their correlation with grades of food premises.
AB  == this study adopts the pyrosequencing technique to identify bacteria present on 26 kitchen cutting boards collected from different grades of food premises around seri kembangan, a city in malaysia. pyrosequencing generated 452,401 of total reads of otus with an average of 1.4x10(7) bacterial cells/cm(2). proteobacteria, firmicutes and bacteroides were identified as the most abundant phyla in the samples. taxonomic richness was generally high with >1000 operational taxonomic units (otus) observed across all samples. the highest appearance frequencies (100%) were otus closely related to enterobacter sp., enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas sp. and pseudomonas putida. several otus were identified most closely related to known food-borne pathogens, including bacillus cereus, cronobacter sakazaki, cronobacter turisensis, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, hafnia alvei, kurthia gibsonii, salmonella bongori, salmonella enterica, salmonella paratyphi, salmonella tyhpi, salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica ranging from 0.005% to 0.68% relative abundance. the condition and grade of the food premises on a three point cleanliness scale did not correlate with the bacterial abundance and type. regardless of the status and grades, all food premises have the same likelihood to introduce food-borne bacteria from cutting boards to their foods and must always prioritize the correct food handling procedure in order to avoid unwanted outbreak of food-borne illnesses.

TI  == effect of white mustard essential oil on the growth of foodborne pathogens and spoilage microorganisms and the effect of food components on its efficacy.
AB  == antimicrobial preservative compounds are added to foods to target specific pathogens and spoilage organisms. white mustard essential oil (wmeo) is an extract that contains 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate, a compound which has been demonstrated to have antimicrobial activity in limited studies. the objective of  this research was to determine the in vitro antimicrobial activity of wmeo against gram-positive and gram-negative spoilage and pathogenic bacteria and determine the effect of food components on the antimicrobial activity. the bacteria escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, enterobacter  aerogenes, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, and lactobacillus fermentum, as well as the acid- and preservative-resistant yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe, were evaluated. all microorganisms were inhibited by wmeo at 8.3 g/liter (equivalent to 1,000 mg/liter 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate). in general, wmeo was more effective against gram-negative than against gram-positive bacteria. salmonella enteritidis and s. pombe were the most sensitive, with inhibition at as low as 2.1 g/liter. the effects on growth profiles varied but included increased lag phases and lethality, indicating both  bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity. soybean oil had a negative effect on the efficacy of wmeo against l. monocytogenes, and at 5% soybean oil, the antimicrobial activity against salmonella enteritidis was eliminated after 48 h.  sodium caseinate at 1% also negated the antimicrobial effect of wmeo against salmonella enteritidis and decreased its effectiveness against l. monocytogenes.  the presence of starch had no significant effect on the antimicrobial activity of wmeo against l. monocytogenes and salmonella enteritidis. thus, wmeo is effective against a wide range of microorganisms and has potential to be used in foods, depending upon the target microorganism and food components present.

TI  == synthesis, characterization, theoretical, anti-bacterial and molecular docking studies of quinoline based chalcones as a dna gyrase inhibitor.
AB  == a series of fourteen (a1-a14) new qunioline based chalcones were synthesized by condensing 2,7-dichloro-8-methyl-3-formyl quinoline with acetophenone and acetylthiophenes, and subsequently characterized by ir, nmr and mass spectroscopy. all the compounds were screened for antibacterial activities and found potentially active antibacterial agents. bioassay, theoretical and dockings studies with dna gyrase (the enzyme required for super coiling of dna of bacteria) results showed that the type and positions of the substituents seemed to be critical for their antibacterial activities. the bromo and chloro substituted chalcone displayed high anti-bacterial activity. the a4 and a6 showed high interaction with dna gyrase, contributing high free binding energy (deltag -8.18 and -8.88 kcal).

TI  == discovery and biological characterization of geranylated rna in bacteria.
AB  == a general ms-based screen for unusually hydrophobic cellular small molecule-rna conjugates revealed geranylated rna in escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes,  pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica var. typhimurium. the geranyl group is conjugated to the sulfur atom in two 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine nucleotides. these geranylated nucleotides occur in the first anticodon position  of trna(glu)(uuc), trna(lys)(uuu) and trna(gln)(uug) at a frequency of up to 6.7% (~400 geranylated nucleotides per cell). rna geranylation can be increased or abolished by mutation or deletion of the selu (ybbb) gene in e. coli, and purified selu protein in the presence of geranyl pyrophosphate and trna can produce geranylated trna. the presence or absence of the geranyl group in trna(glu)(uuc), trna(lys)(uuu) and trna(gln)(uug) affects codon bias and frameshifting during translation. these rnas represent the first reported examples of oligoisoprenylated cellular nucleic acids.

TI  == thymus maroccanus essential oil, a membranotropic compound active on gram-negative bacteria and resistant isolates.
AB  == aims: the effects of thymus maroccanus essential oil (eo) on the integrity of the cell membranes and the permeability of the outer membrane (om) and inner membrane (im) of escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes and salmonella enterica typhimurium were investigated. methods and results: the bacterial release of intracellular proteins, cytoplasmic beta-galactosidase and periplasmic beta-lactamase induced by t. maroccanus eo was compared to the membranotropic activity of polymyxin b (pb) known as an effective permeabilizer of the membrane  of gram-negative bacteria. results showed that t. maroccanus eo increased the permeability of the om and im of studied bacteria and induced the release of intracellular proteins into the external medium. conclusions: the effect of t. maroccanus eo on the outer membrane was comparable to that of pb, and both t. maroccanus eo and pb induce similar levels of beta-lactamase release. in addition, it also promoted the release of the cytoplasmic beta-galactosidase. moreover, the lipopolysaccharide molecules and the overexpression of efflux pumps seem to play a crucial role in the level of susceptibility of studied bacteria to the permeabilizing effect of t. maroccanus eo. significance and impact of study:  these results demonstrate that t. maroccanus eo can restore antibiotic activity by targeting the two bacterial membranes and would be attractive candidates for developing new adjuvants for combating resistant gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == essential oils from moroccan plants as potential chemosensitisers restoring antibiotic activity in resistant gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == bacterial drug resistance is a worrying public health problem. antibiotic efflux  is a major non-specific resistance mechanism used by bacteria, and efflux pumps are involved in the low-level susceptibility of various important gram-negative pathogens. use of molecules that can block bacterial pumps is an attractive strategy, but several studies report only partial efficacy owing to limits of these molecules (stability, selectivity, bioavailability, toxicity, etc.). the objective of this study was to search for natural sources of molecules able to inhibit efflux pump systems of resistant gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium and pseudomonas aeruginosa). the results indicate that the studied essential oils exhibit interesting activity against the tested bacteria. this activity was significantly enhanced in the presence of an efflux pump inhibitor such as phenylalanine arginyl beta-naphthylamide (pabetan). the role of lipopolysaccharide (lps) structure in the effect of essential oils was also reported in salmonella lps deep-rough mutants. in addition, essential oils of thymus maroccanus and thymus broussonetii, used at a low concentration (a fraction of the minimum inhibitory concentration), are able to significantly increase chloramphenicol susceptibility of several resistant isolates. these results demonstrate that these essential oils can alter efflux pump activity and  may be attractive candidates to develop new drugs for chemosensitising multidrug-resistant strains to clinically used antibiotics.

TI  == combining capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence detection for the analysis of escherichia coli lysates.
AB  == with the goal of improving water quality control, in this study we combined ce-lif for the analysis of escherichia coli lysates under discontinuous conditions. prior to injecting a large-volume protein sample, a plug of 0.2% w/v  sds was injected into the capillary filled with 2.0 m tris-borate (tb) solution (ph 10.3). during the courses of the process stacking, proteins migrated against  the electroosmotic flow (eof) and entered a 1.7% w/v poly(ethylene oxide) solution that has been prepared in 200 mm tb (ph 9.0). the stacked proteins were  then separated through sieving and then detected at the cathodic end. the use of  tb solutions containing 0.01% w/v poly(ethylene oxide) was essential for the preparation of the protein samples and e. coli lysates to minimize the extent of  protein adsorption on the capillary wall. under the optimized ce-lif conditions,  we detected beta-galactosidase with and without concentration at levels as low as 0.23 and 7.52 nm, respectively. our approach allowed the detection of 3 x 10(2) e. coli cells based on the characteristic peaks of its lysates; in addition, we could detect the presence of 20 e. coli cells in a 50 ml sample of pond water within 24 h. in terms of the analyte migration time, the relative standard deviation of this ce-lif method was less than 1.3%. we also extended the practicality of this technique by applying it to the separation of mixtures of e. coli, enterobacter aerogenes, and salmonella enterica.

TI  == membrane permeability and regulation of drug "influx and efflux" in enterobacterial pathogens.
AB  == in enterobacteriaceae, membrane permeability is a key in the level of susceptibility to antibiotics. modification of the bacterial envelope by decreasing the porin production or increasing the expression of efflux pump systems has been reported. these phenomena are frequently associated with other resistance mechanisms such as alteration of antibiotics or modification of the drug targets, in various clinical isolates showing a multi drug resistant phenotype (mdr). in escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella enterica several genes and external factors are involved in the emergence of mdr isolates. these bacterial isolates exhibit a noticeable reduction of functional porins per cell due to a decrease, a complete  shutdown of synthesis, or the expression of an altered porin and a high expression of efflux systems (e.g. overexpression of the pump). the combined action of these mechanisms during an infection confers a significant decrease in  bacterial sensitivity to antibiotherapy ensuring dissemination and colonization of the patient and favours the acquisition of additional mechanisms of resistance. mara and rama are involved in a complex regulation cascade controlling membrane permeability and actively participate in the triggering of the mdr phenotype. mutations in regulator genes have been shown to induce the overproduction of efflux and the down-regulation of porin synthesis. in addition, various compounds such as salicylate, imipenem or chloramphenicol are able to activate the mdr response. this phenomenon has been observed both in vitro during culture of bacteria in the presence of drugs and in vivo during antibiotic treatment of infected patients. these effectors activate the expression of specific global regulators, mara, rama, or target other genes located downstream  in the regulation cascade.

TI  == bacteriocin-producing lactobacillus strains isolated from poto poto, a congolese  fermented maize product, and genetic fingerprinting of their plantaricin operons.
AB  == thirty one bacteriocin-producing lactobacillus isolates were identified among 135 lactobacilli isolated from the congolese fermented maize product poto poto, during the preparation and from the finished product. using species-specific pcr  and 16s rrna gene sequencing, 28 and 3 isolates were identified as l. plantarum and l. fermentum, respectively. cluster analysis of rapd-pcr fingerprints revealed two main groups (g1 and g2) plus the l. fermentum isolate c4-13. group g1 contained 23 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 74.5%, and could be divided in two subgroups (g1-1, g1-2) each with several branches, plus the l. plantarum isolate c11. group g2 contained 8 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 86%, with two main branches. using pcr amplification with specific  primers, several genes of the plantaricin cluster found in l. plantarum c11 were  identified in the isolates. the number of genes that were detected varied between the strains. the l. fermentum isolate ec11 also contained the plndefg genes. pcr  amplification of dna from isolates with primers directed to the upstream and downstream region of the plantaricin cluster generated an amplicon identical to that obtained with dna from the control strain l. plantarum wcfs1. amplification  products from the positive strains were used for restriction analysis with hindiii, ecori and kpni in separate reactions. cluster analysis of restriction profiles revealed high similarities for ecori and hindii digest profiles, and an  identical profile for all kpni digests. the l. fermentum ec11 isolate clustered with l. plantarum strains in a group with a high correlation coefficient. the results suggest a low degree of diversity in the plantarincin gene cluster. however, other strains that tested positive for individual plantaricin genes may  present great heterogeneity in the plantaricin operons. because of their broad spectra of inhibition (including escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, enterobacter aerogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, and enterococcus faecalis), isolates from the present study could  be used to improve the safety and storage stability of poto poto.

TI  == combined physico-chemical treatments based on enterocin as-48 for inactivation of gram-negative bacteria in soybean sprouts.
AB  == enterocin as-48 was tested for decontamination of soybean sprouts against gram-negative bacteria. although treatment with bacteriocin alone had no effect on salmonella enterica, a synergistic antimicrobial effect was detected at ph 9.0 and in combination with moderate heat treatment. greatest inactivation was achieved for sprouts heated for 5 min at 65 degrees c in an alkaline (ph 9.0) enterocin as-48 solution of 25 microg/ml. bactericidal activity against s. enterica increased greatly when enterocin as-48 was used in washing solutions in  combination with several chemical compounds: edta, lactic acid, peracetic acid, polyphosphoric acid, sodium hypochlorite, hexadecylpyridinium chloride, propyl-p-hydroxybenzoate, and hydrocinnamic acid. the combined treatment of enterocin as-48 and polyphosphoric acid was tested against several other gram-negative bacteria inoculated on sprouts. the bacteria tested showed great differences in sensitivity to polyphosphoric acid, but synergism with enterocin as-48 was confirmed in all cases. combinations of enterocin as-48 (25 microg/ml)  and polyphosphoric acid in a concentration range of 0.1 to 2.0% significantly reduced or inhibited growth of the populations of s. enterica, escherichia coli o157:h7, shigella spp., enterobacter aerogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, aeromonas hydrophila and pseudomonas fluorescens in sprout samples stored at 6 degrees c and 15 degrees c. the combined treatment could therefore be applied to  reduce the risks of gram-negative pathogenic as well as spoilage bacteria on sprouts.

TI  == hypoxia-independent activation of hif-1 by enterobacteriaceae and their siderophores.
AB  == background & aims: hypoxia inducible factor-1 (hif-1) is the key transcriptional  regulator during adaptation to hypoxia. recent studies provide evidence for hif-1 activation during bacterial infections. however, molecular details of how bacteria activate hif-1 remain unclear. here, we pursued the role of bacterial siderophores in hif-1 activation during infection with enterobacteriaceae. methods: in vivo, hif-1 activation and hif-1-dependent gene induction in peyer's  patches were analyzed after orogastric infection with yersinia enterocolitica. the course of an orogastric y enterocolitica infection was determined using mice  with a deletion of hif-1alpha in the intestine. in vitro, the mechanism of hif-1  activation was analyzed in infections with y enterocolitica, salmonella enterica  subsp enterica, and enterobacter aerogenes. results: infection of mice with y enterocolitica led to functional activation of hif-1 in peyer's patches. because  mice with deletion of hif-1alpha in the intestinal epithelium showed a significantly higher susceptibility to orogastric y enterocolitica infections, bacterial hif-1 activation appears to represent a host defense mechanism. additional studies with y enterocolitica, s enterica subsp enterica, or e aerogenes, and, moreover, application of their siderophores (yersiniabactin, salmochelin, aerobactin) caused a robust, dose-dependent hif-1 response in human  epithelia and endothelia, independent of cellular hypoxia. hif-1 activation occurs most likely because of inhibition of prolylhydroxylase activity and is abolished upon infection with siderophore uptake deficient bacteria. conclusions: taken together, this study reveals what we believe to be a previously unrecognized role of bacterial siderophores for hypoxia-independent activation of hif-1 during infection with human pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == type 3 fimbriae, encoded by the conjugative plasmid pola52, enhance biofilm formation and transfer frequencies in enterobacteriaceae strains.
AB  == the conjugative plasmid pola52, which confers resistance to olaquindox and other  antimicrobial agents through a multidrug efflux pump, was investigated for its ability to promote biofilm formation in escherichia coli. screening of a transposon-mutagenized pola52 clone library revealed several biofilm-deficient mutants, which all mapped within a putative operon with high homology to the mrkabcdf operon of klebsiella pneumoniae, where these genes are responsible for type 3 fimbriae expression, attachment to surfaces and biofilm formation. biofilm formation in microtitre plates and in urinary catheters of clones containing pola52 with a disrupted putative mrk operon was reduced by more than 100-fold and 2-fold, respectively, compared to mutants with an intact mrk operon. the conjugative transfer rate of pola52 was also significantly lower when the mrk operon was disrupted. through reverse transcriptase analysis, it was demonstrated that the genes contained in the putative mrk operon were linked and likely to be  expressed as a single operon. immunoblotting with type 3 fimbriae (mrka)-specific antibodies further verified expression of type 3 fimbriae. when transferred to other, potentially pathogenic, members of the family enterobacteriaceae, including klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhimurium, kluyvera sp. and enterobacter aerogenes, pola52 facilitated increased biofilm formation. pola52 is believed to represent the first example of a conjugative plasmid encoding type 3  fimbriae, resulting in enhanced conjugation frequencies and biofilm formation of  the plasmid-harbouring strain.

TI  == cloning, nucleotide sequencing, and analysis of the acrab-tolc efflux pump of enterobacter cloacae and determination of its involvement in antibiotic resistance in a clinical isolate.
AB  == enterobacter cloacae is an emerging clinical pathogen that may be responsible for nosocomial infections. management of these infections is often difficult, owing to the high frequency of strains that are resistant to disinfectants and antimicrobial agents in the clinical setting. multidrug efflux pumps, especially  those belonging to the resistance-nodulation-division family, play a major role as a mechanism of antimicrobial resistance in gram-negative pathogens. in the present study, we cloned and sequenced the genes encoding an acracb-tolc-like efflux pump from an e. cloacae clinical isolate (isolate ecdc64) showing a broad  antibiotic resistance profile. sequence analysis showed that the acrr, acra, acrb, and tolc genes encode proteins that display 79.8%, 84%, 88%, and 82% amino  acid identities with the respective homologues of enterobacter aerogenes and are  arranged in a similar pattern. deletion of the acra gene to yield an acra-deficient ecdc64 mutant (ecdeltaacra) showed the involvement of acrab-tolc in multidrug resistance in e. cloacae. however, experiments with an efflux pump inhibitor suggested that additional efflux systems also play a role in antibiotic resistance. investigation of several unrelated isolates of e. cloacae by pcr analysis revealed that the acrab system is apparently ubiquitous in this species.

TI  == the distribution of acetohydroxyacid synthase in soil bacteria.
AB  == most bacteria possess the enzyme acetohydroxyacid synthase, which is used to produce branched-chain amino acids. enteric bacteria contain several isozymes suited to different conditions, but the distribution of acetohydroxyacid synthase in soil bacteria is largely unknown. growth experiments confirmed that escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium, and enterobacter aerogenes contain isozymes of acetohydroxyacid synthase, allowing the bacteria to grow in the presence of valine (which causes feedback inhibition of ahas i) or the sulfonylurea herbicide triasulfuron (which inhibits ahas ii) although a slight lag phase was observed in growth in the latter case. several common soil isolates were inhibited by triasulfuron, but pseudomonas fluorescens and rhodococcus erythropolis were not inhibited by any combination of triasulfuron and valine. the extent of sulfonylurea-sensitive acetohydroxyacid synthase in soil was revealed when 21 out of 27 isolated bacteria in pure culture were inhibited by triasulfuron, the addition of isoleucine and/or valine reversing the effect in 19 cases. primers were designed to target the genes encoding the large  subunits (ilvb, ilvg and ilvi) of acetohydroxyacid synthase from available sequence data and a approximately 355 bp fragment in bacillus subtilis, arthrobacter globiformis, e. coli and s. enterica was subsequently amplified. the primers were used to create a small clone library of sequences from an agricultural soil. phylogenetic analysis revealed significant sequence variation, but all 19 amino acid sequences were most closely related to published large subunit acetohydroxyacid synthase amino acid sequences within several phyla including the proteobacteria and actinobacteria. the results suggested the majority of soil microorganisms contain only one functional acetohydroxyacid synthase enzyme sensitive to sulfonylurea herbicides.

AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen of the human urinary tract, and other selected human endogenous bacteria were investigated for metabolic activation of the bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene (2-af), 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ab), and benzidine (bz). the cell-free extracts of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, klebsiella pneumoniae,  and intestinal anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and eubacterium aerofaciens produced increased histidine revertant frequencies with the tester strain salmonella typhimurium ta98 in the ames salmonella mutagenicity assay. in addition, the cell-free extracts of pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, and eubacterium aerofaciens each showed the presence of a cytochrome p450 absorption peak in the carbon monoxide (co) difference spectrum. this was not demonstratable for the other bacteria. our findings indicate that human endogenous bacteria, which are opportunistic pathogens of the urinary bladder, can metabolically activate the bladder procarcinogens 2-af, 4-ab, and bz into mutagens. the metabolic activation by pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, and eubacterium aerofaciens is mediated by a cytochrome p450 enzyme. for those organisms that induced metabolic activation but did not show a p450 absorption peak with the cell-free extracts, other oxidative enzymes may be involved.

TI  == chloramphenicol and expression of multidrug efflux pump in enterobacter aerogenes.
AB  == chloramphenicol has been reported to act as an inducer of the multidrug resistance in escherichia coli. a resistant variant able to grow on plates containing 64 microg/ml chloramphenicol was obtained from the enterobacter aerogenes atcc 13048-type strain. chloramphenicol resistance was due to an active efflux of this antibiotic and it was associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones and tetracycline, but not to aminoglycoside or beta-lactam antibiotics. mdr in the chloramphenicol-resistant variant is linked to the overexpression of the major acrab-tolc efflux system. this overexpression seems unrelated to the global mar and the local acrr regulatory pathways.

TI  == detection of low levels of listeria monocytogenes cells by using a fiber-optic immunosensor.
AB  == biosensor technology has a great potential to meet the need for sensitive and nearly real-time microbial detection from foods. an antibody-based fiber-optic biosensor to detect low levels of listeria monocytogenes cells following an enrichment step was developed. the principle of the sensor is a sandwich immunoassay where a rabbit polyclonal antibody was first immobilized on polystyrene fiber waveguides through a biotin-streptavidin reaction to capture listeria cells on the fiber. capture of cells on the fibers was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. a cyanine 5-labeled murine monoclonal antibody, c11e9, was used to generate a specific fluorescent signal, which was acquired by  launching a 635-nm laser light from an analyte 2000 and collected by a photodetector at 670 to 710 nm. this immunosensor was specific for l. monocytogenes and showed a significantly higher signal strength than for other listeria species or other microorganisms, including escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, salmonella enterica, lactobacillus plantarum, carnobacterium gallinarum, hafnia alvei, corynebacterium glutamicum, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens, in pure or in mixed-culture setup. fiber-optic results could be obtained within 2.5 h of sampling. the sensitivity threshold was about 4.3 x 10(3) cfu/ml for a pure culture of l. monocytogenes grown at 37 degrees c. when l. monocytogenes was mixed with lactic acid bacteria or grown at 10 degrees c with 3.5% nacl, the detection threshold was 4.1 x 10(4) or 2.8 x 10(7) cfu/ml, respectively. in less  than 24 h, this method could detect l. monocytogenes in hot dog or bologna naturally contaminated or artificially inoculated with 10 to 1,000 cfu/g after enrichment in buffered listeria enrichment broth.

AB  == in klebsiella aerogenes, the gdha gene codes for glutamate dehydrogenase, one of  the enzymes responsible for assimilating ammonia into glutamate. expression of a  gdhap-lacz transcriptional fusion was strongly repressed by the nitrogen assimilation control protein, nac. this strong repression (>50-fold under conditions of severe nitrogen limitation) required the presence of two separate nac binding sites centered at -89 and +57 relative to the start of gdha transcription. mutants lacking either or both of these sites lost the strong repression. the distance between the two sites was less important than the face of the helix on which they lay. insertion or deletion of 10 bp between the sites  had little effect on the strong repression, but insertion of 5 bp or deletion of  either 5 or 15 bp decreased the repression significantly. we propose that the strong repression of gdhap-lacz expression requires an interaction between the nac molecules bound at the two sites. a weaker repression of gdhap-lacz expression (about threefold) required only the nac site centered at -89. this weaker repression appears to result from nac's ability to prevent the action of a positive effector the target of which overlaps the nac binding site centered at -89. point mutations and deletions of this region result in the same threefold reduction in gdhap-lacz expression as the presence of nac at this site.

TI  == cloning and characterisation of male in burkholderia pseudomallei.
AB  == no recombinant protein is available for serodiagnosis or skin test in the diagnosis of melioidosis. this report describes the cloning of the male gene, which encodes an immunogenic protein of burkholderia pseudomallei. bi-directional dna sequencing of male revealed that the gene contained a single open reading frame encoding 416 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 44.4 kda. blast analysis showed that the putative protein encoded by male is homologous to the maltose-binding protein (mbp) of other bacteria. it has 48% and 63% amino acid identity and similarity with the mbp of brucella abortus, and male complementation assay showed that it partially complemented the function of the mbp of escherichia coli. several highly conserved regions among the mbp of b. pseudomallei, br. abortus, salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium, e. coli and  enterobacter aerogenes were observed. these regions represent signatures a, b, c, d and f identified in the mbp of e. coli. further sequence analysis revealed that the first 24 amino acid residues of the mbp of b. pseudomallei probably represent the n-terminal signal peptide of the protein. similar to the signal peptide of the mbp of e. coli, ent. aerogenes and s. typhimurium, the mbp of b. pseudomallei contains two basic residues in the first eight amino acids, followed by a hydrophobic core, with the last three amino acids in the signal peptide being ala-gln-ala, conforming to the consensus sequence ala-x-ala at positions -3 to -1 relative to the site of proteolytic cleavage for recognition by signal peptidase  i. further studies on serodiagnosis of melioidosis with recombinant mbp should be performed.

TI  == molecular characterization of global regulatory rna species that control pathogenicity factors in erwinia amylovora and erwinia herbicola pv. gypsophilae.
AB  == rsmb(ecc) specifies a nontranslatable rna regulator that controls exoprotein production and pathogenicity in soft rot-causing erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora. this effect of rsmb(ecc) rna is mediated mostly by neutralizing the function of rsma(ecc), an rna-binding protein of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora, which acts as a global negative regulator. to determine the occurrence of functional homologs of rsmb(ecc) in non-soft-rot-causing erwinia species, we cloned the rsmb genes of e. amylovora (rsmb(ea)) and e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae (rsmb(ehg)). we show that rsmb(ea) in e. amylovora positively regulates extracellular polysaccharide (eps) production, motility, and pathogenicity. in e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae, rsmb(ehg) elevates the levels of transcripts of a cytokinin (etz) gene and stimulates the production of eps and yellow pigment as well as motility. rsma(ea) and rsma(ehg) have more than 93% identity to rsma(ecc) and, like the latter, function as negative regulators by affecting the transcript stability of the target gene. the rsmb genes reverse the negative effects of rsma(ea), rsma(ehg), and rsma(ecc), but the extent of reversal is highest with homologous combinations of rsm genes. these observations and findings that rsmb(ea) and rsmb(ehg) rna bind rsma(ecc) indicate that the rsmb effect is channeled via rsma. additional support for this conclusion comes from the observation that the rsmb genes are much more effective as positive regulators in a rsma(+) strain of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora than in its rsma(-) derivative. e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae produces a 290-base rsmb transcript that is not subject to processing. by contrast, e. amylovora produces 430- and 300-base rsmb transcripts, the latter presumably derived by processing of the primary transcript as previously noted with the transcripts of rsmb(ecc). southern blot hybridizations revealed the presence of rsmb homologs in e. carotovora, e. chrysanthemi, e. amylovora, e. herbicola, e. stewartii and e. rhapontici, as well as in other enterobacteria such as escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, serratia marcescens, shigella flexneri,  enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, yersinia enterocolitica, and y. pseudotuberculosis. a comparison of rsmb sequences from several of these enterobacterial species revealed a highly conserved 34-mer region which is predicted to play a role in positive regulation by rsmb rna.

TI  == methionine-to-cysteine recycling in klebsiella aerogenes.
AB  == in the enteric bacteria escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, sulfate is reduced to sulfide and assimilated into the amino acid cysteine; in turn, cysteine provides the sulfur atom for other sulfur-bearing molecules in the cell, including methionine. these organisms cannot use methionine as a sole source of sulfur. here we report that this constraint is not shared by many other enteric bacteria, which can use either cysteine or methionine as the sole source of sulfur. the enteric bacterium klebsiella aerogenes appears to use at least two pathways to allow the reduced sulfur of methionine to be recycled into cysteine.  in addition, the ability to recycle methionine on solid media, where cys mutants  cannot use methionine as a sulfur source, appears to be different from that in liquid media, where they can. one pathway likely uses a cystathionine intermediate to convert homocysteine to cysteine and is induced under conditions  of sulfur starvation, which is likely sensed by low levels of the sulfate reduction intermediate adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate. the cysb regulatory proteins  appear to control activation of this pathway. a second pathway may use a methanesulfonate intermediate to convert methionine-derived methanethiol to sulfite. while the transsulfurylation pathway may be directed to recovery of methionine, the methanethiol pathway likely represents a general salvage mechanism for recovery of alkane sulfide and alkane sulfonates. therefore, the relatively distinct biosyntheses of cysteine and methionine in e. coli and salmonella appear to be more intertwined in klebsiella.

TI  == alternative pathways for siroheme synthesis in klebsiella aerogenes.
AB  == siroheme, the cofactor for sulfite and nitrite reductases, is formed by methylation, oxidation, and iron insertion into the tetrapyrrole uroporphyrinogen iii (uro-iii). the cysg protein performs all three steps of siroheme biosynthesis in the enteric bacteria escherichia coli and salmonella enterica. in either taxon, cysg mutants cannot reduce sulfite to sulfide and require a source of sulfide or cysteine for growth. in addition, cysg-mediated methylation of uro-iii is required for de novo synthesis of cobalamin (coenzyme b(12)) in s. enterica. we have determined that cysg mutants of the related enteric bacterium klebsiella  aerogenes have no defect in the reduction of sulfite to sulfide. these data suggest that an alternative enzyme allows for siroheme biosynthesis in cysg-deficient strains of klebsiella. however, klebsiella cysg mutants fail to synthesize coenzyme b(12), suggesting that the alternative siroheme biosynthetic  pathway proceeds by a different route. gene cysf, encoding an alternative siroheme synthase homologous to cysg, has been identified by genetic analysis and lies within the cysfdnc operon; the cysf gene is absent from the e. coli and s. enterica genomes. while cysg is coregulated with the siroheme-dependent nitrite reductase, the cysf gene is regulated by sulfur starvation. models for alternative regulation of the cysf and cysg siroheme synthases in klebsiella and  for the loss of the cysf gene from the ancestor of e. coli and s. enterica are presented.

TI  == the nucleoside-specific tsx channel from the outer membrane of salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes: functional characterization and dna sequence analysis of the tsx genes.
AB  == the escherichia coli tsx gene encodes an integral outer-membrane protein (tsx) that functions as a substrate-specific channel for deoxynucleosides and the antibiotic albicidin, and also serves as a receptor for bacteriophages and colicins. we cloned the structural genes of the tsx proteins from salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes and expressed them  in an e.coli tsx mutant. the heterologous tsx proteins fully substituted the e.coli tsx protein with respect to its function in deoxynucleoside and albicidin  uptake, and as receptor for colicin k. the tsx proteins from k. pneumoniae and ent. aerogenes were also proficient as receptors for several tsx-specific bacteriophages, whereas the corresponding protein from s. typhimurium did not confer sensitivity against these phages. the nucleotide sequence of the tsx genes from s. typhimurium, k. pneumoniae and ent. aerogenes was established. each of the tsx proteins is initially synthesized with typical bacterial signal sequence  peptides and the predicted mature forms of the tsx proteins have a calculated m(r) of 30,567 (265 residues), 31,412 (272 residues) and 31,477 (272 residues), respectively. multiple sequence alignments between the tsx proteins showed a high degree of sequence identity and revealed the presence of four hypervariable regions, which are thought to constitute segments of the polypeptide chain exposed at the cell surface. most notable was a deletion of 8 amino acids in one  of these hypervariable domains in the s. typhimurium tsx protein. when this deletion was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into the corresponding region of the e.coli tsx gene, the mutant tsx-515 protein lost its phage receptor function but still served as a colicin k receptor and as a substrate-specific channel, indicating that the region between residues 198 and 207 might be part of the bacteriophage receptor area. multiple sequence alignments, structural predictions and the properties of previously characterized tsx missense mutants were taken into account to develop a two-dimensional model for the topological organization of the tsx protein within the outer membrane.

TI  == evidence suggesting cis action by the tnac leader peptide in regulating transcription attenuation in the tryptophanase operon of escherichia coli.
AB  == expression of the tryptophanase (tna) operon in escherichia coli is regulated by  catabolite repression and transcription attenuation. elevated levels of tryptophan induce transcription antitermination at one or more rho factor-dependent termination sites in the leader region of the operon. induction  requires translation of a 24-residue coding region, tnac, located in the 319-nucleotide transcribed leader region preceding tnaa, the structural gene for  tryptophanase. in the present paper, we show that two bacterial species that lack tryptophanase activity, enterobacter aerogenes and salmonella typhimurium, allow  tryptophanase induction and tna operon regulation when they carry a plasmid containing the e. coli tna operon. the role of tnac in induction was examined by  introducing mutations in a 24-nucleotide segment of tnac of e. coli surrounding and including the crucial trp codon 12. some mutations resulted in a noninducible phenotype; these mostly introduced nonconservative amino acid substitutions in tnac. other mutations had little or no effect; these generally were in third positions of codons or introduced conservative amino acid replacements. a tryptophan-inserting, uga-reading glutamine suppressor trna was observed to restore partial regulation when trp codon 12 of tnac was changed to uga. stop codons introduced downstream of trp codon 12 in all three reading frames established that induction requires translation in the natural tnac reading frame. our findings suggest that the tnac leader peptide acts in cis to prevent rho-dependent termination.

TI  == molecular cloning, mapping, and regulation of pho regulon genes for phosphonate breakdown by the phosphonatase pathway of salmonella typhimurium lt2.
AB  == two pathways exist for cleavage of the carbon-phosphorus (c-p) bond of phosphonates, the c-p lyase and the phosphonatase pathways. it was previously demonstrated that escherichia coli carries genes (named phn) only for the c-p lyase pathway and that enterobacter aerogenes carries genes for both pathways (k.-s. lee, w. w. metcalf, and b. l. wanner, j. bacteriol. 174:2501-2510, 1992).  in contrast, here it is shown that salmonella typhimurium lt2 carries genes only  for the phosphonatase pathway. genes for the s. typhimurium phosphonatase pathway were cloned by complementation of e. coli delta phn mutants. genes for these pathways were proven not to be homologous and to lie in different chromosomal regions. the s. typhimurium phn locus lies near 10 min; the e. coli phn locus lies near 93 min. the s. typhimurium phn gene cluster is about 7.2 kb in length and, on the basis of gene fusion analysis, appears to consist of two (or more) genes or operons that are divergently transcribed. like that of the e. coli phn locus, the expression of the s. typhimurium phn locus is activated under conditions of pi limitation and is subject to pho regulon control. this was shown both by complementation of the appropriate e. coli mutants and by the construction of s. typhimurium mutants with lesions in the phob and pst loci, which are required for activation and inhibition of pho regulon gene expression,  respectively. complementation studies indicate that the s. typhimurium phn locus  probably includes genes both for phosphonate transport and for catalysis of c-p bond cleavage.

TI  == the amino acid sequence of lrp is highly conserved in four enteric microorganisms.
AB  == lrp (leucine-responsive regulatory protein) is a global regulator of metabolism in escherichia coli (j. m. calvo and r. g. matthews, microbiol. rev. 58:466-490,  1994). the lrp genes from three other enteric microorganisms, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella aerogenes, and salmonella typhimurium, were cloned and sequenced. an analysis of these sequences and of the previously determined sequence from e. coli indicated that the vast majority of changes were synonymous rather than nonsynonymous changes. nucleotide changes occurred at 89 of 492 positions but resulted in amino acid changes at only 2 of 164 positions. this analysis suggests that the lrp amino acid sequence is highly adapted for function and that almost all amino acid changes lead to a protein that functions less well than the wild-type protein.

TI  == the tryptophan repressor sequence is highly conserved among the enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == tryptophan biosynthesis in escherichia coli is regulated by the product of the trpr gene, the tryptophan (trp) repressor. trp aporepressor binds the corepressor, l-tryptophan, to form a holorepressor complex, which binds trp operator dna tightly, and inhibits transcription of the tryptophan biosynthetic operon. the conservation of trp operator sequences among enteric gram-negative bacteria suggests that trpr genes from other bacterial species can be cloned by complementation in e. coli. to clone trpr homologues, a deletion of the e. coli trpr gene, delta trpr504, was made on a plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis, then crossed onto the e. coli genome. plasmid clones of the trpr genes of enterobacter aerogenes and enterobacter cloacae were isolated by complementation  of the delta trpr504 allele, scored as the ability to repress beta-galactosidase  synthesis from a prophage-borne trpe-lacz gene fusion. the predicted amino acid sequences of four enteric trpr proteins show differences, clustered on the backside of the folded repressor, opposite the dna-binding helix-turn-helix substructures. these differences are predicted to have little effect on the interactions of the aporepressor with tryptophan, holorepressor with operator dna, or tandemly bound holorepressor dimers with one another. although there is some variation observed at the dimer interface, interactions predicted to stabilize the interface are conserved. the phylogenetic relationships revealed by the trpr amino acid sequence alignment agree with the results of others.

AB  == a protein carboxyl methyltransferase (ec 2.1.1.77) that recognizes age-damaged proteins for potential repair or degradation reactions has been found in all vertebrate tissues and cells examined to date. this enzyme catalyzes the transfer of methyl groups from s-adenosylmethionine to the carboxyl groups of d-aspartyl or l-isoaspartyl residues that are formed spontaneously from normal l-aspartyl and l-asparaginyl residues. a similar methyltransferase has been found in two bacterial species, escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium, suggesting that this enzyme performs an essential function in all cells. in this study, we show that this enzyme is present in cytosolic extracts of six additional members of the alpha and gamma subdivisions of the purple bacteria: pseudomonas aeruginosa (gamma), rhodobacter sphaeroides (alpha), and the gamma enteric species klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, and serratia marcescens. dna probes from the e. coli methyltransferase gene hybridized only to the chromosomal dna of the enteric species. interestingly, no activity was found  in the plant pathogen erwinia chrysanthemi, a member of the enteric family, nor in rhizobium meliloti or rhodopseudomonas palustris, two members of the alpha subdivision. additionally, we could not detect activity in the four gram-positive species bacillus subtilis, b. stearothermophilus, lactobacillus casei, and streptomyces griseus. the absence of enzyme activity was not due to the presence  of inhibitors in the extracts. these results suggest that many cells may not have the enzymatic machinery to recognize abnormal aspartyl residues by methylation reactions. since the nonenzymatic degradation reactions that generate these residues occur in all cells, other pathways may be present in nature to ensure that these types of altered proteins do not accumulate and interfere with normal  cellular physiology.

AB  == as few as five of the species of bacteria commonly found in human faeces--escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides ovatus and fusobacterium varium--when grown together in anaerobic continuous flow cultures exerted antagonistic effects on salmonella typhimurium as great as those given by mixed bacteria from extracts of human faeces. in a single culture, the population of s. typhimurium was c. 10(8) cfu/ml but in mixed cultures with the five antagonistic bacteria or mixed faecal bacteria it was reduced to c. 10(3) cfu/ml. antagonism appeared to be the result of competition for the growth limiting amino acids, arginine, serine, threonine and aspartic acid. optimal manifestation of antagonism required the presence of carbon sources fermentable only by antagonistic bacteria, such as lactose 0.1%, w/v, sucrose 0.1% (w/v) and starch 0.2-0.3% w/v. these carbohydrates promoted the growth of the antagonistic bacteria, particularly e. coli and b. ovatus. however, an increase in concentration by several fold of any one of four growth-limiting amino acids in the medium diminished the antagonistic effects and the population  of s. typhimurium rose 10(2)-10(3)-fold.

TI  == interspecies compatibility of selenoprotein biosynthesis in enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == several species of enterobacteriaceae were investigated for their ability to synthesize selenium-containing macromolecules. seleniated trna species as well as seleniated polypeptides were formed by all organisms tested. two selenopolypeptides could be identified in most of the organisms which correspond  to the 80 kda and 110 kda subunits of the anaerobically induced formate dehydrogenase isoenzymes of e. coli. in those organisms possessing both isoenzymes, their synthesis was induced in a mutually exclusive manner dependent  upon whether nitrate was present during anaerobic growth. the similarity of the 80 kda selenopolypeptide among the different species was assessed by immunological and genetic analyses. antibodies raised against the 80 kda selenopolypeptide from e. coli cross-reacted with an 80 kda polypeptide in those  organisms which exhibited fermentative formate dehydrogenase activity. these organisms also contained genes which hybridised with the fdhf gene from e. coli.  in an attempt to identify the signals responsible for incorporation of selenium into the selenopolypeptides in these organisms we cloned a portion of the fdhf gene homologue from enterobacter aerogenes. the nucleotide sequence of the cloned 723 bp fragment was determined and it was shown to contain an in-frame tga (stop) codon at the position corresponding to that present in the e. coli gene. this fragment was able to direct incorporation of selenocysteine when expressed in the heterologous host, e. coli. moreover, the e. coli fdhf gene was expressed in salmonella typhimurium, serratia marcescens and proteus mirabilis, indicating a high degree of conservation of the seleniating system throughout the enterobacteria.

AB  == the lexa-regulated sula (sfia) gene of escherichia coli encodes an unstable protein which inhibits cell division. by determining the nucleotide sequences of  the corresponding genes from the related bacteria salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter aerogenes and serratia marcescens it was found that the regulatory region and the lexa binding site (sos box) have been better conserved during evolution than the coding sequence. the n terminus of the sula protein [amino acid (aa) residues 1-30] has diverged extensively during the evolution of enterobacteriaceae, whereas the central region (aa residues 31-149) has been well conserved. at the c terminus a sequence showing some homology to the n protein of phage lambda was detected that may represent a recognition site for the lon protease, which is known to degrade both polypeptides. when expressed in e. coli, the foreign sula genes did not block cell division suggesting that their products are inactive. this may indicate that the n terminus of the sula protein is involved in recognizing the cell division apparatus.

TI  == growth of salmonellas in different enrichment media.
AB  == the usefulness of selenite-f (s-f), tetrathionate (mkt) and rappaport-10 (r-10) broths as enrichment media to support growth of salmonellas either alone or in the presence of other competing organisms was studied. their ability to support the growth of stressed salmonellas from water was also investigated. it was observed that r-10 was more inhibitory to competing organisms than mkt and s-f. it strongly inhibited the growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter freundii  and proteus vulgaris though not of escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes. it was more toxic, however, to small numbers of salmonellas than mkt and s-f. tetrathionate was strongly inhibitory for e. coli and ent. aerogenes but much less so for proteus and pseudomonas species. selenite-f was much less inhibitory  than mkt to ps. aeruginosa and it did not inhibit growth of e. coli and ent. aerogenes as much as mkt. salmonellas were inhibited by all three enrichment media and none of them is ideally suited for direct use. of the three media, r-10 was much more inhibitory to stressed organisms than s-f or mkt.

TI  == interspecific reconstitution of maltose transport and chemotaxis in escherichia coli with maltose-binding protein from various enteric bacteria.
AB  == in escherichia coli, the periplasmic maltose-binding protein (mbp), the product of the male gene, is the primary recognition component of the transport system for maltose and maltodextrins. it is also the maltose chemoreceptor, in which capacity it interacts with the signal transducer tar (taxis to aspartate and some repellents). in studies of the maltose system in other members of the family enterobacteriaceae, we found that mbp is produced by salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and serratia marcescens. mbp from  all of these species cross-reacted with antibody against the e. coli protein and  had a similar molecular weight (about 40,000). the shigella flexneri and proteus  mirabilis strains we examined did not synthesize mbp. the isoelectric points of mbp from different species varied from the acid extreme of e. coli (4.8) to the basic extreme of e. aerogenes (8.9). all species with mbp transported maltose with high affinity, although the vmax for k. pneumoniae was severalfold lower than that for the other species. maltose chemotaxis was observed only in e. coli  and e. aerogenes. in s. typhimurium lt2, tar was completely inactive in maltose taxis, although it signaled normally in response to aspartate. mbp isolated from  all five species could be used to reconstitute maltose transport and taxis in a delta male strain of e. coli after permeabilization of the outer membrane with calcium.

TI  == [transfer of kanamycin resistance among familial strains of enterobacteriaceae isolated from a chronic bacterial carrier of salmonella schottmuelleri].
AB  == escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes and s. schottmuelleri were isolated from the large intestine of a bacteriocarrier. e. coli and e. aerogenes strains proved to be resistant to a number of antibiotics. plasmids were detected in dna preparations obtained from e. coli strains. after the hybridization of these e. coli strains with e. coli c600 5k and s. schottmuelleri at 28 degrees c the transfer of resistance to kanamycin was found to occur. from some of the transconjugates thus obtained resistance to kanamycin was transferred to e. aerogenes. this resistance was found to be controlled by the plasmid with a molecular weight exceeding 2 md. the fact that s. schottmuelleri in the carrier's body retained their sensitivity to antibiotics can be explained by the absence of the transfer of plasmid kmr at a temperature exceeding 28 degrees c and by the existence of the infective agent in an ecological niche other than that of e. coli.

AB  == experiments on isogenic strains of different enterobacterial species, both carrying hemolytic plasmids and free from them, have demonstrated that their "killing" effect on mice is linked with the yield of hemolysin and does not depend on the origin of hly plasmids or the chemotype of bacteria. plasmid p ie 567 coding the synthesis of alpha-hemolysin has been shown to be capable of expression in enterobacter aerogenes, hafnia alvei and salmonella typhimurium strains, but e. aerogenes 3/43, h. alvei alpha 773 and escherichia coli j53 carrying p ie 567, in contrast to e. coli p 678 and s. typhimurium 415 carrying the same plasmid, produce less alpha-hemolysin and have no pronounced effect in reducing the survival time of intranasally infected mice.

AB  == in the presence of luminol, resident as well as thioglycolate-induced and immunized macrophages emitted chemiluminescence more efficiently when the cells were exposed to living salmonella typhimurium than when they were exposed to the  same bacterium killed by ultraviolet light or heat. this phenomenon was observed  whether or not the bacterium was opsonized. the different response to living and  killed bacteria was also found with escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus morganii, and enterobacter aerogenes, but not with shigella sonnei, klebsiella pneumoniae, and propionibacterium acnes. the results suggest that macrophages respond better to living, motile bacteria than to nonmotile or killed bacteria. the experimental results obtained with motility mutants of s. typhimurium, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa confirm that macrophages exposed to the motile bacteria emit chemiluminescence more efficiently and ingest the motile bacteria at a much faster rate than the nonmotile bacteria.

TI  == intracellular distribution of enzymes of phospholipid metabolism in several gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == cell-free extracts of salmonella typhimurium, serratia marcescens, enterobacter aerogenes, and micrococcus cerificans contained the following enzymatic activities related to phospholipid metabolism: cytidine 5'-diphospho-1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol (cdp-diglyceride):l-serine o-phosphatidyltransferase (phosphatidylserine synthase), phosphatidylserine decarboxylase, cdp-diglyceride:sn-glycero-3-phosphate phosphatidyltransferase (phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase), phosphatidylglycerophosphate phosphatase, and cdp-diglyceride hydrolase. the intracellular distribution of these enzymatic activities as determined by sucrose density gradient centrifugation of cell-free extracts was shown to be similar in each species investigated. the phosphatidylserine decarboxylase, phosphatidylglycerophosphate  synthase, and cdp-diglyceride hydrolase activities were all associated with the cell envelope fraction, whereas the phosphatidylserine synthase activity was associated mainly with the ribosomal fraction. these enzymatic activities are comparable and have an intracellular distribution similar to those found in escherichia coli cell-free extracts. therefore, the pathways established for phospholipid biosynthesis in e. coli can also account for the synthesis of the major phospholipids (phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol) in several other gram-negative organisms. in addition, the unusual ribosomal association of the phosphatidylserine synthase from e. coli (raetz and kennedy, j. biol. chem. 247:2008-2014, 1972) appears to be a general property for this activity in several other bacterial species.

TI  == immunochemical comparison of phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase-indoleglycerol  phosphate synthetase among the enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == the bifunctional enzyme of the tryptophan operon, phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase-indoleglycerol phosphate synthetase (prai-ingps;ec 4.1.1.48), was characterized by an immunochemical study of six representative members of the enterobacteriaceae: escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, erwinia carotovora, and proteus vulgaris. prai-ingps was purified from e. coli, and antisera were prepared in rabbits. these antisera were utilized in quantitative microcomplement fixation allowing for a comparison of the overall antigenic surface structure of the various homologous enzymes. these data showed e. coli prai-ingps and s. marcescens and e. carotovora prai-ingps (taken as a group) to have an index of dissimilarity of approximately 10, whereas the other organisms had values intermediate. in addition, antiserum to e. coli tryptophan synthetase beta2 subunit was used in microcomplement fixation to extend the previous comparison of this subunit (rocha, crawford, and mills, 1972) to e. carotovora and p. vulgaris. indexes of dissimilarity for e. coli compared to p. vulgaris of e. carotovora were 1.0 and 1.7, respectively. agar immunodiffusion using prai-ingps antisera showed significant cross-reaction among e. coli, e. aerogenes, s. typhimurium, and p. vulgaris whereas the enzymes from s. marcescens and e. carotovora cross-reacted to a lesser extent, with the latter reaction being quite weak. comparative enzyme neutralization using e. coli prai-ingps antisera showed significant cross-reactions among the enzymes in that all were neutralized at least 25%. the  data taken together indicate that the trpc gene products in the enterobacteriaceae are a homologous group of proteins, that the genetic divergene of the trpc gene is basically the same as the trpa gene, and that both are less conserved than the trpb gene. furthermore, the prai-ingps, enzyme active site appears to represent a more evolutionarily conserved region of the protein. these findings indicate that, with respect to prai-ingps, similarity to e. coli among the organisms examined is in the following order: (e. aerogenes, s. typhimurium,  p. vulgaris) greater than (s. marcescens, e. carotovora).

TI  == reversible inactivation of the isocitrate dehydrogenase of escherichia coli ml308 during growth on acetate.
AB  == during aerobic growth of escherichia coli ml308 on acetate as sole carbon source, the apparent synthesis of isocitrate dehydrogenase was repressed relative to cultures on other carbon sources, such as glucose, which do not employ the glyoxylate bypass as an anaplerotic sequence. when cells were removed from an acetate medium, or when compounds were added which made the operation of the glyoxylate bypass unnecessary, the activity of isocitrate dehydrogenase rapidly increased 3- to 4-fold but fell again on restoration to an acetate medium. changes in activity were rapid and, furthermore, could be demonstrated in the absence of protein synthesis. it is thus improbable that the mechanism involved degradation or de novo synthesis of the enzyme protein. oxaloacetate and glyoxylate showed concerted inhibition of isocitrate dehydrogenase which could be relieved by dialysis. because extracts of low enzyme activity, derived from acetate-metabolizing cells, could not be stimulated by dialysis or by addition of a wide range of metabolites, it is unlikely that low molecular weight, freely dissociable effectors were responsible for stimulation or inhibition of activity. control of isocitrate dehydrogenase permitted the efficient utilization of acetate as sole source of carbon and energy but perserved the capacity of the cell to respond rapidly to an improvement in nutritional conditions. a limited survey showed that the mechanism is common but not universal among strains of e.  coli and occurs in at least one strain each of klebsiella aerogenes, salmonella typhimurium and serratia marcescens.

(i) alphabeta association constants for the various beta(2) subunits and e. coli alpha subunit varied between 3.6 x 10(8)m(-1) for e. coli and 0.33 x 10(8)m(-1) for s. marcescens; values for the other organisms were intermediate. (ii) antiserum neutralization of the beta(2) subunit enzyme activity using anti-e. coli beta(2) serum showed significant cross-reaction among the organisms (e. coli, 1.0; s. dysenteriae, 0.98; s. typhimurium, 0.67; e. aerogenes, 0.61; s. marcescens, 0.42). (iii) quantitative microcomplement fixation showed e. coli beta(2) and s. marcescens beta(2) subunits to have an index of dissimilarity of 1.8 while the other organisms had intermediate indexes. similar complement fixation data were obtained with antisera from separate rabbits and from first course and boost sera. these findings suggest that the general surface structure  and the respective alpha subunit binding site of the beta(2) subunits from these  enterobacteriaceae have been strongly conserved.

(an initial examination of the blue-green alga anabaena variabilis indicates nonaggregation in this species also.) this situation in bacteria is in marked contrast to that found in neurospora crassa and other fungi in which the same five enzymes are associated as an aggregate encoded (at least in the case of n. crassa) by a cluster of five genes. in addition, also in contrast to n. crassa, no evidence was obtained for more than one kind of dehydroquinase activity in any of the bacteria examined. these comparative results are discussed in relation to  the origin, evolution, and functional significance of the gene-enzyme relationships existing in the early steps of aromatic biosynthesis in bacteria and fungi.

AB  == supplementing the salts-glucose medium of escherichia coli with adenine initiates induction of adenosine deaminase (adenosine aminohydrolase, ec 3.5.4.4), growth inhibition, and an increased potential for the net deamination of adenine. the extent and duration of these events are proportional to the initial adenine concentration and are dependent upon adenylate pyrophosphorylase and repression of histidine biosynthesis for maximal expression. the conversion of adenine to hypoxanthine, though limited in rate, occurs concurrently with induction and accounts for the progressively decreasing rate of deaminase induction, since hypoxanthine is a relatively ineffective inducer. the subsequent decrease in deaminase activity is due to dilution by continued cell division and by enzyme inactivation which occurs during the late-log and early-stationary phases. the partially purified deaminase is labile to a number of environmental conditions, particularly to phosphate buffers of ph 6.8 or less. a disproportionately slow rate of adenine deamination by cells utilizing lactate permits a more prolonged period of induction and, consequently, a greater quantity of enzyme to be synthesized; cell division, but not enzyme inactivation, reduces enzyme concentration. the adenosine deaminases of aerobacter aerogenes and salmonella typhimurium are not inducible.

TI  == rapid and sensitive detection of bacteria by gas chromatography.
AB  == a gas chromatograph fitted with electron capture and flame ionization detectors was employed for the rapid detection of bacteria by analysis for their metabolic  products. the presence of proteus vulgaris, streptococcus faecalis, s. liquefaciens, escherichia coli b, bacillus cereus, and b. popilliae was detected  in 2 to 4 hr in media inoculated with less than 10(4) cells per ml, whereas a 7-  to 12-hr growth period was required for the detection of products formed in cultures of serratia marcescens, aerobacter aerogenes, e. coli k-12, staphylococcus aureus, and salmonella typhimurium. metabolites elaborated by the  equivalent of less than a single cell of b. cereus, s. faecalis, p. vulgaris, or  e. coli b were sensed by the electron capture detector. the flame ionization detector was generally not as sensitive. volatile metabolites were identified, and their concentrations were determined.

AB  == yotis, william (loyola university, hines, ill.), and ronald stanke. bacteriostatic action of progesterone on staphylococci and other microorganisms.  j. bacteriol. 92:1285-1289. 1966.-progesterone has been examined in vitro for antibacterial activity against 10 microorganisms. turbidimetric and manometric techniques were used to assay the antibacterial activity of progesterone. the organisms tested consisted of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, gaffkya tetragena, bacillus subtilis, listeria monocytogenes, candida albicans, escherichia coli, aerobacter aerogenes, salmonella paratyphi, and proteus vulgaris. antibacterial action was shown by progesterone only against the gram-positive microorganisms when they were grown in tryptic soy broth containing 10 to 20 mug of progesterone per ml. pregnenolone, 4-pregnen-20beta-ol-3-one, and 5alpha-pregnane also possessed antistaphylococcal properties, whereas pregnanolone, pregnandione, 11alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, and 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone did not. the bacteriostatic action of progesterone on staphylococci was exerted primarily during the first 8 hr of incubation, and it was reduced in the presence of oxygen. in the presence of 20 mug of progesterone  per ml, there was significant reduction in the oxidation by resting staphylococcal suspensions or utilization by staphylococci of pyruvate as an energy source during growth.

(stanford university, stanford), d. r. helinski, r. l. somerville, and c. yanofsky. comparison of the tryptophan synthetase alpha subunits of several species of enterobacteriaceae. j. bacteriol. 91:1819-1826. 1966.-the tryptophan synthetase alpha subunits of escherichia coli k-12, e. coli  b, shigella dysenteriae, salmonella typhimurium, and aerobacter aerogenes have been purified and their structures compared. each of these alpha subunits exhibits a sedimentation coefficient of about 2.7s. peptide patterns of trypsin plus chymotrypsin digests of the alpha subunits have indicated that all of the alpha subunits have peptide regions in common. the patterns of e. coli k-12, e. coli b, and s. dysenteriae alpha subunits appear to be nearly identical, whereas  the alpha subunits from s. typhimurium and a. aerogenes differ from those of e. coli and from each other. it has also been shown that the e. coli structural gene for the alpha subunit is translated identically in e. coli and s. typhimurium.

TI  == the bacterial induction of homograft sensitivity. ii. effects of sensitization with staphylococci and other microoorganisms.
AB  == heat-killed strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus albus can induce  in guinea pigs a state of altered reactivity to skin homografts which is indistinguishable from that which results from sensitization with homologous tissues or group a streptococci. challenge of suitably prepared recipients with first-set skin homografts obtained from unrelated randomly selected donors elicits white graft reactions or accelerated rejection of such grafts. other bacteria tested included lancefield streptococcal groups b, c, d, e, g, h, l, and o, pneumococcus types ii, iii, xiv and a rough strain, corynebacterium xerosis, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, aerobacter aerogenes, salmonella typhimurium, proteus vulgaris, neisseria catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, and two human virulent strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis. none of these microorganisms was active in the induction of homograft sensitivity in the guinea pig. pretreatment of recipients with gram-negative bacterial suspensions was associated with a slight increase in the mean survival time of first-set skin homografts. results of this study suggest the presence in staphylococci, as well  as in group a streptococci, of antigens related in their biologic effects to tissue transplantation antigens.

TI  == effect of naturally occurring xanthines on bacteria. i. antimicrobial action and  potentiating effect on antibiotic spectra.
AB  == the effect of xanthines on various microorganisms was studied. the antibacterial  effect was not high; most of the test organisms could easily withstand a concentration of 2,500 mug/ml. caffeine was more antibacterial than theophylline, and the latter more than theobromine. caffeine citrate exhibited greater inhibitory effect than did pure caffeine. the effect was both bacteriostatic and  bactericidal against susceptible organisms. the susceptibility of organisms to xanthines differed greatly even in related species. the morphology of aerobacter  aerogenes and a. cloacae was affected under the influence of caffeine; filamentation of cells followed sublethal doses. potentiation was seen with antibiotics and caffeine; resistant strains were killed with a lower dose of drug in the presence of caffeine. this potentiating effect was pronounced with the tetracyclines; with streptomycin, the effect was the contrary.

AB  == chang, te-wen (tufts university school of medicine, boston, mass.), and louis weinstein. morphological changes in gram-negative bacilli exposed to cephalothin. j. bacteriol. 88:1790-1797. 1964.-exposure of gram-negative bacteria to cephalothin (7-[thiophene-2-acetamido]-cephalosporanic acid) revealed the formation of long filaments and large bodies, which were capable of reverting to  normal cells when removed from contact with the drug. the degree of morphological change was found to be related to the concentration of antibiotic in which the organisms were suspended. the large bodies were altered by contact with solutions of varying osmolarity. different species showed variation in the ability to develop large bodies. a relationship between antibiotic sensitivity and the capacity to resist morphological alteration was observed. though most sensitive gram-negative bacilli were strikingly changed by exposure to cephalothin, naturally resistant ones were unaffected. organisms made drug-resistant in vitro  underwent changes in cellular form which were qualitatively the same but less intense than those which developed in parent strains originally sensitive to cephalothin.

TI  == effect of water extracts of carob pods, tannic acid, and their derivatives on the morphology and growth of microorganisms.
AB  == the effect of aqueous extracts of carob (ceratonia siliqua) pods, gallotannic acid, gallic acid, and catechol on several microorganisms was studied. carob pod  extract and tannic acid showed a strong antimicrobial activity toward some cellulolytic bacteria. on the basis of tannin content, to which antimicrobial effect was related, carob pod extracts inhibited cellvibrio fulvus and clostridium cellulosolvens at 15 mug/ml, sporocytophaga myxococcoides at 45 mug/ml, and bacillus subtilis at 75 mug/ml. the inhibiting concentrations for tannic acid were found to be 12, 10, 45, and 30 mug/ml, respectively. gallic acid and catechol were much less effective. tannic acid and the tannin fraction of carob extract exerted both bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects on c. fulvus.  respiration of c. fulvus in the presence of bactericidal concentrations of tannic acid or tannin fraction of carob extract was inhibited less than 30%. a partial formation of "protoplasts" by c. fulvus was obtained after 2 hr of incubation in  a growth medium to which 20% sucrose, 0.15% mgso(4).7h(2)o, and 10 to 50 mug/ml of tannic acid or 500mug/ml of penicillin, or both, had been added. tannic acid and the tannin fraction of carob extract protected c. fulvus from metabolic lysis in sucrose solution. although the growth of other microorganisms tested was only  slightly affected, the morphology of some of them was drastically changed in the  presence of subinhibitory concentrations of carob pod extracts of tannic acid. it is suggested that the site of action of tannins on sensitive microorganisms is primarily the cell envelope.
