TI  == dynamic alteration of the colonic microbiota in intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury.
AB  == background: intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (i/r) plays an important role in critical illnesses. gut flora participate in the pathogenesis of the injury. this study is aimed at unraveling colonic microbiota alteration pattern and identifying specific bacterial species that differ significantly as well as observing colonic epithelium change in the same injury model during the reperfusion time course. methodology/principal findings: denaturing gradient gel  electrophoresis (dgge) was used to monitor the colonic microbiota of control rats and experimental rats that underwent 0.5 hour ischemia and 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 72 hours following reperfusion respectively. the microbiota similarity, bacterial diversity and species that characterized the dysbiosis were estimated based on the dgge profiles using a combination of statistical approaches. the interested bacterial species in the gel were cut and sequenced and were subsequently quantified and confirmed with real-time pcr. meanwhile, the epithelial barrier was checked by microscopy and d-lactate analysis. colonic flora changed early and differed significantly at 6 hours after reperfusion and then started to recover.  the shifts were characterized by the increase of escherichia coli and prevotella  oralis, and lactobacilli proliferation together with epithelia healing. conclusion/significance: this study shows for the first time that intestinal ischemia-reperfusion results in colonic flora dysbiosis that follows epithelia damage, and identifies the bacterial species that contribute most.

TI  == selection for high-level resistance by chronic triclosan exposure is not universal.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the effect of triclosan exposure on the antimicrobial  susceptibilities of numerically important dental bacteria. methods: a gradient plate technique was used to expose fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, neisseria subflava, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces naeslundii,  prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar repeatedly to escalating, sublethal concentrations  of triclosan. escherichia coli atcc 8739 was included as an organism showing the  triclosan resistance development trait. mic values towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were determined before and after biocide exposure. results: n. subflava, pr. nigrescens po. gingivalis and e. coli were highly susceptible to triclosan (mic range 0.1-3.9 mg/l), whereas the lactobacillus and  s. mutans were less susceptible (mic range 15.6-20.8 mg/l). triclosan exposure resulted in a highly significant ( approximately 400-fold) reduction in triclosan susceptibility (p < 0.01) for the positive control e. coli, although its mics towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were not significantly altered. minor ( approximately two-fold) decreases in triclosan susceptibility (mic) occurred for pr. nigrescens and in s. sanguis and s. oralis (mbc). mean changes in susceptibilities (mic and mbc) of the oral species to chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline did not exceed two-fold, although chlorhexidine mbcs for s. sanguis were markedly, but transiently, increased. conclusions: these data fail to demonstrate biologically significant drug resistance in triclosan-exposed bacteria and suggest that markedly decreased triclosan susceptibility, although confirmed for e. coli, is not a universal phenomenon. other bacteria possibly possess more susceptible targets than fabi that are highly conserved, which may govern triclosan activity.

TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. a total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabillis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii), pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobactor baumannii, acinetobactor lwoffii, bacteroides fragilis  group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron),  and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lwoffii throughout 6 years. the mic90 of  czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however, the decrease in antibacterial activities of czop against b. cepacia, and h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == prevotella and porphyromonas infections in children.
AB  == from 1974 to 1994, 504 isolates of prevotella and porphyromonas spp. were obtained from 435 (21%) of 2033 specimens from 418 children. they included 160 (32%) pr. melaninogenica, 105 (21%) pr. intermedia, 84 (17%) p. asaccharolytica,  58 (12%) pr. orisbuccae, and 58 (12%) pr. oralis. most prevotella and porphyromonas spp. were isolated from abscesses (176), pulmonary infections (85), ear infections (82), wound infections (44), peritonitis (38), paronychia (15) and chronic sinusitis (14). predisposing conditions were noted in 111 (27%) of the cases; these included previous surgery in 41 (10%), foreign body in 36 (9%), neurological deficiencies in 29 (7%), immunodeficiency in 21 (5%), steroid therapy in 12 (4%), diabetes in 8 (2%) and malignancy in 7 (2%). prevotella and porphyromonas spp. were the only isolates in 14 (3%) patients, and mixed infection was encountered in 404 (97%). the micro-organisms most commonly isolated with prevotella and porphyromonas spp. were anaerobic cocci (393 isolates), fusobacterium spp. (108), bacteroides spp. (b. fragilis group) (95), escherichia coli (56) and other gram-negative anaerobic bacilli (52). most bacteroides spp. and e. coli were isolated from intra-abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections around the rectal area, whereas most fusobacterium spp. were isolated from oropharyngeal, pulmonary and head and neck  sites. beta-lactamase production was detected in 191 (38%) prevotella and porphyromonas isolates from all body sites. all patients received antimicrobial therapy, and surgical drainage was performed in 173 (41%) cases. four patients died from their infection. these data illustrate the spectrum and importance of prevotella and porphyromonas spp. in infections in children.

TI  == the gene encoding a prevotella loescheii lectin-like adhesin contains an interrupted sequence which causes a frameshift.
AB  == we cloned and sequenced the prevotella loescheii gene plaa, which encodes a lectin-like adhesin that mediates the coaggregation of p. loescheii 1295 with streptococcus oralis 34. a probe derived from the n-terminal amino acid sequence  of the purified adhesin was used to identify the plaa gene from a p. loescheii genomic library constructed in lambda gem-11. sequence analysis of plaa indicates that the initial translation product contains a 22-amino-acid leader. the reading frame of the plaa gene is interrupted after amino acid 28 of the mature protein by a taa termination codon. amplification of the p. loescheii genomic dna in the  region surrounding this codon by the polymerase chain reaction followed by dna sequencing of the cloned dna fragment established that this stop codon was not an experimental artifact. a frameshift beginning 29 bp downstream of the ochre terminator was required to access the only large open reading frame in the gene.  amino acid sequences of six purified peptides derived by limited proteolysis of adhesin with endoproteinase lys-c matched the downstream amino acid sequence derived by translation of the large open reading frame. the gene coding sequence  of 2.4 kb contains sufficient information for the synthesis of an 89-kda protein. a putative rho-independent terminator (delta g = -25.5 kcal/mol [ca. -107 kj/mol]) was detected 38 bp downstream from the plaa stop codon.

TI  == pathogenicity of encapsulated bacteroides melaninogenicus group, b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  == the pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the bacteroides melaninogenicus (bm) group and four clinical isolates of b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal abscesses. only 11 isolates of bm group and one b. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). when the other 23 isolates, however, were injected sc in combination with either klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus  aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. the bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. capsules also formed in bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of k. pneumoniae or encapsulated bacteroides sp. once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.
