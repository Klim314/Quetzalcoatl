community-based interference against integration of pseudomonas aeruginosa into human salivary microbial biofilm.
as part of the human gastrointestinal tract, the oral cavity represents a complex biological system and harbors diverse bacterial species. unlike the gut microbiota, which is often considered a health asset, studies of the oral commensal microbiota have been largely limited to their implication in oral conditions such as dental caries and periodontal disease. less emphasis has been given to their potential beneficial roles, especially the protective effects against oral colonization by foreign or pathogenic bacteria. in this study, we used salivary microbiota derived from healthy human subjects to investigate protective effects against colonization and integration of pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic bacterial pathogen, into developing or pre-formed salivary biofilms. when co-cultivated in saliva medium, p. aeruginosa persisted in the planktonic phase, but failed to integrate into the salivary microbial community during biofilm formation. furthermore, in saliva medium supplemented with sucrose, the oral microbiota inhibited the growth of p. aeruginosa by producing lactic acid. more interestingly, while pre-formed salivary biofilms were able to prevent p. aeruginosa colonization, the same biofilms recovered from mild chlorhexidine gluconate treatment displayed a shift in microbial composition and showed a drastic reduction in protection. our study indicates that normal oral communities with balanced microbial compositions could be important in effectively preventing the integration of foreign or pathogenic bacterial species, such as p. aeruginosa.
lactoferrampin: a novel antimicrobial peptide in the n1-domain of bovine lactoferrin.
the antimicrobial activity of bovine lactoferrin is attributed to lactoferricin,  situated in the n1-domain. based on common features of antimicrobial peptides, a second putative antimicrobial domain was identified in the n1-domain of lactoferrin, designated lactoferrampin. this novel peptide exhibited candidacidal activity, which was substantially higher than the activity of lactoferrin. furthermore, lactoferrampin was active against bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but not against the fermenting bacteria actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis. notably, lactoferrampin is located in the n1-domain in close proximity to lactoferricin, which plays a crucial role in membrane-mediated activities of lactoferrin.
bacteriologic evaluation of the effect of nd:yag laser irradiation in experimental infected root canals.
the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the pumped diodium-nd:yag laser in sterilizing contaminated root canals. after hand instrumentation, 30 teeth were inoculated with actinomyces naeslundii ch-12 and 30 teeth with pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 and incubated for 24 h. the teeth were divided into three subgroups: subgroup a received no treatment; subgroup b was irradiated with laser (5 hz for 15 s or 10 hz for 15 s); and subgroup c was irrigated with 5.25% naocl. the number of viable bacteria in each group was evaluated by using the surface-spread plate technique. the results indicated an average of 34.0% decrease in colony-forming units for a. naeslundii ch-12 and 15.7% for p. aeruginosa atcc 27853 with the 5 hz/15 s laser treatment, and for the 10 hz laser frequency, a decrease of the 77.4% for a. naeslundii ch-12 and 85.8% for p. aeruginosa atcc 27853. no bacteria were detected in the canals treated with 5.25% naocl. the results show an antibacterial effect of the pumped diodium nd:yag laser, depending on the radiation frequency. however, 5.25% naocl was more effective than either laser application.
