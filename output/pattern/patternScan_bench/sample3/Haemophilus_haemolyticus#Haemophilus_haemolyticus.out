copper-zinc superoxide dismutase in haemophilus species.
copper-zinc superoxide dismutases ([cu,zn]-sods) are ubiquitous in eukaryotes but have rarely been found in prokaryotes. a gene for [cu,zn]-sod (sodc) has recently been cloned from haemophilus influenzae type b and h. parainfluenzae, so other haemophilus and related species were screened for the presence of [cu,zn]-sods by visualization of bands of sod activity in non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels and by gene probing. strains of h. aphrophilus, h. paraphrophilus, h. haemolyticus, h. paraphrohaemolyticus, some non-typable h. influenzae, h. haemoglobinophilus (canis) and h. parasuis were all found to have [cu,zn]-sod activity (inhibited by 2 mm-cyanide) in polyacrylamide gels. in a southern blot analysis, dna from h. aphrophilus, h. paraphrophilus, h. haemolyticus and [cu,zn]-sod-containing non-typable h. influenzae--but not the other species--hybridized to a 360 nucleotide dna probe containing the 5'-part of sodc cloned from h. influenzae type b. bacterial [cu,zn]-sods are more prevalent than has previously been recognized.
