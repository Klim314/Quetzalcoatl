TI  == the beneficial effects of microflora, especially obligate anaerobes, and their products on the colonic environment in inflammatory bowel disease.
AB  == because intestinal microflora play a pivotal role in the development of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), there is currently some interest in alternating the composition of the microflora toward a potentially more remedial community. this paper summarizes the clinical and experimental efficacy of the manipulation  of microflora by the use of antibiotics, probiotics, and prebiotics in ibd. germinated barley foodstuff (gbf) is a prebiotic whose unique characteristics make it highly suitable for applications in ibd. it also helps prolong remission  in remissive ulcerative colitis (uc) patients and also attenuates clinical activity in non-remissive uc patients. gbf has shown to be converted into a preferential nutrient, butyrate, for colonocytes through the action of eubacterium and bifidobacterium, and this bacterial butyrate can provide anti-inflammatory effects. the probiotic approaches for ibd include vsl#3, nissle1917, clostridium butyricum, and bifidobacterium-fermented milk. in this paper, we summarize the distinctive role of another probiotic, eubacterium limosum (e. limosum), which is a commensal microorganism that is promoted by gbf  administration. the metabolites of e. limosum included butyrate, which can accelerate intestinal epithelial growth and inhibit il-6 production. this new probiotic approach may be useful as an adjunctive ibd treatment in the future. although these strategies hold great promise and appear to be useful in some settings, more experimental and clinical studies are needed to firmly establish their relevance.

TI  == increased growth of bifidobacterium and eubacterium by germinated barley foodstuff, accompanied by enhanced butyrate production in healthy volunteers.
AB  == germinated barley foodstuff (gbf) derived from the aleurone and scutellum fractions of germinated barley mainly consists of low-lignified hemicellulose and glutamine-rich protein. gbf improves the proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells and defecation, through the bacterial production of short chain fatty acids (scfa), especially butyrate. in this study we investigated the mechanism of production of butyrate by microflora in humans and in vitro. daily administration of 9 g gbf for 14 successive days significantly increased fecal butyrate content. fecal bifidobacterium and eubacterium were also significantly increased by gbf administration in healthy volunteers. ten anaerobic micro-organisms selected from intestinal microflora were cultured in vitro in the medium containing gbf as a sole carbon source (gbf medium). after a 3-day incubation, 7 strains (bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, bacteroides ovatus, clostridium butyricum, and  eubacterium limosum) lowered the medium ph producing scfa. eubacterium grown together with bifidobacterium in gbf medium efficiently produced butyrate. on the other hand, gbf changed the intestinal microflora and increased probiotics such as bifidobacterium in the intestinal tract. as a result, butyrate was produced by the mutual action of eubacterium and bifidobacterium. this butyrate is considered to enhance the proliferation of colonic epithelial cells.

TI  == formation of amphetamine from its nitro analogue by anaerobic intestinal bacteria.
AB  == 1. microbial reduction of 1-phenyl-2-nitropropane 1 was carried out using 40 strains of intestinal anaerobic bacteria. among them, 12 strains (mitsuokella multiacidus, clostridium perfringens, c. innocuum, c. clostiriiforme, c. difficile, c. butyricum, c. sp., eubacterium limosum, e. aerofaciens, e. multiforme, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and p. productus) had the ability to reduce 1 to amphetamine 2 (0.1-1% yield). 2. clostridium species were more active than another intestinal anaerobic bacteria. 3. when clostridium perfringens was used in preparative fermentation, the yield of 2 was increased, and its absolute  structure had an (s)-configuration with an optical purity of 68% in enantiomeric  excess.
