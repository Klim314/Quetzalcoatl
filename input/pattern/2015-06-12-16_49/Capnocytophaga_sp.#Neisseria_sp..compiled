TI  - Alcohol and tobacco consumption affects bacterial richness in oral cavity mucosa  biofilms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Today there are more than 2 billion alcohol users and about 1.3 billion tobacco users worldwide. The chronic and heavy use of these two substances is at the heart of numerous diseases and may wreak havoc on the human oral microbiome. This study delves into the changes that alcohol and tobacco may cause on biofilms of the human oral microbiome. To do so, we used swabs to sample the oral biofilm of 22 subjects; including 9 control-individuals with no or very low consumption of alcohol and no consumption of tobacco, 7 who were chronic and heavy users of both substances and 6 active smokers that reported no significant alcohol consumption. DNA was extracted from swabs and the V1 region of the 16S rRNA gene was PCR amplified and sequenced using the Ion Torrent PGM platform, generating 3.7 million high quality reads. DNA sequences were clustered and OTUs were assigned using the ARB SILVA database and Qiime. RESULTS: We found no differences in species diversity and evenness among the groups. However, we found a significant decrease in species richness in only smokers and in smokers/drinkers when compared to controls. We found that Neisseria abundance was significantly decreased in both groups when compared to controls. Smokers had significant increases in Prevotella and Capnocytophaga and reductions in Granulicatella, Staphylococcus, Peptostreptococcus and Gemella when compared to the two other groups. Controls showed higher abundance of Aggregibacter, whilst smokers/drinkers had lower abundances of Fusobacteria. Samples from only smokers clustered closer together than to controls and smokers/drinkers, and also had a significant reduction in inter-group dissimilarity distances, indicating a more homogenous group than controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the continued use of tobacco or alcohol plus tobacco significantly reduces bacterial richness, which apparently leads to a reduction in inter-group variability, turning the respective biofilms into a more homogenous microenvironment in terms of bacterial community composition, with possible consequences for human oral diseases.
TI  - The cultivable human oral gluten-degrading microbiome and its potential implications in coeliac disease and gluten sensitivity.
AB  - Coeliac disease is characterized by intestinal inflammation caused by gluten, proteins which are widely contained in the Western diet. Mammalian digestive enzymes are only partly capable of cleaving gluten, and fragments remain that induce toxic responses in patients with coeliac disease. We found that the oral microbiome is a novel and rich source of gluten-degrading organisms. Here we report on the isolation and characterization of the cultivable resident oral microbes that are capable of cleaving gluten, with special emphasis on the immunogenic domains. Bacteria were obtained by a selective culturing approach and enzyme activities were characterized by: (i) hydrolysis of paranitroanilide-derivatized gliadin-derived tripeptide substrates; (ii) gliadin degradation in-gel (gliadin zymography); (iii) gliadin degradation in solution; (iv) proteolysis of the highly immunogenic alpha-gliadin-derived 33-mer peptide. For selected strains pH activity profiles were determined. The culturing strategy yielded 87 aerobic and 63 anaerobic strains. Species with activity in at least two of the four assays were typed as: Rothia mucilaginosa HOT-681, Rothia aeria HOT-188, Actinomyces odontolyticus HOT-701, Streptococcus mitis HOT-677, Streptococcus sp. HOT-071, Neisseria mucosa HOT-682 and Capnocytophaga sputigena HOT-775, with Rothia species being active in all four assays. Cleavage specificities and substrate preferences differed among the strains identified. The approximate molecular weights of the enzymes were ~75 kD (Rothia spp.), ~60 kD (A. odontolyticus) and ~150 kD (Streptococcus spp.). In conclusion, this study identified new gluten-degrading microorganisms in the upper gastrointestinal tract. A cocktail of the most active oral bacteria, or their isolated enzymes, may offer promising new treatment modalities for coeliac disease.
TI  - Impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (RP) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [GR]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM) analysis. METHODS: Individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or >3 sites with AL >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GR (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >/=2.5 mm after treatment. Subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM analysis. Significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the Wilcoxon test. RESULTS: The majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. Species that increased or persisted in high frequency in RP but were significantly reduced in GR included Bacteroidetes sp., Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Tannerella forsythia, Dialister spp., Selenomonas spp., Catonella morbi, Eubacterium spp., Filifactor alocis, Parvimonas micra, Peptostreptococcus sp. OT113, Fusobacterium sp. OT203, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Streptococcus intermedius or Streptococcus constellatus, and Shuttlesworthia satelles. In contrast, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Gemella haemolysans, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Kingella oralis, Lautropia mirabilis, Neisseria elongata, Rothia dentocariosa, Streptococcus australis, and Veillonella spp. were more associated with therapeutic success. CONCLUSION: Persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.
TI  - Bacterial 16S sequence analysis of severe caries in young permanent teeth.
AB  - Previous studies have confirmed the association of the acid producers Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus spp. with childhood caries, but they also suggested these microorganisms are not sufficient to explain all cases of caries. In addition, health-associated bacterial community profiles are not well understood, including the importance of base production and acid catabolism in pH homeostasis. The bacterial community composition in health and in severe caries of the young permanent dentition was compared using Sanger sequencing of the ribosomal 16S rRNA genes. Lactobacillus species were dominant in severe caries, and levels rose significantly as caries progressed from initial to deep lesions. S. mutans was often observed at high levels in the early stages of caries but also in some healthy subjects and was not statistically significantly associated with caries progression in the overall model. Lactobacillus or S. mutans was found either at low levels or not present in several samples. Other potential acid producers observed at high levels in these subjects included strains of Selenomonas, Neisseria, and Streptococcus mitis. Propionibacterium FMA5 was significantly associated with caries progression but was not found at high levels. An overall loss of community diversity occurred as caries progressed, and species that significantly decreased included the Streptococcus mitis-S. pneumoniae-S. infantis group, Corynebacterium matruchotii, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus cristatus, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Eubacterium IR009, Campylobacter rectus, and Lachnospiraceae sp. C1. The relationship of acid-base metabolism to 16S rRNA gene-based species assignments appears to be complex, and metagenomic approaches that would allow functional profiling of entire genomes will be helpful in elucidating the microbial pathogenesis of caries.
TI  - Subgingival microbial profiles of smokers with periodontitis.
AB  - The subgingival microbiome is largely uncultivated, and therefore, cultivation-based and targeted molecular approaches have limited value in examining the effect of smoking on this community. We tested the hypothesis that the subgingival biofilm is compositionally different in current and never-smokers by using an open-ended molecular approach for bacterial identification. Subgingival plaque from deep sites of current and never-smokers matched for disease was analyzed by 16S sequencing. Smokers demonstrated greater abundance of Parvimonas, Fusobacterium, Campylobacter, Bacteroides, and Treponema and lower levels of Veillonella, Neisseria, and Streptococcus. Several uncultivated Peptostreptococci, Parvimonas micra, Campylobacter gracilis, Treponema socranskii, Dialister pneumosintes, and Tannerella forsythia were elevated in this group, while Veillonella sp. oral clone B2, Neisseria sp. oral clone 2.24, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Capnocytophaga sp. clone AH015 were at lower levels. The microbial profile of smoking-associated periodontitis is distinct from that of non-smokers, with significant differences in the prevalence and abundance of disease-associated and health-compatible organisms.
TI  - Microbiological findings in subjects with asymptomatic oral lichen planus: a cross-sectional comparative study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The bacterial colonization of the oral mucosa was evaluated in patients with asymptomatic oral lichen planus (OLP) and compared to the microbiologic status in mucosally healthy subjects. METHODS: Bacteria from patients with clinically and histopathologically diagnosed OLP from the Stomatology Service, Department of Oral Surgery and Stomatology, School of Dental Medicine, University of Bern, were collected with a non-invasive swab system. Samples were taken from OLP lesions on the gingiva and from non-affected sites on the contralateral side of the mouth. The control population did not have OLP and was recruited from the student clinic. All samples were processed with the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method using well-defined bacterial species for the analysis. RESULTS: Significantly higher bacterial counts of Bacteroides ureolyticus (P = 0.001), Dialister species (sp.) (P = 0.006), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (P = 0.007), and Streptococcus agalactiae (P = 0.006) were found in samples taken from OLP lesions compared to sites with no clinical evidence of OLP. Significantly higher bacterial counts were found for Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eikenella corrodens, Lactobacillus crispatus, Mobiluncus curtisii, Neisseria mucosa, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella intermedia, and S. agalactiae at sites with lesions in subjects with OLP compared to sites in control subjects (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Microbiologic differences were found between sites with OLP and sites in subjects without a diagnosis of OLP. Specifically, higher counts of staphylococci and S. agalactiae were found in OLP lesions.
TI  - Microbiological evaluation of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without sinus tract.
AB  - AIM: To examine the microbiological status of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without a sinus tract. METHODOLOGY: Samples were collected by means of a size 15 H-type file and two sterile paper points from 30 cases of primary endodontic infections with (n = 15) or without (n = 15) a sinus tract. The presence of 40 bacterial species was determined by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. RESULTS: The species found at the highest levels and prevalence were Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. vincentii, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Enterococcus faecalis, Campylobacter gracilis and Neisseria mucosa. Total bacterial counts were similar between teeth with (44 x 10(5)) and without (50 x 10(5)) a sinus tract (t-test: P > 0.05). E. faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus, Capnocytophaga sputigena and Capnocytophaga gingivalis had significantly higher counts in the absence of sinus tract (Mann-Whitney test, P < 0.05). Higher levels of P. gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum were observed in cases with a sinus tract. Leptotrichia buccalis (OR = 1.83; CI 95%) and Porphyromonas endodontalis (OR = 2.15; CI 95%) were associated with an increased chance of subjects having a sinus tract. CONCLUSIONS: Primary endodontic infections were associated with a large variety of bacterial species. Specific differences between the composition of the microbiota of primary root canal infections were observed in cases with or without a sinus tract.
TI  - Infection at titanium implants with or without a clinical diagnosis of inflammation.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the microbiota at implants diagnosed with peri-implantitis, implant mucositis, or being clinically healthy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical and microbiological data were collected from 213 subjects (mean age: 65.7+/-14) with 976 implants in function (mean: 10.8 years, SD+/-1.5). Forty species were identified by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. RESULTS: Implant mean % plaque score was 41.8+/-32.4%. Periodontitis defined by bone loss was found in 44.9% of subjects. Implant mucositis was diagnosed in 59% and peri-implantitis in 14.9% of all cases. Neisseria mucosa, Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum, F. nucleatum sp. polymorphum, and Capnocytophaga sputigena dominated the implant sub-mucosal microbiota and the sub-gingival microbiota at tooth sites. Implant probing pocket depth at the implant site with the deepest probing depth was correlated with levels of Eikenella corrodens (r=0.16, P<0.05), the levels of F. nucleatum sp. vincentii (r=0.15, P<0.05), Porphyromonas gingivalis (r=0.14, P<0.05), and Micromonas micros (r=0.17, P=0.01). E. corrodens was found in higher levels at implants with mucositis compared with implant health (P<0.05). Subjects who lost teeth due to periodontitis had higher yields of F. nucleatum sp. vincentii (P<0.02) and N. mucosa (P<0.05). Independent of implant status subjects with teeth had higher levels of P. gingivalis (P<0.05), and Leptotrichia buccalis (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: At implant sites studied, few bacteria differed by whether subjects were dentate or not or by implant status.
TI  - Detection and characterization of beta-lactamase genes in subgingival bacteria from patients with refractory periodontitis.
AB  - Fifty-three beta-lactamase-producing strains of oral bacteria isolated from patients with refractory periodontitis in Norway and USA were screened for the presence of the bla(TEM), bla(SHV), bla(OXA), bla(ampC), bla(cfxA), and bla(cepA/cblA) genes by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR products were characterized by direct sequencing of the amplified DNA. Thirty-four of the 53 enzyme-producing strains (64%) were positive in one of the PCR assays. All beta-lactamase-producing Prevotella and Capnocytophaga spp. were CfxA positive. TEM-type beta-lactamases were identified in one strain each of Escherichia coli and Neisseria sp., and one strain of Citrobacter freundii possessed an AmpC-type beta-lactamase. Screening for gene cassettes and genes known to be associated with integrons did not reveal the presence of integrons in these oral bacteria. Sequence analyses showed that most CfxA positive Prevotella and Capnocytophaga isolates from patients with refractory periodontitis harboured variants of the CfxA2 and CfxA3 enzyme. The present study also showed that many different genetic determinants of beta-lactamase production are found in bacteria isolated from refractory periodontitis, many of which remain to be characterized.
TI  - Beta-lactamase production and antimicrobial susceptibility of subgingival bacteria from refractory periodontitis.
AB  - This study assessed the extent of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in subgingival plaque samples obtained from 25 patients with refractory marginal periodontitis in the USA. beta-Lactamase-positive isolates were characterized using commercial diagnostic kits and partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The susceptibilities to different antimicrobial agents were tested and, in addition, the isolates were screened for the presence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were detected in 18 (72%) patients. The most prominent beta-lactamase-producing organisms belonged to the anaerobic genus Prevotella. Other enzyme-producing anaerobic strains were Fusobacterium nucleatum, Propionibacterium acnes and Peptostreptococcus sp. Facultative bacteria, such as Burkholderia spp., Ralstonia pickettii, Capnocytophaga spp., Bacillus spp., Staphylococcus spp. and Neisseria sp., were also detected among the enzyme-producers. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ampicillin and amoxicillin were in the range 1.5-256 micrograms/ml and 4-256 micrograms/ml, respectively, for the isolates of the Prevotella species. All Prevotella isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate and metronidazole, but they showed variable resistance to tetracyclines. Two of the Prevotella isolates had high MICs of cefotaxime and ceftazidime. ESBL activity was not detected in any of the beta-lactamase-producing isolates by the Etest method. Thus, our study demonstrated a wide variety of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria that may play a role in refractory periodontal disease.
TI  - Prevalent bacterial species and novel phylotypes in advanced noma lesions.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the bacterial diversity in advanced noma lesions using culture-independent molecular methods. 16S ribosomal DNA bacterial genes from DNA isolated from advanced noma lesions of four Nigerian children were PCR amplified with universally conserved primers and spirochetal selective primers and cloned into Escherichia coli. Partial 16S rRNA sequences of approximately 500 bases from 212 cloned inserts were used initially to determine species identity or closest relatives by comparison with sequences of known species or phylotypes. Nearly complete sequences of approximately 1,500 bases were obtained for most of the potentially novel species. A total of 67 bacterial species or phylotypes were detected, 25 of which have not yet been grown in vitro. Nineteen of the species or phylotypes, including Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus spp., and the opportunistic pathogens Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Ochrobactrum anthropi were detected in more than one subject. Other known species that were detected included Achromobacter spp., Afipia spp., Brevundimonas diminuta, Capnocytophaga spp., Cardiobacterium sp., Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium spp., Gemella haemoylsans, and Neisseria spp. Phylotypes that were unique to noma infections included those in the genera Eubacterium, Flavobacterium, Kocuria, Microbacterium, and Porphyromonas and the related Streptococcus salivarius and genera Sphingomonas and TREPONEMA: Since advanced noma lesions are infections open to the environment, it was not surprising to detect species not commonly associated with the oral cavity, e.g., from soil. Several species previously implicated as putative pathogens of noma, such as spirochetes and Fusobacterium spp., were detected in at least one subject. However, due to the limited number of available noma subjects, it was not possible at this time to associate specific species with the disease.
TI  - Comparison of GC-Lect and modified Thayer-Martin media for isolation of Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
AB  - A new selective medium, GC-Lect, was compared with modified Thayer-Martin medium  (MTM) for isolation of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Cultures from 620 sexually transmitted disease clinic patients were directly inoculated onto both media, placed in candle extinction jars, and incubated. N. gonorrhoeae was isolated from 175 (29%) of 607 genital cultures, 3 (3%) of 88 pharyngeal cultures, and 6 (29%) of 21 rectal cultures. Ten cultures were positive only on GC-Lect, and 3 were positive only on MTM. In 3 of the 10 cultures positive only on GC-Lect, overgrowth of a Capnocytophaga sp. may have obscured growth on MTM. In this study, vancomycin-susceptible (MIC, less than 4.0 micrograms/ml) N. gonorrhoeae was isolated on both media, and none of the isolates missed by either medium were susceptible to vancomycin. No differences were noted between the two media in time required for isolation of N. gonorrhoeae. While isolation rates of N. gonorrhoeae were similar, suppression of nongonococcal bacterial species by GC-Lect was superior to that by MTM. GC-Lect is equal to MTM for detection of N. gonorrhoeae and is superior for suppression of normal flora.
