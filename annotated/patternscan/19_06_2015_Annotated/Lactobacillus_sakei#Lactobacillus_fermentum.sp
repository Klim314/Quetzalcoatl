TI  == molecular identification and quantification of lactic acid bacteria in traditional fermented dairy foods of russia.
AB  == russian traditional fermented dairy foods have been consumed for thousands of years. however, little research has focused on exploiting lactic acid bacteria (lab) resources and analyzing the lab composition of russian traditional fermented dairy foods. in the present study, we cultured lab isolated from fermented mare and cow milks, sour cream, and cheese collected from kalmykiya, buryats, and tuva regions of russia. seven lactobacillus species and the bifidobacterium genus were quantified by quantitative pcr. the lab counts in these samples ranged from 3.18 to 9.77 log cfu/ml (or per gram). in total, 599 lab strains were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. the identified lab belonged to 7 genera and 30 species by 16s  rrna and mure gene sequencing and multiplex pcr assay. the predominant lab isolates were lactobacillus helveticus (176 strains) and lactobacillus plantarum  (63 strains), which represented 39.9% of all isolates. the quantitative pcr results revealed that counts of 7 lactobacilli species and bifidobacterium spp. of 30 fermented cow milk samples ranged from 1.19 +/- 0.34 (lactobacillus helveticus in tuva) to 8.09 +/- 0.71 (lactobacillus acidophilus in kalmykiya) log cfu/ml of fermented cow milk (mean +/- standard error). the numbers of bifidobacterium spp., lb. plantarum, lb. helveticus, and lb. acidophilus revealed no significant difference between the 3 regions; nevertheless, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus sakei, and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus exhibited different degrees of variation across 3 regions. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of russia have complex compositions of lab species. the diversity of lab might be related to the type of fermented dairy product, geographical origin, and manufacturing process.

TI  == a methodological approach to screen diverse cheese-related bacteria for their ability to produce aroma compounds.
AB  == microorganisms play an important role in the development of cheese flavor. the aim of this study was to develop an approach to facilitate screening of various cheese-related bacteria for their ability to produce aroma compounds. we combined i) curd-based slurry medium incubated under conditions mimicking cheese manufacturing and ripening, ii) powerful method of extraction of volatiles, headspace trap, coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (hs-trap-gc-ms),  and iii) metabolomics-based method of data processing using the xcms package of r software and multivariate analysis. this approach was applied to eleven species:  five lactic acid bacteria (leuconostoc lactis, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus helveticus), four actinobacteria (brachybacterium articum, brachybacterium tyrofermentans, brevibacterium aurantiacum, and microbacterium gubbeenense), propionibacterium freudenreichii, and hafnia alvei. all the strains grew, with maximal populations  ranging from 7.4 to 9.2 log (cfu/ml). in total, 52 volatile aroma compounds were  identified, of which 49 varied significantly in abundance between bacteria. principal component analysis of volatile profiles differentiated species by their ability to produce ethyl esters (associated with brachybacteria), sulfur compounds and branched-chain alcohols (h. alvei), branched-chain acids (h. alvei, p. freudenreichii and l. paracasei), diacetyl and related carbonyl compounds (m.  gubbeenense and l. paracasei), among others.

TI  == antifungal activity of lactobacilli and its relationship with 3-phenyllactic acid production.
AB  == in this study, 13 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains (including 5 lactobacillus casei, 2 lactobacillus rhamnosus, 2 lactobacillus fermentum, 1 lactobacillus acidophilus, 1 lactobacillus plantarum, 1 lactobacillus sakei, and 1 lactobacillus reuteri species) were assessed for both their antifungal activity against four food spoilage molds (colletotrichum gloeosporioides, botrytis cinerea, penicillium expansum, and aspergillus flavus) and their capability to produce the novel antimicrobial compound 3-phenyllactic acid (pla). results demonstrated that all molds were sensitive to varying degrees to the cell-free supernatants (cfs) from lab fermentations (p<0.05), with growth inhibitions ranging from 2.65% to 66.82%. the inhibition ability of cfs was not affected by a heating treatment (121 degrees c, 20 min); however, it declined markedly when the ph of cfs was adjusted to 6.5. with the exception of l. plantarum nrrl b-4496 and l. acidophilus atcc-4495, all other lab strains produced pla ranging from 0.021 to 0.275 mm. the high minimum inhibitory concentration for commercial pla (3.01-36.10mm) suggests that it cannot be considered the only compound related with the antifungal potential of studied lab and that synergistic effects may exist among other metabolism products.

TI  == development of bacteria identification array to detect lactobacilli in thai fermented sausage.
AB  == to improve the quality and safety of food products, there is a need in the food industry for a reliable method for simultaneously monitoring multiple bacterial strains. microarray technology is a high-throughput screening approach that can provide an alternative for bacteria detection. a total of 164 bacteria-specific probes were designed from 16s rrna gene sequences to target 12 bacteria species,  including lactic acid bacteria and selected food pathogens. after fabrication onto aminosilane-coated slides, hybridization conditions of the array were optimized for high specificity and signal intensities. the array was applied to detect 12 bacteria individually and was specific to all (lactobacillus plantarum  group, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. delbrueckii, l. casei, l. sakei, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus and listeria monocytogenes) except l. animalis. multiplex detection using mixed bacteria populations was evaluated and accurate detection was obtained. the feasibility of using the array to detect the target bacteria in food was evaluated with thai fermented sausages  (nham). meat samples were collected on days 2, 3 and 7 after natural fermentation, l. plantarum-inoculated fermentation and l. brevis-inoculated fermentation before applying to the array. the naturally-fermented nham contained l. sakei, l. delbrueckii, l. plantarum and l. fermentum. the l. plantarum-inoculated nham showed a similar lactic acid bacteria population but the positive signal level for l. plantarum was higher than with natural fermentation. the l. brevis-inoculated nham contained l. brevis, l. plantarum, l. delbrueckii and l. fermentum. the array was used to monitor bacteria population dynamics during the fermentation process. the naturally-fermented and l. brevis-inoculated samples showed lower positive signal levels of l. plantarum on  day 2, but signals gradually increased on days 3 and 7 of the fermentation. in contrast, the l. plantarum-started fermentation showed a higher positive signal level on day 2 than the natural and l. brevis-inoculated samples, and the positive signal level remained high on days 3 and 7. the bacteria identification  array was proven to be useful as an alternative method to detect and monitor target bacteria populations during food fermentation.

TI  == characterization of tetracycline resistance lactobacilli isolated from swine intestines at western area of taiwan.
AB  == to investigate the frequency of tetracycline resistance (tet-r) lactobacilli in pig intestines, a total of 256 pig colons were analyzed and found to contain typical colonies of tet-r lactic acid bacteria in every sample, ranging from 3.2  x 10(3) to 6.6 x 10(5) cfu/cm(2). from these samples, a total of 159 isolates of  tet-r lactobacilli were obtained and identified as belonging to 11 species, including lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus amylovorus, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus ruminis, lactobacillus kefiri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus coryniformis, lactobacillus parabuchneri and lactobacillus letivazi. based on the efsa (2008) breakpoints, all isolates, after mic analysis, were qualified as tet-r, from which the significant high tet-r mic(50) and mic(90) values indicated an ecological distribution of tet-r lactobacilli mostly with high resistance potency in pig colons. pcr-detection identified 5 tet genes in these isolates, the most predominant one being tet (w), followed by tet (m), (l), (k), and (q). their detection rates were 82.0%, 22.5%, 14.4%, 8.1% and 0.9%, respectively. noteworthily, isolates of the same species carrying identical tet gene(s) usually had a wide different mic values. furthermore, strain-subtyping of these isolates  by rep-pcr demonstrated a notable genotypic biodiversity % (average = 62%).

TI  == prevalence and impact of single-strain starter cultures of lactic acid bacteria on metabolite formation in sourdough.
AB  == flavour of type ii sourdoughs is influenced by the ingredients, processing conditions, and starter culture composition. it is, however, not fully clear to what extent different sourdough lactic acid bacteria (lab) contribute to flavour. therefore, two types of flour (rye and wheat) and different lab starter culture strains were used to prepare sourdoughs, thereby leaving the yeast microbiota uncontrolled. all lab starter culture strains tested were shown to be prevalent and to acidify the flour/water mixture to ph values between 3.1 and 3.9 after 24h of fermentation. multiple aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, and carboxylic acids were produced by the sourdough-associated microbiota throughout the fermentation period. based on the organoleptic evaluation of breads produced with these sourdoughs, five lab strains were selected to perform prolonged wheat and rye fermentations as to their capacity to result in an acidic (lactobacillus fermentum imdo 130101, lactobacillus plantarum imdo 130201, and lactobacillus crustorum lmg 23699), buttermilk-like (lactobacillus amylovorus dce 471), or fruity flavour (lactobacillus sakei cg1). upon prolonged fermentation, higher metabolite concentrations were produced. for instance, l. sakei cg1 produced the  highest amounts of 3-methyl-1-butanol, which was further converted into 3-methylbutyl acetate. the latter compound resulted in a fruity banana flavour after 48h of fermentation, probably due to yeast interference. rye fermentations  resulted in sourdoughs richer in volatiles than wheat, including 3-methyl-1-butanol, 2-phenylethanol, and ethyl acetate.

TI  == diversity and metabolic impact of intestinal lactobacillus species in healthy adults and the elderly.
AB  == the present study aimed at assessing the counts and species distribution of intestinal lactobacilli and exploring if the data are associated with bmi and blood glucose level in healthy adults and elderly persons. the bmi (p < 0.01), the level of fasting blood glucose (p < 0.001) and the total counts of lactobacilli (p < 0.01 by bacteriology; p < 0.001 by real-time pcr) were higher in the elderly. the number of species in adults was lower (p < 0.05), who were more often colonised with lactobacillus acidophilus (p = 0.031) and l. helveticus (p < 0.001). in contrast, l. plantarum (p = 0.035), l. paracasei (p < 0.001) and  l. reuteri (p = 0.031) were more prevalent in the elderly. l. rhamnosus was detected in adults (p < 0.001), but not in any elderly person. bmi was associated with counts of lactobacilli, adjusted for age and sex (p = 0.008). the higher bmi in both groups of persons was associated with the presence of obligate homofermentative lactobacilli and l. sakei, both adjusted for age and sex. plasma glucose values were positively correlated with bmi and negatively correlated with colonisation with l. paracasei (p = 0.0238) in adults and on the borderline with  l. fermentum (p = 0.052) in the elderly. thus, the species-specific pcr analysis  of lactobacillus sp. combined with viable plating data indicates substantial age-related structural differences in the intestinal lactobacilli communities. the higher counts of intestinal lactobacillus sp. are associated with higher bmi  and blood glucose content, while their specific fermentative groups and species of lactobacilli appear at different glucose levels both in adults and in the elderly.

TI  == potential beneficial properties of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from smoked salmon.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the probiotic properties of strains isolated from smoked salmon and previously identified as bacteriocin producers. methods and results: strains  lactobacillus curvatus et06, et30 and et31, lactobacillus fermentum et35, lactobacillus delbrueckii et32, pediococcus acidilactici et34 and enterococcus faecium et05, et12 and et88 survived conditions simulating the gastrointestinal tract (git) and produced bacteriocins active against several strains of listeria  monocytogenes, but presented very low activity against other lactic acid bacteria (lab). cell-free supernatants containing bacteriocins, added to 3-h-old cultures  of l. monocytogenes 603, suppressed growth over 12 h. auto-aggregation was strain-specific, and values ranged from 7.2% for et35 to 12.1% for et05. various  degrees of co-aggregation with l. monocytogenes 603, lactobacillus sakei atcc 15521 and enterococcus faecalis atcc 19443 were observed. adherence of the bacteriocinogenic strains to caco-2 cells was within the range reported for lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, a well-known probiotic. the highest levels of hydrophobicity were recorded for lact. curvatus (61.9-64.6%), lact. fermentum (78.9%), lact. delbrueckii (43.7%) and ped. acidilactici (51.3%), which are higher than the one recorded for lact. rhamnosus gg (53.3%). these strains were highly sensitive to several antibiotics and affected by several drugs from different generic groups in a strain-dependent manner. conclusions: smoked salmon is a rich source of probiotic lab. all strains survived conditions simulating the git and produced bacteriocins active against various pathogens. adherence to caco-2 cells was within the range reported for lact. rhamnosus gg, a well-known probiotic. in addition, the high hydrophobicity readings recorded define the strains as good probiotics.

TI  == phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. however, the phylogenetic relationships among lab species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. results: we performed a phylogenetic analysis of lab species based on 232 genes from 28 lab genome sequences. regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. the lab species examined were divided into two groups. group 1 included families enterococcaceae and streptococcaceae. group 2 included families lactobacillaceae and leuconostocaceae. within group 2, the lab species were divided into two clades. one clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus  lactobacillus and two other species, lb. sakei and lb. casei. in the acidophilus  complex, lb. delbrueckii separated first, while lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus and lb. gasseri/lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. the other clade within group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, lb.  salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. reuteri, lb. fermentum, and the genera pediococcus, oenococcus, and leuconostoc. in this clade, lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to lb. plantarum/lb. brevis pair and pediococcus, and the other including oenococcus/leuconostoc pair and lb. reuteri/lb. fermentum pair. in addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be  more useful than others. the genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (trsb), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein b (uvrb), dna polymerase iii (polc) and penicillin binding protein 2b (pbpb). conclusions: our  phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of lab species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. we infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in lab species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. further analyses of more genes from additional, representative lab species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of lab species to various environmental niches.

TI  == antibiotic resistance and molecular characterization of probiotic and clinical lactobacillus strains in relation to safety aspects of probiotics.
AB  == the evaluation of the safety of probiotic strains includes the exclusion of antibiotic resistance of clinical importance. ninety-two strains from the genus lactobacillus isolated from probiotics, food, and clinical sources were included  in the investigation. species tested were the l. acidophilus group, l. casei group, l. reuteri/fermentum group, and l. sakei/curvatus group. cell and colony morphology, fermentation patterns, and growth characteristics as well as soluble  whole cell proteins were analyzed. antibiotic resistance against clinically important agents was determined by broth dilution tests. the vana and tet genes were confirmed. resistances occurred mainly against gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, sulfonamides, and, in some cases, glycopeptides. the natural glycopeptide resistance within the l. casei group and l. reuteri appears to be not of clinical relevance, as there was no vana gene present. therefore, the transfer of this resistance is very unlikely. tet-(a), -(b), -(c), -(m), or -(o)  gene could not be detected. the protein fingerprinting within the l. casei group  proved that l. rhamnosus strains of clinical origin clustered together with probiotic strains. for safety evaluations resistance patterns of a broad range of strains are a useful criterion together with the exclusion of known resistance genes (like the vana gene) and can be used for decision making on the safety of probiotics, both by authorization bodies and manufacturers.

TI  == identification and characterization of a glucan-producing enzyme from lactobacillus hilgardii tmw 1.828 involved in granule formation of water kefir.
AB  == water kefir is a home made fermented beverage based on a sucrose solution with fruit extracts. the inoculum of such fermentations consists of macroscopic granula containing lactic and acetic acid bacteria, and yeasts, which are embedded in an exopolysaccharide (eps) matrix. in this work, a strain of lactobacillus hilgardii producing large amounts of the granule-forming dextran could be isolated. the glycosyltransferans (gtf) commonly called glucansucrase responsible for the production of this dextran was purified from l. hilgardii. characteristic enzyme kinetic data were obtained. optimum activity was observed between ph 4.3 and 4.6 and temperatures between 40 degrees c and 45 degrees c. a  michaelis-menten kinetic could be fit to the experimental data and a k(m) of 0.0385 m was calculated. the corresponding gtf gene was identified and characterized. it encodes a 1448 amino acid protein with higher homologies to gtfs of lactobacillus parabuchneri, lactobacillus sakei and lactobacillus fermentum followed by lower homologies to lactobacillus reuteri gtfs. by knockout experiments the role of this gene in granule dextran production was demonstrated.

TI  == factors affecting the adsorption of bacteriocins to lactobacillus sakei and enterococcus sp.
AB  == bacteriocins bacjw3bz and bacjw6bz produced by lactobacillus plantarum, and bacjw11bz and bacjw15bz produced by lactobacillus fermentum, inhibit gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. treatment of enterococcus sp. hklhs and lactobacillus sakei dsm 20017 with these bacteriocins deformed the cells and resulted in dna and beta-galactosidase leakage. the bacteriocins adsorbed to sensitive and resistant strains. optimal adsorption of bacjw3bz and bacjw6bz to enterococcus sp. hklhs was recorded at ph 10.0, whereas adsorption of bacjw11bz and bacjw15bz was favored at ph 4.0-8.0 and 2.0-4.0, respectively. adsorption to  l. sakei dsm 20017 was less influenced by ph. incubation temperature had a major  influence on the adsorption of bacjw6bz and bacjw11bz to sensitive cells, with better results recorded below 30 degrees c. although variable results were recorded for bacjw3bz and bacjw15bz, optimal adsorption occurred between 37 and 60 degrees c. variable levels of adsorption were recorded in the presence of inorganic salts and solvents, and this seems to be species-specific. maximal adsorption (100%) was recorded for bacjw3bz and bacjw15bz to l. sakei dsm 20017 in the presence of most inorganic salts and solvents tested. maximal adsorption of bacjw6bz to enterococcus sp. hklhs (50%) was recorded in the presence of triton x-114 and little (17%) or no adsorption in the presence of other reagents.

TI  == glucan synthesis in the genus lactobacillus: isolation and characterization of glucansucrase genes, enzymes and glucan products from six different strains.
AB  == members of the genera streptococcus and leuconostoc synthesize various alpha-glucans (dextran, alternan and mutan). in lactobacillus, until now, the only glucosyltransferase (gtf) enzyme that has been characterized is gtfa of lactobacillus reuteri 121, the first gtf enzyme synthesizing a glucan (reuteran)  that contains mainly alpha-(1-->4) linkages together with alpha-(1-->6) and alpha-(1-->4,6) linkages. recently, partial sequences of glucansucrase genes were detected in other members of the genus lactobacillus. this paper reports, for the first time, isolation and characterization of dextransucrase and mutansucrase genes and enzymes from various lactobacillus species and the characterization of  the glucan products synthesized, which mainly have alpha-(1-->6)- and alpha-(1-->3)-glucosidic linkages. the four gtf enzymes characterized from three  different lb. reuteri strains are highly similar at the amino acid level, and consequently their protein structures are very alike. interestingly, these four lb. reuteri gtfs have relatively large n-terminal variable regions, containing rdv repeats, and relatively short putative glucan-binding domains with conserved  and less-conserved yg-repeating units. the three other gtf enzymes, isolated from lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus parabuchneri, contain smaller variable regions and larger putative glucan-binding domains compared to the lb. reuteri gtf enzymes.

TI  == microbiological characterization and probiotic potential of koko and koko sour water, african spontaneously fermented millet porridge and drink.
AB  == aims: to identify and examine the diversity of predominant lactic acid bacteria (lab) in koko and koko sour water (ksw) from different ghanaian production sites  with regard to pattern of fermentation (api 50 chl), genotype, antimicrobial activity, and resistance to low ph and bile salts. methods and results: in total  215 lab were isolated from koko and ksw. the isolates were identified using intergenic transcribed spacers (its)-pcr restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp), api 50 chl, restriction enzyme analysis with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (rea-pfge) and sequencing of the 16s rrna gene. the dominating micro-organisms in koko was found to be weisella confusa and lactobacillus fermentum, followed by lact. salivarius and pediococcus spp. chemometric data analysis were used to link the lab species to the different production stages and production sites. at intra-species level the isolates were found to have a great  diversity. the isolates were investigated for antimicrobial activity using agar diffusion assays, and acid and bile tolerance. most isolates showed low levels of antimicrobial activity towards the indicator strain listeria innocua, but not towards the bacteriocin-sensitive lact. sakei. growth of all lab isolates was unaffected by the presence of 0.3% (v/v) oxgall bile. the isolates were able to survive, but were not able to grow in growth medium adjusted to ph 2.5. conclusions: the dominating lab of koko and ksw were w. confusa and lact. fermentum showing a pronounced taxonomic biodiversity at sub-species level between stages within the production as well as between production sites. other species observed in ksw were lact. salivarius, ped. pentosaceus, ped. acidilactici and lact. paraplantarum. they occurred in levels of 108 cfu ml-1 in  fresh ksw and showed uniform antimicrobial activity, and acid and bile tolerance. significance and impact of the study: the present study gives a detailed picture  of the taxonomy and diversity of lab in an african-fermented millet product that  may have potential as a probiotic product for the local population. the chemometric tools principal component analysis and anova partial least squares regression were proven to be useful in the analysis of microbial groupings and associations with specific sites and stages in the production of koko and ksw.
