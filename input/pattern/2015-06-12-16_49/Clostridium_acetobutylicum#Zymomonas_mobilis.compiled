TI  - Molecular characterization of microbial alcohol dehydrogenases.
AB  - There is an astonishing array of microbial alcohol oxidoreductases. They display  a wide variety of substrate specificities and they fulfill several vital but quite different physiological functions. Some of these enzymes are involved in the production of alcoholic beverages and of industrial solvents, others are important in the production of vinegar, and still others participate in the degradation of naturally occurring and xenobiotic aromatic compounds as well as in the growth of bacteria and yeasts on methanol. They can be divided into three major categories. (1) The NAD- or NADP-dependent dehydrogenases. These can in turn be divided into the group I long-chain (approximately 350 amino acid residues) zinc-dependent enzymes such as alcohol dehydrogenases I, II, and III of Saccharomyces cerevisiae or the plasmid-encoded benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase of Pseudomonas putida; the group II short-chain (approximately 250 residues) zinc-independent enzymes such as ribitol dehydrogenase of Klebsiella aerogenes; the group III "iron-activated" enzymes that generally contain approximately 385 amino acid residues, such as alcohol dehydrogenase II of Zymomonas mobilis and alcohol dehydrogenase IV of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but may contain almost 900 residues in the case of the multifunctional alcohol dehydrogenases of Escherichia coli and Clostridium acetobutylicum. The aldehyde/alcohol oxidoreductase of Amycolatopsis methanolica and the methanol dehydrogenases of A. methanolica and Mycobacterium gasti are 4-nitroso-N,N-dimethylaniline-dependent nicotinoproteins. (2) NAD(P)-independent enzymes that use pyrroloquinoline quinone, haem or cofactor F420 as cofactor, exemplified by methanol dehydrogenase of Paracoccus denitrificans, ethanol dehydrogenase of Acetobacter and Gluconobacter spp. and the alcohol dehydrogenases of certain archaebacteria. (3) Oxidases that catalyze an essentially irreversible oxidation of alcohols, such as methanol oxidase of Hansenula polymorpha and probably the veratryl alcohol oxidases of certain fungi involved in lignin degradation. This review deals mainly with those enzymes for which complete amino acid sequences are available. The discussion focuses on a comparison of their primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures and their catalytic mechanisms. The physiological roles of the enzymes and isoenzymes are also considered, as are their probable evolutionary relationships.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of a gene from Bacillus stearothermophilus var. non-diastaticus encoding a glycerol dehydrogenase.
AB  - A 4.1-kb EcoRI fragment which includes the gene (gldA) encoding a glycerol dehydrogenase (G1DH; EC 1.1.1.6; glycerol:NAD oxidoreductase) from Bacillus stearothermophilus var. non-diastaticus has been cloned by virtue of its ability to restore glycerol utilisation to Escherichia coli glycerol kinase (glpK) and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (glpD) mutants. Sequencing suggests that the gldA gene is likely to be monocistronic and encodes a protein of 39450 Da. The deduced amino acid composition and sequence of G1DH reveals that the protein is extremely similar to a characterized metal-dependent NAD-dependent G1DH from B. stearothermophilus RS93. The enzyme has limited homology to the iron-activated alcohol dehydrogenase of Zymomonas mobilis and the butanol dehydrogenase of Clostridium acetobutylicum.
TI  - Electron microscopic analysis and biochemical characterization of a novel methanol dehydrogenase from the thermotolerant Bacillus sp. C1.
AB  - Methanol dehydrogenase from the thermotolerant Bacillus sp. C1 was studied by electron microscopy and image processing. Two main projections can be distinguished: one exhibits 5-fold symmetry and has a diameter of 15 nm, the other is rectangular with sides of 15 and 9 nm. Subsequent image processing showed that the 5-fold view possesses mirror symmetry. The rectangular views can be divided into two separate classes, one of which has 2-fold rotational symmetry. It is concluded that methanol dehydrogenase is a decameric molecule, and a tentative model is presented. The estimated molecular weight is 430,000, based on a subunit molecular weight of 43,000. The enzyme contains one zinc and one to two magnesium ions per subunit. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis revealed substantial similarity with alcohol dehydrogenases from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Zymomonas mobilis, Clostridium acetobutylicum, and Escherichia coli, which contain iron or zinc but no magnesium. In view of the aberrant structural and kinetic properties, it is proposed to distinguish the enzyme from common alcohol dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.1.1) by using the name NAD-dependent methanol dehydrogenase.
TI  - Molecular analysis and nucleotide sequence of the adh1 gene encoding an NADPH-dependent butanol dehydrogenase in the Gram-positive anaerobe Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a 2081-bp fragment of Clostridium acetobutylicum DNA containing the adh1 gene was determined. The butanol dehydrogenase gene is referred to as the adh1 gene since it was shown to have activity using butanol and ethanol as substrates. The adh1 gene consisted of 1164 bp and encoded an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) enzyme of 388 aa residues with an Mr of 43,274. The adh1 gene was separated from an upstream open reading frame by an intergenic region of 354 bp. No promoter consensus sequences were identified in the intergenic upstream region and the adh1 gene did not appear to be expressed off its own promoter in Escherichia coli. Three separate types of ADH have been recognized. The ADH1 from C. acetobutylicum exhibited 39% homology with the Fe-containing ADH2 from Zymomonas mobilis and 37% homology with the ADH4 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but showed little or no homology with the other characterised types of ADH.
