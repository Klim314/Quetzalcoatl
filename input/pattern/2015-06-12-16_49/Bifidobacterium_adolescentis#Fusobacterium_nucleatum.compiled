TI  - Coaggregation between and among human intestinal and oral bacteria.
AB  - Coaggregation is believed to facilitate the integration of new bacterial species  into polymicrobial communities. The aim of this study was to investigate coaggregation between and among human oral and enteric bacteria. Stationary phase cultures of 10 oral and 10 enteric species, chosen on the basis of numerical and ecological significance in their respective environments together with their ease of cultivation, were tested using a quantitative spectrophotometric coaggregation assay in all possible pairwise combinations to provide quantitative coaggregation scores. While 40% of possible partnerships coaggregated strongly for oral strains, strong interactions between oral and gut strains were considerably less common (4% incidence). Coaggregation scores were also weak between members of the intestinal microbiota (7% incidence), apart from Bacteroides fragilis with Clostridium perfringens, and Bifidobacterium adolescentis with C. perfringens. Oral and intestinal bacteria did not strongly interact, apart from B. adolescentis with Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces naeslundii with C. perfringens and F. nucleatum with Lactobacillus paracasei. Heating and sugar-addition experiments indicated that similar to oral microorganisms, interactions within intestinal bacteria and between intestinal and oral strains were mediated by lectin-carbohydrate interactions.
TI  - Interactions between salivary Bifidobacterium adolescentis and other oral bacteria: in vitro coaggregation and coadhesion assays.
AB  - Coaggregation assays were performed to investigate interactions between oral Bifidobacterium adolescentis and other oral bacterial species. Bifidobacterium adolescentis OLB6410 isolated from the saliva of healthy humans did not coaggregate with Actinomyces naeslundii JCM8350, Streptococcus mitis OLS3293, Streptococcus sanguinis JCM5708, Veillonella parvula ATCC17745 or Porphyromonas gingivalis OB7124, but it did coaggregate with Fusobacterium nucleatum JCM8532. Subsequent examination of biofilm formation on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite discs using FISH revealed that B. adolescentis OLB6410 could not directly adhere to the coated discs. It did, however, adhere to biofilms of A. naeslundii, V. parvula, and F. nucleatum, although it did not coaggregate with A. naeslundii nor with V. parvula. These results suggest that the adhesion of B. adolescentis to tooth surfaces is mediated by other oral bacteria. Heat- or proteinase K-treated F. nucleatum could not coaggregate with B. adolescentis. Similarly, the coaggregation and coadhesion of proteinase K-treated B. adolescentis were strongly inhibited. It is therefore probable that proteinaceous factors on the cellular surface of B. adolescentis and F. nucleatum are involved in their interaction. The data presented in this study add to our understanding of bifidobacterial colonization in the human oral cavity.
TI  - Bacteria recovered from dental pulp induce apoptosis of lymph node cells.
AB  - Apoptosis is critical in the pathogenesis of several infectious diseases. The induction of apoptosis was assessed in mouse lymph node cells by four bacteria recovered from infected human dental pulp: Gemella morbillorum, Clostridium butyricum, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Bifidobacterium adolescentis. Smaller lymph nodes and smaller numbers of cells were observed after experimental dental pulp infection with C. butyricum, suggesting that this bacterium induces cell death. Apoptosis was evaluated by determination of cell ploidy and detection of DNA degradation in cells cultured with killed bacteria. Paraformaldehyde-killed C. butyricum and heat-killed G. morbillorum induced substantial cell death, while F. nucleatum and B. adolescentis induced cell death at lower levels. No bacterial preparations induced apoptosis in cells from mice genetically deficient for tumour necrosis factor receptor p55 (TNFRp55), implicating this receptor directly or indirectly as a mediator in the process. It was concluded that apoptosis may be induced during periapical lesions of pulpal origin.
TI  - Cytokine production in response to endodontic infection in germ-free mice.
AB  - This study evaluated the cytokine profiles (type 1 or type 2) that are triggered  by and modulate endodontic periapical infections in the root canal system of germ-free mice. Microorganisms isolated from two patients with pulpal necrosis were inoculated into two groups of experimental animals: group I (Gemella morbillorum) and group II (Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Clostridium butyricum). In vitro, G. morbillorum induced type 1 cytokine synthesis, while the modulation processed in vivo seemed to have the opposite effect, with a reduction in the basal levels of IL-12 and IFN-gamma, IL-4-independent down-modulation. In vitro, microorganisms from group II, in poly-infection, induced a reduction of type 1 cytokine levels from day 10 to day 20, which seemed to be modulated via IL-4. In vivo, however, a predominance of the immune response to one species over the others occurred.
TI  - Implantation of bacteria from human pulpal necrosis and translocation from root canals in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine whether microorganisms recovered from infected human root canals were able to survive and translocate to a local lymph node when experimentally inoculated into the root canal system of germ-free mice. The microorganisms isolated from two patients with pulpal necrosis were inoculated in two groups of experimental animals; group I (Gemella morbillorum) and group II (Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Clostridium butyricum). G. morbillorum showed the highest frequency of colonization and translocation to the draining lymph node. In group II only F. nucleatum and C. butyricum colonized and translocated when inoculated in tri-association. When the bacteria from group II were inoculated in monoinfection all three species colonized the root canal of germ-free mice and translocated to the draining lymph node, but with different frequencies. We conclude that selective mechanisms occur in which some bacterial species are fit to survive, multiply, and translocate in the germ-free mouse model.
TI  - Biotransformation of 1-nitropyrene in intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Mutagenic nitroaromatic compounds have recently been found in photocopies, urban  atmosphere, automobile exhaust and wastewater. 1-Nitropyrene (1-NP) is readily formed when pyrene, ubiquitous in the environment, is exposed to nitrogen dioxide in the urban atmosphere or in automobile exhaust, and is highly mutagenic, inducing 449 his+ revertants/plate/nmol from Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 in the absence of S9 fraction in the Salmonella-microsome test. It is possible to swallow sputum or some food containing 1-NP and it would come into contact with the normal bacterial flora. We determined the 1-NP nitroreductase activity in environmental and laboratory bacterial strains. We found that the mutagenicity of 1-NP mixed with the feces of a healthy man or a culture of anaerobic bacteria was decreased. The product proved to be 1-aminopyrene (1-AP), based on its fluorescence spectrum, its mass spectrum, and its characteristic thin layer chromatographic and high performance liquid chromatographic patterns. The 1-NP nitroreductase activity of aerobic bacteria was low, but crude extracts from the anaerobic bacteria, i.e., Bacteroides fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus, Fusobacterium mortiferum, F. nucleatum, Clostridium perfringens, C. sporogenes, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, B. bifidum, Eubacterium lentum, E. limosum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, all easily converted 1-NP to 1-AP and proportionally decreased the mutagenic activity of 1-NP.
