TI  - Bacteria and yeast microbiota in milk kefir grains from different Italian regions.
AB  - Kefir grains are a unique symbiotic association of different microrganisms, mainly lactic acid bacteria, yeasts and occasionally acetic acid bacteria, cohabiting in a natural polysaccharide and a protein matrix. The microbial composition of kefir grains can be considered as extremely variable since it is strongly influenced by the geographical origin of the grains and by the sub-culturing method used. The aim of this study was to elucidate the bacteria and yeast species occurring in milk kefir grains collected in some Italian regions by combining the results of scanning electron microscopy analysis, viable counts on selective culture media, PCR-DGGE and pyrosequencing. The main bacterial species found was Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens while Dekkera anomala was the predominant yeast. The presence of sub-dominant species ascribed to Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis and Acetobacter genera was also highlighted. In addition, Lc. lactis, Enterococcus sp., Bacillus sp., Acetobacter fabarum, Acetobacter lovaniensis and Acetobacter orientalis were identified as part of the cultivable community. This work further confirms both the importance of combining culture-independent and culture-dependent approaches to study microbial diversity in food and how the combination of multiple 16S rRNA gene targets strengthens taxonomic identification using sequence-based identification approaches.
TI  - Effects of Ensiling Fermentation and Aerobic Deterioration on the Bacterial Community in Italian Ryegrass, Guinea Grass, and Whole-crop Maize Silages Stored at High Moisture Content.
AB  - The effects of storage period and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community were examined in Italian ryegrass (IR), guinea grass (GG), and whole-crop maize (WM) silages. Direct-cut forages were stored in a laboratory silo for 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 120 d without any additives; live counts, content of fermentation products, and characteristics of the bacterial community were determined. 2,3-Butanediol, acetic acid, and lactic acid were the dominant fermentation products in the IR, GG, and WM silages, respectively. The acetic acid content increased as a result of prolonged ensiling, regardless of the type of silage crop, and the changes were distinctively visible from the beginning of GG ensiling. Pantoea agglomerans, Rahnella aquatilis, and Enterobacter sp. were the major bacteria in the IR silage, indicating that alcoholic fermentation may be due to the activity of enterobacteria. Staphylococcus sciuri and Bacillus pumilus were detected when IR silage was spoiled, whereas between aerobically stable and unstable silages, no differences were seen in the bacterial community at silo opening. Lactococcus lactis was a representative bacterium, although acetic acid was the major fermentation product in the GG silage. Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, and Morganella morganii were suggested to be associated with the increase in acetic acid due to prolonged storage. Enterobacter cloacae appeared when the GG silage was spoiled. In the WM silage, no distinctive changes due to prolonged ensiling were seen in the bacterial community. Throughout the ensiling, Weissella paramesenteroides, Weissella confusa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were present in addition to L. plantarum, L. brevis, and L. lactis. Upon deterioration, Acetobacter pasteurianus, Klebsiella variicola, Enterobacter hormaechei, and Bacillus gibsonii were detected. These results demonstrate the diverse bacterial community that evolves during ensiling and aerobic spoilage of IR, GG, and WM silages.
TI  - Molecular identification of microbial community in surface and undersurface douchi during postfermentation.
AB  - To find the reason for fermentation failure of surface Douchi during postfermentation, the microbial communities in undersurface and surface samples were investigated using cell counting method and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The results showed that the microbial biomass in surface Douchi was obviously different from that in undersurface Douchi even sampled from the same fermentation tanks, and a 10- to 100-fold reduction of microbial cell counts in undersurface had been observed. The bacterial DGGE profile and principal component analysis (PCA) results indicated that only Lactococcus lacts subsp. lactis and Bacillus thermoamylovorans were detected from surface Douchi, while Lactococcus lacts subsp. lactis, Staphylococcus lentus and 2 uncultured strains occupied the dominant positions in undersurface Douchi; when amplified using Bacillus-specific primers, Bacillus thermoamylovorans, Bacillus subtilis, and Enterobacter sp. were found in undersurface Douchi, while only Bacillus thermoamylovorans were detected from surface Douchi; compared to the bacteria and Bacillus, the DGGE profiles and PCA plot of fungi indicated that the fungal community between surface and undersurface Douchi was similar and mainly composed by yeasts. In this study, we detected the microbial biomass and species in postfermentation stage of Douchi, and the various microbial diversity in undersurface and surface samples might be the cause of the fermentation failure in surface fermentation tanks.
TI  - Effect of signal peptides on the secretion of beta-cyclodextrin glucanotransferase in Lactococcus lactis NZ9000.
AB  - Cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (CGTase) is an extracellular enzyme which catalyzes the formation of cyclodextrin from starch. The production of CGTase using lactic acid bacterium is an attractive alternative and safer strategy to produce CGTase. In this study, we report the construction of genetically modified Lactococcus lactis strains harboring plasmids that secrete the Bacillus sp. G1 beta-CGTase, with the aid of the signal peptides (SPs) SPK1, USP45 and native SP (NSP). Three constructed vectors, pNZ:NSP:CGT, pNZ:USP:CGT and pNZ:SPK1:CGT, were developed in this study. Each vector harbored a different SP fused to the CGTase. The formation of halo zones on starch plates indicated the production and secretion of beta-CGTase by the recombinants. The expression of this enzyme is shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and zymogram analysis. A band size of approximately 75 kDa corresponding to beta-CGTase is identified in the intracellular and the extracellular environments of the host after medium modification. The replacement of glucose by starch in the medium was shown to induce beta-CGTase production in L. lactis. Although beta-CGTase production is comparatively low in NZ:SPK1:CGT, the SP SPK1 was shown to have higher secretion efficiency compared to the other SPs used in this study.
TI  - Isolation of a bacteriocin-producing lactococcus lactis and application of its bacteriocin to manage spoilage bacteria in high-value marine fish under different storage temperatures.
AB  - The bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria have considerable potential for biopreservation. The Lactococcus lactis strain PSY2 (GenBank account no. JF703669) isolated from the surface of marine perch Perca flavescens produced antibacterial activity against pathogenic and spoilage-causing Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria viz. Arthrobacter sp., Acinetobacter sp., Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus and possessed broad inhibitory spectrum. The biopreservative efficacy of the bacteriocin PSY2 was evaluated using fillets of reef cod, Epinephelus diacanthus. The fillets (10 g) were sprayed with 2.0 ml of 1,600 AU/ml bacteriocin, wrapped and kept under different storage temperatures viz., 4, 0 and -18 degrees C. The biopreservative extended the shelf-life of fillets stored at 4 degrees C to >21 days as against <14 days observed in the untreated samples. The total count of spoilage bacteria was reduced by 2.5 logarithmic units in the treated sample during the 14th day of storage as against the control. Chemical analysis revealed a significant change (P < 0.05) in the pH value, free fatty acid (as % oleic acid), total volatile base nitrogen and total methyl amine content in the treated samples. The overall acceptability in terms of sensory attributes was significantly higher in the bacteriocin-treated samples stored for 21 days at 4 degrees C while the untreated samples became unacceptable by the 14th day. The biopreservative gave no significant effect at -18 degrees C. Thus, the bacteriocin derived from L. lactis PSY2 gave increased protection against spoilage bacteria and offers an alternative for the preservation of high-value sea foods.
TI  - Production of the Bacillus licheniformis SubC protease using Lactococcus lactis NICE expression system.
AB  - In this work the subC gene from Bacillus licheniformis encoding subtilisin was cloned into the nisin-controlled expression (NICE) vectors (pNZ8048 and pNZ8148) with or without the signal peptide SP Usp45 directing extracellular secretion via Sec machinery. Extracellular protease production and activity was tested using Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 as host, which could be used for rennet production. The efficiency of protein production was tested using purified nisin and the supernatant of L. lactis NZ970 nisin producer. Similar results were obtained for 1 ng/ml nisin and 10 000 diluted supernatant. SP Usp45 signal peptide effectively directed extracellular localization of active and stable protease. SubC signal for extracellular localization in B. licheniformis, was also recognized by L. lactis Sec pathway, although with lower efficiency, as shown by a 3-fold lower protease activity in the medium. Protease production and activity was optimized using parameters such as induction time, nutrients (glucose, casitone) supplementation during growth or protease stabilization by calcium ions. The results were also verified in fed-batch bioreactor for further scale-up of the expression system.
TI  - Potential application of the nisin Z preparation of Lactococcus lactis W8 in preservation of milk.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the preparation of nisin Z from Lactococcus lactis W8-fermented milk in controlling the growth of spoilage bacteria in pasteurized milk. METHODS AND RESULTS: Spoilage bacteria isolated from pasteurized milk at 8 and 15 degrees C were identified as Enterococcus italicus, Enterococcus mundtii, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus cereus, Lactobacillus paracasei, Acinetobacter sp., Pseudomonas fluorescens and Enterobacter aerogenes. These bacteria were found to have the ability to survive pasteurization temperature. Except Enterobacter aerogenes, the spoilage bacteria were sensitive to the nisin Z preparation of the L. lactis W8. Addition of the nisin Z preparation to either the skim milk or fat milk inoculated with each of the spoilage bacteria reduced the initial counts (about 5 log CFU ml(-)(1)) to an undetectable level within 8-20 h. The nisin Z preparation extended the shelf life of milk to 2 months under refrigeration. CONCLUSIONS: The nisin Z preparation from L. lactis W8-fermented milk was found to be effective as a backup preservative to counteract postpasteurization contamination in milk. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: A rapid inhibition of spoilage bacteria in pasteurized skim and fat milk with the nisin Z preparation of L. lactis W8 is more significant in comparison with the commercially available nisin (nisin A). The nisin Z preparation can be used instead of commercial nisin, which is not effective in fat milk.
TI  - Extracellular expression of a functional recombinant Ganoderma lucidium immunomodulatory protein by Bacillus subtilis and Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - Bacillus subtilis and Lactococcus lactis are ideal hosts for the production of extracellular heterologous proteins of major commercial importance. A recombinant gene for the novel Ganoderma lucidium immunomodulatory protein LZ-8, recombinant LZ-8, was designed encoding the same amino acid sequence but using the preferred codons for both strains and was synthesized by overlapping extension PCR. Using the signal peptide (SP) from subtilisin YaB (SP(YaB)), recombinant LZ-8 was expressed extracellularly in Bacillus subtilis and Lactococcus lactis. In the absence of SP(YaB), recombinant LZ-8 was expressed extracellularly in B. subtilis, but not in L. lactis. The three expressed recombinant LZ-8s showed different capacities for modulating the production of Th1 and Th2 cytokines by peripheral blood mononuclear cells and of tumor necrosis factor alpha by a macrophage cell line.
TI  - Lactococcus lactis, an efficient cell factory for recombinant protein production  and secretion.
AB  - The use of Gram-positive bacteria for heterologous protein production proves to be a useful choice due to easy protein secretion and purification. The lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis emerges as an attractive alternative to the Gram-positive model Bacillus subtilis. Here, we review recent work on the expression and secretion systems available for heterologous protein secretion in L. lactis, including promoters, signal peptides and mutant host strains known to overcome some bottlenecks of the process. Among the tools developed in our laboratory, inactivation of HtrA, the unique housekeeping protease at the cell surface, or complementation of the Sec machinery with B. subtilis SecDF accessory protein each result in the increase in heterologous protein yield. Furthermore, our lactococcal expression/secretion system, using both P(Zn)zitR, an expression cassette tightly controlled by environmental zinc, and a consensus signal peptide, SP(Exp4), allows efficient production and secretion of the staphylococcal nuclease, as evidenced by protein yields (protein amount/biomass) comparable to those obtained using NICE or P170 expression systems under similar laboratory conditions. Finally, the toolbox we are developing should contribute to enlarge the use of L. lactis as a protein cell factory.
TI  - Secretory expression of a heterologous nattokinase in Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - Nattokinase has been reported as an oral health product for the prevention of atherosclerosis. We developed a novel strategy to express a nattokinase from Bacillus subtilis in a live delivery vehicle, Lactococcus lactis. Promoter P( nisZ) and signal peptide SP(Usp) were used for inducible and secretory expression of nattokinase in L. lactis. Western blotting analysis demonstrated that nattokinase was successfully expressed, and about 94% of the enzyme was secreted to the culture. The recombinant nattokinase showed potent fibrinolytic activity, equivalent to 41.7 urokinase units per milliliter culture. Expression and delivery of such a fibrinolytic enzyme in the food-grade vehicle L. lactis would facilitate the widespread application of nattokinase in the control and prevention of thrombosis diseases.
TI  - Construction and characterization of nisin-controlled expression vectors for use  in Lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  - The Nisin-controlled gene expression (NICE) system, which was discovered in Lactococcus lactis, was adapted to Lactobacillus reuteri by ligating nisA promoter (PnisA) and nisRK DNA fragments into the Escherichia coli-Lb. reuteri shuttle vector pSTE32. This chimerical plasmid (pNICE) was capable of expressing the heterologous amylase gene (amyL) under nisin induction. Optimization of induction factors for this Lb. reuteri/pNICE system, including nisin concentration (viz. 50 ng/ml), growth phase of culture at which nisin be added (viz. at the early exponential phase), and the best time for analyzing the gene product after inoculation (viz. at the 3rd h), allowed the amylase product to be expressed in high amounts, constituting up to about 18% of the total intracellular protein. Furthermore, the signal peptide (SP) of amyL gene (SPamyL) from Bacillus licheniformis was ligated to the downstream of PnisA in pNICE, upgrading this vector to a NICE-secretion (NIES) level, which was then designated pNIES (Sec+, secretion positive). Characterization of pNIES using an amyL-SPDelta gene (amyL gene lacking its SP) as a reporter revealed the 3rd h after induction as the secretion peak of this system, at which the secretion efficiency and the amount of alpha-amylase being secreted into the culture supernatant were estimated to reach 77.6% and 27.75 mg/l. Expression and secretion of AmyL products by pNIES in Lb. reuteri was also confirmed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analysis.
TI  - High-level resistance to oxidative stress in Lactococcus lactis conferred by Bacillus subtilis catalase KatE.
AB  - Lactococcus lactis, a lactic acid bacterium widely used for food fermentations, is often exposed to damaging stress conditions. In particular, oxidative stress leads to DNA, protein and membrane damages that can be lethal. As L. lactis has no catalase, the impact of production of the Bacillus subtilis haem catalase KatE on its oxidative stress resistance was tested. This cytoplasmic catalase was engineered for extracellular expression in L. lactis with an optimization strategy based on fusion to the nisin-inducible promoter and a lactococcal signal peptide (SP(Usp45)). The production of KatE by L. lactis conferred an 800-fold increase in survival after 1 h exposure to 4 mM hydrogen peroxide, and a 160-fold greater survival in long-term (3 days) survival of aerated cultures in a cydA mutant, which is unable to respire. The presence of KatE protected DNA from oxidative damage and limited its degradation after long-term aeration in a cydA/recA mutant, defective in DNA repair. L. lactis is thus able to produce active catalase that can provide efficient antioxidant activity.
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis induces inflammatory bowel disease in interleukin-10 knockout mice.
AB  - Germ-free interleukin-10 knockout (IL-10 KO) mice developed inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) after they were colonized with a pure culture of Enterococcus faecalis. E. faecalis not only induced IBD (primarily in colon and rectum) but rectal dysplasia and adenocarcinoma was also found in the IL-10 KO mice. Conventional (complex-intestinal flora) IL-10 KO mice developed IBD within 10 to 15 weeks of age and showed more pathology in the cecum (typhlitis) than we observed with E. faecalis-induced IBD in gnotobiotic IL-10 KO mice. Conversely, neither germ-free IL-10 mice nor IL-10 KO mice colonized as adults, with a pure culture of Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus casei, L. reuteri, L. acidophilus, a Bifidobacterium sp., Lactococcus lactis, or a Bacillus sp. developed IBD during the 25- to 30-week study. E. faecalis is a common intestinal microbe of man and animals that can trigger IBD, dysplasia, and carcinoma in a genetically susceptible murine host.
TI  - Formation of biogenic amines in raw milk Hispanico cheese manufactured with proteinases and different levels of starter culture.
AB  - Two proteinases, a neutral proteinase from Bacillus subtilis and a cysteine proteinase from Micrococcus sp., were used to accelerate the ripening process of raw cow's milk Hispanico cheese, a semihard variety. Two levels (0.1% and 1%) of a commercial starter culture containing Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and L. lactis subsp. cremoris were added for cheese manufacture. The influence of both factors, proteinase addition and level of starter culture, on the growth of amino acid-decarboxylating microorganisms and on the formation of biogenic amines during cheese ripening was investigated in duplicate experiments. The population of tyrosine decarboxylase-positive bacteria, which represented less than 1% of the total bacterial population in most cheese samples, and tyrosine decarboxylase-positive lactobacilli was not influenced by proteinase addition or level of starter culture. Tyramine was detected in all batches of cheese from day 30. Its concentration was significantly (P < 0.05) influenced by proteinase addition but not by the level of starter culture and increased with cheese age. After 90 days of ripening, 103 to 191 mg/kg of tyramine was found in the different cheese batches. Histamine was not detected until day 60 in cheese with neutral proteinase and 1% starter culture and until day 90 in the rest of the cheeses. The concentration of this amine did not exceed 20 mg/kg in any of the batches investigated. Phenylethylamine and tryptamine were not found in any of the samples.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of the lactococcal plasmid-encoded type II restriction/modification system, LlaDII.
AB  - The LlaDII restriction/modification (R/M) system was found on the naturally occurring 8.9-kb plasmid pHW393 in Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris W39. A 2.4-kb PstI-EcoRI fragment inserted into the Escherichia coli-L. lactis shuttle vector pCI3340 conferred to L. lactis LM2301 and L. lactis SMQ86 resistance against representatives of the three most common lactococcal phage species: 936, P335, and c2. The LlaDII endonuclease was partially purified and found to recognize and cleave the sequence 5'-GC decreases NGC-3', where the arrow indicates the cleavage site. It is thus an isoschizomer of the commercially available restriction endonuclease Fnu4HI. Sequencing of the 2.4-kb PstI-EcoRI fragment revealed two open reading frames arranged tandemly and separated by a 105-bp intergenic region. The endonuclease gene of 543 bp preceded the methylase gene of 954 bp. The deduced amino acid sequence of the LlaDII R/M system showed high homology to that of its only sequenced isoschizomer, Bsp6I from Bacillus sp. strain RFL6, with 41% identity between the endonucleases and 60% identity between the methylases. The genetic organizations of the LlaDII and Bsp6I R/M systems are identical. Both methylases have two recognition sites (5'-GCGGC-3' and 5'-GCCGC-3') forming a putative stemloop structure spanning part of the presumed -35 sequence and part of the intervening region between the -35 and -10 sequences. Alignment of the LlaDII and Bsp6I methylases with other m5C methylases showed that the protein primary structures possessed the same organization.
TI  - Structure-function relationships within the peptide deformylase family. Evidence  for a conserved architecture of the active site involving three conserved motifs and a metal ion.
AB  - Thermus thermophilus peptide deformylase was characterized. Its enzymatic properties as well as its organization in domains proved to share close resemblances with those of the Escherichia coli enzyme despite few sequence identities. In addition to the HEXXH signature sequence of the zinc metalloprotease family, a second short stretch of strictly conserved amino acids was noticed, EGCLS, the cysteine of which corresponds to the third zinc ligand. The study of site-directed mutants of the E. coli deformylase shows that the residues of this stretch are crucial for the structure and/or catalytic efficiency of the active enzyme. Both aforementioned sequences were used as markers of the peptide deformylase family in protein sequence databases. Seven sequences coming from Haemophilus influenzae, Lactococcus lactis, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Bacillus subtilus and Synechocystis sp. could be identified. The characterization of the product of the open reading frame from B. stearothermophilus confirmed that it actually corresponded to a peptide deformylase with properties similar to those of the E. coli enzyme. Alignment of the nine peptide deformylase sequences showed that, in addition to the two above sequences, only a third one, GXGXAAXQ, is strictly conserved. This motif is also located in the active site according to the three-dimensional structure of the E. coli enzyme. Site-directed variants of E. coli peptide deformylase showed the involvement of the corresponding residues for maintaining an active and stable enzyme. Altogether, these data allow us to propose that the three identified conserved motifs of peptide deformylases build up the active site around a metal ion. Finally, an analysis of the location of the other conserved residues, in particular of the hydrophobic ones, was performed using the three-dimensional model of the E. coli enzyme. This enables us to suggest that all bacterial peptide deformylases adopt a constant overall tertiary structure.
TI  - In vitro fructooligosaccharide utilization and inhibition of Salmonella spp. by selected bacteria.
AB  - In vitro experiments were conducted to determine: 1) inhibitory capacities of potential direct-fed microbial bacteria against Salmonella serotypes; and 2) the ability of Bifidobacterium bifidum, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus casei, Lactococcus lactis, Pediococcus sp., and Salmonella spp. to grow in media containing fructooligosaccharides (FOS-50 or FOS pure formulation) as the only carbohydrate source. Thirteen bacteria (two strains of Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus subtilis, B. bifidum, E. faecium, two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. casei, Pediococcus sp., Propionibacterium acidopropionici, P. jensenii, and Propionibacterium sp.) were tested for inhibition of six Salmonella serotypes (S. california, S. enteritidis, S. heidelberg, S. mission, S. senftenberg, and S. typhimurium) using a spot-the-lawn technique. Bifidobacterium bifidum, E. faecium, all lactobacilli, and Pediococcus sp. clearly inhibited growth of all Salmonella serotypes. In the growth experiments, E. faecium, L. lactis, and Pediococcus sp. grew in media with either FOS-50 or the pure formulation of FOS as the sole carbohydrate source. All tested Salmonella serotypes utilized FOS-50 for growth; however growth varied among the serotypes. In contrast, none of the Salmonella serotypes grew in media containing the pure formulation of FOS as the only carbohydrate source.
