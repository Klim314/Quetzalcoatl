TI  == [determination of minimal concentrations of biocorrosion inhibitors by a bioluminescence method in relation to bacteria, participating in biocorrosion].
AB  == by using a bioluminescence atp assay, we have determined the minimal concentrations of some biocorrosion inhibitors (katon, khazar, vfiks-82, nitro-1, kaspii-2, and kaspii-4) suppressing most common microbial corrosion agents: desulfovibrio desulfuricans, desulfovibrio vulgaris, pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas fluorescens, and acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. the cell titers determined by the bioluminescence method, including not only dividing cells but also their dormant living counterparts, are two- to sixfold greater than the values determined microbiologically. it is shown that the bioluminescence method  can be applied to determination of cell titers in samples of oil-field waters in  the presence of iron ions (up to 260 mm) and iron sulfide (to 186 mg/l) and in the absence or presence of biocidal corrosion inhibitors.

TI  == evidence for the bacterial origin of genes encoding fermentation enzymes of the amitochondriate protozoan parasite entamoeba histolytica.
AB  == entamoeba histolytica is an amitochondriate protozoan parasite with numerous bacterium-like fermentation enzymes including the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (por), ferredoxin (fd), and alcohol dehydrogenase e (adhe). the goal of this study was to determine whether the genes encoding these cytosolic e. histolytica fermentation enzymes might derive from a bacterium by horizontal transfer, as has previously been suggested for e. histolytica genes encoding heat shock protein 60, nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase, and superoxide dismutase. in this study, the e. histolytica por gene and the adhe gene of a second amitochondriate protozoan parasite, giardia lamblia, were sequenced, and their phylogenetic positions were estimated in relation to por, adhe, and fd cloned from eukaryotic and eubacterial organisms. the e. histolytica por gene encodes a 1,620-amino-acid peptide that contained conserved iron-sulfur- and thiamine pyrophosphate-binding sites. the predicted e. histolytica por showed fewer positional identities to the por of g. lamblia (34%) than to the por of the enterobacterium klebsiella pneumoniae (49%), the cyanobacterium anabaena sp. (44%), and the protozoan trichomonas vaginalis (46%), which targets its por to anaerobic organelles called hydrogenosomes. maximum-likelihood, neighbor-joining, and parsimony analyses also suggested as less likely e. histolytica por sharing more recent common ancestry with g. lamblia por than with por of bacteria and the t. vaginalis hydrogenosome. the g. lamblia adhe encodes an 888-amino-acid fusion  peptide with an aldehyde dehydrogenase at its amino half and an iron-dependent (class 3) adh at its carboxy half. the predicted g. lamblia adhe showed extensive positional identities to adhe of escherichia coli (49%), clostridium acetobutylicum (44%), and e. histolytica (43%) and lesser identities to the class 3 adh of eubacteria and yeast (19 to 36%). phylogenetic analyses inferred a closer relationship of the e. histolytica adhe to bacterial adhe than to the g. lamblia adhe. the 6-kda fd of e. histolytica and g. lamblia were most similar to  those of the archaebacterium methanosarcina barkeri and the delta-purple bacterium desulfovibrio desulfuricans, respectively, while the 12-kda fd of the t. vaginalis hydrogenosome was most similar to the 12-kda fd of gamma-purple bacterium pseudomonas putida. e. histolytica genes (and probably g. lamblia genes) encoding fermentation enzymes therefore likely derive from bacteria by horizontal transfer, although it is not clear from which bacteria these amebic genes derive. these are the first nonorganellar fermentation enzymes of eukaryotes implicated to have derived from bacteria.

TI  == methylmercury resistance in desulfovibrio desulfuricans strains in relation to methylmercury degradation.
AB  == two strains of desulfovibrio desulfuricans, one known to synthesize monomethylmercury from ionic mercury, were grown to determine methylmercury toxicity and for comparison with an anaerobic strain of clostridium pasteurianum, a h(2) producer, and with the broad-spectrum mercury-resistant pseudomonas putida strain fb-1, capable of degrading 1 mug of methylmercury to methane and elemental mercury in 2 h. the ch(3)hgcl resistance of d. desulfuricans strains was 10 times that of p. putida fb-1 and 100 times that of c. pasteurianum. the methylmercury resistance of d. desulfuricans was related to the disappearance of methylmercury  from cultures by transformation to dimethylmercury, metacinnabar, methane, and traces of ionic mercury. during a 15-day experiment the kinetics of the two volatile compounds dimethylmercury [(ch(3))(2)hg] and methane were monitored in the liquid by a specific new technique with purge-and-trap gas chromatography in  line with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and in the headspace by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection. insoluble metacinnabar (cubic hgs) of biological origin was detected by x-ray diffractometry in the gray precipitate from the insoluble residue of the pellet of a 1-liter culture spiked  with 100 mg of ch(3)hgcl. this was compared with a 1-liter culture of d. desulfuricans ls spiked with 100 mg of hgcl(2). in a further experiment, it was demonstrated that insoluble, decomposable, white dimethylmercury sulfide [(ch(3)hg)(2)s] formed instantly in the reaction of methylmercury with hydrogen sulfide. this organomercurial was extracted with chloroform and identified by gas chromatography in line with mass spectrometry. the d. desulfuricans strains were  resistant to high concentrations of methylmercury because they produced insoluble dimethylmercury sulfide, which slowly decomposed under anaerobic conditions to metacinnabar and volatilized to dimethylmercury and methane between phs 6.2 and 6.5 for high (4.5-g . liter) or low (0.09-g . liter) sulfate contents. methane was produced from ch(3)hgcl at a lower rate than by the broad-spectrum hg-resistant p. putida strain fb-1.
