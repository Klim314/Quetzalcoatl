TI  == microbiological quality of indoor air in university libraries.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the concentration of bacteria and fungi in the indoor environment of jimma university libraries, so as to estimate the health hazard and to create standards for indoor air quality control. methods: the microbial quality of indoor air of eight libraries of jimma university was determined. the  settle plate method using open petri-dishes containing different culture media was employed to collect sample twice daily. isolates were identified according to standard methods. results: the concentrations of bacteria and fungi aerosols in the indoor environment of the university libraries ranged between 367-2595 cfu/m(3). according to the sanitary standards classification of european commission, almost all the libraries indoor air of jimma university was heavily contaminated with bacteria and fungi. in spite of their major source difference,  the average fungi density found in the indoor air of libraries did appear to follow the same trend with bacterial density (p=0.001). the bacteria isolates included micrococcus sp., staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus sp. and neisseria sp. while cladosporium sp., alternaria sp., penicillium sp. and aspergillus sp. were the most isolated fungi. conclusions: the indoor air of all  libraries were in the range above highly contaminated according to european commission classification and the most isolates are considered as potential candidates involved in the establishment of sick building syndromes and often associated with clinical manifestations like allergy, rhinitis, asthma and conjunctivitis. thus, attention must be given to control those environmental factors which favor the growth and multiplication of microbes in indoor environment of libraries to safeguard the health of users and workers.

TI  == synthetic phytochelatin surface display in cupriavidus metallidurans ch34 for enhanced metals bioremediation.
AB  == this work describes the effects of the cell surface display of a synthetic phytochelatin in the highly metal tolerant bacterium cupriavidus metallidurans ch34. the ec20sp synthetic phytochelatin gene was fused between the coding sequences of the signal peptide (ss) and of the autotransporter beta-domain of the neisseria gonorrhoeae iga protease precursor (igabeta), which successfully targeted the hybrid protein toward the c. metallidurans outer membrane. the expression of the ss-ec20sp-igabeta gene fusion was driven by a modified version  of the bacillus subtilis mrga promoter showing high level basal gene expression that is further enhanced by metal presence in c. metallidurans. the recombinant strain showed increased ability to immobilize pb(2+), zn(2+), cu(2+), cd(2+), mn(2+), and ni(2+) ions from the external medium when compared to the control strain. to ensure plasmid stability and biological containment, the mob region of the plasmid was replaced by the e. coli hok/sok coding sequence.

TI  == adrenal gland hemorrhage in patients with fatal bacterial infections.
AB  == a wide spectrum of adrenal gland pathology is seen during bacterial infections. hemorrhage is particularly associated with meningococcemia, while abscesses have  been described with several neonatal infections. we studied adrenal gland histopathology of 65 patients with bacterial infections documented in a variety of tissues by using immunohistochemistry. the infections diagnosed included neisseria meningitidies, group a streptococcus, rickettsia rickettsii, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, ehrlichia sp., bacillus anthracis, leptospira sp., clostridium sp., klebsiella sp., legionella sp., yersinia pestis, and treponema pallidum. bacteria were detected in the adrenal of 40 (61%) cases. adrenal hemorrhage was present in 39 (60%) cases. bacteria or bacterial antigens were observed in 31 (79%) of the cases with adrenal hemorrhage including 14 with n. meningitidis, four with r. rickettsii, four with s. pneumoniae, three with group a streptococcus, two with s. aureus, two with b. anthracis, one with t. pallidum, and one with legionella sp. bacterial antigens were observed in nine of 26 non-hemorrhagic adrenal glands that showed inflammatory foci (four cases), edema (two cases), congestion (two cases), or necrosis (one case). hemorrhage is the most frequent adrenal gland pathology observed in fatal bacterial infections. bacteria and bacterial antigens are frequently seen in adrenal glands with hemorrhage and may play a pathogenic role. although n. meningitidis is the most frequent bacteria associated with adrenal gland pathology, a broad collection of bacteria can also cause adrenal lesions.

TI  == differential identification of bacillus anthracis from environmental bacillus species using microarray analysis.
AB  == aims: to determine whether microarray analysis could be employed for the differential identification of a range of environmental bacillus sp. from four strains of bacillus anthracis. methods and results: oligonucleotide probes were designed that were specific to virulence factor genes of b. anthracis (pag, lef and cap), the variable number tandem repeat region of the b. anthracis vrra gene  and to the 16s-23s rrna intergenic transcribed spacer region (its) and pleiotropic regulator (plcr) regions of the bacillus cereus subgroup species. generic probes were also designed to hybridize with conserved regions of the 16s  rrna genes of bacillus (as a positive control), neisseria sp., pseudomonas sp., streptococcus sp., mycobacterium sp. and to all members of the enterobacteriaceae to allow simultaneous detection of these bacteria. identification of b. anthracis was found to rely entirely on hybridization of dna specific to regions of the pag, lef and cap genes. cross-reaction was observed between b. anthracis and other bacillus species with all the other bacillus probes tested. results obtained using microarray hybridizations were confirmed using conventional microbiological techniques and found to have very high comparability. conclusions: microarray-based assays are an effective method for the identification of b. anthracis from mixed-culture environmental samples without problems of false-positivity that have been observed with conventional pcr assays. significance and impact of the study: identification of environmental bacillus sp. by conventional pcr is prone to potential for reporting false-positives. this study provides a method for the exclusion of such isolates.

TI  == beta-lactamase production and antimicrobial susceptibility of subgingival bacteria from refractory periodontitis.
AB  == this study assessed the extent of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in subgingival plaque samples obtained from 25 patients with refractory marginal periodontitis in the usa. beta-lactamase-positive isolates were characterized using commercial diagnostic kits and partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene. the susceptibilities to different antimicrobial agents were tested and, in addition,  the isolates were screened for the presence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases  (esbls). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were detected in 18 (72%) patients. the most prominent beta-lactamase-producing organisms belonged to the anaerobic genus prevotella. other enzyme-producing anaerobic strains were fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes and peptostreptococcus sp. facultative bacteria, such as burkholderia spp., ralstonia pickettii, capnocytophaga spp., bacillus spp., staphylococcus spp. and neisseria sp., were also detected among the enzyme-producers. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ampicillin and  amoxicillin were in the range 1.5-256 micrograms/ml and 4-256 micrograms/ml, respectively, for the isolates of the prevotella species. all prevotella isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate and metronidazole, but they showed variable resistance to tetracyclines. two of the prevotella isolates had high mics of cefotaxime and ceftazidime. esbl activity was not detected in any of the  beta-lactamase-producing isolates by the etest method. thus, our study demonstrated a wide variety of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria that may play a  role in refractory periodontal disease.

TI  == detection of bacterial dna in latin american patients with reactive arthritis by  polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analysis.
AB  == objective: bacteria and/or their antigens are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of reactive arthritis (rea). polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using the 16s ribosomal rna-pcr method was used to identify bacterial dna in synovial fluid (sf) and tissue (st) in a well defined group of patients with chronic rea.  in addition, species found were identified by means of sequence analysis. methods: we examined 15 st and 5 sf samples of 15 patients with rea, 5 st samples of 5 patients with osteoarthritis (oa), and 8 sf from 8 patients with closed traumatic knee injuries using a nested pcr with universal 16s rrna primers. in addition, a nested pcr was developed to detect dna sequences of salmonella sp. and mycoplasma sp. automated sequencing and comparative data analysis (genbank) were also performed to identify the species. results: bacterial dna was identified in 8 cases, 5 st and 3 sf; chlamydia trachomatis (n = 2), pseudomonas  sp. (n = 3), and bacillus cereus (n = 2) were the most common microorganisms identified. a variety of microorganisms including clostridium sp., lactobacillus  sp., pseudomonas migulae, p. fluorescens, and p. putida, and neisseria meningitidis serogroup b were also identified. in half of the cases (4/8) 2 to 3  bacterial antigens were identified simultaneously. conclusion: bacterial dna is present in the joints in patients with chronic rea. a wide spectrum of bacteria including some not previously associated with rea were identified. further studies are needed to establish their exact role in the pathogenesis of rea and related arthritides.

TI  == comparative genomics and evolution of genes encoding bacterial (p)ppgpp synthetases/hydrolases (the rel, rela and spot proteins).
AB  == in the gram-negative model organism escherichia coli, the effector molecule of the stringent response, (p)ppgpp, is synthesized by two different enzymes, rela and spot, whereas in the gram-positive model organism bacillus subtilis only one  enzyme named rel is responsible for this activity. rel and spot also possess (p)ppgpp hydrolase activity. blast searches were used to identify orthologous genes in databases. the construction and bootstrapping of phylogenetic trees allowed classification of these orthologs. four groups could be distinguished: with the exception of neisseria and bordetella (beta subdivision), the rela and spot groups are exclusively found in the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria. two rel groups representing the actinobacterial and the bacillus/clostridium group were also identified. the spot proteins are related to the gram positive rel proteins. rela proteins carry substitutions in the hd domain (aravind and koonin, 1998, tibs 23: 469-472) responsible for ppgpp degradation. a theory for the evolution of the specialized, paralogous rela and spot genes is presented: after  gene duplication of an ancestral rellike gene, the spot and rela genes evolved from the duplicated genes. the distribution pattern of the paralogous rela and spot proteins supports a new model of linear bacterial evolution (gupta, 2000, fems microbiol. rev. 24: 367-402). this model postulates that the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria represents the most recently evolved bacterial lineage. however, two paralogous, closely related genes of porphyromonas gingivalis (cytophaga-flavobacterium-bacteroides phylum) encoding proteins with functions probably identical to the rela and spot proteins do not fit in this model. completely sequenced genomes of several obligately parasitic organisms (treponema pallidum, chlamydia species, rickettsia prowazekii) and the obligate aphid symbiont buchnera sp. aps as well as archaea do not contain rel-like genes  but they are present in the arabidopsis genome. in crosslinking experiments using different analogs of ppgpp as crosslinking reagents and rna polymerase preparations of escherichia coli, binding of ppgpp to distinct regions at the c-terminus of the beta subunit (the rpob gene product) and/or at the n-terminus of the beta subunit (the rpoc gene product) was observed previously. rpob and rpoc sequences of the species which do not possess a rel like gene do not exhibit specific insertions or deletions in the ppgpp binding regions.

TI  == natural transformation in mesophilic and thermophilic bacteria: identification and characterization of novel, closely related competence genes in acinetobacter  sp. strain bd413 and thermus thermophilus hb27.
AB  == the mesophile acinetobacter sp. strain bd413 and the extreme thermophile thermus  thermophilus hb27 display high frequencies of natural transformation. in this study we identified and characterized a novel competence gene in acinetobacter sp. strain bd413, coma, whose product displays significant similarities to the competence proteins coma and comec in neisseria and bacillus species. transcription of coma correlated with growth phase-dependent transcriptional regulation of the recently identified pilin-like factors of the transformation machinery. this finding strongly suggests that coma is part of a competence regulon. examination of the genome sequence of t. thermophilus hb27 led to detection of a coma/comec-like open reading frame (orf) which is flanked by an orf whose product shows significant similarities to the bacillus subtilis competence protein comea. to examine whether these two orfs, designated comec and comea, are implicated in natural transformation of t. thermophilus hb27, both were disrupted by using a thermostable kanamycin resistance marker. natural transformation in comec mutants was reduced 1,000-fold, whereas in comea mutants  the natural transformation phenotype was completely eliminated. these results strongly suggest that both genes, comec and comea, are required for natural transformation in t. thermophilus hb27. several transmembrane alpha-helices are predicted based on the amino acid sequences of coma in acinetobacter sp. strain bd413 and comec in t. thermophilus hb27, which suggests that coma and comec are located in the inner membrane and function in dna transport through the cytoplasmic membrane.

TI  == 16s rdna-based identification of bacteria from conjunctival swabs by pcr and dgge fingerprinting.
AB  == purpose: establishment of a new molecular biology technique for the identification of multiple bacteria from the ocular environment, which can be applied supplementarily to cultivation in cases of severe bacterial infections. methods: from 60 human conjunctivae (29 with purulent and 31 with nonpurulent conjunctivitis), swabs were taken and dna was extracted. fragments of 200 bp, spanning the v3 region of the eubacterial 16s rdna, were amplified by polymerase  chain reaction (pcr) and separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). for phylogenetic identification, dgge bands were excised and directly sequenced, or 16s rdna clone libraries were constructed and clones were screened  by dgge. sequences were compared with sequences of known bacteria listed in the embl database. furthermore, the results were compared with results obtained from  conventional cultivation. results: 16s rdna could be amplified from 25 of 29 investigated swabs taken from purulent conjunctivitis eyes and from 2 of 31 investigated swabs taken from nonpurulent conjunctivitis eyes. sixteen samples showed monomicrobial and 11 samples showed polymicrobial infections. the following genera (n is number of samples) were detected: staphylococcus (n = 8),  corynebacterium (n = 7), propionibacterium (n = 7), streptococcus (n = 6), bacillus (n = 2), acinetobacter (n = 3), pseudomonas (n = 3), proteus (n = 1), and brevundimonas (n = 1). four sequences could not be identified to the genus level. they had highest sequence similarities both to sequences of pantoea and enterobacter (n = 1), kingella and neisseria (n = 1), serratia and aranicola (n = 1), and leuconostoc and weissella (n = 2), respectively. culture was only positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 9), corynebacteria (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), streptococcus sp. (n = 1), proteus sp. (n = 1), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1). in total, 45% of  the 60 analyzed conjunctival swabs were pcr positive, whereas only 22% were culture positive. no sample positive by culture gave negative results by pcr. conclusions: 16s rdna sequence analyses and dgge fingerprinting are appropriate methods for the detection and identification of monomicrobial as well as polymicrobial ocular infections of bacteria that might not be detected by conventional cultivation.

TI  == production and characterization of a new monoclonal antibody against neisseria meningitidis: study of the cross-reactivity with different bacterial genera.
AB  == we have generated a hybridoma cell line which produces an 8c7br1 clone of the igm antibody isotype. it recognizes the 50-, 65-, and 60-kda antigens and is reactive with strains of n. meningitidis in the 98% of local neisseria genera by dot-elisa assays. two percent of the strains of n. meningitidis b do not present reactivity with the 8c7br1 monoclonal antibody (mab). the antibody reacted against n. meningitidis of serogroups a, b, c, x, y, z, and different serotypes and subtypes of n. meningitidis b and c by means of dot-elisa and immunoblot. it cross-reacted with neisseria gonorrhoeae, neisseria lactamica, haemophilus influenzae type b, escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri, bordetella pertussis, and bacillus subtilis. the 8c7br1 mab reacted with the 65-kda protein present in the prototype meningococcal strains b:16:b6(b2a:p1.5.2) and 2996 (b2b:p1.5.2). in h. influenzae type b, e. coli and b. subtilis, the mab  recognized the protein of 60, 65, and 70 kda, respectively. facs analysis showed  that 8c7brl mab could recognize the 50-kda protein on the surface of n. meningitidis homologous (b:4:p1.9) strain. these results, together with the bactericidal activity of 8c7br1, and an experiment of passive protection in mice, demonstrated the potential importance of the cross-reactive protein as a candidate antigen for n. meningitidis b vaccine composition.

TI  == small genes/gene-products in escherichia coli k-12.
AB  == forty-two protein spots of observed m(r) 6-15 kda were resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, stained by coomassie blue and subjected to edman microsequencing. all of the proteins could be related back to their encoding open reading frames, thereby vindicating the bioinformatic tools currently utilised in their identification. however, only 14/42 gene-products were expressed as annotated. translation was confirmed for 14 open reading frames with no attributed function (ecogene y-entries), while n-terminal sequence allowed the start codon to be accurately annotated for the genes yigf, yccu, yqic, ynfd, and yeex. the methionine start codon was cleaved in 11 gene-products  (atpe, hns, rpoz, rpll, cspc, yccj, yggx, yjgf, hima, infa, rpsq) and a further five showed loss of a signal peptide (pspe, hdeb, hdea, ynfd, ykfe). internal (tig, atpa, tufa) and n-terminal fragmentation (cspd, rpsf, atcu) of much larger  proteins was also detected, which may have resulted from physiological or translational processes. m(r) and pi isoforms were detected respectively for ptsh and gatb, each being phosphoproteins, as well as rply which manifested differences with respect to predicted m(r) and pi. in addition, yjgf was shown to belong to a small gene family of unknown function with ancient conserved regions  across procaryotes and eucaryotes. ygin was revealed to have a paralogue and orthologues in bacillus subtilis, synechocystis sp., mycobacterium tuberculosis,  neisseria gonorrhoea, and rhodococcus erythropolis. orthologues are also reported for yihd, yccu and yeex. of the 14 y-genes, only ykfe possessed no detectable orthologues. these results highlight the need to complement genomic analysis with detailed proteomics in order to gain a better understanding of cellular molecular biology, while the confirmation of the open reading frame start codon using edman degradation protein microsequencing has yet to be superseded by recent advances in mass spectrometry.

TI  == low surface tension calcium hydroxide solution is an effective antiseptic.
AB  == the antimicrobial effects of a saturated calcium hydroxide solution, and in combination with 10% and 20% detergent, were evaluated on streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, neisseria  sp., diphtheroid, staphylococcus aureus, lactobacillus sp., staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis and candida albicans. the saturated calcium hydroxide solution was effective against only four of the 11 microorganisms studied over a 60-min exposure time. the calcium hydroxide solutions containing detergent killed all 11 test organisms over a 30-min exposure time. this difference was statistically significant (p < 0.01). no statistically significant difference in antimicrobial action was found between the 10% and 20% detergent calcium hydroxide solutions (p > 0.01). however, the low surface tension (46.5 x  10(-3) nm-1) and high ph (10.8) of the calcium hydroxide solution with 20% detergent establish it as the more effective solution.

TI  == structural definition of the non-reducing termini of mannose-capped lam from mycobacterium tuberculosis through selective enzymatic degradation and fast atom  bombardment-mass spectrometry.
AB  == the application of extracellular arabinases from a cellulomonas sp. and fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (fab-ms) provided new insight into the structure of lipoarabinomannan (lam) of mycobacterium tuberculosis, a key molecule in the pathogenesis and physiology of the tubercle bacillus. previously, the non-reducing arabinan ends of lam from the virulent (erdman) strain of m. tuberculosis were shown to be 'capped' by short (alpha 1-->2)-linked mannopyranose (manp)-containing oligosaccharides, a product called manlam. the structural relationship between these manp units and the underlying arabinofuranose (araf)-containing arabinan was examined by digesting manlam from  m.tuberculosis erdman with the cellulomonas enzyme, resolving fragments by various means and subjecting the derivatized oligoglycosylalditols to fab-ms. the sequences manp2araf4, manp3araf4 and manp1-6araf6 were recognized as the major terminal motifs. upon complete structural definition, all of the ara6-containing  products were shown to be based on a 3,5-linked branched araf unit, whereas those containing ara4 were linear. minor non-mannosylated terminal arrangements containing ara4-6, branched, linear and cyclical, were also recognized. in addition, the mannan 'core' of manlam was isolated from enzyme digests and shown  to contain segments of the phosphatidylinositol anchor and a 'stub' of the arabinan side-chain in the form of a 'linker' alpha-araf-(1-->5)-araf unit attached to c-2, apparently of the penultimate 2,6-linked manp residue. the structural unravelling of this complex molecule further substantiates the case for structural and biological similarities to the enterobacterial lipopolysaccharides/lipoglycans and other important 'capped' lipooligomers such as the lipooligosaccharides of neisseria species and the lipophosphoglycan of leishmania promastigotes.

TI  == [comparative in vitro bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect of 5 macrolides: roxithromycin, erythromycin, oleandomycin, josamycin and spiramycin against 284 hospital bacterial strains].
AB  == the bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities of five macrolides (roxithromycin, erythromycin, troleandomycin, josamycin and spiramycin) were tested against 284 bacterial strains belonging to various species of gram positive (staphylococci, streptococci, pneumococci, listeria sp, corynebacterium sp, bacillus sp) and gram negative bacteria (neisseria sp, h. influenzae, p. multocida). the activity of these compounds on the whole strains showed near results: 71.8% of susceptible strains to erythromycin and spiramycin, 70% to josamycin, 67.6% to roxithromycin, 65.5% to troleandomycin. resisting strains were mlsb resistant cocci gram positive, h. influenzae and p. multocida strains. species usually less studied (nongroupable streptococci, corynebacterium sp, bacillus sp) were very susceptible to macrolides with mics equal or inferior to 1 mg/l for the two last  genus. a bactericidal effect was observed for 38.8% of 72 tested strains (erythromycin), 36.1% (josamycin), 34.7% (spiramycin), 31.9% (roxithromycin), 20.8% (troleandomycin). among various tested species, this bactericidal effect concerned especially group a streptococci, n. meningitidis and corynebacterium (except d2 and jk species).

TI  == goiter prevalence and bacterial contamination of water supplies.
AB  == previous epidemiological studies have shown a significant statistical correlation (p < 0.005 to p < 0.0005) between goiter prevalence and rock types in the watersheds that supply 37 localities in western columbia. bacterial contamination has also been implicated as a cause of endemic goiter. we, therefore, did bacteriological studies to incorporate this variable into the statistical model in 34 of the 37 localities previously surveyed. samples of the water in the 34 localities were taken at the water source or intake of water supply and at the pipeline system in households and schools. samples were collected in sterile bottles and cultured on several media for 48 h. the number of bacteria per ml was determined by quebec's camera and the bacteria (e. coli, bacillus sp., k. pneumoniae, proteus sp., and neisseria sp.) were identified according to conventional methods. multiple regression analysis and the logistic regression model were used to analyze the data. only two variables had significant relationships with goiter prevalence: k. pneumoniae in the water source (p < 0.01) is related to a lower prevalence and the overall concentration of bacteria  in the pipeline system (p < 0.05) is related to a higher prevalence. multiple regression analysis to compare the effects of bacteriological variables to those  of geological variables indicating rock types showed sedimentary rocks in the watershed associated (p < 0.005) with higher goiter prevalence and an increased concentration of k. pneumoniae in the water source again associated (p < 0.025) with lower goiter prevalence. bacterial concentration in the pipeline system was  of marginal importance (0.05 < p < 0.10). thus, the presence of sedimentary rocks was the best indicator of disease. a second best indicator was the concentration  of k. pneumoniae in the water source. we hypothesize that the lower goiter prevalence associated with k. pneumoniae may be a natural example of biodegradation of the organic contaminants that produce goiter.

AB  == oral and nasal fluids of 50 dogs were examined to determine the prevalence of aerobic bacteria frequently associated with animal bite wounds. the most frequently isolated microorganisms included: iij, ef-4, pasteurella multocida, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, group d streptococci, corynebacterium sp., enterobacteria, neisseria sp., moraxella sp., and bacillus sp. other species and genera were infrequently recovered and may represent transient flora. the high incidence of iij, ef-4, p. multocida, and s. aureus, all known human pathogens, suggests that they should be considered as probably contaminants in bite wounds.
