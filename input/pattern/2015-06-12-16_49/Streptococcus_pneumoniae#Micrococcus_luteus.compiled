TI  - Antimicrobial, antitumor and brine shrimp lethality assay of Ranunculus arvensis  L. extracts.
AB  - To investigate the antitumor activity, brine shrimp lethality assay, antibacterial and antifungal activity of Methanol Extract (ME), Water Extract (WE), Acetone Extract (AE), Chloroform Extract (CE), Methanol-Water Extract (MWE), Methanol-Acetone Extract (MAE), Methanol-Chloroform Extract (MCE) of Ranunculus arvensis (L.). Antitumor activity was evaluated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens (At10) induced potato disc assay. Cytotoxicity was evaluated with brine shrimp lethality assay. Antibacterial activity was evaluated with six bacterial strains including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Micrococcus luteus and Streptococcus anginosus and antifungal screening was done against five fungal strains including Aspergillus niger, A. flavus, A. fumigates, Fusarium solani and Mucor species by using disc diffusion method. Best antitumor activity was obtained with ME and WE, having highest IC50 values 20.27 +/- 1.62 and 93.01 +/- 1.33mug/disc. Brine shrimp lethality assay showed LC50 values of AE, MAE and ME were obtained as 384.66 +/- 9.42mug/ml, 724.11 +/- 8.01mug/ml and 978.7 +/-8.01 mug/ml respectively. WE of R. arvensis revealed weak antimicrobial result against the tested microorganisms. On the other hand, the antifungal activity of the plant extracts was found to be insignificant. These findings demonstrate that extracts of R. arvensis possesses significant antitumor activity. Further extensive study is necessary to assess the therapeutic potential of the plant.
TI  - Site-directed mutations in the lanthipeptide mutacin 1140.
AB  - The oral bacterium Streptococcus mutans, strain JH1140, produces the antibiotic mutacin 1140. Mutacin 1140 belongs to a group of antibiotics called lanthipeptides. More specifically, mutacin 1140 is related to the epidermin type A(I) lanthipeptides. Mutagenesis experiments of this group of lanthipeptides have been primarily restricted to the posttranslationally modified meso-lanthionine and 3-methyllanthionine residues. Site-directed mutagenesis of the core peptide of mutacin 1140 was performed using the suicide vector pVA891. Substitutions of the N-terminal residue, the charged residue in the hinge region, and residues in ring A and intertwined rings C and D were investigated. A truncation and insertion of residues in ring A and intertwined rings C and D were also performed to determine whether or not they would alter the antimicrobial activity of the producing strain. Bioassays revealed that five of 14 mutants studied had improved antimicrobial activity against the indicator strain Micrococcus luteus ATCC 10240. MICs against Streptococcus mutans UA159, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 27336, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Clostridium difficile UK1, and Micrococcus luteus ATCC 10240 were determined for three mutacin 1140 variants that had the most significant increases in bioactivity in the M. luteus bioassay. This mutagenesis study of the epidermin group of lanthipeptides shows that antimicrobial activity can be significantly improved.
TI  - Antineoplastic agents. 573. isolation and structure of papilistatin from the papilionid butterfly Byasa polyeuctes termessa.
AB  - Bioassay-guided separation of an extract of the wings from a Taiwan butterfly, Byasa polyeuctes termessa, allowed isolation of a new cancer cell growth inhibitor designated papilistatin (1a). The structure was determined by analysis of 1D and 2D NMR spectra and by HRMS. Against a panel of six human and the murine P388 leukemia cancer cell lines, papilistatin exhibited cancer cell growth inhibition with GI(50)'s of 0.093-3.5 microg/mL. Papilistatin was also found to have antibacterial activity.
TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial activity, phenol and flavonoid contents of Thespesia  populnea flower extracts.
AB  - Flavonoids which were reported as having many pharmacological activities, antimicrobial, antioxidant, cytotoxic, chemoprevention activities and they possess strong antiproliferative effects related to inhibition of cell cycle progression and apoptosis induction. On the basis of this Thespesia populnea (L.) Sol. Ex Correa (Family-Malvaceae) was selected and it is having the major composition of flavonoids and the antibacterial activity of methanolic extract of Thespesia populnea flowers was investigated by agar well diffusion method. Furthermore our phytochemical studies indicated that methanolic extract of Thespesia populnea flowers contains flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins and anthroquinone glycosides. Moreover the individual components were identified by thin layer chromatography and Rf value was compared with standard flavonoid quercetin. The total phenolic and flavonoid content studies were also quantified. The bacteria used for antibacterial study were Shigella flexneri (NCIM 4924), Rhodococcus terrae (NCIM 5126), Escherichiae coli (ATCC 11775), Streptococcus faecalis (NCIB 2406), Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 13883),Brevibacterium luteum (NCIM 2923), Micrococcus flavum (NCIM 2376), Proteus mirabilis (NCIB 8268), Bacillus licheniformis (NCIM 2468), Micrococcus luteus (ATCC 2984), Flavobacterium devorans (NCIM 2581), Shigella sonei(ATCC 29930), Shigella boydii (ATCC 8700) and Shigella dysentriae (ATCC 13313).According to our results in the lowest tested concentration of 62.5 microg/ml and 125mug/ml 7.2% of the plant extract were active, 5% active in the concentration of 250 microg/ml, 75.7% active in the concentration of 500 microg/ml and 92.8% active at the concentration of 1000 microg/ml in a dose dependent manner.
TI  - Oxidation of lanthionines renders the lantibiotic nisin inactive.
AB  - The peptide antibiotic nisin A belongs to the group of antibiotics called lantibiotics. They are classified as lantibiotics because they contain the structural group lanthionine. Lanthionines are composed of a single sulfur atom that is linked to the beta-carbons of two alanine moieties. These sulfur atoms are vulnerable to environmental oxidation. A mild oxidation reaction was performed on nisin A to determine the relative effects it would have on bioactivity. High-mass-accuracy Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry data revealed the addition of seven, eight, and nine oxygens. These additions correspond to the five lanthionines, two methionines, and two histidines that would be susceptible to oxidation. Subsequent bioassays revealed that the oxidized form of nisin A had a complete loss of bactericidal activity. In a competition study, the oxidized nisin did not appear to have an antagonistic affect on the bioactivity of nisin A, since the addition of an equal molar concentration of the oxidized variant did not have an influence on the bactericidal activity of the native antibiotic. Electron microscopy data revealed that the oxidized forms were still capable of assembling into large circular complexes, demonstrating that oxidation does not disrupt the lateral assembly mechanism of the antibiotic. Affinity thin-layer chromatography and fluorescence microscopy experiments suggested that the loss of activity is due to the inability of the oxidized form of nisin to bind to the cell wall precursor lipid II. Given the loss of bioactivity following oxidation, oxidation should be an important factor to consider in future production, purification, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic studies.
TI  - Mitracarpus frigidus aerial parts exhibited potent antimicrobial, antileishmanial, and antioxidant effects.
AB  - The crude extract and the hexane, CH(2)Cl(2), EtOAc, n-BuOH, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of Mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of Leishmania (L. chagasi and L. amazonensis), 11 strains of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica sorovar Tythimurium, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans). The antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. Phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. All samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. S. sonnei, B. cereus and C. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-BuOH and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. The lowest MIC was recorded for the CH(2)Cl(2) fraction against C. neoformans (MIC of 10 microg/ml), followed by B. cereus, S. sonnei, and E. cloacae (MIC of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). The CH(2)Cl(2) fraction was the most effective against L. chagasi (IC(50) of 6.7 microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against L. amazonensis (IC(50) of 9 microg/ml). A cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and CH(2)Cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. These results suggest that M. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.
TI  - Search for antibacterial and antifungal agents from selected Indian medicinal plants.
AB  - A series of 61 Indian medicinal plants belonging to 33 different families used in various infectious disorders, were screened for their antimicrobial properties. Screening was carried out at 1000 and 500 microg/ml concentrations by agar dilution method against Bacillus cereus var mycoides, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus subtilis, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Twenty-eight plant extracts showed activity against at least one of the test organisms used in the screening. On the basis of the results obtained, we conclude that the crude extracts of Dorema ammoniacum, Sphaeranthus indicus, Dracaena cinnabari, Mallotus philippinensis, Jatropha gossypifolia, Aristolochia indica, Lantana camara, Nardostachys jatamansi, Randia dumetorum and Cassia fistula exhibited significant antimicrobial activity and properties that support folkloric use in the treatment of some diseases as broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. This probably explains the use of these plants by the indigenous people against a number of infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial, wound healing and antioxidant activity of Plagiochasma appendiculatum Lehm. et Lind.
AB  - Plagiochasma appendiculatum (Aytoniaceae) of the order Marchantiales is widely used in the form of paste ethnomedicinally by Gaddi tribe in Kangra valley for treating skin diseases. In this context, antimicrobical potential of Plagiochasma appendiculatum against a wide range of microorganisms was studied. To validate the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in skin diseases, wound healing activity was studied, besides antioxidant activity to understand the mechanism of wound healing activity. The plant (alchoholic and aqueous extract) showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all the organisms: Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, and eight fungi Candida albicans and Cryptococcus albidus-dimorphic fungi, Trichophyton rubrum-dermatophyte fungi, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus spinulosus, Aspergillus terreus and Aspergillus nidulans-systemic fungi, with especially good activity against the dermatophyte (Trichophyton rubrum) and some infectious bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella typhimurium) with an MIC of 2.5 microg/disc. The results show that Plagiochasma appendiculatum extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. The results also indicated that Plagiochasma appendiculatum extract possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and increase in the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Catalase activity.
TI  - Antimicrobial spectrum, production and mode of action of staphylococcin 188 produced by Staphylococcus aureus 188.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus 188 has been shown to produce bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance known as staphylococcin 188. It has a broad-activity spectrum against Micrococcus luteus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus viridans, Corynebacterium diphtheriae and several staphylococcus species. The arbitrary unit of staphylococcin 188 against Micrococcus luteus was 1280 AU/mL. Its production with simultaneous measurement of activity was monitored and was found to produce maximum amount of staphylococcin after 7 hours of incubation. Mode of action of the staphylococcin 188 on the sensitive cells was bactericidal rather than bacterioloytic.
TI  - Purification of bovine milk lactoperoxidase and investigation of antibacterial properties at different thiocyanate mediated.
AB  - Bovine lactoperoxidase (LPO) was purified with amberlite CG 50 H+ resin, CM sephadex C-50 ion-exchange chromatography, and sephadex G-100 gel filtration chromatography from skim milk. The activity of lactoperoxidase was measured by using 2.2-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6 sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) as a choromogenic substrate at pH 6.0. Purification degree for the purified enzyme was controlled with SDS-PAGE and Rz value (A412/A280). Rz value for the purified LPO was 0.8. Km value at pH 6.0 at 20 degrees C for the LPO was 0.20 mM. Vmax value was 7.87 micromol/ml min at pH 6.0 at 20 degrees C. Bovine LPO showed high antibacterial activity in 100 mM thiocyanate--100 mM H2O2 medium for some pathogenic bacteria, such as Aeromonas hydrophila ATCC 7966, Micrococcus luteus LA 2971, Mycobacterium smegmatis RUT, Bacillus subtilis IMG 22, Pseudomonas pyocyanea, Bacillus subtilis var. niger ATCC 10, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 15753, Bacillus brevis FMC3, Klebsiella pneumoniae FMC 5, Corynebacterium xerosis UC 9165, Bacillus cereus EU, Bacillus megaterium NRS, Yersinia enterocolytica, Listeria monocytogenes scoot A, Bacillus megaterium EU, Bacillus megaterium DSM32, Klebsiella oxytocica, Staphylococcus aerogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium smegmatis CCM 2067 and compared with well known antibacterial substances such as penicilline, ampicilline, amoxicillin-clavulanate and ceftriaxon. The LPO--100 mM thiocyanate--100 mM H2O2 system was purposed as an effective agent against many of the diseases causing organisms in human and animals.
TI  - Synthesis and biological evaluation of novel leucomycin analogues modified at the C-3 position. I. Epimerization and methylation of the 3-hydroxyl group.
AB  - The synthesis and biological evaluation of sixteen-membered macrolides modified at the C-3 position are described. 3-Epi-leucomycin A7 (9), 3-O-acyl-3-epi-leucomycin A7 analogues (11a-11e), 3-O-acylleucomycin A7 analogues (13b-13e) and 3-O-methylleucomycin analogues (16a, 16b and 22) were synthesized via fully protected intermediates (7, 5a, 5b and 20). After appropriate modification, subsequent deprotections were performed to furnish a variety of leucomycin analogues. Methylation of the 3-hydroxyl group was found to improve the pharmacoprofile of leucomycin antibiotics. 3-O-Methylrokitamycin (16b) showed enhanced antibacterial activity in vitro and 3,3''-di-O-methyl-4''-O-(3-methylbutyl)leucomycin V (22) exhibited improved metabolic stability in rat plasma in vitro.
TI  - Comparative distribution of azithromycin in lung tissue of patients given oral daily doses of 500 and 1000 mg.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The administration of antibacterial agents should be optimized on the basis of their distribution to enhance drug exposure and obtain bacterial eradication. This study examines the pharmacokinetics of azithromycin in plasma, lung tissue and bronchial washing in patients after oral administration of 500 mg versus 1000 mg once daily for 3 days. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Samples of plasma, lung tissue and bronchial washing were obtained from a cohort of 48 patients during open-chest surgery for lung resection up to 204 h after the last drug dose, and assayed for antibiotic concentrations. RESULTS: Azithromycin was widely distributed within the lower respiratory tract and sustained levels of the drug were detectable at the last sampling time in lung tissue. Doubling the dose of the antibiotic resulted in a proportional increase in lung area under the curve (AUC, 1245.4 versus 2514.2 h x mg/kg) and peak tissue concentration (Cmax, 8.93 +/- 2.05 versus 18.6 +/- 2.20 mg/kg). The pharmacodynamic parameter AUC/MIC for susceptible and intermediate strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MICs 0.5 and 2 mg/L, respectively) increased after administration of the 1000 mg schedule compared with 500 mg (AUC/MIC0.5 2414 versus 1144 and AUC/MIC2 2112 versus 814.1 h x mg/kg, respectively) in pulmonary tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Lung exposure to azithromycin is increased proportionally by doubling the dose, which results in a predictable pharmacokinetic behaviour of the drug in the lower respiratory tract.
TI  - A variety of gram-positive bacteria carry mobile mef genes.
AB  - The mefE gene codes for a membrane bound efflux protein, which confers resistance to macrolides, and has been identified in Streptococcus pneumoniae. A variety of gram-positive organisms were examined. Twenty-six isolates of S. pneumoniae carried mefE and were resistant to erythromycin (MIC of 2-16 mg/L). Two additional isolates of Emr S. pneumoniae carried both ermB and mefE(MIC of 16-128 mg/L). One Micrococcus luteus, one Corynebacterium jeikeium, three Corynebacterium spp., two viridans streptococci and seven Enterocccus spp. also carried mef genes. It was possible to move the mef gene from all 11 S. pneumoniae tested to susceptible S. pneumoniae and/or Enterococcus faecalis recipients. The addition of DNase (1 g/L) did not affect the gene transfer. It was also possible to move the mef gene from donor Enterococcus spp., viridans streptococci, M. luteus, C. jeikeium and Corynebacterium spp. to E. faecalis recipients. Transconjugant isolates were resistant to erythromycin (MIC = 16 mg/L). Hybridization with a labelled mef oligonucleotide probe against Southern blots and bacterial dot blots confirmed the presence of the mef genes. This is the first time that a mobile mef gene has been identified in four different genera, from three distinct geographical locations.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Byrsonima crassifolia (L.) H.B.K.
AB  - From Byrsonima crassifolia (L.) H.B.K. a tropical tree widely distributed in Mexico, Central and South America, which has been used medicinally since prehispanic times, we report here the antibacterial activities of organic extracts of roots and stems. The ethyl acetate of roots was the most active against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epididermis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Micrococcus luteus.
TI  - A promoter associated with the neisserial repeat can be used to transcribe the uvrB gene from Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
AB  - A recombinant plasmid capable of restoring UV resistance to an Escherichia coli uvrB mutant was isolated from a genomic library of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame whose deduced amino acid sequence displayed significant similarity to those of the UvrB proteins of E. coli, Micrococcus luteus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. A gonococcal uvrB mutant was constructed and found to be extremely sensitive to UV radiation. Transcriptional fusions between portions of the gonococcal uvrB upstream region and a reporter gene were used to localize promoter activity, and the transcriptional start point of the gonococcal uvrB gene was mapped in E. coli by primer extension. A corresponding sigma 70 promoter was identified within a copy of the 26-bp neisserial repeat, and this identification provided the first evidence of a promoter associated with this repetitive element in N. gonorrhoeae.
TI  - Macrophage response to bacteria: induction of marked secretory and cellular activities by lipoteichoic acids.
AB  - Lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) from various bacterial species, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Listeria monocytogenes, were examined for the ability to induce secretory and cellular responses in a pure population of bone marrow-derived mononuclear phagocytes. Some of the highly purified LTAs, in particular LTAs from Bacillus subtilis, S. pyogenes, E. faecalis, and Enterococcus hirae, were able to affect each of the macrophage parameters measured, i.e., reductive capacity, secretion of tumor necrosis factor and nitrite, and tumoricidal activity. As after stimulation with whole organisms or other bacterial products, secretion of tumor necrosis factor induced by these LTAs reached its maximum within the first few hours of the interaction, while secretion of nitrite and tumoricidal activity required 24 to 36 h for full expression. Other purified LTAs, i.e., LTAs from Streptococcus sanguis, S. pneumoniae, and L. monocytogenes, as well as lipomannan from Micrococcus luteus affected only some of these parameters, while native LTA from S. aureus was inactive. There was no obvious correlation between biological activity and chain length, kind of glycosyl substituents, glycolipid structures, or fatty acid composition of LTAs. Deacylation of LTAs resulted in a complete loss of activity, and deacylated LTAs did not impair the activity of their acylated counterparts, suggesting that acyl chains may be essential for binding of LTA to the cell surface. The results demonstrate that some LTA species are potent inducers of macrophage secretory and cellular activities.
TI  - Structure of the gene complementing uvr-402 in Streptococcus pneumoniae: homology with Escherichia coli uvrB and the homologous gene in Micrococcus luteus.
AB  - The repair ability for UV-induced damage observed for Streptococcus pneumoniae proceeds through a system similar to the Uvr-dependent system in Escherichia coli. The DNA sequence of a gene complementing uvr-402, a mutation conferring UV sensitivity, was determined. Alignments of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed an extensive sequence homology of 55% with the UvrB protein of E. coli and 59% with the UvrB-homologous protein of Micrococcus luteus. Nucleotide-binding site consensus was observed. The high conservation of the uvrB-like gene among these three species suggests that the role of the UvrB protein and excision repair in general might be very important for cell survival.
TI  - Excision-repair capacity of UV-irradiated strains of Escherichia coli and Streptococcus pneumoniae, estimated by plasmid recovery.
AB  - Although the biological role of many bacterial repair genes is known, there is still an interest in evaluating the capacity of repair pyrimidine dimers in some strains. For this purpose, we have developed a rapid assay. Cells bearing a plasmid are UV irradiated and incubated to allow recovery. The plasmid DNA is extracted, purified and treated with UV endonuclease from Micrococcus luteus that specifically produces single strand breaks at the site of pyrimidine dimers. The amount of open circular and covalently closed circular forms of the plasmid DNA after treatment and post-incubation provides an estimate of the repair capability of the host strain. The wild type strain and the uvrA mutant of Escherichia coli were used to adjust the assay. The lexA mutant of E. coli has been tested and its repair capability is equivalent to that of wild-type strain. The assay has been extended to Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is naturally deficient in photoreactivation and SOS-like functions. This strain is efficient in the repair of pyrimidine dimers, formed after UV irradiation.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetics of cefoperazone concentration in human lung tissue].
AB  - In 11 patients, the concentration of cefoperazone (CPZ) in the lung tissue were studied after a 2 g intravenous bolus injection. Samples of lung tissue and blood were taken during surgery at 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, and 300 minutes after administration of CPZ. All samples were assayed by the paper disc method using Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341 as the indicator strain. All assay results of lung tissue were corrected for the amount of blood contained in the tissue samples by the hemoglobin content in the homogenate of lung tissue. The CPZ levels in the lung tissue were 116.2 micrograms/g at 15 min., 94.1 micrograms/g at 30 min., 74.6 micrograms/g at 60 min., 67.9 micrograms/g at 120 min., 54.6 micrograms/g at 180 min., 29.2 micrograms/g at 240 min. and 22.7 micrograms/g at 300 min. after administration, respectively. These values were higher than MIC90 values of CPZ for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Enterobacteriaceae. The level of CPZ in the lung tissue was higher than 50% of the level in the serum until 180 minutes after administration of CPZ.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of teicoplanin for therapy of severe infections caused by gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Teicoplanin was evaluated in 47 patients with severe infections, including 14 patients with bone infections, 11 patients with soft-tissue infections, 7 patients with endocarditis, 5 patients with pneumonia, 3 patients with septic thrombophlebitis, 3 patients with septicemia of unknown origin, and 4 patients with miscellaneous infections. Overall, bacteremia was documented in 24 patients. The pathogens isolated were 35 strains of Staphylococcus aureus (including 8 methicillin-resistant strains), 4 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 4 strains of Streptococcus faecalis, 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 5 strains of other streptococci, and 1 Micrococcus luteus strain. A total of 22 patients (46.8%) were clinically cured, 8 patients (17.0%) improved, 2 patients (4.3%) had relapses after initial improvement, and 15 patients (31.9%) failed to respond. The results were better in nonbacteremic patients (19 of 23 patients [82.6%] were cured or improved) than in patients with bacteremia (12 of 24 patients [50%] were cured or improved). Bacteriological cure occurred in 25 patients (53.2%), and superinfections were documented in 6 patients (12.8%). No major adverse effects were observed. We conclude that teicoplanin is a potentially effective and well-tolerated antimicrobial agent for therapy of nonbacteremic infections caused by gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - [Reactivity to bacterial peptidoglycans in a phagocytosis system. The range of immunological specificity of Escherichia coli peptidoglycan].
AB  - The antigenic specificity of E. coli M17 peptidoglycans (PG) was studied in the test system based on the stimulation of neutrophils with PG opsonized with the whole and exhausted IgG fraction of human serum. Within the generic taxon, the PG under study were similar in their antigenic properties. The opsonic activity of IgG exhausted with the preparations of different E. coli strains decreased by 93.2-95.8%. An essential difference of E. coli PG from similar components of other representatives of the family Enterobacteriaceae was observed: in experiments with Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus rettgeri the decrease of opsonic activity was 47.6-79.3%. After the removal of antibodies to PG of remote taxons (Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, Branchamella catarrhalis) the decrease of the opsonic effect was less noticeable (9.7-33.8%). The results are discussed from the viewpoint of the immunological peculiarity of PG at different taxonomic levels.
TI  - Messenger RNA from allotype-defined rabbits directing the cell-free synthesis of  immunoglobulin heavy and light chains.
AB  - In vitro synthesis studies were performed utilizing polyA(+)-RNA and lymphocytes  from the spleens of rabbits hyperimmunized with Micrococcus luteus or Streptococcus pneumoniae (type III). PolyA(+)-RNA isolated after 4 M guanidinium thiocyanate extraction and oligo(dT)-selection appeared to be undegraded on CH3HgOH-agarose gel electrophoresis and demonstrated biological activity when translated in a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free system. The electrophoretic patterns of the specifically immunoprecipitated cell-free products were compared with those of Nonidet-P40 extracts (lysates) and secretions (supernatants) from rabbit spleen lymphocyte cultures and serum proteins. Kappa light chains with specific b allotypes, as well as immunoglobulin heavy chains, were identified. The efficient translation of mRNA of defined allotypes was a necessary prerequisite for production of characterized cDNA clones and identification of genomic sequences for rabbit immunoglobulin heavy and light chains.
