TI  == influence of the magnetic field on microorganisms in the oral cavity.
AB  == since the beginning of their lives, all living organisms are exposed to the influence of geomagnetic fields. objectives: with respect to the positive effects that magnetic fields have on human tissues, especially the bactericidal effect, this investigation aimed to assess their influence on the reduction of oral microorganisms. material and methods: in order to obtain adequate specimens of dental plaque deposit, microbes such as streptococcus parasanguinis, staphylococcus epidermidis, rhodococcus equi and candida albicans were isolated from the human mouth. to establish the intensity of microbial growth on the basis of the modified optical density (od) of agar turbidimetry assay, microbial count  and spectrophotometry were applied. the study was carried out with two microbial  concentrations (1 and 10 cfu/ml) after periods of incubation of 24 and 48 h and using micromagnets. results: a positive effect of the magnetic field, resulting in the reduction of dental plaque microbes in vitro, was found. in the first 24 hours of exposure to the magnetic field, the number of all isolated microbes was  significantly reduced. the most potent influence of magnets and the most intensified reduction after 24 hours were evident in candida albicans colonies. the decrease in the influence of magnets on microbes in vitro was also detected.  conclusions: magnets reduce the number of microbes and might be recommended as a  supplement in therapy for reduced periodontal tissues. this is important because  periodontal tissues that are in good conditions provide prolonged support to the  oral tissues under partial and supradental denture.

TI  == glycosyltransferase-mediated sweet modification in oral streptococci.
AB  == bacterial glycosyltransferases play important roles in bacterial fitness and virulence. oral streptococci have evolved diverse strategies to survive and thrive in the carbohydrate-rich oral cavity. in this review, we discuss 2 important biological processes mediated by 2 distinct groups of glycosyltransferases in oral streptococci that are important for bacterial colonization and virulence. the first process is the glycosylation of highly conserved serine-rich repeat adhesins by a series of glycosyltransferases. using  streptococcus parasanguinis as a model, we highlight new features of several glycosyltransferases that sequentially modify the serine-rich glycoprotein fap1.  distinct features of a novel glycosyltransferase fold from a domain of unknown function 1792 are contrasted with common properties of canonical glycosyltransferases. the second biological process we cover is involved in building sticky glucan matrix to establish cariogenic biofilms by an important opportunistic pathogen streptococcus mutans through the action of a family of 3 glucosyltransferases. we focus on discussing the structural feature of this family as a glycoside hydrolase family of enzymes. while the 2 processes are distinct, they all produce carbohydrate-coated biomolecules, which enable bacteria to stick better in the complex oral microbiome. understanding the making of the sweet modification presents a unique opportunity to develop novel antiadhesion and antibiofilm strategies to fight infections by oral streptococci  and beyond.

TI  == immunomodulatory properties of streptococcus and veillonella isolates from the human small intestine microbiota.
AB  == the human small intestine is a key site for interactions between the intestinal microbiota and the mucosal immune system. here we investigated the immunomodulatory properties of representative species of commonly dominant small-intestinal microbial communities, including six streptococcal strains (four streptococcus salivarius, one s. equinus, one s. parasanguinis) one veillonella parvula strain, one enterococcus gallinarum strain, and lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1 as a bench mark strain on human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. the different streptococci induced varying levels of the cytokines il-8, tnf-alpha, and il-12p70, while the v. parvula strain showed a strong capacity to induce il-6. e. gallinarum strain was a potent inducer of cytokines and tlr2/6 signalling. as streptococcus and veillonella can potentially interact metabolically and frequently co-occur in ecosystems, immunomodulation by pair-wise combinations of strains were also tested for their combined immunomodulatory properties. strain combinations induced cytokine responses in dendritic cells that differed from what might be expected on the basis of the results obtained with the individual strains. a combination of (some) streptococci with veillonella appeared to negate il-12p70 production, while augmenting il-8, il-6, il-10, and tnf-alpha responses. this suggests that immunomodulation data obtained in vitro with individual strains are unlikely to adequately represent immune responses to mixtures of gut microbiota communities in vivo. nevertheless, analysing the immune responses of strains representing the dominant species in the intestine may help to identify immunomodulatory mechanisms that influence immune homeostasis.

TI  == oral streptococci and nitrite-mediated interference of pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == the oral cavity harbors a diverse community of microbes that are physiologically  unique. oral microbes that exist in this polymicrobial environment can be pathogenic or beneficial to the host. numerous oral microbes contribute to the formation of dental caries and periodontitis; however, there is little understanding of the role these microbes play in systemic infections. there is mounting evidence that suggests that oral commensal streptococci are cocolonized  with pseudomonas aeruginosa during cystic fibrosis pulmonary infections and that  the presence of these oral streptococci contributes to improved lung function. the goal of this study was to examine the underlying mechanism by which streptococcus parasanguinis antagonizes pathogenic p. aeruginosa. in this study,  we discovered that oral commensal streptococci, including streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus sanguinis, and streptococcus gordonii, inhibit the growth of p. aeruginosa and that this inhibition is mediated by the presence of nitrite and the production of hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) by oral streptococci. the  requirement of both h2o2 and nitrite for the inhibition of p. aeruginosa is due to the generation of reactive nitrogenous intermediates (rni), including peroxynitrite. transposon mutagenesis showed that a p. aeruginosa mutant defective in a putative abc transporter permease is resistant to both streptococcus/nitrite- and peroxynitrite-mediated killing. furthermore, s. parasanguinis protects drosophila melanogaster from killing by p. aeruginosa in a nitrite-dependent manner. our findings suggest that the combination of nitrite and h2o2 may represent a unique anti-infection strategy by oral streptococci during polymicrobial infections.

TI  == the highly conserved domain of unknown function 1792 has a distinct glycosyltransferase fold.
AB  == more than 33,000 glycosyltransferases have been identified. structural studies, however, have only revealed two distinct glycosyltransferase (gt) folds, gt-a and gt-b. here we report a 1.34-a resolution x-ray crystallographic structure of a previously uncharacterized 'domain of unknown function' 1792 (duf1792) and show that the domain adopts a new fold and is required for glycosylation of a family of serine-rich repeat streptococcal adhesins. biochemical studies reveal that the domain is a glucosyltransferase, and it catalyses the transfer of glucose to the  branch point of the hexasaccharide o-linked to the serine-rich repeat of the bacterial adhesin, fap1 of streptococcus parasanguinis. duf1792 homologues from both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria also exhibit the activity. thus, duf1792 represents a new family of glycosyltransferases; therefore, we designate  it as a gt-d glycosyltransferase fold. as the domain is highly conserved in bacteria and not found in eukaryotes, it can be explored as a new antibacterial target.

TI  == altered bacterial profiles in saliva from adults with caries lesions: a case-cohort study.
AB  == the aim of this study was to learn whether presence of caries in an adult population was associated with a salivary bacterial profile different from that of individuals without untreated caries. stimulated saliva samples from 621 participants of the danish health examination survey were analyzed using the human oral microbe identification microarray technology. samples from 174 individuals with dental caries and 447 from a control cohort were compared using  frequency and levels of identified bacterial taxa/clusters as endpoints. differences at taxon/cluster level were analyzed using mann-whitney's test with benjamini-hochberg correction for multiple comparisons. principal component analysis was used to visualize bacterial community profiles. a reduced bacterial  diversity was observed in samples from subjects with dental caries. five bacterial taxa (veillonella parvula, veillonella atypica, megasphaera micronuciformis, fusobacterium periodontium and achromobacter xylosoxidans) and one bacterial cluster (leptotrichia sp. clones c3mkm102 and gt018_ot417/462) were less frequently found in the caries group (adjusted p value <0.01) while two bacterial taxa (solobacterium moorei and streptococcus salivarius) and three bacterial clusters (streptococcus parasanguinis i and ii and sp. clone be024_ot057/411/721, streptococcus parasanguinis i and ii and sinensis_ot411/721/767, streptococcus salivarius and sp. clone fo042_ot067/755) were present at significantly higher levels (adjusted p value <0.01). the principal component analysis displayed a marked difference in the bacterial community profiles between groups. presence of manifest caries was associated with a reduced diversity and an altered salivary bacterial community profile. our data support recent theories that ecological stress-induced changes of commensal  microbial communities are involved in the shift from oral health to tooth decay.

TI  == gtfa and gtfb are both required for protein o-glycosylation in lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == acm2, the major autolysin of lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1, was recently found to be o-glycosylated with n-acetylhexosamine, likely n-acetylglucosamine (glcnac). in this study, we set out to identify the glycosylation machinery by employing a  comparative genomics approach to identify gtf1 homologues, which are involved in  fimbria-associated protein 1 (fap1) glycosylation in streptococcus parasanguinis. this in silico approach resulted in the identification of 6 candidate l. plantarum wcfs1 genes with significant homology to gtf1, namely, tage1 to tage6.  these candidate genes were targeted by systematic gene deletion, followed by assessment of the consequences on glycosylation of acm2. we observed a changed mobility of acm2 on sds-page in the tage5e6 deletion strain, while deletion of other tage genes resulted in acm2 mobility comparable to that of the wild type. subsequent mass spectrometry analysis of excised and in-gel-digested acm2 confirmed the loss of glycosylation on acm2 in the tage5e6 deletion mutant, whereas a lectin blot using glcnac-specific succinylated wheat germ agglutinin (swga) revealed that besides acm2, tage5e6 deletion also abolished all but one other swga-reactive, protease-sensitive signal. only complementation of both tage5 and tage6 restored those swga lectin signals, establishing that tage5 and tage6 are both required for the glycosylation of acm2 as well as the vast majority of other swga-reactive proteins. finally, swga lectin blotting experiments using a panel of 8 other l. plantarum strains revealed that protein glycosylation is a common feature in l. plantarum strains. with the establishment of these enzymes as protein glycosyltransferases, we propose to rename tage5 and  tage6 as gtfa and gtfb, respectively.

TI  == population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated from the upper respiratory tract of patients in the community.
AB  == a study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated the upper respiratory tract of adult and paediatric patients within the community. vgs are common commensal bacterial inhabitants of  the upper respiratory tract and valuable sentinel reporters of underlying antibiotic resistance (ar). laboratory examination of the colonising vgs species  may provide a valuable ecological description of the species isolated from the upper respiratory tract and their antibiotic susceptibility, including an estimation of the ar reservoir in this population. freshly obtained nasal and oropharyngeal swabs from 84 patients were examined by selective conventional culture on mitis-salivarius agar and yielded 363 isolates of vgs. sequence analyses of the rpnb and 16-23s rrna its genes identified these isolates to belong to 10 species of vgs and included s. anginosus, s. australis, s. constellatus, s. infantis, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius,  s. sanguinis and s. vestibularis. the most frequent vgs organisms isolated was s. salivarius (282/363; 78.0%), followed by s. sanguinis (23/363; 6.3%), s. parasanguinis (21/363; 5.8%), s. mitis (18/363; 5.0%), s. anginosus (5/363; 1.4%), s. vestibularis (5/363; 1.4%), s. australis (3/363; 0.8%), s. oralis (3/363; 0.8%), s. infantis (1/363; 0.3%) and s. constellatus (1/363; 0.3%). all patients examined carried at least one vgs organism, where there were 17 combination patterns of carriage of the 10 species of vgs species isolated, where 54.2%, 37.3%, 7.2% and 1.2% of patients harboured one, two, three and four different vgs species, respectively. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by  standard disk diffusion assay testing against four classes of antibiotics, including the b-lactams [cefotaxime, cefuroxime], the tetracyclines [doxycycline], the fluoroquinolones [levofloxacin] and the macrolides [erythromycin]. overall, there was no resistance to levofloxacin and cefuroxime,  with limited resistance to cefotaxime (3.3%) and doxycycline (9.8%). antibiotic resistance was highest in erythromycin, where 40.9% of isolates were resistant. s. vestibularis was the most antibiotic resistance of all vgs species examined (s. vestibularis v s. salivarius p=0.011), followed by s. anginosis. s. salivarius was the most antibiotic susceptible vgs species examined. overall, given their infrequency in causing infection, relatively few studies to date have attempted to examine their ecology in their preferred body niche, namely the upper respiratory tract. however, knowing their prevalence is becoming increasingly important in relation to their ability to exclude significant respiratory pathogens, including streptococcus pneumoniae. in conclusion, these data indicate that vgs colonisation of the upper respiratory tract in individuals within the community is dominated mainly with relatively antibiotic susceptible s. salivarius.

TI  == identification of streptococcus parasanguinis dna contamination in human buccal dna samples.
AB  == background: the use of buccal swabs in clinical and scientific studies is a very  popular method of collecting dna, due to its non-invasive nature of collection. however, contamination of the dna sample may interfere with analysis. findings: here we report the finding of streptococcus parasanguinis bacterial dna contamination in human buccal dna samples, which led to preferential amplification of bacterial sequence with pcr primers designed against human sequence. conclusion: contamination of buccal-derived dna with bacterial dna can  be significant, and may influence downstream genetic analysis. one needs to be aware of possible bacterial contamination when interpreting abnormal findings following pcr amplification of buccal swab dna samples.

TI  == evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  versatrek blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere, northbrook, il) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. a total of 148 versatrek redox 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating gram-positive bacteria were tested. results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identifications. we obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (24), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (14), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (17), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus parasanguinis (2), streptococcus sanguinis (1), streptococcus cristatus (1), the streptococcus bovis group (5), streptococcus agalactiae (9), the streptococcus anginosus group (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre fcm) (16), vancomycin-susceptible  enterococcus faecalis (3), aerococcus viridans (2), bacillus (6), corynebacterium (8), lactobacillus (2), micrococcus (2), neisseria mucosa (1), escherichia coli (3), candida tropicalis (1), propionibacterium (1), and rothia (1). overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. a total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. we tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. a chart review of 31 patients with mrsa, mssa, or vre demonstrated that the nanosphere bc-gp assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with mrsa or vre. the bc-gp assay may have a positive impact on patient  care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.

TI  == the expression of the operon is crucial for the survival of fw213 within macrophages but not acid tolerance.
AB  == the acquisition of transition metal ions is essential for the viability and in some cases the expression of virulence genes in bacteria. the fimcba operon of streptococcus parasanguinis fw213 encodes a mn2+/fe2+-specific atp-binding cassette transporter. fima, a lipoprotein in the system, is essential for the development of endocarditis, presumably by binding to fibrin monolayers on the damaged heart tissue. recent sequence analysis revealed that spaf_0344 was homologous to streptococcus gordonii scar, encoding a metalloregulatory protein for the sca mn2+-specific transporter. based on the homology, spaf_0344 was designated fimr. by using various fim promoter (p fim ) derivatives fused with a  promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene, the functions of the cis-elements of p fim were analyzed in the wild-type and fimr-deficient hosts. the result indicated that fimr represses the expression of p fim and the palindromic sequences 5' to fimc are involved in repression of p fim . a direct interaction between fimr and the palindromic sequences was further confirmed by in vitro electrophoresis gel mobility shift assay and in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (chip)-quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr). the result of the chip-qpcr analysis also indicated that fimr is activated by mn2+ and, to a lesser degree, fe2+. functional analysis indicated that the expression of fima in s. parasanguinis was critical for wild-type levels of survival against oxidative  stress and within phagocytes, but not for acid tolerance. taken together, in addition to acting as an adhesin (fima), the expression of the fim operon is critical for the pathogenic capacity of s. parasanguinis.

TI  == a consortium of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus parasanguinis, and filifactor alocis is present in sites prior to bone loss in a  longitudinal study of localized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-induced localized aggressive periodontitis  (lap) in african-american adolescents has been documented but is poorly understood. two thousand fifty-eight adolescents aged 11 to 17 years were screened for their periodontal status and the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans in their oral cavity. seventy-one a. actinomycetemcomitans-negative and 63 a. actinomycetemcomitans-positive periodontally healthy subjects were enrolled, sampled, examined, and radiographed yearly for 3 years. gingival and periodontal pocket depth and attachment levels were recorded. disease presentation was characterized by bone loss (bl). subgingival sites were sampled every 6 months to assess (i) the role of a. actinomycetemcomitans in bl and (ii) the association of a. actinomycetemcomitans  and other microbes in their relationships to bl. sixteen of 63 subjects with a. actinomycetemcomitans developed bl (the other 47 subjects with a. actinomycetemcomitans had no bl). no a. actinomycetemcomitans-negative subjects developed bl. human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) was used for subgingival microbial assessment. on a subject level, pooled data from a. actinomycetemcomitans-positive subjects who remained healthy had higher prevalences of streptococcus and actinomyces species, while a. actinomycetemcomitans-positive subjects with bl had higher prevalences of parvimonas micra, filifactor alocis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and peptostreptococcus sp. human oral taxon 113 (hot-113). at vulnerable sites, a. actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus parasanguinis, and f. alocis levels were elevated prior to bl. in cases where the three-organism consortium (versus a. actinomycetemcomitans alone) was detected, the specificity for detecting sites of future bl increased from 62% to 99%, with a sensitivity of 89%. we conclude that  detecting the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, s. parasanguinis, and f. alocis together indicates sites of future bl in lap. a synergistic interaction of this consortium in lap causation is possible and is the subject of ongoing research.

TI  == preliminary x-ray crystallographic studies of an n-terminal domain of unknown function from a putative glycosyltransferase from streptococcus parasanguinis.
AB  == serine-rich repeat glycoproteins (srrps) belong to a growing family of bacterial  adhesins; they play important roles in bacterial virulence. fap1, the first srrp  protein to be identified, is glycosylated; while the first two steps of its glycosylation have been determined, the remaining glycosylation steps are unknown. in a search for proteins that might be relevant to the glycosylation of  fap1, a putative glycosyltransferase (galt1) from streptococcus parasanguinis was identified. galt1 possesses a domain of unknown function at the n-terminus. this  domain is highly conserved in bacteria and is a member of a broad superfamily. however, the structure of this domain has not been determined. here, the conditions used to produce a recombinant version of this protein domain and to grow protein crystals are reported. the crystals obtained belonged to space group c2, with unit-cell parameters a = 71.0, b = 45.1, c = 78.6 a, beta = 109.6 degrees , and diffracted to 1.55 a resolution at a synchrotron x-ray source. this domain does not share sequence identity with proteins of known structures above a level of 12%.

AB  == molecular and cultivation approaches were employed to study the phylogenetic richness and temporal dynamics of streptococcus and veillonella populations in the small intestine. microbial profiling of human small intestinal samples collected from four ileostomy subjects at four time points displayed abundant populations of streptococcus spp. most affiliated with s. salivarius, s. thermophilus, and s. parasanguinis, as well as veillonella spp. affiliated with v. atypica, v. parvula, v. dispar, and v. rogosae. relative abundances varied per subject and time of sampling. streptococcus and veillonella isolates were cultured using selective media from ileostoma effluent samples collected at two time points from a single subject. the richness of the streptococcus and veillonella isolates was assessed at species and strain level by 16s rrna gene sequencing and genetic fingerprinting, respectively. a total of 160 streptococcus and 37 veillonella isolates were obtained. genetic fingerprinting differentiated  seven streptococcus lineages from ileostoma effluent, illustrating the strain richness within this ecosystem. the veillonella isolates were represented by a single phylotype. our study demonstrated that the small intestinal streptococcus  populations displayed considerable changes over time at the genetic lineage level because only representative strains of a single streptococcus lineage could be cultivated from ileostoma effluent at both time points.

TI  == gap2 promotes the formation of a stable protein complex required for mature fap1  biogenesis.
AB  == serine-rich repeat glycoproteins (srrps) are important bacterial adhesins conserved in streptococci and staphylococci. fap1, a srrp identified in streptococcus parasanguinis, is the major constituent of bacterial fimbriae and is required for adhesion and biofilm formation. an 11-gene cluster is required for fap1 glycosylation and secretion; however, the exact mechanism of fap1 biogenesis remains a mystery. two glycosylation-associated proteins within this cluster--gap1 and gap3--function together in fap1 biogenesis. here we report the  role of the third glycosylation-associated protein, gap2. a gap2 mutant exhibited the same phenotype as the gap1 and gap3 mutants in terms of fap1 biogenesis, fimbrial assembly, and bacterial adhesion, suggesting that the three proteins interact. indeed, all three proteins interacted with each other independently and together to form a stable protein complex. mechanistically, gap2 protected gap3 from degradation by clpp protease, and gap2 required the presence of gap1 for expression at the wild-type level. gap2 augmented the function of gap1 in stabilizing gap3; this function was conserved in gap homologs from streptococcus  agalactiae. our studies demonstrate that the three gap proteins work in concert in fap1 biogenesis and reveal a new function of gap2. this insight will help us elucidate the molecular mechanism of srrp biogenesis in this bacterium and in pathogenic species.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of the synthetic peptide lys-a1 against oral streptococci.
AB  == the peptide lys-[trp(6)]-hy-a1 (lys-a1) is a synthetic derivative of the peptide  hy-a1, initially isolated from the frog species hypsiboas albopunctatus. according to previous research, it is a molecule with broad antimicrobial activity. the objective of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity  of the synthetic peptide lys-a1 (kifgaiwplalgalknlik-nh2) on the planktonic and biofilm growth of oral bacteria. the methods used to evaluate antimicrobial activity include the following: determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) in microtiter plates for growth in suspension and quantification of biomass by crystal violet staining and counting of colony forming units for biofilm growth. the microorganisms streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus were grown in brain heart infusion broth at 37 degrees c under atmospheric pressure with 10% co2. the peptide was solubilized in 0.1% acetic acid (v/v) at various concentrations (500-1.9 mug ml(-1)). chlorhexidine gluconate 0.12% was used as the positive control, and bhi culture medium was used as the negative control. the tested peptide demonstrated a remarkable antimicrobial effect, inhibiting the planktonic and biofilm growth of all strains tested, even at low concentrations. thus, the peptide lys-a1 is an important source for potential antimicrobial agents, especially for the control and prevention of microbial biofilms, which is one of the most important factors in cariogenic processes.

AB  == objective: microorganisms harboring the oral cavity, mainly those related to periodontal diseases, are the most potential etiologic factor of failure in long-term implant treatment. the material used for abutment components may influence the adhesion and colonization of microbial species. the aim of this in  vivo investigation was to evaluate the biofilm formation on machined (mpt) or cast titanium (cpt) and zirconia abutments (zc). methods: six healthy subjects were enrolled in this randomized crossover clinical investigation. the study was  conducted in three phases according to abutment surface evaluated. each subject used an individual oral splint containing four disks of the same tested substrate, two located in the anterior and two in the posterior region, totalizing 12 specimens for subject. participants were asked to use the removable intraoral splint during 24 h. dna checkerboard hybridization method was used to identify and quantify 38 bacterial species colonizing formed biofilm on the abutment substrates. results: pathogens and non-pathogens species were found colonizing the three substrates surfaces. fusobacterium nucleatum, neisseria mucosa, porphyromonas aeruginosa, peptostreptococcus anaerobios, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus parasanguinis, and tanerella forsythia were the only species with no significant differences over the tested materials (p > 0.05). all the other target species presented significant differences sought by friedman test (p < 0.0001). conclusions: there was a significant difference in the total bacterial count between the three groups. cpt presented the higher mean counts, followed by mpt and zc. cpt group also showed a higher mean incidence of species than mpt and zc. the anterior or posterior region of disks placement did not show significant differences in relation to bacterial adhesion.

TI  == fastannotator--an efficient transcript annotation web tool.
AB  == background: recent developments in high-throughput sequencing (hts) technologies  have made it feasible to sequence the complete transcriptomes of non-model organisms or metatranscriptomes from environmental samples. the challenge after generating hundreds of millions of sequences is to annotate these transcripts and classify the transcripts based on their putative functions. because many biological scientists lack the knowledge to install linux-based software packages or maintain databases used for transcript annotation, we developed an automatic annotation tool with an easy-to-use interface. methods: to elucidate the potential functions of gene transcripts, we integrated well-established annotation tools: blast2go, priam and rps blast in a web-based service, fastannotator, which can assign gene ontology (go) terms, enzyme commission numbers (ec numbers) and functional domains to query sequences. results: using six transcriptome sequence datasets as examples, we demonstrated the ability of fastannotator to assign functional annotations. fastannotator annotated 88.1% and 81.3% of the transcripts from the well-studied organisms caenorhabditis elegans and streptococcus parasanguinis, respectively. furthermore, fastannotator annotated 62.9%, 20.4%, 53.1% and 42.0% of the sequences from the transcriptomes  of sweet potato, clam, amoeba, and trichomonas vaginalis, respectively, which lack reference genomes. we demonstrated that fastannotator can complete the annotation process in a reasonable amount of time and is suitable for the annotation of transcriptomes from model organisms or organisms for which annotated reference genomes are not avaiable. conclusions: the sequencing process no longer represents the bottleneck in the study of genomics, and automatic annotation tools have become invaluable as the annotation procedure has become the limiting step. we present fastannotator, which was an automated annotation web tool designed to efficiently annotate sequences with their gene functions, enzyme functions or domains. fastannotator is useful in transcriptome studies and especially for those focusing on non-model organisms or metatranscriptomes. fastannotator does not require local installation and is freely available at http://fastannotator.cgu.edu.tw.

TI  == pancreatic pseudocyst after endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration of pancreatic mass.
AB  == endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (eus-fna) is well known as a  safe diagnostic procedure. we report the first case of pancreatic pseudocyst after eus-fna of the pancreatic body mass. a 60-year-old male underwent eus-fna for incidentally detected pancreatic solid mass which was suspected as neuroendocrine tumor. two weeks later, the patient visited emergency room with acute abdominal pain and right upper quadrant tenderness; leukocytosis and elevated c-reactive protein, amylase, and lipase levels were noted. computed tomography discovered newly developed 11.5x9.5 cm sized cystic mass communicating with the main pancreatic duct. cyst fluid analysis revealed amylase level of 3,423 u/l and fluid culture isolated streptococcus parasanguinis. the cystic mass corresponds with pancreatic pseudocyst. fna induced main pancreatic duct injury and fluid leakage may cause it. endoscopists who perform eus-fna must remember that pancreatic main duct injury can occur as one of severe complications and that it could be treated successfully with endoscopic internal drainage.

TI  == beyond streptococcus mutans: dental caries onset linked to multiple species by 16s rrna community analysis.
AB  == dental caries in very young children may be severe, result in serious infection,  and require general anesthesia for treatment. dental caries results from a shift  within the biofilm community specific to the tooth surface, and acidogenic species are responsible for caries. streptococcus mutans, the most common acid producer in caries, is not always present and occurs as part of a complex microbial community. understanding the degree to which multiple acidogenic species provide functional redundancy and resilience to caries-associated communities will be important for developing biologic interventions. in addition, microbial community interactions in health and caries pathogenesis are not well understood. the purpose of this study was to investigate bacterial community profiles associated with the onset of caries in the primary dentition. in a combination cross-sectional and longitudinal design, bacterial community profiles at progressive stages of caries and over time were examined and compared to those of health. 16s rrna gene sequencing was used for bacterial community analysis. streptococcus mutans was the dominant species in many, but not all, subjects with caries. elevated levels of s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, and s. parasanguinis were  also associated with caries, especially in subjects with no or low levels of s. mutans, suggesting these species are alternative pathogens, and that multiple species may need to be targeted for interventions. veillonella, which metabolizes lactate, was associated with caries and was highly correlated with total acid producing species. among children without previous history of caries, veillonella, but not s. mutans or other acid-producing species, predicted future  caries. bacterial community diversity was reduced in caries as compared to health, as many species appeared to occur at lower levels or be lost as caries advanced, including the streptococcus mitis group, neisseria, and streptococcus sanguinis. this may have implications for bacterial community resilience and the  restoration of oral health.

TI  == occurrence and evolution of the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  == the distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd, in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. zmpb was ubiquitous in the mitis and salivarius groups of the genus streptococcus and in the genera gemella and granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented  gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. iga1 protease activity was observed in all members of s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae, s. oralis, s. sanguinis, and gemella haemolysans, was variably  present in s. mitis and s. infantis, and absent in s. gordonii, s. parasanguinis, s. cristatus, s. oligofermentans, s. australis, s. peroris, and s. suis. phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes  provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpb, and zmpd genes in s. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. the widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpb, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is  likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. importance: the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae. this study maps the presence of the  corresponding genes and enzyme activities in s. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera streptococcus, gemella, and granulicatella. the distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpb is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. the zmpb  protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the mitis and salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. the relative sequence  diversification of the iga1 protease, zmpb, and zmpd is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen s. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.

TI  == uv-c-irradiation sublethal stress does not alter antibiotic susceptibility of the viridans group streptococci to beta-lactam, macrolide, and fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents.
AB  == aim: previous work has indicated that environmental stresses on bacteria might lead to an upregulation of stress response. led curing lights (315-400 nm) and other uv lights used in tooth whitening cosmetic procedures might act as stresses. we examined the effect of uv-c light, as a high-energy surrogate to the lower-energy uv-a light used in such instruments, to examine its effect on the antibiotic susceptibility of viridans group streptococci. methods: twelve species of viridans group streptococci were examined in this study: streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus australis, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis. these organisms were exposed to varying degrees of sublethal uv-c radiation, and their minimum inhibitory concentration susceptibility was determined by broth dilution assay against three classes of commonly-used antibiotics: beta-lactams (penicillin), macrolides (erythromycin), and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin). results: there was no significant difference between antibiotic susceptibility before uv-c exposure and following maximum sublethal stress, prior to cell death due to fatal uv-c exposure. conclusions: exposure to uv-c light will not result in altered antibiotic susceptibility patterns on viridans group streptococci. given that uv-c is more toxic and mutagenic than uv-a light, it is unlikely than uv-a light  would yield any difference in response to such exposure.

TI  == comparison of oral microbiota in tumor and non-tumor tissues of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma.
AB  == background: bacterial infections have been linked to malignancies due to their ability to induce chronic inflammation. we investigated the association of oral bacteria in oral squamous cell carcinoma (oscc/tumor) tissues and compared with adjacent non-tumor mucosa sampled 5 cm distant from the same patient (n = 10). by using culture-independent 16s rrna approaches, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and cloning and sequencing, we assessed the total bacterial diversity in these clinical samples. results: dgge fingerprints showed  variations in the band intensity profiles within non-tumor and tumor tissues of the same patient and among the two groups. the clonal analysis indicated that from a total of 1200 sequences characterized, 80 bacterial species/phylotypes were detected representing six phyla, firmicutes, bacteroidetes, proteobacteria,  fusobacteria, actinobacteria and uncultivated tm7 in non-tumor and tumor libraries. in combined library, 12 classes, 16 order, 26 families and 40 genera were observed. bacterial species, streptococcus sp. oral taxon 058, peptostreptococcus stomatis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus gordonii, gemella haemolysans, gemella morbillorum, johnsonella ignava and streptococcus parasanguinis i were highly associated with tumor site where as granulicatella adiacens was prevalent at non-tumor site. streptococcus intermedius was present in 70% of both non-tumor and tumor sites. conclusions: the underlying changes in  the bacterial diversity in the oral mucosal tissues from non-tumor and tumor sites of oscc subjects indicated a shift in bacterial colonization. these most prevalent or unique bacterial species/phylotypes present in tumor tissues may be  associated with oscc and needs to be further investigated with a larger sample size.

TI  == complete genome and transcriptomes of streptococcus parasanguinis fw213: phylogenic relations and potential virulence mechanisms.
AB  == streptococcus parasanguinis, a primary colonizer of the tooth surface, is also an opportunistic pathogen for subacute endocarditis. the complete genome of strain fw213 was determined using the traditional shotgun sequencing approach and further refined by the transcriptomes of cells in early exponential and early stationary growth phases in this study. the transcriptomes also discovered 10 transcripts encoding known hypothetical proteins, one pseudogene, five transcripts matched to the rfam and additional 87 putative small rnas within the  intergenic regions defined by the glimmer analysis. the genome contains five acquired genomic islands (gis) encoding proteins which potentially contribute to  the overall pathogenic capacity and fitness of this microbe. the differential expression of the gis and various open reading frames outside the gis at the two  growth phases suggested that fw213 possess a range of mechanisms to avoid host immune clearance, to colonize host tissues, to survive within oral biofilms and to overcome various environmental insults. furthermore, the comparative genome analysis of five s. parasanguinis strains indicates that albeit s. parasanguinis  strains are highly conserved, variations in the genome content exist. these variations may reflect differences in pathogenic potential between the strains.

TI  == gap1 functions as a molecular chaperone to stabilize its interactive partner gap3 during biogenesis of serine-rich repeat bacterial adhesin.
AB  == serine-rich repeat glycoproteins (srrps) are important bacterial adhesins that are conserved in streptococci and staphylococci. fimbriae-associated protein (fap1) from streptococcus parasanguinis, was the first srrp identified; it plays  an important role in bacterial biofilm formation. a gene cluster encoding glycosyltransferases and accessory secretion components is required for fap1 biogenesis. two glycosylation-associated proteins, gap1 and gap3 within the cluster, interact with each other and function in concert in fap1 biogenesis. here we report the new molecular events underlying contribution of the interaction to fap1 biogenesis. the gap1-deficient mutant rendered gap3 unstable  and degraded in vitro and in vivo. inactivation of a gene encoding protease clpp  reversed the phenotype of the gap1 mutant, suggesting that clpp is responsible for degradation of gap3. molecular chaperone groel was co-purified with gap3 only when gap1 was absent and also reacted with gap1 monoclonal antibody, suggesting that gap1 functions as a specific chaperone for gap3. the n-terminal interacting  domains of gap1 mediated the gap3 stability and fap1 biogenesis. gap1 homologues  from streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus also interacted with and  stabilized corresponding gap3 homologues, suggesting that the chaperone activity  of the gap1 homologues is common in biogenesis of srrps.

TI  == structural insight into the role of streptococcus parasanguinis fap1 within oral  biofilm formation.
AB  == the fimbriae-associated protein 1 (fap1) is a major adhesin of streptococcus parasanguinis, a primary colonizer of the oral cavity that plays an important role in the formation of dental plaque. fap1 is an extracellular adhesive surface fibre belonging to the serine-rich repeat protein (srrp) family, which plays a central role in the pathogenesis of streptococci and staphylococci. the n-terminal adhesive region of fap1 (fap1-nr) is composed of two domains (fap1-nr(alpha) and fap1-nr(beta)) and is projected away from the bacterial surface via the extensive serine-rich repeat region, for adhesion to the salivary pellicle. the adhesive properties of fap1 are modulated through a ph switch in which a reduction in ph results in a rearrangement between the fap1-nr(alpha) and fap1-nr(beta) domains, which assists in the survival of s. parasanguinis in acidic environments. we have solved the structure of fap1-nr(alpha) at ph 5.0 at  3.0a resolution and reveal how subtle rearrangements of the 3-helix bundle combined with a change in electrostatic potential mediates 'opening' and activation of the adhesive region. further, we show that ph-dependent changes are critical for biofilm formation and present an atomic model for the inter-fap1-nr  interactions which have been assigned an important role in the biofilm formation.

TI  == canonical seca associates with an accessory secretory protein complex involved in biogenesis of a streptococcal serine-rich repeat glycoprotein.
AB  == fap1, a serine-rich repeat glycoprotein (srrp), is required for bacterial biofilm formation of streptococcus parasanguinis. fap1-like srrps are found in many gram-positive bacteria and have been implicated in bacterial fitness and virulence. a conserved five-gene cluster, secy2-gap1-gap2-gap3-seca2, located immediately downstream of fap1, is required for fap1 biogenesis. seca2, gap1, and gap3 encode three putative accessory sec proteins. seca2 mediates export of mature fap1, and gap1 and gap3 are required for fap1 biogenesis. interestingly, gap1 and gap3 mutants exhibited the same phenotype as a seca2 mutant, implying that gap1 and gap3 may interact with seca2 to mediate fap1 biogenesis. glutathione s-transferase pulldown experiments revealed a direct interaction between seca2, gap1, and gap3 in vitro. coimmunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated the formation of a seca2-gap1-gap3 complex. homologues of seca2, gap1, and gap3 are conserved in many streptococci and staphylococci. the corresponding homologues from streptococcus agalactiae also interacted with each  other and formed a protein complex. furthermore, the gap1 homologues from s. agalactiae and streptococcus sanguinis rescued the fap1 defect in the gap1 mutant, indicating the functional conservation of the accessory sec complex. importantly, canonical seca interacted with the accessory sec protein complex, suggesting that the biogenesis of srrps mediated by the accessory sec system is linked to the canonical sec system.

TI  == molecular characterisation of the quinolone resistance-determining region (qrdr)  of the parc gene locus in viridans-group streptococci.
AB  == forty-eight isolates of viridans-group streptococci (vgs) from adults and children in the community are examined for their resistance to ciprofloxacin phenotypically by determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic). in addition, the parc gene locus is amplified and sequenced in all isolates and mutations noted. overall, 44 vgs organisms were found to be susceptible to ciprofloxacin by the broth microdilution method, and the remaining four strains had intermediate susceptibility. reduced mics were observed with intermediate strains when reserpine was added to the broth, inhibiting any efflux activity. overall, the effect of adding reserpine to the broth medium was to add one doubling dilution to the mic in the case of streptococcus mitis, s. oralis and s. salivarius, as well as to increase the mic by two doubling dilutions in two of the three s. parasanguinis isolates. amino acid sequence analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining region (qrdr) of the parc gene locus showed good correlation to the phenotypic resistance to ciprofloxacin, where no confirmed mutation conferring quinolone resistance was found. eleven amino acid positions showed discordance with s. pneumoniae r6 and eight (s52, f55, s58, n91, e135, k137, f141 and s167) were common in the vgs species examined. in addition, minor  substitutions were found at three positions (d51, t54 and v86). in conclusion, this study demonstrates the low occurrence of ciprofloxacin resistance in a population of vgs isolated from the community. in addition, several silent mutations were noted in vgs organisms without any increase in mic against ciprofloxacin.

TI  == microbiota of severe early childhood caries before and after therapy.
AB  == severe early childhood caries (ecc) is difficult to treat successfully. this study aimed to characterize the microbiota of severe ecc and evaluate whether baseline or follow-up microbiotas are associated with new lesions post-treatment. plaque samples from 2- to 6-year-old children were analyzed by a 16s rrna-based microarray and by pcr for selected taxa. severe-ecc children were monitored for 12 months post-therapy. by microarray, species associated with severe-ecc (n = 53) compared with caries-free (n = 32) children included slackia exigua (p = 0.002), streptococcus parasanguinis (p = 0.013), and prevotella species (p < 0.02). by pcr, severe-ecc-associated taxa included bifidobacteriaceae (p < 0.001), scardovia wiggsiae (p = 0.003), streptococcus mutans with bifidobacteria  (p < 0.001), and s. mutans with s. wiggsiae (p = 0.001). in follow-up, children without new lesions (n = 36) showed lower detection of taxa including s. mutans,  changes not observed in children with follow-up lesions (n = 17). partial least-squares modeling separated the children into caries-free and two severe-ecc groups with either a stronger bacterial or a stronger dietary component. we conclude that several species, including s. wiggsiae and s. exigua, are associated with the ecology of advanced caries, that successful treatment is accompanied by a change in the microbiota, and that severe ecc is diverse, with influences from selected bacteria or from diet.

TI  == a molecular chaperone mediates a two-protein enzyme complex and glycosylation of  serine-rich streptococcal adhesins.
AB  == serine-rich repeat glycoproteins identified from streptococci and staphylococci are important for bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation. two putative glycosyltransferases, gtf1 and gtf2, from streptococcus parasanguinis form a two-protein enzyme complex that is required for glycosylation of a serine-rich repeat adhesin, fap1. gtf1 is a glycosyltransferase; however, the function of gtf2 is unknown. here, we demonstrate that gtf2 enhances the enzymatic activity of gtf1 by its chaperone-like property. gtf2 interacted with gtf1, mediated the subcellular localization of gtf1, and stabilized gtf1. deletion of invariable amino acid residues in a conserved domain of unknown function (duf1975) at the n  terminus of gtf2 had a greater impact on fap1 glycosylation than deletion of the  c-terminal non-duf1975 residues. the duf1975 deletions concurrently reduced the interaction between gtf1 and gtf2, altered the subcellular localization of gtf1,  and destabilized gtf1, suggesting that duf1975 is crucial for the chaperone activity of gtf2. homologous gtfa and gtfb from streptococcus agalactiae rescued  the glycosylation defect in the gtf1gtf2 mutant; like gtf2, gtfb also possesses chaperone-like activity. taken together, our studies suggest that gtf2 and its homologs possess the conserved molecular chaperone activity that mediates protein glycosylation of bacterial adhesins.

TI  == structural and functional analysis of a new subfamily of glycosyltransferases required for glycosylation of serine-rich streptococcal adhesins.
AB  == serine-rich repeat glycoproteins (srrps) are a growing family of bacterial adhesins found in many streptococci and staphylococci; they play important roles  in bacterial biofilm formation and pathogenesis. glycosylation of this family of  adhesins is essential for their biogenesis. a glucosyltransferase (gtf3) catalyzes the second step of glycosylation of a srrp (fap1) from an oral streptococcus, streptococcus parasanguinis. although gtf3 homologs are highly conserved in srrp-containing streptococci, they share minimal homology with functionally known glycosyltransferases. we report here the 2.3 a crystal structure of gtf3. the structural analysis indicates that gtf3 forms a tetramer and shares significant structural homology with glycosyltransferases from gt4, gt5, and gt20 subfamilies. combining crystal structural analysis with site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro glycosyltransferase assays, we identified  residues that are required for udp- or udp-glucose binding and for oligomerization of gtf3 and determined their contribution to the enzymatic activity of gtf3. further in vivo studies revealed that the critical amino acid residues identified by the structural analysis are crucial for fap1 glycosylation in s. parasanguinis in vivo. moreover, gtf3 homologs from other streptococci were able to rescue the gtf3 knock-out mutant of s. parasanguinis in vivo and catalyze the sugar transfer to the modified srrp substrate in vitro, demonstrating the importance and conservation of the gtf3 homologs in glycosylation of srrps. as the gtf3 homologs only exist in srrp-containing streptococci, we conclude that the gtf3 homologs represent a unique subfamily of glycosyltransferases.

TI  == new cell surface protein involved in biofilm formation by streptococcus parasanguinis.
AB  == dental biofilm formation is critical for maintaining the healthy microbial ecology of the oral cavity. streptococci are predominant bacterial species in the oral cavity and play important roles in the initiation of plaque formation. in this study, we identified a new cell surface protein, bapa1, from streptococcus parasanguinis fw213 and determined that bapa1 is critical for biofilm formation.  sequence analysis revealed that bapa1 possesses a typical cell wall-sorting signal for cell surface-anchored proteins from gram-positive bacteria. no functional orthologue was reported in other streptococci. bapa1 possesses nine putative pilin isopeptide linker domains which are crucial for pilus assembly in  a number of gram-positive bacteria. deletion of the 3' portion of bapa1 generated a mutant that lacks surface-anchored bapa1 and abolishes formation of short fibrils on the cell surface. the mutant failed to form biofilms and exhibited reduced adherence to an in vitro tooth model. the bapa1 deficiency also inhibited bacterial autoaggregation. the n-terminal muramidase-released-protein-like domain mediated bapa1-bapa1 interactions, suggesting that bapa1-mediated cell-cell interactions are important for bacterial autoaggregation and biofilm formation. furthermore, the bapa1-mediated bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation are independent of a fimbria-associated serine-rich repeat adhesin, fap1, demonstrating that bapa1 is a new streptococcal adhesin.

TI  == properties and construction of plasmid pfw213, a shuttle vector with the oral streptococcus origin of replication.
AB  == streptococcus parasanguinis is among the most successful colonizers of the human  body. strain fw213 harbors a 7.0-kb cryptic plasmid, pfw213, with a copy number at 5 to 10 per chromosome. sequence and functional analyses of pfw213 revealed that the open reading frame (orf) encoding the replication protein (rep) is essential for the replication of pfw213, and the putative plasmid addiction system (relb and rele) and an orf (orf6) with no known function are required for  its stability. the minimal replicon of pfw213 contains the rep gene and its 5'-flanking 390-bp region. within the minimal replicon, an a/t-rich region followed by 5 contiguous 22-bp repeats was located 5' of the atg of rep. no single-stranded replication intermediates were detected in the derivatives of pfw213, suggesting that pfw213 replicates via the theta replication mechanism. the minimal replicon was unstable in streptococcal hosts without selection, but the stability was greatly enhanced in derivatives containing the intact relbe genes. a streptococcus-escherichia coli shuttle vector, pcg1, was constructed with the pfw213 replicon. plasmid pcg1 features a multiple cloning region and a spectinomycin resistance determinant that is expressed in both streptococcus spp. and e. coli. various streptococcal dna fragments were cloned in pcg1, and the recombinant constructs were stably maintained in the streptococcal hosts. since pcg1 is compatible with the most widely used streptococcal replicon, pva380-1, pcg1 will provide a much needed tool allowing the cloning of two genes that work  in concert in the same host.

AB  == the oral cavity contains the greatest biodiversity, over 70 species being isolated from mouth mucosa, saliva, denture surfaces and/or dental-plaque. the oral streptococci, representing over 80% of the mouth micro flora, are able to synthesize glucosyl-transferases, enzymes involved in glucans production. glucans are involved in production of an extracellular slime layer promoting adhesion and formation of a dental plaque biofilm. the 43 isolates studied obtained from partially and/or totally edentulous, were identified by vitek system using gram-positive identification cards. species-specific regions within the genes coding for glucosyl-transferases (gtf genes) were targeted for pcr identification of isolates. sequencing of 16s rrna was used as gold standard for strain confirmation. vitek system identified a number of 11 strains as s. mitis/oralis,  12 strains as s. anginosus/gordonii, 12 strains as s. sanguinis/parasanguinis, 3  strains as s. salivarius, 3 strains as s. plurianimalium, 1 strain as s. cristatus and 1 strain as s. alactolyticus, respectively. the pcr system targeting gtf genes was able to identify s. oralis, s. salivarius and s. gordonii strains. sequence of 16s rrna discriminated among streptococci species and revealed 16 strains of leuconostoc mesenteroides. many studies are needed in order to select the most reliable phenotypic and genotypic methods in order to improve the identification algorithm for oral streptococci used by clinical laboratories. their accurate identification is mandatory for better understanding their role in human infections.

AB  == objectives: ciprofloxacin is the most frequently used member of the fluoroquinolones during initial eradication therapy of pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as during acute pulmonary exacerbations. however, its long-term effect on the susceptibility of the commensal flora within the cystic fibrosis (cf) airways has not yet been examined. the aim of this study was therefore to examine the consequence of oral ciprofloxacin usage on the resistance of the commensal viridans group streptococci (vgs), in terms of mics and mutational analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs). methods: the mics of ciprofloxacin, efflux activities and amino acid substitutions in the qrdrs for 190 isolates of vgs, originating from the sputa of adult cf patients who had been exposed constantly to ciprofloxacin, were examined. vgs organisms included streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus australis and streptococcus mutans. ciprofloxacin susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution and qrdrs within the gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci were explored using sequence analysis. results: twenty-seven (14.2%) streptococcal isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (mics >/=8 mg/l) and 21 (11.1%) had reduced susceptibility (mics 4 mg/l). as a comparator, clinically non-significant and non-invasive vgs organisms were examined in 12 consecutive non-cf patients in the community, where no resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed. five novel qrdr pcr assays were developed to elucidate mutations within the cf vgs population, where there were six positions, which corresponded to previously reported quinolone resistance responsible mutations, and eight novel potential qrdr resistance mutations. double mutations  in gyra and parc/pare led to mics of 16 to >64 mg/l, while single mutations in parc or pare resulted in mics of 8-32 mg/l and 8 mg/l, respectively. the mean homologies of each species to streptococcus pneumoniae r6 were: gyra, 70.3%-95%;  gyrb, 69.6%-96.2%; parc, 76.1%-94.8%; and pare, 70.7%-94.7%. the close relatives  of s. pneumoniae, s. mitis and s. oralis, showed high similarity for all four genes (more than 86%). conclusions: treatment of p. aeruginosa with oral ciprofloxacin in patients with cf may concurrently reduce antibiotic susceptibility in the commensal vgs flora, where these organisms may potentially  act as a reservoir of fluoroquinolone resistance gene determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens, particularly the streptococcus milleri group.

TI  == population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (vgs) including streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf).
AB  == a study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (vgs) in the sputum of adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf). freshly expectorated sputa (n=58) from 45 adult cf patients were examined by selective conventional culture on mitis-salivarius agar and yielded 190 isolates  of vgs. sequence analyses of the rpnb and 16-23s rrna its genes identified these  isolates to belong to 12 species of vgs and included s. anginosus, s. australis,  s. cristatus, s. gordonii, s. infantis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. pneumoniae, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis. the most frequently vgs organism isolated was s. salivarius (47/190; 24.7%), followed by s. mitis (36/190; 19%), s. sanguinis (25/190; 13.2%), s. oralis (20/190; 11.0%), s. pneumoniae (19/190; 10.0%), s. parasanguinis (16/190; 8.4%), s. infantis (11/190; 5.8%), s. gordonii (7/190; 3.7%), s. anginosus (4/190; 2.1%), s. cristatus (2/190; 1.1%), s. australis (1/190; 0.5%), s. mutans (1/190; 0.5%) and s. agalactiae (1/190; 0.5%). all, but four, patients harboured at least one vgs species, which ranged from one to five streptococcal species, with a mean of 2.85 species per patient. there was no clonality at the subspecies level employing eric rapd pcr. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) testing against penicillin, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. overall, resistance to penicillin with all vgs was 73/190 (38.4%) and 167/190 (87.9%) for erythromycin. with regard to ciprofloxacin, 27/190 (14.2%) were fully resistant, whilst a further 21/190 (11.1%) showed intermediate resistance, which  equated to approximately three quarters (74.7%) of isolates being fully sensitive to this agent. in addition, as a comparator control population, we examined antibiotic susceptibility, as above, in a non-cf population comprising 12 individuals (50 vgs isolates), who were not receiving chronic antibiotics. in comparison, 8% and 38% of vgs isolates from non-cf individuals were resistant by  disk susceptibility testing to penicillin and erythromycin, respectively. none of the non-cf vgs organisms were resistant to ciprofloxacin, but 42% showed intermediate resistance.

TI  == purification and characterization of an active n-acetylglucosaminyltransferase enzyme complex from streptococci.
AB  == a new family of bacterial serine-rich repeat glycoproteins can function as adhesins required for biofilm formation and pathogenesis in streptococci and staphylococci. biogenesis of these proteins depends on a gene cluster coding for  glycosyltransferases and accessory secretion proteins. previous studies show that fap1, a member of this family from streptococcus parasanguinis, can be glycosylated by a protein glycosylation complex in a recombinant heterogeneous host. here we report a tandem affinity purification (tap) approach used to isolate and study protein complexes from native streptococci. this method demonstrated that a putative glycosyltransferase (gtf2), which is essential for fap1 glycosylation, readily copurified with another glycosyltransferase (gtf1) from native s. parasanguinis. this result and the similar isolation of a homologous two-protein complex from streptococcus pneumoniae indicate the biological relevance of the complexes to the glycosylation in streptococci. furthermore, novel n-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity was discovered for the complexes. optimal activity required heterodimer formation and appears to represent a novel type of glycosylation.

TI  == structural insights into serine-rich fimbriae from gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the serine-rich repeat family of fimbriae play important roles in the pathogenesis of streptococci and staphylococci. despite recent attention, their finer structural details and precise adhesion mechanisms have yet to be determined. fap1 (fimbriae-associated protein 1) is the major structural subunit  of serine-rich repeat fimbriae from streptococcus parasanguinis and plays an essential role in fimbrial biogenesis, adhesion, and the early stages of dental plaque formation. combining multidisciplinary, high resolution structural studies with biological assays, we provide new structural insight into adhesion by fap1.  we propose a model in which the serine-rich repeats of fap1 subunits form an extended structure that projects the n-terminal globular domains away from the bacterial surface for adhesion to the salivary pellicle. we also uncover a novel  ph-dependent conformational change that modulates adhesion and likely plays a role in survival in acidic environments.

TI  == a novel glucosyltransferase is required for glycosylation of a serine-rich adhesin and biofilm formation by streptococcus parasanguinis.
AB  == fap1-like serine-rich glycoproteins are conserved in streptococci, staphylococci, and lactobacilli, and are required for bacterial biofilm formation and pathogenesis. glycosylation of fap1 is mediated by a gene cluster flanking the fap1 locus. the key enzymes responsible for the first step of fap1 glycosylation  are glycosyltransferases gtf1 and gtf2. they form a functional enzyme complex that catalyzes the transfer of n-acetylglucosamine (glcnac) residues to the fap1  polypeptide. however, until now nothing was known about the subsequent step in fap1 glycosylation. here, we show that the second step in fap1 glycosylation is catalyzed by nucleotide-sugar synthetase-like (nss) protein. the nss gene located upstream of fap1 is also highly conserved in streptococci and lactobacilli. nss-deficient mutants failed to catalyze the second step of fap1 glycosylation in vivo in streptococcus parasanguinis and in a recombinant fap1 glycosylation system. nss catalyzed the direct transfer of the glucosyl residue to the glcnac-modified fap1 substrate in vitro, demonstrating that nss is a glucosyltransferase. thus we renamed nss as glucosyltransferase 3 (gtf3). a gtf3  mutant exhibited a biofilm defect. taken together, we conclude that this new glucosyltransferase mediates the second step of fap1 glycosylation and is required for biofilm formation.

TI  == molecular characterization of macrolide resistance determinants [erm(b) and mef(a)] in streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf).
AB  == objectives: although long-term use of azithromycin has shown a significant clinical improvement for patients with cystic fibrosis (cf), its long-term effect on the susceptibility of commensal flora within cf airways has not yet been examined. we therefore suggest that long-term use of azithromycin increases macrolide resistance in commensal streptococci. methods: erythromycin susceptibility in naturally colonizing viridans group streptococci (vgs) was characterized, as well as macrolide resistance gene determinants through sequence analysis, in pneumococci (n = 15) and vgs [n = 84; i.e. streptococcus salivarius  (n = 30), streptococcus mitis (n = 17), streptococcus sanguinis (n = 11), streptococcus oralis (n = 10), streptococcus parasanguinis (n = 6), streptococcus gordonii (n = 3), streptococcus infantis (n = 3), streptococcus cristatus (n = 2), streptococcus anginosus (n = 1) and streptococcus australis (n = 1)] isolated from sputum from 24 adult cf patients, who were on oral azithromycin therapy for  at least the previous 7 months. results: almost three-quarters of isolates (74; 74.7%) were resistant to erythromycin, whilst a further 15 (15.2%) had reduced susceptibility, leaving only 10 (10.1%) isolates susceptible to erythromycin. the majority (89.8%) were not susceptible to erythromycin, as demonstrated by possession of the erm(b) gene in 25/99 (25.3%), the mef(a) gene in 1/99 (1.0%), the mef(e) gene in 75/99 (75.8%) and both erm(b) and mef(e) genes simultaneously  in 11/99 (11.1%). these results indicate that genotypic resistance for macrolides is common in vgs in adult cf patients, with efflux being over three times more frequent. conclusions: long-term treatment with azithromycin in cf patients may reduce antibiotic susceptibility in commensal vgs, where these organisms may potentially act as a reservoir of macrolide resistance determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens.

TI  == glycosylation and biogenesis of a family of serine-rich bacterial adhesins.
AB  == glycosylation of bacterial proteins is an important process for bacterial physiology and pathophysiology. both o- and n-linked glycan moieties have been identified in bacterial glycoproteins. the n-linked glycosylation pathways are well established in gram-negative bacteria. however, the o-linked glycosylation pathways are not well defined due to the complex nature of known o-linked glycoproteins in bacteria. in this review, we examine a new family of serine-rich o-linked glycoproteins which are represented by fimbriae-associated adhesin fap1  of streptococcus parasanguinis and human platelet-binding protein gspb of streptococcus gordonii. this family of glycoproteins is conserved in streptococcal and staphylococcal species. a gene cluster coding for glycosyltransferases and accessory sec proteins has been implicated in the protein glycosylation. a two-step glycosylation model is proposed. two glycosyltransferases interact with each other and catalyse the first step of the  protein glycosylation in the cytoplasm; the cross-talk between glycosylation-associated proteins and accessory sec components mediates the second step of the protein glycosylation, an emerging mechanism for bacterial o-linked protein glycosylation. dissecting the molecular mechanism of this conserved biosynthetic pathway offers opportunities to develop new therapeutic strategies targeting this previously unrecognized pathway, as serine-rich glycoproteins have been shown to play a role in bacterial pathogenesis.

AB  == background: population analysis of viridans streptococci is important because these species are associated with dental caries, bacteremia, and subacute endocarditis, in addition to being important members of the human oral commensal  microbiota. design: in this study, we phylogenetically analyzed the rod shape-determining protein gene (roda), which is associated with cellular morphology, cell division, and sensitivity for antibiotics, and demonstrated that the diversity of the roda gene is sufficient to identify viridans streptococci at the species level. moreover, we developed a more convenient denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) method based on the diversity of the roda gene (roda-dgge) for detecting nine dominant streptococcal species in human saliva, namely, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus vestibularis,  streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sobrinus. results: this roda-dgge method proved useful in detecting viridans streptococci without cultivation, isolation, and phenotypic characterization. conclusion: analysis of the oral microbiota by roda-dgge offers a higher resolution than the  conventional dgge using 16s rdna and may be an alternative in the microbial diagnosis of streptococcal infection.

TI  == a conserved c-terminal 13-amino-acid motif of gap1 is required for gap1 function  and necessary for the biogenesis of a serine-rich glycoprotein of streptococcus parasanguinis.
AB  == adhesion of streptococcus parasanguinis to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sha), an in vitro tooth model, is mediated by long peritrichous fimbriae. fap1, a fimbria-associated serine-rich glycoprotein, is required for fimbrial assembly. biogenesis of fap1 is controlled by an 11-gene cluster that contains gly, nss, galt1 and -2, secy2, gap1 to -3, seca2, and gtf1 and -2. we had previously isolated a collection of nine nonadherent mutants using random chemical mutagenesis approaches. these mutants fail to adhere to the in vitro tooth model  and to form fimbriae. in this report, we further characterized these randomly selected nonadherent mutants and classified them into three distinct groups. two  groups of genes were previously implicated in fap1 biogenesis. one group has a mutation in a glycosyltransferase gene, gtf1, that is essential for the first step of fap1 glycosylation, whereas the other group has defects in the fap1 structural gene. the third group mutant produces an incompletely glycosylated fap1 and exhibits a mutant phenotype similar to that of a glycosylation-associated protein 1 (gap1) mutant. analysis of this new mutant revealed that a conserved c-terminal 13-amino-acid motif was missing in gap1. site-directed mutagenesis of a highly conserved amino acid tryptophan within this motif recapitulated the deletion phenotype, demonstrating the importance of the gap1 c-terminal motif for fap1 biogenesis. furthermore, the c-terminal mutation does not affect gap1-gap3 protein-protein interaction, which has been shown to mediate fap1 glycosylation, suggesting the c-terminal motif has a distinct function related to fap1 biogenesis.

TI  == a conserved domain of previously unknown function in gap1 mediates protein-protein interaction and is required for biogenesis of a serine-rich streptococcal adhesin.
AB  == fap1-like serine-rich proteins are a new family of bacterial adhesins found in a  variety of streptococci and staphylococci that have been implicated in bacterial  pathogenesis. a gene cluster encoding glycosyltransferases and accessory sec components is required for fap1 glycosylation and biogenesis in streptococcus parasanguinis. here we report that the glycosylation-associated protein, gap1, contributes to glycosylation and biogenesis of fap1 by interacting with another glycosylation-associated protein, gap3. gap1 shares structural homology with glycosyltransferases. the gap1 mutant, like the gap3 mutant, produced an aberrantly glycosylated fap1 precursor and failed to produce mature fap1, suggesting that gap1 and gap3 might function in concert in the fap1 glycosylation and biogenesis. indeed, gap1 interacted with gap3 in vitro and in vivo. a gap1 n-terminal motif, within a highly conserved domain of unknown function (duf1975)  identified in many bacterial glycosyltransferases, was required for the gap1-gap3 interaction. deletion of one, four and nine amino acids within the conserved motif gradually inhibited the gap1-gap3 interaction and diminished production of  mature fap1 and concurrently increased production of the fap1 precursor. consequently, bacterial adhesion to an in vitro tooth model was also reduced. these data demonstrate that the gap1-gap3 interaction is required for fap1 biogenesis and fap1-dependent bacterial adhesion.

TI  == a new twist on an old pathway--accessory sec [corrected] systems.
AB  == the export of proteins from their site of synthesis in the cytoplasm across the inner membrane is an important aspect of bacterial physiology. because the location of extracytoplasmic proteins is ideal for host-pathogen interactions, protein export is also important to bacterial virulence. in bacteria, there are conserved protein export systems that are responsible for the majority of protein export: the general secretion (sec) pathway and the twin-arginine translocation pathway. in some bacteria, there are also specialized export systems dedicated to exporting specific subsets of proteins. in this review, we discuss a specialized  export system that exists in some gram-positive bacteria and mycobacteria - the accessory sec system. the common element to the accessory sec system is an accessory seca protein called seca2. here we present our current understanding of accessory sec systems in streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus parasanguinis, mycobacterium smegmatis, mycobacterium tuberculosis and listeria monocytogenes, making an effort to highlight apparent similarities and differences between the systems. we also review the data showing that accessory sec systems can contribute to bacterial virulence.

TI  == antibacterial activity of yoghurt against viridans streptococci in vitro.
AB  == objective: yoghurt consumption leads to a selective decrease in the oral level of mutans streptococci. it is not clear whether this decrease is due to the bactericidal activity of yoghurt or other mechanisms. the present study investigated the differences in susceptibility to yoghurt between several strains of viridans streptococci. design: the sources of variation were minimised, at the expense of the external validity of the study, using culture collection strains.  each strain was tested separately on five occasions in planktonic form and logarithmic growth phase. two strains of each of the following streptococcus species were tested: mutans, sobrinus, gordonii, oralis, parasanguinis and sanguinis. one millilitre [10(8) colony-forming units (cfu)] of each strain was incubated (37 degrees c, 60min) with 9ml of fat-free plain yoghurt containing streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus (10(8) and 10(7)cfu/g, respectively) in gently vortexed tubes. survival rates were calculated every 15min by dividing the number of viable cells, obtained using conventional laboratory procedures, by the baseline number. results: survival rates were 8% (s. mutans 6519t), 12% (s. mutans 31738), 35% (s. oralis 25671) and >50% (all other species tested) after 15min, and 0.01% (s. mutans) and >10% (all other species tested) after 30min. overall, s. parasanguinis and s. sobrinus were the most resistant species. when heat-treated yoghurt (<10cfu/g bacteria and inactivated bacteriocins) was used, this antibacterial activity was not found. conclusion: in vitro, yoghurt with live bacteria showed selective anti-mutans activity, suggesting that the overall decrease in mutans streptococci in vivo could be due to a bactericidal effect on s. mutans but not on s. sobrinus.

TI  == identification of critical residues in gap3 of streptococcus parasanguinis involved in fap1 glycosylation, fimbrial formation and in vitro adhesion.
AB  == background: streptococcus parasanguinis is a primary colonizer of human tooth surfaces and plays an important role in dental plaque formation. bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation are mediated by long peritrichous fimbriae that are composed of a 200 kda serine rich glycoprotein named fap1 (fimbriae-associated protein). glycosylation and biogenesis of fap1 are modulated by a gene cluster downstream of the fap1 locus. a gene encoding a glycosylation-associated protein, gap3, was found to be important for fap1 glycosylation, long fimbrial formation and fap1-mediated biofilm formation. results: deletion and site-directed mutagenesis were employed to dissect the regions within gap3 that were important for its function in fap1 glycosylation and biogenesis. a deletion of 6 consecutive amino acids, pdlpil, eliminated the production of the mature 200 kda fap1 protein and gave rise instead to a 470 kda  fap1 intermediate that was only partially glycosylated. site-directed mutagenesis of the 6 amino acids revealed that only three of these amino acids were required. mutants in these amino acids (l64r, p65r and l67t) produced the premature 470 kda fap1 intermediate. mutants in the remaining amino acids produced the mature form  of fap1. cell surface expression of the fap1 precursor among l64r, p65r and l67t  mutants was reduced to levels consistent with that of a gap3 insertional mutant.  electron micrographs showed that these 3 mutants lost their long peritrichous fimbriae. furthermore, their in vitro adhesion ability to saliva-coated hydroxylapatite (sha) was inhibited. conclusion: our data suggest that 3 highly conserved, hydrophobic residues l64, p65 and l67 in gap3 are essential for gap3 function and are important for complete glycosylation of fap1, fimbrial formation and bacterial adhesion.

TI  == the utility of affinity-tags for detection of a streptococcal protein from a variety of streptococcal species.
AB  == there is no systematic examination of affinity tag utility in gram-positive bacteria, which limits the investigation of protein function in this important group of bacteria as specific antibodies for many of native proteins are generally not available. in this study, we utilized an e. coli-streptococcal shuttle vector pvt1666 and constructed two sets of expression plasmids pvpt-ctag  and pvpt-ntag, with each set containing five affinity tags (gst, gfp, hsv, t7 and nano) that can be fused to either the c- or n-terminus of a target protein. a putative glycosyltransferase (gtf2) essential for fap1 glycosylation was used to  demonstrate the utility of the cassettes in detection of gtf2 fusion proteins, and the biological relevance of the proteins in our working strain streptococcus  parasanguinis. gfp and t7 tags were readily expressed in s. parasanguinis as either an n- or c-terminal fusion to gtf2. only the c- terminal fusion of gst and hsv were able to be identified in s. parasanguinis. the nano tag was not detected in either e. coli or s. parasanguinis. genetic complementation experiments indicated that all the tagged gtf2 fusion proteins could restore the gtf2 function in the null mutant except for the nano-tagged gtf2 at its n-terminal fusion. using a t7-tagged gtf2 fusion construct, we demonstrated that the fusion  cassette is also useful in detection of the fusion tag expression in other streptococci including s. mutans, s. pneumoniae and s. sanguinis. therefore, the  expression cassettes we constructed will be a useful tool not only to investigate protein-protein interactions in fap1 biogenesis in s. parasanguinis, but also to  study protein functions in other gram-positive bacteria in which pvt1666 replicates.

AB  == oral microbes that colonize in the mouths of humans contribute to disease susceptibility, but it is unclear if host genetic factors mediate colonization. we therefore tested the hypothesis that the levels at which oral microbes colonize in the mouth are heritable. dental plaque biofilms were sampled from intact tooth surfaces of 118 caries-free twins. an additional 86 caries-active twins were sampled for plaque from carious lesions and intact tooth surfaces. using a reverse capture checkerboard assay the relative abundance of 82 bacterial species was determined. an integrative computational predictive model determined  microbial abundance patterns of microbial species in caries-free twins as compared to caries-active twins. heritability estimates were calculated for the relative microbial abundance levels of the microbial species in both groups. the  levels of 10 species were significantly different in healthy individuals than in  caries-active individuals, including, a. defectiva, s. parasanguinis, s. mitis/oralis, s. sanguinis, s. cristatus, s. salivarius, streptococcus sp. clone  ch016, g. morbillorum and g. haemolysans. moderate to high heritability estimates were found for these species (h(2) = 56%-80%, p < .0001). similarity of the overall oral microbial flora was also evident in caries-free twins from multivariate distance matrix regression analysis. it appears that genetic and/or  familial factors significantly contribute to the colonization of oral beneficial  species in twins.

TI  == role of gap3 in fap1 glycosylation, stability, in vitro adhesion, and fimbrial and biofilm formation of streptococcus parasanguinis.
AB  == background/aims: streptococcus parasanguinis is a primary colonizer of the tooth  surface. its adhesion is mediated by the long fimbriae, which are composed of multiple subunits of a serine-rich glycoprotein, fap1. previous studies revealed  that a chromosomal region located downstream of fap1 is involved in the secretion and glycosylation of fap1. in this study, we investigated the role of a glycosylation-associated gene, gap3, in fap1 biogenesis. methods: a gap3 non-polar mutant was constructed by insertional inactivation. the phenotype of the mutant and the subcellular distribution of its products were investigated. the binding ability of the mutant was tested with saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sha). electron microscopy was used to observe the morphological changes on the mutant cell surface. confocal microscopy was utilized to determine biofilm formation ability. results: the gap3 mutant produced a partially glycosylated fap1 precursor, that was less stable than mature fap1. the fap1 precursor was distributed in all subcellular fractions including the cell surface and culture medium although in decreased amounts. these data suggest a role for gap3 in fap1  glycosylation as well as a link between glycosylation and secretion of fap1. the  gap3 mutant had reduced binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. electron microscopy revealed that the gap3 mutant had lost its long fimbriae. biofilm formation was also inhibited by the gap3 mutation. fewer gap3 mutant cells adhered to the biofilm surface and microcolony formation was decreased. conclusion: gap3 is required for the complete glycosylation and secretion of fap1, which is important for fimbrial assembly, bacterial adhesion, and in vitro  biofilm formation.

TI  == interaction between two putative glycosyltransferases is required for glycosylation of a serine-rich streptococcal adhesin.
AB  == fap1, a serine-rich glycoprotein, is essential for fimbrial biogenesis and biofilm formation of streptococcus parasanguinis (formerly s. parasanguis). fap1-like proteins are conserved in many streptococci and staphylococci and have  been implicated in bacterial virulence. fap1 contains two serine-rich repeat regions that are modified by o-linked glycosylation. a seven-gene cluster has been identified, and this cluster is implicated in fap1 biogenesis. in this study, we investigated the initial step of fap1 glycosylation by using a recombinant fap1 as a model. this recombinant molecule has the same monosaccharide composition profile as the native fap1 protein. glycosyl linkage analyses indicated that n-acetylglucosamine (glcnac) is among the first group of  sugar residues transferred to the fap1 peptide. two putative glycosyltransferases, gtf1 and gtf2, were essential for the glycosylation of fap1 with glcnac-containing oligosaccharide(s) in both s. parasanguinis as well as in  the fap1 glycosylation system in escherichia coli. yeast two-hybrid analysis as well as in vitro and in vivo glutathione s-transferase pull-down assays demonstrated the two putative glycosyltransferases interacted with each other. the interaction domain was mapped to an n-terminal region of gtf1 that was required for the fap1 glycosylation. the data in this study suggested that the formation of the gtf1 and gtf2 complex was required for the initiation of the fap1 glycosylation and that the n-terminal region of gtf1 was necessary.

TI  == differential roles of individual domains in selection of secretion route of a streptococcus parasanguinis serine-rich adhesin, fap1.
AB  == fimbria-associated protein 1 (fap1) is a high-molecular-mass glycosylated surface adhesin required for fimbria biogenesis and biofilm formation in streptococcus parasanguinis. the secretion of mature fap1 is dependent on the presence of seca2, a protein with some homology to, but with a different role from, seca. the signals that direct the secretion of fap1 to the seca2-dependent secretion pathway rather than the seca-dependent secretion pathway have not yet been identified. in this study, fap1 variants containing different domains were expressed in both seca2 wild-type and mutant backgrounds and were tested for their ability to be secreted by the seca- or seca2-dependent pathway. the presence or absence of the cell wall anchor domain (residues 2531 to 2570) at the c terminus did not alter the selection of the fap1 secretion route. the fap1 signal peptide (residues 1 to 68) was sufficient to support the secretion of a heterologous protein via the seca-dependent pathway, suggesting that the signal peptide was sufficient for recognition by the seca-dependent pathway. the minimal sequences of fap1 required for the seca2-dependent pathway included the n-terminal signal peptide, nonrepetitive region i (residues 69 to 102), and part  of nonrepetitive region ii (residues 169 to 342). the two serine-rich repeat regions (residues 103 to 168 and 505 to 2530) were not required for fap1 secretion. however, they were both involved in the specific inhibition of fap1 secretion via the seca-dependent pathway.

AB  == fap1, a fimbria-associated glycoprotein, is essential for biofilm formation of streptococcus parasanguinis and mediates bacterial attachment to saliva-coated hydroxylapatite, an in vitro tooth model (e. h. froeliger and p. m. fives-taylor, infect. immun. 69:2512-2519, 2001; h. wu and p. m. fives-taylor, mol. microbiol.  34:1070-1081, 1999; h. wu et al., mol. microbiol. 28:487-500, 1998). fap1 belongs to a growing family of high-molecular-weight serine-rich proteins found in streptococcal and staphylococcal species and possesses two serine-rich repeat regions. the glycan moiety of fap1 appears to be o linked within the repeat regions (a. e. stephenson et al., mol. microbiol. 43:147-157, 2002). in the present study, we identified a gene cluster immediately upstream of fap1 that encodes three putative glycosyltransferases and one nucleotide-sugar synthetase-like protein. inactivation of one glycosyltransferase gene galt2 abolished the expression of two glycan epitopes; however, it did not alter bacterial ability to adhere to both sha and saliva-conditioned biofilm surfaces.  in contrast, the biofilms formed by the galt2 mutant were shallow and had a 70% decrease in biomass accumulation, suggesting that these glycan moieties mediated  by galt2 are not required for the initial adhesion but are important for biofilm  formation. a recombinant n-terminal fap1 polypeptide was shown to interact with a 53-kda salivary protein and block and displace bacterial attachment, further demonstrating the role of the fap1 polypeptide in bacterial adhesion. taken together, these results suggest that fap1 glycosylation plays an important role in bacterial biofilm formation, whereas the nonglycosylated fap1 peptide mediates bacterial initial attachment during the process of biofilm formation.

TI  == relationship between the ability of oral streptococci to interact with platelet glycoprotein ibalpha and with the salivary low-molecular-weight mucin, mg2.
AB  == the oral streptococci streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus oralis are common aetiological agents of infective endocarditis, and their ability to adhere to and induce the aggregation of platelets is thought to be a virulence trait. the platelet glycoprotein gpibalpha has been implicated  as the adhesion receptor for s. sanguinis and s. gordonii, but it is not known if this is the case for s. oralis and other species. the aim of this study was to determine the gpibalpha-interactive capability of a range of oral streptococci and to determine the relationship between this capability and their ability to interact with the salivary constituents that they would encounter in their normal habitat. all platelet-adhesive s. sanguinis strains and most s. gordonii strains  adhered in a gpibalpha-dependent manner, but strains of s. oralis, streptococcus  cristatus, streptococcus parasanguinis and streptococcus mitis had no direct affinity for platelets. those strains that were able to bind gpibalpha also bound to the low-molecular-weight submandibular salivary mucin, mg2, and this interaction was sialic acid-dependent. the data suggest that s. sanguinis and s.  gordonii may be efficient colonizers of platelet vegetations because of their adaptation to recognize sialylated salivary mucins. in contrast, s. oralis does not interact with platelets and so is likely to colonize vegetations through an as yet unidentified mechanism.

TI  == microbial risk indicators of early childhood caries.
AB  == the aim of this study was to use molecular identification methods, such as 16s rna gene sequence and reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization, for identification of the bacteria associated with dental caries and with dental health in a subset of 204 twins aged 1.5 to 7 years old. a total of 448 plaque samples (118 collected from caries-free subjects and 330 from caries-active subjects) were used for analysis. we compared the bacteria found in biofilms of children exhibiting severe dental caries, with different degrees of lesion severity, with those found in biofilms of caries-free children. a panel of 82 bacterial species was selected, and a pcr-based reverse-capture checkerboard method was used for detection. a simple univariate test was used to determine the overabundance and underabundance of bacterial species in the diseased and in the  healthy groups. features identified with this univariate test were used to construct a probabilistic disease prediction model. furthermore, a method for the analysis of global patterns of gene expression was performed to permit simultaneous analysis of the abundance of significant species by allowing cross-bacterial comparisons of abundance profiles between caries-active and caries-free subjects. our results suggested that global patterns of microbial abundance in this population are very distinctive. the top bacterial species found to be overabundant in the caries-active group were actinomyces sp. strain b19sc, streptococcus mutans, and lactobacillus spp., which exhibited an inverse relationship to beneficial bacterial species, such as streptococcus parasanguinis, abiotrophia defectiva, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis,  and streptococcus sanguinis.

TI  == the maintenance in the oral cavity of children of tetracycline-resistant bacteria and the genes encoding such resistance.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the maintenance of tetracycline-resistant oral bacteria and the genes encoding tetracycline resistance in these bacteria in children (aged 4--6 years) over a period of 12 months. methods: plaque and saliva samples were taken from 26 children. tetracycline-resistant bacteria were isolated and identified. the types of resistance genes and their genetic locations were also determined. results: fifteen out of 18 children harboured tetracycline-resistant (defined as having a mic>or=8 mg/l) oral bacteria at all three time points. the median percentage of tetracycline-resistant bacteria at 0, 6 and 12 months was 1.37, 1.37 and 0.85%, respectively; these were not significantly different. the mic(50) of the group was 64 mg/l at all three time points compared with the mic(90), which was 64 mg/l at 0 months, and 128 mg/l at  6 and 12 months. the most prevalent resistant species were streptococci (68%), which were isolated at all three time points in 13 children. the most prevalent gene encoding tetracycline resistance was tet(m) and this was found in different  species at all three time points. for the first time, tet(32) was found in streptococcus parasanguinis and eubacterium saburreum. pcr and southern-blot analysis (on isolates from three of the children) showed that the tet(m) gene was located on a tn916-like element and could be detected at all three time points, in four different genera, streptococcus, granulicatella, veillonella and neisseria. conclusions: the results of this study show that tetracycline-resistant bacteria and tet(m) are maintained within the indigenous oral microbiota of children, even though they are unlikely to have been directly  exposed to tetracycline.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic selection of microbiota surviving under dental restorations.
AB  == the effects of sealing infected carious dentine below dental restorations on the  phenotypic and genotypic diversity of the surviving microbiota was investigated.  it was hypothesized that the microbiota would be subject to nutrient limitation or nutrient simplification, as it would no longer have access to dietary components or salivary secretion for growth. the available nutrients would be limited primarily to serum proteins passing from the pulp through the patent dentinal tubules to the infected dentine. ten lesions were treated, and infected  dentine was sealed below dental restorations for approximately 5 months. duplicate standardized samples of infected dentine were taken at baseline and after the removal of the restorations. the baseline microbiota were composed primarily of lactobacillus spp., streptococcus mutans, streptococcus parasanguinis, actinomyces israelii, and actinomyces gerencseriae. none of these  taxa were isolated among the microbiota of the dentine samples taken after 5 months, which consisted of only actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus intermedius, and streptococcus mitis. the microbiota of the final sample exhibited a significantly (p < 0.001) increased ability to produce glycosidic enzymes (sialidase, beta-n-acetylglucosaminidase, and beta-galactosidase), which liberate sugars from glycoproteins. the genotypic diversity of s. oralis and a. naeslundii was significantly (p = 0.002 and p = 0.001, respectively) reduced in the final samples. there was significantly (p < 0.001) greater genotypic diversity within these taxa between the pairs of dentine samples taken at baseline than was found in the 5-month samples, indicating that  the dentine was more homogenous than it was at baseline. we propose that during the interval between placement of the restorations and their removal, the available nutrient, primarily serum proteins, or the relative simplicity and homogeneity of the nutrient supply significantly affected the surviving microbiota. the surviving microbiota was less complex, based on compositional, phenotypic, and genotypic analyses, than that isolated from carious lesions which were also exposed to salivary secretions and ph perturbations.

TI  == identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by an oligonucleotide array.
AB  == viridans streptococci (vs) are common etiologic agents of subacute infective endocarditis and are capable of causing a variety of pyogenic infections. many species of vs are difficult to differentiate by phenotypic traits. an oligonucleotide array based on 16s-23s rrna gene intergenic spacer (its) sequences was developed to identify 11 clinically relevant vs. these 11 species were streptococcus anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, and s. uberis. the method consisted of pcr amplification of the its regions by using  a pair of universal primers, followed by hybridization of the digoxigenin-labeled pcr products to a panel of species-specific oligonucleotides immobilized on a nylon membrane. after 120 strains of the 11 species of vg and 91 strains of other bacteria were tested, the sensitivity and specificity of the oligonucleotide array were found to be 100% (120 of 120 strains) and 95.6% (87 of 91 strains), respectively. s. pneumoniae cross-hybridized to the probes used for the identification of s. mitis, and simple biochemical tests such as optochin susceptibility or bile solubility should be used to differentiate s. pneumoniae from s. mitis. in conclusion, identification of species of vs by use of the present oligonucleotide array is accurate and could be used as an alternative reliable method for species identification of strains of vs.

TI  == oral streptococcal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mediates interaction  with porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae.
AB  == interaction of porphyromonas gingivalis with plaque-forming bacteria is necessary for its colonization in periodontal pockets. participation of streptococcus oralis glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and p. gingivalis fimbriae in this interaction has been reported. in this investigation, the contribution of various oral streptococcal gapdhs to interaction with p. gingivalis fimbriae was examined. streptococcal cell surface gapdh activity was measured by incubation of a constant number of streptococci with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and analysis for the conversion of nad+ to nadh based  on the absorbance at 340 nm. coaggregation activity was measured by a turbidimetric assay. cell surface gapdh activity was correlated with coaggregation activity (r = 0.854, p < 0.01) with spearman's rank correlation coefficient. s. oralis atcc 9811 and atcc 10557, streptococcus gordonii g9b, streptococcus sanguinis atcc 10556, and streptococcus parasanguinis atcc 15909 exhibited high cell surface gapdh activity and coaggregation activity; consequently, their cell surface gapdhs were extracted with mutanolysin and purified on a cibacron blue sepharose column. subsequently, their dna sequences were elucidated. purified gapdhs bound p. gingivalis recombinant fimbrillin by western blot assay, furthermore, their dna sequences displayed a high degree of homology with one another. moreover, s. oralis recombinant gapdh inhibited coaggregation between p. gingivalis and the aforementioned five streptococcal strains in a dose-dependent manner. these results suggest that gapdhs of various  plaque-forming streptococci may be involved in their attachment to p. gingivalis  fimbriae and that they may contribute to p. gingivalis colonization.

TI  == identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci by sequence analysis of the 16s-23s ribosomal dna spacer region.
AB  == the feasibility of sequence analysis of the 16s-23s ribosomal dna (rdna) intergenic spacer (its) for the identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci (vs) was evaluated. the its regions of 29 reference strains (11 species) of vs were amplified by pcr and sequenced. these 11 species were streptococcus anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, s. intermedius, s. mitis,  s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, and s. uberis. the its lengths (246 to 391 bp) and sequences were highly conserved among strains within a species. the intraspecies similarity scores for the its sequences ranged from 0.98 to 1.0, except for the score for s. gordonii strains.  the interspecies similarity scores for the its sequences varied from 0.31 to 0.93. phylogenetic analysis of the its regions revealed that evolution of the regions of some species of vs is not parallel to that of the 16s rrna genes. one  hundred six clinical isolates of vs were identified by the rapid id 32 strep system (biomerieux vitek, marcy l'etoile, france) and by its sequencing, and the  level of disagreement between the two methods was 18% (19 isolates). most isolates producing discrepant results could be unambiguously assigned to a specific species by their its sequences. the accuracy of using its sequencing for identification of vs was verified by 16s rdna sequencing for all strains except strains of s. oralis and s. mitis, which were difficult to differentiate by their 16s rdna sequences. in conclusion, identification of species of vs by its sequencing is reliable and could be used as an alternative accurate method for identification of vs.

TI  == identification of streptococcus sanguinis with a pcr-generated species-specific dna probe.
AB  == the objective of the present study was to design a pcr-generated dna probe and determine the specificity of the probe for the identification of clinical isolates of streptococcus sanguinis. to do this, we examined over 200 arbitrarily primed pcr (ap-pcr) amplicon patterns obtained with dna from clinical isolates of s. sanguinis. a 1.6-kb dna amplicon that was common to all ap-pcr profiles was extracted from agarose gels and then cloned and sequenced. a search for a similar sequence in the genbank database with the blastn program revealed that the 1.6-kb dna fragment comprised an intergenic region between two housekeeping genes, uncc  (proton-translocating atpase) and mura (udp-n-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase). three digoxigenin-labeled dna probes were synthesized on the basis  of the sequence of the 1.6-kb fragment: the sequence of probe ssa-1 contained the proton-translocating atpase (uncc) and the entire intergenic region, the sequence of probe ssa-2 contained only the intergenic region, and the sequence of probe ssa-3 contained an internal region of the mura gene. dot blot hybridization showed that the three probes displayed signals for hybridization to both s. sanguinis strain atcc 10556 and the s. sanguinis clinical isolates. probe ssa-1,  however, hybridized to dna from s. oralis and s. mitis. probe ssa-3 hybridized to dna from s. gordonii, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, and s. vestibularis. the probe ssa-2-specific intergenic region appeared to be specific for s. sanguinis. the results from this study suggest that probe ssa-2 may serve as a species-specific dna probe for the identification of clinical isolates of s. sanguinis.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacterial species associated with childhood caries.
AB  == although substantial epidemiologic evidence links streptococcus mutans to caries, the pathobiology of caries may involve more complex communities of bacterial species. molecular methods for bacterial identification and enumeration now make  it possible to more precisely study the microbiota associated with dental caries. the purpose of this study was to compare the bacteria found in early childhood caries (ecc) to those found in caries-free children by using molecular identification methods. cloning and sequencing of bacterial 16s ribosomal dnas from a healthy subject and a subject with ecc were used for identification of novel species or uncultivated phylotypes and species not previously associated with dental caries. ten novel phylotypes were identified. a number of species or  phylotypes that may play a role in health or disease were identified and warrant  further investigation. in addition, quantitative measurements for 23 previously known bacterial species or species groups were obtained by a reverse capture checkerboard assay for 30 subjects with caries and 30 healthy controls. significant differences were observed for nine species: s. sanguinis was associated with health and, in order of decreasing cell numbers, actinomyces gerencseriae, bifidobacterium, s. mutans, veillonella, s. salivarius, s. constellatus, s. parasanguinis, and lactobacillus fermentum were associated with  caries. these data suggest that a. gerencseriae and other actinomyces species may play an important role in caries initiation and that a novel bifidobacterium may  be a major pathogen in deep caries. further investigation could lead to the identification of targets for biological interventions in the caries process and  thereby contribute to improved prevention of and treatment for this significant public health problem.

AB  == the discriminatory power, speed, and interlaboratory reproducibility of trna intergenic length polymorphism analysis (tdna-pcr) combined with capillary electrophoresis was evaluated for the identification of streptococci. this method was carried out in three different laboratories under highly standardized conditions for 54 strains belonging to 18 different species. it was concluded that interlaboratory reproducibility of tdna fingerprints produced by means of capillary electrophoresis was sufficiently high to permit the exchange between different laboratories and the construction of common libraries which can be consulted for comparison with fingerprints obtained independently in separate laboratories. in a second step, 17 other species were included in the study and examined in one of the participating laboratories. all streptococcus species studied, except s. mitis, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. pneumoniae, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis, showed distinguishable tdna fingerprints. a database of well-characterized strains was constructed to enable computer-aided identification of unknown streptococcal isolates.

TI  == mannosidase production by viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the production of mannosidase activity by all currently recognized species of human viridans group streptococci was determined using an assay in which bacterial growth was dependent on the degradation of the high-mannose-type glycans of rnase b and subsequent utilization of released mannose. rnase b is an  excellent substrate for the demonstration of mannosidase activity since it is a glycoprotein with a single glycosylation site which is occupied by high-mannose-type glycoforms containing five to nine mannose residues. mannosidase activity was produced only by some members of the mitis group (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus parasanguinis, and streptococcus pneumoniae) and streptococcus intermedius of the anginosus group. none of the other species within the salivarius and mutans groups or streptococcus peroris and streptococcus sanguinis produced mannosidase activity. using matrix-assisted  laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, it was demonstrated that the man(5) glycan alone was degraded while man(6) to man(9), which contain terminal alpha(1-->2) mannose residues in addition to the alpha(1-->3), alpha(1-->6), and beta(1-->4) residues present in man(5), remained intact. investigations on mannosidase production using synthetic (4-methylumbelliferone-  or p-nitrophenol-linked) alpha- or beta-mannosides as substrates indicated that there was no correlation between degradation of these substrates and degradation  of the man(5) glycan of rnase b. no species degraded these alpha-linked mannosides, while degradation of the beta-linked synthetic substrates was restricted to strains within the streptococcus anginosus, s. gordonii, and s. intermedius species. the data generated using a native glycoprotein as the substrate demonstrate that mannosidase production within the viridans group streptococci is more widely distributed than had previously been considered.

TI  == prevalence of the amylase-binding protein a gene (abpa) in oral streptococci.
AB  == salivary amylase binds specifically to a number of oral streptococcal species. this interaction may play an important role in dental plaque formation. recently, a 585-bp gene was cloned and sequenced from streptococcus gordonii challis encoding a 20.5-kda amylase-binding protein (abpa). the goal of this study was to determine if related genes are present in other species of oral streptococci. biotinylated abpa was used in southern blot analysis to screen genomic dna from several strains representing eight species of oral streptococci. this probe hybridized with a 4.0-kb hindiii restriction fragment from all 13 strains of s. gordonii tested. the probe did not appear to bind to any restriction fragments from other species of amylase-binding oral streptococci including streptococcus mitis (with the exception of 1 of 14 strains), streptococcus crista (3 strains),  streptococcus anginosus (1 strain), and streptococcus parasanguinis (1 strain), or to non-amylase-binding oral streptococci including streptococcus sanguinis (3  strains), streptococcus oralis (4 strains), and streptococcus mutans (1 strain).  primers homologous to sequences within the 3' and 5' ends of abpa yielded products of 400 bp following pcr of genomic dna from the southern blot-positive strains. several of these pcr products were cloned and sequenced. the levels of similarity of these cloned products to the abpa of s. gordonii challis ranged from 91 to 96%. these studies reveal that the abpa gene appears to be specific to s. gordonii and differs from genes encoding amylase-binding proteins from other species of amylase-binding streptococci.

AB  == the utility of pcr analysis of transfer dna intergenic spacer length polymorphism (tdna-ilp) for the identification to the species level of clinically relevant viridans streptococci was evaluated with a collection of reference strains of 15  species of the salivarius, anginosus, mitis and mutans rrna homology groups. pcr  products generated by using fluorescent, outwardly directed, consensus tdna primers were analysed by electrophoresis on denaturating polyacrylamide gels and  by laser fluorescence scanning. eleven species showed specific and distinct tdna  patterns: streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis,  streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus criceti and streptococcus ratti. indistinguishable patterns were obtained among two groups of species: streptococcus vestibularis and streptococcus salivarius on the one hand and streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus intermedius on the other. s. mitis strains produced heterogeneous patterns that could be separated into three groups: a group containing s. mitis biovar 1 and two s. mitis biovar 2 groups, one of which clustered with s. parasanguinis strains while the other showed patterns unrelated to other species. these results agree in part with protein electrophoretic analysis showing that s. mitis biovar 2 strains belong to several streptococcal taxa. in conclusion, pcr analysis of tdna-ilp holds promise for rapid identification of viridans streptococci that are difficult to identify by phenotypic tests.
