vaginal lactobacillus gasseri cmul57 can inhibit herpes simplex type 2 but not coxsackievirus b4e2.
this study aimed at demonstrating the antiviral activity of lactobacillus gasseri cmul57 (l. gasseri cmul57), l. acidophilus cmul67 and l. plantarum cmul140 against herpes simplex type 2 (hsv-2) and coxsackievirus b4e2 (cvb4e2), which are enveloped and naked viruses, respectively. these lactobacilli were non-cytotoxic and were able to reduce the cytopathic effect induced by hsv-2 in vero cell monolayers. however, lactobacilli were not active against cvb4e2. tested lactobacilli displayed anti-hsv-2 activity when they were co-incubated with the virus prior to inoculating the mixture to vero cell monolayers. the detection of hsv-2 dna by pcr in pellets of bacteria/virus mixtures let us to hypothesize that anti-hsv-2 activity of lactobacilli resulted from the viruses' entrapment. this study showed the capabilities of vaginal lactobacilli to inhibit enveloped viruses such as hsv-2.
the adherence of trichomonas vaginalis to host ectocervical cells is influenced by lactobacilli.
objectives: trichomoniasis is a common sexually transmitted disease, and adhesion of the pathogen trichomonas vaginalis to the host vaginal cells is the first step in establishing infection. for this to happen, the pathogen has to overcome a natural protective barrier composed mostly of lactobacilli. the objective of this study was to understand the role of lactobacilli in the adhesion of t vaginalis to host cells. methods: adhesion assays were carried out by incubating vaginal epithelial cells (vecs) with t vaginalis and lactobacilli together and compared with non-lactobacilli recipient controls. by varying incubation parameters and testing several microbial isolates, the number of pathogens that adhered to the vecs was determined by flow cytometry. results: overall, but with few exceptions, lactobacilli caused inhibition of t vaginalis adhesion to a variable degree. lactobacillus gasseri atcc 9857 and cbi3 (ambiguous lactobacillus plantarum or lactobacillus pentosus) caused the highest level of parasite adhesion inhibition and enhancement, respectively. these isolates of lactobacillus can profoundly alter the adhesive properties of low-adherent and high-adherent strains of t vaginalis in a dose-dependent manner. additionally, the effects of lactobacilli on t vaginalis adhesion are strictly contact-dependent, and surface lipoglycans of t vaginalis are most likely not involved in this modulation of adhesion mediated by the bacteria. conclusions: lactobacilli can modulate adhesion of t vaginalis by significantly modifying the natural adhesive properties of various t vaginalis strains. this study highlights the importance of considering the role of the vaginal microbiota in the pathogenesis of trichomoniasis.
differences in tlr9-dependent inhibitory effects of h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and nf-kappa b/i kappa b-alpha system activation by genomic dna from five lactobacillus species.
lactic acid bacteria (lab) show anti-inflammatory effects, and their genomic dna  was identified as one of the anti-inflammatory components. despite the differences in anti-inflammatory effects between live lab dependent not only on genus but also species, this effect has not been compared at the genomic dna level. we compared the anti-inflammatory effects of the genomic dna from five lactobacillus species-lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus reuteri-using caco-2 cells. to evaluate anti-inflammatory effects, decreases in h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibition of h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation were examined. all lab genomic dnas dose-dependently decreased h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibited h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation. comparison of these effects between lactobacillus species showed that the anti-inflammatory effects of l. acidophilus genomic dna are lower than those of the other species. furthermore, suppression of toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9), a specific receptor of bacterial dna, expression by rnai abolished the decrease of h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibition of h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation by lab genomic dna. our results demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory effects of genomic dna differ between lactobacillus species and tlr9 is one of the major pathways responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of lab genomic dna.
in vitro screening of lactobacilli with antagonistic activity against helicobacter pylori from traditionally fermented foods.
helicobacter pylori may cause stomach diseases such as chronic gastritis, peptic  ulcer, and gastric cancer, and several studies reported that lactobacilli have inhibitory effects on h. pylori. in this study, 38 lactobacillus strains were screened for anti-h. pylori activity using in vitro methods, including survivability under the simulated gastric conditions, agar plate diffusion, urease activity, coaggregation, autoaggregation, and hydrocarbon analysis. the results indicate that 2 lactobacillus strains showed potential anti-h. pylori activity in vitro. lactobacillus plantarum 18 had the largest zone of inhibition and markedly reduced the urease activity of h. pylori. lactobacillus gasseri chen had higher coaggregation rate (58.15%) and hydrophobicity (59.27%) compared with the other strains. further research is needed to verify the activities of these strains against h. pylori.
antibacterial activity of lactobacillus species against vibrio species.
forty-one lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of vibrio. l. plantarum and l. casei were the most effective, and l. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of vibrio species. l. gasseri and l. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while l. reuteri and l. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against vibrio species. l. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against vibrio species. however, none of the lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella enteritidis, s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. inhibition of the vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the lactobacillus species.
