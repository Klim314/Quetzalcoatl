TI  == antimicrobial activity of iodoquinol 1%-hydrocortisone acetate 2% gel against ciclopirox and clotrimazole.
AB  == commercially available topical formulations consisting of iodoquinol 1%-hydrocortisone acetate 2%, ciclopirox 0.77%, and clotrimazole 1%-betamethasone dipropionate 0.5% were assessed for their antimicrobial activity against cultures of micrococcus luteus, propionibacterium acnes, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), pseudomonas aeruginosa, corynebacterium aquaticum,  trichophyton mentagrophytes, malassezia furfur, microsporum canis, candida albicans, trichophyton rubrum, or epidermophyton floccosum. at 1 and 5 minutes following inoculation into suspensions of each product, aliquots were removed, serially diluted, and plated onto appropriate agar to determine the log reduction in colony-forming units (cfus) for each organism. iodoquinol 1% produced the broadest and greatest antimicrobial activity as measured by a 3-log reduction of  cfu, active against all microbes tested following incubation times of 1 or 5 minutes, except m luteus. by contrast, ciclopirox 0.77% and clotrimazole 1% showed activity against p aeruginosa and t rubrum, with ciclopirox also killing m luteus, p acnes, m canis, c albicans, and e floccosum at 5 minutes. iodoquinol 1%-hydrocortisone acetate 2% also was the only product that showed effective antibacterial reduction of mrsa at 1 minute.

TI  == air-borne microbial contamination of surfaces in a uk dental clinic.
AB  == little is known about the number, type, or antibiotic resistance profiles, of air-borne microbes present in hospital settings yet such information is important in designing effective measures to reduce cross-infection. in this study settle plates were used to identify and quantify the air-borne microbes present in a dental clinic. all isolates were identified to species level using partial 16s ribosomal rna gene sequencing and their susceptibility to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, gentamicin, penicillin, tetracycline or vancomycin was performed. the mean numbers of viable bacteria detected for each sampling occasion during periods of clinical activity and in the absence of such activity  were 21.9 x 10(2 )cfu/m2/h and 2.3 x 10(2 )cfu/m2/h respectively. one hundred ninety-three distinct colony morphotypes, comprising 73 species, were isolated during the study and 48% of these were resistant to at least one antibiotic. the  mean numbers of different morphotypes detected per sampling occasion were 14.3 and 5 during periods of clinical activity and inactivity respectively. propionibacterium acnes, micrococcus luteus and staphylococcus epidermidis were frequently isolated regardless of whether any clinical activities were taking place. these findings highlight the importance of preventing surfaces from becoming reservoirs of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and thereby contributing to  cross-infection in the dental clinic.

TI  == the antibacterial activity of topical retinoids: the case of retinaldehyde.
AB  == background: retinoids such as retinoic acid (ra), retinol (rol) and retinaldehyde (ral) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. aim: to analyse the potential anti-infective  activities of topical rol, ral and ra. methods: microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of rol, ral and ra were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus flavus, propionibacterium acnes, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus hominis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant s. aureus, methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, streptococcus group b, enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and pseudomonas/klebsiella. in two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% ral or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% ral or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. results: of the three retinoids tested, only ral showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like s. aeureus, micrococcus spp. or  p. acnes. no activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. these results on  reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. mic(50) and mic(90) values for ral were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant s. aureus. the two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with ral had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. in the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2)  for p. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. no resistant bacteria were  found after 2 weeks of topical use. preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of ral is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. conclusion: we have shown that ral differs from parent natural retinoids such as rol and ra in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. this activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the  potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.

TI  == plasmid-borne macrolide resistance in micrococcus luteus.
AB  == a plasmid designated pmec2 which confers resistance to erythromycin, other macrolides, and lincomycin was detected in micrococcus luteus strain maw843 isolated from human skin. curing of this approximately 4.2 kb plasmid from the host organism resulted in erythromycin sensitivity of the strain. introduction of pmec2 into a different m. luteus strain conferred erythromycin resistance upon this strain. macrolide resistance in m. luteus maw843 was an inducible trait. induction occurred at subinhibitory erythromycin concentrations of about 0.02-0.05 micro g ml(-1). erythromycin and oleandomycin were inducers, while spiramycin and tylosin exerted no significant inducer properties. with heterologous expression experiments in corynebacterium glutamicum, using hybrid plasmid constructs and deletion derivatives thereof, it was possible to narrow down the location of the plasmid-borne erythromycin-resistance determinant to a region of about 1.8 kb of pmec2. sequence analysis of the genetic determinant, designated erm(36), identified an orf putatively encoding a 281-residue protein with similarity to 23s rrna adenine n(6)-methyltransferases. erm(36) was most related (about 52-54% identity) to erythromycin-resistance proteins found in high-g+c gram-positive bacteria, including the (opportunistic) pathogenic corynebacteria corynebacterium jeikeium, c. striatum, c. diphtheriae and propionibacterium acnes. this is believed to be the first report of a plasmid-borne, inducible antibiotic resistance in micrococci. the possible role of non-pathogenic, saprophytic micrococci bearing antibiotic-resistance genes in  the spreading of these determinants is discussed.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of sphingosines.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of stratum corneum lipids was examined by screening in vitro various representative phospholipids and sphingolipids. of mixed galacto-cerebrosides; phosphatidic acid; phosphatidic acid-monomethylester-dioleoyl; phosphatidylethanolamine; phosphatidylethanolamine-beta-oleoyl-gamma-palmitoyl; phosphatidylcholine; d-sphingosine; d,l-sphinganine; 4-d-hydroxysphinganine; oleoyl-sphingosine; n,n-dimethylsphingosine; and stearylamine, only the sphingosines and, to a lesser extent, stearylamine were clearly and profoundly effective against staphylococcus aureus (4-log reduction at 6.25 micrograms/ml [20 microm]; 2-log reduction at 0.78 mu/ml [2.5 microm]). the sphingosines were similarly active against streptococcus pyogenes, micrococcus luteus, propionibacterium acnes, brevibacterium epidermidis, and candida albicans, moderately active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ineffective against escherichia coli and serratia marcescens. both erythro- and threo-isomers were effective. optimal inhibition was at 60 min incubation at 37 degrees c and at ph 6.5. antimicrobial activity, which was ca++ dependent, was confirmed in vivo by topical application and microbial challenge. because free sphingosines are available in the stratum corneum and other epidermal layers, these lipids may contribute to the cutaneous  antimicrobial barrier.

TI  == periodic acid-schiff-positive organisms in primary cutaneous bacillus cereus infection. case report and an investigation of the periodic acid-schiff staining  properties of bacteria.
AB  == primary cutaneous bacillus cereus infection frequently presents as a single necrotic bulla on the extremity of an immunocompromised patient. in lesional biopsy specimens and smears, the large gram-positive rods of b cereus may be mistaken for clostridium species. this is a potentially serious error, as bacillus species are resistant to penicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics. we studied a case in which large periodic acid-schiff-staining organisms were seen in the biopsy specimen from a necrotic bulla on the finger of a neutropenic  patient with diffuse large cell lymphoma. the tissue biopsy specimen subsequently yielded a pure culture of b cereus. staining with periodic acid-schiff was then performed on a series of bacterial species in human tissue and from smears of culture colonies. the following bacterial species were found to be consistently periodic acid-schiff positive after diastase digestion: b cereus, corynebacterium diphtheriae, propionibacterium acnes, klebsiella pneumoniae, and micrococcus luteus.
