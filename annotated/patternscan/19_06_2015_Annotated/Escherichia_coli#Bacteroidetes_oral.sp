TI  == miropin, a novel bacterial serpin from the periodontopathogen tannerella forsythia, inhibits a broad range of proteases by using different peptide bonds within the reactive center loop.
AB  == all prokaryotic genes encoding putative serpins identified to date are found in environmental and commensal microorganisms, and only very few prokaryotic serpins have been investigated from a mechanistic standpoint. herein, we characterized a  novel serpin (miropin) from the human pathogen tannerella forsythia, a bacterium  implicated in initiation and progression of human periodontitis. in contrast to other serpins, miropin efficiently inhibited a broad range of proteases (neutrophil and pancreatic elastases, cathepsin g, subtilisin, and trypsin) with  a stoichiometry of inhibition of around 3 and second-order association rate constants that ranged from 2.7 x 10(4) (cathepsin g) to 7.1 x 10(5) m(-1)s(-1) (subtilisin). inhibition was associated with the formation of complexes that were stable during sds-page. the unusually broad specificity of miropin for target proteases is achieved through different active sites within the reactive center loop upstream of the p1-p1' site, which was predicted from an alignment of the primary structure of miropin with those of well studied human and prokaryotic serpins. thus, miropin is unique among inhibitory serpins, and it has apparently  evolved the ability to inhibit a multitude of proteases at the expense of a high  stoichiometry of inhibition and a low association rate constant. these characteristics suggest that miropin arose as an adaptation to the highly proteolytic environment of subgingival plaque, which is exposed continually to an array of host proteases in the inflammatory exudate. in such an environment, miropin may function as an important virulence factor by protecting bacterium from the destructive activity of neutrophil serine proteases. alternatively, it may act as a housekeeping protein that regulates the activity of endogenous t. forsythia serine proteases.

TI  == antibacterial effect of crude extract and metabolites of phytolacca americana on  pathogens responsible for periodontal inflammatory diseases and dental caries.
AB  == background: the oral cavity is the store house of different species of microorganisms that are continuously engaged in causing diseases in the mouth. the present study was conducted to evaluate the antibacterial potential of crude  extracts of the aerial parts of phytolacca americana and its natural compounds against two oral pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus mutans, which are primarily responsible for periodontal inflammatory diseases and dental  caries, as well as a nonpathogenic escherichia coli. methods: crude extract and fractions from the aerial parts of p. americana (0.008-1.8 mg/ml) were evaluated  for their potential antibacterial activity against two oral disease causing microorganisms by micro-assays. the standard natural compounds present in p. americana, kaempferol, quercetin, quercetin 3-glucoside, isoqueritrin and ferulic acid, were also tested for their antibacterial activity against the pathogens at  1-8 mug/ml. results: the crude extract was highly active against p. gingivalis (100% growth inhibition) and moderately active against s. mutans (44% growth inhibition) at 1.8 mg/ml. the chloroform and hexane fraction controlled the growth of p. gingivalis with 91% and 92% growth inhibition at a concentration of  0.2 mg/ml, respectively. kaempferol exerted antibacterial activity against both the pathogens, whereas quercetin showed potent growth inhibition activity against only s. mutans in a concentration dependent manner. conclusion: the crude extract, chloroform fraction, and hexane fraction of p. americana possesses active natural compounds that can inhibit the growth of oral disease causing bacteria. thus, these extracts have the potential for use in the preparation of toothpaste and other drugs related to various oral diseases.

TI  == development of a novel plasmid vector ptio-1 adapted for electrotransformation of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == we report here the construction of a plasmid vector designed for the efficient electrotransformation of the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis. the novel escherichia coli-bacteroides/p. gingivalis shuttle vector, designated ptio-1, is based on the 11.0-kb e. coli-bacteroides conjugative shuttle vector, pval-1 (a pb8-51 derivative). to construct ptio-1, the pb8-51 origin of replication and erythromycin resistance determinant of pval-1 were cloned into the e. coli cloning vector pbluescript ii sk(-) and non-functional regions were deleted. ptio-1 has an almost complete multiple cloning site from pbluescript ii  sk(-). the size of ptio-1 is 4.5kb, which is convenient for routine gene manipulation. ptio-1 was introduced into p. gingivalis via electroporation, and erythromycin-resistant transformants carrying ptio-1 were obtained. we characterized the transformation efficiency, copy number, host range, stability,  and insert size capacity of ptio-1. an efficient plasmid electrotransformation of p. gingivalis will facilitate functional analysis and expression of p. gingivalis genes, including the virulence factors of this bacterium.

TI  == korean ginseng modulates the ileal microbiota and mucin gene expression in the growing rat.
AB  == the study was conducted to investigate whether oral administration of korean ginseng powders can modulate gut microbiota as well as intestinal mucin production at the translational and transcriptional levels in the ileum of the growing rat. thirty individually caged sprague-dawley male rats were allocated to three groups (n = 10) and fed for 21 days either a basal control diet or one of the two treatment diets each containing white or red korean ginseng (wg or rg) powder. bacterial dna was extracted from ileal digesta and subjected to quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) using primers for total bacteria, lactobacillus, bifidobacteria, escherichia coli, bacteroides, and clostridium strains. the qpcr results showed that consumption of wg or rg powder significantly increased the number of total bacteria and lactobacillus strains compared to the control group. consumption of wg powder increased mrna expression of the muc2 gene in the small intestine compared to the control group. there was  no effect of wg or rg on the small intestinal digesta mucin content. correlation  analysis showed that expression of the muc2 gene was significantly associated with the number of total bacteria (r = 0.52, p < 0.05) and lactobacillus strains  (r = 0.53, p < 0.05), respectively. furthermore, the number of lactobacillus strains was significantly correlated with the number of total bacteria (r = 0.87, p < 0.05). consumption of the wg powder modulated the intestinal ecosystem of the growing rat and intestinal mucin gene expression.

TI  == a biochemical analysis of the interaction of porphyromonas gingivalis hu pg0121 protein with dna.
AB  == k-antigen capsule, a key virulence determinant of the oral pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis, is synthesized by proteins encoded in a series of genes transcribed as a large polycistronic message. previously, we identified a 77-base pair inverted repeat region with the potential to form a large stem-loop structure at  the 5' end of this locus. pg0121, one of two genes flanking the capsule operon, was found to be co-transcribed with the operon and to share high similarity to the dna binding protein hu from escherichia coli. a null mutation in pg0121 results in down-regulation of transcription of the capsule synthesis genes and production of capsule. furthermore, we have also shown that pg0121 gene can complement multiple deficiencies in a strain of e. coli that is deficient for both the alpha and beta subunits of hu. here, we examined the biochemical properties of the interaction of pg0121 to dna with the emphasis on the kinds of  nucleic acid architectures that may be encountered at the 77-bp inverted repeat.  we have concluded that although some dna binding characteristics are shared with  e. coli hu, hu pg0121 also shows some distinct characteristics that set it apart  from other hu-like proteins tested to date. we discuss our results in the context of how pg0121 may affect the regulation of the k-antigen capsule expression.

TI  == palatal mucosa derived fibroblasts present an adaptive behavior regarding cytokine secretion when grafted onto the gingival margin.
AB  == background: considering that grafted gingival tissue might have to be adapted to  the receptor area and that fibroblasts have the ability to respond to bacterial stimuli through the release of various cytokines, this study investigated whether fibroblasts from the palatal mucosa behave differently when grafted onto the gingival margin regarding cytokine secretion. methods: biopsies from the palatal  mucosa were collected at the time of free gingival graft surgery, and after four  months re-collection was performed upon surgery for root coverage. fibroblasts were isolated by the explant technique, cultured and stimulated with porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) and escherichia coli (ec) lps for 24 or 48 h for comparative evaluation of the secretion of cytokines and chemokines, such as il-6, il-8/cxcl8, mip-1alpha/ccl3, tgf-beta, vegf and cxcl16. unstimulated cells  were used as the control group. cells were tested for viability through mtt assay, and secretion of cytokines and chemokines was evaluated in the cell supernatants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). results: fibroblasts from the palatal mucosa maintained the same secretion pattern of il-6 when grafted onto the gingival margin. on the contrary, fibroblasts from the marginal  gingival graft showed increased secretion of il-8/cxcl8 even in the absence of stimulation. interestingly, mip-1alpha/ccl3 secretion by fibroblasts from the marginal gingival graft was significantly increased after 48 hours of stimulation with pg lps and after 24 h with ec lps. only fibroblasts from the marginal gingival graft showed secretion of tgf-beta. vegf and cxcl16 secretion were not detected by both subsets of fibroblasts. conclusion: fibroblasts from the palatal mucosa seem to be adapted to local conditions of the site microenvironment when grafted onto the gingival marginal area. this evidence supports the effective participation of fibroblasts in the homeostasis of the marginal periodontium through secretion modulation of important inflammatory mediators.

TI  == xylitol, an anticaries agent, exhibits potent inhibition of inflammatory responses in human thp-1-derived macrophages infected with porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == background: xylitol is a well-known anticaries agent and has been used for the prevention and treatment of dental caries. in this study, the anti-inflammatory effects of xylitol are evaluated for possible use in the prevention and treatment of periodontal infections. methods: cytokine expression was stimulated in thp-1 (human monocyte cell line)-derived macrophages by live porphyromonas gingivalis,  and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a commercial multiplex assay kit were used to determine the effects of xylitol on live p. gingivalis-induced production of cytokine. the effects of xylitol on phagocytosis and the production of nitric  oxide were determined using phagocytosis assay, viable cell count, and griess reagent. the effects of xylitol on p. gingivalis adhesion were determined by immunostaining, and costimulatory molecule expression was examined by flow cytometry. results: live p. gingivalis infection increased the production of representative proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin (il)-1beta, in a multiplicity of infection- and time-dependent manner. live p. gingivalis also enhanced the release of cytokines and chemokines, such as il-12 p40, eotaxin, interferon gamma-induced protein 10, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1. the pretreatment of xylitol significantly inhibited the p. gingivalis-induced cytokines production and nitric oxide production. in addition, xylitol inhibited the attachment of live p. gingivalis on thp-1-derived macrophages. furthermore, xylitol exerted antiphagocytic activity against both escherichia coli and p. gingivalis. conclusion: these findings suggest that xylitol acts as an anti-inflammatory agent in thp-1-derived macrophages infected with live p. gingivalis, which supports its use in periodontitis.

TI  == t cell epitope mimicry between sjogren's syndrome antigen a (ssa)/ro60 and oral,  gut, skin and vaginal bacteria.
AB  == this study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that sjogren's syndrome antigen  a (ssa)/ro60-reactive t cells are activated by peptides originating from oral and gut bacteria. t cell hybridomas generated from hla-dr3 transgenic mice recognized 3 regions on ro60, with core epitopes mapped to amino acids 228-238, 246-256 and  371-381. blast analysis identified several mimicry peptides, originating from human oral, intestinal, skin and vaginal bacteria, as well as environmental bacteria. amongst these, a peptide from the von willebrand factor type a domain protein (vwfa) from the oral microbe capnocytophaga ochracea was the most potent  activator. further, ro60-reactive t cells were activated by recombinant vwfa protein and whole escherichia coli expressing this protein. these results demonstrate that peptides derived from normal human microbiota can activate ro60-reactive t cells. thus, immune responses to commensal microbiota and opportunistic pathogens should be explored as potential triggers for initiating autoimmunity in sle and sjogren's syndrome.

TI  == effects of parental omega-3 fatty acid intake on offspring microbiome and immunity.
AB  == the "western diet" is characterized by increased intake of saturated and omega-6  (n-6) fatty acids with a relative reduction in omega-3 (n-3) consumption. these fatty acids can directly and indirectly modulate the gut microbiome, resulting in altered host immunity. omega-3 fatty acids can also directly modulate immunity through alterations in the phospholipid membranes of immune cells, inhibition of  n-6 induced inflammation, down-regulation of inflammatory transcription factors,  and by serving as pre-cursors to anti-inflammatory lipid mediators such as resolvins and protectins. we have previously shown that consumption by breeder mice of diets high in saturated and n-6 fatty acids have inflammatory and immune-modulating effects on offspring that are at least partially driven by vertical transmission of altered gut microbiota. to determine if parental diets high in n-3 fatty acids could also affect offspring microbiome and immunity, we fed breeding mice an n-3-rich diet with 40% calories from fat and measured immune outcomes in their offspring. we found offspring from mice fed diets high in n-3 had altered gut microbiomes and modestly enhanced anti-inflammatory il-10 from both colonic and splenic tissue. omega-3 pups were protected during peanut oral allergy challenge with small but measurable alterations in peanut-related serologies. however, n-3 pups displayed a tendency toward worsened responses during e. coli sepsis and had significantly worse outcomes during staphylococcus  aureus skin infection. our results indicate excess parental n-3 fatty acid intake alters microbiome and immune response in offspring.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis and e-coli induce different cytokine production patterns in pregnant women.
AB  == objective: pregnant individuals of many species, including humans, are more sensitive to various bacteria or their products as compared with non-pregnant individuals. pregnant individuals also respond differently to different bacteria  or their products. therefore, in the present study, we evaluated whether the increased sensitivity of pregnant women to bacterial products and their heterogeneous response to different bacteria was associated with differences in whole blood cytokine production upon stimulation with bacteria or their products. methods: blood samples were taken from healthy pregnant and age-matched non-pregnant women and ex vivo stimulated with bacteria or lps from porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) or e-coli for 24 hrs. tnfalpha, il-1ss, il-6, il-12 and il-10 were measured using a multiplex luminex system. results: we observed a generally  lower cytokine production after stimulation with pg bacteria or it's lps as compared with e-coli bacteria. however, there was also an effect of pregnancy upon cytokine production: in pregnant women the production of il-6 upon pg stimulation was decreased as compared with non-pregnant women. after stimulation  with e-coli, the production of il-12 and tnfalpha was decreased in pregnant women as compared with non-pregnant women. conclusion: our results showed that cytokine production upon bacterial stimulation of whole blood differed between pregnant and non-pregnant women, showing that the increased sensitivity of pregnant women  may be due to differences in cytokine production. moreover, pregnancy also affected whole blood cytokine production upon pg or e-coli stimulation differently. thus, the different responses of pregnant women to different bacteria or their products may result from variations in cytokine production.

TI  == mucosal vaccination shapes the expression of salivary antibodies and establishment of cd8+ t-cells.
AB  == background: mucosal vaccination for preventing periodontitis shows promising results. however, various administration routes and adjuvants may have a substantial role in the efficacy of the vaccination. the aim of the study is to compare different modes of mucosal vaccination with whole-cell porphyromonas gingivalis and to test the role of various adjuvants as potential modifiers of this process. methods: mucosal vaccine was administered through oral or nasal routes to balb/c mice. the tested adjuvants included escherichia coli cholera toxin, e. coli labile toxin (lt), and unmethylated cpg dinucleotide (cpg). control mice were vaccinated subcutaneously. saliva and serum were collected; anti-p. gingivalis salivary immunoglobulin a (iga) and serum igg were quantified. a quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure anti-p. gingivalis iga levels was established. in addition, cells were extracted from head and neck  lymph nodes, and the relative cd8(+) cells were quantified using flow cytometry.  results: all mucosal vaccination modes induced anti-p. gingivalis salivary iga but not anti-p. gingivalis serum igg. subcutaneous vaccination induced both salivary iga and serum igg against p. gingivalis. mucosal vaccination also induced greater establishment of cd8(+) cells compared to the subcutaneous vaccination. oral mucosal vaccinations with lt or cpg were the most efficient for salivary iga expression and cd8 cell establishment in lymph nodes. conclusions: oral and nasal mucosal vaccination induced a local host response with little systemic effect. the use of cpg or lt as adjuvants with the oral mucosal vaccination was the most efficient vaccination mode in the present mouse model.

TI  == structural and functional characterization of nanu, a novel high-affinity sialic  acid-inducible binding protein of oral and gut-dwelling bacteroidetes species.
AB  == many human-dwelling bacteria acquire sialic acid for growth or surface display. we identified previously a sialic acid utilization operon in tannerella forsythia that includes a novel outer membrane sialic acid-transport system (nanou), where  nano (neuraminate outer membrane permease) is a putative tonb-dependent receptor  and nanu (extracellular neuraminate uptake protein) is a predicted susd family protein. using heterologous complementation of nanou genes into an escherichia coli strain devoid of outer membrane sialic acid permeases, we show that the nanou system from the gut bacterium bacteroides fragilis is functional and demonstrate its dependence on tonb for function. we also show that nanu is required for maximal function of the transport system and that it is expressed in a sialic acid-responsive manner. we also show its cellular localization to the outer membrane using fractionation and immunofluorescence experiments. ligand-binding studies revealed high-affinity binding of sialic acid to nanu (kd  ~400 nm) from two bacteroidetes species as well as binding of a range of sialic acid analogues. determination of the crystal structure of nanu revealed a monomeric susd-like structure containing a novel motif characterized by an extended kinked helix that might determine sugar-binding specificity. the results of the present study characterize the first bacterial extracellular sialic acid-binding protein and define a sialic acid-specific pul (polysaccharide utilization locus).

TI  == different effects of p. gingivalis lps and e. coli lps on the expression of interleukin-6 in human gingival fibroblasts.
AB  == objective: gingival fibroblasts (gfs) produce pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (lps) of porphyromonas gingivalis, which is thought to be mediated by activation of toll-like receptors  (tlr)2 and tlr4. the present study investigated the expression of interleukin (il)-6, tlr2, and tlr4 in gfs of seven different donors upon stimulation with p.  gingivalis lps. the effects of p. gingivalis lps were compared with those of tlr4 agonist escherichia coli lps and tlr2 agonist pam3csk4. materials and methods: gfs were stimulated with p. gingivalis lps, e. coli lps or pam3csk4 and the expression of il-6, tlr2 and tlr4 was measured by qpcr. the surface expression of tlr2 and tlr4 was measured by flow cytometry. results: in gfs from three donors,  p. gingivalis lps and pam3csk4 induced a markedly lower increase in il-6 expression than e. coli lps. this was accompanied by significant down-regulation  of the tlr2 and tlr4 expression. in gfs from another four donors, an increase in  il-6 expression upon stimulation with p. gingivalis lps and pam3csk4 was similar  or even higher than that induced by e. coli lps. in gfs of these donors, all stimuli induced an up-regulation of both mrna and protein expression of tlr2 and  did not influence that of tlr4. conclusions: this study suggests that p. gingivalis lps and e. coli lps differently regulate cytokine production in human  gingival fibroblasts. regulation of the expression level of tlr2 and tlr4 by periodontal pathogens might be an important factor controlling the inflammatory response in gfs.

TI  == induction of immune response and prevention of alveolar bone loss with recombinant porphyromonas gingivalis peptidylarginine deiminase.
AB  == objective: treatments for periodontitis are not absolutely perfect, and a vaccine against porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis) could become a valuable adjunct  therapy for periodontitis. design: in this study, a vaccine of peptidylarginine deiminase (pad) from p. gingivalis was evaluated in p. gingivalis-induced murine  lesion and periodontitis models. the prevention of alveolar bone loss analysis determined by micro-computed x-ray tomography (micro-ct), and histological assays. furthermore, the induction of immune response of mouse anti-pad done with elisa and western blot analysis. results: compared with animal immunization with  incomplete freund's adjuvant (ifa) alone, pad group significantly inhibited (p<0.05) bone resorption. elisa and western blot showed that pad induced response involving immunoglobulin g1 (ig g1) predominantly. conclusions: these results suggest that pad could be a candidate antigen for a vaccine against p. gingivalis infection.

TI  == in vitro bactericidal effects of 625, 525, and 425 nm wavelength (red, green, and blue) light-emitting diode irradiation.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship of 625, 525, and 425 nm wavelengths, providing average power output and effects on three  common pathogenic bacteria. background data: ultraviolet (uv) light kills bacteria, but the bactericidal effects of uv may not be unique, as 425 nm produces a similar effect. the bactericidal effects of light-emitting diode (led) wavelengths such as 625 and 525 nm have not been described. before conducting clinical trials, the appropriate wavelength with reasonable dose and exposure time should be established. materials and methods: the bactericidal effects of 625, 525, and 425 nm wavelength led irradiation were investigated in vitro for the anaerobic bacterium porphyromonas gingivalis and two aerobes (staphylococcus  aureus and escherichia coli dh5alpha). average power output was 6 mw/cm(2) for 1  h. the bacteria were exposed to led irradiation for 1, 2, 4, and 8 h (21.6, 43.2, 86.4, and 172.8 j/cm(2), respectively). led irradiation was performed during growth on agar and in broth. control bacteria were incubated without led irradiation. bacterial growth was expressed in colony-forming units (cfu) and at  an optical density at 600 nm in agar and broth. results: the bactericidal effect  of led phototherapy depended upon wavelength, power density, bacterial viable number, and bacteria species. the bactericidal effect of 425 and 525 nm irradiation varied depending upon the bacterial inoculation, compared with unirradiated samples and samples irradiated with red light. especially, p. gingivalis and e. coli dh5alpha were killed by 425 nm, and s. aureus growth was inhibited by 525 nm. however, the wavelength of 625 nm was not bactericidal for p. gingivalis, e. coli dh5alpha, or s. aureus. conclusions: irradiation at 625 nm light was not bactericidal to s. aureus, e. coli, and p. gingivalis, whereas wavelengths of 425 and 525 nm had bactericidal effects. s. aureus was also killed at 525 nm.

TI  == dna-based adaptive immunity protect host from infection-associated periodontal bone resorption via recognition of porphyromonas gingivalis virulence component.
AB  == background: porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) is one of a constellation of oral organisms associated with human chronic periodontitis. while adaptive immunity to periodontal pathogen proteins has been investigated and is an important component of periodontal bone resorption, the effect of periodontal pathogen dna in eliciting systemic and mucosal antibody and modulating immune responses has not been investigated. methods: rowett rats were locally injected with whole genomic  pg dna in alum. escherichia coli (ec) genomic dna, fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) genomic dna, and saline/alum injected rats served as controls. after various time points, serum igg and salivary iga antibody to ec, fn or pg were detected by elisa. serum and salivary antibody reactions with pg surface antigens were determined by western blot analyses and the specific antigen was identified by mass spectrometry. effects of genomic dna immunization on pg bacterial colonization and experimental periodontal bone resorption were also evaluated. results: sera from pg dna, ec dna and fn dna-injected rats did not react with ec  or fn bacteria. serum igg antibody levels to pg and pg surface extracts were significantly higher in animals immunized with pg dna as compared to the control  groups. rats injected with pg dna demonstrated a strong serum igg and salivary iga antibody reaction solely to pg fimbrillin (41kda), the major protein component of pg fimbriae. in the pg dna-immunized group, the numbers of pg bacteria in oral cavity and the extent of periodontal bone resorption were significantly reduced after pg infection. conclusions: this study suggests that infected hosts may select specific genes from whole genomic dna of the periodontal pathogen for transcription and presentation. the results indicate that the unique gene selected can initiate a host protective immune response to the parent bacterium.

TI  == propeptide-mediated inhibition of cognate gingipain proteinases.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is a major pathogen associated with chronic periodontitis. the organism's cell-surface cysteine proteinases, the arg-specific proteinases (rgpa, rgpb) and the lys-specific proteinase (kgp), which are known as gingipains have been implicated as major virulence factors. all three gingipain precursors contain a propeptide of around 200 amino acids in length that is removed during maturation. the aim of this study was to characterize the  inhibitory potential of the kgp and rgpb propeptides against the mature cognate enzymes. mature kgp was obtained from p. gingivalis mutant ecr368, which produces a recombinant kgp with an abm1 motif deleted from the catalytic domain (rkgp) that enables the otherwise membrane bound enzyme to dissociate from adhesins and  be released. mature rgpb was obtained from p. gingivalis hg66. recombinant propeptides of kgp and rgpb were produced in escherichia coli and purified using  nickel-affinity chromatography. the kgp and rgpb propeptides displayed non-competitive inhibition kinetics with k(i) values of 2.04 microm and 12 nm, respectively. both propeptides exhibited selectivity towards their cognate proteinase. the specificity of both propeptides was demonstrated by their inability to inhibit caspase-3, a closely related cysteine protease, and papain that also has a relatively long propeptide. both propeptides at 100 mg/l caused a 50% reduction of p. gingivalis growth in a protein-based medium. in summary, this study demonstrates that gingipain propeptides are capable of inhibiting their mature cognate proteinases.

TI  == ketoprofen inhibits expression of inflammatory mediators in human dental pulp cells.
AB  == introduction: conventional root canal treatment is the treatment of choice for the irreversible pulpitis caused by bacterial infection. more recently, vital pulp therapy has been proposed as an alternative for management of inflamed dental pulp. ketoprofen is an anti-inflammatory agent commonly used as a component of mouth rinse for oral lesions. here, we examined the effect and mechanisms of action of ketoprofen on the expression of inflammatory mediators induced by the lipopolysaccharide (lps) in dental pulp cells. methods: human dental pulp cells were exposed to lps or lps + ketoprofen, and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to detect interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha. the effect of these treatments on mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways was assessed by western blots for extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-jun n-terminal kinase. results: lps induced interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha in dental pulp cells. ketoprofen effectively inhibited interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha production in lps-stimulated dental pulp cells. notably, ketoprofen inhibited phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-jun n-terminal kinase. conclusions: ketoprofen inhibited expression inflammatory mediators in dental pulp cells stimulated with lps. the inhibitory effect of ketoprofen on inflammatory cytokines is associated with inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.

TI  == role of sodium in the rpry-dependent stress response in porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is a gram-negative oral anaerobe which is strongly associated with periodontal disease. environmental changes in the gingival sulcus trigger the growth of p. gingivalis and a concurrent shift from periodontal health to disease. bacteria adjust their physiology in response to environmental  changes and gene regulation by two-component phospho-relay systems is one mechanism by which such adjustments are effected. in p. gingivalis rpry is an orphan response regulator and previously we showed that the rpry regulon included genes associated with oxidative stress and sodium metabolism. the goals of the present study were to identify environmental signals that induce rpry and clarify the role of the regulator in the stress response. in escherichia coli an rpry-lacz fusion protein was induced in sodium- depleted medium and a p. gingivalis rpry mutant was unable to grow in similar medium. by several approaches we established that sodium depletion induced up-regulation of genes involved in oxidative stress. in addition, we demonstrated that rpry interacted directly with the promoters of several molecular chaperones. further, both genetic and transcription data suggest that the regulator acts as a repressor. we conclude that rpry is one of the regulators that controls stress responses in p.  gingivalis, possibly by acting as a repressor since an rpry mutant showed a superstress reponse in sodium-depleted medium which we propose inhibited growth.

TI  == oxygen deprivation affects the antimicrobial action of ll-37 as determined by microplate real-time kinetic measurements under anaerobic conditions.
AB  == some agents, including escherichia coli and group a streptococcus pyogenes cause  infections in oxygen depleted sites. ll-37 is a human host defence peptide shown  previously to play an important role in controlling infections caused by these bacteria. however, the effect of oxygen levels on the antimicrobial activity of ll-37 remains obscure. in order to test the effect of oxygen (or lack thereof) on ll-37's activity against e. coli and s. pyogenes, a method for adapting commonly  used microtiter plates for real-time growth-kinetic (and growth-inhibition) measurements under anaerobic conditions was developed. using the proposed method, anaerobic conditions were attained in the microplate within 30 min and were maintained for at least five days. anaerobiosis was further confirmed by comparing the growth of two anaerobic oral species (porphyromonas gingivalis and  fusobacterium nucleatum) in anaerobic compartments of microtiter plates versus aerobic ones. both species grew only in the anaerobic compartments of the plates  as indicated by the growth curves generated. the sensitivities of e. coli and s.  pyogenes to ll-37 were tested under anaerobic conditions and compared to those in aerobic ones. the oxygen facultative e. coli grew to a higher density under aerobic conditions and its sensitivity to ll-37 was increased under anaerobiosis. the microaerophilic pathogen s. pyogenes grew faster and to a higher density under anaerobic conditions and was much more resistant to ll-37 under oxygen deprivation. our results suggest that resistance to antimicrobial agents of microbes infecting anaerobic-microaerophilic sites should be tested under oxygen-restricted conditions.

AB  == the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis has two different lipopolysaccharides (lpss) designated o-lps and a-lps, which are a conventional o-antigen polysaccharide and an anionic polysaccharide that are both linked to lipid a-cores, respectively. however, the precise mechanisms of lps biosynthesis  remain to be determined. in this study, we isolated a pigment-less mutant by transposon mutagenesis and identified that the transposon was inserted into the coding sequence pgn_2005, which encodes a hypothetical protein of p. gingivalis atcc 33277. we found that (i) lpss purified from the pgn_2005 mutant were shorter than those of the wild type; (ii) the pgn_2005 protein was located in the inner membrane fraction; and (iii) the pgn_2005 gene conferred wzz activity upon an escherichia coli wzz mutant. these results indicate that the pgn_2005 protein, which was designated wzzp, is a functional homolog of the wzz protein in p. gingivalis. comparison of amino acid sequences among wzzp and conventional wzz proteins indicated that wzzp had an additional fragment at the c-terminal region. in addition, we determined that the pgn_1896 and pgn_1233 proteins and the pgn_1033 protein appear to be wbap homolog proteins and a wzx homolog protein involved in lps biosynthesis, respectively.

TI  == expression profile of macrophage migration-inhibitory factor in human gingiva and reconstituted human gingival epithelia stimulated by porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide.
AB  == background and objective: macrophage migration-inhibitory factor (mif) plays crucial roles in the recruitment and activation of macrophages as well as in helping to kill bacteria. this study investigated the expression profile of mif in human gingiva under different periodontal conditions and its expression patterns induced by porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (lps) in gingival epithelia. material and methods: gingival tissue samples were collected from deep pockets and clinically healthy sites of 22 nonsmoking subjects with chronic periodontitis. the expression of mif mrna and protein was evaluated using real-time pcr and immunohistochemistry, respectively. the in vitro study analyzed the effects of p. gingivalis lps on the expression of mif in a reconstituted human gingival epithelia (rhge) model. results: in gingival epithelia, mif protein was diffusely expressed from the basal layer to the granular and spinous  layers; whereas, in the underlying connective tissues, mif was observed around the dilated blood vessels in the deep-pocket tissues. a significantly lower level of expression of mif mrna and an increased level of expression of mif protein were found in deep-pocket tissues compared with clinically healthy tissues. expression of mif mrna in the rhge model was significantly down-regulated by p. gingivalis lps. conclusion: the present study suggests that mif expression may be related to periodontal conditions and that its expression profile could be modulated by p. gingivalis lps. mif may play a role in periodontal pathogenesis.

TI  == nuclear factor-kappab and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways are critically involved in porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide induction  of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein expression in human oral keratinocytes.
AB  == lipopolysaccharide (lps) -binding protein (lbp) plays a crucial role in innate host response to bacterial challenge. porphyromonas gingivalis is a keystone pathogen in periodontal disease and the shift of p. gingivalis lps lipid a structure from penta-acylated (lps(1690)) to tetra-acylated (lps(1435/1449)) isoform may significantly contribute to periodontal pathogenesis. we recently demonstrated that lbp is expressed in human gingiva and contributes to periodontal homeostasis. furthermore, different isoforms of p. gingivalis lps differently modulate the immuno-inflammatory response, and p. gingivalis lps(1690) induces lbp expression in human oral keratinocytes (hoks). this study further examined the signaling mechanisms of p. gingivalis lps(1690) -induced and escherichia coli lps-induced lbp expression in hoks. both p. gingivalis lps(1690) and e. coli lps were potent inducers of lbp expression in hoks. the former activated phosphorylation of ikappabalpha, p65, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) and stress-activated protein kinase/c-jun n-terminal kinase (sapk/jnk), whereas the latter phosphorylated ikappabalpha, p38 mapk and sapk/jnk. a nuclear translocation of nf-kappab transcription factor was confirmed upon stimulation by both forms of lps. further blocking assay showed that p. gingivalis lps(1690) induction of lbp was through nf-kappab and p38 mpak pathways, whereas e. coli lps-induced lbp expression was mediated by nf-kappab, p38 mpak and jnk pathways. this study demonstrates that nf-kappab and p38 mapk signaling pathways are involved in p. gingivalis lps(1690) induction of lbp expression in hoks. the current findings could enhance the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of innate defense in maintenance of periodontal homeostasis.

TI  == [expression of cytokines of interleukin-6 family in gingival fibroblasts by toll-like receptor-2].
AB  == objective: to investigate whether signaling through toll-like receptor-2 (tlr-2)  can affect the expression of some cytokines in human gingival fibroblasts. methods: the gingival fibroblasts were isolated and cultured in vivo, divided into blank control group, lipopolysaccharide (lps) from porphyromonas gingivalis  (pg) group and escherichia coli (ec) group. mrna expression levels were measured  by real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the protein expression levels were  detected by the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). the data was statistically analyzed by spss16.0 software package. results: lps from pg could stimulate the expression of interleukin (il)-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor (lif) mrna and protein, which reached the peak (5.87 +/- 0.83) at 10 h, and the expression level increased with the increase of the pg concentration. il-11 or oncostatin-m (osm) mrna expression was not affected by lps. after treated with pg for 48 h, the protein expression of il-6 and lif was up-regulated, (962 +/- 57) ng/l and (47 +/- 18) ng/l respectively. conclusions: signaling through tlr-2 controls the expression of cytokines of il-6 family in human gingival fibroblasts.

TI  == identification and characterization of novel glycoproteins involved in growth and biofilm formation by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis has been implicated as a major pathogen associated with  chronic periodontitis. to extend our knowledge of post-translational protein glycosylation in p. gingivalis, a proteomic analysis involving two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis combined with carbohydrate staining and mass spectrometry was performed. four novel glycoproteins, pgn0743, pgn0876, pgn1513 and pgn0729, in p. gingivalis atcc 33277 were identified. these four identified glycoproteins possess a range of biochemical activities and cellular localization. pgn0743 contains a sequence motif identifying it as a fkbp-type cis-trans isomerase, which has activity usually associated with chaperone functions. pgn0876 and pgn1513 contain tetratricopeptide repeat domains that mediate protein-protein interactions. pgn0729 encodes the outer membrane protein  41 precursor, which was previously identified as pgm6, and is homologous to the ompa protein in escherichia coli. several different types of glycoprotein were identified, suggesting that p. gingivalis possesses a general mechanism for protein glycosylation. pgn0743-deficient and pgn0876-deficient mutants were constructed to examine the role(s) of the two identified glycoproteins. both mutants showed a decreased growth rate under nutrient-limited conditions and reduced biofilm formation activity. these results suggest that the novel glycoproteins pgn0743 and pgn0876 play an important role in the growth and colonization of p. gingivalis.

TI  == differential effects of lps from escherichia coli and porphyromonas gingivalis on il-6 production in human periodontal ligament cells.
AB  == objective: periodontal ligament (pdl) cells produce il-6 upon stimulation with inflammation promoters, but the signaling pathways involved have not been characterized. this study investigates underlying mechanisms behind regulation of pdl cell il-6 production by e. coli and p. gingivalis lps. materials and methods: human pdl cells, endothelial cells and monocytes were stimulated with e. coli or  p. gingivalis lps in the presence or absence of pharmacological agents in order to disclose pathways involved in lps signaling. gene expression and cellular protein levels were assessed by quantitative real-time pcr and elisa, respectively. results: stimulation with lps from e. coli (1 microg/ml) for 24 h enhanced pdl cell il-6 expression several fold, demonstrated both on transcript and protein levels, but p. gingivalis lps (1-5 microg/ml) had no effect. tlr2 mrna was more highly expressed than tlr4 transcript in pdl cells. treatment with  the non-selective nitric oxide synthase inhibitor l-name (100 microm) reduced e.  coli lps-induced pdl cell il-6 by 30%, while neither aminoguanidine (10 microm),  an inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase, nor estrogen (17beta-estradiol,  100 nm) influenced il-6. treatment with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (1 microm) totally prevented the e. coli lps-induced pdl cell il-6. in endothelial cells, neither e. coli lps nor p. gingivalis lps promoted il-6 production. in monocytes, serving as positive control, both e. coli and p. gingivalis lps stimulated il-6. conclusions: e. coli lps but not p. gingivalis lps stimulates pdl cell il-6 production through a glucocorticoid-sensitive mechanism involving nitric oxide formation, probably via endothelial nitric oxide synthase.

TI  == putative down-stream signaling molecule of gtpase in porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is a strict anaerobic bacterium mainly responsible for periodontal disease in oral cavity. putative gtpase gene (pgp) of this bacterium  was cloned and its recombinant protein (rpgp) was produced in escherichia coli. based on the amino acid sequence of sgp that is a gtp-binding protein of streptococcus mutans, putative gtpase amino acid sequence was deduced in the data base of genome sequences of porphyromonas gingivalis. a 900-bp pcr fragment was amplified with p. gingivalis genomic dna as a template and cloned into e. coli jm 109. then pgp was transferred into pqe-30 expression vector to make pqe-pgp for production of rpgr. this protein was produced and purified by ni-nta affinity column chromatography. anti-pgp antibody was also produced in sprague dawley rats. using westernblot analysis with this antibody, it was confirmed that the rpgp produced in e. coli was identical to that of donor strain. furthermore, by southernblot analysis it was revealed that the pgp was originated from p. gingivalis. by immunoprecipitation with anti-pgp antibody and n-terminal amino acid sequence analysis it was found that pgp was able to bind to acetate kinase,  which was reported to be a secondary signaling-molecule in anaerobic microorganisms. therefore, these results imply that p. gingivalis produces putative gtpase and this protein might play a potential role in signaling pathway in oral biofilm formation.

TI  == lipopolysaccharide from escherichia coli but not from porphyromonas gingivalis induce pro-inflammatory cytokines and alkaline phosphatase in dental follicle cells.
AB  == objectives: dental follicle cells (dfcs) as periodontal precursor cells are the natural source for cellular therapies of periodontitis. periodontitis is initiated after the infection of the periodontium with oral pathogens such as the gram-negative bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis. lipopolysaccharide (lps) is the  major component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. previous studies have shown that especially p. gingivalis lps induces the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in pdl cells and disturbs the differentiation of dental stem cells. our study investigated the administration of lps to dfcs for the first time. materials and methods: we evaluated cell proliferation (wst1 assay), expression of cytokines il1beta, il8 and il6 (real-time rt-pcr) and the osteogenic differentiation of dfcs (alp-activity and alizarin red staining) in the presence of p. gingivalis lps and escherichia coli lps. results: all tested pro-inflammatory cytokines were highly increased after e. coli lps treatment. p.  gingivalis lps induces only the expression of il8, but this expression was significantly lower than that after e. coli lps administration. the alp activity  was significantly higher in dfcs after the administration of e. coli lps than after administration of p. gingivalis lps or under normal cell differentiation conditions. however, the mineralization was inhibited with lps from both bacterial species. conclusion: lps disturbs osteogenic differentiation in dfcs. moreover, the failure of pro-inflammatory cytokines induction in dfcs after the administration of p. gingivalis lps differs greatly from that of pdl fibroblasts. these immunological properties of dfcs have to be considered for cellular therapies of periodontitis with dfcs.

AB  == objective: this study aimed to evaluate the capacity of whole-genome dna probes prepared from human oral bacteria to cross-react with bacteria from the oral cavity of rats, and to assess the influence of alcohol ingestion on the animals'  oral biofilm. design: twenty four mature wistar rats were equally divided in two  groups. one group (control) was fed balanced diet of rat pellets and water. the alcohol-treated group (at) received the same diet and 20% ethanol solution. upon  euthanasia after 30 days, bacterial samples from the oral biofilm covering the animals' teeth were collected using microbrushes. bacteria identification and quantification were performed using the dna checkerboard hybridization method with 33 probes prepared from human oral bacteria. signals corresponding to bacterial genome counts and percentages were compared using a mann-whitney u test with a significance level <0.05. results: cross-reaction for all targeted species, except streptococcus mutans and streptococcus mitis-like species, occurred in the control group. escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, porphyromonas endodontalis, and veillonella parvula-like species only produced detectable signals in the at group. significantly more signals were detected in the control group compared to the at group (p=0.001). the percentage of e. coli-like species was highest in both groups. conclusions: whole-genome dna probes prepared from human oral bacteria can cross-react with rats' oral bacterial species. alcohol consumption is associated with lower levels and diversity of bacterial species in the oral cavity of rats.

TI  == cytokine production induced by non-encapsulated and encapsulated porphyromonas gingivalis strains.
AB  == objective: although the exact reason is not known, encapsulated gram-negative porphyromonas gingivalis strains are more virulent than non-encapsulated strains. since difference in virulence properties may be due to difference in cytokine production following recognition of the bacteria or their products by the host inflammatory cells, we compared cytokine production following stimulation with bacteria or lipopolysaccharides (lps) of a non-encapsulated and an encapsulated p. gingivalis strain (k(-) and k1). design: tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) production following stimulation of the cell-line mono mac 6 with bacteria or lps of both p. gingivalis strains was determined using flow cytometry. furthermore, we investigated the effects of the two p. gingivalis strains or their lps on tnf-alpha and interleukin (il-1beta, il-6, il-12 and il-10) production in whole blood using luminex. in both experiments, escherichia  coli bacteria and lps were used as a reference. results: both p. gingivalis strains induced lower cytokine production than e. coli with the exception of il-6. p. gingivalis k1 bacteria elicited a higher overall cytokine production than p. gingivalis k(-). in contrast, p. gingivalis k1 lps stimulation induced a  lower cytokine production than p. gingivalis k(-) lps. conclusions: our findings  suggest that the encapsulated p. gingivalis k1 bacteria induce higher cytokine production than the non-encapsulated p. gingivalis k(-). this was not due to its  lps. the stronger induction of cytokines may contribute to the higher virulence of p. gingivalis k1.

TI  == hcpr of porphyromonas gingivalis is required for growth under nitrosative stress  and survival within host cells.
AB  == although the gram-negative, anaerobic periodontopathogen porphyromonas gingivalis must withstand nitrosative stress, which is particularly high in the oral cavity, the mechanisms allowing for protection against such stress are not known in this  organism. in this study, microarray analysis of p. gingivalis transcriptional response to nitrite and nitric oxide showed drastic upregulation of the pg0893 gene coding for hybrid cluster protein (hcp), which is a putative hydroxylamine reductase. although regulation of hcp has been shown to be oxyr dependent in escherichia coli, here we show that in p. gingivalis its expression is dependent  on the fnr-like regulator designated hcpr. growth of the isogenic mutant v2807, containing an ermf-ermam insertion within the hcpr (pg1053) gene, was significantly reduced in the presence of nitrite (p < 0.002) and nitric oxide-generating nitrosoglutathione (gsno) (p < 0.001), compared to that of the wild-type w83 strain. furthermore, the upregulation of pg0893 (hcp) was abrogated in v2807 exposed to nitrosative stress. in addition, recombinant hcpr bound dna containing the hcp promoter sequence, and the binding was hemin dependent. finally, v2807 was not able to survive with host cells, demonstrating that hcpr plays an important role in p. gingivalis virulence. this work gives insight into  the molecular mechanisms of protection against nitrosative stress in p. gingivalis and shows that the regulatory mechanisms differ from those in e. coli.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis lps stimulates the expression of lps-binding protein in  human oral keratinocytes in vitro.
AB  == lps-binding protein (lbp) functions as a crucial molecule in innate immune responses to bacterial challenge. our study has shown the expression of lbp in human gingiva and its significant association with periodontal health and disease. porphyromonas gingivalis is a key pathogen of periodontal disease. p. gingivalis lps as a main virulence factor is strongly involved in periodontal pathogenesis and it displays a significant lipid a structural heterogeneity. currently, it remains unknown whether, and to what extent, the lipid a structural heterogeneity of p. gingivalis lps affects lbp expression. the present study investigated the expression profile of lbp in human oral keratinocytes (hoks) stimulated by two isoforms of p. gingivalis lps [tetra- (lps(1435/1449)) and penta-acylated (lps(1690))] and escherichia coli lps, and the involvement of tlrs in lbp expression. the results showed that the expression of lbp mrna and peptide was significantly up-regulated by p. gingivalis lps(1690) and e. coli lps, while  p. gingivalis lps(1435/1449) did not affect lbp expression. blocking assay and sirna gene silencing revealed that p. gingivalis lps(1690)-induced lbp expression was through both tlr2 and tlr4. this in vitro study demonstrates that p. gingivalis lps with a lipid a structural heterogeneity differentially modulates lbp expression in hoks.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide induces mir-146a without altering the production of inflammatory cytokines.
AB  == lipopolysaccharide (lps) from porphyromonas gingivalis, an oral gram-negative bacterium, acts as a virulence factor for periodontal disease. although p. gingivalis lps does not induce proinflammatory cytokines as strongly as escherichia coli lps, it is still able to exploit negative toll-like receptor (tlr) regulatory pathways and facilitate pathogen persistence. recent reports suggest that micrornas (mirnas) are also involved in the regulation of tlr signaling. here, we demonstrate that p. gingivalis lps strongly induces mirna-146a expression in thp-1 cells and thp-1-derived macrophages. however, the  inhibition or overexpression of mir-146a, through the transfection of a specific  inhibitor or precursor, respectively, had little effect on cytokine production in macrophages stimulated with p. gingivalis lps. moreover, the expression of interleukin-1 associated-kinase-1 (irak-1) and tumor-necrosis factor (tnf) receptor-associated factor-6 (traf6), potential target molecules of mir-146a, were not affected by the stimulation with p. gingivalis lps. because tlr signaling induces various negative regulators, these results call into question the role of mir-146a in cells stimulated with tlr ligands.

AB  == background: the antimicrobial peptide ll-37 is known to have a potent lipopolysaccharide (lps)-neutralizing activity in various cell types. because of  observed heterogeneity within periodontopathogenic lps, the authors hypothesized  that ll-37 had specificity to neutralize such lps activity. the present study, therefore, aims to investigate the lps-neutralizing activity of ll-37 to various  periodontopathogenic lps in interleukin-8 (il-8) production after challenging them in human oral fibroblasts. methods: human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (pdlf) and gingival fibroblasts (gf) were cultured from biopsies of periodontal ligament and gingival tissues. after cell confluence in 24-well plates, lps (10 mug/ml) from porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans were added with or without ll-37 (10 mug/ml). after 18 hours, the supernatant was collected and analyzed in  il-8 production by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: all periodontopathogenic lps statistically significantly induced il-8 production in both pdlf and gf (p <0.01). after neutralization with ll-37, both pdlf and gf showed a statistically significant reduction in il-8 production compared with lps-treated groups without ll-37 (p <0.01), and the percentage of reduction in il-8 production in pdlf appeared to be higher than in gf. in addition, the percentage of reduction in il-8 production varied considerably according to each  periodontopathogenic lps. conclusions: the antimicrobial peptide ll-37 had an ability to suppress periodontopathogenic lps-induced il-8 production in both pdlf and gf. its lps-neutralizing activity revealed specificity to periodontopathogenic lps and seemed to be dependent on the heterogeneity within lps between different genera.

TI  == both the unique and repeat regions of the porphyromonas gingivalis hemagglutin a  are involved in adhesion and invasion of host cells.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is one of the major etiologic agents of adult periodontitis and has been associated with cardiovascular diseases. it expresses  multiple hemagglutinins that are significant virulence factors and play an important role in bacterial attachment and invasion of host cells. the objective  of this study was to determine the impact of p. gingivalis hemagglutinin a (haga) on the attachment to and invasion of human coronary artery endothelial cells (hcaec) and gingival epithelial cells (gec). bacterial strains expressing the haga protein (or subunits), including escherichia coli carrying plasmid peks5, e. coli carrying plasmid st2, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium with plasmid pnm1.1 were used in this study. the strains were tested for their ability to attach to and invade hcaec and gec using antibiotic protection assays. in addition, the unique 5' n-terminal non-repeated segment of haga was purified in recombinant form and a monoclonal antibody was created against the polypeptide. the monoclonal antibody against the unique portion of haga was tested for inhibitory activity in these assays. the attachment of both e. coli strains expressing haga fragment to host cells was significantly increased compared to their respective controls. however, they did not invade gec or hcaec. interestingly, haga expression in the salmonella strain increased both adherence  to and invasion of hcaec, which may be due to the presence of the entire haga orf. a monoclonal antibody against the unique 5' n-terminal portion of haga reduced invasion. further experiments are needed to determine the role of the unique and the repeat segments of p. gingivalis haga.

TI  == porphyromonas endodontalis lipopolysaccharides induce rankl by mouse osteoblast in a way different from that of escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide.
AB  == introduction: porphyromonas endodontalis lipopolysaccharide (lps) has been shown  to have a high positive rate in infected root canals and symptomatic apical periodontitis. it may play an integral role as a potent stimulator of inflammatory cytokines involved in apical lesions. the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappab ligand (rankl) has been proven to be the key regulator of bone remodeling. this study investigated p. endodontalis lps-induced rankl production and lps signaling in mouse osteoblasts. methods: lps-induced rankl production in mouse osteoblast mc3t3-e1 cells was measured by western blot and real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the toll-like receptors (tlrs) were determined by the blocking test using anti-tlrs antibodies. in addition, specific inhibitors were used to analyze the intracellular signaling pathways. escherichia coli lps was used as the control. results: both of the anti-tlr2 and anti-tlr4 antibodies significantly (p < .05) inhibited the expression of rankl from osteoblasts stimulated with p. endodontalis lps; only anti-tlr2 antibody had a significant (p < .05) inhibitory effect on e. coli lps signaling. sp600125 (c-jun n-terminal kinase [jnk] inhibitor) prevented the up-regulation of rankl expression in p. endodontalis lps-infected osteoblasts (p < .05). the inhibitory  effect of wortmannin (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor) and pd98059 (mitogen-activated protein kinase [mapk]/extracellular signal-regulated kinase [erk] kinase-1/2 [mek 1/2] inhibitor) were observed in e. coli lps-treated mouse  osteoblasts (p < .05). conclusions: results from this study showed that p. endodontalis lps has the ability to promote the expression of rankl in mouse osteoblasts, and this induction was mainly through the tlr2/4-jnk signaling pathway, a situation quite different from that of typical bacterial endotoxin (e. coli lps).

TI  == ompa-like protein influences cell shape and adhesive activity of tannerella forsythia.
AB  == tannerella forsythia, a gram-negative fusiform rod, is implicated in several types of oral anaerobic infections. most gram-negative bacteria have ompa-like proteins that are homologous to the ompa protein in escherichia coli. we identified an ompa-like protein in t. forsythia encoded by the tf1331 gene as one of the major proteins by mass spectrometric analysis. two-dimensional, diagonal electrophoresis showed that the ompa-like protein formed a dimeric or trimeric structure via intermolecular disulfide bonds. a biotin labeling experiment revealed that a portion of the protein was exposed on the cell surface, even though t. forsythia possesses an s-layer at the outermost cell surface. using a tf1331-deletion mutant, we showed that the ompa-like protein affected cell morphology. the length of the mutant cell was reduced almost by half. cell swelling was observed in more than 40% of the mutant cells. moreover, the mutant  exhibited decreased adhesion to fibronectin, retarded autoaggregation, and reduced cell surface hydrophobicity. these results suggest that the ompa-like protein in t. forsythia plays an important role in cellular integrity and adhesive function.

TI  == community-based interference against integration of pseudomonas aeruginosa into human salivary microbial biofilm.
AB  == as part of the human gastrointestinal tract, the oral cavity represents a complex biological system and harbors diverse bacterial species. unlike the gut microbiota, which is often considered a health asset, studies of the oral commensal microbiota have been largely limited to their implication in oral conditions such as dental caries and periodontal disease. less emphasis has been  given to their potential beneficial roles, especially the protective effects against oral colonization by foreign or pathogenic bacteria. in this study, we used salivary microbiota derived from healthy human subjects to investigate protective effects against colonization and integration of pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic bacterial pathogen, into developing or pre-formed salivary biofilms. when co-cultivated in saliva medium, p. aeruginosa persisted in the planktonic phase, but failed to integrate into the salivary microbial community during biofilm formation. furthermore, in saliva medium supplemented with sucrose, the oral microbiota inhibited the growth of p. aeruginosa by producing lactic acid. more interestingly, while pre-formed salivary biofilms were able to prevent p. aeruginosa colonization, the same biofilms recovered from mild chlorhexidine gluconate treatment displayed a shift in microbial composition and showed a drastic reduction in protection. our study indicates that normal oral communities with balanced microbial compositions could be important in effectively preventing the integration of foreign or pathogenic bacterial species, such as p. aeruginosa.

AB  == microbial components activate the host's innate immunity via interactions with molecules including tlrs and nods. we previously reported that in mice (i) escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (lps; tlr4 agonist) promotes ni-allergy even  in t-cell-deficient mice, (ii) e. coli lps reduces the minimum allergy-inducing concentrations of ni at both the sensitization and elicitation steps, and (iii) various microbe-related substances promote sensitization to ni. here, we examined the effects of microbe-related substances at the elicitation step. mice (except for tlr4-mutated c3h/hej mice) were sensitized to ni by intraperitoneal injection of nicl(2) + e. coli lps. ten days later their ear-pinnas were challenged with 1  mum nicl(2) with or without a test substance. although nicl(2) alone at this concentration does not induce ni-allergy, its combination with the following substances induced ni-allergy in balb/c mice: lps preparations from oral gram-negative bacteria (prevotella intermedia and porphyromonas gingivalis), a mannan preparation from a fungus (saccharomyces cerevisiae), and synthetic nod2 and tlr2 agonists. the effect of the mannan preparation was small in c3h/hej mice (sensitized with nicl(2) + the p. intermedia preparation). the p. intermedia preparation promoted ni-allergy in c3h/hej and nude mice, but not in mice deficient in either tlr2 or histidine decarboxylase. intragingival injection of the p. intermedia preparation and later challenge with nicl(2) alone to ear-pinnas also promoted ni-allergy. these results indicate that (i) in ni-allergy, a microbial milieu or innate immunity is important at the elicitation step, too, and (ii) some oral bacteria may promote ni-allergy via tlr2-stimulant(s) production.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide lipid a heterogeneity differentially  modulates the expression of il-6 and il-8 in human gingival fibroblasts.
AB  == aim: porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (lps) displays a significant amount of structural heterogeneity, containing both tetra- (lps(1435/1449) ) and  penta-acylated (lps(1690) ) lipid a structures. this study investigated the effects of the two isoforms of p. gingivalis lps on the expression of il-6, il-8  and tnf-alpha in human gingival fibroblasts (hgfs). materials and methods: hgfs were stimulated with p. gingivalis lps(1435/1449) and lps(1690) in both dose- (1  ng-10 mug/ml) and time-dependent (2-48 h) experiments. total rna and protein were extracted and used for analysis of the il-6, il-8 and tnf-alpha transcripts as well as il-6 and il-8 proteins, by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. results: p. gingivalis lps(1690) significantly up-regulated the mrna and protein expression of il-6 and il-8, whereas p. gingivalis lps(1435/1449) did not induce significant host response. the expression levels of il-6 and il-8 up-regulated by p. gingivalis lps(1690) continuously increased with time course. in contrast, tnf-alpha transcript expression was up-regulated promptly by p. gingivalis lps(1690) after 2 h of stimulation and gradually declined afterwards. conclusions: this study suggests that p. gingivalis lps heterogeneity may differentially modulate the pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in hgfs, which may contribute to periodontal pathogenesis.

TI  == comparative effects of the immediate and the extended release formulations of ciprofloxacin on normal human intestinal microflora.
AB  == ciprofloxacin is a well-known fluoroquinolone, active in vitro against most gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the ecological effects of an orally administered extended-release formulation of ciprofloxacin in comparison with an immediate-release formulation  of ciprofloxacin on the normal human intestinal microflora. thirty-six healthy female subjects were included in the study. the extended-release formulation of ciprofloxacin was given as 500 mg once daily and the immediate-release formulation as 250 mg twice daily. the treatment period was 3 days. the microbiological investigation was blinded with respect to treatment. mean fecal concentration in the volunteers receiving the extended-release formulation ciprofloxacin was 453 mg/kg and in the immediate-release formulation ciprofloxacin volunteers, the mean fecal concentration was 392 mg/kg. the numbers of escherichia coli were significantly suppressed while the enterococci decreased moderately in both treatment groups. no toxigenic clostridium difficile strains were found. no major differences were observed between the two studied formulations on the normal human intestinal microflora.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis muty is involved in the repair of oxidative stress-induced dna mispairing.
AB  == the ability for dna mismatch repair, after oxidative stress-induced dna damage, is critical for the persistence of porphyromonas gingivalis in the inflammatory environment of the periodontal pocket. our previous report demonstrated that, in  contrast to other organisms, the repair of oxidative stress-induced dna damage involving 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxog) may occur by a yet-to-be described mechanism in p. gingivalis. 8-oxog does not block dna replication; rather, it mispairs with adenine, which can be repaired by the muty glycosylase. to determine the function of the p. gingivalis muty homologue in dna repair, it was  insertionally inactivated using the ermf-ermam antibiotic cassette and used to create a muty-deficient mutant (fll147) by allelic exchange mutagenesis. fll147 had an increased rate of spontaneous mutation and was more sensitive to hydrogen  peroxide compared with the wild-type w83 strain. dna oligomers containing a site-specific 8-oxog:a mispair was repaired similarly in both the p. gingivalis muty-defective mutant and wild-type strains. the p. gingivalis muty homologue was shown to complement the muty mutation in escherichia coli. in a gel mobility shift assay, the purified recombinant muty is able to bind an oligo containing an 8-oxog:a mispair. taken together, muty may play the expected role in oxidative stress resistance in p. gingivalis. however, there may exist other redundant mechanism(s) for the removal of 8-oxog:a mismatch in this organism.

TI  == association of red complex, a. actinomycetemcomitans and non-oral bacteria with periodontal diseases.
AB  == objective: pathogens related to systemic infections have been detected in the periodontal microbiota. the relationship amongst these pathogens, periodontal bacteria and periodontal clinical status is poorly understood. this study evaluated the association amongst red complex, a. actinomycetemcomitans (a.a) and non-oral pathogenic bacteria in subjects with good periodontal health (ph), gingivitis (g), chronic (cp) and aggressive (ap) periodontitis. methods: subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 51 ph, 42 g, 219 cp and 90 ap subjects. the presence and levels of a.a, red complex (porphyromonas gingivalis,  tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola), acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia  coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus were determined by dna probes and dna-dna hybridization technique. results: cp and ap subjects presented significantly higher prevalence and levels of a.a, red  complex and a. baumannii than g and ph individuals (p<0.01), whereas s. aureus was detected in lower frequency and counts in ap as compared to the other groups  (p<0.001). the predictor variables age, prevalence of red complex, and the presence of a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa were strongly associated with the frequency of sites with pd and cal >/=5 mm. increasing age (or 1.08), high frequency of red complex (or 6.10), and the presence of a.a with p. aeruginosa (or 1.90) were associated with periodontal disease (p<0.001). subjects harbouring a high prevalence of a.a, a. baumannii, and red complex with p. aeruginosa were more likely to have ap than cp (p<0.001). conclusion: putative periodontal pathogens and non-oral bacteria alone or in association were strongly associated  with periodontitis.

TI  == stimulants of toll-like receptors 2 and 4 are elevated in saliva of periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects.
AB  == aim: because the absorption of stimulants of toll-like receptor (tlr)2 and tlr4 from the gastrointestinal tract into the circulation has been proposed to promote the development of atherosclerosis and insulin resistance, we aimed to quantify the abundance of stimulants of tlr2 and tlr4 in human saliva. methods: a recently developed bioassay based upon measurement of nf-kappab activation in tlr-deficient human embryonic kidney (hek)-293 cells transfected with human tlr2  or tlr4 and calibrated with synthetic bacterial lipopeptide (pam(3) csk(4) ) or escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (lps), was used to establish the normal range of tlr stimulants in saliva of 20 healthy subjects and 20 subjects with periodontal disease. results: median soluble stimulants of tlr2 and tlr4 were significantly higher in saliva of periodontitis patients compared with saliva of  healthy subjects; 3450 versus 77 ng/ml pam(3) csk(4) equivalents (p<0.0001) and 138 versus 7 ng/ml lps equivalents, respectively (p<0.0001). salivary tlr stimulant levels remained relatively stable in healthy subjects over several days. six strains of oral gram-negative bacteria, including tannerella forsythensis, lysobacter enzymogenes, prevotella intermedia, prevotella oris and  porphyromonas gingivalis, from a panel of nine examined did not stimulate tlr4-dependent signalling. conclusions: elevated salivary tlr stimulants may represent a novel mechanism by which periodontitis increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and insulin resistance.

TI  == the bcp gene in the bcp-reca-vima-vime-vimf operon is important in oxidative stress resistance in porphyromonas gingivalis w83.
AB  == the ability of porphyromonas gingivalis to overcome oxidative stress in the inflammatory environment of the periodontal pocket is critical for its survival.  we have previously demonstrated that the reca locus, which carries the bacterioferritin co-migratory protein (bcp) gene and has a unique genetic architecture, plays a role in virulence regulation and oxidative stress resistance in p. gingivalis. to further characterize the bcp gene, which was confirmed to be part of the bcp-reca-vima-vime-vimf operon, we created a p. gingivalis bcp-defective isogenic mutant (fll302) by allelic exchange. compared with the wild-type, fll302 had a similar growth rate, black pigmentation, beta-hemolysis and uv sensitivity. although there was no change in the distribution of gingipain activity, there was a 30% reduction in both arg-x and lys-x activities in the mutant strain compared with the wild-type. when exposed to 0.25 mm hydrogen peroxide, p. gingivalis fll302 was more sensitive than the wild-type. in addition, the cloned p. gingivalis bcp gene increased resistance to 0.25 mm hydrogen peroxide in a bcp-defective escherichia coli mutant. the mutant  also demonstrated decreased aerotolerance when compared with the wild-type. porphyromonas gingivalis fll302 and the wild-type strain had similar virulence profiles in a mouse model of virulence. these observations suggest that the bcp gene may play a role in oxidative stress resistance but has a decreased functional significance in the pathogenic potential of p. gingivalis.

TI  == nasal immunization with a fusion protein consisting of the hemagglutinin a antigenic region and the maltose-binding protein elicits cd11c(+) cd8(+) dendritic cells for induced long-term protective immunity.
AB  == we assessed the efficacy of a fusion protein consisting of the 25-kda antigenic region of porphyromonas gingivalis hemagglutinin a and the escherichia coli maltose-binding protein (25k-haga-mbp) as a nasal vaccine for the prevention of oral infection with p. gingivalis. nasal immunization with 25k-haga-mbp induced high levels of 25k-haga-specific serum igg, serum iga, and salivary iga antibodies in a toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4)-dependent manner. these antibody responses were maintained for at least 1 year after immunization. analysis of cytokine responses showed that nasal administration of 25k-haga-mbp induced antigen-specific cd4(+) t cells producing interleukin 4 (il-4) and il-5, but not  gamma interferon (ifn-gamma), in the spleen and cervical lymph nodes (clns). furthermore, increased numbers of cd11c(+) cd8alpha(+), but not cd11c(+) cd11b(+) or cd11c(+) b220(+), dendritic cells with upregulated expression of cd80, cd86, cd40, and major histocompatibility complex class ii (mhc ii) molecules were noted in the spleen, clns, and nasopharynx-associated lymphoreticular tissues (nalt). interestingly, when 25k-haga-mbp or cholera toxin (ct) was given intranasally to  enable examination of their presence in neuronal tissues, the amounts of 25k-haga-mbp were significantly lower than those of ct. importantly, mice given 25k-haga-mbp nasally showed a significant reduction in alveolar bone loss caused  by oral infection with p. gingivalis, even 1 year after the immunization. these results suggest that 25k-haga-mbp administered nasally would be an effective and  safe mucosal vaccine against p. gingivalis infection and may be an important tool for the prevention of chronic periodontitis in humans.

TI  == recombinant porphyromonas gingivalis fima preproprotein expressed in escherichia  coli is lipidated and the mature or processed recombinant fima protein forms a short filament in vitro.
AB  == the gram-negative anaerobic bacterium porphyromonas gingivalis is an etiologically important pathogen for chronic periodontal diseases in adults. our  previous study suggested that the major structural components of both fim and mfa fimbriae in this organism are secreted through their lipidated precursors. in this study, we constructed escherichia coli strains expressing various fima genes with or without the 5'-terminal dna region encoding the signal peptide, and we determined whether lipidation of recombinant fima proteins occurred in e. coli. lipidation occurred for a recombinant protein from the fima gene with the 5'-terminal dna region encoding the signal peptide but not for a recombinant protein from the fima gene without the signal-peptide-encoding region, as revealed by [3h]palmitic acid labeling experiments. a tlr2-dependent signaling response was induced by the recombinant protein from the fima gene with the signal-peptide-encoding region but not by a recombinant protein from the fima gene with the signal-peptide-encoding region that had a base substitution causing an amino acid substitution (c19a). electron microscopic analysis revealed that recombinant fima (a-47 - w-383) protein was autopolymerized to form filamentous structures of about 80 nm in length in vitro. the results suggest that fima protein, a major subunit of fim fimbriae, is transported to the outer membrane by the lipoprotein sorting system, and a mature or processed fima protein on the outer membrane is autopolymerized to form fim fimbriae.

TI  == the lipid a phosphate position determines differential host toll-like receptor 4  responses to phylogenetically related symbiotic and pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == the human symbiont bacteroides thetaiotaomicron promotes intestinal function and  health, whereas the phylogenetically related pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis is associated with the chronic oral inflammatory disease periodontitis. although both b. thetaiotaomicron and p. gingivalis synthesize lipopolysaccharides (lps) consisting of penta-acylated, monophosphorylated lipid a in addition to immunologically silent, nonphosphorylated lipid a, they elicit strikingly distinct toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4) responses. we show that the phosphate position of penta-acylated, monophosphorylated lipid a is a key feature for determining the differential tlr4 responses elicited by these evolutionarily related bacteria. b. thetaiotaomicron produces tlr4-stimulatory lipid a bearing a 1-phosphate, in contrast to p. gingivalis, which produces tlr4-evasive lipid a bearing a 4'-phosphate. confirming these observations, recombinant escherichia coli lps containing penta-acylated, 1-phosphorylated lipid a is more tlr4 stimulatory than lps containing 4'-phosphorylated lipid a. the specific capacity  of a gram-negative bacterium to alert or evade the host innate immune defense system through tlr4-dependent signaling is currently recognized as a critical aspect defining the relationship between the host and the bacterium. we propose that the distinct lipid a phosphate positions observed for the b. thetaiotaomicron and p. gingivalis lps contributes to the manifestation of these  bacteria as commensal or pathogen within the human host.

TI  == oxygen tension modulates the cytokine response of oral epithelium to periodontal  bacteria.
AB  == background: there is an inverse relationship between pocket depth and pocket oxygen tension with deep pockets being associated with anaerobic bacteria. however, little is known about how the host tissues respond to bacteria under differing oxygen tensions within the periodontal pocket. aim: to investigate the  effect of different oxygen tensions upon nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappab) activation and the inflammatory cytokine response of oral epithelial cells when exposed to nine species of oral bacteria. materials and methods: h400 oral epithelial cells were equilibrated at 2%, 10% or 21% oxygen. cells were stimulated with heat-killed oral bacteria at multiplicity of infection 10:1, escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (15 mug/ml) or vehicle control. interleukin-8 (il-8) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and nf-kappab activation was measured by reporter vector or by immunohistochemical analysis. results: tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia elicited the greatest epithelial nf-kappab activation and cytokine responses. an oxygen-tension-dependent trend in cytokine production was observed with the highest il-8 and tnf-alpha production observed at 2% oxygen and lowest at 21% oxygen. conclusions: these data demonstrate a greater pro-inflammatory host response and cell signalling response to bacteria present in more anaerobic conditions, and hypersensitivity of epithelial cells to pro-inflammatory stimuli  at 2% oxygen, which may have implications for disease pathogenesis and/or therapy.

TI  == differential cytokine patterns in mouse macrophages and gingival fibroblasts after stimulation with porphyromonas gingivalis or escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide.
AB  == background: a major cause of chronic inflammatory periodontal disease is porphyromonas gingivalis, a non-motile, gram-negative, rod-shaped, anaerobic bacterium. within gingival tissue, both macrophages and fibroblasts participate in the immune response to foreign entities by releasing cytokines and expressing  molecules to recruit and activate lymphocytes. however, the contribution of gingival macrophages and fibroblasts to the immune response to p. gingivalis infection is not fully known. methods: the amj2-c8 cell line (am cells), a mouse  alveolar macrophage cell line, and esk-1 cells, a mouse gingival fibroblast cell  line made in our laboratory, were treated with lipopolysaccharide (lps) from either p. gingivalis or escherichia coli. the expression of immune response molecules was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunoassay. results: am and esk-1 cells responded differently to p. gingivalis and e. coli lps stimulation. the esk-1 gingival fibroblast cell line was more responsive to e. coli lps stimulation as seen by elevated levels of interleukin (il)-6, inducible nitric oxide, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 expression relative to stimulation by p. gingivalis lps. conversely, the am macrophage cell  line was more responsive to p. gingivalis lps stimulation, particularly for interleukin il-1beta, il-6, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1, relative to stimulation by e. coli lps. conclusion: these findings demonstrate that e. coli lps induces a stronger cytokine and chemokine response in gingival fibroblasts, whereas p. gingivalis lps induces a stronger response in macrophages.

TI  == study of the direct bactericidal effect of nd:yag and diode laser parameters used in endodontics on pigmented and nonpigmented bacteria.
AB  == laser light can be used during endodontic procedures to sterilize the root canal  by destroying bacteria. previous in-vitro studies that investigated the mechanism of the destruction of bacteria inhabiting the root canal by 1,064-nm nd:yag and 808-nm diode laser light used substrates that absorb light in the near-infrared (nir) spectrum. these substrates heat the bacterial microenvironment, which possibly contributes to cell death. to determine the direct effect of laser light on the bacterial sample in the absence of detrimental heating, a sapphire substrate, which is virtually transparent in nir spectrum, was inoculated with bacterial samples and subjected to laser irradiation at 1,064 nm (1.5 w, 15 hz) and at 808 nm (1.5 w, 20 hz). enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and porphyromonas gingivalis bacteria were used. e. faecalis and e. coli were largely unaffected by laser light. the viability of p. gingivalis, a pigmented bacterium, was directly affected by both nir wavelengths (a 57% decrease of viability at 1,064 nm and a 31% decrease at 808 nm). our results indicate that the primary mediator of cell death appears to be the interaction between nir laser light and  the bacterial microenvironment, most likely in the form of heating. our research  suggests that when optimizing the efficacy of laser-assisted endodontic sterilization of the root canal, the optical characteristics of the bacterial microenvironment play a key role, as nonpigmented bacteria appear to be virtually transparent at 808 nm and 1,064 nm.

TI  == nuclear factor-kappab p50 subunits in chronic periodontitis and porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide-pulsed dendritic cells.
AB  == the pathogenesis of a number of chronic inflammatory diseases has been linked to  dysregulated functioning of nuclear transcription factor (nf)-kappab. in the present study, we examine nf-kappab activation in human oral mucosal tissues of chronic periodontitis (cp) patients. electrophoretic mobility shift assay and dna-binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays indicate elevated levels of transcriptionally repressive p50 subunits and an increased p50/p65 ratio in cp tissues compared to healthy controls. because porphyromonas gingivalis has been recognized to be a causal factor in cp, we used p. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide  (lps) for in vitro studies with monocyte-derived dendritic cells (modcs). porphyromonas gingivalis lps, unlike escherichia coli lps, induced an increased p50/p65 ratio in modcs. using blocking antibodies, we demonstrated that while both toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2) and tlr4 are required for modc maturation by p.  gingivalis lps, only tlr4 signaling is sufficient to induce cytokine secretion. our results suggest that increased levels of transcriptionally repressive p50 may be characteristic of cp and might be a result of suboptimal nf-kappab activation  and dendritic cell maturation by p. gingivalis, a bacterium implicated in cp.

AB  == background and objective: tobacco use is associated with increased periodontal destruction in both cigarette smokers and smokeless tobacco users. gingival keratinocytes are the first cells in contact with microbial and tobacco components and play a key role in the innate immune response to these agents. the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of nicotine and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps) alone and in combination on gingival keratinocyte production of interleukin-1 alpha (il-1 alpha) and interleukin-8 (il-8). material and methods: gingival keratinocyte cultures were established from 10 healthy, non-tobacco-using subjects. the cells were stimulated for 24 h with 1 mum or 1 mm nicotine and/or 10 microg/ml escherichia coli or porphyromonas gingivalis lps. interleukin-1 alpha and il-8 proteins were quantified using elisas. results: compared with untreated cultures, 1 mm nicotine stimulated production of il-1 alpha (p < 0.001); e. coli and p. gingivalis lps increased il-8 production (p = 0.0014 and p = 0.0232, respectively). a combination of nicotine and lps produced  the highest cytokine quantities. amounts of il-1 alpha and il-8 following 1 mm nicotine and lps exposure were significantly greater than in untreated cultures (p < 0.001). interleukin-8 was also responsive to 0.1 mum nicotine combined with  e. coli or p. gingivalis lps compared with control cultures (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0029, respectively). both cytokines tended to be elevated following the combined treatment relative to nicotine or lps treatment alone. conclusion: these results demonstrate that nicotine and lps differentially regulate il-1 and il-8 production by gingival keratinocytes. combined treatment tended to elevate cytokine production further, which may have implications for the progression of periodontitis in tobacco users.

TI  == adpc is a prevotella intermedia 17 leucine-rich repeat internalin-like protein.
AB  == the oral bacterium prevotella intermedia attaches to and invades gingival epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. several genes encoding proteins that mediate both the adhesion and invasion processes are carried on the genome of this bacterium. here, we characterized one such protein, adpc, belonging to the leucine-rich repeat (lrr) protein family. bioinformatics analysis revealed that this protein shares similarity with the treponema pallidum lrr (lrr(tp)) family of proteins and contains six lrrs. despite the absence of a  signal peptide, this protein is localized on the bacterial outer membrane, indicating that it is transported through an atypical secretion mechanism. the recombinant form of this protein (radpc) was shown to bind fibrinogen. in addition, the heterologous host strain escherichia coli bl21 expressing radpc (v2846) invaded fibroblast nih 3t3 cells at a 40-fold-higher frequency than control e. coli bl21 cells expressing a sham p. intermedia 17 protein. although similar results were obtained by using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvecs), only a 3-fold-increased invasion of v2846 into oral epithelial hn4 cells was observed. thus, adpc-mediated invasion is cell specific. this work demonstrated that adpc is an important invasin protein of p. intermedia 17.

TI  == a novel sialic acid utilization and uptake system in the periodontal pathogen tannerella forsythia.
AB  == tannerella forsythia is a key contributor to periodontitis, but little is known of its virulence mechanisms. in this study we have investigated the role of sialic acid in biofilm growth of this periodontal pathogen. our data show that biofilm growth of t. forsythia is stimulated by sialic acid, glycolyl sialic acid, and sialyllactose, all three of which are common sugar moieties on a range  of important host glycoproteins. we have also established that growth on sialyllactose is dependent on the sialidase of t. forsythia since the sialidase inhibitor oseltamivir suppresses growth on sialyllactose. the genome of t. forsythia contains a sialic acid utilization locus, which also encodes a putative inner membrane sialic acid permease (nant), and we have shown this is functional  when it is expressed in escherichia coli. this genomic locus also contains a putatively novel tonb-dependent outer membrane sialic acid transport system (tf0033-tf0034). in complementation studies using an escherichia coli strain devoid of its outer membrane sialic acid transporters, the cloning and expression of the tf0033-tf0034 genes enabled an e. coli nanr nanc ompr strain to utilize sialic acid as the sole carbon and energy source. we have thus identified a novel sialic acid uptake system that couples an inner membrane permease with a tonb-dependent outer membrane transporter, and we propose to rename these novel sialic acid uptake genes nano and nanu, respectively. taken together, these data  indicate that sialic acid is a key growth factor for this little-characterized oral pathogen and may be key to its physiology in vivo.

TI  == mapk signaling is required for lps-induced vegf in pulp stem cells.
AB  == caries-induced pulpitis is typically accompanied by an increase in dental pulp microvascular density. however, the mechanisms by which dental pulp cells recognize lipopolysaccharides (lpss) remain unclear. we hypothesized that porphyromonas endodontalis and escherichia coli lpss induce vascular endothelial  growth factor (vegf) expression in dental pulp stem cells (dpsc) and human dental pulp fibroblasts (hdpf) through mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) signaling. elisa, semi-quantitative rt-pcr, immunofluorescence, and western blots were used. here, we observed that lpss induced vegf expression in dpsc and hdpf cells, and both cell types express toll-like receptor 4 (tlr- 4). notably, lps-induced vegf is associated with phosphorylation of protein kinase c (pkc zeta) and extracellular signal-regulator kinase (erk1/2) and is dependent upon mapk activation. analysis of these data, collectively, unveils a signaling pathway responsible for synthesis of vegf by pulp cells and suggests a novel therapeutic target for the management of vascular responses in teeth with pulpitis.

AB  == matrix metalloproteinase-9 (mmp-9) cleaves collagen, allowing leukocytes to traffic toward the vasculature and the lymphatics. when mmp-9 is unregulated by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (timp-1), this can lead to tissue destruction. dendritic cells (dcs) infiltrate the oral mucosa increasingly in chronic periodontitis, characterized by infection with several pathogens including porphyromonas gingivalis. in this study, human monocyte-derived dcs were pulsed with different doses of lipopolysaccharide of p. gingivalis 381 and of escherichia coli type strain 25922, as well as whole live isogenic fimbriae-deficient mutant strains of p. gingivalis 381. levels of induction of mmp-9 and timp-1, as well as interleukin-10 (il-10), which reportedly inhibits mmp-9 induction, were measured by several approaches. our results reveal that lipopolysaccharide of p. gingivalis, compared with lipopolysaccharide from e. coli type strain 25922, is a relatively potent inducer of mmp-9, but a weak inducer of timp-1, contributing to a high mmp-9/timp-1 ratio.whole live p. gingivalis strain 381, major fimbriae mutant dpg-3 and double mutant mfb were potent inducers of mmp-9, but minor fimbriae mutant mfi was not. mmp-9 induction  was inversely proportional to il-10 induction. these results suggest that lipopolysaccharide and the minor and the major fimbriae of p. gingivalis may play distinct roles in induction by dcs of mmp-9, a potent mediator of local tissue destruction and leukocyte trafficking.

TI  == characterization of l-cysteine desulfhydrase from prevotella intermedia.
AB  == introduction: hydrogen sulfide is responsible for lysis of red blood cells and is a major compound for oral malodor. to clarify the production mechanism of hydrogen sulfide in prevotella intermedia, we found an l-cysteine desulfhydrase gene (lcs) homologue on the genome database of p. intermedia atcc25611 and characterized its gene product. methods: the lcs gene homologue cloned into pgex6p-1 vector was expressed in escherichia coli and purified. lcs activity was  assayed by detection of the reaction products (hydrogen sulfide and pyruvate) or  its derivatives from l-cysteine. site-directed mutagenesis was used to convert an amino acid of the lcs molecule. results: the purified lcs gene product catalysed  the degradation of l-cysteine to pyruvate, ammonia, and hydrogen sulfide, indicating that the protein is l-cysteine desulfhydrase. the enzyme required pyridoxal 5'-phosphate as a cofactor, and it was highly active at ph 7.0 and completely inhibited by zncl(2). the k(m) and v(max) of the enzyme were 0.7 mm and 4.2 micromol/min/mg, respectively. replacement of tyr-59, tyr-118, asp-198, and lys-233 with any of the amino acids resulted in the complete disappearance of lcs activity, implying that these amino acids are essential for enzyme activity.  in addition, hydrogen sulfide produced by this enzyme lysed sheep red blood cells and modified hemoglobin. conclusion: these results show the enzymatic properties  of l-cysteine desulfhydrase from p. intermedia atcc25611 and also suggest that the lcs enzyme, which produces hydrogen sulfide from l-cysteine, is closely associated with the pathogenesis of p. intermedia.

AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, previously classified as a strict anaerobe, can grow in the presence of low concentrations of oxygen. microarray analysis revealed alteration in gene expression in the presence of 6 % oxygen. during the exponential growth phase, 96 genes were upregulated and 79 genes were downregulated 1.4-fold. genes encoding proteins that play a role in oxidative stress protection were upregulated, including alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (ahpcf), superoxide dismutase (sod) and thiol peroxidase (tpx). significant changes in gene expression of proteins that mediate oxidative metabolism, such as cytochrome d ubiquinol oxidase-encoding genes, cyda and cydb, were detected. the  expression of genes encoding formate uptake transporter (pg0209) and formate tetrahydrofolate ligase (fhs) was drastically elevated, which indicates that formate metabolism plays a major role under aerobic conditions. the concomitant reduction of expression of a gene encoding the lactate transporter pg1340 suggests decreased utilization of this nutrient. the concentrations of both formate and lactate were assessed in culture supernatants and cells, and they were in agreement with the results obtained at the transcriptional level. also, genes encoding gingipain protease secretion/maturation regulator (porr) and protease transporter (port) had reduced expression in the presence of oxygen, which also correlated with reduced protease activities under aerobic conditions.  in addition, metal transport was affected, and while iron-uptake genes such as the genes encoding the haemin uptake locus (hmu) were downregulated, expression of manganese transporter genes, such as feob2, was elevated in the presence of oxygen. finally, genes encoding putative regulatory proteins such as extracellular function (ecf) sigma factors as well as small proteins had elevated expression levels in the presence of oxygen. as p. gingivalis is distantly related to the well-studied model organism escherichia coli, results from our work may provide further understanding of oxygen metabolism and protection in other related bacteria belonging to the phylum bacteroidetes.

TI  == human gingival fibroblasts release high-mobility group box-1 protein through active and passive pathways.
AB  == introduction: the nuclear protein high-mobility group box-1 (hmgb1) acts as a late mediator of inflammation when secreted in the extracellular milieu. in this  study, we examined the effect of lipopolysaccharides from periodontal pathogens and apoptotic and necrotic cell death on hmgb1 production in human gingival fibroblasts (hgf). methods: hgf from healthy periodontal tissue were cultured and stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (lps) from aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and escherichia coli. we also initiated apoptotic and necrotic cell deaths in hgf. the hmgb1 released in the supernatants from stimulated or dying cells was measured. immunocytochemical staining against hmgb1 was performed in lps-stimulated hgf. results: a significantly higher amount of hmgb1 was detected from necrotic and apoptotic hgf. lps from a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and e. coli significantly  induced the production of hmgb1 in a time-dependent manner. after 6 h of lps stimulation, hmgb1 was present in the cytoplasm of cells whereas its location was mainly nuclear after 24 h. conclusions: lps from two major periodontal pathogens, a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis, induced hmgb1 secretion from hgf. apoptotic and necrotic cell deaths resulted in the enhancement of hmgb1. our results suggest that hgf can be a source of hmgb1 by both active secretion and passive release, and that hmgb1 from hgf may contribute to periodontal tissue destruction.

TI  == human gingival fibroblasts are critical in sustaining inflammation in periodontal disease.
AB  == background and objective: a major factor in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease, which is one of the biofilm infectious diseases, is thought to be lipopolysaccharide (lps), owing to its ability to cause inflammation and promote  tissue destruction. moreover, the elimination of pathogens and their component lpss is essential for the successful treatment of periodontal disease. lipopolysaccharide tolerance is a mechanism that prevents excessive and prolonged responses of monocytes and macrophages to lps. since persistence of inflammation  is necessary for inflammatory cytokine production, cells other than monocytes and macrophages are thought to maintain the production of cytokines in the presence of lps. in this study, we investigated whether human gingival fibroblasts (hgfs), the most abundant structural cell in periodontal tissue, might be able to maintain inflammatory cytokine production in the presence of lps bynot displaying lps tolerance. material and methods: human gingival fibroblasts were pretreated with lps (from porphyromonas gingivalis and escherichia coli) and then treated with lps, and the amounts of interleukin (il)-6 and il-8 in the cell culture supernatants were measured. the expression of negative regulators of lps signalling (suppressor of cytokine signalling-1, interleukin-1 receptor-associated-kinase m and sh2 domain-containing inositol-5-phosphatase-1)  was also examined in lps-treated hgfs. results: human gingival fibroblasts did not display lps tolerance but maintained production of il-6 and il-8 when pretreated with lps, followed by secondary lps treatment. lipopolysaccharide-treated hgfs did not express negative regulators. conclusion:  these results demonstrate that hgfs do not show lps tolerance and suggest that this characteristic of hgfs sustains the inflammatory response in the presence of virulence factors.

TI  == role of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in glutathione catabolism.
AB  == introduction: our previous studies demonstrated that three enzymes, gamma-glutamyltransferase (ggt), cysteinylglycinase (cgase) and cystalysin, are required for the catabolism of glutathione to produce hydrogen sulfide (h(2)s) in treponema denticola. in this study, we examined glutathione catabolism in aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. methods: the ggt and cgase of a. actinomycetemcomitans were determined by biological methods and ggt was characterized using a molecular biological approach. results: a. actinomycetemcomitans showed ggt and cgase activity, but could not produce h(2)s  from glutathione. the addition of recombinant t. denticola cystalysin, an l-cysteine desulfhydrase, to whole cells of a. actinomycetemcomitans resulted in  the production of h(2)s from glutathione. subsequently, we cloned a. actinomycetemcomitans ggt gene (ggt) and overexpressed the 63 kda ggt protein. the recombinant a. actinomycetemcomitans ggt was purified and identified. the k(cat)/k(m) of the recombinant ggt from n-gamma-l-glutamyl-4-nitroaniline as substrate was 31/microm/min. the activity of ggt was optimum at ph 6.9-7.1 and enhanced by thiol-containing compounds. conclusion: the results demonstrated that a. actinomycetemcomitans had ggt and cgase activities and that the ggt was characterized. the possible role of a. actinomycetemcomitans in glutathione metabolism and h(2)s production from oral bacteria was discussed.

TI  == prevalence of capnocytophaga canimorsus in dogs and occurrence of potential virulence factors.
AB  == capnocytophaga canimorsus is a gram-negative commensal of dog's mouth causing severe human infections. a strain isolated from a human fatal infection was recently shown to have a sialidase, to inhibit the bactericidal activity of macrophages and to block the release of nitric oxide by lps-stimulated macrophages. the present study aimed at determining the prevalence of c. canimorsus in dogs and the occurrence of these hypothetical virulence factors. c. canimorsus could be retrieved from the saliva of 61 dogs out of 106 sampled. like in clinical isolates, all dog strains had a sialidase and 60% blocked the killing of phagocytosed escherichia coli by macrophages. in contrast, only 6.5% of dog strains blocked the release of nitric oxide by lps-challenged macrophages, suggesting that this property might contribute to virulence. the comparative analysis of 69 16s rdna sequences revealed the existence of c. canimorsus strains that could be misdiagnosed.

TI  == critical role of apoptotic speck protein containing a caspase recruitment domain  (asc) and nlrp3 in causing necrosis and asc speck formation induced by porphyromonas gingivalis in human cells.
AB  == periodontal disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder that leads to the destruction of tooth-supporting tissue and affects 10-20 million people in the u.s. alone. the oral pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis causes inflammatory host response leading to periodontal and other secondary inflammatory diseases. to identify molecular components that control host response to p. gingivalis in humans, roles for the nlr (nbd-lrr) protein, nlrp3 (cryopyrin, nalp3), and its adaptor apoptotic speck protein containing a c-terminal caspase recruitment domain (asc) were studied. p. gingivalis strain a7436 induces cell death in thp1  monocytic cells and in human primary peripheral blood macrophages. this process is asc and nlrp3 dependent and can be replicated by p. gingivalis lps and escherichia coli. p. gingivalis-induced cell death is caspase and il-1 independent and exhibits morphological features consistent with necrosis including loss of membrane integrity and release of cellular content. intriguingly, p. gingivalis-induced cell death is accompanied by the formation of asc aggregation specks, a process not previously described during microbial infection. asc specks are observed in p. gingivalis-infected primary human mononuclear cells and are dependent on nlrp3. this work shows that p. gingivalis  causes asc- and nlrp3-dependent necrosis, accompanied by asc speck formation.

TI  == human microbiota-secreted factors inhibit shiga toxin synthesis by enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7.
AB  == escherichia coli o157:h7 is a food-borne pathogen causing hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic-uremic syndrome, especially in children. the main virulence factor responsible for the more serious disease is the shiga toxin 2 (stx2), which is released in the gut after oral ingestion of the organism. although it is accepted that the amount of stx2 produced by e. coli o157:h7 in the gut is critical for the development of disease, the eukaryotic or prokaryotic gut factors that modulate stx2 synthesis are largely unknown. in this study, we examined the influence of prokaryotic molecules released by a complex human microbiota on stx2 synthesis by e. coli o157:h7. stx2 synthesis was assessed after growth of e. coli o157:h7 in cecal contents of gnotobiotic rats colonized with human microbiota or  in conditioned medium having supported the growth of complex human microbiota. extracellular prokaryotic molecules produced by the commensal microbiota repress  stx(2) mrna expression and stx2 production by inhibiting the spontaneous and induced lytic cycle mediated by reca. these molecules, with a molecular mass of below 3 kda, are produced in part by bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a predominant  species of the normal human intestinal microbiota. the microbiota-induced stx(2)  repression is independent of the known quorum-sensing pathways described in e. coli o157:h7 involving sdia, qsea, qsec, or autoinducer 3. our findings demonstrate for the first time the regulatory activity of a soluble factor produced by the complex human digestive microbiota on a bacterial virulence factor in a physiologically relevant context.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide induces tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 secretion, and ccl25 gene expression, in mouse primary gingival cell lines: interleukin-6-driven activation of ccl2.
AB  == background and objective: porphyromonas gingivalis infection is strongly associated with periodontitis. although p. gingivalis is known to elicit a strong inflammatory response, details of that remain fragmentary. to understand the local response to p. gingivalis, primary cell lines derived from mouse gingival tissues were exposed to p. gingivalis or escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, and the production of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha was measured. ccl25 gene expression was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. cells  stimulated with combinations of interleukin-6, soluble interleukin-6 receptor and/or soluble gp130 were assayed for ccl2 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha secretion. material and methods: primary cell lines were generated from mouse gingival tissues. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to determine cytokine levels, and real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify ccl25 gene expression. results: exposure to p. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide but  not to e. coli lipopolysaccharide resulted in significantly elevated levels of both interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and stimulation with p. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide also upregulated ccl25 gene expression. in one of three experiments, interleukin-6 induced ccl2 secretion, whereas interleukin-6 plus soluble interleukin-6 receptor induced ccl2 secretion in all three experiments, suggesting that both direct interleukin-6 signaling and interleukin-6 trans-signaling may be involved. however, because soluble gp130 did not inhibit trans-signaling, and because direct stimulation of gingival cells with soluble gp130 resulted in ccl2 secretion, the possibility exists that soluble gp130 forms binary complexes with soluble interleukin-6 receptor that promote direct interleukin-6 stimulation. conclusion: these findings define a pathway in which exposure of gingival cells to p. gingivalis induces the release  of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha; interleukin-6, in turn, induces ccl2 secretion.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis, gamma interferon, and a proapoptotic fibronectin matrix form a synergistic trio that induces c-jun n-terminal kinase 1-mediated nitric oxide generation and cell death.
AB  == during infection and inflammation, bacterial and inflammatory proteases break down extracellular matrices into macromolecular fragments. fibronectin fragments  are associated with disease severity in arthritis and periodontitis. the mechanisms by which these fragments contribute to disease pathogenesis are unclear. one likely mechanism is that fibronectin fragments induce apoptosis of resident cells, which can be further modulated by nitric oxide. nitric oxide levels are increased at inflammatory sites in periodontitis patients. the aim of  this study was to examine whether a proapoptotic fibronectin matrix (afn) exerts  its action by inducing nitric oxide and whether priming by bacterial and inflammatory components exacerbates this mechanism. our data demonstrate that afn increased the levels of nitric oxide and inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) dose and time dependently in periodontal ligament (pdl) cells. these effects and  apoptosis were inhibited by inos suppression and enhanced by inos overexpression. nitric oxide and inos induction were paralleled by increased c-jun n-terminal kinase 1 (jnk-1) phosphorylation. jnk-1 overexpression enhanced the expression of nitric oxide and inos, whereas inhibiting jnk-1 by small interfering rna or a kinase mutant reversed these findings. priming pdl cells with porphyromonas gingivalis, its lipopolysaccharide (lps), or gamma interferon (ifn-gamma) further increased nitric oxide levels and apoptosis. escherichia coli and streptococcus mutans induced lesser effects. gingival fibroblasts and neutrophils responded to  a lesser degree to these stimuli, whereas keratinocytes were resistant to apoptosis. thus, proapoptotic matrices trigger nitric oxide release via jnk-1, promoting further apoptosis in host cells. lps and ifn-gamma accentuate this mechanism, suggesting that during inflammation, the affected matrices and bacterial and inflammatory components combined exert a greater pathogenic effect  on host cells.

TI  == the role of the rgpa-kgp proteinase-adhesin complexes in the adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis to fibroblasts.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis strains w50 and atcc 33277 were shown to bind to cultured human fibroblast (mrc-5) cells using flow cytometry. as the concentration of p. gingivalis strain w50 cells was increased relative to the concentration of mrc-5 cells, the number of w50 cells bound per mrc-5 cell increased, as did the percentage of mrc-5 cells with bacteria bound. however, this relationship was only seen for p. gingivalis strain atcc 33277 at low cell concentrations: at high bacterial cell concentrations strain atcc 33277 auto-aggregated and binding to the mrc-5 cells decreased. strain w50 was therefore chosen to study the role of the surface proteinase-adhesin complexes (rgpa-kgp complexes) in binding to mrc-5 cells. p. gingivalis w50 cells treated with an inhibitor of the rgpa-kgp complexes exhibited reduced binding to mrc-5 cells. the purified active and proteinase-inactive rgpa-kgp complexes competitively inhibited binding of w50 to mrc-5 cells, and isogenic mutants of w50 lacking rgpa/b and kgp displayed reduced binding. p. gingivalis w50 mutant cells lacking kgp exhibited the lowest binding to mrc-5 cells, suggesting an important role for this proteinase and its associated adhesins in binding to fibroblasts.

TI  == immunogenicity of a cholera toxin b subunit porphyromonas gingivalis fimbrial antigen fusion protein expressed in e. coli.
AB  == the gram-negative anaerobic oral bacterium porphyromonas gingivalis initiates periodontal disease through fimbrial attachment to saliva-coated oral surfaces. to study the effects of immunomodulation on enhancement of subunit vaccination, the expression in e. coli and immunogenicity of p. gingivalis fimbrial protein (fima) linked to the c-terminus of the cholera toxin b subunit (ctb) were investigated. complementary dnas encoding the p. gingivalis 381 fimbrillin protein sequence fima1 (amino acid residues 1-200) and fima2 (amino acid residues 201-337) were cloned into an e. coli expression vector downstream of a cdna fragment encoding the immunostimulatory ctb. ctb-fima1 and ctb-fima2 fusion proteins synthesized in e. coli bl21 (de3) cells were purified under denaturing conditions by ni2+-nta affinity column chromatography. renaturation of the ctb-fima1 and ctb-fima2 fusion proteins, permitted identification of ctb-fima pentamers and restored ctb binding activity to gm1-ganglioside to provide a biologically active ctb-fima fusion protein. mice orally inoculated with purified ctb-fima1 or ctb-fima2 fusion proteins generated measurable fima1 and fima2 igg antibody titers, while no serum fimbrial igg antibodies were detected when mice were inoculated with fima1 or fima2 proteins alone. immunoblot analysis confirmed that sera from mice immunized with ctb linked to fima1 or fima2 contained antibodies specific for p. gingivalis fimbrial proteins. in addition, mice immunized with fima2 or ctb-fima2 generated measurable intestinal iga titers indicating the presence of fimbrial antibody class switching. further, mice orally immunized with ctb-fima1 generated higher iga antibody titers than mice inoculated with fima1 alone. the experimental data show that the immunostimulatory molecule ctb enhances b cell-mediated immunity against linked p. gingivalis fima fusion proteins, in comparison to immunization with fima protein alone. thus, linkage of ctb to p. gingivalis fimbrial antigens can increase subunit vaccine immunogenicity to provide enhanced protection against periodontal disease.

TI  == genetic tools for studying capnocytophaga canimorsus.
AB  == capnocytophaga canimorsus, a commensal bacterium from canine oral flora, has been isolated throughout the world from severe human infections caused by dog bites. due to the low level of evolutionary relationship to proteobacteria, genetic methods suitable for the genus capnocytophaga needed to be established. here, we  show that tn4351, derived from bacteroides fragilis, could be introduced by conjugation into c. canimorsus and conferred resistance to erythromycin. by mapping and sequencing a naturally occurring plasmid isolated from a clinical isolate of c. canimorsus, we identified a repa gene that allowed us to construct  escherichia coli-capnocytophaga shuttle vectors. most commonly used antibiotic markers were not functional in c. canimorsus, but cefoxitin (cfxa), tetracycline  (tetq), and erythromycin (ermf) resistances could be used as markers for plasmid  maintenance in c. canimorsus and even in some other capnocytophaga spp. shuttle vectors were introduced into c. canimorsus either by conjugation using the origin of transfer (orit) of rp4 or by electrotransformation. taking advantage of the promoter of ermf, an expression vector was constructed. finally, a method that allows site-directed mutagenesis is described. all these genetic tools pave the way, not only for molecular studies of the pathogenesis of c. canimorsus, but also for studies of other oral capnocytophaga species.

TI  == functional analysis of the thioredoxin domain in porphyromonas gingivalis hbp35.
AB  == periodontitis is one of the most common oral diseases in humans. this caused by infection by the oral bacterium porphyromonas gingivalis. our strategy to prevent this infection is to establish a passive immunization system in which endogenous  antibodies can be applied directly to neutralize virulent factors associated with this bacterium. we focused our attention on the p. gingivalis 35 kda surface protein, or hbp35, since this protein is involved not only in the coaggregation with oral miroflora but also in hemin binding. in addition, nucleotide sequencing of the gene, hbp35, coding for this protein revealed the presence of a catalytic  center for thioredoxin, and we further attempted to characterized the protein by  amino acid substitution. a total of four cys residues were substituted for ser residues by combining the simple method for site-directed mutagenesis and the heterodimer system, an approach designed to construct chimeric plasmids readily.  native and mutagenized hbp35 were introduced into the eschericha coli dsba mutant strain, jcb 572, defective in both alkaline phosphatase and motile activities due to inefficient disulfide bond formation. transformant harboring the native hbp35  could complement the dsba mutation, suggesting a role of disulfide bond formation of this protein in p. gingivalis cells. possible roles of the cys residues in complementation are discussed.

TI  == p. gingivalis and e. coli lipopolysaccharides exhibit different systemic but similar local induction of inflammatory markers.
AB  == background: porphyromonas gingivalis is a gram-negative bacterium that is an important etiologic agent of human adult periodontitis. the goal of the study was to test the hypothesis that two isoforms of p. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (pglps), pglps(1435)(/1449) and pglps(1690), exhibit differences in their capacity to stimulate systemic versus local responses compared to escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (lps). methods: lps was inoculated into the scalp of mice, and the response was measured locally at the site of inoculation and systemically in the heart/aorta. vascular cell adhesion molecule (vcam)-1 was assessed at the protein level by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and vcam-1, e-selectin, and intercellular adhesion molecule (icam)-1 were assessed at the rna level of the rnase protection assay. serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) levels were also measured. results: e. coli lps and both isoforms of  p. gingivalis lps were relatively potent in stimulating the expression of inflammatory markers, with e. coli lps being more potent. in contrast, when the systemic response was measured in the heart/aorta, e. coli lps, but not p. gingivalis lps, significantly induced inflammatory markers. at moderate to low doses (1 and 10 microg per injection), serum tnf-alpha levels were minimally induced by p. gingivalis lps compared to e. coli lps. conclusions: both forms of  p. gingivalis lps stimulated an inflammatory response when injected into connective tissue but were minimally stimulatory when a systemic response was measured. in contrast, e. coli lps was a potent stimulus at the systemic and local levels.

AB  == background and objective: the purpose of this study was to determine any difference between porphyromonas gingivalis isolates from periodontally healthy sites as compared to those from diseased sites with respect to the ability to invade host cells. material and methods: subgingival plaque samples were obtained from periodontally healthy and diseased sites using paper points. p. gingivalis colonies were isolated and tested, using an antibiotic protection assay, for their ability to invade kb cells. p. gingivalis 381 and escherichia coli mc1061 were used as controls. results: mean values of 16.79 +/- 0.86 x 10(3) colony-forming units/ml and 26.14 +/- 2.11 x 10(3) colony-forming units/ml were observed in invasion assays for isolates from periodontally healthy and diseased  sites, respectively. p. gingivalis present in diseased sites had significantly greater invasive abilities than strains isolated from healthy sites. no statistical difference was noted between male or female subjects concerning the degree of invasion; isolates from diseased sites from both genders had significantly greater invasion abilities than those from healthy sites. a significant correlation was found between the increased invasive capabilities of  p. gingivalis isolates vs. an increased probing depth. conclusion: the increased  invasion noted with p. gingivalis isolates from diseased sites vs. healthy sites, and the increased invasive capabilities with increasing probing depth, indicate that p. gingivalis isolates have a varying ability to invade host cells in the periodontal pocket.

TI  == acyl chain specificity of the acyltransferases lpxa and lpxd and substrate availability contribute to lipid a fatty acid heterogeneity in porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis lipid a is heterogeneous with regard to the number, type, and placement of fatty acids. analysis of lipid a by matrix-assisted laser  desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry reveals clusters of peaks  differing by 14 mass units indicative of an altered distribution of the fatty acids generating different lipid a structures. to examine whether the transfer of hydroxy fatty acids with different chain lengths could account for the clustering of lipid a structures, p. gingivalis lpxa (lpxa(pg)) and lpxd(pg) were cloned and expressed in escherichia coli strains in which the homologous gene was mutated. lipid a from strains expressing either of the p. gingivalis transferases was found to contain 16-carbon hydroxy fatty acids in addition to the normal e. coli  14-carbon hydroxy fatty acids, demonstrating that these acyltransferases display  a relaxed acyl chain length specificity. both lpxa and lpxd, from either e. coli  or p. gingivalis, were also able to incorporate odd-chain fatty acids into lipid  a when grown in the presence of 1% propionic acid. this indicates that e. coli lipid a acyltransferases do not have an absolute specificity for 14-carbon hydroxy fatty acids but can transfer fatty acids differing by one carbon unit if  the fatty acid substrates are available. we conclude that the relaxed specificity of the p. gingivalis lipid a acyltransferases and the substrate availability account for the lipid a structural clusters that differ by 14 mass units observed in p. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide preparations.

AB  == matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) play pivotal roles in inflammatory diseases including chronic periodontitis. the effects of prevotella intermedia, a major periodontal pathogen, on mmp-9 production in primary human periodontal ligament (hpdl) cells were examined in the present study. mmp-9 mrna expression was measured by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase pcr and its protein secretion  was assayed by gelatin zymography. prevotella intermedia atcc 25611 supernatant time and dose-dependently induced mmp-9 expression. in contrast, porphyromanas gingivalis atcc 33277 supernatants, escherichia coli lipopolysacchride and il-1beta exhibited no stimulatory effects on mmp-9 production in hpdl cells. mitogen-activated protein kinases [mapk, including extracellular signal-related kinases (erk), c-jun n-terminal kinases (jnk) and p38] inhibitors exerted no effect on the p. intermedia-induced mmp-9 production, indicating that p. intermedia induced mmp-9 production through an mapk-independent pathway. our results demonstrated that p. intermedia may contribute to periodontal tissue destruction during chronic periodontitis by inducing mmp-9 production in hpdl cells.

TI  == biological properties of the native and synthetic lipid a of porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide.
AB  == introduction and methods: a pentaacyl and diphosphoryl lipid a molecule found in  the lipid a isolated from porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (lps) was chemically synthesized, and its characteristics were evaluated to reconfirm its interesting bioactivities including low endotoxicity and activity against lps-unresponsive c3h/hej mouse cells. results: the synthesized p. gingivalis lipid a (synthetic pg-la) exhibited strong activities almost equivalent to those  of escherichia coli-type synthetic lipid a (compound 506) in all assays on lps-responsive mice, and cells. lps and native lipid a of p. gingivalis displayed overall endotoxic activities, but its potency was reduced in comparison to the synthetic analogs. in the assays using c3h/hej mouse cells, the lps and native lipid a significantly stimulated splenocytes to cause mitosis, and peritoneal macrophages to induce tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 production. however, synthetic pg-la and compound 506 showed no activity on the lps-unresponsive cells. inhibition assays using some inhibitors including anti-human toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2) and tlr4/md-2 complex monoclonal antibodies showed that the biological activity of synthetic pg-la was mediated only through the tlr4 signaling pathway, which might act as a receptor for lps, whereas tlr2, possibly together with cd14, was associated with the signaling cascade for lps and native lipid a of p. gingivalis, in addition to the tlr4 pathway. conclusion: these results suggested that the moderated and reduced biological activity of p. gingivalis lps and native lipid a, including their activity on c3h/hej mouse cells via the tlr2-mediated pathway, may be mediated by bioactive contaminants or low acylated molecules present in the native preparations having multiple lipid a moieties.

TI  == early and preferential induction of il-1 receptor-associated kinase-m in thp-1 cells by lps derived from porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == lps of porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis) is suggested to be a virulence factor in periodontitis, stimulating host cells to produce proinflammatory mediators. however, p. gingivalis lps has been reported to show lower biological  activity compared with escherichia coli (e. coli) lps. although differences in the chemical structure of lipid a and the receptor conferring lps signaling are thought to account for these characteristics, the precise reason is unknown. here, we demonstrate that p. gingivalis lps up-regulates il-1r-associated kinase  (irak)-m, a negative regulator of the tlr signaling pathway, in a thp-1-derived macrophage more robustly than e. coli lps. although down-regulation of irak-m by  small interfering (si)rna augmented transcription and translation of tnf-, il-6,  and il-12 p40 in lps-stimulated macrophages, the effect of sirna was more prominent in p. gingivalis lps-stimulated cells. degradation of irak-1 was more obvious in e. coli lps-stimulated macrophages than the cells stimulated with p. gingivalis lps, suggesting that p. gingivalis lps-induced irak-m suppressed dissociation of irak-1 from the receptor complex, resulting in escape from subsequent degradation. this activity may be involved in the chronic infection of this bacterium in periodontal tissue by serving as an escape mechanism from immune surveillance.

TI  == further evidence that major outer membrane proteins homologous to ompa in porphyromonas gingivalis stabilize bacterial cells.
AB  == introduction: porphyromonas gingivalis is one of the most important bacteria in the progression of chronic periodontal disease. we hypothesized that the major outer membrane proteins pgm6/7, which are homologous to the ompa protein in escherichia coli, might contribute to the stabilization of the cell surface. in this study, the effects of pgm6/7 on the cell surface were examined morphologically. methods: deletion mutants of pgm6/7 (delta694, delta695 and delta695-694) were constructed using the polymerase chain reaction-based overlap  extension method. wild-type atcc 33277 and pgm6/7 mutants were grown under anaerobic conditions. whole cells and thin sections of fixed cells were stained and examined by transmission electron microscopy. results: compared with the wild-type, numerous vesicles released from cells were observed in each deletion mutant. the outer membrane appeared wavy and irregular. increased numbers of vesicles were confirmed after their preparation from the culture supernatant. total gingipain activity in vesicles was increased five- to 10-fold in the deletion mutants. conclusion: this report provides further evidence that pgm6/7 proteins in p. gingivalis play an important role in the maintenance of bacterial  outer membrane integrity.

TI  == stimulatory response of neutrophils from periodontitis patients with periodontal  pathogens.
AB  == objective: neutrophils play a crucial role in the defense of invading bacteria by releasing biologically active molecules. the response of peripheral blood neutrophils was studied in periodontitis-affected patients and in healthy controls towards stimulation to porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) and actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans (aa) extracts. materials and methods: peripheral venous blood was drawn from 23 adult patients with moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis (probing depth >or=5 mm, attachment loss >or=3 mm), and 30 healthy  volunteers. neutrophil response followed by metalloproteinase-9 (mmp-9) and interleukin-8 (il-8) secretion was assayed by zymography and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively, on both whole blood and purified neutrophils.  in addition to periodontal pathogen extracts, known stimulating agents were tested, such as escherichia coli-lipopolysaccharide (lps), phytohemagglutinin, and zymosan a. results: neutrophil response, expressed as a secretion ratio under stimulated and non-stimulated conditions, measured in whole blood, showed no differences between periodontitis and healthy controls. instead, in purified neutrophils from patients, mmp-9 exhibited a significantly higher secretion ratio with lps and pg (1.5- to 2-fold), whereas il-8 showed a larger increase in secretion ratio (3- to 7-fold) in the presence of pg, aa, lps, and zymosan a. conclusion: peripheral neutrophils of periodontitis-affected patients are more reactive as suggested by their significantly higher response toward periodontal pathogen extracts and other stimulating agents.

TI  == conjugal transfer of chromosomal dna contributes to genetic variation in the oral pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is a major oral pathogen that contributes to the development of periodontal disease. there is a significant degree of genetic variation among strains of p. gingivalis, and the population structure has been predicted to be panmictic, indicating that horizontal dna transfer and recombination between strains are likely. the molecular events underlying this genetic exchange are not understood, although a putative type iv secretion system is present in the genome sequence of strain w83, implying that dna conjugation may be responsible for genetic transfer in these bacteria. in this study, we provide in vitro evidence for the horizontal transfer of dna using plasmid- and chromosome-based assays. in the plasmid assays, bacteroides-derived shuttle vectors were tested for transfer from p. gingivalis strains into escherichia coli. of the eight strains tested, five were able to transfer dna into e. coli by a mechanism most consistent with conjugation. additionally, strains w83 and 33277 tested positive for the transfer of chromosomally integrated antibiotic resistance markers. ten chimeras resulting from the chromosomal transfer assay were further analyzed by southern hybridization and were shown to have exchanged  dna fragments of between 1.1 and 5.6 kb, but the overall strain identity remained intact. chimeras showed phenotypic changes in the ability to accrete into biofilms, implying that dna transfer events are sufficient to generate measurable changes in complex behaviors. this ability to transfer chromosomal dna between strains may be an adaptation mechanism in the complex environment of the host oral cavity.

TI  == periodontal bacterial dna suppresses the immune response to mutans streptococcal  glucosyltransferase.
AB  == certain cpg motifs found in bacterial dna enhance immune responses through toll-like receptor 9 (tlr-9) and may also demonstrate adjuvant properties. our objective was to determine if dna from bacteria associated with periodontal disease could affect the immune response to other bacterial antigens in the oral  cavity. streptococcus sobrinus glucosyltransferase (gtf), an enzyme involved in dental caries pathogenesis, was used as a test antigen. rowett rats were injected with aluminum hydroxide (alum) with buffer, alum-gtf, or alum-gtf together with either escherichia coli dna, fusobacterium nucleatum dna, or porphyromonas gingivalis dna. contrary to expectation, animals receiving alum-gtf plus bacterial dna (p. gingivalis in particular) demonstrated significantly reduced serum immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody, salivary iga antibody, and t-cell proliferation to gtf compared to animals immunized with alum-gtf alone. a diminished antibody response was also observed after administration of alum-gtf with the p. gingivalis dna either together or separately, indicating that physical complexing of antigen and dna was not responsible for the reduction in antibody. since tlr triggering by dna induces synthesis of prospective suppressive factors (e.g., suppressor of cytokine signaling [socs]), the effects  of p. gingivalis dna and gtf exposure on rat splenocyte production of socs family molecules and inflammatory cytokines were investigated in vitro. p. gingivalis dna significantly up-regulated socs1 and socs5 expression and down-regulated interleukin-10 expression by cultured splenocytes. these results suggested that dna from periodontal disease-associated bacteria did not enhance, but in fact suppressed, the immune response to a protein antigen from cariogenic streptococci, potentially through suppressive socs components triggered by innate mechanisms.

AB  == an increasing body of evidence suggests that probiotic bacteria are effective in  the treatment of enteric infections, although the molecular basis of this activity remains elusive. to identify putative probiotics, we tested commensal bacteria in terms of their toxicity, invasiveness, inhibition of yersinia-induced inflammation in vitro and in vivo, and modulation of dextran sodium sulfate (dss)-induced colitis in mice. the commensal bacteria escherichia coli, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides distasonis, and streptococcus salivarius were screened for adhesion to, invasion of, and toxicity for host epithelial cells (ec), and the strains were tested for their ability to  inhibit y. enterocolitica-induced nf-kappab activation. additionally, b. adolescentis was administered to mice orally infected with y. enterocolitica and  to mice with mucosae impaired by dss treatment. none of the commensal bacteria tested was toxic for or invaded the ec. b. adolescentis, b. distasonis, b. vulgatus, and s. salivarius inhibited the y. enterocolitica-induced nf-kappab activation and interleukin-8 production in ec. in line with these findings, b. adolescentis-fed mice had significantly lower results for mean pathogen burden in the visceral organs, intestinal tumor necrosis factor alpha mrna expression, and  loss of body weight upon oral infection with y. enterocolitica. in addition, the  administration of b. adolescentis decelerated inflammation upon dss treatment in  mice. we suggest that our approach might help to identify new probiotics to be used for the treatment of inflammatory and infectious gastrointestinal disorders.

TI  == toll-like receptor 4-dependent recognition of structurally different forms of chemically synthesized lipid as of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is a gram-negative anaerobic oral black-pigmented bacterium closely associated with chronic periodontitis. lipopolysaccharide (lps) derived from p. gingivalis is shown to be unusual because the lps contains a greater number of lipid a species, such as tri-, tetra-, and/or penta-acylated lipid as. in this study, a lipid a possessing penta-fatty acyl chains derived from p. gingivalis strain 381 (compound pg-381-5fa) was synthesized, and examined for its immunobiological activities, compared with a tri-acylated lipid a (compound pg-381-3fa) synthesized previously. compound pg-381-5fa, similar to compound pg-381-3fa, demonstrated weaker activity in a limulus test as compared with escherichia coli-type synthetic lipid a (compound 506). compound pg-381-5fa, followed by compound pg-381-3fa, induced kc, interleukin-6, and tumour necrosis factor-alpha production in peritoneal macrophages from lps-responsive c3h/hen mice, but not in those from lps-hyporesponsive c3h/hej mice. furthermore, compound pg-381-5fa, as well as compound pg-381-3fa, activated nuclear factor-kappab via toll-like receptor (tlr)4/md-2, but not tlr2, in a manner similar to compound 506, and worked as an antagonist for compound 506-induced cell activation. in the case of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, compound pg-381-5fa showed much stronger il-6-inducing activity than compound pg-381-3fa. the present results demonstrate that the chemical synthesis of a penta-acylated lipid a, mimicking the natural lipid a portion of lps from p. gingivalis, is attributable to immune cell activation through tlr4, similar to that of compound 506.

AB  == objective: to observe the effects of porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), escherichia coli (ec) lipopolysaccharides (lps) on the production of il-11 and il-6 from healthy human  gingival fibroblasts (hgf), and the effects of endogenous prostaglandin on hgf il-11 and il-6 production stimulated with the above lps. methods: hgf were stimulated with pg-, aa-, ec-lps of different concentrations (0.1, 1, 10 mg/l) for 24 h. and hgf were also stimulated with the combinations of 10 mg/l pg-, aa-, ec-lps and 10(-6) mol/l indomethacin respectively for 24 h. levels of il-11 and il-6 in the supernatants were quantitated by elisa. results: lps from aa, ec, at  the concentration of 10 mg/l and from pg at the concentrations 1, 10 mg/l significantly augmented il-11 production by hgf. il-6 production was also significantly increased by stimulation with aa-lps at concentrations 1, 10 mg/l and with ec-, pg-lps at concentrations 0.1, 1, 10 mg/l. in addition, il-11 production was lower than il-6 production by hgf stimulated with lps. indomethacin significantly inhibited il-6 and il-11 production in lps-stimulated  hgf. conclusions: aa-, pg-, ec-lps may significantly increase il-11 and il-6 level in the supernatants of hgf, and endogenous prostaglandin may upregulate il-11 and il-6 production in lps-stimulated hgf.

TI  == interaction of adrenomedullin and calcitonin gene-related peptide with the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == the nature of the interaction between porphyromonas gingivalis and the multifunctional peptides adrenomedullin and calcitonin gene-related peptide (cgrp) was investigated. growth of p. gingivalis was not inhibited in the presence of either of these peptides [minimal inhibitory concentration (mic)>250  microg ml(-1)]. the ability of the arginine- and lysine-specific proteases from p. gingivalis to breakdown these peptides was investigated. adrenomedullin and cgrp were incubated with culture supernatants from wild-type and protease gene knockout strains. no significant effect on antimicrobial activity against the indicator organism escherichia coli bue55 was found (mic=6.25 microg ml(-1) in all cases). the role of anionic components on the surface of p. gingivalis, which may alter binding of these cationic peptides, was also investigated in relation to adrenomedullin. growth of gene knockout strains lacking surface polysaccharide and capsule components was not inhibited (mic>250 microg ml(-1)). it is suggested that a lack of sensitivity to adrenomedullin and cgrp may enable p. gingivalis to persist in the oral cavity and cause disease.

TI  == il-8 and ido expression by human gingival fibroblasts via tlrs.
AB  == human gingival fibroblasts (hgfs), a predominant cell type in tooth-supporting structure, are presently recognized for their active role in the innate immune response. they produce a variety of inflammatory cytokines in response to microbial components such as lps from the key periodontal pathogen, porphyromonas gingivalis. in this study, we demonstrated that hgfs expressed mrna of tlrs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9, but not tlrs 7, 8, and 10. stimulation of hgfs with highly purified tlr2 ligand (p. gingivalis lps), tlr3 ligand (poly(i:c)), tlr4 ligand (escherichia coli lps), and tlr5 ligand (salmonella typhimurium flagellin) led to expression of il-8 and ido. a potent tlr 9 ligand, cpg oligodeoxynucleotide 2006  had no effect, although hgfs showed a detectable tlr9 mrna expression. no significant enhancement on il-8 or ido expression was observed when hgfs were stimulated with various combinations of tlr ligands. surprisingly, the tlr9 ligand cpg oligodeoxynucleotide 2006 was able to specifically inhibit poly(i:c)-induced il-8 and ido expression. tnf-alpha enhanced tlr ligand-induced  il-8 production in hgfs, whereas ifn-gamma enhanced tlr ligand-induced ido expression. hgf production of ido in response to p. gingivalis lps, ifn-gamma, or the two in combination inhibited t cell proliferation in mlrs. the observed t cell inhibition could be reversed by addition of either 1-methyl-dl-tryptophan or l-tryptophan. our results suggest an important role of hgfs not only in orchestrating the innate immune response, but also in dampening potentially harmful hyperactive inflammation in periodontal tissue.

AB  == the ability of lipid a structural variants to elicit unique endothelial cell gene expression was examined by measuring global gene expression profiles in human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (huvec) using affymetrix full genome chips. two lipid a structural variants obtained from porphyromonas gingivalis designated pglps(1435/1449) and pglps(1690) as well as lps obtained from escherichia coli wild type and an e. coli msbb mutant (missing myristic acid in the lipid a) were  examined. each of these lipid a structures has been shown to interact with tlr4;  however, pglps(1435/1449) and e. coli msbb lps have been shown to be tlr4 antagonists while pglps(1690) and wild-type e. coli lps are tlr4 agonists. it was found that pglps(1435/1449) and pglps(1690) as well as e. coli msbb lps activated a subset of those genes significantly transcribed in response to e. coli wild-type lps. furthermore, the subset of genes expressed in response to the different lipid a structural forms were those most significantly activated by wild-type e. coli lps demonstrating a hierarchy in tlr4-dependent endothelial cell gene activation. a unique gene expression profile for the weak tlr4 agonist  pglps(1690) was observed and represents a tlr4 hierarchy in endothelial cell gene activation.

AB  == oral infection of susceptible mice with toxoplasma gondii results in th1-type immunopathology in the ileum. we investigated gut flora changes during ileitis and determined contributions of gut bacteria to intestinal inflammation. analysis of the intestinal microflora revealed that ileitis was accompanied by increasing  bacterial load, decreasing species diversity, and bacterial translocation. gram-negative bacteria identified as escherichia coli and bacteroides/prevotella  spp. accumulated in inflamed ileum at high concentrations. prophylactic or therapeutic administration of ciprofloxacin and/or metronidazole ameliorated ileal immunopathology and reduced intestinal no and ifn-gamma levels. most strikingly, gnotobiotic mice in which cultivable gut bacteria were removed by quintuple antibiotic treatment did not develop ileitis after toxoplasma gondii infection. a reduction in total numbers of lymphocytes was observed in the lamina propria of specific pathogen-free (spf), but not gnotobiotic, mice upon development of ileitis. relative numbers of cd4(+) t cells did not differ in naive vs infected gnotobiotic or spf mice, but infected spf mice showed a significant increase in the frequencies of activated cd4(+) t cells compared with gnotobiotic mice. furthermore, recolonization with total gut flora, e. coli, or bacteroides/prevotella spp., but not lactobacillus johnsonii, induced immunopathology in gnotobiotic mice. animals recolonized with e. coli and/or total gut flora, but not l. johnsonii, showed elevated ileal no and/or ifn-gamma  levels. in conclusion, gram-negative bacteria, i.e., e. coli, aggravate pathogen-induced intestinal th1-type immunopathology. thus, pathogen-induced acute ileitis may prove useful to study bacteria-host interactions in small intestinal inflammation and to test novel therapies based on modulation of gut flora.

TI  == role of oxyr in the oral anaerobe porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is an anaerobic microorganism that inhabits the oral cavity, where oxidative stress represents a constant challenge. a putative transcriptional regulator associated with oxidative stress, an oxyr homologue, is known from the p. gingivalis w83 genome sequence. we used microarrays to characterize the response of p. gingivalis to h2o2 and examine the role of oxyr in the regulation of this response. most organisms in which oxyr has been investigated are facultative anaerobes or aerobes. in contrast to the oxyr-regulated response of these microorganisms to h2o2, the main feature of the  response in p. gingivalis was a concerted up-regulation of insertion sequence elements related to is1 transposases. common oxyr-regulated genes such as dps and ahpfc were not positively regulated in p. gingivalis in response to h2o2. however, their expression was dependent on the presence of a functional oxyr, as  revealed by microarray comparison of an oxyr mutant to the wild type. phenotypic  characterization of the oxyr mutant showed that oxyr plays a role in both the resistance to h2o2 and the aerotolerance of p. gingivalis. escherichia coli and other bacteria with more complex respiratory requirements use oxyr for regulating resistance to h2o2 and use a separate regulator for aerotolerance. in p. gingivalis, the presence of a single protein combining the two functions might be related to the comparatively smaller genome size of this anaerobic microorganism. in conclusion, these results suggest that oxyr does not act as a sensor of h2o2 in p. gingivalis but constitutively activates transcription of oxidative-stress-related genes under anaerobic growth.

TI  == multitiered approach using quantitative pcr to track sources of fecal pollution affecting santa monica bay, california.
AB  == the ubiquity of fecal indicator bacteria such as escherichia coli and enterococcus spp. in urban environments makes tracking of fecal contamination extremely challenging. a multitiered approach was used to assess sources of fecal pollution in ballona creek, an urban watershed that drains to the santa monica bay (smb) near los angeles, calif. a mass-based design at six main-stem sites and four major tributaries over a 6-h period was used (i) to assess the flux of enterococcus spp. and e. coli by using culture-based methods (tier 1); (ii) to assess levels of enterococcus spp. by using quantitative pcr and to detect and/or quantify additional markers of human fecal contamination, including a human-specific bacteroides sp. marker and enterovirus, using quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr (tier 2); and (iii) to assess the specific types of enterovirus genomes found via sequence analysis (tier 3). sources of fecal indicator bacteria were ubiquitous, and concentrations were high, throughout ballona creek, with no  single tributary dominating fecal inputs. the flux of enterococcus spp. and e. coli averaged 10(9) to 10(10) cells h(-1) and was as high at the head of the watershed as at the mouth prior to discharge into the smb. in addition, a signal  for the human-specific bacteroides marker was consistently detected: 86% of the samples taken over the extent during the study period tested positive. enteroviruses were quantifiable in 14 of 36 samples (39%), with the highest concentrations at the site furthest upstream (cochran). these results indicated the power of using multiple approaches to assess and quantify fecal contamination in freshwater conduits to high-use, high-priority recreational swimming areas.

AB  == in escherichia coli the gene htrb codes for an acyltransferase that catalyses the incorporation of laurate into lipopolysaccharide (lps) as a lipid a substituent.  we describe the cloning, expression and characterization of a porphyromonas gingivalis htrb homologue. when the htrb homologue was expressed in wild-type e.  coli or a mutant strain deficient in htrb, a chimeric lps with altered lipid a structure was produced. compared with wild-type e. coli lipid a, the new lipid a  species contained a palmitate (c16) in the position normally occupied by laurate  (c12) suggesting that the cloned gene performs the same function as e. coli htrb  but preferentially transfers the longer-chain palmitic acid that is known to be present in p. gingivalis lps. lps was purified from wild-type e. coli, the e. coli htrb mutant strain and the htrb mutant strain expressing the p. gingivalis acyltransferase. lps from the palmitate bearing chimeric lps as well as the htrb  mutant exhibited a reduced ability to activate human embryonic kidney 293 (hek293) cells transfected with tlr4/md2. lps from the htrb mutant also had a greatly reduced ability to stimulate interleukin-8 (il-8) secretion in both endothelial cells and monocytes. in contrast, the activity of lps from the htrb mutant bacteria expressing the p. gingivalis gene displayed wild-type activity to stimulate il-8 production from endothelial cells but a reduced ability to stimulate il-8 secretion from monocytes. the intermediate activation observed in  monocytes for the chimeric lps was similar to the pattern seen in hek293 cells expressing tlr4/md2 and cd14. thus, the presence of a longer-chain fatty acid on  e. coli lipid a altered the activity of the lps in monocytes but not endothelial  cell assays and the difference in recognition does not appear to be related to differences in toll-like receptor utilization.

AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is a periodontopathogen that may play a role in cardiovascular diseases. hemagglutinins may function as adhesins and are required for virulence of several bacterial pathogens. the aim of this study was to determine the role of hemagglutinin b (hagb) in adherence of p. gingivalis to human coronary artery endothelial (hcae) cells. p. gingivalis strain 381, a p. gingivalis 381 hagb mutant, escherichia coli jm109 expressing hagb (e. coli-hagb), and e. coli jm109 containing puc9 (e. coli-puc9) were tested for their ability to attach to hcae cells. inhibition assays were performed to determine the ability of purified recombinant hagb (rhagb) as well as antibodies  to hagb, including the polyclonal antibody (pab) a7985 and the monoclonal antibody (mab) hl1858, to inhibit the attachment of p. gingivalis to hcae cells.  as expected, when the attachment of p. gingivalis and the hagb mutant were compared, no statistical significance was observed between the two groups (p = 0.331), likely due to the expression of the hagb homolog hagc. however, e. coli-hagb adhered significantly better to hcae cells than did e. coli-puc9, the control strain. in a competition assay, the presence of purified rhagb decreased  bacterial adhesion of p. gingivalis or e. coli-hagb to hcae cells. the presence of pab a7985 or mab hl1858 also significantly decreased attachment of p. gingivalis and e. coli-hagb to host cells. these results indicate that hagb is involved in the adherence of p. gingivalis to human primary endothelial cells.

AB  == we have demonstrated previously that tetra-acylated lps derived from the oral bacterium, porphyromonas gingivalis, and penta-acylated msbb lps derived from a mutant strain of escherichia coli can antagonize the ability of canonical hexa-acylated e. coli lps to signal through the tlr4 signaling complex in human endothelial cells. activation of the tlr4 signaling complex requires the coordinated function of lps binding protein (lbp), cd14, md-2, and tlr4. to elucidate the specific molecular components that mediate antagonism, we developed a recombinant human tlr4 signaling complex that displayed efficient lps-dependent antagonism of e. coli lps in hek293 cells. notably, changes in the expression levels of tlr4 in hek293 cells modulated the efficiency of antagonism by p. gingivalis lps. both soluble (s) cd14 and membrane (m) cd14 supported efficient p. gingivalis lps-dependent and msbb lps-dependent antagonism of e. coli lps in the recombinant tlr4 system. when cells expressing tlr4, md-2, and mcd14 were exposed to lps in the absence of serum-derived lbp, efficient lps-dependent antagonism of e. coli lps was still observed indicating that lps-dependent antagonism occurs downstream of lbp. experiments using immunoprecipitates of scd14 or smd-2 that had been pre-exposed to agonist and antagonist indicated that lps-dependent antagonism occurs partially at scd14 and potently at smd-2. this study provides novel evidence that expression levels of tlr4 can modulate the efficiency of lps-dependent antagonism. however, md-2 represents the principal molecular component that tetra-acylated p. gingivalis lps and penta-acylated msbb lps use to antagonize hexa-acylated e. coli lps at the tlr4 signaling complex.

TI  == differential induction of human beta-defensin expression by periodontal commensals and pathogens in periodontal pocket epithelial cells.
AB  == background: to investigate the possible role of beta-defensins in gingival health and periodontal disease, we examined the effect of several stimuli on the expression of interleukin-8 (il-8), human beta-defensin-1, -2, -3, and -4 (hbd) in primary human diseased gingival epithelial (hge) cell cultures from periodontitis patients by quantitative taqman reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). methods: several strains of the periodontopathogens actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were added to the cells, as well as the oral commensal bacteria fusobacterium nucleatum and escherichia coli. the induction by the proinflammatory stimuli phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (pma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) was also tested. results: in addition to the published observations (pma induces hbd-2 and -4; tnf-alpha induces hbd-2 and -3), it was found that pma can upregulate hbd-1 and hbd-3, whereas tnf-alpha can induce hbd-4. the commensal bacteria were significant inducers of hbd-2, hbd-3, and il-8. the pathogen p. gingivalis induced hbd-1 and hbd-3 at different time points than the commensals,  but no induction of il-8 and hbd-2 could be observed. these data fit with the chemokine paralysis theory. a correlation was found between the pathogenicity of  different serotypes of a. actinomycetemcomitans and the induction profiles of defensins and il-8. conclusion: the results suggest that a correlation can be found in diseased oral epithelium between the defensin profiles that are induced  and the pathogenicity of the oral bacterial strains.

TI  == sixteen homologs of the mex-type multidrug resistance efflux pump in bacteroides  fragilis.
AB  == sixteen homologs of multidrug resistance efflux pump operons of the resistance-nodulation-cell division (rnd) family were found in the bacteroides fragilis genome sequence by homology searches. disruption mutants were made to the mexb homologs of the four genes most similar to pseudomonas aeruginosa mexb.  reverse transcription-pcr was conducted and indicated that the genes were transcribed in a polycistronic fashion and that the promoter was upstream of bmea (the mexa homolog). one of these disruption mutants (in bmeb, the mexb homolog) was more susceptible than the parental strain to certain cephems, polypeptide antibiotics, fusidic acid, novobiocin, and puromycin. the gene for this homolog and the adjacent upstream gene, bmea, were cloned in a hypersensitive escherichia coli host. the resultant transformants carrying b. fragilis bmeab were more resistant to certain agents; these agents also had lower mics for the b. fragilis bmeb disruption mutants than for the parental strain. the putative efflux pump operon is composed of bmea, bmeb, and bmec (a putative outer membrane channel protein homologous with oprm). addition of the efflux pump inhibitors, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (a proton conductor that eliminates the energy source) and phe-arg beta-naphthylamide (mc-207,110) (the first specific inhibitor described for rnd pumps in p. aeruginosa), resulted in lowered mics in the parental strain but not in the bmeb disruption mutant, indicating that the bmeb pump is affected by these inhibitors. this is the first description of rnd type pumps in the genus bacteroides.

TI  == a novel porphyromonas gingivalis feob plays a role in manganese accumulation.
AB  == feob is an atypical transporter that has been shown to exclusively mediate ferrous ion transport in some bacteria. unusually the genome of the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis has two genes (feob1 and feob2) encoding feob homologs, both of which are expressed in bicistronic operons. kinetic analysis of ferrous ion transport by p. gingivalis w50 revealed the presence of a single, high affinity system with a k(t) of 0.31 microm. feob1 was found to be solely responsible for this transport as energized cells of the isogenic feob1 mutant (w50fb1) did not transport radiolabeled iron, while the isogenic feob2 mutant (w50fb2) transported radiolabeled iron at a rate similar to wild type. this was reflected in the iron content of w50fb1 grown in iron excess conditions which was approximately half that of the wild type and w50fb2. the w50fb1 mutant had increased sensitivity to both oxygen and hydrogen peroxide and was avirulent in an animal model of infection whereas w50fb2 exhibited the same virulence as the wild type. analysis of manganous ion uptake using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry revealed a greater than 3-fold decrease in intracellular manganese accumulation in w50fb2 which was also unable to grow in manganese-limited media.  the protein co-expressed with feob2 appears to be a novel feoa-mntr fusion protein that exhibits homology to a manganese-responsive, dna-binding metalloregulatory protein. these results indicate that feob2 is not involved in iron transport but plays a novel role in manganese transport.

TI  == lipopolysaccharide preparation extracted from porphyromonas gingivalis lipoprotein-deficient mutant shows a marked decrease in toll-like receptor 2-mediated signaling.
AB  == we recently demonstrated that a new pg1828-encoded lipoprotein (pg1828lp) was able to be separated from a porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (lps) preparation, and we found that it exhibited strong cell activation, similar to that of escherichia coli lps, through a toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2)-dependent pathway. in order to determine the virulence of pg1828lp toward cell activation,  we generated a pg1828-deficient mutant of p. gingivalis strain 381 by allelic exchange mutagenesis using an ermf-ermam antibiotic resistance cassette. a highly purified preparation of lps from a pg1828-deficient mutant (deltapg1828-lps) showed nearly the same ladder-like patterns in silver-stained gels as a preparation of lps from a wild-type strain (wt-lps), as well as limulus amoebocyte lysate activities that were similar to those of the wt-lps preparation. however, the ability of the deltapg1828-lps preparation to activate  nf-kappab in tlr2-expressing cells was markedly attenuated. cytokine production by human gingival fibroblasts was also decreased in response to the deltapg1828-lps preparation in comparison with the wt-lps preparation, and the activity was comparable to the stimulation of highly purified lipid a of p. gingivalis by tlr4. further, lethal toxicity was rarely observed following intraperitoneal injection of the pg1828-deficient mutant into mice compared to that with the wild-type strain, while the deltapg1828-lps preparation showed no lethal toxicity. taken together, these results clearly indicate that pg1828lp plays an essential role in inflammatory responses and may be a major virulence factor of p. gingivalis.

TI  == a comprehensive study on the immunological reactivity of the hsp90 molecular chaperone.
AB  == periodontitis is a chronic infectious disease, porphyromonas gingivalis being the most implicated pathogen. in the present study, we investigated the role of p. gingivalis htpg (pghtpg), a bacterial ortholog of mammalian hsp90, in the growth  of p. gingivalis and also assessed the immunological cross-reactivity of the members of the hsp90 family. antiserum against rat liver hsp90 potently reacted with yeast hsp90, called hsc82, and also weakly with human hsp90 (hhsp90) and human mitochondrial paralog trap1, but did not react with pghtpg, escherichia coli htpg, or human endoplasmic reticulum paralog grp94. moreover, among 19 monoclonal antibodies raised against hhsp90, nine cross-reacted with yeast hsc82, and one with human grp94, but none bound to pghtpg or e. coli htpg. among them, three mabs that strongly reacted with yeast hsc82 recognized asn(291)-ile(304), a conserved region of the family protein. the polyclonal antibody raised against a  peptide, met(315)-glu(328), of human grp94, which corresponded to the conserved region of hhsp90, cross-reacted with hhsp90, but not with other hsp90-family members. thus, although mammalian hsp90 shares some immunological reactivity with yeast hsc82, human grp94, and human trap1, it is considerably distinct from its bacterial ortholog, htpg. disruption of the p. gingivalis htpg gene neither affected bacterial survival nor altered the sensitivity of p. gingivalis to various forms of stress.

TI  == subcloning of the 200-kda porphyromonas gingivalis antigen gene and inhibition of hemagglutination by an antibody against the recombinant protein.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is a major etiologic agent of periodontitis and exhibits hemagglutinating and adherence activities. we previously succeeded in molecular cloning the 200-kda cell-surface antigenic protein (200-k ap), designated pmd101, that is recognized in sera from periodontitis patients, and identified the 200-k  ap as a hemagglutinin a (haga) derivative. haga is one of the hemagglutinins known to be a useful vaccine against periodontitis. haga has four large, contiguous, direct repeats and the repeat unit is believed to contain the hemagglutinin domain. because production of 200-k ap was low in the escherichia coli host, it was difficult to obtain large amounts of recombinant protein. in this study, we attempt to subclone the gene encoding the useful antigen from pmd101 in an effort to obtain large quantities. a subclone, designated pmd160, encoding a fusion protein of 80-kda haga and maltose-binding protein was successfully constructed, and the novel clone produced relatively large amounts of recombinant protein. dna nucleotide sequences of the pmd160 insert demonstrated that the 80-kda protein contained a short hemagglutinin motif and a  direct repeat unit region. the recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity and rabbit antiserum was raised. the antibody was capable of inhibiting the hemagglutinating activity of p. gingivalis. these findings suggest that novel 80-kda haga derivative proteins can be produced efficiently from e. coli hosts and these may be useful in developing immunotherapy against periodontitis infected by p. gingivalis.

TI  == separation and structural analysis of lipoprotein in a lipopolysaccharide preparation from porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == lipopolysaccharide (lps) preparations from the periodontopathic bacterium porphyromonas gingivalis (pg-lps) are thought to require toll-like receptor (tlr)2 rather than tlr4, a receptor of escherichia coli lps (ec-lps), for activation of immune cells. however, we previously reported that p. gingivalis lipid a, an immunostimulatory principal component of lps, and its synthetic counterpart activate cells through a tlr4-dependent pathway but not via tlr2. in  the present study, a lipoprotein from pg-lps (pg-lp) was shown to be a principal  component for tlr2-mediated cell activation. pg-lp was separated by hydrophobic interaction chromatography followed by preparative electrophoresis and identified by internal peptide sequencing as pg1828, a putative lipoprotein encoded in the p. gingivalis genome. the n-terminal structure was characterized as a triacylated lipopeptide using mass spectrometry. pg-lp, as well as ec-lps, was potent in inducing il-8 production in human gingival fibroblasts. from our results, we propose that pg-lp is a powerful inflammatory factor of p. gingivalis.

TI  == nucleic acid-based diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and improved management using probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common condition in women that represents an imbalance of the vaginal microflora, lactobacilli depletion, and excess growth of mainly anaerobic gram-negative pathogens. diagnosis is made using a series of tests or a gram stain of a vaginal smear. treatment with antibiotics is quite effective, but recurrences are common. a study of 55 vaginal samples from 11 postmenopausal women showed the presence of bv by the gram stain-based nugent scoring system, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that bacteroides or prevotella species were the most common isolates recovered (24 of 25), with escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae also found in some samples. in one case, only gardnerella vaginalis was found. these findings illustrate that bv remains common even among otherwise healthy women, but it is not caused solely by either  gardnerella or mobiluncus. use of a femexam system (cooper surgical, shelton, ct), based upon elevated ph and trimethylamine levels, to screen vaginal smears from 59 healthy women showed poor correlation with the gram stain method. a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of these subjects showed that the lactobacilli-dominant microbiota was restored in subjects with bv but not in controls, following 2 months of daily oral intake of lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14. these studies show that nucleic acid-based methods are effective at identifying bacteria responsible for bv. if such methods could be used to develop a commercially available, self-use kit, women would be much better placed to take control of their own health, for example, using medicinal food or dietary supplement products such as the clinically proven probiotic strains l. rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum rc-14.

TI  == chemotaxis-guided movements in bacteria.
AB  == motile bacteria often use sophisticated chemotaxis signaling systems to direct their movements. in general, bacterial chemotactic signal transduction pathways have three basic elements: (1) signal reception by bacterial chemoreceptors located on the membrane; (2) signal transduction to relay the signals from membrane receptors to the motor; and (3) signal adaptation to desensitize the initial signal input. the chemotaxis proteins involved in these signal transduction pathways have been identified and extensively studied, especially in the enterobacteria escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.  chemotaxis-guided bacterial movements enable bacteria to adapt better to their natural habitats via moving toward favorable conditions and away from hostile surroundings. a variety of oral microbes exhibits motility and chemotaxis, behaviors that may play important roles in bacterial survival and pathogenesis in the oral cavity.

TI  == induction of calprotectin release by porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide  in human neutrophils.
AB  == calprotectin, a major cytosolic protein of leukocytes, is detected in neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and epithelial cells. this protein is known to be a marker for several inflammatory diseases and is detected in inflammatory  gingival tissue with periodontal disease. recently, we found that the calprotectin level in gingival crevicular fluid from periodontitis patients was significantly higher than that of healthy subjects. however, the regulation of calprotectin in periodontal disease is unclear. in the present study, we investigated the effect of lipopolysaccharides of periodontopathic bacteria on calprotectin release from human neutrophils. neutrophils from healthy donors were treated with lipopolysaccharides from porphyromonas gingivalis (p-lps), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and escherichia coli. calprotectin of neutrophil was identified by immunoblotting and calprotectin amount was determined by elisa. two subunits (10  and 14 kda) of calprotectin were observed in the cell and medium fractions from neutrophils. p-lps increased calprotectin release from seven to 16 times the control level after 30 min and its effect appeared in a dose-dependent manner (10-1000 ng/ml). lipopolysaccharides from a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, and e. coli also induced calprotectin release from neutrophils. these results suggest that lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria induce calprotectin release from human neutrophils.

AB  == objectives: detection of subgingival calculus and dentine caries in the bottom of deep periodontal pockets is often difficult without visual observation. we thus examined the possibility of its detection using autofluorescence induced by laser irritation. methods: autofluorescence was measured at various excitation and emission wavelength settings in five specimens each of sound dentine and enamel,  subgingival calculus, and root caries. periodontopathic model teeth with bacterial cells and blood clots were also irritated by laser to obtain autofluorescent images. results: subgingival calculus and dentine caries showed a characteristic 700 nm emission when excited at 635 nm or a 720 nm emission when excited at 655 nm; sound dentine or enamel, however, did not. the calculus differentiation power, however, was higher with excitation at 635 nm than at 655  nm. the autofluorescent images photographed at an excitation of 633 nm provided clear calculus identification in periodontopathic model teeth when a 700 nm band-pass filter or a 700 nm high-pass filter was used. however, fluorescence intensity was masked when the calculus surface was covered by bacterial cells or  blood clots. for clinical use, it would be important to remove subgingival plaque and debris from root surfaces before attempting to detect subgingival calculus and root caries with this manner. conclusion: the autofluorescence method employing excitation of 633-635 nm was found to be a powerful tool for detecting  subgingival calculus and root caries.

TI  == expression of cd73/ecto-5'-nucleotidase on human gingival fibroblasts and contribution to the inhibition of interleukin-1alpha-induced granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor production.
AB  == background and objectives: cd73/5'-nucleotidase (5'-nt) is an ectoenzyme that participates in immune/inflammatory reactions. we examined the possible expression of cd73/5'-nt on human gingival fibroblasts (hgf), which are important to the immune/inflammatory system in periodontal tissue. methods and results: we  demonstrated that cd73/5'-nt was expressed on hgf by flow cytometry. we found that pre-treatment of hgf with 5'-amp induced marked inhibition of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf) production from hgf upon stimulation with interleukin-1alpha (il-1alpha) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). a specific inhibitor of 5'-nt, adenosine 5'-[alpha,beta-methylene] diphosphate blocked the inhibition of gm-csf production, suggesting that adenosine converted from 5'-amp acts on the inhibitory effects. the gm-csf inhibition suggested that a3 receptor might be involved. the rank order of agonists was found to be (n6-benzyl-5'-n-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine) a3 receptor agonist > or = (2-chloroadenosine) non-selective agonist > (cgs-21680) a2a receptor agonist > adenosine > or = (n6-cyclohexyladenosine) a1 agonist. further support for the main role of a3 receptor was the binding a3 antagonist [9-chloro-2-(2-furanyl)-5-([phenylacetyl]amino)[1,2,4]-triazolo[1,5-c]quinazdine] reversed the effect of adenosine, but no significant reverse was observed by a1 (1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine), a2 [3,7-dimethyl-1-(2-propargyl)xanthine],  a2a[8-(3-chlorostyryl)caffeine], and a2b (alloxazine) antagonists. the cd73/5'-nt expression was increased upon stimulation with gamma-interferon, but not other stimulants such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, il-4, lipopolysaccharide from porphyromonas gingivalis and escherichia coli, and fimbriae from p. gingivalis, and this increase was correlated with the enhanced gm-csf inhibition by 5'-amp but not adenosine. conclusions: these findings suggested that cd73/5'-nt on hgf exerts an anti-inflammatory effects in periodontal disease by conversion from 5'-amp to adenosine.

AB  == probiotic microorganisms, especially lactic acid bacteria, are effective in the treatment of infectious diarrhoeal diseases and experimental colitis. although the mechanisms by which these organisms exert their anti-inflammatory effects are largely unknown, immunomodulating effects are suggested. the objective of this study was to examine the effect of a 5-week oral administration of lactobacillus  rhamnosus subspecies gg (lb. gg) on the cellular immune response to intestinal microorganisms in ten healthy volunteers. peripheral blood cells (pb) were stimulated with either 'self' or 'non-self' preparations of faecal samples and isolated bacteroides fragilis group-organisms (bfg) or escherichia coli (esch. coli), and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (il-10, il-4, il-6, ifn-gamma, tnf-alpha) were measured in the culture supernatant. cd4+ t-lymphocyte activation was determined by measurement of intracellular atp following lysis of the cells.  the activational response of cd4+ t-lymphocytes towards isolated and heat-inactivated intestinal organisms was increased after the probiotic treatment. additionally, tnf-alpha, il-6 and in part ifn-gamma cytokine secretion by pb cells following stimulation with whole stool preparations and single members of the flora was significantly decreased, whereas the il-10 and in part il-4 cytokine secretion was increased at the end of the study. in contrast, the activational response of cd4+ t-lymphocytes following stimulation with whole 'non-self' intestinal flora was higher than by 'self' intestinal flora, but both  responses showed a trend towards a reduction at the end of the study. this study  documents a direct effect by lb. gg on the cellular immune system of healthy volunteers and offers a promising tool to investigate systemic immunomodulation due to oral administration of probiotic microorganisms.

AB  == the oral epithelium is continuously exposed to a variety of microbial challenges  that can cause infectious diseases such as periodontal disease. human b defensin-2 (hbd-2) is a cationic antimicrobial peptide with low molecular weight, which is inducible from oral epithelial cells upon either bacterial infection or  stimulation with inflammatory cytokines. this peptide has a broad antimicrobial spectrum that includes gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and fungi. therefore, it is thought that hbd-2 plays an important role as one of natural immunities to bacterial infection. however, its activity is inhibited by body fluids such as serum. the aim of this study was to assess the antibacterial activity of synthetic hbd-2 against oral bacteria in the presence of saliva or serum. the antibacterial activity of synthetic hbd-2 was tested against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans, and escherichia coli. antibacterial broth assay and diffusion assay were  performed in vitro. the antibacterial activity of hbd-2 was approximately equal to that of minocycline at equimolar concentrations. furthermore, the activity of  hbd-2 remained at 60% in the presence of 80% saliva, whereas no activity remained in the presence of 20% serum. our results suggest the possibility that synthetic  hbd-2 could be useful to prevent infection by periodontal bacteria.

TI  == chemical structure and immunobiological activity of lipid a from prevotella intermedia atcc 25611 lipopolysaccharide.
AB  == the novel chemical structure and immunobiological activities of prevotella intermedia atcc 25611 lipid a were investigated. a lipopolysaccharide (lps) preparation of p. intermedia was extracted using a phenol-chloroform-petroleum ether method, after which its purified lipid a was prepared by weak acid hydrolysis followed by chromatographic separations. the lipid a structure was determined by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance to be a diglucosamine backbone with a phosphate at the 4-position of the non-reducing side sugar, as well as five fatty acids containing branched long chains. it was similar to that of bacteroides fragilis and porphyromonas gingivalis, except for  the phosphorylation site. p. intermedia lipid a induced weaker cytokine production and nf-kappab activation in murine cells via toll-like receptor (tlr)  4 as compared to escherichia coli synthetic lipid a (compound 506). our results indicate that p. intermedia lipid a activates cells through a tlr4-dependent pathway similar to e. coli-type lipid a, even though these have structural differences.

TI  == interactions of porphyromonas gingivalis with host cells: implications for cardiovascular diseases.
AB  == background: recent epidemiological studies have suggested a contribution of periodontitis in atherosclerotic diseases. two mechanisms have been proposed to explain such a connection involving general inflammatory responses and/or specific effects of periodontal bacteria on host tissues. methods: the role of the periodontopathogen porphyromonas gingivalis as a potential contributor to atherosclerosis has been investigated in model systems using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvec) and murine j774 macrophage cell cultures. results: p. gingivalis 381 was demonstrated to induce foam cell formation in j774 macrophage  cell cultures in the presence of low-density lipoproteins. the active bacterial component involved in this process appears to be lipopolysaccharide. this effect  was not limited to these organisms as several other gram-positive and gram-negative oral bacteria exhibited the same property. in addition, in a more specific manner, p. gingivalis induced monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 secretion in huvec cultures. conclusions: the fimbriae of strain 381 are important, but are not required, for this inductive effect. taken together, these results suggest a potential role for p. gingivalis in several steps involved in atherosclerotic lesion formation.

TI  == acute bacterial suppurative parotitis: microbiology and management.
AB  == the parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. the most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial parotitis are staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. the predominant anaerobes include gram-negative bacilli (including pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp.), fusobacterium spp., and peptostreptococcus spp. streptococcus spp. (including s.  pneumoniae) and gram-negative bacilli (including escherichia coli) have also been reported. gram-negative organisms are often seen in hospitalized patients. organisms less frequently found are arachnia, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella  pneumoniae, salmonella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, treponema pallidum, cat-scratch bacillus, and eikenella corrodens. mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of parotitis. therapy includes maintenance  of hydration and administration of parenteral antimicrobial therapy. once an abscess has formed surgical drainage is required. the choice of antimicrobial depends on the etiologic agent. maintenance of good oral hygiene, adequate hydration, and early and proper therapy of bacterial infection of the oropharynx  may reduce the occurrence of suppurative parotitis.

TI  == role for recombinant gamma-glutamyltransferase from treponema denticola in glutathione metabolism.
AB  == volatile sulfur compounds, including hydrogen sulfide (h(2)s), have been implicated in the development of periodontal disease. glutathione is an important thiol source for h(2)s production in periodontal pockets. our recent studies have delineated a pathway of glutathione metabolism in treponema denticola that releases h(2)s. in this pathway, gamma-glutamyltransferase (ggt) has been proposed to catalyze the first step of glutathione degradation. we have cloned the gene of ggt from t. denticola, which contains an open reading frame of 726 bp encoding a protein of 241 amino acids. transformation of this gene into escherichia coli led to the expression of a recombinant protein. after purification by chromatography, the recombinant protein showed enzymatic activity typical of ggt, catalyzing the degradation of na-gamma-glutamyl-4-nitroaniline (gna) and the hydrolysis of glutathione, releasing glutamic acid or glutamine and cysteinylglycine. l-cysteine is not a substrate of ggt. importantly, gna, when added to t. denticola, was able to compete with glutathione and inhibit the production of h(2)s, ammonia, and pyruvate. this was accompanied by the suppression of hemoxidative and hemolytic activities of the bacteria. purified ggt was inactivated by tlck (nalpha-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone) and proteinase k treatment. however, higher enzymatic activity was demonstrated in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol. our further experiments showed that the addition of recombinant ggt to porphyromonas gingivalis, a bacterium without significant glutathione-metabolizing capacity, drastically increased the utilization of glutathione by the bacterium, producing h(2)s, ammonia, and pyruvate. this was again accompanied by enhanced bacterial hemoxidative and hemolytic activities. together, the results suggest an important role for ggt in glutathione metabolism in oral bacteria.

TI  == production of macrophage inflammatory protein (mip)-1alpha and mip-1beta by human polymorphonuclear neutrophils stimulated with porphyromonas endodontalis lipopolysaccharide.
AB  == this study was undertaken to investigate the capacity of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmns) to secrete macrophage inflammatory protein (mip)-1alpha and mip-1beta after stimulation with porphyromonas endodontalis lipopolysaccharide (lps). escherichia coli lps was used as a positive control. venous blood was collected and pmns were isolated from healthy volunteers. cells were cultured with various concentrations of lps for different periods of time. cell supernatants were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the levels of chemokine secretion in pmns stimulated with each lps were found to be significantly higher than in the unstimulated control cells (p < 0.05), and this  expression occurred in a time- and dose-dependent manner. e. coli lps induced higher levels of cytokines than p. endodontalis lps. these findings demonstrated  that p. endodontalis lps is capable of stimulating pmns to produce chemotactic cytokines and suggested that pmns stimulated with p. endodontalis lps may play a  crucial role in the inflammatory and immunopathological reactions of pulpal and periapical diseases.

TI  == counteracting interactions between lipopolysaccharide molecules with differential activation of toll-like receptors.
AB  == we investigated counteracting interactions between the lipopolysaccharides (lps)  from escherichia coli (ec-lps) and porphyromonas gingivalis (pg-lps), which induce cellular activation through toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4) and tlr2, respectively. we found that ec-lps induced tolerance in thp-1 cells to subsequent tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin 1 beta (il-1beta) induction by pg-lps, though the reverse was not true, and looked for explanatory  differential effects on the signal transduction pathway. cells exposed to pg-lps, but not to ec-lps, displayed persisting expression of il-1 receptor-associated kinase without apparent degradation, presumably allowing prolonged relay of downstream signals. accordingly, cells pretreated with pg-lps, but not with ec-lps, were effectively activated in response to subsequent exposure to either lps molecule, as evidenced by assessing nuclear factor (nf)-kappab activity. in fact, pg-lps primed thp-1 cells for enhanced nf-kappab activation and tnf-alpha release upon restimulation with the same lps. this was a dose-dependent effect and correlated with upregulation of surface tlr2 expression. furthermore, we observed inhibition of nf-kappab-dependent transcription in a reporter cell line  pretreated with ec-lps and restimulated with pg-lps (compared to cells pretreated with medium only and restimulated with pg-lps), but not when the reverse treatment was made. although pg-lps could not make cells tolerant to subsequent activation by ec-lps, pg-lps inhibited ec-lps-induced tnf-alpha and il-6 release  when the two molecules were added simultaneously into thp-1 cell cultures. pg-lps also suppressed p. gingivalis fima protein-induced nf-kappab-dependent transcription in the 3e10/hutlr4 reporter cell line, which does not express tlr2. this rules out competition for common signaling intermediates, suggesting that pg-lps may block component(s) of the tlr4 receptor complex. interactions between  tlr2 and tlr4 agonists may be important in the regulation of inflammatory reactions.

TI  == induction of keratinocyte growth factor 1 expression by lipopolysaccharide is regulated by cd-14 and toll-like receptors 2 and 4.
AB  == periodontal disease is a chronic inflammatory condition that is associated with increased concentrations of gram-negative pathogenic bacteria and epithelial cell proliferation. regulation of this proliferation is poorly understood but is most  likely controlled by locally expressed growth factors. keratinocyte growth factor 1, an epithelium-specific growth factor, is expressed by gingival fibroblasts, and its expression is regulated in a concentration-dependent manner by lipopolysaccharide. in this study, induction of keratinocyte growth factor 1 protein expression was dependent on gingival fibroblast expression of membrane cd14 (mcd14) and toll-like receptors 2 and 4. lipopolysaccharides from escherichia coli and porphyromonas gingivalis induced membrane expression of cd14 at 1, 3, and 24 h. specifically, lipopolysaccharide induced low mcd14 expression  gingival fibroblasts to express mcd14 at a level consistent with that of high mcd14 expression cells. functional studies with specific blocking antibodies for  cd14 and toll-like receptors 2 and 4 implicated all of these molecules in signal  transduction. the rapid decrease in cell membrane expression of toll-like receptors 2 and 4 after treatment with lipopolysaccharide was consistent with receptor internalization, and blocking of either of these receptors completely inhibited keratinocyte growth factor 1 protein expression. the transcription factors ap-1 and nf-kappab were involved in lipopolysaccharide induction of keratinocyte growth factor 1 mrna and protein expression. these results suggest that lipopolysaccharide may induce proliferation of periodontal epithelial cells  by upregulating keratinocyte growth factor 1 expression via the cd14 and toll-like receptor signaling pathway.

TI  == cloning and expression of a porphyromonas gingivalis gene for protoporphyrinogen  oxidase by complementation of a hemg mutant of escherichia coli.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, a bacterium implicated in periodontal pathogenesis, has a growth requirement for iron protoporphyrin ix. by complementation with a p. gingivalis 381 chromosomal dna library, we were able to isolate a clone that enhanced the poor growth of a hemg mutant of escherichia coli. the dna sequence analysis of this clone revealed three open reading frames (orfs). orf3 encoded a  protein of 466 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 51 695 da. the deduced amino acid sequence of the orf3 gene had significant similarity to sequences of protoporphyrinogen oxidase (ppo) from myxococcus xanthus (30% identical residues). when the orf3 gene was overexpressed in e. coli, the extract had much higher ppo activity than a control extract, and this activity was inhibited by acifluorfen, a specific inhibitor of ppo. thus, orf3 was named pghemg. furthermore, several porphyrin-related genes, including hemd, hemn and hemh, were identified in the data bases on the websites available on-line. we postulated that a porphyrin biosynthetic pathway to heme from preuroporphyrin may be conserved in p. gingivalis.

TI  == a conserved ala320 in the ftsz of porphyromonas gingivalis is important for cell  division.
AB  == we have previously cloned the gene encoding the cell division protein ftsz, designated pgftsz, from porphyromonas gingivalis, an oral anaerobic bacterium implicated in advanced periodontal disease. in the present study, we have shown that overexpression of zdeltac02, a mutant form of pgftsz in which 128 amino acid residues have been removed from the c-terminus, caused an inhibition of cell division in e. coli cells. however, overexpression of zdeltac03, missing 177 residues from the c-terminus, did not inhibit cell division, suggesting that the  49 residues between 281 and 329 are required for cell division. sequence comparison of the known prokaryotic ftszs revealed that this region contained a highly conserved domain, designated a-domain, in which ala320 of pgftsz was conserved throughout a broad variety of species. therefore, we analyzed the role  of ala320 by site-directed mutagenesis. we found that overexpression of za320h and za320r resulted in the normal phenotype, unlike the wild type. immunoblot analysis showed that these mutant proteins were expressed at similar levels. these results suggest that ala320 is highly conserved and is crucial for cell division.

AB  == we report the characterization of a porphyromonas gingivalis gene, designated omp28, encoding a protein that we have previously purified and characterized as a 28-kda outer membrane protein. the deduced amino acid sequence of the omp28 open  reading frame displayed an outer membrane leader sequence and lipoprotein attachment site but did not exhibit any significant overall sequence identity with protein sequences in the databases. a small stretch of amino acids (19 residues) exhibits 50% sequence identity with a segment of a fimbrial protein from dichelobacter nodosus involved in adhesion, suggesting that omp28 may be a surface adhesin/receptor of p. gingivalis. using the pet-24 vector we expressed recombinant omp28 (romp28) in escherichia coli. western blot analyses of purified romp28 with rabbit antisera to a p. gingivalis outer membrane preparation, protective rat anti-whole p. gingivalis antisera and pooled human sera from chronic periodontitis patients showed that the recombinant was recognized by all  antisera. further, anti-romp28 antisera exhibited strong reactivity with a panel  of four laboratory strains and 10 clinical isolates of p. gingivalis from the united states, sudan, romania and norway. these results suggest that omp28 is expressed by a wide distribution of p. gingivalis strains.

TI  == keratinocyte growth factor (kgf)-1 and -2 protein and gene expression in human gingival fibroblasts.
AB  == the onset and progression of periodontal disease is associated with significant changes in the epithelial component of the attachment complex. from the early to  the advanced stages of periodontal disease increased epithelial cell proliferation, migration and invasion into the surrounding connective tissue takes place. concomitantly there is a significant increase in proinflammatory cytokine expression in periodontal tissue and quantitative and qualitative changes in the subgingival microflora, including an increase in gram-negative microorganisms. one of the most significant virulence factors of these bacteria is lipopolysaccharide (lps) connected to the outer membrane. two important growth factors controlling epithelial behavior are keratinocyte growth factor-1 (kgf-1)  and -2 (kgf-2). connective tissue cells express these growth factors, but only epithelial cells respond to them. we studied the effect of proinflammatory cytokines and lps on gingival fibroblast expression of kgf-1 and kgf-2 in vitro.  gingival fibroblasts were found to express kgf-1 and -2 in culture but only kgf-1 protein and gene expression was stimulated by serum, in a concentration-dependent manner by proinflammatory cytokines il-1alpha, il-1beta, tnf-alpha and il-6 and lps isolated from porphyromonas gingivalis and escherichia coli. the local increase in proinflammatory cytokine expression and the accumulation of lps in disease sites may therefore stimulate gingival fibroblast expression of kgf-1. we hypothesize that this local increase in kgf-1 expression may, via a paracrine mechanism, stimulate local epithelial cell proliferation, migration and invasion  during the onset and progression of periodontitis.

AB  == black-pigmented anaerobic bacteria, such as porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia, are amongst the predominant bacteria in periodontal pockets and have been implicated in periodontal diseases. to elucidate the roles  of gingival keratinocytes, which are the first cells encountered by oral bacteria in periodontal diseases, human gingival keratinocytes in primary culture were stimulated with cell-surface components of p gingivalis and pr. intermedia. a glycoprotein fraction from pr. intermedia (pgp) clearly augmented the release of  interleukin-8, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. this pgp also induced expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (icam-1), as determined by flow cytometry. the augmentation of mrna expression for these molecules was also confirmed by reverse transcription pcr. in contrast, lipopolysaccharide (lps) from pr. intermedia and escherichia coli was completely  inactive in these assays. lps fraction and purified fimbriae from p gingivalis exhibited weak activities. cytokine production and icam-1 expression by gingival  keratinocytes might cause accumulation and activation of neutrophils in the epithelium and, therefore, may be involved in the initiation and development of inflammation in periodontal tissues.

AB  == the cell density-dependent control of gene expression is employed by many bacteria for regulating a variety of physiological functions, including the generation of bioluminescence, sporulation, formation of biofilms, and the expression of virulence factors. although periodontal organisms do not appear to  secrete acyl-homoserine lactone signals, several species, e.g., porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum, have recently been shown to secrete a signal related to the autoinducer ii (ai-2) of the signal system 2 pathway in vibrio harveyi. here, we report that the periodontal pathogen actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans expresses a homolog of v. harveyi luxs and secretes an ai-2-like signal. cell-free conditioned medium from a. actinomycetemcomitans or from a recombinant escherichia coli strain (e. coli ais) expressing a. actinomycetemcomitans luxs induced luminescence in v. harveyi bb170 >200-fold over controls. ai-2 levels peaked in mid-exponential-phase cultures of  a. actinomycetemcomitans and were significantly reduced in late-log- and stationary-phase cultures. incubation of early-log-phase a. actinomycetemcomitans cells with conditioned medium from a. actinomycetemcomitans or from e. coli ais resulted in a threefold induction of leukotoxic activity and a concomitant increase in leukotoxin polypeptide. in contrast, no increase in leukotoxin expression occurred when cells were exposed to sterile medium or to conditioned broth from e. coli ais(-), a recombinant strain in which luxs was insertionally inactivated. a. actinomycetemcomitans ai-2 also induced expression of afua, encoding a periplasmic iron transport protein, approximately eightfold, suggesting that luxs-dependent signaling may play a role in the regulation of iron acquisition by a. actinomycetemcomitans. finally, a. actinomycetemcomitans ai-2 added in trans complemented a luxs knockout mutation in p. gingivalis by modulating the expression of the luxs-regulated genes uvrb and hasf in this organism. together, these results suggest that luxs-dependent signaling may modulate aspects of virulence and the uptake of iron by a. actinomycetemcomitans  and induce responses in other periodontal organisms in mixed-species oral biofilm.

AB  == exposure of mononuclear phagocytes to enterobacterial lps induces a state of transient hyporesponsiveness to subsequent lps exposure, termed endotoxin tolerance. in the present study, lps derived from the oral periodontal pathogen,  porphyromonas gingivalis, was compared with that derived from the enterobacterium, escherichia coli, for the ability to induce endotoxin tolerance. pretreatment of the human macrophage cell line, thp-1, with e. coli lps resulted  in a severe reduction in the levels of il-1beta, il-6, and tnf-alpha upon secondary stimulation. in contrast, pretreatment of thp-1 cells with p. gingivalis lps resulted in a mitigation of il-1beta, but not il-6 and tnf-alpha production upon subsequent exposure to p. gingivalis lps: primary or secondary stimulation with < or =100 ng/ml p. gingivalis lps resulted in comparable levels  of il-6 and tnf-alpha, while stimulation of thp-1 cells with > or =1 microg/ml p. gingivalis lps induced a significant enhancement in il-6 and tnf-alpha levels upon secondary exposure. to identify possible mechanisms for these differences, changes in the expression of molecules involved in the lps-signaling pathway were assessed. pretreatment of thp-1 cells with e. coli lps resulted in a significant  reduction in surface toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4) expression and an inability to degrade i-kappab-alpha or i-kappab-beta proteins upon secondary stimulation. in contrast, pretreatment of thp-1 cells with p. gingivalis lps resulted in a significant enhancement of both cd14 and tlr2, while maintaining the ability to degrade i-kappab-beta only upon secondary stimulation. thus, e. coli and p. gingivalis lps differentially affect cd14 and tlr expression as well as secondary lps-associated responses.

TI  == lipopolysaccharides from distinct pathogens induce different classes of immune responses in vivo.
AB  == the adaptive immune system has evolved distinct responses against different pathogens, but the mechanism(s) by which a particular response is initiated is poorly understood. in this study, we investigated the type of ag-specific cd4(+)  th and cd8(+) t cell responses elicited in vivo, in response to soluble ova, coinjected with lps from two different pathogens. we used escherichia coli lps, which signals through toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4) and lps from the oral pathogen  porphyromonas gingivalis, which does not appear to require tlr4 for signaling. coinjections of e. coli lps + ova or p. gingivalis lps + ova induced similar clonal expansions of ova-specific cd4(+) and cd8(+) t cells, but strikingly different cytokine profiles. e. coli lps induced a th1-like response with abundant ifn-gamma, but little or no il-4, il-13, and il-5. in contrast, p. gingivalis lps induced th and t cell responses characterized by significant levels of il-13, il-5, and il-10, but lower levels of ifn-gamma. consistent with  these results, e. coli lps induced il-12(p70) in the cd8alpha(+) dendritic cell (dc) subset, while p. gingivalis lps did not. both lps, however, activated the two dc subsets to up-regulate costimulatory molecules and produce il-6 and tnf-alpha. interestingly, these lps appeared to have differences in their ability to signal through tlr4; proliferation of splenocytes and cytokine secretion by splenocytes or dcs from tlr4-deficient c3h/hej mice were greatly impaired in response to e. coli lps, but not p. gingivalis lps. therefore, lps from different bacteria activate dc subsets to produce different cytokines, and induce distinct  types of adaptive immunity in vivo.

TI  == mature dendritic cells infiltrate the t cell-rich region of oral mucosa in chronic periodontitis: in situ, in vivo, and in vitro studies.
AB  == previous studies have analyzed the lymphoid and myeloid foci within the gingival  mucosa in health and chronic periodontitis (cp); however, the principal apcs responsible for the formation and organizational structure of these foci in cp have not been defined. we show that in human cp tissues, cd1a(+) immature langerhans cells predominantly infiltrate the gingival epithelium, whereas cd83(+) mature dendritic cells (dcs) specifically infiltrate the cd4(+) lymphoid-rich lamina propria. in vivo evidence shows that exacerbation of cp results in increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines that mediate dc activation/maturation, but also of counterregulatory cytokines that may prevent a th-polarized response. consistently, in vitro-generated monocyte-derived dcs pulsed with porphyromonas gingivalis strain 381 or its lps undergo maturation, up-regulate accessory molecules, and release proinflammatory (il-1beta, pge(2)) and th (il-10, il-12) cytokines. interestingly, the il-10:il-12 ratio elicited from p. gingivalis-pulsed dcs was 3-fold higher than that from escherichia coli-pulsed dcs. this may account for the significantly (p < 0.05) lower proliferation of autologous cd4(+) t cells and reduced release of ifn-gamma elicited by p. gingivalis-pulsed dcs. taken together, these findings suggest a previously unreported mechanism for the pathophysiology of cp, involving the activation and in situ maturation of dcs by the oral pathogen p. gingivalis, leading to release of counterregulatory cytokines and the formation of t cell-dc  foci.

TI  == regulation of cytokine production in human gingival fibroblasts following treatment with nicotine and lipopolysaccharide.
AB  == background: patients who smoke are at increased risk for chronic periodontitis (cp). most studies suggest that the microbial flora in these patients is similar  to that found in non-smoking cp patients. thus, the increased risk for development of cp is not dependent on an altered microbial profile, but rather to some change in the host response to these periopathogens. there is evidence that  human gingival fibroblasts (hgf) derived from diseased sites produce greater amounts of interleukin (il)-6 and il-8 in vitro than cells derived from healthy sites. this suggests that hgf subpopulations may be selected based upon the inflammatory milieu in which they reside. the hypothesis to be tested was that the combination of nicotine and lipopolysaccharide (lps) could regulate hgf inflammatory mediator production. methods: hgf cell cultures were established from explants derived from 10 patients with cp. hgf cell cultures were stimulated with 1 mm, 1 microm, or 1 nm nicotine +/- escherichia coli or porphyromonas gingivalis lps. at 12, 24, or 48-hour time points, the cells were counted and the supernatant was collected for subsequent il-6 and il-8 determination in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: at the 24-hour time point, 1 nm nicotine stimulated il-6 production compared to control (p=0.02). e. coli lps alone caused a 3- to 4-fold increase in il-6 and il-8 production, whereas p gingivalis lps did not augment il-6 or il-8. a synergistic effect upregulating il-6 was observed with combined treatment of 1 mm nicotine and e. coli lps or p gingivalis lps at the 24-hour time point (p<0.0005 and p=0.002, respectively). similar effects were seen when il-8 production was evaluated following hgf stimulation with high doses of nicotine and e. coli lps or p gingivalis lps. conclusions: these results demonstrate that nicotine by itself can stimulate hgf  il-6 and il-8 production. moreover, the combination of high doses of nicotine and either e. coli or p gingivalis lps can synergistically upregulate cytokine production. these findings support the hypothesis that a proinflammatory fibroblast phenotype may be elicited in an environment enriched with bacterial lps and nicotine.

TI  == kappacin, a novel antibacterial peptide from bovine milk.
AB  == caseinomacropeptide (cmp) is a heterogeneous c-terminal fragment (residues 106 to 169) of bovine milk kappa-casein composed of glycosylated and phosphorylated forms of different genetic variants. we have demonstrated that cmp has growth-inhibitory activity against the oral opportunistic pathogens streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis and against escherichia coli. cmp was fractionated using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (rp-hplc), and each fraction was tested for activity against s. mutans in a 96-well-plate broth assay. fractions were characterized by n-terminal sequence analysis and mass spectrometry. the active form of cmp was shown to be the nonglycosylated, phosphorylated kappa-casein (residues 106 to 169) [kappa-casein(106--169)], which we have designated kappacin. endoproteinase glu-c was used to hydrolyze cmp, and the generated peptides were separated using rp-hplc and gel filtration-hplc and then tested for activity against s. mutans. the peptide ser(p)(149)kappa-casein-a(138--158) was the only peptide generated by endoproteinase glu-c digestion that exhibited growth-inhibitory activity. peptides corresponding to the sequences of the inhibitory peptide ser(p)(149)kappa-casein-a(138--158) and its nonphosphorylated counterpart kappa-casein-a(138--158) were chemically synthesized and tested for antibacterial activity. the synthetic ser(p)(149) kappa-casein-a(138--158) displayed growth-inhibitory activity against s. mutans (mic, 59 microg/ml [26 microm]). the nonphosphorylated peptide, however, did not inhibit growth at the concentrations  tested, indicating that phosphorylation is essential for activity.

TI  == the effect of oral bacteria on candida albicans germ-tube formation.
AB  == a total of eight bacterial isolates belonging to six species, and a select group  of 12 oral candida albicans isolates, were used to study the effect of bacteria on germ-tube formation. briefly, each bacterial suspension (10(5-6) cells/ml) was mixed with a c. albicans suspension (10(7) cells/ml) and incubated at 37 degrees  c for 90 min with bovine serum, and the percentage germ-tube-positive candida cells was quantified using a haemocytometer, under light microscopy. in general,  out of eight bacteria, streptococcus sanguis sk21a, streptococcus salivarius sk56, escherichia coli atcc 25922, and s. salivarius obu3 suppressed germ-tube formation to varying degrees, with different c albicans isolates. porphyromonas gingivalis pg 50, lactobacillus casei atcc 7469 and prevotella intermedia obu4 elicited significant enhancement of germ-tube formation, whereas s. sanguis obu 2 had no effect. e. coli atcc 25922 was the only organism to show statistically significant suppression of germ-tube formation (p=0.0312). a significant increase in the germ tube production of c. albicans isolated from hiv-infected compared with hiv-free individuals was also noted. the current results tend to suggest that commensal and transient oral bacterial populations may selectively influence the differential expression of germ-tube-forming ability of c. albicans isolates.

TI  == downregulation of lipopolysaccharide-induced intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression via ep2/ep4 receptors by prostaglandin e2 in human fibroblasts.
AB  == in the present study, the effect of prostaglandin e2 (pge2) on intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (icam-1) expression in human gingival fibroblasts (hgf) stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (lps) was investigated. lps were isolated from periodontopathic bacteria, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a. actinomycetemcomitans) and porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis), by the phenol-water method and escherichia coli (e. coli) lps was used as a control. pge2 significantly inhibited a. actinomycetemcomitans-, p. gingivalis- and e. coli-lps-induced icam-1 expression. next, of four pge2 receptor subtypes (ep1, ep2, ep3 and ep4), we examined which subtype(s) was involved in inhibition of lps-elicited icam-1 expression by pge2. eleven-deoxy-pge1, a selective ep2/ep4 agonist, and butaprost, a selective ep2 agonist, attenuated a. actinomycetemcomitans-, p. gingivalis- and e. coli-lps-elicited icam-1 expression, although butaprost was less potent than pge2 and 11-deoxy-pge1. sulprostone, an ep1/ep3 agonist, and ono-ap-324, an ep3 agonist, was inert to the lps-elicited icam-1 expression. furthermore, dibutyryl camp, a camp analogue, and forskolin, an adenylate cyclase activator, downregulated a. actinomycetemcomitans-, p. gingivalis- and e. coli-lps-elicited icam-1 expression in hgf. our data suggest that pge2 downregulates a. actinomycetemcomitans- and p. gingivalis-lps-induced icam-1 expression in hgf, via ep2/ep4 receptors by camp-dependent signaling pathways. the camp-elevating agents such as ep2/ep4 receptor activators may serve to control inflammatory and immune responses in periodontal disease.

TI  == effect of lipopolysaccharide from periodontal pathogens on the production of tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 by human gingival fibroblasts.
AB  == both tissue plasminogen activator (t-pa) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (pai-2) are important proteolysis factors present in inflamed human periodontal tissues. the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of lipopolysaccharide (lps) on the synthesis of t-pa and pai-2 by human gingival fibroblasts (hgf). lps from different periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium  nucleatum were extracted by the hot phenol water method. the levels of t-pa and pai-2 secreted into the cell culture media were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisa). the mrna for t-pa and pai-2 were measured by rt-pcr. the results showed t-pa synthesis was increased in response to all types  of lps studied and pai-2 level was increased by lps from a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum, but not p. gingivalis. when comparing the effects of lps from non-periodontal bacteria (escherichia coli and salmonella enteritidis) with the lps from periodontal pathogens, we found that the ratio of t-pa to pai-2 was greater following exposure of the cells to lps from periodontal pathogens. the highest ratio of t-pa to pai-2 was found in those cells exposed to lps from p. gingivalis. these results indicate that lps derived from periodontal pathogens may cause unbalanced regulation of plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor by hgf and such an effect may, in part, contribute to the destruction of periodontal connective tissue through dysregulated pericellular proteolysis.

TI  == production of inflammatory cytokines by human gingival fibroblasts stimulated by  cell-surface preparations of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is a gram-negative rod associated with the progression of human periodontal disease. inflammatory cytokines are believed to be the major pathological mediators in periodontal diseases. we therefore investigated the productions of interleukin-1beta (il-1beta), interleukin-6 (il-6), interleukin-8  (il-8), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) in human gingival fibroblasts treated with lipopolysaccharide, polysaccharide and outer-membrane proteins from  p. gingivalis atcc 53977. outer-membrane protein from p. gingivalis enhanced the  production of il-6 and il-8 from the cells of periodontium in vitro as well as lipopolysaccharide did. the il-8 production activity of polysaccharide from p. gingivalis was higher than that of other cell-surface components. the levels of il-6 and il-8 released from the p. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide-treated human gingival fibroblasts were lower than those of the same cells treated with lipopolysaccharides from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or escherichia coli. rabbit antisera against either outer-membrane protein or lipopolysaccharide inhibited the il-6 and il-8 production derived from human gingival fibroblasts stimulated sonicated supernatants from p. gingivalis. the present study suggests  that, in addition to lipopolysaccharide, outer-membrane protein and polysaccharide of p. gingivalis are also pathological mediators in periodontal diseases.

TI  == formation of methyl mercaptan from l-methionine by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == methyl mercaptan production by oral bacteria is thought to be one of the main causes of oral malodor. we examined the ability of periodontopathic porphyromonas gingivalis to produce methyl mercaptan from l-methionine and found that the invasive strains w83 and w50 produced large amounts of methyl mercaptan. we cloned and sequenced the mgl gene encoding l-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase (metase) from p. gingivalis w83. the structural mgl gene consisted of 1,200 bp and encoded a 43.3-kda protein. to examine the role of methyl mercaptan in the pathogenesis of  p. gingivalis, a metase-deficient mutant of p. gingivalis w83 was constructed. the methionine degradation activity and virulence of the mutant (m1217) and the parent strain (w83) in mice were compared. m1217 showed a marked decrease in the  formation of methyl mercaptan from l-methionine and decreased virulence compared  with the wild-type strain w83. these results suggest that methyl mercaptan not only is one of the sources of oral malodor, but may also play a role in the pathogenicity of p. gingivalis.

TI  == strain differentiation in bacteroides fragilis by ribotyping and computer-assisted gel analysis.
AB  == it is important to distinguish between bacteroides fragilis strains as their virulence may vary and as b. fragilis seems to be a heterogeneous species. the aim of our study was to evaluate ribotyping for differentiation of 46 strains of  b. fragilis and for assessment of strain heterogeneity within and between the two dna-dna homology strain groups established in this species. twenty-seven strains  belonged to johnson's dna homology group i and eight to group ii. eleven strains  had not been assigned to any group (ni group). dna from all strains was cut with  bgli, ecori and hindiii. restriction fragment length polymorphisms were investigated using a non-radioactive digoxigenin-labelled cdna probe transcribed  from escherichia coli 16s+23s rrna. ribotyping with bgli was most discriminatory, revealing a total of 26 different patterns by visual inspection of gels. ecori followed with 20 patterns and hindiii with 13 patterns. the gels from ribotyping  were processed using the dendron computer-assisted program. strain clusters established using dendron were not always in agreement with homology-based strain groups. strains of the ni group fell into both homology groups. ribotyping, as it is based on a relatively small portion of the genome, is useful for strain distinction in epidemiological studies with b. fragilis, whereas dna-dna homology, using the entire genome, is more reliable for taxonomy. the dendron computer-assisted program, which enabled objective assessment of multiple banding patterns, increased the reliability of ribotyping.

TI  == involvement of interleukin-1 in the inflammatory actions of aminobisphosphonates  in mice.
AB  == aminobisphosphonates (aminobps) are potent inhibitors of bone resorption. however, they cause undesirable inflammatory reactions, including fever, in humans. intraperitoneal injection of aminobps into mice also induces inflammatory reactions, including a prolonged elevation of the activity of the histamine-forming enzyme, histidine decarboxylase (hdc). because interleukin-1 (il-1) is a typical pyrogen and a strong inducer of hdc, we examined whether aminobps induce inflammatory reactions in mice deficient in genes for both il-1alpha and il-1beta (il-1-ko mice). in control mice, aminobps induced an elevation of hdc activity and other inflammatory reactions (enlargement of the spleen, atrophy of the thymus, exudate in the thorax and increase in granulocytic cells in the peritoneal cavity). these responses were all weak or undetectable in il-1-ko mice. we have previously shown that lipopolysaccharides (lpss) from escherichia coli and prevotella intermedia (a prevalent gram-negative bacterium both in periodontitis and endodontal infections) are capable of inducing hdc activity in various tissues in mice. in control mice treated with an aminobp, the lps-induced elevations of serum il-1 (alpha and beta) and tissue hdc activity were both markedly augmented. however, such an augmentation of hdc activity was small or undetectable in il-1-ko mice. these results, taken together with our previous findings (i) suggest that il-1 is involved in the aminobp-induced inflammatory reactions and (ii) lead us to think that under some conditions, inflammatory reactions induced by gram-negative bacteria might be augmented in patients treated with an aminobp. in this study, we also obtained a result suggesting that il-1-deficiency might be compensated by a second, unidentified, mechanism serving to induce hdc in response to lps when il-1 is lacking.

AB  == we cloned four genes from the porphyromonas gingivalis chromosome, the gene products of which catalyze the anabolism of dtdp-l-rhamnose from d-glucose-1-phosphate when they were expressed in escherichia coli. the amino acid sequences deduced from these genes showed significant homology to proteins encoded by the rml genes involved in dtdp-l-rhamnose biosynthesis in other gram-negative bacteria. reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis  revealed that these four genes are expressed as a single transcript in p. gingivalis. to clarify the role of the rml gene homologs in this organism, construction of mutants defective in the rml gene homologs was attempted by allelic exchange. unexpectedly, any mutants defective in the rml gene homologs were unable to be isolated, and the allelic exchange was possible only if the wild-type rml gene homologs were present on the chromosome. these results suggest that the rml gene homologs might be essential for the viability of p. gingivalis  under the culture conditions used in this study.

TI  == inducible expression of human beta-defensin 2 by fusobacterium nucleatum in oral  epithelial cells: multiple signaling pathways and role of commensal bacteria in innate immunity and the epithelial barrier.
AB  == human gingival epithelial cells (hge) express two antimicrobial peptides of the beta-defensin family, human beta-defensin 1 (hbd-1) and hbd-2, as well as cytokines and chemokines that contribute to innate immunity. in the present study, the expression and transcriptional regulation of hbd-2 was examined. hbd-2 mrna was induced by cell wall extract of fusobacterium nucleatum, an oral commensal microorganism, but not by that of porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontal pathogen. hbd-2 mrna was also induced by the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and phorbol myristate acetate (pma), an epithelial cell activator. hbd-2 mrna was also expressed in 14 of 15 noninflamed  gingival tissue samples. hbd-2 peptide was detected by immunofluorescence in hge  stimulated with f. nucleatum cell wall, consistent with induction of the mrna by  this stimulant. kinetic analysis indicates involvement of multiple distinct signaling pathways in the regulation of hbd-2 mrna; tnf-alpha and f. nucleatum cell wall induced hbd-2 mrna rapidly (2 to 4 h), while pma stimulation was slower ( approximately 10 h). in contrast, each stimulant induced interleukin 8 (il-8) within 1 h. the role of tnf-alpha as an intermediary in f. nucleatum signaling was ruled out by addition of anti-tnf-alpha that did not inhibit hbd-2 induction. however, inhibitor studies show that f. nucleatum stimulation of hbd-2 mrna requires both new gene transcription and new protein synthesis. bacterial lipopolysaccharides isolated from escherichia coli and f. nucleatum were poor stimulants of hbd-2, although they up-regulated il-8 mrna. collectively, our findings show inducible expression of hbd-2 mrna via multiple pathways in hge in  a pattern that is distinct from that of il-8 expression. we suggest that different aspects of innate immune responses are differentially regulated and that commensal organisms have a role in stimulating mucosal epithelial cells in maintaining the barrier that contributes to homeostasis and host defense.

AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is a major etiologic agent of periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease that ultimately results in the loss of the supporting tissues of the teeth. previous work has demonstrated the usefulness of avirulent  salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strains as antigen delivery systems for protective antigens of pathogens that colonize or cross mucosal surfaces. in this study, we constructed and characterized a recombinant s. enterica serovar typhimurium avirulent vaccine strain which expresses hemagglutinin a and carries  no antibiotic resistance markers. haga, a major virulence-associated surface protein, is a potentially useful immunogen that contains an antigenic epitope which, in humans, elicits an immune response that is protective against subsequent colonization by p. gingivalis. the haga gene, including its promoter,  was cloned into a balanced-lethal salmonella vector and transferred to the vaccine strain. heterologous expression of haga was demonstrated in both escherichia coli jm109 and s. enterica serovar typhimurium vaccine strain chi4072. the haga epitope was present in its native configuration as determined by immunochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy. purified recombinant haga was recognized by sera from mice immunized with the s. enterica serovar typhimurium vaccine strain. the haga-specific antigen of the vaccine was also found to be recognized by serum from a periodontal patient. this vaccine strain, which expresses the functional hemagglutinin protein, induces a humoral immune response against haga and may be useful for developing a protective vaccine against periodontal diseases associated with p. gingivalis.

TI  == identification and cloning of genes from porphyromonas gingivalis after mutagenesis with a modified tn4400 transposon from bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is a gram-negative, black-pigmented, oral anaerobe strongly associated with adult periodontitis. previous transposon mutagenesis studies with this organism were based on the bacteroides transposon tn4351. characterization of tn4351-disrupted genes by cloning has not been an efficient way to analyze large numbers of mutants and is further complicated by the high rate of cointegration of the suicide delivery vector containing tn4351. in this study, we mutagenized p. gingivalis with a modified version of the bacteroides fragilis transposon tn4400. plasmid pyt646b carrying the transposon was mobilized from escherichia coli to p. gingivalis atcc 33277 by conjugation. both normal and inverse transposition frequencies were similar (3 x 10(-8)). however, the inverse transposon (tn4400') contains a pbr322 replicon and a beta-lactamase gene; thus,  the cloning of disrupted genomic dnas from inverse transposition mutants was easily accomplished after ligation of genomic fragments and transformation into e. coli. thousands of transconjugants could be obtained in a single mating experiment, and inverse transposition was random as demonstrated by southern hybridization. by this procedure the disrupted genes from p. gingivalis pleiotropic mutants were quickly cloned, sequenced, and identified.

TI  == possible potentiation of toxins from prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and porphyromonas gingivalis by cotinine.
AB  == background: smoking is a recognized risk factor for the initiation and progression of periodontitis. however, the mechanism by which smoking induces its negative effects on the periodontium is not clear. this study aimed to test the hypothesis that synergy may occur between cotinine and bacterial products isolated from 3 putative periodontopathogens. methods: a chick embryo toxin assay was used to investigate bacterial toxins (cell-free extracellular toxins and cell-free cell lysates) from 5 species with and without cotinine. a total of 9 putative periodontopathogens (3 species) and 2 non-oral controls (2 species) were studied. the periodontal species were: prevotella intermedia (n = 4), prevotella  nigrescens (n = 4), and porphyromonas gingivalis (n = 1). the control species tested were: staphylococcus aureus (n = 1) and escherichia coli (n = 1). results: the toxicity kill was significantly greater than expected by simple addition alone (p <0.05, fisher's exact test) between cotinine (800 ng/ml) and 1) the cell-free extracellular toxins of p. nigrescens mh1 and 2) the cell-free cell lysates of p. intermedia mh2. synergy occurred with cotinine plus the cell-free extracellular toxins in all but 3 periodontal isolates, and the cell-free cell lysates in all but 2 periodontal isolates. cotinine significantly (p <0.05, fisher's exact test) enhanced the effects of cell-free extracellular toxins and cell lysates from one control species (e. coli), but not the other (s. aureus). conclusions: these findings indicate that synergy in an in vitro assay can occur  between cotinine and toxins from putative periodontopathogens. this may be one important mechanism by which smoking increases the severity of periodontitis.

TI  == increase of cd26/dipeptidyl peptidase iv expression on human gingival fibroblasts upon stimulation with cytokines and bacterial components.
AB  == cd26/dipeptidyl peptidase iv (dppiv) is a cell surface ectoenzyme which participates in immune and inflammatory reactions. we found that cd26 was only partially expressed on human fibroblasts from periodontal tissues, whereas fibroblasts from lung and skin expressed cd26 constitutively as revealed by flow  cytometry. we examined the possible upregulation of cd26 expression on human gingival fibroblasts in response to various stimulants. interleukin-1alpha (il-1alpha); tumor necrosis factor alpha; gamma interferon; lipopolysaccharide from porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and escherichia coli; and prevotella glycoprotein augmented cd26 expression on gingival fibroblasts. among  the stimulants, il-1alpha exhibited the most potent activity. enzymatic activity  of cd26 induced by il-1alpha on fibroblasts was determined colorimetrically in terms of gly-pro hydrolysis of a synthetic chromogenic substrate, gly-pro p-nitroanilide. among various inhibitors tested, diprotin a and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride inhibited the enzymatic activity, suggesting that the enzyme induced by il-1alpha was dppiv. the upregulation of cd26 mrna expression upon stimulation with il-1alpha was also revealed by a quantitative reverse transcription-pcr assay. in the kinetic experiment, 48 h and several days were required for maximum cd26 mrna accumulation and cd26 molecule expression on  the cell surface, respectively. the addition of cycloheximide at 2 h before il-1alpha stimulation almost completely inhibited the accumulation of cd26 mrna.  these results suggested that induction of cd26 on human gingival fibroblasts is regulated at the transcriptional level and is also dependent on a de novo-synthesized protein factor(s).

TI  == cloning of prevotella intermedia loci demonstrating multiple hemolytic domains.
AB  == a gene bank was created from prevotella intermedia strain 27 chromosomal dna, and a clone was isolated that conferred the expression of two separate modes of hemolytic activity in recombinant escherichia coli. the original recombinant hemolytic strain (eb34) contained plasmid, peb34, with a 5.6-kb insert from sau 3 ai-digested p. intermedia strain 27 chromosomal dna cloned into the bam hi site of puc18. eb34 and deletion subclones were tested for expression of hemolytic activity in a standard tube assay, measuring lysis of erythrocytes spectrophotometrically as a function of hemoglobin release. cell suspensions of eb34 demonstrated a dose-dependent hemolytic activity, inhibitable by proteases,  and heat treatment but not dependent on calcium ions, and not inhibitable by osmoprotectants. cell-free lysates also demonstrated a heat inhibitable, dose dependent hemolytic activity. sub-cloning experiments localized the hemolytic region of the insert to a 3.9-kb fragment under direction of the lac promoter. sequence analysis of the entire insert revealed the presence of multiple open reading frames (1 to 3) in this region which correlated to different forms of hemolytic expression, such that subclones containing all open reading frames 1 to 3 demonstrated strong hemolytic phenotype on blood plates and in the tube assay.  subclones containing only orf1 demonstrated hemolysis on plates, but not in the tube assay. subclones containing only open reading frames 2 and 3, but not orf1 demonstrated hemolysis in the tube assay but not on plates. homology searches of  dna and protein databases have not revealed significant homologies with reported  hemolysins or proteins in any of the open reading frames.

TI  == host responses to recombinant hemagglutinin b of porphyromonas gingivalis in an experimental rat model.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, a gram-negative, black-pigmented anaerobe, is among the microorganisms implicated in the etiology of adult periodontal disease. this bacterium possesses a number of factors, including hemagglutinins, of potential importance in virulence. several hemagglutinin genes have been identified, cloned, and expressed in escherichia coli. the purpose of this study was to characterize host responses to purified recombinant hemagglutinin b (rhag b), using the conventional fischer rat as the experimental animal model. the effectiveness of immunization with rhag b on protection against experimental periodontal bone loss following infection with p. gingivalis was also evaluated.  groups of rats were immunized by the subcutaneous route with rhag b in complete freund's adjuvant, immunized with rhag b and orally infected with p. gingivalis,  nonimmunized and noninfected, or orally infected with p. gingivalis only. serum and saliva samples were collected throughout the experiment and evaluated for serum immunoglobulin g (igg) and igm and salivary iga antibody activity by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. no salivary iga anti-hag b activity was detected in the various groups of rats. a slight serum igm response similar to that seen in preimmune samples was observed. serum igg antibody activity to hag b was detected only in samples from rats immunized with rhag b. this response was primarily of the igg1 and igg2a subclasses, followed by igg2b and low levels of igg2c. supernatants from rhag b-stimulated splenic lymphoid cell cultures from immunized rats contained high levels of gamma interferon, followed by interleukin-2 (il-2), il-10, and then il-4. these results are consistent with the induction of t helper type 1 (th1)- and th2-like responses. western blot analysis of sera derived from rhag b-immunized rats reacted with trichloroacetic acid (tca) precipitates of p. gingivalis 33277, 381, a7a1-28, and w50, revealing a 50-kda band reflective of hag b. however, sera derived from rats immunized with p. gingivalis whole cells or from rats infected with p. gingivalis only did not react with rhag b but did react with tca precipitates of p. gingivalis strains. finally, radiographic measurements of periodontal bone loss indicated that rats immunized with rhag b had less bone loss than those infected with p. gingivalis only. these results demonstrate the effectiveness of purified rhag b in inducing  a protective immune response and support the potential usefulness of this component of p. gingivalis in the development of a vaccine against adult periodontitis.

TI  == soluble cd14-dependent intercellular adhesion molecular-1 induction by porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide in human gingival fibroblasts.
AB  == background: intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (icam-1) is involved in the accumulation and activation of leukocytes in inflammatory sites through binding to beta2 integrins expressed on leukocytes. we investigated whether or not lipopolysaccharide (lps) derived from the periodontopathic bacterium porphyromonas gingiualis affects icam-1 expression on human gingival fibroblasts  (hgf). cd14 is a receptor for lps on monocytes and macrophages and is also present in serum as a soluble protein. we further examined the effects of serum and soluble cd14 (scd14) on icam-1 expression in hgf stimulated with p. gingivalis lps. methods: hgf were prepared from explants of human gingival tissues and incubated in 96-well culture plates before lps stimulation. lps derived from escherichia coli o55:b5 and p. gingivalis atcc 33277 lps were employed. scd14 was purified from normal human serum (nhs) by affinity chromatography using an anti-cd14 monoclonal antibody. icam-1 expression on hgf was measured by a cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: p. gingivalis  lps induced icam-1 on hgf in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of either 10% fetal calf serum or 2% nhs. the ability of p. gingivalis lps to induce icam-1 was comparable to that of lps from e. coli at high lps concentrations. in the absence of nhs, icam-1 induction was negligible in hgf stimulated with p. gingivalis lps, reaching a maximum at 2% nhs. the icam-1 expression induced by p. gingivalis lps was inhibited by a monoclonal antibody to cd14. supplementation of serum-free medium with scd14 alone restored the capacity of hgf to respond to p.  gingivalis lps. conclusions: these results indicate that p. gingivalis lps induces icam-1 expression in hgf in an scd14-dependent manner. the overexpression of icam-1 on fibroblasts in gingiva induced by p. gingivalis lps seems to be involved in the retention of inflammatory cells in periodontitis lesions.

TI  == variable carbohydrate modifications to the catalytic chains of the rgpa and rgpb  proteases of porphyromonas gingivalis w50.
AB  == proteases of porphyromonas gingivalis are considered to be important virulence determinants of this periodontal bacterium. several biochemical isoforms of arginine-specific proteases are derived from rgpa and rgpb. hrgpa is a heterodimer composed of the catalytic alpha chain noncovalently associated with a beta adhesin chain derived from the c terminus of the initial full-length translation product. the catalytic alpha chain is also present as a monomer (rgpa) either free in solution or associated with membranes. rgpb lacks the coding region for the adhesin domain present in rgpa and yields only monomeric forms (rgpb) which again may be soluble or membrane associated. in this study, the catalytic chains of this unusual group of enzymes are shown to be differentially modified by the posttranslational addition of carbohydrate. a monoclonal antibody (mab 1b5) raised to the monomeric rgpa did not react with the corresponding recombinant rgpa alpha chain expressed in escherichia coli but was  immunoreactive with p. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide. mab 1b5 also reacted with the membrane-associated forms of rgpa and rgpb but not with the heterodimeric hrgpa and the soluble form of rgpb. rgpa treated with denaturants was capable of  binding to mab 1b5 whereas treatment with periodate abolished this binding, suggesting the presence of carbohydrate residues within the epitope. chemical deglycosylation abolished immunoreactivity with mab 1b5 and caused a approximately 30% reduction in the size of the membrane-associated enzymes. monosaccharide analysis of hrgpa and rgpa demonstrated 2.1 and 14.4%, respectively, carbohydrate by weight of protein. furthermore, distinct differences were detected in their monosaccharide compositions, indicating that these protease isoforms are modified not only to different extents but also with  different sugars. the variable nature of these additions may have a significant effect on the structure, stability, and immune recognition of these protease glycoproteins.

TI  == mutant analysis of prevotella sp. plaa-lacz fusion protein expression in escherichia coli: support for an essential role of the stem-loop.
AB  == this study investigated the involvement of rna folding in the synthesis of a fusion protein with beta-galactosidase activity. the coding gap region of the prevotella loescheii adhesin gene plaa was fused in-frame with the escherichia coli lacz gene on plasmid psk105. n-terminal sequencing of the expressed plaa-lacz protein indicated that it resulted from translational initiation at a fortuitous ribosomal-binding site within the plaa sequence at nt 570. specific mutations were introduced in the stem-loop region that precedes the gap sequence. analysis of stem-loop mutants, together with the introduction of compensatory mutations that restored activity, supports a requirement for stem-loop formation  within the plaa sequence preceding the translational initiation site. a mutation  reducing the predicted size of the loop, but preserving the stem structure, inactivated fusion protein synthesis. a suppressor mutation predicted to restore  the size of the loop restored efficient fusion protein synthesis. in addition, the sequence preceding the translational start site of the plaa-lacz fusion has several similarities to sequences that function as translational enhancers in prokaryotes. these include a stem-loop structure, an a-u rich region preceding the initiation codon, and a region of homology to 16s rrna.

AB  == several proteins of porphyromonas gingivalis contain multiple copies of a 47 amino acid conserved repeated sequence. a fusion protein was constructed in which the p. gingivalis peptide was fused to the carboxy terminus of the hepatitis b core protein. this fusion protein was expressed in escherichia coli, purified, and used to vaccinate mice that were later challenged with p. gingivalis w83 using the mouse abscess model. although the mice were not protected against bacterial challenge, western blot analysis showed that sera from the mice and from rabbits immunized with the fusion protein reacted with a number of vesicle proteins from p. gingivalis w83. these data suggested that this peptide is recognized by the host's immune system but that the antibodies are not protective.

TI  == interleukin (il)-1 and porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide stimulation of il-6 production by fibroblasts derived from healthy or periodontally diseased human gingival tissue.
AB  == background: human gingival fibroblasts (hgf) play a key role in tissue repair and destruction. these cells express low levels of interleukin (il)-6 constitutively  and increased levels after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (lps) or the cytokines il-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha). however, little information is available on il-6 production by fibroblasts derived from diseased  tissue. the present study compared constitutive and induced il-6 production by human gingival fibroblasts (hgf) derived from healthy and diseased periodontal tissue. we also evaluated whether il-1 acted in a synergistic manner with lps in  inducing il-6 production by hgf and whether lps acted via cd14. methods: hgf derived from healthy and diseased tissue and foreskin fibroblasts were grown to confluency, photographed, and counted, and their constitutive il-6 production was quantitated by elisa. healthy and diseased hgf were also pretreated with il-1alpha, followed by incubation with porphyromonas gingivalis or escherichia coli lps. culture supernatants were assessed for il-6 protein by elisa and cell lysates for mrna by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). in  order to determine if lps stimulation was mediated through the lps receptor, cd14, surface receptors on hgf were assessed by flow cytometry and the total rna  cd14 mrna was assessed. results: higher quantities of il-6 were produced by the diseased hgf before and after stimulation than by the healthy hgf. pretreatment with il-1alpha followed by lps stimulation of the healthy and diseased hgf cell lines resulted in an additive effect on il-6 production. pretreatment with il-1alpha followed by a second incubation with the same stimulant produced higher amounts of il-6 than cultures incubated with lps alone or following il-1alpha pretreatment. similar amounts of il-6 mrna were present in unstimulated hgf from  either diseased or healthy tissue and in those incubated with il-1alpha only. after incubation with il-1alpha and lps, diseased hgf produced slightly more mrna than healthy hgf. cd14 was not expressed by healthy or diseased hgf even after stimulation with either p. gingivalis or e. coli lps. cd14 message was also undetectable. conclusions: taken together, these results indicate heterogeneity among gingival fibroblasts and an additive effect of il-1 and p. gingivalis lps on il-6 production by hgf. furthermore, the lps effect on hgf was not mediated by cd14.

TI  == induction of anti-thymocyte/t lymphocyte antibodies in mice injected with lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == we examined the levels of anti-thymocyte/t lymphocyte autoantibody (ata) in the serum of mice injected intraperitoneally with lipopolysaccharides (lps) from periodontopathic bacteria; porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga ochracea, and non-oral escherichia coli. all of the lps induced igm-ata. among these, lps from  c. ochracea induced the highest level of igm-ata, whereas that of p. gingivalis induced the lowest. the peritoneal t lymphocytes of mice injected with lps were bound by igm-ata. peritoneal b-1 (cd5+b) cells stimulated by each lps produced much more igm-ata than splenic b-2 (cd5-b) cells, suggesting that b-1 cells might be responsible for the production of these antibodies. serum of mice injected with c. ochracea and f. nucleatum lps showed cytotoxicity against thymocytes in the presence of rabbit complements. binding and cytotoxicity were confirmed by igm purified from serum of the mice injected with c. ochracea lps. furthermore, serum of mice treated with c. ochracea, f. nucleatum or a. actinomycetemcomitans  lps inhibited the proliferation of thymocytes. however, purified igm from the serum of mice treated with c. ochracea lps failed to produce the same inhibition. our results suggest that lps from certain species of periodontopathic bacteria can induce igm-ata in the serum and these antibodies may modulate the local immune network in periodontal tissues.

TI  == induction of prostaglandin release from macrophages by bacterial endotoxin.
AB  == this review summarizes the role of the monocytic responses to lipopolysaccharide  as it relates to periodontal disease severity. data are presented which illustrate that the levels of prostaglandin e2 (pge2) secreted by systemic peripheral blood monocytes in culture, in the presence of bacterial endotoxins, are highly correlated with the levels observed in the gingival crevicular fluid.  furthermore, the different periodontal diagnostic categories have varying levels  of monocytic and crevicular fluid pge2, in juxtaposition with clinical disease severity. these data are consistent with the concept that there is close synchrony between the systemic responsiveness of peripheral blood monocytes with  regard to prostanoid synthesis and the local levels of mediator present within the gingival crevice.

TI  == clinical and microbiological characteristics of smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  == cigarette smoking is a potential risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. the objective of this study was to compare  the microbial profile of smokers and non-smokers in a group of patients with early onset periodontitis. the study population consisted of 60 healthy individuals, 40 males and 20 females aged 22 to 35 yr, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. thirty patients were smokers (30.9 cigarettes/d) and 30 non-smokers. smokers had a higher proportion of deep pockets (pd >5 mm), especially in the maxilla anterior and premolar regions (p < 0.001) and presented a significantly greater mean probing depth and attachment loss (p <0.05) in diseased sites and a significantly greater alveolar bone loss (p <0.01) compared  to non-smokers. two pooled bacterial samples were obtained from each patient. samples were collected from the deepest periodontal pockets of each quadrant. the samples were cultured anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits.  smokers harboured a greater number of bacteria in total. analysis of bacterial counts using the anova (mann-whitney u-test) showed that staphylococcus aureus, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter concisus, escherichia coli, bacteroides  forsythus, c. gracilis, c. rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, selenomonas sputigena, candida albicans and aspergillus fumigatus were found in significantly higher numbers and more frequently in smokers while streptococcus intermedius, a. naeslundii, a. israelii and eubacterium lentum were detected more frequently and  in significantly higher proportions in non-smokers. the isolation of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora such as e. coli, c. albicans, a. fumigatus and s. aureus in smokers' microbiota underscores the importance of the host that is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.

TI  == activities of the porphyromonas gingivalis prtp proteinase determined by construction of prtp-deficient mutants and expression of the gene in bacteroides  species.
AB  == prtp is a major cysteine proteinase of porphyromonas gingivalis. the gene encoding this proteinase, prtp, was cloned into the escherichia coli-bacteroides  shuttle vectors pfd288 and pfd340 and was expressed in bacteroides cells, apparently under the control of its own promoter, when in pfd288, or a bacteroides promoter present on pfd340. proteolytically active prtp was detected  by fibrinogen zymography in cells or spent growth medium of several bacteroides species harboring the recombinant plasmids. the proteinase was recovered from bacteroides fragilis atcc 25285(pfd340-prtp) cells by 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethyl-ammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (chaps) extraction and characterized with regard to exopeptidase specificity and sensitivity to proteinase inhibitors. lys-amidolytic activity, but not arg-amidolytic activity,  was detected. prtp was activated by cysteine and, to a lesser extent, dithiothreitol, and it was stimulated by glycine-containing compounds. it also was inhibited by nalpha-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (tlck) and, to a lesser extent, h-d-tyr-l-pro-l-arginyl chloromethyl ketone (yprck) and was relatively insensitive to edta and leupeptin. neither b. fragilis atcc 25285(pfd340-prtp) cells nor the chaps extract effected hemagglutination of sheep red blood cells or collagen cleavage, but the cells did cleave gelatin. furthermore, p. gingivalis w12, atcc 33277, kdp110, and hg66 with knockout mutations in prtp were constructed by allelic replacement. unlike the parent strains, the mutant strains produced beige colonies on plates containing sheep blood. these strains also were affected in their ability to effect hemagglutination, cleave collagen, and cleave a lys-specific peptide substrate. this report presents the results of the first characterization of the prtp proteinase clearly in the absence of any influence by other p. gingivalis proteins and describes the properties of p. gingivalis cells defective in the production of prtp.

AB  == bacteroides forsythus is a recently recognized human periodontopathogen associated with advanced, as well as recurrent, periodontitis. however, very little is known about the mechanism of pathogenesis of this organism. the present study was undertaken to identify the surface molecules of this bacterium that may play roles in its adherence to oral tissues or triggering of a host immune response(s). the gene (bspa) encoding a cell surface-associated protein of b. forsythus with an apparent molecular mass of 98 kda was isolated by immunoscreening of a b. forsythus gene library constructed in a lambda zap ii vector. the encoded 98-kda protein (bspa) contains 14 complete repeats of 23 amino acid residues that show partial homology to leucine-rich repeat motifs. a recombinant protein containing the repeat region was expressed in escherichia coli, purified, and utilized for antibody production, as well as in vitro binding studies. the purified recombinant protein bound strongly to fibronectin and fibrinogen in a dose-dependent manner and further inhibited the binding of b. forsythus cells to these extracellular matrix (ecm) components. in addition, adult patients with b. forsythus-associated periodontitis expressed specific antibodies against the bspa protein. we report here the cloning and expression of an immunogenic cell surface-associated protein (bspa) of b. forsythus and speculate that it mediates the binding of bacteria to ecm components and clotting factors (fibronectin and fibrinogen, respectively), which may be important in the colonization of the oral cavity by this bacterium and is also a target for the host immune response.

AB  == little is known regarding the molecules expressed by gingival epithelial cells that are involved in initiating and maintaining inflammation following the interaction with periodontal pathogens. thus, we investigated the effect of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis infection on the expression of neutrophil chemoattractant interleukin 8 (il-8) and the adhesion molecule intercellular adhesion molecule-1 by gingival epithelial cells. the data revealed that both il-8 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression increased after infection with a. actinomycetemcomitans (il-8: 2- to 7-fold; intercellular adhesion molecule-1: 2.5- to 3.7-fold). il-8 secretion reached a maximal level 6 h after the infection and the expression subsequently decreased to basal level. the increased cell surface intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression started at 4 h after infection and reached a maximal level 14 h after  the infection. in contrast, the expression of both molecules rapidly decreased 2  h after challenge with p. gingivalis. this opposite influence of a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis infection on the expression of il-8 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 by gingival epithelial cells suggests that a. actinomycetemcomitans infection may initiate the recruitment of neutrophils, whereas the p. gingivalis infection may retard this process and therefore demonstrate a distinct perspective of virulence.

AB  == prolyl-phenylalanine-specific serine protease (dentilisin) is a major extracellular protease produced by treponema denticola. the gene, prtp, coding for the protease was recently cloned and sequenced (k. ishihara, t. miura, h. k.  kuramitsu, and k. okuda, infect. immun. 64:5178-5186, 1996). in order to determine the role of this protease in the physiology and virulence of t. denticola, a dentilisin-deficient mutant, k1, was constructed following electroporation with a prtp-inactivated dna fragment. no chymotrypsin-like protease activity was detected in the dentilisin-deficient mutant. in addition, the high-molecular-mass oligomeric protein characteristic of the outer sheath of  the organism decreased in the mutant. furthermore, the hydrophobicity of the mutant was decreased, and coaggregation of the mutant with fusobacterium nucleatum was enhanced compared to that of the wild-type organism. the results obtained with a mouse abscess model system indicated that the virulence of the mutant was attenuated relative to that of the wild-type organism. these results suggest that dentilisin activity plays a major role in the structural organization of the outer sheath of t. denticola. the loss of dentilsin activity  and the structural change in the outer sheath affect the pathogenicity of t. denticola.

TI  == development of a bifunctional xylosidase/arabinosidase gene as a reporter gene for the gram-negative anaerobes bacteroides and porphyromonas, and escherichia coli.
AB  == members of the genera bacteroides and porphyromonas are common inhabitants of the human intestinal and oral microflora, and certain species are capable of causing  disease states in humans. genetic studies of these organisms are important for determining factors involved in the development of such diseases. a reporter gene for transcriptional fusions may prove useful for studies of gene regulation in these organisms. bacteroides ovatus is a normal inhabitant of the human intestinal tract and is one of the few bacteroides species capable of degrading xylan, a major component of fiber in the diet. a gene encoding for a bifunctional xylosidase/arabinosidase (xa) enzyme was previously cloned in our laboratory from b. ovatus v975 as part of a xylan-inducible operon. the xa gene was isolated by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into the e. coli plasmid pbluescript ii ks+. the xa gene is under transcriptional regulation in e. coli by the lac promoter, and both activities can be induced with isopropylthio-beta-galactoside  (iptg). the xa gene was subcloned into e. coli/bacteroides shuttle vectors and introduced by conjugation into different bacteroides species and porphyromonas gingivalis. the results of transcriptional fusions in bacteroides species and e.  coli were evaluated. the characteristics of the xa reporter system are the low background or total lack of arabinosidase and xylosidase activities in most bacteroides species, p. gingivalis, and e. coli, and the ease of enzymatic assays. in addition, bacterial colonies can be screened directly on agar plates by fluorescence with methylumbelliferyl derivatives as substrates for either enzymatic activity.

TI  == immunobiological activities of chemically defined lipid a from helicobacter pylori lps in comparison with porphyromonas gingivalis lipid a and escherichia coli-type synthetic lipid a (compound 506).
AB  == helicobacter pylori lipid a, characterised by a glucosamine beta (1-6) disaccharide 1-(2-aminoethyl)phosphate acylated by (r)-3-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid and (r)-3-(octadecanoyloxy)octadecanoic acid at the 2- and 2'-positions, respectively, exhibited no or very low endotoxic activities, i.e. lethal toxicity in galactosamine-loaded mice, pyrogenicity for rabbits and the activity of the limulus test compared with escherichia coli-type synthetic lipid a (compound 506), which possesses beta-(1-6)-linked glucosamine disaccharide 1,4'-bisphosphate, with two acyloxyacyl groups at the 2'- and 3'-positions and two 3-hydroxytetradecanoyl groups at the 2- and 3-positions. the endotoxic properties of h. pylori lipid a were also a little weaker than those of the low endotoxic lipid a of p. gingivalis, which has 1-phospho beta-(1-6)-linked glucosamine disaccharide with 3-hydroxy-15-methylhexadecanoyl and 3-hexadecanoyloxy-15-methylhexadecanoyl groups at the 2- and 2'-positions, respectively. further, the mitogenic activity of h. pylori lipid a in murine splenic mononuclear cells was also less than those of p. gingivalis lipid a and compound 506. however, h. pylori lipid a induced comparable production of interleukin-6 (il-6) by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) compared  with p. gingivalis lipid a and compound 506. h. pylori lipid a also increased human natural killer cell activity, and strongly agglutinated rabbit erythrocytes. however, the lipid as of h. pylori and p. gingivalis showed lower activities in inducing tumour necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) production by human pbmc and il-8 production by human gingival fibroblasts than that of compound 506. the structural feature of h. pylori lipid a may be associated with  low endotoxic properties and potent immunobiological activities.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis infection of oral epithelium inhibits neutrophil transepithelial migration.
AB  == periodontal diseases are inflammatory disorders caused by microorganisms of dental plaque that colonize the gingival sulcus and, subsequently, the periodontal pocket. as in other mucosal infections, the host response to plaque bacteria is characterized by an influx of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns) to  the gingival crevice. neutrophil migration through the epithelial lining of the gingival pocket is thought to be the first line of defense against plaque bacteria. in order to model this phenomenon in vitro, we used the oral epithelial cell line kb and human pmns in the transwell system and examined the impact of porphyromonas gingivalis-epithelial cell interactions on subsequent pmn transepithelial migration. we demonstrate here that p. gingivalis infection of oral epithelial cells failed to trigger transmigration of pmns. furthermore, it significantly inhibited neutrophil transmigration actively induced by stimuli such as n-formylmethionyl leucyl phenylalanine, interleukin-8 (il-8), and the intestinal pathogen enterotoxigenic escherichia coli. the ability of p. gingivalis to block pmn transmigration was strongly positively correlated with the ability to adhere to and invade epithelial cells. in addition, p. gingivalis  attenuated the production of il-8 and the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 by epithelial cells. the ability of p. gingivalis to block neutrophil  migration across an intact epithelial barrier may critically impair the potential of the host to confront the bacterial challenge and thus may play an important role in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease.

TI  == transcriptional analysis of the groesl operon from porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == transcriptional analysis of the groesl operon from porphyromonas gingivalis, one  of the obligative anaerobic oral microorganisms implicated in adult periodontitis, was performed. p. gingivalis 381 cultured at 37 degrees c was shifted to 42 degrees c, 45 degrees c or 48 degrees c for 10 mins. northern hybridization analysis revealed that a band with 2.1-kb (kilo base pair) was observed, and the transcripts increased greatly by heat shock. primer extension and s1 mapping detected four different 5'-ending sites of the mrnas at the upstream region of the groes. three sites out of the four were heat-inducible. there were inverted repeats and a escherichia coli sigma 32-recognizing consensus sequence in the promoter region of the groesl, which may be relevant to the regulation of transcription of groesl operon in p. gingivalis. both a heat shock  promoter and inverted repeats may be relevant to the transcriptional regulation of the groesl operon in p. gingivalis.

TI  == construction of a plasmid vector for transformation of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == a host-vector system for transformation of porphyromonas gingivalis was constructed using a set (1) strains that can incorporate plasmid dna by electroporation regardless of its source and (2) stable vector plasmids with a selectable marker. first, restriction-negative mutants were isolated, because p.  gingivalis possesses restriction modification systems by which dna introduced by  transformation even from heterologous strains of the same species is excluded. for screening of the mutants, plasmid pe5-2 was employed since it could be transconjugated (mobilized) to p. gingivalis from escherichia coli and is able to replicate in this species, albeit not stably. pe5-2 dna prepared from e coli was  introduced by electroporation into chemically mutagenized p. gingivalis cells. by this method, three putative restriction-negative clones were selected. these strains exhibited a capacity for electroporation with plasmid dnas both from e. coli and from various p. gingivalis strains at a similar efficiency. using one of the derivatives thus obtained, yh522, we then screened for plasmids that could replicate stably in p. gingivalis. since no plasmids were found from p. gingivalis, cryptic plasmids from other species of black-pigmented oral anaerobic rods were examined for their ability to transform p. gingivalis. a series of plasmids constructed by ligation with pbr322 for replication in e. coli and the ecori-b fragment from pbf4 containing erythromycin resistance were prepared from  e. coli and were used for electroporation of p. gingivalis. among these, a recombinant plasmid containing the replicon of pyhba1 from porphyromonas asaccharolytica, designated pyh400, was found to be incorporated into the restriction-negative p. gingivalis strain and replicated stably. this set of recipient strains and stable plasmids with a selectable marker constitutes the first practical host-vector system for this species.

TI  == isolation and characterization of a nonpigmented variant of porphyromonas endodontalis.
AB  == porphyromonas endodontalis forms dark colonies on media containing blood. we isolated, from an infected root canal, a non-black-pigmented p. endodontalis variant, ksew01, which forms beige colonies on blood agar media. to characterize  this variant, we compared its properties with those of two black-pigmented p. endodontalis strains, atcc35406 and kse105. strain ksew01 had a gelatinase activity comparable to that of the pigmented strains. cell lysates of these three strains resolved by sds-page electrophoresis showed similar protein patterns. quantitative dna-dna hybridization experiments indicated high homology between the nonpigmented strain ksew01 and the two dark-pigmented strains. from these results, we identified strain ksew01 as a p. endodontalis nonpigmented variant. dna restriction endonuclease analysis indicated that the variant was closely related to a pigmented strain, kse105. in contrast to the pigmented strains, strain ksew01 did not degrade hemoglobin and formed no vesicles when cultured in  the presence of blood. the susceptibilities of these three strains to 22 antibiotics were similar except for vancomycin. the nonpigmented variant was the  most resistant to vancomycin (mic: atcc35406, 6.25 micrograms/ml; kse105,12.5 micrograms/ml; ksew01, 100 micrograms/ml). overall, a relationship may exist between the presence of black-pigmentation and outer membrane systems of p. endodontalis.

TI  == extracts of prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans inhibit alkaline phosphatase activity in osteoblastic cells in vitro.
AB  == in order to study the effects of sonicated extracts from prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and other oral-related bacteria, as well as escherichia coli on bone formation, clone mc3t3-e1 cells, which have retained osteoblastic activity, were cultured with various bacterial extracts. the addition of the sonicated extracts from prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans decreased the alkaline phosphatase activity in a dose-dependent fashion over the concentration  range of 1-1000 ng ml-1 compared with the control. by contrast, the sonicated extracts from other oral bacteria including porphyromonas gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, streptococcus milleri and streptococcus sanguis, and escherichia coli did not decrease the alkaline phosphatase activity even in the presence of 100 ng ml-1 protein. the addition of prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans extracts that had been treated with heat and trypsin to the cell cultures also inhibited alkaline phosphatase activity in the  cells, suggesting that inhibitory factors are not proteinaceous. polymyxin b did  not change the alkaline phosphatase activity in the cells treated with the extracts from prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, suggesting that the inhibitory activity of the extracts is not lipopolysaccharide. the inhibitory effect of both extracts was observed in the molecular mass over 290 kda eluted from sephadex g-200 column. the inhibitory substances of prevotella intermedia were partially purified and showed broad band with estimated molecular weight of 170-190 kda by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. these results indicate that prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans may play an important role in inhibiting bone formation as well as in stimulating bone resorption.

TI  == contrasting effects of lipopolysaccharides (endotoxins) from oral black-pigmented bacteria and enterobacteriaceae on platelets, a major source of serotonin, and on histamine-forming enzyme in mice.
AB  == by measurement of serotonin levels, the translocation of platelets to various tissues was examined following intravenous injection of a lipopolysaccharide (lps) into c3h/hen mice. there was a rapid platelet accumulation (within 5 min and particularly in the lung), followed by a slower accumulation in the liver, which reached its plateau 3-5 h later. the severity of the anaphylactoid shock corresponded well with the magnitude of the rapid response. lpss from the oral black-pigmented bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia, were much more potent in inducing the rapid platelet response than were those from the enterobacteriaceae escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. however, lpss from these enterobacteriaceae were significantly more potent than those from black-pigmented bacteria in inducing the slow platelet response. there was also a contrast between their abilities to induce histidine decarboxylase, which forms histamine from histidine: lpss from the enterobacteriaceae were much more potent  than those from black-pigmented bacteria.

TI  == secretion of il-1 beta, tnf-alpha, il-8 and il-1ra by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes in response to lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn) are the first cells that migrate into periodontal tissues and gingival crevices in response to invading pathogens. it was recently demonstrated that pmn have the ability to synthesize and release cytokines following appropriate stimulation, while it is not clear whether these  capacities are directly related to periodontal destructive processes. we therefore investigated the amounts of the cytokines interleukin-1 beta (il-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), il-8 and il-1 receptor antagonist (il-1ra) secreted by pmn from healthy donors following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (lps) from 4 periodontopathic bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga ochracea and fusobacterium nucleatum, and the non-oral bacterium escherichia coli. a actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and e. coli lps stimulated the release of significantly greater amounts of il-1 beta, tnf-alpha and il-8 than the control unstimulated pmn (p < 0.01). the levels of il-1 beta, tnf-alpha and il-8 released from cells stimulated with p. gingivalis or c. ochracea lps were significantly lower than those of cells stimulated with a. actinomycetemcomitans or e. coli lps (p < 0.05). on the other hand, substantially greater amounts of il-1ra were released from pmn stimulated with each lps and from control unstimulated pmn during the first 6 h, and then significantly greater amounts of il-1ra were secreted by pmn stimulated with a. actinomycetemcomitans and e.coli lps during the following 12 h (p < 0.01). the inhibitory effects of il-1ra on the biological activity of il-1 in the supernatants of pmn were examined by the thymocyte comitogen proliferation assay. the supernatants of pmn stimulated with each lps showed less biological il-1 activity as compared with the same doses of recombinant human il-1 beta detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. furthermore, no activity was detected in the supernatants of pmn stimulated with  p. gingivalis or c. ochracea lps. these findings demonstrated that lps from periodontopathic bacteria were capable of stimulating pmn to release not only pro-inflammatory cytokines but also their inhibitors such as il-1ra. different secretion levels of these cytokines and their biological activities induced by the various lps might be important in the onset and progression of periodontal diseases.

TI  == isolation and characterization of a hemin-regulated gene, hemr, from porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == an hemr (hemin-regulated) gene from porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 53977 has been  isolated and characterized. this gene is present downstream from the prtt gene, previously cloned in this laboratory. in addition, another putative gene, orf1, was identified between hemr and prtt. the complete nucleotide sequences of orf1 and hemr were determined, and the deduced amino acid sequence of orf1 and hemr proteins corresponded to 16- and 48-kda proteins, respectively. the amino termini of the hemr protein exhibited significant homology with iron-regulated, tonb-dependent outer membrane receptor proteins from various bacteria, while the  carboxyl terminus of the hemr protein displayed almost complete identity with a p. gingivalis prtt protease domain. pcr analyses confirmed the existence of such  extensive homology between the carboxyl termini of both the prtt and hemr genes on the p. gingivalis chromosome. northern blots indicated that orf1 was part of a 1.0-kb mrna and was positively regulated by hemin levels. on the other hand, the  hemr gene was apparently a part of a 3.0-kb polycistronic message and was negatively regulated at the transcriptional level by hemin. primer extension analysis of the hemr gene revealed that the transcription start site was at a c residue located within orf1. an examination of hemr::lacz constructs in both escherichia coli and p. gingivalis confirmed hemin repression of hemr expression  in both organisms. moreover, the hemr protein expressed in e. coli was detected by an antiserum from a periodontitis patient heavily colonized with p. gingivalis but not by serum from a periodontally healthy patient or by antisera against hemin-grown p. gingivalis cells. therefore, it is likely that the 48-kda hemr protein can be expressed only under hemin-restricted conditions. these results suggest that we have isolated a hemin-regulated gene, hemr, which encodes a 48-kda protein that may be a tonb-dependent outer membrane protein.

TI  == detection and comparison of specific hemin binding by porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia.
AB  == a radioligand assay was designed to detect and compare specific hemin binding by  the periodontal anaerobic black-pigmenting bacteria (bpb) porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. the assay included physiological concentrations of the hemin-binding protein rabbit serum albumin (rsa) to prevent self-aggregation and nonspecific interaction of hemin with cellular components. under these conditions, heme-starved p. intermedia cells (two strains) expressed  a single binding site species (4,100 to 4,600 sites/cell) with a dissociation constant (kd) of 1.0 x 10(-9) m. heme-starved p. gingivalis cells (two strains) expressed two binding site species; the higher-affinity site (1,000 to 1,500 sites/cell) displayed a kd of between 3.6 x 10(-11) and 9.6 x 10(-11) m, whereas  the estimated kd of the lower-affinity site (1.9 x 10(5) to 6.3 x 10(5) sites/cell) ranged between 2.6 x 10(-7) and 6.5 x 10(-8) m. specific binding was  greatly diminished in heme-replete cells of either bpb species and was not displayed by iron-replete escherichia coli cells, which bound as much hemin in the absence of rsa as did p. intermedia. hemin binding by bpb was reduced following treatment with protein-modifying agents (heat, pronase, and n-bromosuccinimide) and was blocked by protoporphyrin ix and hemoglobin but not by congo red. hemopexin also inhibited bacterial hemin binding. these findings indicate that both p. gingivalis and p. intermedia express heme-repressible proteinaceous hemin-binding sites with affinities intermediate between those of serum albumin and hemopexin. p. gingivalis exhibited a 10-fold-greater specific binding affinity and greater heme storage capacity than did p. intermedia, suggesting that the former would be ecologically advantaged with respect to heme  acquisition.

TI  == involvement of calcium in interactions between gingival epithelial cells and porphyromonas gingivalis.

AB  == the purpose of the present study was to investigate the involvement of cyclooxygenase-1(cox-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2) in pge2 production by human  gingival fibroblasts stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (lps) from periodondopathogenic bacteria. lps were isolated from porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a. actinomycetemcomitans)  and eschericia coli (e coli) by the phenol-water procedure. the three lps preparations produced pce2 up to 48 h in a time-dependent manner in human gingival fibroblasts. p. gingivalis-lps was the most potent stimulator of pge2 production and, to a lesser extent, a actinomycetemcomitans- and e coli-lps. treatment of the cells with indomethacin, a non selective cox-1/cox-2 inhibitor and ns-398, a selective cox-2 inhibitor, completely depressed pge2 production. treatment of dexamethasone, known to inhibit cox-2 expression, also significantly prevented pge2 production. immunohistochemical staining of cox-2 protein demonstrated that expression of cox-2 protein was increased at 24 h after p gingivalis-lps stimulation, while expression of cox-1 protein was not affected by p. gingivalis-lps. in order to investigate the regulation of pge2 production. p.  gingivalis-lps-stimulated cells were treated with herbimycin a and genistein, both inhibitors of tyrosine kinases. both the inhibitors significantly inhibited  pge2 production. herbimycin a treatment depressed expression of cox-2 protein. these data suggest that human gingival fibroblasts stimulated with lps from periodontopathogenic bacteria mainly produce pge2 not by cox-1, but by cox-2, induction of which may be regulated by tyrosine kinase and that the produced pge2 may be involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.

AB  == in this study, evidence is presented that mixed infection with the periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans results in a synergistic effect in their pathogenicity and in their ability to induce humoral and cellular host responses. balb/c mice were injected subcutaneously on the back with p. gingivalis atcc 53977, a. actinomycetemocomitans 75 or a mixture of both bacteria. samples of blood and fluid from abscesses formed at the site of injection (first degree) or distant from the injection site were collected for microbiologic analysis. serum and spleens were obtained for evaluation of humoral and cellular responses to p. gingivalis and a actinomycetemocomitans. mice injected with a. actinomycetemcomitans had first-degree lesions only, whereas mice injected with p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans had lesions at first- and second-degree sites from which both bacterial species were isolated. a serum anti-p. gingivalis response was induced in p. gingivalis-injected mice, which was higher in mice injected with p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. this pattern was not seen in the anti-a, actinomycetemcomitans response. lymphoproliferative responses to phytohemagglutinin, escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide and p. gingivalis of spleen cells from infected mice were decreased, especially following co-infection. furthermore, co-infection of mice resulted in the greatest decrease in the number of cd5+, especially cd4+ lymphocytes.

AB  == this study was performed to characterize the antigen(s) recognized by a panel of  monoclonal antibodies (mabs) produced to be specific for porphyromonas gingivalis whole cells which we had previously shown to bind to epitopes recognized by sera  from periodontitis patients. preliminary data had suggested that the arginine-specific proteases of p. gingivalis (argi, argia, and argib) contained the antigenic determinants of four of these antibodies (mabs 1a1, 2b/h9, 7d5, and 3b1). the location of the binding sites was examined with purified p. gingivalis  enzymes and recombinant regions of the argi polyprotein expressed by subclones of the prpr1 gene in escherichia coli xl-1 blue cells. all four antibodies were reactive with protein determinants within the beta subunit, a hemagglutinin and/or adhesin component, of the argi dimer. mab 1a1 strongly inhibited the agglutination of human erythrocytes by p. gingivalis w50 culture supernatant, suggesting that the binding site for this antibody contains residues which are critical for the interaction with the erythrocyte surface. the determinant for mab 1a1 was examined further by construction of a set of truncated forms of the beta component expressed as fusion proteins with glutathione s-transferase at the n terminus. analysis of these constructs mapped the binding site for mab 1a1 to prpri residues g-907 to t-931, gvspkvckdv tvegsnefap vqnlt. western blot (immunoblot) analysis of p. gingivalis whole-cell proteins demonstrated that mab  1a1 reacts with several proteins in the mr range of 20,000 to 120,000. furthermore, an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the coding sequence for the region of the argi beta component containing the mab 1a1 binding site hybridized to multiple bands on genomic digests of p. gingivalis dna. these data  indicate that the mab 1a1 epitope may be a component of a binding domain common to multiple gene products of this organism and may thus represent a functionally  important target of the host's specific immune response to p. gingivalis in periodontal disease.

TI  == genetic evidence for the relationship of porphyromonas gingivalis cysteine protease and hemagglutinin activities.
AB  == cysteine protease and hemagglutinin activities of porphyromonas gingivalis have been implicated as virulence factors in periodontitis. in addition, a close structural relationship between these factors has been suggested. in order to examine the molecular basis for such a relationship, we constructed an isogenic mutant, g-102, of p. gingivalis 381 deficient in arg-gingipain cysteine protease  activity. the mutant displayed not only reduced protease activity but also significantly reduced hemagglutination activity compared with the wild-type strain. therefore, this investigation provided genetic evidence for the recently  proposed structural relationship between arg-gingipain and the hemagglutinin activity of p. gingivalis strains.

TI  == the role of endotoxin and cytokines in the pathogenesis of odontogenic cysts.
AB  == odontogenic cysts arise from tooth-forming epithelial residues. the stimulus for  the formation of radicular cysts is thought to be endotoxin released from the infected necrotic tooth pulp. however, in keratocysts and follicular cysts, such  a stimulus is not present. in order to investigate what drives the cyst epithelium to proliferate, explant media and fluids from 16 radicular cysts, eight keratocysts and seven follicular cysts and explant media from four specimens of non-inflamed gingival tissue were examined for the presence of endotoxin and cytokines. cyst fluids were also cultured for 72 h in anaerobic and aerobic conditions to detect micro-organisms. endotoxin from three different bacteria, cytokines [interleukin-(il) 1 alpha, il-1 beta and il-6] as well as prostaglandin e2 (pge2) were tested in an epithelial cell-proliferation assay. as the cyst epithelium is supported by a connective tissue capsule, the effect of fibroblast culture media on epithelial cell proliferation was also investigated.  the results showed significantly higher concentrations of endotoxin in radicular  cyst fluid than in the keratocyst or the follicular cyst. none of the cyst fluids contained micro-organisms. immunoassays demonstrated the presence of il-1 alpha and -6 in all fluids and explants tested; il-1 beta was only found in the inflammatory radicular cysts. however, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction showed that mrnas for il-1 alpha, -1 beta and -6 were present in all cyst types. proliferation studies indicated that endotoxin and the cytokines had  a mitogenic effect on epithelia at low concentrations; pge2 had very little effect at low concentrations, and had an inhibitory effect at high concentrations. cyst fibroblast culture media had a mitogenic effect on the epithelia that was enhanced by the presence of endotoxin.

TI  == resistance of the normal human microflora to mercury and antimicrobials after exposure to mercury from dental amalgam fillings.
AB  == the concentrations of mercury in saliva and feces and the resistance pattern of the gastrointestinal microflora were investigated for 20 subjects. ten patients,  with a mean number of 19 amalgam surfaces, had all amalgam fillings removed during one dental session. ten subjects without amalgam fillings served as a control group. saliva and fecal samples were collected before amalgam removal and 2, 7, 14, and 60 days afterward. mercury levels in saliva and feces correlated significantly with the number of amalgam surfaces. no differences in the resistance pattern of the oral microflora were detected between the two groups. in the amalgam group there was an increase in the relative number of intestinal microorganisms resistant to mercury, ampicillin, cefoxitin, erythromycin, and clindamycin on days 7-14. this was not statistically significant in light of the  normal variations of the control group. a significant correlation between the prevalence of mercury resistance and multiple antimicrobial resistance in intestinal bacterial strains was observed.

TI  == lipopolysaccharides from porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans promote osteoclastic differentiation in vitro.
AB  == bacterial lipopolysaccharides possess bone-resorbing activity. here, lipopolysaccharides from three putative periodontopathic bacteria were examined for effects on osteoclast-like cell formation of bone marrow cells from lipopolysaccharide-responsive c3h-hen and non-responsive c3h/hej mice. the bone marrow cells were cultured with or without various doses of lipopolysaccharide in the presence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 and dexamethasone. these lipopolysaccharide preparations significantly increased the number of osteoclast-like cells formed in the culture of c3h/hen marrow cells; the same as  lipopolysaccharides from escherichia coli and a synthetic lipid a with e. coli-type structure (la-15-pp), at doses from 0.1 to 1 microgram/ml. this stimulating effect of each lipopolysaccharides was uniformly abrogated by the addition of polymyxin b at 5 micrograms/ml. all the lipopolysaccharide and the synthetic lipid a had no effect on osteoclast formation of the c3h/hej marrow cells, whereas lipopolysaccharide from porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia showed significant mitogenic activity on c3h/hej spleen cells. it seems likely that the activity of lipopolysaccharides to augment osteoclast-like  cell formation in the bone marrow cell cultures is derived from a common structure of the lipid a portion.

TI  == differential induction of il-1 beta and il-6 production by the nontoxic lipid a from porphyromonas gingivalis in comparison with synthetic escherichia coli lipid a in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis 381 lipid a possesses 1-phospho beta(1-6)-linked glucosamine disaccharide with 3-hydroxy-15-methylhexadecanoyl and 3-hexadecanoyloxy-15-methylhexadecanoyl groups at the 2- and 2'-positions, respectively. p. gingivalis lipid a indicated lower activities in inducing interleukin-1 beta (il-1 beta) mrna expression, pro-il-1 beta protein synthesis and il-1 beta production than those of synthetic escherichia coli lipid a (compound 506) in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc). the induction  of il-6 mrna and il-6 synthesis by p. gingivalis lipid a were comparable to those of compound 506. herbimycin a, h-7 and h-8, inhibitors of tyrosine kinase, protein kinase c and cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase, inhibited p. gingivalis lipid a- and compound 506-induced il-1 beta and il-6 synthesis. w-7, an inhibitor of calmodulin (cam) kinase, inhibited only p. gingivalis lipid a-induced il-1 beta production. the result suggests that the cam kinase-dependent cascade is involved in the down-regulation of il-1 beta production by p. gingivalis lipid a. p. gingivalis lipid a and compound 506 also functioned in the induction of tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphorylation of several proteins in pbmc. p. gingivalis lipid a inhibited specific binding of fluorescein-labelled e. coli lps to the pbmc. the nontoxic lipid a of p. gingivalis, having a chemical structure different from toxic compound 506, appears to induce the up- and down-regulation of the differential cytokine-producing activities following the activation of various intracellular enzymes including the cam kinase through the  common receptor sites of lps.

TI  == the effect of oral commensal bacteria on candidal adhesion to denture acrylic surfaces. an in vitro study.
AB  == the effect of four different species of oral bacteria (streptococci (x 2); escherichia; porphyromonas) on the adhesion of candida albicans and candida krusei to denture acrylic surfaces was studied using a previously described in vitro adhesion assay. clear acrylic strips immersed in known concentrations of bacterial suspensions and incubated for 45 min to 1 h, at 37 degrees c, were transferred to yeast suspensions of known concentrations and incubated for a similar period, and the adherent yeasts were quantified using an image analysis system. pre-exposure to different bacterial concentrations resulted in suppression of candidal adhesion to varying degrees. of three selected concentrations, exposure to the highest bacterial concentration (10(6) organisms/ml) resulted in a consistent reduction in candidal adhesion, except for e. coli-c. albicans and s. salivarius-c. albicans combinations. candidal adhesion was significantly reduced on pre-exposure to s. sanguis and p. gingivalis, but not e. coli. there were also significant differences in relative adhesion between c. albicans and c. krusei. taken together, these results indicate that the adhesion of yeasts to acrylic strips is modulated both by the quantity and the quality of pre-existing bacterial flora on acrylic surfaces.

TI  == novel fnr homologues identified in four representative oral facultative anaerobes: capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, haemophilus aphrophilus, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == based upon dna sequence data and positive immunochemical reactivity of expressed  protein, novel homologues of the fnr family were identified in four representative oral facultative anaerobes: capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, haemophilus aphrophilus, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the similarity to e. coli fnr and to hlyx (itself 71% similar to e. coli fnr, while regulating expression of hemolysin operon in actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae) was estimated from the deduced partial amino acid sequence to be, in the above order of tested species, 98, 98, 86, and 85%, and 75, 75, 88, and 88%, respectively. the phylogenetic relatedness indicates a rather closer link of hlyx to the fnr homologues from both pathogens, h. aphrophilus and a. actinomycetemcomitans. the possibility that the a. actinomycetemcomitans fnr homologue functions as a redox-sensing transcriptional  factor to regulate, in addition to anaerobic respiration, microaerobic expression of the leukotoxin operon (ltx gene) is suggested.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and treponema denticola detection in oral plaque samples using the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == detection of putative pathogens is critical for delineating the etiology and progression of periodontitis. in the present study, we have used a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay utilizing primers specific for the lkt a gene of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, the fimbrial gene of porphyromonas gingivalis, and tdp a gene of treponema denticola in order to determine the presence of these pathogens in subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis sites. these gene specific primers were also used to assess the detection of different strains of bacteria in the pcr assays. primers for p. gingivalis detected p. gingivalis strain 33277, but no product was detected when primers were used with extracts from 4 species of capnocytophaga, 3 species of prevotella, 2 species of porphyromonas other than p. gingivalis, bacteroides levii, escherichia coli, 3 strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans and 3 strains of t. denticola. pcr analysis using primers for the lkt a gene of a. actinomycetemcomitans also did not result in a product with any of these bacteria with the exception of a positive result with 3 different strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans. primers selected from the tdp a gene of t. denticola did not identify any of the bacteria strains tested except t. denticola serovars a, b, and c. thus, these primers were shown to amplify gene segments that are specific to either p. gingivalis (33277), a. actinomycetemcomitans (33384, 43717  and 43718) or t. denticola (35405, 33521 and 35404). the pcr assay may be used to rapidly detect the presence of periodontal pathogens in the future.

TI  == comparison of the pro-inflammatory cytokine-stimulating activity of the surface-associated proteins of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == saline extraction of the periodontopathic bacterium, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, releases surface-associated material (sam), a complex mixture of proteins and carbohydrates with potent biological actions on isolated  bone and on various mammalian cell populations. in this study, the relative ability of the sam from 5 organisms, implicated in the pathology of periodontal disease, to stimulate human mesenchymal and myelomonocytic cells to synthesize the proinflammatory cytokines - interleukin (il)-1 beta, il-6 and tumour necrosis factor (tnf)alpha has been investigated. the bacteria investigated were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and campylobacter rectus. human cells were exposed to a four log order range of concentrations of the sam, or of escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, to provide full agonist dose responses in order to allow comparison of the potency and efficacy of each sam. all sams demonstrated the capacity to stimulate human gingival fibroblasts (hgfs), human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) or the myelomonocytic cell line - mono-mac-6 to release one or all of the cytokines assayed. activity was heat- and trypsin-sensitive suggesting that the active components were proteinaceous. however, there were substantial differences in the potency and efficacy of each sam when compared on  a concentration basis (w/v). the most active sam was from a. actinomycetemcomitans with those from e. corrodens and p. gingivalis being slightly less active. the least active cytokine-stimulating sams were from c. rectus and pr. intermedia. one major difference between the sams and e. coli lps  was the inability of the former to stimulate hgfs to release il-1 beta or tnf alpha although they could stimulate pbmcs to release these cytokines. this may have relevance to the pathology of the periodontal diseases.

TI  == lipopolysaccharide increases cell surface-associated fibronectin in fibroblasts in vitro.
AB  == this study assessed the fibronectin expression by fibroblasts derived from noninflamed and inflamed gingiva by measuring the amount of cell surface-associated fibronectin and fibronectin released into the medium. the effects of added lipopolysaccharide from porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens and escherichia coli on both types of fibroblasts were also studied. in the absence of lipopolysaccharide, the amounts of the two types of fibronectin were significantly larger in the fibroblasts from inflamed than from noninflamed  gingiva. the specific lipopolysaccharide had no effect on the amount of fibronectin released into the medium by either fibroblast type. the amount of cell surface-associated fibronectin increased significantly when lipopolysaccharide (0.1 and 1 microgram/ml) was added to the cells from the noninflamed gingiva (the effect was evident in the order: p. gingivalis>p.nigrescens>e. coli). lipopolysaccharide from p. gingivalis significantly increased the cell surface-associated fibronectin even at a low concentration of lipopolysaccharide (0.01 microgram/ml). in fibroblasts from the  inflamed gingiva, only the lipopolysaccharide from p. gingivalis was effective in increasing the amount of cell surface-associated fibronectin. our findings showed that the fibronectin expression was increased in the fibroblasts from inflamed gingiva and that lipopolysaccharide from p. gingivalis increased the cell surface-associated fibronectin.

AB  == the downstream dna region of the fimbrilin gene (fima), which encodes the major subunit protein of porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae, was fully sequenced. gene products, expressed from this region in escherichia coli, were purified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and their partial amino acid  sequences were determined to verify open reading frames (orfs) found in the region by dna sequencing. four orfs, designated orf1, orf2, orf3 and orf4, were found in the 5.8-kb psti fragment downstream from fima, which was previously cloned and partially characterized by yoshimura, takahashi, hibi, takasawa, kato, and dickinson (infect. immun. 61: 5181-5189, 1993). the direction of transcription of all the orfs was the same as that of fima. the 50 and 80 kda encoded proteins, orf2 and orf3, respectively, have been reported to be minor components associated with fimbriae. the 15 and 19 kda proteins, orf1 and orf4, respectively, have been expressed in e. coli but not identified in p. gingivalis. however, all the gene products of the orfs, expressed in e. coli, appeared to contain intact signal peptides based on their n-terminal amino acid sequences.

AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the survival in vmga iii of porphyromonas  gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and enteric rods in laboratory cultures as well as in subgingival plaque samples. laboratory strains of the 4 putative periodontal pathogens and escherichia coli were used in the laboratory part of this study. also, 31 subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 22 periodontal patients and stored in vmga iii. each sample, from both the laboratory and the clinical parts, was divided into 3 portions. one portion was cultured within a few hours of collection (baseline), while the second was processed after 24 h (day 2) and the third 48 h later (day 3). the results of the clinical part indicate that the  detection frequencies of all 4 periodontal pathogens and their levels in positive samples decreased, to different degrees, by day 2 and decreased further by day 3. enteric rods were not detected in base line samples. however, they were present in 16.1% and 22.6% of day 2 and day 3 samples, respectively. similarly, the laboratory results demonstrate a significant decrease in the levels of the 4 periodontal pathogens tested by day 2 and day 3, whereas the opposite occurred for e. coli. p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and f. nucleatum survived better in the presence of e. coli than alone, whereas a. actinomycetemcomitans survived less well when co-inoculated with e. coli. vmga iii appears to maintain microbial population ratios for periods up to 24 h. after 24 h, the multiplication of enteric organisms may alter the original proportions of the sample.

TI  == characterization, genetic analysis, and expression of a protease antigen (prpri)  of porphyromonas gingivalis w50.
AB  == previous studies of the serum immunoglobulin g antibody response of periodontal patients have demonstrated significant reactivity to a cell surface or extracellular arginine-specific protease of porphyromonas gingivalis which migrates as an approximately 50-kda band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. in the present report, two forms of the enzyme (argi and argia) with this electrophoretic behavior were isolated. argi is a heterodimer of alpha and beta subunits, and argia is a monomer composed of the catalytically active alpha component alone. the gene encoding argi (prpr1 encoding protease polyprotein argi) was cloned from sau3ai digests of p. gingivalis w50 dna into puc18. sequence analysis demonstrated that the alpha and beta components are contiguous  on the initial translation product and are flanked by large n- and c-terminal extensions. prpr1 is 97.5% identical to the rgp-1 gene from p. gingivalis h66. prpr1 expression in escherichia coli demonstrated the presence of an internal transcription-translation initiation site which could permit independent expression of different regions of the polyprotein. immunochemical analysis of p. gingivalis mid-logarithmic-phase cultures suggested that the processing of prpri  may be closely coupled to its synthesis, with only the final stages taking place  at the cell surface. southern hybridization studies demonstrated that the prpr1 gene is widely distributed in other p. gingivalis strains and that a second homologous locus to the alpha component and at least two other homologous loci to the beta component are present on the p. gingivalis chromosome. these data indicate that the argi protease of p. gingivalis is a member of a family of sequence-related gene products which may share both functional and antigenic properties.

TI  == impact of polyunsaturated fatty acids on human colonic bacterial metabolism: an in vitro and in vivo study.
AB  == dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa) reduce colonic proliferation and exert a mild laxative effect. we have studied the effect of the highly unsaturated eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester (epa-ee) on the growth and metabolism of colonic bacteria in vitro, and in vivo. for the in vitro study, growth was assessed by viable counts. bacteroides thetaiotaomicron was significantly inhibited in anaerobic media containing epa-ee at concentrations > 7 milligrams.  escherichia coli was apparently resistant even at 100 milligrams. for the in vivo study, ten healthy volunteers ingested 18 g epa-ee/d for 7 d. stool frequency, 24 h stool weight and whole-gut transit time were assessed together with breath h2 and 14co2 excretion following oral ingestion of 15 g lactitol labelled with 0.18  mbq [14c]lactitol. the area under the breath-h2-time curve was significantly reduced by epa-ee, from a control value of 690.3 (se 94.2) ppm.h to 449.5 (se 91.7) ppm.h. percentage dose of 14co2 excreted, total stool weight and whole-gut  transit time were unaltered, being respectively 24 (se 2)%, 281 (se 66) g and 45  (se 4) h with epa-ee v. control values of 27 (se 1)%, 300 (se 89) g and 42 (se 5) h. it is concluded that dietary supplementation with epa-ee reduces breath h2 excretion without apparently impairing overall colonic carbohydrate fermentation. the observed reduction may reflect utilization of h2 to hydrogenate the five double bonds of epa-ee.

TI  == the cloning, expression and sequence analysis of a second porphyromonas gingivalis gene that codes for a protein involved in hemagglutination.
AB  == it has been suggested that porphyromonas gingivalis may possess more than one hemagglutinin. we have previously reported the cloning of a gene (haga) that encodes a hemagglutinin. in this study we report the cloning, characterization, and sequencing of a second gene (hagb) that encodes a protein that also appears to be involved in hemagglutination. antiserum to the clone (st 7) was found to inhibit hemagglutination by p. gingivalis 381, and hemagglutinating inhibition activity of anti-p. gingivalis antiserum was reduced by adsorption of the antiserum with cells of clone st 7. restriction mapping and southern analysis indicates there is little or no dna homology between this cloned 4.8-kb hindiii dna fragment and a cloned hemagglutinin gene we have previously described. minicell analysis of the cloned p. gingivalis chromosomal dna fragment revealed that the major gene product is a 49-kda protein. immunoaffinity chromatography using purified rabbit immunoglobulin g against the cloned protein resulted in the purification of a major reactive 49- to 50-kda protein from a p. gingivalis cell  lysate. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed the hagb open reading frame to be 1053 nucleotides in length with a mol% g+c of 59.9% coding for a protein of 350 residues with a calculated molecular weight of 39.375 kda. this protein was also  determined to be basic and hydrophilic and to contain a potential signal peptide. comparison of both the nucleotide and derived amino acid sequences with computer-based databases did not reveal any significant homologies between habb and any other previously sequenced genes.

AB  == study objective: to compare the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic activity of three drug regimens: cefotaxime plus metronidazole, cefoxitin, and ampicillin-sulbactam against two organisms frequently isolated in intraabdominal  infection, escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis. design: open-label, three-way crossover study. setting: hartford hospital clinical research center. participants: nine healthy volunteers. interventions: subjects received the following regimens: (1) a single 1-g intravenous dose of cefotaxime plus a single 500-mg oral dose of metronidazole; (2) two intravenous doses of cefoxitin, 2 g each dose given every 6 hours; and (3) two intravenous doses of ampicillin-sulbactam, 3 g each dose given every 6 hours. measurements and main results: serum bactericidal titers and drug concentrations were measured over a 12-hour period. the cefotaxime-metronidazole regimen showed superior activity against e. coli compared with ampicillin-sulbactam and cefoxitin. the mean areas  under the bactericidal activity curve (aubc) for the three regimens were 550.2, 68.7, and 48.9, respectively (p = 0.0001). there was no significant difference in aubc among the three regimens for b. fragilis. serum concentrations of cefotaxime remained above the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) for e. coli significantly longer than did concentrations of ampicillin-sulbactam and cefoxitin (p = 0.0002 and p = 0.0023, respectively). serum concentrations of metronidazole were still at 9 times the mic for b. fragilis at the end of the 12-hour dosing interval; for ampicillin-sulbactam and cefoxitin concentrations remained above the mic for one-half and less than one-fourth, respectively, of the dosing interval (p < 0.0001). the ratio of auc:mic was also favorable for metronidazole (212.2) compared with 63.4 for ampicillin-sulbactam and 9.2 for cefoxitin. conclusions: the combination of cefotaxime-metronidazole, even at the  relatively low doses used in this study, provides coverage against gram-negative  and anaerobic pathogens that is at least as effective as that of cefoxitin and ampicillin-sulbactam. in addition, its cost is considerably less expensive than that of the other regimens.

TI  == a peptide, altte, within the fimbrial subunit protein from porphyromonas gingivalis, induces production of interleukin 6, gene expression and protein phosphorylation in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis 381 fimbriae and a synthetic peptide composed of residues 69-73 (altte) of the fimbrial subunit protein, fp381(69-73), function in the induction of interleukin 6 (il-6) production, il-6 mrna expression, and tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphorylation of several proteins in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc). herbimycin a and h-7, inhibitors of tyrosine kinases and protein kinase c (pkc), markedly inhibited il-6 production,  gene expression, and tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphorylation of proteins. an inactive analog of synthetic peptide replaced alanine to glycine at position 69 in fp381(69-73), gltte, exhibited an antagonistic effect on the il-6 production induced by the fimbriae. these results suggest that the peptide altte  functions as an agent in inflammatory reactions and immune responses in the inflamed gingival and periodontal tissues, in which the participation of protein  phosphorylation by tyrosine kinases and pkc in signal transduction may be considered.

TI  == molecular and immunological characterization of a 64-kda protein of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == the 64-kda protein to which about half the sera from patients with localized juvenile periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis reacted strongly was purified from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4. determination of the n-terminal sequence of the protein revealed that it was a groel-like protein. the dna fragment containing the groel gene of a. actinomycetemcomitans was amplified  by polymerase chain reaction, and the groesl operon was cloned by using colony hybridization with the amplified fragment from a. actinomycetemcomitans chromosomal dna. sequence analysis revealed that structures of the operon and its products were typical in gram-negative bacteria. rabbit polyclonal antibodies to  the 64-kda protein cross-reacted with approximately 65-kda proteins of haemophilus aphrophilus, haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus paraphrophilus, escherichia coli and eikenella corrodens but not with any cellular proteins of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum. it is possible that antibodies reactive to the 64-kda protein in periodontitis patients are induced by the cross-reactivity with the hsp60 proteins of other bacteria.

TI  == differential expression of il-1 beta, tnf-alpha, il-6, and il-8 in human monocytes in response to lipopolysaccharides from different microbes.
AB  == macrophages respond to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (lps) and activate several host defense functions through production of mediators. however, it is not clear  whether the degree of macrophage responsiveness to different sources of lps is equivalent to or varies with the source of lps. therefore, in this report, we examined the extent of the human monocyte response to lps derived from two oral pathogens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa) and porphyromonas gingivalis (pg). additionally, due to its well-established ability to activate monocytes, we used lps from escherichia coli (ec). human monocytes, when activated with a specific source of lps, exhibited rapid expression of mrna for il-1 beta, tnf-alpha, and il-8, which was followed by il-6, as measured by rna-pcr. moreover, the expression of mrna for these cytokines was followed by cytokine synthesis. monocytes from the same subject, when activated with lps from pg, aa,  or ec expressed quantitatively different levels of mrna and proteins for all four cytokines. a given lps induced either high or low expression of the battery of cytokines tested, indicating that the expression of these pro-inflammatory cytokines may be regulated by a single or a cluster of gene(s). however, no apparent differences in the time course of mrna expression for these cytokines were observed in response to any of the lps tested. furthermore, the relative ability of the different sources of lps to induce mrna for cytokines varied throughout a wide range of lps concentrations. this suggests that differences exist in the sensitivity of monocytes to a specific lps, rather than in the kinetics of the secretory process itself.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == effects of lipopolysaccharides on human dental pulp cells.
AB  == human dental pulp cells were treated with 1, 10, and 100 micrograms/ml of lipopolysaccharide (lps). the effects of treatment were examined by measurement of the dna content, protein content, and alkaline phosphatase activity of the cells. lps samples were purified from porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum isolated from root canals, and escherichia coli 0111:b4 lps was used as a positive control. at a concentration of 1 microgram/ml, none of the lpss caused any change in the production of dna or protein, whereas the amount of dna was increased at 10 micrograms/ml and inhibited at 100 micrograms/ml. protein synthesis was decreased by lpss at both 10 and 100 micrograms/ml. alkaline phosphatase activity was not changed at any concentration of lps tested.

TI  == endotoxin affinity for provisional restorative resins.
AB  == purpose: this study compared the relative affinity of porphyromonas gingivalis and escherichia coli endotoxin, bacterial cell envelope lipopolysaccharide (lps), for three provisional resins. materials and methods: as-polymerized and pumiced polymethyl methacrylate and polyethyl methacrylate resin discs were exposed to 1,000 endotoxin u/ml p. gingivalis or e. coli lps in water for 24 hours at 37 degrees c, whereas control discs were placed in lps-free water. lps-treated discs were transferred at 24-hour intervals to fresh, lps-free water for up to 96 hours, and the incubated eluates were tested for the presence of lps. results: initial adherence of p. gingivalis lps to as-polymerized and pumiced-finish resin was a function of resin type, but surface characteristics modified adherence levels. when steady rates of elution were reached at 72 to 96 hours, as-polymerized specimens released significantly greater lps levels than pumiced samples. comparison of initial adherence of p. gingivalis and e. coli lps with pumiced resins showed that adherence was based on a combination of lps and resin  type. p. gingivalis lps had a greater relative affinity for polyethyl methacrylate, and e. coli lps has a greater relative affinity for polymethyl methacrylate. regardless of resin type, p. gingivalis lps eluted at levels greater than e. coli lps. conclusions: the affinity of lps for provisional resins seems to be a function of selective interactions based on the chemical nature of  the resin, the surface finish of the resin, and the molecular structure of the lps.

TI  == effects of cytokines and periodontopathic bacteria on the leukocyte function-associated antigen 1/intercellular adhesion molecule 1 pathway in gingival fibroblasts in adult periodontitis.
AB  == we investigated the effects of inflammatory cytokines and periodontopathic bacteria on expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (icam-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, and e-selectin (endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1) in cultured human gingival fibroblasts (hgf). cell surface icam-1 was upregulated on hgf under transcriptional control by exposure not only to interleukin-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and gamma interferon but also to sonic extracts prepared from porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia (nigrescens) and lipopolysaccharides from escherichia coli. however, these stimuli induced only minimal expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and  e-selectin on hgf. binding assays using hgf and molt 4, the human t-cell leukemia cell line, showed induced icam-1 to be functional, and the increased binding was  blocked by a combination of monoclonal antibodies against icam-1 and leukocyte function-associated antigen 1. furthermore, gingival tissues from adult periodontitis patients showed increased mrna expression of icam-1 compared with that in tissues from normal healthy donors. in immunohistological analysis, we also observed in vivo that the expression of icam-1 on fibroblasts in adult periodontitis tissues was greater than that in normal gingiva. thus, the overexpression of icam-1 on gingival fibroblasts induced by cytokines and periodontopathic bacteria is speculated to be deeply involved in the accumulation and retention of leukocyte function-associated antigen 1-bearing leukocytes in adult periodontitis lesions.

TI  == characterisation of is1126 from porphyromonas gingivalis w83: a new member of the is4 family of insertion sequence elements.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of is1126, the only insertion sequence so far isolated from the oral pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis, has been determined. it had a nucleotide sequence of 1338 base pair (bp) flanked by 12 bp perfect inverted repeats and generated a 5 bp target site duplication. the single major open reading frame encoded a predicted protein of 361 amino acids and molecular mass of 41 kda. the gene encoding the transposase was subcloned into puc18 and the transposase expressed in escherichia coli minicells. the predicted amino acid sequence of the transposase had homology to putative transposases of is1106 and is1186 both of which belong to the is5 group within the is4 super-family of insertion elements. on the basis of this homology we propose that is1126 should also be included in the is5 group. southern-blot analysis of a number of p. gingivalis strains using is1126 as a probe revealed a unique pattern of hybridisation for each strain and the absence of is1126 from other closely related porphyromonas species. this should allow is1126 to be used as a rapid epidemiological tool in studying oral infections by p. gingivalis.

TI  == transmission of oral prevotella melaninogenica between a mother and her young child.
AB  == most likely, young children acquire their oral microflora by frequent transfer of bacteria between family members. the possible transmission of obligately anaerobic prevotella melaninogenica recovered from 11 mother-child pairs was examined by ribotyping. one to 18 isolates (mean 13) per child from different oral sampling sites and 4 to 17 (mean 10) isolates per mother from stimulated salivary samples, collected on 2 occasions, were analyzed. on sampling, the mean  ages of the children were 4 months and 32 months, respectively. restriction endonucleases kpni and clai were chosen for the digestion of chromosomal dna. dna fragments were electrophoretically separated, blotted onto a nylon membrane and hybridized with rrna operon of escherichia coli. dna-dna hybrids were detected immunologically. extensive genetic heterogeneity, 101 distinct ribotypes, was observed among 248 p. melaninogenica isolates studied. both mothers and children  harbored several (up to 7) ribotypes which, apart from 3 ribotypes, were distinguishable in unrelated subjects. several p. melaninogenica ribotypes were detected on both sampling occasions over 2 years apart. identical ribotypes were  found in 6 of the 11 mother-child pairs, 1 to 2 similar ribotypes per pair. this  suggests the transmission of p. melaninogenica between the mother and her child,  probably via maternal saliva. however, the unique ribotypes found in these children also indicate that other sources besides the mother influence the oral colonization of young children.

TI  == hemagglutinating and chemotactic properties of synthetic peptide segments of fimbrial protein from porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis 381 fimbriae, their synthetic peptide segments, and lipopolysaccharide (lps) were examined for hemagglutinating and migration-stimulating activities. p. gingivalis 381 fimbriae clearly caused hemagglutination, and several oligopeptide segments such as fp381(61-80), fp381(171-185), and fp381(302-321), corresponding to the amino acid residue numbers based on the amino acid sequence of fimbrillin proposed by dickinson et al. (d. p. dickinson, m. a. kubiniec, f. yoshimura, and r. j. genco, j. bacteriol. 170:1658-1665, 1988), were also demonstrated to agglutinate erythrocytes although less effectively than the native fimbriae. furthermore, p.  gingivalis 381 lps but not escherichia coli o55:b5 lps definitely exhibited hemagglutination. p. gingivalis fimbriae as well as their synthetic peptides possessing hemagglutinating activity enhanced the chemotaxically induced migration of human peripheral blood monocytes. the results of the analyses using  synthetic peptide fp381(61-80), its related compounds, and an analog suggested that the amino acid sequence xltxxltxxnxx within fimbrial protein molecules may play an important role structurally in the attachment of the protein to host cells such as erythrocytes and monocytes.

AB  == an insertion sequence-like element, is1139, was cloned and sequenced from streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975 chromosome. this insertion sequence-like element is 1168 bp long and is delimited by inverted repeats of 29 bp and by a duplicated sequence of 6 bp. this is possesses an open reading frame that codes for a putative transposase of 339 amino acids which has, respectively, 94, 35, 33, and 30% amino-acid identity with the transposases of is1161 from s. salivarius atcc 25975, is4351 from bacteroides fragilis, is30 from escherichia coli, and is1086 from alcaligenes eutrophus. sequence analysis revealed that these transposases may have evolved from a common ancestral gene. southern hybridization of restriction endonuclease-digested genomic dna from 21 strains of oral streptococci, using a probe specific to the transposase-encoding gene (tnpa), revealed that is1139 is found in two strains of s. salivarius, atcc 25975 and atcc 13419, in eight and two copies, respectively.

AB  == the heat shock response of porphyromonas gingivalis was examined by 1- and 2-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after metabolic labeling with [14c]-amino acids. when p. gingivalis cells were shifted from 37 degrees c to 42  degrees c, elevated synthesis of 4 proteins with the apparent molecular weight of 92, 80, 74, and 62 kda was observed, and synthesis of a 50-kda protein decreased  during heat shock. the 74- and 62-kda proteins were identified as homologs of escherichia coli dnak and groel respectively by western immunoblotting. on 2-dimensional western blots, 2 forms of dnak and 4 forms of groel were identified due to their slightly different isolelectric points. dnak and groel gene homologs were identified in several p. gingivalis strains and some other black-pigmented oral species. dnak and groel homolog proteins were induced when p. gingivalis cells were challenged by ethanol. these proteins were not induced by oxidative stress or change in ph.

TI  == construction and characterization of a fima mutant of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == although fimbriae of porphyromonas gingivalis have been implicated as playing a major role in adherence to gingival tissue surfaces, no conclusive genetic evidence has yet been obtained. the fima gene, the determinant for the major fimbrial subunit protein, was cloned and sequenced (d. p. dickinson, m. a. kubiniec, f. yoshimura, and r. j. genco, j. bacteriol. 170:1658-1665, 1988). we undertook to inactivate the fima gene by a homologous recombination technique and examined the fima mutant for changes in surface properties, including production  of fimbriae, adherence to human gingival fibroblasts and epithelial cells, hemagglutinating activity, and surface hydrophobicity. to inactivate the fima gene, we disrupted a fima clone by insertion of a dna segment containing an erythromycin resistance (emr) gene. this was then delivered into p. gingivalis atcc 33277 from an escherichia coli k-12 strain, sm10 lambda pir, by using a mobilizable suicide vector, pgp704; recombination at the fima locus led to the isolation of a fima mutant. disruption of the fima locus and disappearance of fima production were confirmed by southern hybridization with a fima-specific dna probe and western immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody against the fima protein, respectively. the fima mutant constructed failed to express long (0.5- to 1.0-micron) fimbriae from the bacterial surface and had a diminished adhesive  capacity to tissue-cultured human gingival fibroblasts and epithelial cells. observation of the bacteria adhering to human gingival fibroblasts by scanning electron microscopy revealed that the wild-type strain had dramatic local changes in the appearance of the microvilli at the point of contact with large bacterial  clumps, whereas the fima mutant did not. in contrast, neither the hemagglutinating activity nor the surface hydrophobicity was changed in the fima  mutant. these data thus constitute the first direct genetic evidence demonstrating that the fima protein of p. gingivalis is essential for the interaction of the organism with human gingival tissue cells through a function(s) encoded by the fima gene.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide stimulation of human monocytes: dependence on serum and cd14 receptor.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate factors influencing the ability of lipopolysaccharide (lps) derived from porphyromonas gingivalis to elicit secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf alpha) from human monocytes (adherent mononuclear cells). the results indicate that p. gingivalis lps stimulation of tnf alpha from monocytes is comparable to lps from escherichia coli. both lps, although structurally different, increased tnf alpha secretion in a dose-dependent manner. in serum-free conditions, tnf alpha secretion was relatively low, but it dramatically increased at human serum concentrations as low as 1%. maximal secretion was observed in the presence of 10% serum, with a slight decrease at higher serum concentrations. the cd14 molecule is a putative monocyte lps receptor. when cells were pre-incubated with a blocking monoclonal antibody (my4) to cd14, tnf alpha-mrna accumulation and tnf alpha secretion were  reduced to control levels at lps concentrations of up to 10 ng/ml. at higher lps  concentrations, the blocking effect was only partial, in spite of 50-fold excess  antibody concentration. the blocking effect was observed only in the presence of  serum. the effect of the cd14 antibody was dose-dependent with saturation at 2.5  micrograms/ml. the results suggest that cd14 is one of the major receptors for p. gingivalis lps but highlight the necessity to investigate other cell-surface receptors mediating p. gingivalis-lps interactions. these interactions are believed to be important in the pathogenesis of periodontal destruction.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis invades human pocket epithelium in vitro.
AB  == the present study examined the adhesive and invasive potential of porphyromonas gingivalis interacting with human pocket epithelium in vitro. pocket epithelial tissue, obtained during periodontal surgery of patients with advanced periodontal disease, generated a stratified epithelium in culture. p. gingivalis strains w50  and fdc 381 (laboratory strains), omgs 712, 1439, 1738, 1739 and 1743 (clinical isolates) as well as escherichia coli strain hb101 (non-adhering control) were tested with respect to epithelial adhesion and invasion. adhesion was quantitated by scintillation spectrometry after incubation of radiolabeled bacteria with epithelial cells. the invasive ability of p. gingivalis was measured by means of  an antibiotic protection assay. the epithelial multilayers were infected with the test and control strains and subsequently incubated with an antibiotic mixture (metronidazole 0.1 mg/ml and gentamicin 0.5 mg/ml). the number of internalized bacteria surviving the antibiotic treatment was assessed after plating lyzed epithelial cells on culture media. all tested p. gingivalis strains adhered to and entered pocket epithelial cells. however, considerable variation in their adhesive and invasive potential was observed. e. coli strain hb101 did not adhere or invade. transmission electron microscopy revealed that internalization of p. gingivalis was preceded by formation of microvilli and coated pits on the epithelial cell surfaces. intracellular bacteria were most frequently surrounded  by endosomal membranes; however, bacteria devoid of such membranes were also seen. release of outer membrane vesicles (blebs) by internalized p. gingivalis was observed. these results support and extend previous work from this laboratory which demonstrated invasion of a human oral epithelial cell-line (kb) by p. gingivalis.

TI  == proteins with molecular masses of 50 and 80 kilodaltons encoded by genes downstream from the fimbrilin gene (fima) are components associated with fimbriae in the oral anaerobe porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == flanking dna regions of the fimbrilin gene (designated fima), which encodes the major subunit protein of porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis fimbriae, were cloned in several manners from the p. gingivalis chromosome into escherichia coli by screening with probes derived from a 2.5-kb saci dna fragment previously cloned. a total of 10.4 kb of dna fragments from the p. gingivalis genome was cloned in the puc plasmid. expression of the fima gene and possible flanking genes in the fragments cloned was examined in a puc plasmid vector system and in  a bacteriophage t7 rna polymerase-promoter expression vector system. the results  show that in the puc plasmid system, a 45-kda protein, a product of fima, was only poorly expressed as a precursor of the fimbrilin protein (fima) and could be detected from cell extracts in western blotting (immunoblotting) analysis as a sharp band but not in colony immunoblotting analysis. on the other hand, in the t7 rna polymerase-promoter system, the product of fima and products of the possible flanking genes responsible for fimbriation were overproduced as thick bands of the 45-kda protein and as 63-, 50-, and 80-kda proteins, respectively, in stained electrophoresis gels. all of the recombinant proteins were insoluble and seemed to be expressed as precursors with leader peptides. the 63-kda, 45-k*da (a truncated protein of the 50-kda protein), and 80-kda proteins were purified after solubilization with sodium dodecyl sulfate. n-terminal amino acid  sequences of the 45-k*da and 80-kda proteins were analyzed up to the first 35 residues with a gas-phase sequencer. monospecific antibodies directed to the recombinant proteins, i.e., the 63-kda, 45-k*da, and 80-kda proteins, were raised in rabbits. by using the antibodies, localization of their matured proteins in p. gingivalis was investigated by western blotting analysis. immunoblotting analysis suggests that at least the 50- and 80-kda proteins, encoded by genes downstream from the fima gene, are minor components associated with fimbriae.

AB  == fimbriae have been reported to play an important role in the adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis to oral surfaces and possibly in triggering host responses. a structural subunit of the fimbriae, fimbrillin, has been shown to be important in binding of the bacterium to saliva-coated oral surfaces. in the present study, a coding region of the fimbrillin gene from p. gingivalis 2561 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the pet-11d vector. the recombinant plasmid was transformed into escherichia coli bl21, and protein expression was induced with isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside. the expressed protein was purified from insoluble inclusion bodies after solubilization with urea and gel filtration chromatography. the purified recombinant fimbrillin polypeptide, r-fim 10-337, corresponded to amino acid residues 10 to 337 of the deduced amino acid sequence of fimbrillin. in immunoblot analysis, r-fim 10-337 reacted with antibodies to fimbrillin purified from p. gingivalis, as well as with antibodies to synthetic peptides corresponding to the amino acid sequence of fimbrillin. the apparent molecular mass of r-fim 10-337 was estimated to be 41 kda on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. the r-fim 10-337 polypeptide was capable of inhibiting the binding of p. gingivalis 2561 to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads. these results suggest that the fimbrillin subunit polypeptide plays an important role in binding of p. gingivalis cells to saliva-coated surfaces. we describe here the successful expression and purification of a functionally and immunologically reactive recombinant p. gingivalis fimbrillin subunit from e. coli.

TI  == characterization of recombinant and native forms of a cell surface antigen of porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis.
AB  == the cloning of genes encoding putative cell surface antigens of porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 has been reported previously (b. c. mcbride, a. joe, and u. singh, arch. oral biol. 55:59s-68s, 1990). this study characterizes the recombinant protein rpgag1, which is highly expressed in clone ba3, and the corresponding 51-kda native antigen pgag1. cellular localization studies with monospecific antibodies to rpgag1 in a western immunoblot assay of a p. gingivalis membrane fraction and immunogold labeling of intact p. gingivalis cells confirmed the cell surface location of the native pgag1 molecule. the pgag1 gene was found to be present in all four strains of p. gingivalis examined, and the gene product was expressed. highly homologous dna sequences and immunologically related proteins, however, were not detected in related species in the group formerly known as black-pigmented bacteroides. this suggests that pgag1 is specific to p. gingivalis and is highly conserved within this species. a protein data base search with the nh2-terminal amino acid sequence of rpgag1 did  not identify any significantly similar protein sequences. the high level of expression of rpgag1 was not dependent on the insertional orientation of the cloned fragment. it therefore appears that a p. gingivalis promoter is present which is well recognized by the transcriptional apparatus of the escherichia coli cloning host. the promoter element and structural gene for a specific cell surface antigen of p. gingivalis have been cloned.

TI  == genetic transformation of porphyromonas gingivalis by electroporation.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis was transformed by electroporation using the dna of plasmid pe5-2, or its derivative, pyt7. prior to transformation, pe5-2 was transferred from escherichia coli to p. gingivalis strains by conjugation (mobilization with r751), and the plasmid dna was purified from the p. gingivalis transconjugants. transformation occurred when the recipient strain and the donor  strain from which the plasmid dna was purified were homologous. if they were heterologous, transformation did not take place or did so at a very low frequency. this suggested that a restriction-modification system is present in p. gingivalis strains. plasmid pyt7 was derived by removing an 8.0 kb avai fragment  from pe5-2 that was purified from p. gingivalis cells. it has several single-cutting restriction sites such as ecori, avai and clai usable for gene cloning, though it was not stable enough in p. gingivalis cells, probably because the rep gene was derived from a relatively distant species, bacteroides eggerthii.

TI  == cloning of two distinct hemolysin genes from porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis in escherichia coli.
AB  == hemolysin is considered a potent virulence factor in a large number of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens. the hemolysin produced by the oral pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis functions to provide the cell with its required heme-containing molecules for growth in the periodontal pocket. two distinct p. gingivalis genes, each of which confers a hemolytic phenotype in escherichia coli, were isolated by screening genomic dna libraries of p. gingivalis on sheep blood agar plates. the results obtained from physical maps and southern blots indicated a considerable degree of divergence in the nucleotide sequences of these two genes. maxicell analyses of the recombinant plasmids in e. coli suggested that plasmid ppgh5 encoded a polypeptide of molecular weight 48 kda, while an 18-kda polypeptide was obtained with ppgh1 and  ppgh7. when e. coli harboring these hemolysin genes were subjected to iron starvation, the levels of hemolysin activity increased. biochemical characterization of hemolytic activities indicated that the activity of both hemolysins was inhibited by mg2+ and ca2+; but not by edta. elevated levels of hemolytic activity were obtained from the e. coli recombinant strains in the presence of glutathione, dtt and 2-mercaptoethanol. cholesterol inhibited the activity.

TI  == expression of porphyromonas gingivalis proteolytic activity in escherichia coli.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly bacteroides gingivalis) degrades numerous protein substrates including collagen, fibrinogen, fibronectin, gelatin, casein,  immunoglobulins and complement components. in order to clone one or more of these protease genes, a genomic library was constructed with sau3a1 restriction fragments of chromosomal dna from p. gingivalis atcc 33277 ligated into the temperature-regulated vector pcqv2, and expressed in escherichia coli dh5 alpha mcr. the electro-transformants (3 x 10(4)) were screened for general protease activity on luria broth agar containing ampicillin (50 mg/l) and sodium caseinate (2%). one casein-hydrolyzing clone was detected and subcultured, and the activity of the cell extracts was characterized. we were able to show that the protease-positive clone, (ptem1), had broad substrate specificity. colorimetric assays indicated the hydrolysis of azocoll, azocasein, collagen, elastin-congo red and artificial substrates. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to confirm that collagen, casein, fibrinogen and fibronectin were degraded by the clone.

TI  == ecological effects of short-term ciprofloxacin treatment of travellers' diarrhoea.
AB  == forty-two subjects travelling to mexico for 11 days were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing ciprofloxacin 250 mg twice daily for three days or placebo for treatment of travellers' diarrhoea. seventeen (41%) subjects were randomized to treatment. by the last treatment day, all seven evaluable subjects in the ciprofloxacin group, and three of eight evaluable subjects in the placebo group were cured (p = 0.04). the mean time to cure was 26 h for ciprofloxacin and 60 h for placebo-treated patients (p = 0.03). faecal specimen were collected pre-travel, after four days in mexico, 48 h post-travel and four weeks post-travel. potentially pathogenic escherichia coli strains carrying diarrhoeagenic virulence genes were detected by dna hybridization tests, during or after travel, in 41% of treated and 31% of asymptomatic travellers. travel, irrespective of diarrhoea and type of treatment, had a minor impact on the aerobic and anaerobic microflora. in travellers with ongoing diarrhoea, a suppression of the numbers of anaerobic bacteria was found,  but the microflora was otherwise virtually unaffected. significantly increased frequencies of e. coli resistant to ampicillin, doxycycline, chloramphenicol and  co-trimoxazole were found during and after travel in all categories of travellers, though more frequently in subjects who experienced diarrhoea. the susceptibility of bacteroides spp. remained unchanged. the sensitivity of e. coli to ciprofloxacin was not affected by travel, except in four ciprofloxacin-treated subjects who acquired multiresistant e. coli with ciprofloxacin mics of > or = 0.125 mg/l post-travel. bacteroides strains with mics of > or = 64 mg/l were isolated post-travel from four ciprofloxacin-treated patients, and from one of the other 34 travellers not treated with ciprofloxacin.

TI  == effect of gels containing stannous fluoride on oral bacteria--an in vitro study.
AB  == the purposes of this investigation were to evaluate and compare the antimicrobial effect of (1) twelve 0.4 per cent stannous fluoride (snf2) commercial products and (2) different concentrations of snf2 (range = 0.02 to 3.28 per cent). the antibacterial inhibitory effect of various snf2 gels was evaluated as to their effectiveness against oral plaque bacteria including strains of s. mutans, s. sanguis, s. sobrinus, a. viscosus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and b. intermedius.  when twelve different commercial preparations of 0.4 per cent snf2 were compared  for inhibitory effect on plaque bacteria, several of the snf2 preparations were significantly more effective in inhibiting oral bacteria (p < 0.05). with increasing concentration of snf2, there was a comparable increase in the inhibitory effect on the oral bacteria tested (r2 ranged from 0.867 to 0.996). snf2 at a concentration of 0.4 per cent had a similar antibacterial effect to 0.12 per cent chlorhexidine. this in vitro study demonstrated that certain snf2 products are highly effective in inhibiting the growth of bacteria often found in plaque, and this inhibitory effect is directly related to the concentration of the snf2.

TI  == direct and indirect effects of porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide on interleukin-6 production by human gingival fibroblasts.
AB  == we examined the production of interleukin-6 (il-6) by human gingival fibroblasts  (atcc crl 1292) stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (lps) from porphyromonas gingivalis and escherichia coli, or supernatant of human peripheral blood adherent cell culture medium incubated in the presence of il-1 and the same two lps. confluent monolayers of gingival fibroblasts were incubated with stimulants  for 6 h at 37 degrees c in 5% co2 and air. after removal of stimulants, the cell  cultures were incubated for an additional 2 or 24 h in the same environment. at the end of the culture period, supernatants were collected and assayed for il-6 activity by stimulatory igg production with the human b-lymphoblastoid cell line  cess. the direct effect of lps on il-6 production by gingival fibroblasts was much weaker than the indirect one via il-1 production by adherent cells. the stimulating effect of culture supernatants of adherent cells stimulated with lps  on il-6 production by gingival fibroblasts was as effective as that of recombinant il-1, when this latter was added at a concentration equivalent to that contained in the culture supernatant of adherent cells. these results suggest that, although gingival fibroblasts may be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic periodontal disease by the production of cytokines, such a role may not result from a direct stimulation by periodontopathic bacteria. the phenomenon is more likely to be mediated indirectly by il-1 produced by infiltrating inflammatory cells.

TI  == in vitro killing of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and capnocytophaga spp.  by human neutrophil cathepsin g and elastase.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to compare the killing of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans with that of capnocytophaga spp. by purified cathepsin g and elastase in vitro. both were sensitive to killing by purified cathepsin g, but only the capnocytophaga spp. were killed by elastase. killing by cathepsin g  exhibited logarithmic kinetics, was enhanced slightly by alkaline ph, and was enhanced greatly under hypotonic conditions. treatment of cathepsin g with diisopropyl fluorophosphate significantly reduced its bactericidal activity against capnocytophaga spp. but not against escherichia coli or a. actinomycetemcomitans. the bactericidal effects of cathepsin g against capnocytophaga sputigena and a. actinomycetemcomitans were inhibited by alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, and alpha-2-macroglobulin but not  by bovine serum albumin. we conclude that (i) cathepsin g kills capnocytophaga spp. and a. actinomycetemcomitans, (ii) elastase kills capnocytophaga spp., (iii) the bactericidal activity of cathepsin g is enzyme dependent against capnocytophaga spp. and enzyme independent against a. actinomycetemcomitans, and  (iv) natural plasma antiproteases may control both enzyme-dependent and enzyme-independent bactericidal activities of cathepsin g.

TI  == in vitro killing of oral capnocytophaga by granule fractions of human neutrophils is associated with cathepsin g activity.
AB  == the capnocytophaga are inhabitants of the hypoxic human gingival crevice that are normally prevented by neutrophils from causing periodontal and systemic infection. to identify potential nonoxidative bactericidal mechanisms against capnocytophaga within human neutrophils, gel filtration chromatography was used to fractionate neutrophil granule extracts. seven granule fractions, designated a through g, were obtained. the capnocytophaga were most sensitive to killing by fraction d. fraction d exhibited substantial bactericidal activity under aerobic  and anaerobic conditions. the bactericidal activity associated with ion-exchange  subfractions d8-d11, which contained primarily cathepsin g as assessed by enzymatic activity, amino acid composition, and nh2-terminal sequence. heat-inactivation, diisopropylfluorophosphate, pmsf, and n-benzyloxycarbonylglycylleucylphenylalanyl-chloromethyl ketone inhibited bactericidal activity against capnocytophaga sputigena but not escherichia coli.  we conclude that (a) human neutrophil cathepsin g is an important antimicrobial system against the capnocytophaga, (b) the bactericidal activity of cathepsin g against capnocytophaga is oxygen independent, and (c) an intact enzyme active site is involved in the killing of c. sputigena but not e. coli. we suggest that  human neutrophil cathepsin g is an important antimicrobial system against certain oral bacteria and that cathepsin g kills bacteria by two distinct mechanisms.

AB  == oral, gram-negative, facultative bacteria, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga spp. have been associated with destructive periodontal infection. neutrophils play a critical role in defending the periodontium against destructive infection. defensins are antimicrobial peptides that have been isolated in human, rabbit, guinea pig, and  rat leukocytes that may constitute an important nonoxidative mechanism of killing. the purpose of this study was to examine the sensitivity of a battery of oral, gram-negative, facultative bacteria to the bactericidal effects of the isolated rabbit peptide np-1. all species tested were killed by np-1; however, there was strain-to-strain variation in sensitivity. the bactericidal effect was  not dependent on net bacterial growth, although metabolic activity was evident as assessed by bacterial oxygen consumption. we conclude that bacteria are sensitive to the cidal mechanism involved in defensin-mediated bacterial killing and that the conditions of this assay system support the killing of bacteria by the defensin peptides.

TI  == bacteroides gingivalis stimulates bone resorption via interleukin-1 production by mononuclear cells. the relative role for b. gingivalis endotoxin.
AB  == supernatants of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells cultured in the presence of b. gingivalis, showed a strong osteoclast stimulating activity as measured by  45ca release from fetal mouse long bones in vitro. these supernatants also contained a high concentration of bioactive and immunoreactive interleukin-1 (il-1), but tumor necrosis factor (tnfa), another osteoclast-activating cytokine, was not detected. osteoclast activation by the supernatants was inhibited by an antibody against il-1, whereas ultrapure human il-1 mimicked the effect of the supernatant. the ability of b. gingivalis to induce il-1 and oaf production was heat sensitive, as 20 min heating of the bacteria at 120 degrees c caused a 50% loss of activity. in addition, purified b. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (lps) had little il-1 inducing capacity, compared with lps of escherichia coli. these data suggest that human peripheral blood cells confronted with b. gingivalis produce large amounts of il-1 which has strong osteoclast stimulating activity. however, in contrast with e. coli lps, b. gingivalis lps does not seem to be the  major inducing agent. thus other bacterial components must be responsible for the observed il-1 and oaf induction.

AB  == the direct effects of the culture supernatant of oral microorganisms on the bactericidal activity of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns) were investigated. the bactericidal activity of pmns, which were preincubated with the supernatant of bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides melaninogenicus or phosphate-buffered saline, was examined by counting the surviving bacteria. b. gingivalis-treated pmns were found to have a diminished ability for killing bacteria in the presence or absence of serum. the chemiluminescence response of pmns, which were preincubated with the culture supernatant of b. gingivalis, was strikingly reduced compared with that of pmns preincubated with phosphate-buffered saline or other bacterial culture supernatants. the production of superoxide anion (o2-) by pmns stimulated with either formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine or phorbol myristate acetate was reduced in both cases after the pmns were preincubated with the culture supernatant of b. gingivalis. however, it was observed that there was more reduction in superoxide anion (o2-) production stimulated with formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine compared with that stimulated with phorbol  myristate acetate. these results suggest that b. gingivalis releases a factor which interferes with the bactericidal activity of pmns by modulating the generation of reactive oxygen species. these suppressive effects on bactericidal  activity may be important in the pathogenesis of this microorganism.

TI  == correlation of the extravascular pharmacokinetics of azithromycin with in-vivo efficacy in models of localized infection.
AB  == infection models were used to clarify the roles of serum and extravascular concentrations in the in-vivo efficacy observed with azithromycin. in-vivo experiments were designed to give serum concentrations well below the mic and tissue levels generally above the mic at time of challenge and during the course  of infection. the efficacy of azithromycin against a salmonella enteritidis oral  challenge (a tissue-associated infection model) in mice correlated directly with  azithromycin liver levels, but not serum concentrations. the significance of extravascular pharmacokinetics was observed in a comparative study of azithromycin and ciprofloxacin against the salmonella challenge. ciprofloxacin has a greater than 100-fold in-vitro potency advantage over azithromycin against  this organism, but azithromycin (5 mg/kg) produced a greater reduction in cfu than ciprofloxacin (100 mg/kg) at the primary site of infection (liver). in another model, extravascular fluid levels, measured by bioassay of implanted paper discs, were compared with plasma levels in relation to control of a localized staphylococcus aureus infection in rats. extravascular fluid levels of  azithromycin were greater than the mic of the strain used for five days after a 100 mg/kg dose, while erythromycin levels were less than 20% of the mic at 30 h after a 200 mg/kg dose. serum concentrations of both compounds were less than 20% of the mic at the time of challenge. the antibiotic levels at the site of infection correlated with the reduction of staph. aureus cfu (99% with azithromycin compared with controls, p less than 0.01; 0% with erythromycin) recovered from inoculated discs. the significance of extravascular concentrations of azithromycin was further supported in other models of localized infections induced with escherichia coli or a mixture of staph. aureus and bacteroides fragilis.

AB  == eight escherichia coli jm 109 transformants generated from a clone bank of bacteroides gingivalis 381 genomic dna, were found to express b. gingivalis antigens. quantitation of antigen expression by elisa indicated that isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside (iptg) was not necessary for antigen expression for any of the clones but that expression in 2 of the clones, st 2 and st 3, was increased in cells grown in the presence of iptg. western blot analysis revealed that the expressed protein of clone st 2 has a molecular weight of 125,000 dal. and that clone st 3 contains multiple bands of 30 to 50 kdal which react with the anti-b. gingivalis antiserum. three of the transformants were found to agglutinate sheep erythrocytes. polyclonal monospecific antiserum to one of the transformants, clone st 2, was found to react to 2 major bands of mws 43,000 and 38,000 and minor bands of 115,000, 105,000, 32,000, and 30,000 dal. present in b. gingivalis cell lysate preparations. adsorption of anti b. gingivalis antiserum with cells of clone st 2 reduced the hemagglutination inhibition activity of the antiserum 4-fold whereas antiserum to the clone itself inhibited b. gingivalis hemagglutination at a titer of 8 times that of normal rabbit serum. immunoelectronmicroscopic studies using the antiserum to clone st 2 indicate that the product of the cloned gene (hemagglutinin) is located on the b. gingivalis cell surface. a restriction map generated of the cloned b. gingivalis  dna fragment confirms the insert to be 3.2 kbases and indicates the possibility of a repeated sequence in the fragment.

AB  == the present study was performed to investigate the effects of endotoxins from periodontopathic bacteria on collagen metabolism. endotoxins were extracted from  bacteroides gingivalis 381 and bacteroides intermedius atcc 25611 using the hot-phenol method. a commercially available endotoxin from escherichia coli 0111: b4 was also used as a control. human gingival fibroblasts (gin-1, atcc crl 1292)  were maintained with dmem containing 10% fbs. when the fibroblasts became confluent they were exposed to each of the endotoxins in various concentrations (0, 5, 10, 15, 20 micrograms/ml). the effects of these endotoxins on the collagen metabolism of the fibroblasts were assessed on the basis of collagen synthesis and collagenase activity. the former was assessed by 3h-proline incorporation and bacterial collagenase digestable protein. the latter was assessed by fibril assay. the results were as follows: there was no change in glucose consumption, cell viability or morphology under the light microscope when the concentration of endotoxin was 20 micrograms/ml or less. 3h-proline incorporation into protein and collagen synthesis were inclined to decrease. endotoxin from b. gingivalis resulted in an acceleration of collagenase activity. there findings indicate that the endotoxins from these bacteria might affect collagen metabolism early in gingivitis in vivo.

TI  == suppression of fibroblast growth by bacteroides gingivalis endotoxin is not reduced by serum lipoproteins.
AB  == previous studies indicated that bacteroides and e. coli endotoxins caused a dose-dependent inhibition of human fibroblast growth. however, these endotoxins were relatively weak inhibitors of growth. since cells were grown with serum, we  questioned whether serum lipoproteins, which lessen endotoxin cytotoxicity in vivo, reduced the growth inhibitory effects of endotoxins in vitro. to determine  whether serum lipoproteins reduced the growth inhibitory effects of endotoxins, logarithmically growing human periodontal cells were incubated with endotoxin and high density (hdl) or low density lipoprotein (ldl). neither hdl nor ldl significantly reduced the initial growth inhibitory effects of b. gingivalis or e. coli endotoxins, as judged by 3h-thymidine incorporation. even with prolonged  exposure of up to 10 days in culture, hdl did not ameliorate growth inhibition by endotoxin, as determined by direct cell counts. we conclude that serum lipoproteins do not provide any significant protective effects against fibroblast growth inhibition by endotoxins in vitro.

TI  == bacteroides-specific igg and iga subclass antibody-secreting cells isolated from  chronically inflamed gingival tissues.
AB  == the emergence of cells that produce igg and iga subclass antibodies to bacteroides gingivalis (porphyromonas gingivalis) fimbriae and lipopolysaccharide (lps) antigens was examined in mononuclear cells isolated from inflamed gingiva of different stages (slight, moderate or advanced) of adult periodontitis (ap). antigen-specific igm, igg (including igg1, igg2, igg3 and igg4) and iga (including iga1 and iga2) producing cells were enumerated by the elispot assay and were compared with total ig-producing cells of each isotype or subclass. in advanced ap, the b. gingivalis fimbriae-specific igg- and iga-secreting cells represented 5% of total igg- or iga-secreting cells, while those from the moderate stage comprised approximately 1% of these two isotypes. cells producing  antibody specific for b. gingivalis lps were observed at frequencies of 0.1% and  0.4% for igg and iga cells, respectively in the advanced stage. when igg subclasses were analysed in moderate ap, the anti-fimbriae subclass responses were largely igg1 (60%), followed by igg2 (20%), igg3 (10%) and igg4 (10%). fimbriae-specific igg subclass responses were elevated in the advanced stage of ap, and igg4 (40%) and igg1 (30%) were dominant, followed by igg3 (20%) and igg2  (10%). iga1 cells predominated in both the moderate and advanced stages, however  a relative increase in iga2 cells occurred in advanced ap. mononuclear cells isolated from gingiva of ap patients did not contain cells producing antibody to  antigens such as escherichia coli k235 lps, cholera toxin or the hapten dinitrophenyl coupled to bovine serum albumin. these results show that local igg  and iga subclass responses occur to a protein antigen of a major periodontal disease (pd)-associated pathogen, b. gingivalis, and the increase in igg4 and iga2 responses may be associated with host protection.

TI  == activity of fce 22891 compared with cefuroxime axetil and cefixime in pulmonary and subcutaneous infections in mice.
AB  == the therapeutic activity of fce 22891 was compared with that of two new oral cephalosporins, cefuroxime axetil and cefixime against streptococcus pneumoniae respiratory infection and subcutaneous abscesses induced by mixed aerobes and anaerobes in mice. in experimental pneumonia fce 22891 was the most active antibiotic. in aerobic abscesses fce 22891 proved the most active agent in infections induced by methicillin susceptible and resistant staphylococcus aureus while all three compounds were very active, against str. pyogenes. in abscesses caused by gram-negative bacteria, fce 22891 showed good and constant efficacy. cefixime was the most active drug against the two susceptible strains of escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae and also against resistant esch. coli but was inactive against a strain of ent. cloacae that produced cephalosporinase. cefuroxime axetil was less active than the other two drugs against gram-negative  bacteria with adequate efficacy only against a susceptible strain of ent. cloacae. fce 22891 was more effective than cefixime and cefuroxime axetil in preventing and reducing the size of abscesses induced by bacteroides fragilis 101. we conclude that fce 22891, despite its short half life of 6 min in mice, exerts comparable and sometimes better activity than the two oral cephalosporins  characterized by longer half lives.

TI  == [effect of norfloxacin on bacterial flora in human feces].
AB  == norfloxacin (nflx), a synthetic oral antibacterial agent of quinolone carboxylic  acid, was given orally for 5 full days at a dose of 200 mg, three times daily after each meal to healthy normal men with ages between 22 and 25 years weighing  53.0 to 84.0 kg (average 67.0 kg). the actual regimen followed was that the drug  was administered twice after lunch and supper on the first day of dosing, and once after breakfast on the last day of dosing. on the 5th day before the start of dosing, on the first, 3rd and 5th days (last dosing day) of dosing, and on the 3rd, 5th, 10th and 20th days after the end of dosing, effects of the drug on the  fecal flora were examined and its fecal levels were determined. susceptibilities  against nflx and nalidixic acid (na) of various fecal isolates from 7 men were determined. adverse effects and influences on clinical laboratory tests were also examined. the results obtained are summarized below. 1. following the drug administration, a transient decrease or disappearance of escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., citrobacter sp. and enterobacter sp. of enterobacteriaceae was noted. the 3 strains other than e. coli were isolated from increasing number of cases after the end of dosing. no constant trend was observed in the isolation of proteus sp. organisms belong to enterobacteriaceae were isolated only in 4 and 2  cases after 3 and 5 days of the start of dosing, respectively, but then gradually increased to the predose level. among other gram-negative bacteria, no constant trend was noted in the isolation frequency of plesiomonas sp. pseudomonas sp. was isolated from 6 and 5 cases on the 3rd day after dosing and on the 3rd day after  the end of dosing, respectively; the frequency of isolation increased after dosing. gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus sp. were isolated with a reduced frequency on the 3rd day of dosing. however, the number of isolates increased in all cases both on the 5th day of dosing and on the 3rd day after the end of dosing, and then decreased. no change was noticed in the number of isolates of enterococcus sp., and no constant trend was observed for micrococcus  sp. and ylo. the average count of the whole aerobic bacteria did not change. some strains decreased significantly after the start of dosing. 2. among anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis and other bacteroides were isolated on every test day.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == effect of infection with eimeria tenella upon the cecal bacterial population in monoflora chickens.
AB  == monoflora chickens were established at 2 days of age by an oral inoculation with  one of six species of bacteria (lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium thermophilum, bacteroides vulgatus, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, or streptococcus faecalis) and were infected with eimeria tenella (5 x 10(4) oocysts per bird) 2 days later. there were two experimental groups for each bacterium: birds infected with bacteria alone and birds infected with a combination of bacteria and e. tenella. seven days after e. tenella infection, counts of b. thermophilum in the cecal contents were significantly lower for e. tenella-infected birds than for those infected by b. thermophilum alone, whereas  10 days after e. tenella infection, counts were higher for e. tennella-infected birds. the population of l. acidophilus in the cecal contents of the e. tenella-infected chickens 10 days after inoculation was significantly greater than that in uninfected chickens. no significant differences were observed between the numbers of b. vulgatus, c. perfringens, and s. faecalis in cecal contents of groups with and without e. tenella infections.

TI  == therapeutic efficacy and pharmacokinetic properties of ciprofloxacin in intra-abdominal abscesses caused by bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli.
AB  == experimental intra-abdominal abscesses were produced in mice by intraperitoneal injections of bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli. the therapeutic efficacy of ciprofloxacin was investigated in this mixed intra-abdominal abscess model and was compared with that of rifampicin. treatment with ciprofloxacin at 0.2 to 20 mg/kg or rifampicin at 20 mg/kg prevented all mice from death, as compared to the 60% mortality rate observed in the vehicle-treated controls. rifampicin concentrations at 10 and 20 mg/kg were effective in preventing abscess formation  and eradicated bacterial abscess. ciprofloxacin at all the levels tested neither  reduced the incidence of abscess nor eradicated bact. fragilis from abscesses. however, ciprofloxacin at levels of 20, 10, 5, and 1 mg/kg reduced significantly  the number of e. coli cells in the abscess. the peak serum level of ciprofloxacin at the oral dose of 20 mg/kg was 0.43 mg/l which was well above the mic values for e. coli but not for bact. fragilis.

TI  == oral neomycin and erythromycin compared with single-dose systemic metronidazole and ceftriaxone prophylaxis in elective colorectal surgery.
AB  == a prospective randomized trial was performed to compare oral neomycin and erythromycin with single-dose intravenous metronidazole and ceftriaxone in elective colorectal surgery. the study was discontinued after 60 patients were entered. the overall rate of infection was 41 percent in the oral neomycin and erythromycin group (n = 29) compared with 9.6 percent in those who received intravenous metronidazole and ceftriaxone (n = 31) (p less than 0.01). infections in the oral group were principally due to resistant staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis, and escherichia coli. preoperative administration of oral neomycin and erythromycin was associated with a significant reduction of escherichia coli counts (1 x 10(7) to 3 x 10(5) organisms/ml, p less than 0.05) compared with the intravenous group, but there was no significant reduction in the counts of bacteroides fragilis (2 x 10(8) to 1 x 10(7) organisms/ml) and there was an increase in the counts of clostridia (2 x 10(4) to 1 x 10(6) organisms/ml). these results indicate that single-dose systemic prophylaxis with  appropriate antibiotics is superior to oral neomycin and erythromycin.

TI  == impact of oral ciprofloxacin on the faecal flora of healthy volunteers.
AB  == the intestinal flora was studied in 12 volunteers after the administration of 400 mg ciprofloxacin b.i.d. over seven days. stool samples were taken prior to and several times after the initiation of therapy, and qualitative and quantitative analyses of microorganisms were performed. escherichia coli was eliminated in all volunteers after two days of treatment. a selection of resistant enterobacteria could not be observed. a higher incidence of streptococcus faecium was seen, mainly after the end of drug application. the number of cfu of bacteroides and bifidus species remained unchanged during the trial. there was no selection of clostridium difficile. based on this pattern of activity on the stool flora we suggest that ciprofloxacin could represent an appropriate drug for the therapy of bacterial intestinal infections as well as for selective decontamination in immunosuppressed patients.

TI  == the development of bacterial flora of premature neonates.
AB  == the sequential acquisition of bacterial flora by premature neonates was studied during a 10 month period. mean gestational age of the babies was 29.01 weeks and  the mean birth weight was 1.728 kg. escherichia coli and group b streptococci (gbs) colonized the umbilicus of 7 and 6 babies respectively, out of 23 studied,  on the first day of life. e. coli and staphylococci were the predominant flora on the 6th day and they colonized 12 and 13 respectively. the oral flora was predominantly gram-positive cocci, mainly streptococcus salivarius which was isolated from 17 out of 22 babies on the 6th day, viridans streptococci were isolated from 14 babies, staphylococcus albus from 16 babies and group d streptococci from 11 babies. candida spp. also colonized the oral cavities of 17  out of 22 babies on the 6th day. at the end of the first week of life, the faecal flora was predominantly anaerobic represented by bifidobacterium spp., bacteroides spp. and clostridium spp. the commonest facultative faecal flora were e. coli, which was isolated from all the babies, and strept. faecalis isolated from 20 babies. early gut colonization by gbs, bacteroides spp. and clostridium spp. was noticed in more babies delivered vaginally than by caesarean section where colonization by these bacteria was relatively delayed. the use of prophylactic penicillin plus gentamicin in the special neonatal unit probably prevented systemic spread of any of the potential opportunistic pathogens during  the study.

TI  == response of a 'susceptible' escherichia coli to metronidazole therapy: an investigation using experimental subcutaneous abscesses.
AB  == earlier experiments under anaerobic conditions in vitro had indicated that gram-negative facultative anaerobes were susceptible to therapeutically attainable concentrations of metronidazole. this prompted us to study the response of one such strain to metronidazole therapy. mice with 3-day-old subcutaneous abscesses induced by 'susceptible' escherichia coli (accompanied by  potentiating agent and obligately anaerobic bacteroides fragilis) were given metronidazole by mouth (250 mg/kg/dose 12 hourly) either as a two- or a four-dose course. this therapy reduced the viable numbers of e. coli/abscess by a mere 0.3  log10 and 0.7 log10, respectively. assays showed that concentrations of metronidazole in abscess-contents compared favourably with those in the earlier in vitro experiments. but measurement of redox potentials in abscesses indicated  that the conditions in these (-191 mv vs. ag/agcl) were not nearly as reduced as  those in experiments in vitro (-650 mv). this, and the known dependence of metronidazole on low redox potentials for expression of its antimicrobial ability, appears to be the explanation for the poor anticoliform effect in the subcutaneous abscess model. full assessment of the clinical implications of these observations must await the availability of data regarding redox potentials in clinical situations.

TI  == effect of metronidazole on escherichia coli in the presence of bacteroides fragilis: an investigation in mice.
AB  == the observation that, in rats, metronidazole exhibited antimicrobial activity against resistant escherichia coli (when this was accompanied by susceptible bacteroides fragilis) prompted us to attempt to reproduce this phenomenon in another species and under other experimental conditions. in experiment 1, mice injected intraperitoneally with an e. coli/b. fragilis mixture were treated with  metronidazole, 250 mg/kg given by mouth at 0 and 10 h, or left untreated. at 24 h, viable counts of bacteria in blood and peritoneal washings were determined. in experiment 2, mice with 5-day-old subcutaneous abscesses containing e. coli and b. fragilis were also either given metronidazole as above or left untreated. at 24 h, viable counts of bacteria in pus were determined. metronidazole affected neither the frequency with which e. coli persisted at the three sites, nor the viability of e. coli at these sites. this was so despite the fact that, in each of the sites, a significant b. fragilis kill was registered. thus, pending elucidation of the mechanism by which the phenomenon operates, its non-appearance in these experiments cautions against the extrapolation of the original observations beyond the circumstances under which they were first made.

TI  == endotoxin-induced changes in copper and zinc metabolism in the syrian hamster.
AB  == the temporal response of zinc and copper metabolism to endotoxin administration was examined in syrian hamsters over a 144-hour period. serum copper was significantly elevated at 12, 24 and 72 hours after endotoxin, whereas serum zinc was reduced 4-48 hours after treatment. a brief elevation (8 hours) in liver copper concentration and a sustained (72 hours) increase in liver zinc concentration were also observed. the amount of zinc associated with liver metallothionein (mt) progressively increased with time, to a plateau by 24 hours  and persisted at the elevated level until 72 hours after endotoxin treatment. in  vitro translation of poly (a)+ rna from liver polyribosomes showed that following endotoxin treatment mtmrna activity was maximally elevated 6 hours after endotoxin administration and remained elevated 24 and 48 hours thereafter. slab gel electrophoresis of serum proteins indicated changes in a stainable protein comigrating with purified ceruloplasmin after endotoxin administration. pooled gingival tissue from endotoxin-treated hamsters demonstrated a consistently elevated copper content 12-144 hours after treatment. endotoxin isolated from bacteroides melaninogenicus was more effective in elevating gingival and serum copper and gingival zinc than escherichia coli endotoxin. it was concluded that endotoxin administration elicits responses that result in enhanced metaollthionein mrna activity. in addition, cu and zn concentrations in serum, liver and gingival tissue are influenced by different endotoxins to different degrees.

AB  == the effect of primary aliphatic alcohols of varying chain length and degree of unsaturation on bacterial growth was assessed, using strep. mutans bht as the main test organism. unsaturated alcohols, linoleyl and linolenyl, effectively inhibited bacterial growth. of the saturated alcohols, only lauryl and myristyl alcohols inhibited the growth of strep. mutans bht, but at concentrations much higher than those required for the unsaturated alcohols. all gram-positive organisms tested were sensitive to linolenyl alcohol. gram-negative bacteria did  not exhibit the sensitivity. linoleic and linolenic acid were inactive as antibacterial agents at the same concentration as the related alcohol. repeated exposure of strep. mutans bht to linolenyl alcohol produced no change in the sensitivity of the organism to the alcohol. significant amounts of linolenyl alcohol were found in bacteria grown in the presence of this lipid for 24 h but linolenic acid was not detected. thus the primary polyunsaturated aliphatic alcohols, particularly linolenyl alcohol, could be effective antibacterial agents for the prevention of dental caries and periodontal disease.

AB  == candida albicans, administered by gastric intubation, persisted in the gastrointestinal tract of gnotobiotic mice for long periods but was eliminated within a relatively short period of time in pathogen-free mice. oxytetracycline administered by mouth had no reproducible effect on the persistence of c. albicans in the gastrointestinal tract of either germ-free or pathogen-free mice. prolonged administration of streptomycin extended the time that c. albicans could be recovered from feces of pathogen-free mice when compared to mice not receiving the antibiotic or those receiving a single large dose. there was a brief interval of time during which c. albicans could not be recovered from the feces of gnotobiotic mice contaminated with certain intestinal bacteria, but eventually all mice began to shed the fungus again. c. albicans administered by mouth was not pathogenic for germ-free or pathogen-free mice. it can be concluded from these findings that mice do not possess an innate resistance to c. albicans but that pathogen-free mice do possess some ecological mechanism which prevents establishment of the fungus in their gastrointestinal tract. the reason for the difference in colonization of c. albicans in germ-free or gnotobiotic mice and pathogen-free mice was not determined.

TI  == endotoxin: stimulation of bone resorption in tissue culture.
AB  == bacterial endotoxins can stimulate the release of previously incorporated calcium-45 and tritiated proline from fetal rat bone in tissue culture. endotoxin from bacteroides melaninogenicus, an organism regularly found in the gingival crevice of man, produces a response similar to parathyroid hormone and is effective at doses as low as 0.1 microgram per milliliter. this response is inhibited by serum and dependent upon the presence of albumin. endotoxins may play a role in the bone loss characteristic of human periodontal disease.
