TI  == synthesis of n-substituted 5-iodouracils as antimicrobial and anticancer agents.
AB  == this study reports the synthesis of some substituted 5-iodouracils and their bioactivities. alkylation of 5-iodouracils gave predominately n1-substituted-(r)-5-iodouracil compounds 7a-d (r = n-c(4)h(9), s-c(4)h(9), ch(2)c(6)h(11), ch(2)c(6)h(5)) together with n1,n3-disubstituted (r) analogs 8a-b (r = n-c(4)h(9), ch(2)c(6)h(11)). their antimicrobial activity was tested against 27 strains of microorganisms using the agar dilution method. the analogs 7a, 7c and 7d displayed 25-50% inhibition against branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria mucosa and streptococcus pyogenes at 0.128 mg/ml. no antimalarial activity was detected for any of the analogs when tested against plasmodium falciparum (t9.94). their anticancer activity was also examined. cyclohexylmethyl analogs 7c and 8b inhibited the growth of hepg2 cells. significantly, n1,n3-dicyclohexylmethyl analog 8b displayed the most potent anticancer activity, with an ic(50) of 16.5 microg/ml. these 5-iodouracil analogs represent a new group of anticancer and antibacterial agents with potential for development for medicinal applications.

TI  == nasal carriage of pathogenic bacteria in medical students: effects of clinic exposure on prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of community-acquired and nosocomial infections worldwide. one important source of this pathogen for nosocomial infections is the nasal carriage of s. aureus among hospital personnel. there are only a few studies investigating the carriage of s. aureus in a community of medical students. oral and nasal flora of 179 medical students with varying clinical exposures were determined. oral cultures revealed no nosocomial pathogen and nasal cultures showed an increasing rate of s. aureus carriage with increasing clinical exposure. methicillin resistance also demonstrated a tendency toward increasing with increasing clinical exposure.
