TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == [clinical examination of ceftibuten in acute bronchitis].
AB  == clinical evaluation of ceftibuten (cetb, 7432-s) was performed in 20 patients with acute bronchitis. they were consisted of 10 males and 10 females aged from 20 to 80 years old. cetb was given orally in daily dose of 300 mg (18 cases) or 600 mg (2 cases) in three divided portions. the duration of administration was 3  to 14 days. especially they were given for 7 days in 16 cases. a total of 11 strains comprising 4 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 2 strains of beta-streptococcus and 1 strain each of streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis, klebsiella oxytoca, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii were  identified from sputa before administration. all of the above bacteria were eradicated but, in 1 case, a strain of streptococcus pyogenes appeared after the  treatment (eradication ratio = 100%). the clinical efficacy rate was 100%: responses were excellent in 3 cases and good in 17 cases. there was no side effect and no abnormal changes in laboratory test results. from the avobe results, it is concluded that cetb is effective, safe and useful new oral cephem  on acute bronchitis.
