TI  == evaluation of root canal bacteria and their antimicrobial susceptibility in teeth with necrotic pulp.
AB  == this study aimed to evaluate the microbiota of necrotic pulp in teeth without carious lesions where the crown and root were intact and to test the sensitivity  of this microbiota to antibiotics in order to improve treatment. the necrotic pulp was sampled from 26 single-rooted teeth in intact pulp chambers. a total of  84 strains were isolated. the number of species isolated per tooth varied from 2  to 8, with a strong component (81%) of anaerobic bacteria. the most commonly represented species were bacteroides gracilis, propionibacterium acnes, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella buccae and eubacterium lentum. the sensitivity of these organisms to amoxicillin, amoxicillin combined with clavulanate and tetracycline was evaluated by etest on 38 isolates. for all strains tested, the minimum inhibitory concentration values obtained were low and substantially below effective serum concentrations for these antibiotics. these data enable us to devise suitable treatments for acute development of apical lesions and to prevent dissemination of this source of infection to the rest of the host.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == to assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7  gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. for comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against prevotella oralis, prevotella buccalis, prevotella bivia, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, bacteroides corporis, bacteroides gracilis, fusobacterium necrophorum, fusobacterium naviforme and propionibacterium acnes. prevotella oris, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and prevotella denticola, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides pneumosintes, and peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. strains of veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptostreptococcus magnus showed mics of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. the results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving bacteroides fragilis.
