TI  == an assessment of adhesion, aggregation and surface charges of lactobacillus strains derived from the human oral cavity.
AB  == there is limited information concerning the adhesion and aggregation of human oral lactobacilli. in this study, the adhesion of 10 lactobacillus species was investigated using h357 oral keratinocyte cells as an in vitro model for oral mucosa. coaggregation with the representative oral pathogen, streptococcus mutans atcc 25175, and the physicochemical cell properties was also evaluated. the results demonstrated significant variations in adhesion (42-96%) and aggregation  (autoaggregation, 14-95%; coaggregation, 19-65%). all strains showed a high affinity for chloroform, and most strains had a moderate-to-high hydrophobicity.  all strains, except lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus gasseri, showed a moderate affinity for ethyl acetate. there was a strong association of autoaggregation with coaggregation (rs = 0.883, p < 0.001). the highest mean for  autoaggregation (74%) and coaggregation (47%) belonged to the lact. gasseri strains. correlations between the adhesion and surface characteristics and aggregation were observed among the lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus paracasei strains; however, there was a variation in the strains properties within and between species. this study indicated that the lact. gasseri, lact. fermentum, and lact. paracasei strains might be potential probiotics for the human oral cavity given their desirable properties. it should also be emphasized  that a selective process for probiotic strains is required. significance and impact of the study: adhesion to host tissues and bacterial aggregation (auto- and coaggregation) are the highly important criteria for selecting strains with probiotic potential. these abilities are commonly involved with surface-charged characteristics. this is the first study to investigate the oral lactobacillus species using an oral keratinocyte cell line. significant results were found for  the correlations between the adhesion and surface charge characteristics and for  aggregation among certain strains of lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus paracasei. this observation could be useful when collecting background information for the selection of probiotic strains for use  in oral health.

TI  == investigation of probiotic bacteria as dental caries and periodontal disease biotherapeutics.
AB  == oral diseases, specifically dental caries and periodontal disease, are characterised by increases in pathogenic microorganisms, increased demineralisation and increased inflammation and levels of inflammatory markers. despite the therapeutic strategies, oral diseases have elevated prevalence rates. recent work has demonstrated that probiotic bio-therapeutics can decrease oral pathogen counts, including caries-causing streptococcus mutans and oral inflammation. the aim of this work was to investigate putative probiotic bacteria, selected for s. mutans inhibition and for their oral health-promoting characteristics. the probiotic bacteria were screened for s. mutans inhibition, probiotic bacteriocin activity, salivary ph modulation, probiotic nutrient (sucrose) competition, probiotic co-aggregation with s. mutans, bacterial attachment to oral epithelial keratinocytes, bacterial nitric oxide production and bacterial antioxidant activity. the results indicate that lactobacillus reuteri strains ncimb 701359, ncimb 701089, ncimb 702655 and ncimb 702656 inhibited s. mutans to non-detectable levels (<10 cfu/ml). l. reuteri strains also demonstrated the highest antioxidant capacity of the tested strains (7.73-13.99 microm trolox equivalents), suggesting their use as both caries and periodontal disease therapeutics. although lactobacillus fermentum ncimb 5221 inhibited s. mutans at lower levels, it significantly buffered the ph (4.18) of saliva containing s. mutans, co-aggregated with s. mutans (10.09%), demonstrated  high levels of sucrose consumption (138.11 mm) and successfully attached to gingival epithelial cells (11%). this study identified four l. reuteri strains and one l. fermentum strain to be further investigated as oral disease biotherapeutics.

TI  == antibiotic resistance and capacity for biofilm formation of different bacteria isolated from endodontic infections associated with root-filled teeth.
AB  == introduction: to date, a variety of microbial species have been isolated from endodontic infections. however, endodontic clinical bacterial isolates have not been sufficiently characterized with regard to their capacity for antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation. in this study, antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation of 47 different aerobic and anaerobic bacterial isolates, belonging to 32 different species previously isolated from infected filled root canals, were studied. methods: antibiotic sensitivity to 11 antibiotics including penicillin g, amoxicillin, clindamycin, gentamicin, vancomycin, tetracycline, doxycycline, fosfomycin, rifampicin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin was tested using the standardized etest method (bio merieux, marcy-1'etoile, france). the antibiotic sensitivity of 4 control strains was also estimated in parallel. additionally, the capacity to form biofilms was quantified using the microtiter plate test. results: different aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species were either resistant against a number of antibiotics or showed high minimal inhibitory concentrations against clinically relevant antibiotics. five aerobic and 2 anaerobic isolates, including enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans,  lactobacillus fermentum, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, prevotella buccae, and propionibacterium acidifaciens, were characterized as being high biofilm producers, whereas 8 aerobic and 3 anaerobic isolates were found to be moderate biofilm producers. most isolates with resistance or markedly high minimal inhibitory concentration values were also either moderate biofilm producers or high biofilm producers. conclusions: these results suggest that the  clinical significance of endodontic infections could include that they serve as a reservoir for antibiotic resistance. furthermore, endodontic treatment should consider the adhesion and biofilm formation by a variety of bacteria.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic growth effects of lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus salivarius and their fermentative broth on periodontal pathogens.
AB  == as lactobacilli possess an antagonistic growth property, these bacteria may be beneficial as bioprotective agents for infection control. however, whether the antagonistic growth effects are attributed to the lactobacilli themselves or their fermentative broth remains unclear. the antagonistic growth effects of lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus fermentum as well as their fermentative broth were thus tested using both disc agar diffusion test and broth dilution method, and their effects on periodontal pathogens, including streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, and porphyromonas gingivalis in vitro at different concentrations and for different time periods were also compared. both lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus fermentum and their concentrated fermentative broth were shown to inhibit significantly the growth of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, and porphyromonas gingivalis, although different inhibitory effects were observed for different pathogens. the  higher the counts of lactobacilli and the higher the folds of concentrated fermentative broth, the stronger the inhibitory effects are observed. the inhibitory effect is demonstrated to be dose-dependent. moreover, for the lactobacilli themselves, lactobacillus fermentum showed stronger inhibitory effects than lactobacillus salivarius. however, the fermentative broth of lactobacillus fermentum showed weaker inhibitory effects than that of lactobacillus salivarius. these data suggested that lactobacilli and their fermentative broth exhibit antagonistic growth activity, and consumption of probiotics or their broth containing lactobacilli may benefit oral health.

TI  == [characterization of a probiotic lactobacillus strain isolated from oral cavity].
AB  == objective: from oral cavity we isolated and characterized probiotic lactobacilli  that could probability be applied to therapy and prevention of oral diseases. methods: lactobacillus strains were isolated by plating the saliva and dental plaque of healthy donors on selective medium. then the target strains were tested for inhibiting the growth of a streptococcus mutans strain belonging to cariogenic pathogen species. other properties such as production of extracellular polysaccharide and resistance to the antibacterial substances were also investigated. results: lactobacillus fermentum y29, a strain with antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, was obtained from dental plaque. this strain was an extracellular polysaccharide producer, which corresponds to its aggregation ability. moreover, l. fermentum y29 showed resistance to 1.0 mg/ml lysozyme and 140 microg/g hydrogen peroxide that may guarantee its persistence in the complex oral niche. conclusion: probiotic properties were characterized of an oral isolate l. fermentum y29, which provided a possibility for its application in prevention and treatment of oral diseases.

TI  == prevalence of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus fermentum and their association with caries and dietary habits in preschool thai children.
AB  == aims: to detect the prevalence of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus fermentum in plaque obtained from severe early childhood caries (s-ecc) and caries-free (cf) groups and to assess any association between their prevalence, feeding habits and oral hygiene practices within each group. study design: sixty-four supra-gingival plaque samples were collected from s-ecc and cf groups  (cf = 30, s-ecc = 34). all participants were asked about feeding habits and oral  hygiene care behaviour by direct questionnaire. methods: after dna extraction, s. mutans and l. fermentum were amplified using standard pcr. nested pcr was performed as a second identification method for s. mutans. results: mean age in cf and s-ecc was 2.29 +/- 0.42 and 2.49 +/- 0.41 years, respectively. mean dmft in s-ecc was 4.51 +/- 0.72. by standard pcr, no s. mutans was detected in cf group, while 10 % was detected in s-ecc group. by nested pcr, s. mutans was detected for 48 and 50 % in cf and s-ecc, respectively. l. fermentum was detected for 16 and 40 % in cf and s-ecc, respectively. conclusion: nested pcr gave a higher detection frequency than standard pcr but not significant (p </= 0.05). the prevalence of s. mutans was not different between the two groups, while the prevalence of l. fermentum was significantly associated with s-ecc (p </= 0.05).

TI  == shifts in the microbial population in relation to in situ caries progression.
AB  == the shift in microbial diversity from young to mature plaque, related to caries activity on sound and restored surfaces, was studied using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. during a 20-week in situ study on caries progression 8 subjects wearing restored and unrestored dentin and enamel sections, biofilm was  sampled after 1 and 20 weeks (young or mature plaque). a higher microbial diversity (mature plaque) was seen in caries-active compared to caries-free subjects. rothia dentocariosa and scardovia inopinata were absent from all caries-free sites, but appeared in 50% of the caries-active sites.

TI  == antimicrobial and safety properties of lactobacilli isolated from two cameroonian traditional fermented foods.
AB  == twenty-one lactobacillus isolates from "sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. these isolates were preliminarily identified as lactobacillus plantarum (62%), lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-pcr genomic fingerprinting. twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, proteinase k) and inhibition of other lactobacillus spp. these  bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin g, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. the bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria,  several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the world health organization, as well as multidrug-resistant strains. these include staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare typhi, bacillus cereus, streptococcus mutans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  klebsiella pneumoniae and shigella flexneri. these lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.

TI  == characterization of streptococcus oligofermentans sucrose metabolism demonstrates reduced pyruvic and lactic acid production.
AB  == background: streptococcus (s.) oligofermentans is a newly identified bacteria with a yet to be defined mechanism of sucrose metabolism that results in acid production. this study aimed to investigate the biochemical mechanisms of s. oligoferm-entans glucose metaolism. methods: the s. oligofermentans lmg21532, lactobacillus (l.) fermentum 38 and the s. mutans ua140 were used to characterize sucrose metabolism by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) activity and lactic acid production. continuous dynamics and high performance capillary electrophoresis were used to determine ldh activity and lactic acid production, respectively, from bacteria collected at 0, 10 and 30 minutes after cultured in 10% sucrose. results: these analyses demonstrated that ldh activity of the three  bacterial strains examined remained stable but significantly different throughout the sucrose fermentation process. the s. oligofermentans ldh activity ((0.61 +/-  0.05) u/mg) was significantly lower than that of l. fermentum ((52.91 +/- 8.97) u/mg). in addition, the s. oligofermentans total lactate production ((0.048 +/- 0.021) mmol/l) was also significantly lower than that of l. fermentum ((0.958 +/- 0.201) mmol/l). although the s. oligofermentans ldh production was almost double  of that produced by s. mutans ((0.32 +/- 0.07) u/mg), lactic acid production was  approximately one sixth that of s. mutans ((0.296 +/- 0.058) mmol/l). additional  tests examining pyruvic acid production (the ldh substrate) demonstrated that lactic acid concentrations correlated with pyruvic acid production. that is, pyruvic acid production by s. oligofermentans was undetectable following sucrose  incubation, however, (0.074 +/- 0.024) and (0.175 +/- 0.098) mmol/l pyruvic acid  were produced by s. mutans and l. fermentum, respectively. conclusion: s. oligofermentans is incapable of fermenting carbohydrates to produce enough pyruvic acid, which results in reduced lactic acid production.

TI  == inhibitory effect of oral lactobacillus against oral pathogens.
AB  == aims: to determine the inhibitory effect of oral lactobacillus against putative oral pathogens. methods and results: total 357 strains comprising 10 species of oral lactobacillus, lactobacillus fermentum (195), lactobacillus salivarius (53), lactobacillus casei (20), lactobacillus gasseri (18), lactobacillus rhamnosus (14), lactobacillus paracasei (12), lactobacillus mucosae (12), lactobacillus oris (12), lactobacillus plantarum (11) and lactobacillus vaginalis (10) were used as producer strains. inhibitory effect against a panel of indicators, periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens, was assessed. most oral lactobacillus was able to inhibit the growth of both periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens. the strongest inhibitory activity was associated with lact. paracasei, lact. plantarum, lact. rhamnosus, lact. casei and lact. salivarius. lactobacillus sd1-sd6, representing the six species with the strong inhibitory effect, inhibited growth of streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 in the biofilm model. also, it was demonstrated that growth of strep. mutans was inhibited in a mixture with lact. paracasei sd1. the inhibition was enhanced in acidic condition and 5% glucose. conclusions: the results have shown that oral lactobacillus sd1-sd6 showed a strong inhibitory effect against strep. mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, as well as, gram-negative periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. significance  and impact of the study: the results indicated that lactobacillus may be of benefit as probiotics for the prevention of oral diseases.

TI  == the anti-biofouling effect of lactobacillus fermentum-derived biosurfactant against streptococcus mutans.
AB  == biofouling in the oral cavity often causes serious problems. the ability of streptococcus mutans to synthesize extracellular glucans from sucrose using glucosyltransferases (gtfs) is vital for the initiation and progression of dental caries. recently, it was demonstrated that some biological compounds, such as secondary metabolites of probiotic bacteria, have an anti-biofouling effect. in this study, s. mutans was investigated for the anti-biofouling effect of lactobacillus fermentum (l.f.)-derived biosurfactant. it was hypothesized that two enzymes produced by s. mutans, glucosyltransferases b and c, would be inhibited by the l.f.-biosurfactant. when these two enzymes were inhibited, fewer biofilms (or none) were formed. rna was extracted from a 48-h biofilm of s. mutans formed in the presence or absence of l.f. biosurfactant, and the gene expression level of gtfb/c was quantified using the real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). l.f. biosurfactant showed substantial anti-biofouling activity because it reduced the process of attachment and biofilm production and also showed a reduction in gtfb/c gene expression (p value < 0.05).

TI  == the effect of xylitol on the composition of the oral flora: a pilot study.
AB  == objectives: our aim was to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the microbial composition of plaque and saliva. methods: twelve volunteers (22-38 yrs) harboring mutans streptococci (ms) participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. the experimental chewing gum contained 65% xylitol while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol and 2% maltitol w/w. the polyol dose was approximately 6 g/day. stimulated saliva and plaque samples were collected before and after the two four-week test periods. the samples were cultured for ms, total streptococci, lactobacilli, and total facultatives. a part of the samples were subjected to dna-dna hybridizations of 14 microbial plaque species: actinomyces naeslundii, a. viscosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. paracasei, l. rhamnose, l. plantarum, streptococcus gordonii, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, veillonella parvula. results: the ms counts of the plaque samples collected from "caries-prone" tooth sites decreased significantly (p<.01) in the  xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. also the plaque ms percentage decreased significantly in the xylitol gum group (p<.01). the salivary ms counts did not decrease either in the xylitol or in the sorbitol gum groups. nor were changes detected in the salivary levels of total streptococci or lactobacilli. the dna-dna hybridization assay revealed no study-induced changes in the microbial composition of the dental plaque. conclusions: within the limitations of this pilot study, xylitol consumption reduced ms counts in plaque  but appeared not to affect the microbial composition of plaque or saliva in general.

TI  == phylogenetic group- and species-specific oligonucleotide probes for single-cell detection of lactic acid bacteria in oral biofilms.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to design and evaluate fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) probes for the single-cell detection and enumeration of lactic acid bacteria, in particular organisms belonging to the major phylogenetic groups and species of oral lactobacilli and to abiotrophia/granulicatella. results: as lactobacilli are known for notorious resistance to probe penetration, probe-specific assay protocols were experimentally developed to provide maximum cell wall permeability, probe accessibility, hybridization stringency, and fluorescence intensity. the new assays were then applied in a pilot study to three biofilm samples harvested from variably demineralized bovine enamel discs that had been carried in situ for 10 days by different volunteers. best probe penetration and fluorescent labeling of reference strains were obtained after combined lysozyme and achromopeptidase treatment followed by exposure to lipase.  hybridization stringency had to be established strictly for each probe. thereafter all probes showed the expected specificity with reference strains and  labeled the anticipated morphotypes in dental plaques. applied to in situ grown biofilms the set of probes detected only lactobacillus fermentum and bacteria of  the lactobacillus casei group. the most cariogenic biofilm contained two orders of magnitude higher l. fermentum cell numbers than the other biofilms. abiotrophia/granulicatella and streptococci from the mitis group were found in all samples at high levels, whereas streptococcus mutans was detected in only one sample in very low numbers. conclusions: application of these new group- and species-specific fish probes to oral biofilm-forming lactic acid bacteria will allow a clearer understanding of the supragingival biome, its spatial architecture and of structure-function relationships implicated during plaque homeostasis and caries development. the probes should prove of value far beyond the field of oral microbiology, as many of them detect non-oral species and phylogenetic groups of importance in a variety of medical conditions and the food industry.

TI  == microbiota of dentinal caries as assessed by reverse-capture checkerboard analysis.
AB  == background/aims: this study aimed to identify the microbiota of different layers  of dentinal caries by using a culture-independent molecular biology approach. methods: dna was extracted from samples taken from 3 distinct layers (superficial, middle and deep) of advanced occlusal caries and analyzed for the presence and relative levels of 28 oral bacterial species/phylotypes using a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. results: the mean number of target taxa per layer was 7.7 (+/- 3.96) in the superficial, 7 (+/- 3.4) in the middle, and 6.3 (+/- 3.04) in the deep layer. no statistical significance was observed for these differences (p = 0.36). overall, the most prevalent taxa in the 3 layers were atopobium genomospecies c1 (72.5%), fusobacterium nucleatum (69%), lactobacillus casei (68%), veillonella species (55%) and lactobacillus fermentum (52%). no differences were found in the prevalence rates of the most frequent target species in the 3 layers. the most prevalent taxa found at levels  above 10(5) in the advanced front line of deep-dentin caries were atopobium genomospecies c1, f. nucleatum, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus species and veillonella species. conclusion: the present results revealed that the prevalences of several established or candidate caries pathogens do not differ significantly in the different zones of dentinal caries lesions. the finding that some as-yet-uncharacterized species and novel species were found in high frequencies join other molecular studies to include them in the set of candidate  caries pathogens.

TI  == microbial risk markers for childhood caries in pediatricians' offices.
AB  == dental caries in pre-school children has significant public health and health disparity implications. to determine microbial risk markers for this infection, this study aimed to compare the microbiota of children with early childhood caries with that of caries-free children. plaque samples from incisors, molars, and the tongue from 195 children attending pediatricians' offices were assayed by 74 dna probes and by pcr to streptococcus mutans. caries-associated factors included visible plaque, child age, race, and snacking habits. species were detected more frequently from tooth than tongue samples. lactobacillus gasseri (p < 0.01), lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus vaginalis, and s. mutans with streptococcus sobrinus (all p < 0.05) were positively associated with caries. by  multifactorial analysis, the probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus was negatively associated with caries. prevotella nigrescens was the only species (p < 0.05) significantly associated with caries by the 'false discovery' rate. analysis of the data suggests that selected lactobacillus species, in addition to mutans streptococci, are risk markers for early childhood caries.

TI  == molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
AB  == introduction: the objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. methods: samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. on the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. the isolates were determined as lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16s rdna. sequencing of 16s rdna genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies  levels. results: predominant species were lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus  plantarum, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus cellobiosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and lactobacillus gasseri were also present. the isolates lactobacillus salivarius bgho1, lactobacillus fermentum bgho36 and bgho64, lactobacillus gasseri bgho89 and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis  bgho99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus flavus, salmonella enteritidis, streptococcus  pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of candida albicans. moreover, the isolates l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 were tolerant to low ph and high concentration of bile salts. conclusion: taken together, these findings imply that l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.

TI  == caries-related plaque microcosm biofilms developed in microplates.
AB  == in vivo dental plaque biofilms consist of complex communities of oral bacteria that are a challenge to replicate in vitro. the aim of this investigation was to  establish human dental plaque microcosms in microplates to reflect conditions that are relevant to dental caries. microcosm plaque biofilms were initiated from the saliva of two different donors, grown for up to 10 days in 24-welled microplates on thermanox coverslips in various types of artificial saliva with and without sucrose, which were replaced daily. microbiota composition of 40 species associated with oral health and dental caries was monitored in the plaques using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization analysis. ph was measured as an  indicator of cariogenic potential. the composition of the saliva inocula was different, and yielded plaque microcosms with different composition and growth responses to sucrose. artificial saliva type and presence of sucrose, and the resulting growth and ph conditions, modified the growth of individual species and hence the ecological profile of the microplate plaques during development. complex population shifts were observed during development, and older plaques comprised predominantly facultative anaerobic species. sucrose supplementation limited the decline of streptococci over time but did not increase the abundance  of mutans streptococci. sucrose at 0.15% increased levels of caries-associated species including lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus and actinomyces gerensceriae; these were further increased with sucrose at 0.5%, in addition to actinomyces israelii, rothia dentocariosa and capnocytophaga gingivalis. the microplate plaques demonstrated complex community dynamics that appeared to reflect the maturation of natural plaques, and sucrose induced a cariogenic plaque composition and ph.

TI  == calcium modulates interactions between bacteria and hydroxyapatite.
AB  == bacterial adhesion onto hydroxyapatite is known to depend on the surface properties of both the biomaterial and the bacterial strain, but less is known about the influence of the composition of the aqueous medium. here, the adhesion  of streptococcus mutans and 3 different lactobacilli on powdered hydroxyapatite was shown to change with ca2+ concentration. the effect depends on the surface properties of each strain. adhesion of lactobacillus fermentum and salivarius (and of streptococcus mutans at low ca2+) was enhanced with increasing ca2+ concentration. lactobacillus casei was efficiently removed by adhesion on hydroxyapatite, even without ca2+ addition, and the effect of this ion was only marginal. the results are interpreted in terms of ca2+-mediated adhesion, and relative to the hydrophobic properties of each strain and the electrical properties of the bacterial and solid surfaces (electrophoretic mobility).

TI  == oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background/aims: lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. however, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. we aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative  oral pathogens. methods: a total of 238 lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. in all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia was assessed. results: lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. the most prevalent strains in healthy persons were lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, lactobacillus plantarum. obligately homofermentatives, particularly l. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for l. gasseri, p < 0.01). sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans, 88% a. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% p. gingivalis and 65% p. intermedia. the strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with lactobacillus paracasei, l. plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against s. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. conclusion: the composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly l. gasseri, in the latter group. both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.

AB  == oral bacterium s11 was isolated from the saliva of young children without dental  caries and with little or no visible supragingival plaque. the s11 strain showed  99.5% similarity with lactobacillus fermentum, and was identified on the basis of biochemical characteristics and a 16s rdna sequence. s11 strain and its culture supernatant significantly inhibited the formation of the insoluble glucan produced by streptococcus mutans ingbritt. s11 did not affect the multiplication  of s. mutans ingbritt, but the adherence of s. mutans ingbritt onto cuvette walls was inhibited completely.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacterial species associated with childhood caries.
AB  == although substantial epidemiologic evidence links streptococcus mutans to caries, the pathobiology of caries may involve more complex communities of bacterial species. molecular methods for bacterial identification and enumeration now make  it possible to more precisely study the microbiota associated with dental caries. the purpose of this study was to compare the bacteria found in early childhood caries (ecc) to those found in caries-free children by using molecular identification methods. cloning and sequencing of bacterial 16s ribosomal dnas from a healthy subject and a subject with ecc were used for identification of novel species or uncultivated phylotypes and species not previously associated with dental caries. ten novel phylotypes were identified. a number of species or  phylotypes that may play a role in health or disease were identified and warrant  further investigation. in addition, quantitative measurements for 23 previously known bacterial species or species groups were obtained by a reverse capture checkerboard assay for 30 subjects with caries and 30 healthy controls. significant differences were observed for nine species: s. sanguinis was associated with health and, in order of decreasing cell numbers, actinomyces gerencseriae, bifidobacterium, s. mutans, veillonella, s. salivarius, s. constellatus, s. parasanguinis, and lactobacillus fermentum were associated with  caries. these data suggest that a. gerencseriae and other actinomyces species may play an important role in caries initiation and that a novel bifidobacterium may  be a major pathogen in deep caries. further investigation could lead to the identification of targets for biological interventions in the caries process and  thereby contribute to improved prevention of and treatment for this significant public health problem.

TI  == the predominant microflora of nursing caries lesions.
AB  == the predominant microflora recovered from infected dentine of 52 carious teeth from 14 children with nursing caries was determined using both selective and non-selective media for the isolation of specific genera and acidified media (ph  5.2) to isolate the predominant aciduric microorganisms, and compared with the microflora of sound enamel surfaces in caries-free children. streptococcus mutans formed a significantly greater proportion of the lesion flora while streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus gordonii formed a significantly greater proportion of the plaque flora from sound tooth surfaces. the proportions of actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces odontolyticus were significantly greater in the plaque samples than in the lesion samples. actinomyces israelii formed 18.2% of the flora from the lesions, but was not isolated from the plaque  samples. the proportions of candida albicans, lactobacillus spp. and veillonella  spp. were also significantly greater in the carious dentine than in the plaque samples. the most frequently isolated lactobacilli were lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the predominant aciduric flora was s. oralis, s. mutans and a. israelii and these taxa were also isolated  from a similar proportion of the lesions at ph 7.0. strains of s. mutans, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. rhamnosus isolated from individual carious teeth were  genotyped using pcr-based methods. each species was genotypically heterogeneous and different genotypes were recovered from different carious teeth in the same child. these data indicate that the microflora of lesions in the same child is microbiologically diverse and support a non-specific aetiology for nursing caries in which the physiological characteristics of the infecting flora, not its composition, is the major determinant underlying the disease process.

TI  == lactobacilli in human dental caries and saliva.
AB  == samples (98 plaque and 72 saliva) from 93 patients with dental caries were investigated for lactobacillus species which comprised 65 (62.5%) of 104 isolates. yeasts (20.1%), streptococcus spp. (8.7%), staphylococcus spp. (2.9%) and a few unidentified species (5.8%), were also found. the lactobacillus isolates were l. brevis (24.6%) l. fermentum (18.5%) l. casei (16.9%), l. delbrueckii (15.4%), l. plantarum (9.23%), l. acidophilus (7.69%), l. jensenii (4.62%), l. salivarius (1.54%) and l. gasseri (1.54%). the most common species was l. brevis (24.6%). the strains tested for beta-lactamase production showed 75.4% positive. all the lactobacillus strains were tested for bacteriocin production against escherichia coli, salmonella spp., shigella dysenteriae, s. sonnei, klebsiella spp. and campylobacter sp. all the lactobacilli except l. jensenii produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. the involvement of lactobacillus in dental caries was established, although its role and mechanism is not well understood. the ability of lactobacillus spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident.

TI  == acid production from lactulose by dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == representative strains of oral streptococci, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria were incubated overnight with lactulose or other carbohydrates and the final ph recorded. most bacteria tested were able to metabolize lactulose with the exception of strains of streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus acidophilus and lact. fermentum. streptococcus mutans produced most acid overnight but the initial rate of acid production from lactulose by uninduced cultures was very low. plaque ph was monitored in 12 volunteers following rinsing the mouth with lactulose, sucrose or sorbitol or lactulose bp. these studies in vivo showed both lactulose and lactulose bp to exhibit low acidogenic potential. thus, although plaque bacteria are capable of fermenting lactulose, the results suggest that lactulose is likely to pose a small acidogenic challenge to teeth under normal conditions of use.

TI  == the effect of ph on the sensitivity of species of lactobacillus to chlorhexidine  and the antibiotics minocycline and spiramycin.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the sensitivity of a range of lactobacillus species to chlorhexidine, minocycline, and spiramycin, at a range of ph from 5.0 to 7.4. strains of streptococcus were also tested for their sensitivity to chlorhexidine, as a comparison between the genera. there were both inter- and intra-species variations in the sensitivity of these strains to chlorhexidine. the strains tested were sensitive at ph 6.7 to the following levels of chlorhexidine (micrograms/ml): l. casei (6 strains), 10-60; l. plantarum (4 strains), 40; l. fermentum (13 strains), 2-20; l. brevis (1 strain), 10; and l. acidophilus (3 strains), 10-60. the streptococcus species were sensitive to 1-4 micrograms/ml (13 strains); 4-10 micrograms/ml (3 strains); and  10-20 micrograms/ml (2 strains). one strain was able to survive 20 micrograms/ml. chlorhexidine was found to be less effective at lower ph levels. the following examples show sensitivity (micrograms/ml) at ph 6.5 followed by sensitivity at ph 5.0: l. casei (atcc 15008), 40,60; l. plantarum (ch 374), 40,100; l. fermentum (ch 324) 10,40; l. acidophilus (atcc 4356), 10,40; and s. mutans (bm 52), 2,2. all of the strains of lactobacillus tested with spiramycin were resistant at ph 5.0. minocycline was less affected by changes in ph, but at ph 7.4 lactobacillus  strains were more resistant to minocycline as compared with spiramycin. both of these antibiotics are bacteriostatic, and therefore may have a more limited effect than a bactericidal agent such as chlorhexidine. the lactobacillus strains tested required higher concentrations of chlorhexidine than did the strains of streptococcus for a killing effect in vitro.

TI  == growth inhibition of streptococcus mutans by cellular extracts of human intestinal lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro growth of streptococcus mutans was completely inhibited by water-soluble extracts from cells of various intestinal lactic acid bacteria identified as streptococcus faecium, streptococcus equinus, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus salivarius. the growth inhibition was dependent on the concentrations of the extracts. in contrast, the extracts did not inhibit the growth of the major indigenous intestinal lactic acid bacteria isolated from humans. these lactic acid bacteria were not acutely toxic in mice.

TI  == immunisation of rhesus monkeys with streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus and lipoteichoic acid for protection against dental caries.
AB  == an attempt was made to protect rhesus monkeys from dental caries by immunisation  with streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus and lipoteichoic acid (lta). the vaccine composed of s. mutans gave significant protection against caries, a decrease in the number of s. mutans, an increase in igg antibodies and a moderate increase in complement-fixing antibodies to lta. when lta was used as immunogen,  there was only a small reduction in caries, without any detectable antibodies to  lta and a slight increase in igg antibodies to cell of s. mutans. vaccines of l.  acidophilus or l. fermentum gave no protection. a combined vaccine of s. mutans and l. acidophilus did not reduce the incidence of caries but the antibody titre  to cells of s. mutans was raised to a level comparable with that in the s. mutans-immunised monkeys. the results of this investigation in a subhuman primate confirm that immunisation with s. mutans induces protection against caries, unlike the attempt to immunise with two selected strains of lactobacilli. more studies are required to establish the role of specific serotypes of lactobacilli  in the development of dental caries.

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.

TI  == interaction of streptococcus mutans glucosyltransferases with teichoic acids.
AB  == the streptococcus mutans gs5 glucosyltransferase activities (both water-soluble and -insoluble glucan-synthesizing fractions) were inhibited by purified lipoteichoic acid. in vitro sucrose-dependent colonization of smooth surfaces by  strain gs5 was also markedly reduced in the presence of the amphipathic molecules. the inhibition of soluble glucan synthesis by lipoteichoic acid appeared to be competitive with respect to both sucrose and primer dextran t10. these inhibitory effects were dependent on the presence of the fatty acid components of lipoteichoic acid since deacylated lipoteichoic acids did not inhibit glucosyltransferase activity. however, the deacylated molecules did interact with the enzymes since deacylated lipoteichoic acid partially protected  the enzyme activity against heat inactivation and also induced the formation of high-molecular-weight enzyme complexes from the soluble glucan-synthesizing fraction. the presence of teichoic acid in high-molecular-weight aggregates of glucosyltransferase isolated from the culture fluids of strain gs5 was suggested  by the detection of polyglycerophosphate in these fractions. in addition to strain gs5, two other organisms containing polyglycerophosphate teichoic acids, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus fermentum, were demonstrated to bind glucosyltransferase activity. these results are discussed relative to the potential role of teichoic acid-glucosyltransferase interactions in enzyme binding to the cell surface of s. mutans and the formation of high-molecular-weight enzyme aggregates in the culture fluids of the organism.

TI  == extractability of cell wall polysaccharide from lactobacilli and streptococci by  autoclaving and by dilue acid.
AB  == autoclaving cell wall of streptococcus mutans ingbritt for 15 min under the rantz and randall conditions released one-tenth of the total cell wall carbohydrate, whereas two-thirds was extracted after autoclaving for 180 min. the extract contained the serotype c-specific antigen but lacked the lipoteichoic acid component extracted when whole cells were autoclaved. autoclaving cell wall preparations from other strains of s. mutans and also streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis in 0.85% nacl for 180 min released the major proportion of the wall polysaccharide fraction. approximately 50 to 90% of wall carbohydrate of lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus casei was released when cell wall preparations were autoclaved in 0.85% nacl for 180 min. for wall preparations from several strains of s. mutans, autoclaving for 60 min at ph 3.75 released only 39 to 62% of wall carbohydrate, whereas almost total release could be achieved with the lactobacilli. heating s. mutans ingbritt cell wall for 24 h at  60 degrees c in 0.1 n h(2)so(4) released only two-thirds of the wall carbohydrate; by comparison nearly all of the wall carbohydrate was released in 3 h from l. casei and l. fermentum. autoclaving l. casei cell wall and purified soluble wall fractions hydrolyzed the phosphodiester bond between the polysaccharide and peptidoglycan. this was shown by the release of reactive n-acetylhexosamine in both cases and the presence of a phosphomonoester in the autoclaved soluble wall fractions. the results indicate that autoclaving can hydrolyze covalent linkages, and this must be considered when the rantz and randall procedure is used to obtain antigen preparations.

TI  == effect of growth conditions on the antigenic components of streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli.
AB  == 1) the release of lta from chemostat-grown cultures of s. mutans and l. fermentum is dependent on the generation time and ph. 2) the growth rate affects the immunogenicity of lta and the wall polysaccharide of l. fermentum. 3) the growth  of l. plantarum under glucose limitation influences the glucose content of the wall teichoic acid. the composition of the wall polysaccharide of s. mutans ingbritt may also be changed under these conditions. 4) the conditions of autoclaving used to release cell wall antigens can hydrolyse the covalent linkage between polysaccharide and peptidoglycan.

TI  == origin of esterases in human whole saliva.
AB  == whole saliva of 59 healthy persons was used for determination of esterase activity. the pattern of esterase was studied by means of isoelectrofocusing on thin-layer acrylamide gels. the esterases found in whole saliva are suggested to  be derived from the cells of the tissue in the oral cavity. this origin is indicated (e.g.) by comparison between isolectrophoretic esterase patterns of whole saliva, submandibular saliva, gingival biopsy and fibroblast culture. antisera against partially purified saliva esterases were produced in rabbits. these sera, used in immunoelectro-osmophoresis, gave esterase-active immunoprecipitate against whole saliva, the water-soluble materials of disrupted  gingival biopsy and fibroblast culture, but not against the material of the bacteria, streptococcus sanguis, strptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus and lactobacillus fermentum.

TI  == formation of extracellular lipoteichoic acid by oral streptococci and lactobacilli.
AB  == examination of the culture fluids from a number of strains of oral streptococci and latobacilli has shown the presence of an erythrocyte-sensitizing antigen with the properties of lipoteichoic acid. the antigen was isolated from the culture fluids of lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus fermentum and characterized chemically and serologically, for other strains, serological evidence for the presence of lipoteichoic acid depends on the reactivity with antiserum specific for the glycerol phosphate backbone. the relative concentrations of the antigen in culture fluids from different organisms, in culture fluids from different stages of growth, and in extracts of organisms was estimated by determining the maximum dilution that fully sensitized erythrocytes; the culture fluid titer, which is the reciprocal of the dilution, varied from 4 to 320. strains of streptococcus mutans were generally characterized by a high level of extracellular lipoteichoic acid, the amount being greater than that detectable in cell extracts; this conclusion was confirmed by using the quantitative precipitin method. a high-molecular-weight fraction obtained from s. mutans bht culture fluid was effective in sensitizing erythrocytes at a concentration of 1 mug/ml, compared with 2 mug/ml required for cellular lipoteichoic acid from l. casei. the detecting procedure depends on the teichoic acid sensitizing erythrocytes but, as shown with l. fermentum, low-molecular-weight nonsensitizing teichoic acid may also be present in culture fluid.
