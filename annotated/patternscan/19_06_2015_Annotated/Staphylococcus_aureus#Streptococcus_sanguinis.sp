TI  == antimicrobial activity of chemokine cxcl10 for dermal and oral microorganisms.
AB  == cxcl10 (ip-10) is a small 10 kda chemokine with antimicrobial activity. it is induced by ifn-gamma, chemoattracts mononuclear cells, and promotes adhesion of t cells. recently, we detected cxcl10 on the surface of the skin and in the oral cavity. in the current study, we used broth microdilution and radial diffusion assays to show that cxcl10 inhibits the growth of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, corynebacterium jeikeium, corynebacterium striatum, and candida albicans hmv4c, but not corynebacterium bovis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, poryphromonas gingivalis, or c. albicans atcc 64124. the reason for the selective antimicrobial activity is not yet known. however, antimicrobial activity of cxcl10 may be related to its composition and structure, as a cationic 98 amino acid residue molecule with 10 lysine residues,  7 arginine residues, a total net charge of +11, and a theoretical pi of 9.93. modeling studies revealed that cxcl10 contains an alpha-helix at the n-terminal,  three anti-parallel beta-strands in the middle, and an alpha-helix at the c-terminal. thus, cxcl10, when produced on the surface of the skin or in the oral cavity, likely has antimicrobial activity and may enhance innate antimicrobial and cellular responses to the presence of select commensal or opportunistic microorganisms.

TI  == platelets and infections - complex interactions with bacteria.
AB  == platelets can be considered sentinels of vascular system due to their high number in the circulation and to the range of functional immunoreceptors they express. platelets express a wide range of potential bacterial receptors, including complement receptors, fcgammarii, toll-like receptors but also integrins conventionally described in the hemostatic response, such as gpiib-iiia or gpib.  bacteria bind these receptors either directly, or indirectly via fibrinogen, fibronectin, the first complement c1q, the von willebrand factor, etc. the fate of platelet-bound bacteria is questioned. several studies reported the ability of activated platelets to internalize bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus or porphyromonas gingivalis, though there is no clue on what happens thereafter. are they sheltered from the immune system in the cytoplasm of platelets or are they lysed? indeed, while the presence of phagolysosome has not been demonstrated in platelets, they contain antimicrobial peptides that were shown to be efficient on s. aureus. besides, the fact that bacteria can bind to platelets via receptors involved in hemostasis suggests that they may induce aggregation; this has indeed been described for streptococcus sanguinis, s. epidermidis, or c. pneumoniae. on  the other hand, platelets are able to display an inflammatory response to an infectious triggering. we, and others, have shown that platelet release soluble immunomodulatory factors upon stimulation by bacterial components. moreover, interactions between bacteria and platelets are not limited to only these two partners. indeed, platelets are also essential for the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps by neutrophils, resulting in bacterial clearance by trapping  bacteria and concentrating antibacterial factors but in enhancing thrombosis. in  conclusion, the platelet-bacteria interplay is a complex game; its fine analysis  is complicated by the fact that the inflammatory component adds to the aggregation response.

TI  == antibacterial activity of berry juices, an in vitro study.
AB  == abstract objective. the aim of the present study was to evaluate in vitro antibacterial activities of blackcurrant and sea buckthorn juices on bacteria associated with gingival inflammation. materials and methods. the growth of selected bacteria (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa) was studied in vitro on agar plates. the  content of phenols in the different extracts was measured with hplc-esi-ms. results. the spectrometric analysis identified that the highest level of the single phenols studied was found for ferulic acid (113 mug/ml) in blackcurrant juice. sea buckthorn contained low levels of selected phenols. total bacterial inhibition for all bacterial species studied was found at 20% berry juice concentration with ph varying between 4.1-5.4. conclusions. the present study identified that in vitro bacterial growth on agar plates was inhibited by blackcurrant and sea buckthorn juices and that low juice ph explains bacterial in vitro growth. this may have clinical implications in biofilm development, reducing the risks for both tooth decay and gingivitis.

TI  == introducing a semi-coated model to investigate antibacterial effects of biocompatible polymers on titanium surfaces.
AB  == peri-implant infections from bacterial biofilms on artificial surfaces are a common threat to all medical implants. they are a handicap for the patient and can lead to implant failure or even life-threatening complications. new implant surfaces have to be developed to reduce biofilm formation and to improve the long-term prognosis of medical implants. the aim of this study was (1) to develop a new method to test the antibacterial efficacy of implant surfaces by direct surface contact and (2) to elucidate whether an innovative antimicrobial copolymer coating of 4-vinyl-n-hexylpyridinium bromide and dimethyl(2-methacryloyloxyethyl) phosphonate (vp:dmmep 30:70) on titanium is able to reduce the attachment of bacteria prevalent in peri-implant infections. with a new in vitro model with semi-coated titanium discs, we were able to show a dramatic reduction in the adhesion of various pathogenic bacteria (streptococcus  sanguinis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis),  completely independently of effects caused by soluble materials. in contrast, soft tissue cells (human gingival or dermis fibroblasts) were less affected by the same coating, despite a moderate reduction in initial adhesion of gingival fibroblasts. these data confirm the hypothesis that vp:dmmep 30:70 is a promising antibacterial copolymer that may be of use in several clinical applications.

TI  == the innate defense antimicrobial peptides hbd3 and rnase7 are induced in human umbilical vein endothelial cells by classical inflammatory cytokines but not th17 cytokines.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides are multifunctional effector molecules of innate immunity. in this study we investigated whether endothelial cells actively contribute to innate defense mechanisms by expression of antimicrobial peptides. we therefore stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvec) with inflammatory cytokines, th17 cytokines, heat-inactivated bacteria, bacterial conditioned medium (bcm) of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus sanguinis, and lipoteichoic acid (lta). stimulation with single cytokines induced discrete expression of human beta-defensin 3 (hbd3) by ifn-gamma or il-1beta and of ribonuclease 7 (rnase7) by tnf-alpha without any effects on ll-37 gene expression. stronger hbd3 and rnase7 induction was observed after combined stimulation with il-1beta, tnf-alpha and ifn-gamma and was confirmed by high hbd3 and rnase7 peptide levels in cell culture supernatants. in contrast, th17 cytokines or stimulation with lta did not result in amp production. moreover, only bcm of an invasive s. aureus bacteremia isolate induced hbd3 in huvec. we conclude that endothelial cells actively contribute to prevent dissemination of pathogens at the blood-tissue-barrier by production of amps that exhibit microbicidal and immunomodulatory functions. further investigations should focus  on tissue-specific amp induction in different endothelial cell types, on pathogen-specific induction patterns and potentially involved pattern-recognition receptors of endothelial cells.

TI  == in vitro activity of linezolid as assessed through the 2013 leader surveillance program.
AB  == the 2013 leader surveillance program monitored the in vitro activity of linezolid and comparator agents against gram-positive bacteria at 60 medical centers in the united states. a total of 7183 pathogens were contributed from 6 predetermined pathogen groups. the groups were staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans group streptococci. the mic90 value for each of the 6  pathogen groups was 1 mug/ml. susceptibility of "all organisms" to linezolid was  99.83%. only 12 isolates (2 s. aureus, 3 staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 streptococcus sanguinis, 5 enterococcus faecium, and 1 enterococcus faecalis) were nonsusceptible to linezolid (0.17%). three of these (2 s. aureus and 1 e. faecium) harbored the cfr resistance mechanism. the findings indicate that linezolid activity remains stable, although there are examples of clonal dissemination within several monitored institutions.

TI  == collagen barrier membranes may accelerate bacterial growth in vitro: a potential  clinical risk to regenerative procedures.
AB  == objectives: evaluate the antibacterial properties of three commercial collagen membranes for guided bone regeneration (gbr). method and materials: biogide(r), osseoguard(r), and copios(r) membranes were tested for antibacterial properties against streptococcus sanguinis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis using a direct contact test (dct). samples of each membrane, sized 5  x 2 mm, were fixed to the side wall of 6 wells in a 96-well microtiter plate. bacterial suspension was placed on each sample. the plate was incubated at 37 degrees c for 1 hour to allow suspension fluid evaporation. fresh medium was added to each well and the plate was mixed. non-contaminated membrane samples served as negative control. bacterial growth was monitored spectrophotometrically at 650 nm for 24 hours. anova and tukey's comparison tests were used for the statistical analysis. results: the presence of the membrane samples did not disrupt bacterial growth. however, the presence of osseoguard membrane accelerated bacterial growth rate of s sanguinis and s epidermidis as compared to the other two membranes and control samples (p < .001), and of s aureus as compared to the control alone (p < .001). conclusions: the tested collagen membranes have no antibacterial properties. however, osseoguard presents a significant bacterial growth enhancement effect with possible significant clinical implications on the success of regenerative procedures around teeth and  implants.

TI  == susceptibility of methacrylate-based root canal filling to degradation by bacteria found in endodontic infections.
AB  == objectives: to present a case of endodontic failure obturated with a methacrylate-based root filling material, resilon/realseal (rs). to determine if  rs is susceptible to biodegradation by endodontically relevant microbes by a method known to show rs degradation. method and materials: emulsions of rs were dispersed in agar with minimal bacterial nutrients in culture plates. lipase ps served as a positive control. pseudomonas aeruginosa, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis were tested for their ability to biodegrade rs. the bacteria were inoculated in the plates and examined daily for rs degradation for 7 days. results: degradation of the emulsified rs manifested in the formation of clear zones around p aeruginosa, p intermedia, p asaccharolytica, s aureus, and s epidermidis. no degradation was seen with the other tested bacteria or in plates that did not contain rs emulsion. conclusion:  endodontic pathogenic bacteria can degrade rs. these findings complement other work and suggest that the seal and integrity of root canal fillings obturated with rs may be impaired by a microbial insult.

TI  == effective release of a broad spectrum antibiotic from elastin-like polypeptide-collagen composite.
AB  == preparation of hydrogels that possess an effective antibiotic release profile and better mechanical properties compared to the traditionally used collagen hydrogels has the potential to minimize post-surgical infections and support wound healing. toward this goal, we prepared elastin-like polypeptide (elp)-collagen composite hydrogels that displayed a significantly higher elastic  modulus compared to the collagen hydrogels. we then characterized the release behavior of the collagen and elp-collagen hydrogels loaded with varying dosages (1-5% w/w) of a commonly used broad spectrum antibiotic, doxycycline hyclate. both collagen and elp-collagen hydrogels showed a gradual time dependent doxycycline release over a period of 5 days. the elp-collagen hydrogels, in general, showed a slower release of the doxycycline compared to the collagen hydrogels. the released doxycycline was found to be effective against four bacterial strains (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus sanguinis, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus) in a dose dependent manner. combined with their improved mechanical properties, the gradual and effective drug release from the biocompatible elp-collagen hydrogels shown here may be beneficial for drug delivery and tissue engineering applications.

TI  == amplification of bacteria-induced platelet activation is triggered by fcgammariia, integrin alphaiibbeta3, and platelet factor 4.
AB  == bacterial adhesion to platelets is mediated via a range of strain-specific bacterial surface proteins that bind to a variety of platelet receptors. it is unclear how these interactions lead to platelet activation. we demonstrate a critical role for the immune receptor fcgammariia, alphaiibbeta3, and src and syk tyrosine kinases in platelet activation by staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus pneumoniae. fcgammariia activation is dependent on immunoglobulin g (igg) and alphaiibbeta3 engagement. moreover, feedback agonists adenosine 5'-diphosphate and thromboxane a2 are mandatory for platelet aggregation. additionally, platelet factor 4 (pf4) binds to bacteria and reduces the lag time for aggregation, and gray platelet syndrome alpha-granule-deficient platelets do not aggregate to 4 of 5 bacterial strains. we propose that fcgammariia-mediated activation is a common  response mechanism used against a wide range of bacteria, and that release of secondary mediators and pf4 serve as a positive feedback mechanism for activation through an igg-dependent pathway.

TI  == an assessment of the effectiveness of mechanical and chemical cleaning of essix orthodontic retainer.
AB  == objectives: to determine the effectiveness of mechanical and chemical cleaning on the removal of microorganisms from essix orthodontic retainers. design: in vitro  laboratory study. setting: department of orthodontics and microbiology, eastman dental institute, university college london, uk. methods: study 1: 120 essix retainers were divided into four cleaning groups. the effectiveness of each cleaning method to remove a single species biofilm of streptococcus mutans from the retainer was assessed. study 2: 140 essix retainers were divided into four study groups (brushing with fluoride toothpaste, chlorhexidine gel, immersion in  chlorhexidine solution only and a control) to investigate the chemical and mechanical cleaning of the multispecies biolfilm of (streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans). relevant results: in study 1, brushing with toothpaste resulted in 99% reduction of streptococcus mutans. in study 2, all three cleaning methods recorded similarly statistically significant reductions in colony forming units per millilitre compared to the control. there were no statistically significant differences between any of the cleaning groups for any of the microorganisms except mrsa-16. for mrsa-16, chlorhexidine mouthwash and gel were significantly more potent in eliminating the microorganism than the fluoride toothpaste. conclusions: all three cleaning methods effectively removed 99% of microorganisms from the essix retainers. brushing with fluoride toothpaste can therefore be confirmed as an effective method for cleaning retainers in most circumstances. the use of chlorhexidine gel or mouthwash is recommended in patients where bacterial infection has to be avoided due to immunosuppression or other reasons.

TI  == [evaluation of biocidal properties of silver nanoparticles against cariogenic bacteria].
AB  == introduction: antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles (snp's) have been  recentl well evaluated, and now are being considered as excellent candidates for  therapeutic purposes. it is confirmed, that various solutions of colloidal snp's  possess significant antibacterial properties against such species as: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas  aeruginosa even at low concentrations, although there have been so far only a few researches evaluating antimicrobial activity of snp's against cariogenic bacteria: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis  responsible for initiation of dental carries. tooth decay is infectious disease an worldwide, which may occur in patients of every age. nanotechnology creates a  new approach of designing of medical devices preventing or reducing bacterial colonization. methods: colloidal silver solution (css) of concentration 350 ppm was used in this research. nanoparticles size, shape and solution stability were  evaluated. 16 strains of cariogenic bacteria, 4 isolates of each species: s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis and s, mitis were obtained from plaque swabs  of 7 patients treated for dental carries at department of conservative dentistry, medical university of warsaw. mic and mbc values for css's were evaluated. results: css used in this research is of good stability. no agglomeration or coalescence was observed during 24 hours of experiment. silver nanoparticles were of round shape and had mean size of 67 nm. mic values were: 12-25 ppm for s. salivarius, 25 ppm for s. sanguinis, 50-100 ppm for s. mitis and 50 ppm for s. mutans, while mbc values after 1 hour of bacterial contact with nanoparticles were 200-350 ppm for all cariogenic bacterial species. after 24 hours of contact  mbc values were: 25-50 ppm for s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, 100-200 ppm for s. mitis and 200 ppmfor s. mutans. conclusions: antimicrobial properties of css depend on nanoparticles concentration and interaction time with bacteria. the susceptibility of cariogenic oral streptococci to silver nanoparticles is diversified. sufficient concentration which inhibited all cariogenic bacteria in  our research was 200 ppm after long (24 hours) period of silver nanoparticles interaction with bacteria.

TI  == novel bacteriophage lysin with broad lytic activity protects against mixed infection by streptococcus pyogenes and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus [gras]) cause serious and sometimes fatal human diseases.  they are among the many gram-positive pathogens for which resistance to leading antibiotics has emerged. as a result, alternative therapies need to be developed  to combat these pathogens. we have identified a novel bacteriophage lysin (plyss2), derived from a streptococcus suis phage, with broad lytic activity against mrsa, vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (visa), streptococcus suis, listeria, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus equi, streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus [gbs]), s. pyogenes, streptococcus sanguinis, group g streptococci (ggs), group e streptococci (ges),  and streptococcus pneumoniae. plyss2 has an n-terminal cysteine-histidine aminopeptidase (chap) catalytic domain and a c-terminal sh3b binding domain. it is stable at 50 degrees c for 30 min, 37 degrees c for >24 h, 4 degrees c for 15  days, and -80 degrees c for >7 months; it maintained full activity after 10 freeze-thaw cycles. plyss2 at 128 mug/ml in vitro reduced mrsa and s. pyogenes growth by 5 logs and 3 logs within 1 h, respectively, and exhibited a mic of 16 mug/ml for mrsa. a single, 2-mg dose of plyss2 protected 92% (22/24) of the mice  in a bacteremia model of mixed mrsa and s. pyogenes infection. serially increasing exposure of mrsa and s. pyogenes to plyss2 or mupirocin resulted in no observed resistance to plyss2 and resistance to mupirocin. to date, no other lysin has shown such notable broad lytic activity, stability, and efficacy against multiple, leading, human bacterial pathogens; as such, plyss2 has all the characteristics to be an effective therapeutic.

TI  == suppuration-associated bacteria in patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: suppuration (sup) on probing may be an indication of active periodontal breakdown. the aim of the present study is to analyze which subgingival species are associated with sup in patients with chronic (cp) and aggressive (agp) periodontitis. methods: a total of 156 patients with cp and 66 with agp were submitted to full-mouth periodontal examination and subgingival biofilm sampling (14 sites/patient). the counts of 44 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard. comparisons between groups and sites were analyzed by the mann-whitney and wilcoxon tests, respectively. associations between frequency of sup and bacterial species were analyzed by the spearman correlation coefficient. results: the prevalence of sup in patients with cp was 24.4%, and in patients with agp it was 30.3%, and the percentage of sup sites in the groups was 5.72% +/- 1.06% and 6.96% +/- 1.70%, respectively (p >0.05). sup sites from patients with cp had significantly higher counts of veillonella parvula, dialister pneumosintes, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella nigrescens than sup  sites from patients with agp (p <0.005). significant positive correlations between high frequency of sup and high levels of actinomyces spp, streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were observed in patients with cp (p <0.05). in patients with agp, actinomyces oris, propionibacterium acnes, p. aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  and streptococcus sanguinis were positively associated with sup, whereas prevotella intermedia presented a negative association with sup (p <0.05). conclusions: sup sites from patients with cp harbored significantly higher counts of several periodontal species than sup sites from patients with agp. actinomyces spp., streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, t. forsythia, and certain non-oral pathogens were associated with a high number of sites with sup.

TI  == genome-wide essential gene identification in streptococcus sanguinis.
AB  == a clear perception of gene essentiality in bacterial pathogens is pivotal for identifying drug targets to combat emergence of new pathogens and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, for synthetic biology, and for understanding the origins of life. we have constructed a comprehensive set of deletion mutants and  systematically identified a clearly defined set of essential genes for streptococcus sanguinis. our results were confirmed by growing s. sanguinis in minimal medium and by double-knockout of paralogous or isozyme genes. careful examination revealed that these essential genes were associated with only three basic categories of biological functions: maintenance of the cell envelope, energy production, and processing of genetic information. our finding was subsequently validated in two other pathogenic streptococcal species, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans and in two other gram-positive  pathogens, bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus. our analysis has thus led to a simplified model that permits reliable prediction of gene essentiality.

TI  == novel bacterial lipoprotein structures conserved in low-gc content gram-positive  bacteria are recognized by toll-like receptor 2.
AB  == bacterial lipoproteins/lipopeptides inducing host innate immune responses are sensed by mammalian toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2). these bacterial lipoproteins are structurally divided into two groups, diacylated or triacylated lipoproteins, by  the absence or presence of an amide-linked fatty acid. the presence of diacylated lipoproteins has been predicted in low-gc content gram-positive bacteria and mycoplasmas based on the absence of one modification enzyme in their genomes; however, we recently determined triacylated structures in low-gc gram-positive staphylococcus aureus, raising questions about the actual lipoprotein structure in other low-gc content gram-positive bacteria. here, through intensive ms analyses, we identified a novel and unique bacterial lipoprotein structure containing an n-acyl-s-monoacyl-glyceryl-cysteine (named the lyso structure) from low-gc gram-positive enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, streptococcus sanguinis, and lactobacillus bulgaricus. two of the purified native lyso-form lipoproteins induced proinflammatory cytokine production from mice macrophages in a tlr2-dependent and tlr1-independent manner but with a different dependence on tlr6. additionally, two other new lipoprotein structures were identified. one is  the "n-acetyl" lipoprotein structure containing n-acetyl-s-diacyl-glyceryl-cysteine, which was found in five gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus subtilis. the n-acetyl lipoproteins induced the proinflammatory cytokines through the tlr2/6 heterodimer. the other was identified in a mycoplasma strain and is an unusual diacyl lipoprotein structure  containing two amino acids before the lipid-modified cysteine residue. taken together, our results suggest the existence of novel tlr2-stimulating lyso and n-acetyl forms of lipoproteins that are conserved in low-gc content gram-positive bacteria and provide clear evidence for the presence of yet to be identified key  enzymes involved in the bacterial lipoprotein biosynthesis.

TI  == potential infectious etiology of behcet's disease.
AB  == behcet's disease is a multisystem inflammatory disorder characterized by recurrent oral aphthous ulcers, genital ulcers, uveitis, and skin lesions. the cause of behcet's disease remains unknown, but epidemiologic findings suggest that an autoimmune process is triggered by an environmental agent in a genetically predisposed individual. an infectious agent could operate through molecular mimicry, and subsequently the disease could be perpetuated by an abnormal immune response to an autoantigen in the absence of ongoing infection. potentia bacterial are saccharomyces cerevisiae, mycobacteria, borrelia burgdorferi, helicobacter pylori, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and mycoplasma fermentans, but the most commonly investigated microorganism is streptococcus sanguinis. the relationship between streptococcal infections and behcet's disease is suggested by clinical observations that an unhygienic oral condition is frequently noted in the oral cavity of behcet's disease patients. several viral agents, including herpes simplex virus-1, hepatitis c virus, parvovirus b19, cytomegalovirus, epstein-barr virus and varicella zoster virus, may also have some role.

TI  == antibacterial activity of sphingoid bases and fatty acids against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == there is growing evidence that the role of lipids in innate immunity is more important than previously realized. how lipids interact with bacteria to achieve  a level of protection, however, is still poorly understood. to begin to address the mechanisms of antibacterial activity, we determined mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of lipids common to the skin and oral cavity--the sphingoid bases d-sphingosine, phytosphingosine, and dihydrosphingosine and the fatty acids sapienic acid and lauric acid--against four gram-negative bacteria and seven gram-positive bacteria. exact kruskal-wallis tests of these values showed differences among lipid treatments (p < 0.0001) for each bacterial species except serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa. d-sphingosine (mbc range, 0.3 to 19.6 mug/ml), dihydrosphingosine (mbc range, 0.6 to 39.1 mug/ml), and phytosphingosine (mbc range, 3.3 to 62.5 mug/ml) were active against all bacteria except s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa (mbc > 500 mug/ml). sapienic acid (mbc range, 31.3 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, and fusobacterium nucleatum but not active against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa, corynebacterium bovis, corynebacterium striatum, and corynebacterium  jeikeium (mbc > 500 mug/ml). lauric acid (mbc range, 6.8 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against all bacteria except e. coli, s. marcescens, and p. aeruginosa (mbc > 500 mug/ml). complete killing was achieved as early as 0.5 h for some lipids but took as long as 24 h for others. hence, sphingoid bases and fatty acids have  different antibacterial activities and may have potential for prophylactic or therapeutic intervention in infection.

TI  == synthesis, antimicrobial and antiproliferative activity of novel silver(i) tris(pyrazolyl)methanesulfonate and 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphadamantane complexes.
AB  == five new silver(i) complexes of formulas [ag(tpms)] (1), [ag(tpms)(pph(3))] (2),  [ag(tpms)(pcy(3))] (3), [ag(pta)][bf(4)] (4), and [ag(tpms)(pta)] (5) {tpms = tris(pyrazol-1-yl)methanesulfonate, pph(3) = triphenylphosphane, pcy(3) = tricyclohexylphosphane, pta = 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane} have been synthesized and fully characterized by elemental analyses, (1)h, (13)c, and (31)p nmr, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (esi-ms), and ir spectroscopic techniques. the single crystal x-ray diffraction study of 3 shows the tpms ligand acting in the n(3)-facially coordinating mode, while in 2 and 5 a n(2)o-coordination is found, with the so(3) group bonded to silver and a pendant  free pyrazolyl ring. features of the tilting in the coordinated pyrazolyl rings in these cases suggest that this inequivalence is related with the cone angles of the phosphanes. a detailed study of antimycobacterial and antiproliferative properties of all compounds has been carried out. they were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activities against the standard strains enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29922), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923), streptococcus pneumoniae (atcc  49619), streptococcus pyogenes (sf37), streptococcus sanguinis (sk36), streptococcus mutans (ua159), escherichia coli (atcc 25922), and the fungus candida albicans (atcc 24443). complexes 1-5 have been found to display effective antimicrobial activity against the series of bacteria and fungi, and some of them are potential candidates for antiseptic or disinfectant drugs. interaction of ag  complexes with deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) has been studied by fluorescence spectroscopic techniques, using ethidium bromide (eb) as a fluorescence probe of  dna. the decrease in the fluorescence of dna-eb system on addition of ag complexes shows that the fluorescence quenching of dna-eb complex occurs and compound 3 is particularly active. complexes 1-5 exhibit pronounced antiproliferative activity against human malignant melanoma (a375) with an activity often higher than that of agno(3), which has been used as a control, following the same order of activity inhibition on dna, i.e., 3 > 2 > 1 > 5 > agno(3)>> 4.

TI  == antibacterial and antifungal activities of punica granatum peel extracts against  oral pathogens.
AB  == objective: punica granatum has been used for many years in folk medicine due to several purposes. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of methanolic extract of punica granatum peel (mepgp) against streptococcus mutans,  staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguinis, staphylococcus epidermidis, actynomyces viscosus, lactobacillus acidophilus and candida albicans. materials and methods: in this in vitro study, the mentioned oral organisms were cultured in blood agar and mueller-hinton media and then paper disks containing mepgp at concentrations of 4 mg/ml, 8 mg/ml and 12 mg/ml were inserted on medias. the antimicrobial activity was evaluated by agar disk diffusion method. the effects of three different concentrations of mepgp against  microorganisms were compared using one-way anova and tukey tests. results: all concentrations of mepgp had antibacterial activity against s. aureus and s. epidermidis. only at concentration of 8 mg/ml and 12 mg/ml mepgp was effective against l. acidophilus, s. mutans and s. salivarius. furthermore; no concentrations of mepgp inhibited a. viscosus and c. albicans. conclusion: this study suggests that mepgp might be used as an antibacterial agent in controlling  oral infections.

TI  == fibrin- and collagen-based matrices attenuate inflammatory and procoagulant responses in human endothelial cell cultures exposed to staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == infective endocarditis (ie) remains a serious complication after heart valve replacement. autologous valves constructed by matrix-based tissue engineering are under investigation to increase biocompatibility. the impact of the underlying matrix on the risk to develop ie is not known. the ie is characterized by bacterial adhesion and subsequent interactions of disseminating bacteria with endothelial cells (ecs) and monocytes, evoking endothelial proinflammatory and procoagulant activity, leading to heart valve destruction. in the current study,  we, therefore, have seeded human ecs on a fibrin versus collagen gel matrix and,  at confluence, infected them with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sanguis, and staphylococcus epidermidis. especially sta. aureus infected ecs grown on fibrin (4.2% of the inoculum) and collagen (3.7%) matrices, more than on ecs grown on noncoated plates (1.2%; p<0.01). this was associated with higher monocyte adhesion (61%; p<0.01 on fibrin and 43%; p<0.05 on collagen) versus control cultures (30%), even at comparable ec surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular adhesion molecule-1. the collagen matrix attenuated the sta. aureus-induced monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 expression  2.0-fold, compared with the noncoated control ecs. this reduction coincided with  a 4.2-5.0-fold reduction of the procoagulant activity, triggered in ecs grown on  noncoated wells, as a consequence of tissue factor (tf) expression by ecs, further stimulated by ec-bound monocytes. overall, moderate responses were seen on infection with str. sanguis and sta. epidermidis for both gel matrices. thus,  even when fibrin and collagen gel matrices equally increase bacterial adhesion, and subsequent monocyte adhesion to infected ecs, these matrices modulate ec responses to these stimuli, thus resulting in attenuated cytokine production and  attenuated adherent monocyte-dependent tf production by the ecs. further investigations will need to confirm whether also in vivo, ec-matrix interactions  can attenuate ec responses to bacteria and inflammatory cells to reduce ie at infected endovascular sites.

TI  == reduced-oxidized difference spectral analysis and chemiluminescence-based scatchard analysis demonstrate selective binding of myeloperoxidase to microbes.
AB  == myeloperoxidase (mpo), a microbicidal haloperoxidase of neutrophil leukocytes, was observed to selectively bind to bacteria. binding was quantified by dithionite-reduced minus oxidized (r-o) difference spectral analysis. escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed large mpo binding by r-o difference spectral analysis, whereas streptococcus sanguinis did not. for increased sensitivity, free and microbe-bound mpo and chloroperoxidase (cpo) activities were quantified by acid-optimum haloperoxidase-dependent chemiluminescence (cl) measurements, and these data were used for scatchard analysis. the mpo bound/free (b/f) cl ratio was 49.5 for p. aeruginosa, 14.6 for staphylococcus aureus, 2.8 for e. coli, 0.7 for candida albicans and 0.4 for s. sanguinis. by comparison, the cpo b/f cl ratio was 0.03 for p. aeruginosa, 0.09 for s. aureus, 0.31 for e.  coli, 0.18 for c. albicans and 0.16 for s. sanguinis. as a member of the lactic acid family of bacteria and a viridans streptococcus, s. sanguinis does not synthesize cytochromes and is catalase-negative. the metabolic products of s. sanguinis, i.e. lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide, provide optimal acidity and substrate for mpo oxidation of chloride to hypochlorite. hypochlorite can react with organic substrates to yield dehydrogenated or chlorinated products, but when peroxide is not limiting, hypochlorite reacts with peroxide yielding singlet oxygen. the reactivity of hypochlorite is dependent on substrate availability. the microsecond half-life of electronically excited singlet oxygen restricts reactivity to within a radius of <0.25 microm; i.e. the reactivity of singlet oxygen is both substrate and half-life dependent. poor mpo binding provides protection and possibly competitive advantage to viridans streptococci.

TI  == microflora in maxillofacial infections--a changing scenario?
AB  == purpose: advances in isolation and culturing techniques have brought the role of  anaerobic bacteria-causing maxillofacial infections to the fore. recent literature also favors the role of anaerobes in maxillofacial infections. a prospective clinical and microbiological study was designed to check the validity of such claims. patients and methods: this study included 88 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. pus was obtained by aspirating the involved spaces and culture and sensitivity tests were performed to determine the microbes involved and their sensitivity to various antibiotics. results: upon isolating the various organisms causing infection, it was found that 68.2% were aerobes, 13.6% were mixed infections, and 9.1% were anaerobes. streptococcus and peptostreptococcus species were the most common among aerobes and anaerobes, respectively. on determining sensitivity to penicillin, 81.3% were sensitive and  18.8% were resistant. coagulase-negative staphylococcus and staphylococcus aureus were predominantly resistant to penicillin. conclusion: analysis of the results indicated no change in microflora-causing infections in the maxillofacial region  and penicillin remains the drug of choice in treating these infections.

TI  == myeloperoxidase selectively binds and selectively kills microbes.
AB  == myeloperoxidase (mpo) is reported to selectively bind to bacteria. the present study provides direct evidence of mpo binding selectivity and tests the relationship of selective binding to selective killing. the microbicidal effectiveness of h(2)o(2) and of ocl(-) was compared to that of mpo plus h(2)o(2). synergistic microbicidal action was investigated by combining streptococcus sanguinis, a h(2)o(2)-producing microbe showing low mpo binding, with high-mpo-binding escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, or pseudomonas aeruginosa without exogenous h(2)o(2), with and without mpo, and with and without erythrocytes (red blood cells [rbcs]). selectivity of mpo microbicidal action was conventionally measured as the mpo mic and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) for 82 bacteria including e. coli, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and viridans streptococci. both h(2)o(2) and ocl(-) destroyed rbcs at submicrobicidal concentrations. nanomolar concentrations of mpo increased h(2)o(2) microbicidal action 1,000-fold. streptococci plus mpo produced potent synergistic microbicidal action against all microbes tested, and rbcs caused only a small decrease in potency without erythrocyte damage. mpo directly killed h(2)o(2)-producing s. pyogenes but was ineffective against non-h(2)o(2)-producing e. faecalis. the mpo  mics and mbcs for e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus were significantly lower  than those for e. faecalis. the streptococcal studies showed much higher mic/mbc  results, but such testing required lysed horse blood-supplemented medium, thus preventing valid comparison of these results to those for the other microbes. e.  faecalis mpo binding is reportedly weak compared to binding of e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus but strong compared to binding of streptococci. selective mpo binding results in selective killing.

TI  == in vitro oral biofilm formation on triclosan-coated sutures in the absence and presence of additional antiplaque treatment.
AB  == purpose: this study evaluated the in vitro plaque inhibitory effect of triclosan-coated polyglactin 910 sutures in the absence and presence of an additional antiplaque agent commonly used after oral surgery. materials and methods: triclosan-coated sutures were incubated for 4 hours in freshly collected human saliva and, when appropriate, subsequently treated with an antiplaque rinse containing chlorhexidine-cetyl pyridinium as active components. sutures without a triclosan-coating served as a control. results: triclosan-coated sutures harbored similar amounts of plaque as did uncoated sutures. exposure to the antiplaque rinse caused significant decreases in viable organisms for uncoated and triclosan-coated sutures. however, after application of the antiplaque rinse, more micro-organisms were found on triclosan-coated than on uncoated sutures. conclusion: sutures coated with triclosan do not provide a sufficient antimicrobial effect to prevent in vitro colonization by oral bacteria, whereas use in combination with a chlorhexidine-cetyl pyridinium-containing antiplaque rinse appears to be counterproductive.

TI  == decontamination efficacy of antiseptic agents on in vivo grown biofilms on rough  titanium surfaces.
AB  == objective: four common antimicrobial agents were evaluated for their efficacy in  reduction of aerobic bacteria intraorally grown in biofilms on rough titanium samples. the solutions investigated contained chlorhexidine, essential oil, octenidine, or citric acid. method and materials: twenty volunteers wore splints  with titanium sleeves intraorally for 10 days. following irrigation with the antiseptics, the sleeves were removed and biofilm samples were taken by swabbing. the bacteria were first examined microscopically by gram staining. these samples  from the surfaces were then cultured under aerobic conditions to identify and quantify the colonizing bacteria. results: compared to untreated controls, significant (p < .05) differences in antimicrobial efficacy were observed for the different regimens depending on bacterial species or even the subtype. the reduction rates achieved varied from 30.0% after 2 minutes of rinsing with chlorhexidine to 99.8% after 8 minutes of rinsing with octenidine. conclusion: the irrigation regimens studied in this investigation reduced bacterial colonization in a mature biofilm grown intraorally on rough titanium surfaces. the highest absolute reduction was achieved after 8 minutes, but only the 2-minute reduction rates are significant for clinical practice. taking this into  consideration, the distinct decontamination efficacy of octenidine and citric acid is evident.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine if varying the percent (by weight) of  aqueous calcium hydroxide or using different vehicles had an effect on its antibacterial efficacy against common endodontic pathogens in a pour plate/traditional streak agar diffusion model. mixtures of calcium hydroxide powder and sterile saline in 40, 50 and 60 percent concentrations and the commercial preparations ultracal xs and vitapex were tested against six known endodontic pathogens with an agar diffusion method. each medicament was placed in one of five wells, in each of 10 agar plates (n = 10), for cultures of each bacterial species. zones of inhibition were measured after 48 hours incubation for aerobes and 96 hours incubation for anaerobes. multiple one-way analyses of variance and post-hoc student neuman keuls evaluated the data at alpha = 0.05. larger zones of inhibition were consistently observed for higher concentrations of calcium hydroxide with statistical significance among the bacteria, particularly between 40% and 60%. vitapex had significantly smaller zones of inhibition than all other medicaments and 35% ultracal xs with methylcellulose was nearly as effective as 50% ca(oh)(2) in inhibitory activity. formulations containing 50-60% ca(oh)(2) or 35% ca(oh)(2) with aqueous methylcellulose are recommended as endodontic interappointment medicaments.

TI  == a quantitative approach to the effectiveness of ozone against microbiota organisms colonizing toothbrushes.
AB  == objectives: toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. this can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. in this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. methods: fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. microorganisms were enumerated and identified. bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated pbs solution  for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. results: counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) cfu. candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. no obligate anaerobes were isolated. members of streptococcaceae family were regularly found  (65.2%) belonging to the following species: streptococcus pyogenes, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. sobrinus, s. viridans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, aerococcus viridans. a. viridans and s. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis were found on adults  brushes. escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp. and enterococcus sp., were also recovered. we found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. however, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. conclusions: ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.

TI  == review. leukocyte and endothelial cell adhesion molecules in inflammation focusing on inflammatory heart disease.
AB  == in multicellular organisms the development of adhesion bonds, either among cells  or among cells and components of the extracellular matrix, is a crucial process.  these interactions are mediated by molecules which are named adhesion molecules and play a main role both at the early stages of the development of tissue integrity and later. cell adhesion molecules (cams) have a key role in several pathologies such as cancer and inflammatory diseases. selectins, integrins and immunoglobulin gene superfamily of adhesion receptors mediate different steps of  leukocyte migration from the bloodstream towards the inflammatory foci. leukocyte interactions with the vascular endothelium are highly orchestrated processes that include the capture of free-flowing leukocytes from the blood with subsequent leukocyte rolling, arrest, firm adhesion and ensuing diapedesis. these interactions occur under high shear stresses within venules and depend on multiple families of adhesion molecules. as a response to infection mediators, leukocyte gathering is considered to be crucial for the adequate defence of the organism to any kind of injury or infection. endothelial activation contributes significantly to the systemic inflammatory response to bacteraemia and increased  expression. release of soluble endothelial markers into the circulation has been  demonstrated together with elevated plasma levels of cams and has been reported in bacteraemic patients. it has been proposed that infection of endothelial cells with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sanguis, or staphylococcus epidermidis  induces surface expression of icam-1 and vcam-1 and monocyte adhesion. in general, leukocyte/endothelial cell interactions such as capture, rolling, and firm adhesion can no longer be viewed as occurring in discrete steps mediated by  individual families of adhesion molecules but rather as a series of overlapping synergistic interactions among adhesion molecules resulting in an adhesion cascade. these cascades thereby direct leukocyte migration, which is essential for the generation of effective inflammatory responses and the development of rapid immune responses.

AB  == background: measuring heat from replicating microorganisms in culture may be a rapid, accurate, and simple screening method for platelets (plts). microcalorimetry for detection of microorganisms in in vitro contaminated plt products was evaluated. study design and methods: staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sanguinis, escherichia coli, propionibacterium acnes, and candida albicans were inoculated in single-donor apheresis plts to achieve target concentrations of 10(5), 10(3), 10, or 1 colony-forming units (cfu) per ml of plts. contaminated plts in growth medium were incubated at 37 degrees c for 5 days in a calorimeter. positivity was defined as heat flow of at least 10 microw above the lowest value of the power-time curve. results: with microcalorimetry, inocula of 10 cfus per ml plts  could be detected with the following detection times: s. epidermidis (31.65 hr),  s. aureus (24.24 hr), s. sanguinis (7.82 hr), e. coli (7.53 hr), p. acnes (73.57  hr), and c. albicans (43.77 hr). the detection time was less than 4 hr at 10(5) cfus per ml plts for s. aureus, s. sanguinis, and e. coli. noncontaminated plts remained negative. the total heat ranged from 2.8 (s. sanguinis) to 8.3 j (e. coli). the shape of the power-time curve was species-specific and independent from the initial concentration of microorganisms. conclusion: the detection limit of microcalorimetry was 1 to 10 cfus per ml plts. microcalorimetry is a promising novel method for detection of contaminated plts. applying this method to all plt  products could reduce the frequency of transfusion-related sepsis and prolong the shelf life of plts.

AB  == antibacterial activity of 4 commercial bleaching agents (day white, colgate platinum, whiteness 10% and 16%) on 6 oral pathogens (streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus sanguinis, candida albicans, lactobacillus  casei, and lactobacillus acidophilus) and staphylococcus aureus were evaluated. a chlorhexidine solution was used as a positive control, while distilled water was  the negative control. bleaching agents and control materials were inserted in sterilized stainless-steel cylinders that were positioned under inoculated agar plate (n = 4). after incubation according to the appropriate period of time for each microorganism, the inhibition zones were measured. data were analyzed by 2-way analysis of variance and tukey test (a = 0.05). all bleaching agents and the chlorhexidine solution produced antibacterial inhibition zones. antimicrobial activity was dependent on peroxide-based bleaching agents. for most microorganisms evaluated, bleaching agents produced inhibition zones similar to or larger than that observed for chlorhexidine. c albicans, l casei, and l acidophilus were the most resistant microorganisms.

TI  == production of antagonistic substance by eikenella corrodens isolated from the oral cavity of human beings with and without periodontal disease.
AB  == aims: antagonistic abilities may confer ecological advantages for micro-organisms in competitive ecosystems. however, reports regarding this phenomenon in eikenella corrodens are not available. methods and results: nineteen e. corrodens strains, isolated from the oral cavity of human beings without periodontal disease (n = 5) and with aggressive (n = 9) and chronic (n = 5) periodontitis, as well as a reference strain (e. corrodens atcc23834), were evaluated for antagonistic activity. the following indicators were used: porphyromonas gingivalis fdc381, prevotella intermedia atcc25611, actinomyces israelii atcc12102, eubacterium lentum atcc25559, peptostreptococcus anaerobius atcc27337, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans fdcy4, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc10953, streptococcus sanguinis atcc10557, streptococcus uberis atcc9927, streptococcus mutans im/ufrj, staphylococcus aureus atcc33591 and candida albicans atcc18804. all the strains showed antagonism against at least one of the indicator strains.  this phenomenon was more frequently observed for strains isolated from patients with chronic periodontitis (36.4%), than those from healthy subjects (20.6%) and  those with aggressive periodontitis (10.8%). conclusions: the heterogeneous antagonistic spectrum exhibited by e. corrodens isolates suggests their ability to produce more than one antagonistic substance, whose ecological relevance is yet to be demonstrated. significance and impact of the study: this is the first description of antagonistic compound production by e. corrodens and its relationships with the clinical status of the patients.

TI  == in vitro anti-microbial and in vivo cytokine modulating effects of different prepared chinese herbal medicines.
AB  == the toxicity, antimicrobial and cytokine modulating effects of herbal medicines in treating periodontal diseases were evaluated in this study. using the broth dilution method and disc agar diffusion test, in individual and combined decocted preparations, different concentrations of ching-wei-san and its individual herbal components, coptidis rhizoma, angelicae sinensis radix, rehmanniae radixet rhizom, moutan radicis cortex, and cimicifuga foetida, were tested for in vitro inhibitory effects on three well-known plaque-causing bacteria, porphyromonas gingivialis, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mutans, and two common pathogens, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. the cytokine modulating effects were evaluated in balb/c mice. the results suggested that one milliliter  ching-wei-san at the 25,000 mg/ml concentration daily for the mice had significantly high levels in the liver function indexes in the 3-day acute toxicity test and in both the liver and kidney function indexes in the 28-day subacute toxicity test (p<0.01). the 250 mg/ml ching-wei-san is comparable to 250 mg/ml of tetracycline, and had similar inhibitory effects on the tested bacteria. coptidis rhizoma (62.5 mg/ml) was the only individual herbal component to show 100% inhibitory effects. the mean cytokine ratios of il-2, il-4, ifn-gamma, and tnf-alpha in balb/c mice treated with individual herbal components were shown to  be different from each other. ching-wei-san modulated the immunity of mice, up-regulated il-2, il-4 and tnf-alpha, but down-regulated ifn-gamma. the effects  of none of the individual herbal components alone can substitute for the cumulative effect of ching-wei-san.

TI  == the role of platelets in infective endocarditis.
AB  == there is growing evidence that platelets play an important role in the development of infective endocarditis (ie). this review focuses on interactions between bacteria and platelets. many types of microorganism are capable of causing endocarditis. the oral streptococci, particularly streptococcus sanguis and s. oralis, remain the most common causative bacteria in ie but staphylococcus aureus is becoming an increasingly important agent. several species of bacteria and fungi are able to cause platelet aggregation in vitro, and there are indications that this ability is associated with the production of severe disease. different bacteria appear to utilise different mechanisms of aggregation, and mechanisms for adhesion may be distinct from those responsible for aggregation. at least one commonly studied strain of s. sanguis apparently utilises the host's igg and complement responses to induce platelet activation. ie may therefore be among the number of diseases in which immunological activation of platelets is thought to be of importance. other bacterial strains have their own adhesins and agonists. the more virulent bacteria, notably the staphylococci, also possess proteolytic enzymes and may directly activate coagulation pathways, whereas less virulent, opportunistic pathogens, such as some streptococci and candida albicans, may rely on interactions with host factors for colonisation and proliferation. it is proposed that platelets are involved in formation of the non-bacterial thrombotic vegetation (nbtv) and are necessary for the effective adhesion of bacteria to the nbtv, and that platelets  also influence the persistence and clinical outcome of the disease through proliferation of the thrombotic vegetation. it is hypothesised that successful colonisation of the heart valves by a micro-organism depends on effective adhesion of the bacteria or fungi to platelets, in combination with the ability to induce platelet activation and aggregation.

TI  == secretory iga, salivary peroxidase, and catalase-mediated microbicidal activity during hydrogen peroxide catabolism in viridans streptococci: pathogen coaggregation.
AB  == viridans streptococci can kill methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) through the production of hydrogen peroxide (h2o2). however, several hundred viridans streptococci cells are necessary to kill 1 cfu of mrsa. we analyzed the  potency of bactericidal and fungicidal effector molecules induced by catabolism of h2o2 in the oral cavity. secretory iga (siga) and an unidentified salivary component bound streptococcus sanguinis, a viridans streprococcus, and mrsa into  coaggregates. in these coaggregates, salivary peroxidase and the mrsa catalase produced singlet molecular oxygen (1o2) from h2o2 produced by viridans streptococci. siga converted 1o2 into ozone, which has potent bactericidal and fungicidal activity. we calculated that <10 cfu of streptococcus sanguinis were necessary to kill 1 cfu of mrsa in the coaggregate. siga, aspergillus niger catalase, and h2o2 in saliva killed candida albicans, which is highly resistant to reagent h2o2. together with indigenous bacteria and innate immunity, siga potentially constitutes a novel system that may sustain oral homeostasis.

TI  == vancomycin tolerance, a potential mechanism for refractory gram-positive bacteremia observational study in patients with cancer.
AB  == background: the clinical significance of infections caused by vancomycin-tolerant (vt) gram-positive organisms in patients with cancer remains unclear. methods: twenty-five patients with nonenterococcal gram-positive bloodstream infection, which was refractory to vancomycin therapy, were identified by reviewing the infectious diseases consultation database at the tertiary care cancer center. among these, 8 patients in whom vancomycin-tolerance was documented are described. antibiotic tolerance was defined as a > 32 times increase in minimum bactericidal concentration compared with minimum inhibitory concentration. results: eight patients with persistent fever and bacteremia of > 72 hours' duration after the initiation of vancomycin therapy were treated. the median age  of these patients, which included 3 men and 5 women, was 44 years +/- 11 years. solid tumors were more common (6 patients) and 2 patients had acute leukemia. six patients (75%) were neutropenic (absolute neutrophil count < 500/mm3), including  2 breast cancer patients who had undergone autologous stem cell transplantation.  the causative organisms were staphylococcus aureus (n = 3 patients), group g streptococci (n = 2 patients), and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus sanguis (1 patient each). all isolates demonstrated a minimum bactericidal concentration for vancomycin that was at least 32 times greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration. rapid defervescence (< or = 24 h) and resolution of bacteremia occurred with the addition of gentamicin (4 patients) or gentamicin plus rifampin (4 patients). none of these infections recurred after discontinuation of therapy. conclusions: lack of clinical and/or microbiologic response to vancomycin should raise the suspicion of possible infection due to vt gram-positive bacteria, and alternative bactericidal therapy  should be instituted early, especially in patients with underlying immune suppression.

AB  == to examine new cytochemical aspects of the bacterial adhesion, a strain 41452/01  of the oral commensal streptococcus sanguis and a wild strain of staphylococcus aureus were grown with and without sucrose supplementation for 6 days. osmiumtetraoxyde (oso4), uranyl acetate (ua), ruthenium red (rr), cupromeronic blue (cb) staining with critical electrolytic concentrations (cecs), and the tannic acid-metal salt technique (tamst) were applied for electron microscopy. cytochemically, only rr-positive fimbriae in s. sanguis were visualized. by contrast, some types of fimbriae staining were observed in s. aureus glycocalyx:  rr-positive, oso4-positive, tannophilic and cb-positive with ceasing point at 0.3 m mgcl2. the cb staining with cec, used for the first time for visualization of glycoproteins of bacterial glycocalyx, also reveals intacellular cb-positive substances-probably the monomeric molecules, that is, subunits forming the fimbriae via extracellular assembly. thus, glycosylated components of the biofilm matrix can be reliably related to single cells. the visualization of intracellular components by cb with cec enables clear distinction between s. aureus and other bacteria, which do not produce cb-positive substances. the small quantities of tannophilic substances found in s. aureus makes the use of tamst for the same purpose difficult. the present work protocol enables, for the first  time, a partial cytochemical differentiation of the bacterial glycocalyx.

AB  == the participation of bacterial biofilms in the over-filled gutta-percha points associated with refractory periapical periodontitis has recently been reported. this study investigated the initial biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates (enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia) on gutta-percha points in vitro. each bacterial strain was suspended in 100% cell culture medium or in culture medium containing 4.5, 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the bacterial suspensions were then co-incubated anaerobically with gutta-percha  points for 7 d. the gutta-percha points were processed for scanning electron microscopic observation and examined for biofilm presence and thickness. e. faecalis, strep. sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus biofilms were generated on the surfaces of the specimens incubated in culture medium supplemented with 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the e. faecalis and strep. sanguis biofilms were significantly thicker than those of strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus. no biofilms were detected on the specimens incubated with f. nucleatum, prop. acnes, porph. gingivalis and prev. intermedia. these findings suggest that gram-positive facultative anaerobes have the ability  to colonize and form extracellular matrices on gutta-percha points, while serum plays a crucial role in biofilm formation.

TI  == biofilm-specific surface properties and protein expression in oral streptococcus  sanguis.
AB  == objective: oral streptococci are primary colonisers of the tooth surface and are  abundant in dental plaque biofilms. bacteria growing in these relatively dense, surface-associated communities are phenotypically quite distinct from their planktonic counterparts. the purpose of the present study was to develop a method to investigate biofilm-specific surface protein expression by streptococcus sanguis to help provide a better understanding of the critical events in plaque development. design: biofilm cells were grown on the surface of glass beads in a  biofilm device fed with mucin-containing artificial saliva. planktonic cells were grown in continuous culture at approximately the same growth rate. surface hydrophobicity of biofilm and planktonic cells was determined by hexadecane partitioning, and expression of streptococcal fibronectin adhesin csha was determined in elisa using specific antiserum. antisera raised to glutaraldehyde-fixed whole biofilm or planktonic grown cells were used to screen  an expression library of s. sanguis genomic dna, and isolated clones were sequenced. results: phenotypic analysis of biofilm and planktonic cells confirmed that mode of growth affected surface properties of s. sanguis. thus, hydrophobicity and csha expression was significantly elevated in biofilm cells. library screening with biofilm antiserum yielded 32 recombinant clones representing 21 different s. sanguis proteins involved in adhesion and colonisation, carbohydrate utilisation or bacterial metabolism. in differential analysis of four selected escherichia coli clones, biofilm antiserum reacted five times stronger than planktonic antiserum with cell-free extracts of clones encoding homologues of csha and cna collagen adhesin of staphylococcus aureus, suggesting that these surface proteins are up-regulated in biofilm cells. in contrast, both antisera reacted equally strongly with cell-free extracts of the remaining two clones (encoding dihydrofolate synthase and an unknown protein). conclusions: the method described represents a useful means for determining bacterial protein expression in biofilms based on a combination of molecular and  immunological techniques. surface expression of putative fibronectin and collagen adhesins was up-regulated in biofilm cells.

AB  == the authors discuss the morbidity associated with viridans streptococcus bacteremia, and its implications on the choice of antibiotics used as prophylaxis and treatment. they retrospectively studied the case notes of 38 children who were being treated for various malignant conditions in their unit and developed 40 episodes of bacteremia with viridans streptococci between october 1995 and january 1999. viridans streptococci were the third commonest blood culture isolate during this period, after coagulase-negative staphylococci and staphylococcus aureus. the majority of the isolates were streptococcus mitis (55%). others were s. sanguis (25%), s. oralis (12.5%), s. salivarius (5%), and s. acidominimus (2.5%). twenty-five percent of the patients had been treated with regimens that included cytosine arabinoside, 60% were receiving prophylactic co-trimoxazole, and 87.5% were neutropenic. thirty percent of patients had abnormal chest x-rays, and 15% were hypotensive; 2 patients required admission to the intensive care unit. initial antibiotic therapy was changed because of failure of clinical response in 60% of cases, despite the infecting organism being sensitive in vitro. this study confirms the importance of viridans streptococci as a cause of bacteremia in pediatric hematology and oncology patients, leading to significant morbidity. further work is required to establish the optimal treatment for viridans streptococcus bacteremia.

AB  == aim: to determine whether 'mgp' gutta-percha (westport, ct, usa), a commercially  available gutta-percha containing iodoform, inhibits the growth of potential endodontic pathogens. methodology: inocula of enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus sanguis, fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces odontolyticus were spread onto the surface of agar plates. 'mgp' gutta-percha cones presoaked in sterile water were transferred to the inoculated agar and incubated at 37 degrees c aerobically or anaerobically as required for optimal growth. identical studies were performed using iodoform-free gutta-percha and sterile paper disks saturated with 10% povidone-iodine. following incubation, zones of inhibition around the 'mgp' gutta-percha, iodoform-free gutta-percha and disks were evaluated. results: povidone-iodine inhibited all the strains. iodoform-free gutta-percha inhibited s. sanguis and a. odontolyticus. 'mgp' gutta-percha inhibited s. aureus, s. sanguis, a. odontolyticus and f. nucleatum. neither iodoform-free gutta-percha nor 'mgp' gutta-percha inhibited growth of e. faecalis, e. coli or p. aeruginosa. conclusions: compared to iodoform-free gutta-percha, iodoform-containing 'mgp' gutta-percha had an inhibitory effect in vitro on s. aureus and f. nucleatum, but not on e. faecalis, e. coli or p. aeruginosa.

AB  == the acid-soluble extract of the bladder mucosal surface was obtained by washing out the bladder with dilute acetic acid in the presence of protease inhibitors. the wash-out materials from rats, rabbits, pigs, and humans manifested strong bactericidal activity against e. coli in vitro. the ultrafiltrate of the human material, which contained two major peptides with apparent molecular masses of 6.7 kd and 8.5 kd, respectively, showed potent bactericidal activity against e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus sanguis. three antibacterial polypeptides (pibps) were purified from the porcine material. the molecular masses of pibp-5, pibp-11 and pibp-25 were 5773.3 da, 11127.8 da and 25073 da, respectively. pibp-5 was unusually rich in glycine, serine and threonine residues (20.0, 16.3 and 10.4 mol%, respectively), and n-terminal amino acid sequencing revealed that pibp-5 was homologous (83.3% identity in an 18 residue overlay) to the "tail" of human cytokeratin-7. although the amino acid compositions of pibp-11 and pibp-25 were established, both had blocked n-termini  and primary sequence data were not obtained. these results provided evidence indicating that the presence of peptides in the bladder mucosa could enable it to kill adherent bacteria.

TI  == echocardiographic presentations of endocarditis, and risk factors for rupture of  a sinus of valsalva in childhood.
AB  == background: in recent years, the diagnosis of infective endocarditis has been enhanced by the use of echocardiography. we sought, therefore, to review its effect on the management of endocarditis in children. methods: we reviewed all the patients presenting to our institution for evaluation for infective endocarditis from may 1994 to january 2002. the patients were stratified according to whether or not they had congenitally malformed hearts. results: of the 90 referred patients identified, 46 (51%) had positive ultrasonic findings. of these, we excluded 26 patients because of the presence of indwelling lines. the remaining 20 patients with features of endocarditis had a median age of 6.5 years, and a range from 0.14 to 8.5 years. there were 4 patients with normal hearts, and 16 with congenital cardiac malformations. we identified rupture of a  sinus of valsalva in four patients, with rupture into the left ventricle in two,  and into the right ventricle and right atrium in one each. the mitral valve was involved in six patients, the aortic valve in another six, including all four with rupture of the sinus of valsalva, both mitral and aortic valves in three, the pulmonary trunk in three patients, and the tricuspid valve and a blalock-taussig shunt in one patient each. organisms isolated included streptococcus mitis in 4 patients, streptococcus pneumoniae in 2 patients, streptococcus sanguis in 1, staphylococcus aureus in 3, staphylococcus epidermidis in 1, and enteroccocus in 2. cultures proved negative in 7 patients.  surgical intervention was needed in 12 patients, and one died (5%). only the left-sided chambers were involved in those with normal hearts. both patients infected with streptococcus pneumoniae had rupture of a sinus of valsalva. conclusion: involvement of the left-sided chambers is more likely in structurally normal hearts, and in cases with rupture of a sinus of valsalva, in which case infection with streptococcus pneumonia should be suspected.

TI  == selective lethal photosensitization of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus using an igg-tin (iv) chlorin e6 conjugate.
AB  == objectives: the growing resistance of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) to conventional antimicrobial agents necessitates the development of alternative approaches to preventing and treating infections. one such approach is photodynamic therapy, whereby target cells are treated with light-activated drugs (photosensitizers). this investigation aimed to determine whether the ability of mrsa to express the igg-binding protein, protein a, could be exploited to enable selective lethal photosensitization of the organism with a photosensitizer [tin (iv) chlorin e6; snce6] linked to igg. methods: various strains of mrsa were exposed to light from a helium/neon laser in the presence of an igg-snce6 conjugate and the survivors enumerated by viable counting. controls  consisted of suspensions irradiated in the presence or absence of the conjugate and suspensions kept in the dark in the presence of the conjugate. similar experiments were also carried out using the unconjugated photosensitizer. the experiments were repeated using a suspension consisting of both emrsa-16 and streptococcus sanguis. results: emrsa-16 was killed by igg-snce6 and snce6 in a light-dose- and photosensitizer-dependent manner. greater kills were achieved with the igg-snce6 than with the unconjugated snce6 using the same light energy dose and photosensitizer concentration. furthermore, the igg-snce6 conjugate, but not snce6, was able to kill emrsa-16 selectively in a suspension that also contained s. sanguis without any reduction in the viable count of the latter. conclusion: these results demonstrate that selective lethal photosensitization of mrsa can be achieved using an igg-tin (iv) chlorin e6 conjugate. the effectiveness of killing was dependent, in part, on the particular mrsa strain used, with the clinically important emrsa-16 strain being the most susceptible.

TI  == a retrospective investigation of advanced periodontal disease as a risk factor for septicemia in hematopoietic stem cell and bone marrow transplant recipients.
AB  == objective: septicemia is a cause of death in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (hsct) recipients. extraction of teeth with advanced periodontitis has been advocated before hsct to prevent septicemia in myeloablated hosts. the primary aim of the present study was to determine impact of chronic periodontitis, as measured by radiographic alveolar bone loss, on septicemia and transplant mortality. study design: a retrospective design was used to study 77 subjects who received pretransplant dental evaluation, panoramic radiography, and full myeloablative allogeneic hsct to treat hematologic malignancies. radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss was measured with a schei ruler on all teeth. microorganisms isolated from positive blood cultures within the first 100 days after transplant were categorized as of likely origin from periodontal, oral, or  any body sites. spearman correlation and logistic regression analysis assessed associations between positive blood cultures, mean subject whole-mouth percent radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss, and 100-day survival. results: radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss per study subject averaged 13% +/- 7%, with 18.2% exhibiting bone loss of 20% or greater. during the initial 100 days after transplant, 63.6% subjects yielded septicemia-associated positive blood cultures, with staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli as the most common isolates recovered. no statistically significant associations were found between mean subject radiographic alveolar bone loss and septicemia of likely periodontal or oral origin. conclusion: in this preliminary study, no relationship was found between radiographic periodontal status and septicemia or  mortality within the initial 100 days after transplant. a larger-sized, prospective study is warranted to further delineate the risk of septicemia from periodontal and other oral diseases in immunocompromised patients.

TI  == monocytes maintain tissue factor activity after cytolysis of bacteria-infected endothelial cells in an in vitro model of bacterial endocarditis.
AB  == intravascular infection with staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, or streptococcus sanguis can initiate fibrin formation on endocardial tissue, causing bacterial endocarditis. the ability of these bacteria to injure intact endothelial cells (ecs) and to aggravate tissue factor (tf)-dependent coagulation in the presence of blood leukocytes was investigated. cytolysis of ecs occurred after infection with s. aureus and, with membrane-bound monocytes or granulocytes present, also after infection with s. sanguis or s. epidermidis. monocytes that subsequently bound to the resultant bacteria-infected subcellular ec matrix (ecm) elicited tf mrna, tf antigen, and tf activity (tfa). this was most pronounced in  ecm prepared after the cytolysis of ecs by infection with s. aureus or s. epidermidis. we demonstrate that monocytes continue and intensify fibrin formation after lysis of bacteria-infected ecs, which suggests that, during the course of intravascular infection, early fibrin formation shifts from being mediated by ec-derived tfa to being mediated by tfa of monocytes bound to bacteria-infected ecm.

TI  == in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against selected bacterial pathogens isolated in italy.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin, against 732 clinical strains recently isolated in italy. methods: susceptibility tests were performed according to nccls-guided mic methodology. pathogens included in the evaluation included 108 staphylococcus aureus isolates, 124 coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates, 158 streptococcus pyogenes isolates, 30 streptococcus agalactiae isolates, 30 b-hemolytic streptococcal isolates, 18 streptococcus sanguis isolates, 80 streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 69 enterococcal isolates, 40 haemophilus influenzae isolates, 30 moraxella catarrhalis isolates and, finally, 30 gram-positive and 25 gram-negative anaerobes. results: quinupristin/dalfopristin  inhibited staphylococcus aureus and other staphylococcus spp., irrespective of their oxacillin or erythromycin resistance phenotypes. similarly, streptococci were fully inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin. enterococcus faecalis was not  included in the spectrum of this streptogramin, while isolates of enterococcus faecium were inhibited by the new compound. respiratory pathogens such as h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis were inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin as well as all gram-negative anaerobes tested. conclusions: these findings suggest a putative role for quinupristin/dalfopristin in the empirical treatment of severe  nosocomial and community-acquired infections caused by pathogens often displaying resistance to multiple antibiotics. this drug may provide an alternative to glycopeptide compounds.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of four root canal sealers against endodontic pathogens.
AB  == the antibacterial effects of various types of widely used endodontic sealers have not been compared systematically on facultative or obligate anaerobic endodontic  pathogens. the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of  four commonly used endodontic sealers: two epoxy-resin-based sealers (ah26, ah plus), one zinc-oxide eugenol-based sealer (n2), and one calcium hydroxide-based  sealer (sealapex). the testing microbes were four facultative anaerobic species (streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus) and four obligate anaerobic species (porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia). the freshly mixed sealers were placed into the prepared wells of agar plates inoculated with the test microorganisms. after varying periods of incubation (2 days for facultative anaerobic species and 7 days for obligate anaerobic species), the zones of growth inhibition were observed and measured. all the sealers were distinctly different from each other in their antimicrobial  activity. the sealers showed different inhibitory effects depending on the types  and bacterial strains. n2 containing formaldehyde and eugenol proved to be the most effective against the microorganisms. the extreme antimicrobial potency of this root canal sealer must be weighted against its pronounced tissue toxic effect.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of extract and isolated major alkaloids (berberine, beta-hydrastine, canadine and canadaline) of hydrastis canadensis l. (ranunculaceae) was evaluated against 6 strains of microorganism: staphylococcus  aureus (atcc 25 993 and atcc 6538p), streptococcus sanguis (atcc 10 556), escherichia coli (atcc 25 922), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27 853). bactericidal activity was evaluated by contact test by measuring the "killing time" on a low density bacterial inoculum, and bacteriostatic activity in liquid  medium by m.i.c. values. the results provide a rational basis for the traditional antibacterial use of hydrastis canadensis.

TI  == investigation of bacteremia after orthodontic banding and debanding following chlorhexidine mouth wash application.
AB  == this study investigates the prevalence of bacteremia after orthodontic banding and debanding, following the application of a 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash. the banding and debanding groups were each composed of 40 young adult  patients. in the banding group, patients were asked to rinse their mouth with chlorhexidine gluconate for 60 seconds just prior to fitting of the bands. in the debanding group, they were asked to use the mouthwash immediately before removal  of bands and brackets. in both groups pre- and post-treatment blood samples were  obtained with a strict aseptic technique. in the banding group, no bacteremia was detected in the pretreatment sample and 2.5% post-treatment bacteremia was detected in the post-treatment sample. in the debanding group, 2.5% bacteremia was found in both the pre- and post-treatment samples. the prevalence of post-treatment bacteremia found in the present study were compared with the findings of 2 preliminary studies in which the prevalence of bacteremia had been  investigated after banding and debanding without a prior application of chlorhexidine mouthwash. the application of chlorhexidine mouthwash resulted in a decrease in the prevalence of bacteremia after banding and debanding, but the decrease was not statistically significant.

TI  == monocytes augment bacterial species- and strain-dependent induction of tissue factor activity in bacterium-infected human vascular endothelial cells.
AB  == in bacterial endocarditis (be), intravascular infection with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sanguis, or staphylococcus epidermidis can lead to formation of a fibrin clot on the inner surface of the heart and cause heart dysfunction. the events that start the coagulation in the early stage of the disease are largely unknown. we have recently shown that human endothelial cells  (ec) upon binding and internalization of s. aureus, but not s. sanguis or s. epidermidis, express tissue factor (tf)-dependent procoagulant activity (tfa). the present study shows that infection of ec with these three pathogens induces surface expression of intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (icam-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (vcam-1) and monocyte adhesion. subsequent coculture of  these cells synergistically enhanced tfa, which was exclusively dependent on tf molecules that were expressed on ec during coculture. tfa induction required direct contact between monocytes and bacterium-infected ec, but the signals for this response were not generated by the binding of monocytes through their beta(2)- or alpha(4)-integrins to icam-1 or vcam-1, respectively, on infected ec. the mechanism by which monocytes induce tfa in bacterium-infected ec was partly mediated by the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 produced by the cells during coculture. endogenous tumor necrosis factor alpha was not involved. this modulating effect of monocytes on species- and strain-dependent tfa of bacterium-infected ec supports our hypothesis that in an early stage in the pathogenesis of be, as well as other intravascular infections that lead to detrimental fibrin formation, the coagulation cascade can be activated on the surfaces of ec as a consequence of specific interactions between pathogenic bacteria, ec, and monocytes.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of histidine-rich polypeptides in human parotid saliva].
AB  == two ultrasensitive antibacterial assays were applied to determine the antibacterial activity of histidine-rich polypeptides (hrps) in human parotid saliva. the results not only confirmed the potent antibacterial activity of hrps  against streptococcus mutans mt6r, but also showed for the first time that hrps were effectively antibacterial to staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, escherichia coli ml-35p and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853. among hrps, hrp3, hrp5 and hrp6 were the major antibacterial components which were active against s. mutans, s. aureus, e. coli and p. aeruginosa, whereas hrp1 was only effective against e.  coli. s. sanguis was resistant to the action of hrps. these results suggest that  hrps are actually a family of endogenous antibiotic peptides with broad antimicrobial spectrum including fungi, gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria  and may play an important role in the prevention of various infection diseases in the oral cavity as well as in the resistance to caries.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria from healthy oral cavity of thai volunteers: inhibition of oral pathogens.
AB  == the aims of the present study were to screen and characterize the antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria which were isolated from healthy oral cavities of thai volunteers, and to characterize their inhibiting substances. among 3790 isolates  (suspected to be lactic acid bacteria) from 130 volunteers, five showed an appreciable effect against sarcina lutea atcc 9341, bacillus cereus atcc 11778, escherichia coli atcc 25922, staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, streptococcus mutans dtmu 1, strep. salivarius dtmu 1, strep. sanguis dtmu 1, candida albicans  atcc 13803 and c. albicans dtmu 2, as well as the oral pathogens. these antimicrobial isolates included l17 and n14 which showed the antibacterial activity, d14 which showed the anticandidal activity, and d6 and n8 which showed  both the antibacterial and anticandidal activities. the isolates were later found to be facultative anaerobic, gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-capsule-forming and catalase-negative bacilli. they could utilize casein but  could not hydrolyse starch, and they produced hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins. their antimicrobial potentials were found to be affected by ph, catalase, proteolytic enzymes and temperature. the activity was partially inactivated after catalase treatment, significantly declined at ph > or =9.0 or after trypsin and pepsin treatments, and also reduced after heating at > or =100 degrees c. however, the antimicrobial activity of these five isolates was somewhat resistant to heat. when the isolates were tested for their antimicrobial sensitivity, they  were shown to be sensitive to a number of antimicrobial agents. the final identification revealed that d6, d14 and n14 were lactobacillus paracasei subsp.  paracasei, and l17 and n8 were lact. rhamnosus.

TI  == commercial preparations of lipoteichoic acid contain endotoxin that contributes to activation of mouse macrophages in vitro.
AB  == lipoteichoic acids (lta), cell wall components of gram-positive bacteria, have been reported to induce various inflammatory mediators and to play a key role in  gram-positive-microbe-mediated septic shock. in a large number of these studies,  investigators used commercially available lta purified from a variety of gram-positive bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, and streptococcus sanguis. we report here that, although these commercially available lta could be readily shown to stimulate production of nitric oxide (no) in raw 264.7 mouse macrophages, the activity was dramatically inhibited by polymyxin b,  a relatively specific inhibitor of endotoxin biological activity. one-step purification of the commercially available s. aureus lta using hydrophobic interaction chromatography resulted in two well-separated peak fractions, one highly enriched for lta and a second highly enriched for endotoxin. the lta-enriched fractions did not induce production of no in raw 264.7 macrophages,  although they caused a dose-dependent induction of no in the presence of low concentrations of gamma interferon (ifn-gamma) (which by itself induced little no), regardless of the presence of polymyxin b. in contrast, the endotoxin-enriched fractions by themselves inhibited in high levels of no in raw  264.7 macrophages but activity was almost completely inhibited in the presence of polymyxin b. consistent with these findings, our data also indicate that commercial lta preparations from s. aureus, b. subtilis, and s. sanguis were not  able to induce no from lipopolysaccharide-hyporesponsive c3h/hej mouse peritoneal macrophages, but in the presence of ifn-gamma, these lta preparations were able to induce relatively high levels of no from c3h/hej macrophages. these results indicate that commercially available lta can contain contaminating and potentially significant levels of endotoxin that can be expected to contribute to the putative macrophage-stimulating effects of lta as assessed by no production.  the fact that the purified lta, by itself, was not able to induce significant levels of no secretion in raw 264.7 macrophages supports the conclusion that caution in attributing high-level biological activity to this microbial cell wall constituent should be exercised.

TI  == colorimetric indicators of microbial contamination in corneal preservation medium.
AB  == purpose: to compare acid-base and oxidation-reduction indicators and to investigate the effect of buffer and temperature on the colorimetric detection of microbial growth in corneal preservation media. methods: corneal preservation media containing gentamicin, without or with hepes buffer, were prepared with either phenol red or alamarblue indicators (accumed international, westlake, oh,  u.s.a.). both media were inoculated with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sanguis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, or candida albicans and then incubated at 4 degrees c, 22 degrees c, or 35 degrees c. the ph or percent reduction were determined hourly for eight hours, then daily for one week. results: the length of time before a confirmed change in ph or reduction occurred varied by microorganism, storage temperature, and buffering capacity. at 4 degrees c, none of the microorganisms caused a detectable ph change in buffered medium within one day after inoculation, although two bacterial species reduced alamarblue within four hours. at 22 degrees c and 35 degrees c, all bacteria except p. aeruginosa produced a ph shift within a few hours, and all tested bacterial species reduced alamarblue. for bacteria producing detectable ph changes, hepes-buffered medium took longer to change than medium without hepes. c. albicans was not detectable in hepes-buffered medium at any temperature by phenol red and was only detectable by alamarblue after 2-3 days at 22 degrees c and 35 degrees c. conclusion: acidic shifts in refrigerated corneal preservation  medium do not occur during contamination by several microorganisms. alamarblue, a redox indicator, is more sensitive than phenol red in detecting some bacteria. c. albicans is not reliably detected by ph or redox indicators.

TI  == role of monocytes in experimental staphylococcus aureus endocarditis.
AB  == in the pathogenesis of bacterial endocarditis (be), the clotting system plays a cardinal role in the formation and maintenance of the endocardial vegetations. the extrinsic pathway is involved in the activation of the coagulation pathway with tissue factor (tf) as the key protein. staphylococcus aureus is a frequently isolated bacterium from patients with be. we therefore investigated whether s. aureus can induce tf activity (tfa) on fibrin-adherent monocytes, used as an in vitro model of be. we also assessed in vivo in rabbits with catheter induced vegetations, the effect of s. aureus infection on vegetational tfa. in vitro experiments showed that adherent s. aureus induced tfa on fibrin-adherent monocytes which was optimal at a bacterium/monocyte ratio of 1 to 1. monocyte damage occurred when this ratio exceeded 4 to 1 (visually) or 6 to 1 (propidium iodide influx) consequently, tfa decreased. in vivo s. aureus led to very high bacterial numbers in the vegetations and a significant increase of their weight.  however, tfa of infected vegetations was the same as of sterile ones. this may be due to the high bacteria to monocyte ratio as well as bacterium-induced monocyte  damage. teicoplanin treatment of infected rabbits reduced bacterial numbers in the blood and in the vegetations. two-day treatment resulted in an increase of vegetational tfa, but after four-day treatment vegetational tfa dropped, most probably due to a suboptimal bacterium/monocyte ratio. s. aureus endocarditis in  etoposide (vepesid)-treated rabbits, leading to a selective monocytopenia, caused a rapid death of the animals. in these rabbits no vegetations were found at all.  we conclude that, like streptococcus sanguis and staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus is able to induce tfa in fibrin-adherent blood monocytes. in addition, monocytes have a protective effect during the course of s. aureus endocarditis.

TI  == ib-367, a protegrin peptide with in vitro and in vivo activities against the microflora associated with oral mucositis.
AB  == although the microflora associated with oral mucositis initiated by cytotoxic therapy is not well characterized, several studies suggest that reduction of the  microbial load in the oral cavity has some clinical benefit. the mics of ib-367,  a synthetic protegrin analog, ranged from 0.13 to 64 microgram/ml for gram-positive bacteria (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, and staphylococcus aureus) and from 0.06 to 8 microgram/ml for gram-negative species (klebsiella, escherichia, and pseudomonas). ib-367 exhibited rapid, microbicidal activity against both log- and stationary-phase cultures of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and pseudomonas aeruginosa. at concentrations near the mics for these two organisms (4 and 2 microgram/ml, respectively), ib-367 reduced viability by more than 3 logs in less than 16 min. similarly, ib-367 effected a 4-log reduction of the endogenous microflora in pooled human saliva within 2 min at 250 microgram/ml, a concentration readily attained by local delivery. after nine serial transfers at  0.5x the mic, the mic of ib-367 for mrsa and p. aeruginosa increased only two to  four times. in a phase i clinical study with healthy volunteers, ib-367 was well  tolerated, with no detectable systemic absorption. one hour after treatment with  9 mg of ib-367, the prevalence of gram-negative bacteria and yeast was reduced, and the density of the predominant gram-positive oral flora was decreased 1,000 times. ib-367's properties (speed of killing, breadth of spectrum, and lack of resistance) make the compound a strong candidate for the prophylaxis of oral mucositis. phase ii clinical trials with ib-367 are under way for this indication in immunocompromised subjects.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis and arnica montana against oral pathogens.
AB  == arnica and propolis have been used for thousands of years in folk medicine for several purposes. they possess several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral and tissue regenerative, among others. although the antibacterial activity of propolis has already been demonstrated, very few studies have been done on bacteria of clinical relevance in dentistry. also, the antimicrobial activity of arnica has not been extensively investigated. therefore the aim here was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial activity, inhibition of adherence of mutans streptococci and inhibition of formation of water-insoluble glucan by arnica and propolis extracts. arnica montana (10%, w/v) and propolis (10%, w/v) extracts from minas gerais state were compared with controls. fifteen microorganisms were used as follows: candida albicans--ntcc 3736, f72; staphylococcus aureus--atcc 25923; enterococcus faecalis--atcc 29212;  streptococcus sobrinus 6715; strep. sanguis--atcc 10556; strep. cricetus--hs-6; strep. mutans--ingbritt 1600; strep. mutans--omz 175; actinomyces naeslundii--atcc 12104, w 1053; act. viscosus omz 105; porphyromonas gingivalis;  porph. endodontalis and prevotella denticola (the last three were clinical isolates). antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. to assess cell adherence to a glass surface, the organisms were grown for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30  degree angle. to assay water-insoluble glucan formation, a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase and 0.125 m sucrose was incubated for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. arnica and propolis extracts (20 microl) were added to these tubes to evaluate the % of inhibition of cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation. the propolis extract significantly inhibited all the microorganisms tested (p < 0.05), showing the largest inhibitory zone for actinomyces spp. the arnica extract did not demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity. cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation were almost completely inhibited by the propolis extract at a final concentration of 400 microg/ml and 500 microg/ml, respectively. the arnica extract showed slight inhibition of the adherence of the growing cells (19% for strep. mutans and 15% for strep. sobrinus) and of water-insoluble glucan formation (29%) at these same  concentrations. thus, the propolis extract showed in vitro antibacterial activity, inhibition of cell adherence and inhibition of water-insoluble glucan formation, while the arnica extract was only slightly active in those three conditions.

TI  == the in vitro effects of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate on oral and pharyngeal microorganisms of various ecological niches.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the in vitro susceptibility to cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate for various aerobic and anaerobic micro-organisms responsible for oral and pharyngeal diseases by assessing the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations  (mbcs) or minimum fungicidal concentrations (mfcs) and by determining kill-times. the mics of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate for 46 tested strains (25 reference strains and 21 clinical isolates) ranged from 8 to 500 micrograms/ml. the mic was found to be 31.25 micrograms/ml for 36% of the reference strains. even lower mic values (15.63 micrograms/ml) were observed for some anaerobic strains, for haemophilus influenzae and for candida tropicalis. mic and mbc values corresponded for the majority of strains tested while the mfc for c. tropicalis and c. albicans was much higher. only 9.5% of the clinical isolates gave a mic value of 31.25 micrograms/ml. enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus showed mic at 62.5 micrograms/ml. the mic and  mbc values among the isolates were comparable, while the mfc value for the yeasts was greater. a concentration of 125 micrograms/ml of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate inhibited the growth of all bacteria, except enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonaceae, and yeasts. cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate shows very rapid kill-time for s. sanguis (0"), and rapid (15") for s. pyogenes, s. dysgalactiae and s. mutans and for moraxella catarrhalis, while a longer kill-time was necessary for the other microbes tested.

TI  == experimental uveitis induced by intravitreal or intravenous lipoteichoic acid in  rabbits.
AB  == purpose: to investigate the role of lipoteichoic acid (lta), one of the cell wall components in gram-positive bacteria in uveitis. methods: intraocular inflammation in rabbit eyes was induced by intravitreal or intravenous injections of lta from staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus sanguis. the inflammation was  monitored progressively with the laser flare-cell photometer, and examined by periodic clinical observations. histological examinations were performed 24 hours after administration, and aqueous protein concentrations and cell counts were also determined. results: intraocular inflammation appeared within 6-9 hours of lta intravitreal injection. became maximal at about 24-48 hours postinjection, and lasted for nearly 6 days. intraocular inflammation was also induced by intravenous injection of lta at a higher dose. inflammation reached a peak 4-5 hours after injection, and rapidly disappeared in 24 hours. no cellular response  was observed in intravenous lta-treated eyes. conclusions: this study demonstrates that ltas from gram-positive bacteria have the biological activity to induce intraocular inflammation in rabbits by intravitreal or intravenous injection. therefore, we suggest that lta may play a role in the pathogenesis of  uveitis as one of the etiological factors.

TI  == efficacy of levofloxacin for experimental aortic-valve endocarditis in rabbits infected with viridans group streptococcus or staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == levofloxacin is among the more active fluoroquinolones against streptococci and staphylococci. it is effective against moderately severe infections caused by these organisms, but its efficacy in the treatment of bacteremia and serious infections such as endocarditis is not well defined. we compared the efficacy of  levofloxacin to those of standard agents in the rabbit model of aortic-valve endocarditis caused by fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains including a penicillin-susceptible strain of streptococcus sanguis, a penicillin-resistant strain of streptococcus mitis, a methicillin-resistant strain of staphylococcus aureus, and a methicillin-susceptible strain of s. aureus. levofloxacin administered intramuscularly at dosages of 20 to 40 mg/kg of body weight twice daily (b.i.d.) was completely ineffective against the penicillin-susceptible strain, with mean vegetation titers after 3 days of therapy not statistically significantly different from those for controls. levofloxacin was no more effective than penicillin against the penicillin-resistant strain. levofloxacin administered for 4 days at a dosage of 20 mg/kg b.i.d. was at least as effective  as vancomycin administered intravenously at a dosage of 25 mg/kg b.i. d. against  the methicillin-resistant s. aureus strain and was as effective as nafcillin administered intramuscularly at 100 mg three times daily against the methicillin-susceptible strain. emergence of resistance to levofloxacin in vitro  was less likely to occur than resistance to ciprofloxacin, and resistance to levofloxacin was not observed in vivo. levofloxacin-rifampin combinations were antagonistic in vitro and in vivo. levofloxacin was highly effective as a single  agent against experimental staphylococcal endocarditis but was surprisingly ineffective against streptococcal endocarditis, suggesting that it has a potential role as treatment for serious s. aureus but not viridans group streptococcal infections in humans.

TI  == bacterial species- and strain-dependent induction of tissue factor in human vascular endothelial cells.
AB  == a cardinal process in bacterial endocarditis (be) is the activation of the clotting system and the formation of a fibrin clot on the inner surface of the heart, the so-called endocardial vegetation. the processes that lead to the activation of the clotting system on endothelial surfaces upon exposure to bacteria are largely unknown. in the present study, we investigated in an in vitro model whether infection of human endothelial cells (ec) with bacteria that  are relevant to be, such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sanguis, and staphylococcus epidermidis, leads to induction of tissue factor (tf)-dependent procoagulant activity (tfa) and whether this process is influenced by host factors, such as interleukin-1 (il-1), that are produced in response to the bacteremia in vivo. the results show that s. aureus binds to and is internalized  by ec, resulting in expression of tf mrna and tf surface protein as well as generation of tfa within 4 to 8 h after infection. no tfa was found when ec were  exposed to uv-irradiated s. aureus or bacterial cell wall fragments. s. sanguis and s. epidermidis, although also binding to ec, did not induce endothelial tfa.  this indicates a species and strain dependency. ec also expressed tfa after exposure to il-1. the enhanced tfa of ec after exposure to s. aureus was not prevented by il-1 receptor antagonist, arguing against an auto- or paracrine contribution of endogenous il-1. when il-1 was applied together with bacteria, this had a synergistic effect on the induction of ec tfa. this was found in particular with s. aureus but also, although to a lesser degree, with s. sanguis  and s. epidermidis. this influence of il-1 on the species- and strain-dependent induction of ec tfa suggests that bacterial factors as well as host factors orchestrate the induction of coagulation in an early stage in the pathogenesis of endovascular disease, such as be.

TI  == spondylodiscitis caused by viridans streptococci: three cases and a review of the literature.
AB  == three cases of spondylodiscitis caused by viridans streptococci were observed within the course of 1 month. although streptococci have been reported as the third most frequent cause of spondylodiscitis after staphylococci and gram-negative bacteria, alpha-haemolytic streptococci are rarely seen. the three  patients presented with symptoms of low back pain; they felt well and did not have a fever or chills. laboratory examinations revealed inflammation. further examinations such as scintigraphy, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging were done. bacteriological diagnosis was established by blood cultures in two cases and by needle biopsy of the disco-vertebral space in one. in one patient endocarditis was also documented. because the prevalence of endocarditis  was found to be higher in our cases of spondylodiscitis due to streptococcus viridans than for other bacteria, the exclusion of this diagnosis must be pursued aggressively. these observations lead us to question if the spectrum of bacteria  causing spondylodiscitis is undergoing a change. an aetiological agent could be isolated in 1168 patients (85.4%): in 48% a staphylococcus, in 28% a gram-negative bacterium and in only 10% a streptococcus. there were two cases of  viridans streptococci (0.2%). these two cases together with other single case reports [14-22] account for 15 cases of spondylodiscitis due to alpha-haemolytic  streptococci. differentiation of the organisms to the species level was accomplished in six cases: s. mitis (3), s. sanguis (2) and s. anginosus (1). although a multitude of organisms, bacterial as well as fungal, causing spondylodiscitis has been reported in recent years, almost all were single cases  [23-42]. the unusual observation of three cases of spondylodiscitis due to alpha-haemolytic streptococci within 1 month prompted us to review the clinical and laboratory findings and to compare these cases with those caused by staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == cure of implantable venous port-associated bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology-oncology patients without catheter removal.
AB  == the efficacy of antibiotic treatment of port-associated bloodstream infection without device removal has not been systematically studied. we analyzed the outcome of 43 consecutive port-associated bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology-oncology patients. etiologies included staphylococcus epidermidis (30) and staphylococcus aureus (6). antibiotics were given through the port for a median of 11 days. four ports were removed within 72 hours. in 36 (92%) of the remaining 39 episodes, there was a response to antibiotic therapy (defervescence  and negative blood culture). in 78% of episodes in which there was a response (excluding two in which the catheters were removed because of mechanical problems), the infections were cured without port removal. two of the four relapses were cured with a second course of antibiotics. the cure rate was 92% for s. epidermidis infections and 67% for s. aureus infections. thus, the majority of port-associated bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology-oncology patients can be cured without device removal.

TI  == increased interleukin-6, interferon-gamma and tumour necrosis factor-alpha production by tonsillar mononuclear cells stimulated with alpha-streptococci in patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris.
AB  == in vitro cytokine production by tonsillar mononuclear cells under culture conditions with or without lyophilized streptococcal antigens was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). under culture conditions without any stimulus, a certain amount of interferon (ifn)-gamma, tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, and interleukin (il)-6, was detected in the supernatant culture fluids from all 29 donors tested and just detectable levels of il-1alpha and il-2 were identified in 5 of 12 donors tested; but il-4 and il-5 were not detected in  any supernatants from 21 donors tested. in 16 patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (ppp), all three alpha-streptococcal antigens from streptococcus, (s.) sanguis, s. salivarius and s. mitis induced production of il-6. ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha by tonsillar mononuclear cells at a significant level. however, no  significant induction of such cytokines by alpha-streptococcal stimulus was seen  in 13 donors without ppp. no significant difference in cytokine production by tonsillar mononuclear cells was seen between the ppp and non-ppp subjects, when stimulated with s. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus cowan i and pokeweed mitogen.  in the experiments using tonsillar cell subsets, the cytokine inductions by alpha-streptococcal stimulus were found in monocyte-depleted cells as well as in  purified t-cells. but not in b-cells. these data suggest that il-6, ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha may play an important role in immunological reactions in the tonsils and that a hyper-immune response to some of alpha-streptococcal antigens through  increased production of such cytokines by tonsillar mononuclear cells, to which t-cells mainly contribute, may play a key role in the pathogenesis of ppp.

TI  == increased levels of transforming growth factor beta 1 and basic fibroblast growth factor in patients on capd: a study during non-infected steady state and peritonitis.
AB  == long-term influence of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (capd) on concentrations of transforming growth factor beta1 (tgf-beta1) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bfgf) in the peritoneal effluent, and the effect of peritonitis on these cytokines were investigated. tgf-beta1 and bfgf were assayed in effluent samples from dialysate bags collected during the initial week of treatment with capd and at 5 months. to determine the effect of peritonitis, dialysate bags were collected on admission to the hospital and on days 3 and 10 and also during non-infected steady state. serum was drawn prior to infection and on days 1 and 10. tgf-beta1 increased more than threefold during the longitudinal follow-up period, median concentrations of 35 pg/ml to 106 pg/ml (p<0.05). no change in bfgf was seen during this initial 5 months. tgf-beta1 was increased on  the first day of peritonitis (median concentration 169 pg/ml) and reached its maximum on day 3 of infection, (median concentration 216 pg/ml) (p<0.05 vs non-infected state, median concentration 39 pg/ml). basic fgf reached a maximum on day three of infection (median concentration 7.7 pg/ml; p=0.01 vs non-infected state) and then slowly declined. in conclusion, tgf-beta1 is influenced by capd treatment per se, and together with bfgf is increased during peritonitis, indicating its importance in the peritoneum and its potential involvement in the  development of tissue fibrosis and eventually ultrafiltration failure.

TI  == efficacy of trovafloxacin in treatment of experimental staphylococcal or streptococcal endocarditis.
AB  == the efficacy of trovafloxacin against staphylococcus aureus and viridans group streptococci was investigated in vitro and in an experimental model of endocarditis. the mics at which trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin inhibited 90% of  clinical isolates of such bacteria (mic90s) were (i) 0.03 and 2 mg/liter, respectively, for 30 ciprofloxacin-susceptible s. aureus isolates, (ii) 32 and 128 mg/liter, respectively, for 20 ciprofloxacin-resistant s. aureus isolates, and (iii) 0.25 and 8 mg/liter, respectively, for 28 viridans group streptococci.  rats with aortic vegetations were infected with either of two ciprofloxacin-susceptible but methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains (strains col and p8), one penicillin-susceptible streptococcus sanguis strain, or one penicillin-resistant streptococcus mitis strain. rats were treated for 3 or 5 days with doses that resulted in kinetics that simulated those achieved in humans with trovafloxacin (200 mg orally once a day), ciprofloxacin (750 mg orally twice a day), vancomycin (1 g intravenously twice a day), or ceftriaxone (2 g intravenously once a day). against the staphylococci, the activities of both trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin were equivalent to that of vancomycin, and treatment of endocarditis with these drugs was successful (p < 0.05). however, ciprofloxacin selected for resistant derivatives in vitro and in vivo, whereas trovafloxacin was 10 to 100 times less prone than ciprofloxacin to select for resistance in vitro and did not select for resistance in vivo. against the two streptococcal isolates, trovafloxacin significantly (p < 0.05) decreased bacterial counts in the vegetations but was less effective than the control drug, ceftriaxone. thus, a simulated oral dose of trovafloxacin (200 mg per day) was effective against ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylococci and was less likely than ciprofloxacin to select for resistance. the simulated oral dose of trovafloxacin also had some activity against streptococcal endocarditis, but optimal treatment of infections caused by such organisms might require higher doses of the drug.

TI  == detection of bacteraemia in patients with fever and neutropenia using 16s rrna gene amplification by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == episodes of fever and neutropenia are common complications of treatment for cancer. the use of prophylactic and early empirical antibiotics has reduced mortality but decreases the sensitivity of diagnostic tests based on culture. the aim of this study was to determine the potential of a broad diagnostic approach (eubacterial) based on 16s rrna gene amplification and sequencing to augment cultural methods of diagnosis of bacteraemia in patients with fever and neutropenia in a regional paediatric oncology centre. one hundred eleven patient-episodes of fever and neutropenia were evaluated during the study period, 17 of which were associated with positive blood cultures, as follows: staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 6 episodes), enterococcus faecium (n = 2), streptococcus sanguis (n = 3), streptococcus mitis (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), micrococcus spp. (n = 1), and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 1). eubacterial polymerase chain reaction (pcr) detected bacterial dna in nine of 11  blood culture-positive episodes for which a sample was available for pcr; the species identified by sequence analysis were identical to those derived from the  conventional identification of the cultured isolates. bacterial dna was detected  in 20 episodes (21 bacterial sequences) associated with negative blood cultures,  18 of which occurred in patients who were receiving antibiotics at the time of sample collection. the species presumptively identified by partial 16s rrna gene  sequencing were as follows: pseudomonas spp. (n = 6 episodes), acinetobacter spp. (n =5 ); escherichia spp. (n = 3); moraxella spp. (n = 3); staphylococcus spp. (n = 2); neisseria spp. (n = 1); and bacillus spp. (n = 1). the results of this study suggest that molecular techniques can augment cultural methods in the diagnosis of bacteraemia in patients who have been treated with antibiotics.

TI  == external quality assessment of the serum bactericidal test: results of a methodology/interpretation questionnaire.
AB  == two hundred microbiology laboratories in the uk took part in two separate experimental external quality assessment distributions related to the serum bactericidal test (sbt). in the first, staphylococcus aureus nctc 6571 (vancomycin mic 1 mg/l), was tested against a human serum containing vancomycin 38 mg/l plus gentamicin 0.5 mg/l. in the second, streptococcus oralis paj 112/4183 (penicillin mbc < or = 0.03 mg/l) and streptococcus sanguis paj 107/4184 (penicillin mbc = 128 mg/l) were tested against human serum containing penicillin 15 mg/l. respondents returned their laboratory results and a questionnaire on clinical interpretation and technical aspects. most laboratories (194/199, 97.5%) recommend the use of the sbt in the management of infective endocarditis but only 48 (25.2%) often or always change therapy on the basis of the result. a wide range of interpretative criteria, definitions of bactericidal endpoints and methodologies are used. performance in the first distribution was acceptable for  75% of laboratories but in the second only 34% could identify penicillin tolerance; 34 respondents reported an sbt result of < or = 2 for the tolerant strain, 81 laboratories reported one of > or = 16. technical factors related to acceptable performance were: sonication of broth before counting the inoculum; knowing the inoculum size in cfu/ml; use of a 4-8 h broth culture to make the inoculum; incubation of recovery plates for > 36 h; use of a calibrated pipette to sample for surviving bacteria; use of measured volumes to add the inoculum. use of uncalibrated pipettes or standard loops to recover survivors was related to poor performance. microbiology departments in the uk should review the clinical need to perform the sbt in the light of their local circumstances and if they elect to continue to offer this test, revise their methodologies which could be producing misleading results when testing alpha-haemolytic streptococci.

AB  == background: infective endocarditis is a systemic disease in which there are a continuously antigenic stimulation of immunologic system. streptococcus is still  the most frequent cause of infective endocarditis. patients and methods: we investigated the presence of antibody (ab), total and igm by indirect immune fluorescence technique, in four groups of population: streptococcal infective endocarditis (sie), streptococcal bacteraemia (sb), staphylococcus aureus endocarditis, and healthy people. antigens used were: 1) their own strain isolated from the blood of patients with sie and sb inverted question markhomologous ab inverted question mark, and; 2) seven species of streptococcus: streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus sanguis i, streptococcus sanguis ii, nutritional dependent streptococci and enterococcus faecalis (heterologous ab). results: homologous antibodies: titers > or = 1/512 were found in all patients with sie and only in 2 with sb (sensitivity 100% and specificity 93%). igm titer (threshold 1/32) was positive only in patients with sie (sensitivity 75,5% and specificity 100%). the  fall of the ab titer was continuous and slow, despite the good clinical evolution of patients. (ab titers were > or = 1/512 and igm > or = 1/64 in 30% of patients  1 year later). heterologous ab: in spite of statistically significant difference  found in sie versus the other groups, sensitivity of this test (threshold 1/256)  is low, confidence interval include expected random value (50%), specificity is 88%. conclusions: the utility of homologous ab for diagnosing infective endocarditis is demonstrated. on the contrary for heterologous ab, antigenic common fractions must be found in the different species.

TI  == treatment of endocarditis with teicoplanin: a retrospective analysis of 104 cases.
AB  == infective endocarditis is an uncommon disease but retains a high mortality. glycopeptides are used for patients with resistant pathogens, those allergic to penicillins or for those outside the hospital. the once daily administration of teicoplanin and its low toxicity suggest that it would be suitable for use in the long courses required for endocarditis. however, the dosage and combinations to be used require further study. a retrospective review has been made of 104 episodes of endocarditis treated with teicoplanin in 101 patients seen over 7 years. most patients had been referred to major london hospitals following failure of medical treatment. after three loading doses of 400 mg, teicoplanin was given at a dose of 400 mg/day in combination with other antibiotics such as gentamicin. follow up was for one year. the most common pathogens were streptococcus sanguis (15 cases), staphylococcus aureus (13 cases) and staphylococcus epidermidis (10 cases). of 80 patients febrile at the start of treatment with teicoplanin, 63 (79%) lost their fever within a median of 2 days (1-35 days). cure without surgery was effected in 50 (48%) and 75% of patients survived. other antibiotics, usually gentamicin or rifampicin, were used in 92 (90%) of patients. two strains of streptococcus spp. were said to be resistant but there was no relationship between mic of teicoplanin and outcome. pathogens with a high mbc tended to be more likely to resist treatment. adverse effects resulted in the withdrawal of teicoplanin in 20 cases (19%) but most events were  mild and renal deterioration occurred in only five patients. teicoplanin was effective in the treatment of endocarditis and appeared to be safe given the severity of disease in the patients treated.

TI  == influence of lipoteichoic acid structure on recognition by the macrophage scavenger receptor.
AB  == lipoteichoic acids (ltas) belong to the immunostimulatory class of molecules of gram-positive bacteria (gpb). previous investigations showed that the macrophage  scavenger receptor (sr), a glycosylated trimeric transmembrane protein, binds directly to many gpb, possibly via lta. sr binding to other ligands is dependent  upon the spatial characteristics of the repeating negative charge of the ligand.  we therefore investigated sr recognition of lta species with various charge densities and distributions by determining the capacity of these ltas to compete  with the binding of metabolically labeled sr to beads coated with the known sr ligand polyguanylic acid. staphylococcus aureus lta, a classical lta type (unbranched 1,3-linked polyglycerophosphate chain covalently bound to a membrane  diacylglyceroglycolipid), had a 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50) for inhibition of sr binding of 0.84 microg/ml. when the s. aureus lta was rendered more negatively charged by removal of ester-linked alanine from the polyglycerophosphate backbone, the ic50 dropped to 0.23 microg/ml. other polyglycerophosphate ltas from enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae, listeria monocytogenes, listeria welshimeri, and streptococcus sanguis showed ic50s of 0.5 to 2.1 microg/ml, supporting the role of negative charge in binding to sr. accordingly, the zwitterionic lta of streptococcus pneumoniae and clostridium innocuum lta substituted with positively charged sugar residues had no binding capacity. monoglycerophosphate branches, but not succinyl ester, affected binding of lipoglycans. the data presented above parallel the previous findings for whole organisms and support the role of surface-associated lta as a major ligand of gpb for binding to sr. whether binding of lta and whole gpb to macrophages initiates uptake and degradation or results in signal transduction remains to be determined.

AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the predisposing conditions and etiology of infective endocarditis (ie) in icelandic children during the last ten years from 1984 to 1993. records from all cases of ie in iceland during this period were sampled. vegetations were confirmed in all patients by echocardiography and  in cases of culture negative ie the diagnosis was made on clinical grounds and on the response to antibiotic treatment. during this period eight children were diagnosed with ie. five of these cases occurred in a cluster during a two months  period last year (1993). four patients had a known heart defect, three had a central venous catheter (cvc) and one patient had no factors known to predispose  ie. the most common site of infection was the tricuspid valve seen in six cases,  one in the aortic valve and one in the aortic arch. all patients survived without neurological sequel. a positive blood culture was obtained in six cases. the infective organisms were staphylococcus aureus (three patients), staphylococcus epidermitis (one patient), streptococcus sanguis (one patient) and candida albicans (one patient). the results show that the spectrum of ie in icelandic children is similar to the changing spectrum elsewhere where infected cvc's are now responsible for relatively high proportion of the cases. this is most likely  due to greater use of cvc's especially in neonatal intensive care units. a relatively few cases of typical ie, i.e. in children with an underlying heart lesion or following cardiac surgery, suggests effective prophylactic therapy and  follow up.

AB  == the aim of the present study was to compare two methods for estimation of bacterial growth interference between various bacteria using a bioscreen robot analyzer, allowing kinetic documentation, and a cocultivation test on blood agar  plates. six laboratory strains with different virulence and growth requirements were used: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus mitis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. the interference activity was correlated with a reference system of streptococcus sanguis (strain alpha 89) and streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococci, gas serotypes t 9 and t 22). the methods used and results obtained were as follows: 1. estimation of synergistic and antagonistic bacterial interferences using a bioscreen robot analyzer. suspensions of viable bacteria were added to microtiter plates with different concentrations of uv light-killed bacteria in liquid media. the bioscreen analyzer monitored bacterial growth every 10 min for 24 h giving kinetic data during the growth period. synergisms as well as antagonisms were demonstrated between the tested bacterial  strains which have not earlier been reported in the literature. however, the antagonistic effect observed between the six strains was less than that induced by the s. sanguis strain on the two strains of s. pyogenes. 2. cocultivation of bacterial strains on blood agar surface with precultivated or simultaneously stamped interfering bacteria indicated no detectable interference between the six tested bacterial strains, while the s. sanguis strain inhibited the growth of s.  pyogenes strains as well as the hemolysis around the colonies. the bioscreen method was found more sensitive for testing bacterial interference compared to the commonly used blood agar test.

TI  == hospital practices influence the pattern of infective endocarditis.
AB  == objective: to identify factors contributing to infective endocarditis at a major  teaching hospital. methods: retrospective review of clinical records of patients  diagnosed with endocarditis by standard case definitions with respect to causative organisms, clinical features and outcome. results: one hundred and ninety-three episodes of endocarditis seen between 1979 and 1992 at westmead hospital, sydney, were reviewed. in the 174 cases where the causative organism was isolated, 75 (43%) were staphylococcus aureus and 50 (29%) were viridans streptococci. nosocomial acquisition and/or inter-hospital transfer accounted for 83 episodes; 48 (58%) s. aureus (p < 0.001) and nine (11%) viridans streptococci  (p < 0.001). in cases from the local community, viridans streptococci were more common than s. aureus (37% versus 25%); these included 18 episodes (14 s. aureus) in intravenous drug users. conclusion: we conclude that, compared with community-acquired infections, the aetiology of endocarditis in a large teaching  hospital is influenced strongly by the prevalence of nosocomial endocarditis and  the need for interhospital transfer of complicated cases.

AB  == obstructive pneumonitis, the opacity that develops distal to an obstructing endobronchial lesion or external compression, is actually a combination of atelectasis, bronchiectasis with mucus plugging, and true parenchymal inflammation. in the majority of cases, it is usually not possible to determine whether infection is present or not from the radiographic findings alone. the aim of this study was to evaluate the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis and the influence of this result on the treatment of patients. from march 1992 to february 1993, 26 consecutive patients (20 men and six women) with obstructive pneumonitis were investigated. the obstructive pneumonitis had been caused by malignant tumors in 24 and benign lesions in two. chest ultrasound (us) and us-guided percutaneous transthoracic aspirations were undergone to obtain specimens for microbiologic examination. microorganisms were isolated from seven  of nine febrile patients and two of 17 nonfebrile patients. a total of 16 bacterial strains are detected in obstructive pneumonitis (pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, viridant streptococci, bacteroides fragilis, two peptostreptococcus species, mycobacterium tuberculosis, pseudomonas maltophilia, streptococcus sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides thetaiotamomicrons, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides species, veillonella species, aerobic gram-positive bacilli, and escherichia coli). in five cases the  isolates were monobacteriae, and in the remaining four cases, cultures yielded more than one bacteria. the results of aspirate cultures led to changes in the initial antibiotic trial in seven of nine patients, and fever subsided thereafter. pneumothorax occurred in one cases as the sole complication. the pathogen causing obstructive pneumonitis is very heterogeneous, and polymicrobial infection is common.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == microorganisms on toothbrushes at day-care centers.
AB  == the microflora on 44 toothbrushes at 4 day-care centers in the city of goteborg have been investigated as a presumptive risk factor for transmission of microorganisms by children. non-supervised toothbrushing without the use of toothpaste was performed at the day-care centers twice a day. streptococci, predominantly s. salivarius, s. sanguis, and s. mitis, were the most frequently recorded group of microorganisms and generally constituted the greatest part of the flora (on average, 50%). beta-hemolytic streptococci were not found in any sample. haemophilus species were noted in 82% of the samples. h. parainfluenzae being the most frequent, and h. influenzae being identified in only one sample. anaerobes constituted on average a third of the microflora. staphylococci were identified in 86% of the samples, s. epidermidis dominating. fungi including molds were found in 50% of the samples, and from one day-care center large numbers of enteric organisms were identified. thus this study shows that unsupervised toothbrushing at day-care centers can be questioned, more from a general hygienic point of view than from the risk of transmitting serious pathogens.

TI  == in vivo activities and penetration of the two components of the streptogramin rp  59500 in cardiac vegetations of experimental endocarditis.
AB  == we evaluated the in vivo activity and the diffusion of radiolabelled rp 57669 (rpi) and rp 54476 (rpii), the two components of the injectable streptogramin rp  59500, alone or in combination, in aortic vegetations from experimental endocarditis in rabbits. rpi and rpii demonstrated in vitro bacteriostatic and bactericidal synergy against a clinical strain of staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin and susceptible to erythromycin. in experimental staphylococcal endocarditis, rp 59500 was as effective as vancomycin and significantly more effective than rpi (p < 0.01) and rpii (p < 0.05). autoradiography studies showed different patterns of distribution into cardiac vegetations infected with streptococcus sanguis for [14c]rpi and [14c]rpii. [14c]rpi was homogeneously distributed throughout the vegetations whereas [14c]rpii showed a decreasing gradient of concentration between the periphery and the core of the vegetation, with an approximately 2:1 ratio. [14c]rpi diffused approximately 2 to 4 times more than [14c]rpii into the core of the vegetations. since the injected ratio of rpi and rpii is 30:70 in rp 59500, the actual rpi:rpii ratio in the core of the vegetation may range from 0.8 to 1.7, a ratio which remains compatible with the in vivo synergism demonstrated between the two components.

TI  == molecular characterization of a plasmid-borne (pgt633) erythromycin resistance determinant (ermgt) from lactobacillus reuteri 100-63.
AB  == lactobacillus reuteri 100-63 contains a 9.8 kb plasmid (pgt633) encoding resistance to the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (mls) type b antibiotics. the restriction endonucleases acci, bamhi, bcli, ecori, ecorv, hhai, hindii, hpai, kpni, sali, and sspi were employed to establish a physical map of pgt633. next, genetic transfer experiments were conducted to establish the host range of  pgt633. the results revealed that pgt633 replicated autonomously and encoded constitutive resistance to erythromycin in a variety of bacterial hosts, including bacillus subtilis bd170, streptococcus sanguis dl1, staphylococcus aureus rn4220, and enterococcus faecalis 19433, as well as several lactobacillus  spp. a 2.2 kb bamhi fragment of pgt633 containing the genetic determinant (ermgt) encoding resistance to erythromycin was cloned into escherichia coli. determination of the nucleotide sequence of ermgt revealed a methylase gene 731 bp in length that was highly related (ca. 81% nucleotide and ca. 78% amino acid identity) to the ermc gene from s. aureus plasmid pe194. the leader sequences of  ermgt and ermc were identical except for a single base change at nt 51.

TI  == novel automated microbial screening of platelet concentrates.
AB  == the recovery of bacteria and the speed of detection of microbial growth in platelet concentrates (pc) were studied, comparing a novel automated blood culture system (bact/alert) with two traditional methods. full-scale experiments  were performed with a total of 33 units of pc (average content 320 x 10(9) platelets per unit) obtained from pooled buffy coats. six strains known as possible pc contaminants were tested: s. epidermidis, s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, b. cereus, e. aerogenes, and s. sanguis. using an inoculum of 50-98 bacteria/ml,  bacterial contamination was detected in all of 11 pcs on 132 sampling occasions.  with a small inoculum (0.3-9 bacteria/ml), the bacterial contamination was detected in all pcs in which abundant growth appeared, but failed to be detected  in some instances where the bacterial content was very small. all of 11 uninoculated pc controls were negative. with the automated method the time for detection of a culture-positive pc was 6-16 h, clearly shorter than with the two  manual-visual systems. the new system provides a rapid, reliable, and labour-saving method for screening of bacterial contamination in pcs. this would  increase safety particularly if the present 5-day shelf life were extended.

TI  == low surface tension calcium hydroxide solution is an effective antiseptic.
AB  == the antimicrobial effects of a saturated calcium hydroxide solution, and in combination with 10% and 20% detergent, were evaluated on streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, neisseria  sp., diphtheroid, staphylococcus aureus, lactobacillus sp., staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis and candida albicans. the saturated calcium hydroxide solution was effective against only four of the 11 microorganisms studied over a 60-min exposure time. the calcium hydroxide solutions containing detergent killed all 11 test organisms over a 30-min exposure time. this difference was statistically significant (p < 0.01). no statistically significant difference in antimicrobial action was found between the 10% and 20% detergent calcium hydroxide solutions (p > 0.01). however, the low surface tension (46.5 x  10(-3) nm-1) and high ph (10.8) of the calcium hydroxide solution with 20% detergent establish it as the more effective solution.

TI  == role of serum antibodies to streptococci in patients with iga nephropathy.
AB  == serum antibodies to whole cells of streptococci and serum immune complexes were investigated in patients with iga nephropathy accompanied by tonsillitis and in healthy adult controls by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). serum iga levels to streptococcus salivarius, s. sanguis i and s. pneumoniae were higher in patients with iga nephropathy than in healthy controls. the levels of igg to s. pyogenes t12, s. gordonii and s. sanguis ii in patients with iga nephropathy were also higher than in healthy controls. serum immune complexes of igg and iga were  higher in patients with iga nephropathy than in healthy controls. serum levels of iga to some strains of streptococci tended to correlate with the level of iga immune complex in both patients and healthy controls. these results suggest that  antibodies to some strains of streptococci play a role in the pathogenesis of iga nephropathy.

TI  == [etiology of bacterial endocarditis in materials from cardiology and cardiac surgery clinics of the lodz academy].
AB  == in the years 1986-1991, 72 cases of bacterial endocarditis (be) were investigated. the bacteria were isolated from blood in 24 cases, from native and  artificial valves obtained during surgery in 24 cases, and from both blood and valves in 6 cases. following microorganisms were isolated: s. epidermidis, s. xylosus, s. hominis, s. aureus, micrococcus sp., s. mitis, s. sanguis, s. faecalis, m. lacunata, e. adecarboxylata, p. maltophila, corynebacterium sp., a.  calcoaceticus var. lwoffii, and aspergillus sp. gram-positive bacteria were prevailing among isolated strains. staphylococci were present in 55.7% (29 cases) and among them coagulase-negative staphylococci occurred in 89.7% (26 cases). streptococci were isolated from 9 patients (17.3%) and gram-negative rods from 5  patients (9.65%). coryneform bacteria were detected in 7 cases (13.5%). there was no relation between type of removed valve and colonizing it bacteria. from native and artificial valves coagulase-negative staphylococci were isolated, respectively, in 48.3% and 52.2%. susceptibility of isolated bacteria to 27 antibiotics was determined. multiple resistant strains were present most frequently among staphylococci.

AB  == an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) was developed for measurement of the antibody response to exocellular protein antigens of staphylococcus aureus. the wells of a microtitre plate were coated with the exocellular proteins present in  the tryptic soya broth growth medium from a stationary phase culture of a bone infection strain of s. aureus. the wells were then reacted sequentially with patient sera, protein a-peroxidase conjugate and chromogenic substrate. serum from patients with s. aureus bone infection gave a significantly higher igg titre than sera from patients with staphylococcus epidermidis or streptococcus sanguis  bone infection or healthy uninfected individuals. the assay therefore appears to  have potential in the serodiagnosis of s. aureus bone infection.

TI  == macrophage response to bacteria: induction of marked secretory and cellular activities by lipoteichoic acids.
AB  == lipoteichoic acids (ltas) from various bacterial species, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and listeria monocytogenes, were examined for the ability  to induce secretory and cellular responses in a pure population of bone marrow-derived mononuclear phagocytes. some of the highly purified ltas, in particular ltas from bacillus subtilis, s. pyogenes, e. faecalis, and enterococcus hirae, were able to affect each of the macrophage parameters measured, i.e., reductive capacity, secretion of tumor necrosis factor and nitrite, and tumoricidal activity. as after stimulation with whole organisms or other bacterial products, secretion of tumor necrosis factor induced by these ltas reached its maximum within the first few hours of the interaction, while secretion of nitrite and tumoricidal activity required 24 to 36 h for full expression. other purified ltas, i.e., ltas from streptococcus sanguis, s. pneumoniae, and l. monocytogenes, as well as lipomannan from micrococcus luteus affected only some of these parameters, while native lta from s. aureus was inactive. there was no obvious correlation between biological activity and chain  length, kind of glycosyl substituents, glycolipid structures, or fatty acid composition of ltas. deacylation of ltas resulted in a complete loss of activity, and deacylated ltas did not impair the activity of their acylated counterparts, suggesting that acyl chains may be essential for binding of lta to the cell surface. the results demonstrate that some lta species are potent inducers of macrophage secretory and cellular activities.

AB  == during a two-year period data were collected nationwide in the netherlands on 438 episodes of bacterial endocarditis (be) in 432 patients. of the strains isolated  in these patients 419 were available for analysis. of these, 326 were isolated in native valve endocarditis (nve) and 93 in prosthetic valve endocarditis (pve). viridans streptococci, staphylococci and enterococci together constituted 87% of  the isolates. more than 46% of the viridans streptococci consisted of streptococcus sanguis. enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus were the predominant species in the late form of pve. the majority of the viridans streptococci and haemolytic streptococci were highly susceptible to penicillin. five of 35 strains of coagulase negative staphylococci were resistant to methicillin. eleven percent of a random sample of the streptococci collected were tolerant to penicillin. after repeated exposure to a concentration gradient of an appropriate beta-lactam antibiotic, this figure increased to 49%. of the staphylococci, 5-6% of the strains were tolerant before induction and 16-20% after induction. of the enterococcus strains (n = 40), 12.5% showed high-level resistance to one or more aminoglycoside.

TI  == cloning and nucleotide base sequence analysis of a spectinomycin adenyltransferase aad(9) determinant from enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis ldr55, a human clinical isolate, is resistant to tetracycline (tcr), erythromycin (emr), and high levels (greater than 2,000 micrograms/ml) of spectinomycin (spr) but not streptomycin. filter matings between strain ldr55 and e. faecalis og1-rf produced transconjugants with the following resistance phenotypes: tcr emr spr, tcr emr, tcr spr, and tcr only but  never emr or spr only. the genetic determinant encoding resistance to spectinomycin was cloned in streptococcus sanguis challis from pdl55, a 26-kb plasmid harbored by a tcr spr transconjugant. subcloning experiments yielded a 1.1-kb clai-ndei fragment that encoded very high-level spr in s. sanguis (10 mg/ml) and escherichia coli (50 mg/ml). cell extracts of cultures obtained from spr strains expressed adenylating activity for spectinomycin but not for streptomycin, indicating that spr was due to an aad(9) activity. the nucleotide base sequence of the 1.1-kb clai-ndei fragment contained a single 750-base open reading frame. the protein predicted from the open reading frame consisted of 250 amino acids and had a calculated size of approximately 28,000 daltons, similar to the size estimated from maxicell analysis (29,000 daltons). the deduced amino acid sequence of the streptococcal aad(9) was compared with that of the aad(9) encoded by staphylococcal transposon tn554. the two proteins shared approximately 39% amino acid identity, which was expanded to 53% when conservative amino acid changes were included. when the streptococcal protein was compared with an aad(3")(9) protein of e. coli, the degrees of identity were 27 and 47%, on the basis of actual amino acids and conservative replacements, respectively. the cloning and nucleotide base sequence analyses of the spectinomycin aad(9) determinant from e. faecalis that results in high-level spr when transferred to s. sanguis or e. coli are presented.

AB  == the adherence of bacteria to sutures used in cardiac surgery was studied by in vitro quantitative determination with [3h]-leucine-labeled staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus sanguis. the adherence per unit area for staphylococci was least for monofilament polypropylene (prolene), 3 times higher (p less than 0.05) for braided polyester (mersiline) and greatest (10 times, p less than 0.005) for braided polyester sutures coated with polybutylate (ethibond). mean values for the adherence of streptococci were low for all the sutures. sutures pretreated with human plasma showed a 12-37% increase in bacterial adherence. the cell surface hydrophobicity, surface charge  and the haemagglutinating property of bacteria did not correlate with their adherence property. in view of these observations, it is suggested that: (a) the  preferential adherence of staphylococci to intra-cardiac sutures may be one of the explanations for its being the commonest cause of early prosthetic valve endocarditis, (b) there is a need for a careful selection of sutures used in cardiac surgery and (c) the described in vitro assay for bacterial adherence may  be used for monitoring the development of better designed sutures and the effect  of incorporation of antibiotics in the sutures.

TI  == [selection of constitutive mutants of gram-positive cocci inducible resistant to  macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins (mls): comparison of the selective effects of the mls].
AB  == mutation frequencies to constitutive resistance were determined for 7 strains inducible resistant to the mls antibiotics (5 staphylococcus aureus, 1 group g streptococcus and 1 streptococcus sanguis). in the 5 staphylococcal strains, mutants were generally selected at a frequency of 10(-9) to 10(-10) (ranging from 4.10(-8) to 9.10(-11) on plates containing 50 mg/l of the following non-inducer mls: spiramycin, josamycin, midecamycin, miocamycin, lincomycin, clindamycin, and pristinamycin factor i (pi). no mutant was selected by 50 mg/l of pristinamycin factor ii (pii) or by pristinamycin complex (p). absence of selection of constitutive mutant by p was due to the low mics of the antibiotic against the constitutively resistant strains and to the effect of pii: the emergence of the mutants constitutively resistant to pi was prevented by a 6-hour contact of the culture with pii (50 mg/l). mics and mbcs of the pristinamycin against 9 constitutive mutants were respectively 2 to 4-fold and 2 to 8-fold greater than that against the wild-strains. in the streptococci, no constituvely resistant mutant was selected. therefore, the risk of selection of resistant mutants by a non inducer mls in the course of the treatment of infections due to inducible resistant staphylococcus appeared to be low, especially in the case of pristinamycin.

TI  == secretory expression in escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis of human interferon alpha genes directed by staphylokinase signals.
AB  == a dna segment covering the signal sequence coding region, the ribosome binding site, and the promoter of the staphylokinase (sak) 42d gene (behnke and gerlach 1987) was cloned into puc19 to form a portable expression-secretion unit (esu). fusion of human interferon alpha 1 (hifn alpha 1) and hybrid hifn alpha 1/2 genes to this sak esu resulted in secretory expression of the two gene products in both escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis. while most of the ifn alpha was exported  to the periplasmic space of e. coli, about 99% was secreted to the culture medium by recombinant b. subtilis strains. the total yield in e. coli was 1.2 x 10(5) iu/ml. this level of expression and export led to instability of the recombinant  strains that was spontaneously relieved in vivo by inactivation of the sak esu through insertion of an is1 element. no such instability was observed with b. subtilis although expression and secretion levels reached even 3 x 10(6) iu/ml. proteolytic degradation of ifn alpha by extracellular proteases was avoided by a  combination of constitutive expression and secretion during the logarithmic growth phase and the use of exoprotease-reduced host strains. the ifn alpha 1 protein purified from b. subtilis culture supernatant was correctly processed, carried the expected 11 amino acid n-terminal elongation that resulted from dna manipulations and proved to be homogenous in western blotting experiments. the same recombinant plasmid that directed efficient secretion of hifn alpha 1 in b.  subtilis gave poor yields when introduced into streptococcus sanguis.

TI  == transferable vancomycin and teicoplanin resistance in enterococcus faecium.
AB  == enterococcus faecium bm4165 and bm4178, isolated from immunocompromised patients, one treated with vancomycin, were inducibly resistant to high levels of the glycopeptide antibiotics vancomycin and teicoplanin but susceptible to the new lipopeptide daptomycin (ly146032). strain bm4165 was also resistant to macrolidelincosamide-streptogramin b-type (mls) antibiotics. the genes conferring resistance to glycopeptides and to mls antibiotics in strain bm4165 were carried  on plasmids pip819 and pip821, respectively; pip819 also carried genes that encoded resistance to mls antibiotics. the two plasmids, which were distinct although related, were self-transferable to other e. faecium strains. plasmid pip819 could also conjugate to e. faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, s. pyogenes, s. lactis, and listeria monocytogenes, in which it conferred inducible glycopeptide resistance, but not to s. aureus. glycopeptide-inactivating activity was not detected, and the biochemical mechanism of resistance remains unknown. based on this first report of transferable resistance to glycopeptides, we anticipate dissemination of resistance to these antibiotics in gram-positive cocci and bacilli in which it can be phenotypically expressed.

AB  == this study was performed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and the safety of sultamicillin (sbtpc) fine granules in the treatment of patients with meibomianitis. a dose of 375 mg sbtpc granules was orally given to 10 patients with meibomianitis after each meal, three times a day. the results obtained are summarized as follows. efficacies were rated as good in 7 cases, fair in 2 and poor in 1 with an efficacy ratio of 70.0%. no side effects were observed throughout the study. the organisms isolated were gram-positive bacteria such as  staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, coagulase negative staphylococcus and streptococcus sanguis, and gram-negative bacteria such as alcaligenes denitrificans subsp. denitrificans, alcaligenes denitrificans subsp.  xylosoxidans, xanthomonas maltophilia and acinetobacter lwoffii. a bacteriological study showed lower mics of sbtpc than those of ampicillin (abpc), suggesting that sbtpc has more potent antibacterial activity than abpc. such bacteriological activity of sbtpc was well reflected in its clinical efficacy; the drug was effective in patients with infections caused by organisms moderately or highly resistant to abpc or cefaclor.

TI  == antibiotic resistance and production of inhibitory substances among bacterial strains isolated from the oral cavities of balb/c mice.
AB  == in the oral cavities of balb/c mice, microbial population levels are regulated by multifactorial processes. factors include the production of inhibitory substances and the exchange of genetic material. in this work, 371 isolates from different sites (saliva, tongue, teeth, and mucosa) of the oral cavities of balb/c mice were screened for resistance to antibiotics and antimicrobial activity. antibiotic-resistant strains represented 25% of the total flora. among the predominant species, all the s. faecalis isolates showed multiresistance, and 23% of the lactobacillus murinus isolates and 15% of the staphylococcus aureus were resistant to at least one antibiotic. resistance to aminoglycosides (neomycin, streptomycin, kanamycin, and gentamicin) was most frequently encountered. in s. faecalis, high levels of resistance were recorded to neomycin and streptomycin but not to gentamicin or kanamycin. macrolides (m), lincosamides (l), streptogramin b (s), tetracycline (tc), and chloramphenicol (cm) resistance was also present in multiresistance patterns, especially among s. faecalis isolates.  hemolytic (hly+) streptococci were less resistant to mls, tc, and cm than were non-hemolytic (hly-) isolates. resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics was detected only among staphylococci and with a low prevalence (4%). the frequencies of strains producing antimicrobial substances against the indicator strains (s. mutans lg-1, s. sanguis ny 101, and a. viscosus ny 1) were high for l. murinus (76%) and s. faecalis (57% for hly- and 90% for hly+), but low for s. aureus (7%). these results indicate that the indigenous oral flora could interfere with  colonization by allochthonous micro-organisms and that resistance patterns should be taken into account for the elimination of the oral indigenous flora by antibiotic treatment.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == three strains of staphylococcus aureus, serotype 18, cowan i and serotype 66438,  and different species of streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes, str, mutans, str.  sanguis and str. faecalis) were tested for their adherence to buccal cells (as measured by interference contrast microscopy) and phagocytosis by rat polymorphonuclear leucocytes (pmns) (as measured by fluorescence microscopy with  a vital fluorochrome, acridine orange). pretreatment of cocci with serial two-fold dilutions of spiramycin (from 1/2 to 1/1024 the mic), increased the diameter of bacterial cells and decreased the adherence of staphylococci and streptococci to buccal cells. exposure of streptococci to 1/4 the mic of spiramycin led to an increase of the phagocytic capacity of pmns. pretreatment of pmns with a therapeutic concentration (2 mg/l) also stimulated the phagocytosis of streptococci. action of spiramycin on the phagocytosis of staphylococci varied according to the strain tested. although in-vitro results cannot be directly compared with in-vivo data, it is of interest that spiramycin decreases adherence of different gram-positive cocci and enhances phagocytic capacity of pmns.

AB  == rats with periodontitis and catheter-induced aortic valve vegetations underwent dental extractions. cultures of blood obtained 1 min later showed polymicrobial bacteremia in 19 of 19 rats, mostly due to viridans streptococci (18 of 19), morganella (15 of 19), group g streptococci (13 of 19), and staphylococcus aureus (10 of 19). viridans streptococci circulated in higher numbers than did group g streptococci and s. aureus (p less than .01). three days after dental extractions, 18 of 20 rats had endocarditis. fifteen (83%) of 18 infections were  due to group g streptococci, 9 (50%) of 18 were due to s. aureus, and 2 (11%) of  18 were due to viridans streptococci (p less than .05). in vitro, adherence to platelet-fibrin matrices of endocarditis strain 8 of group g streptococcus was two times greater than that of endocarditis strain s. aureus 23 and three to four times greater than that of streptococcus sanguis 44 and morganella morganii 93 (p less than 10(-5)). the inoculum size that produced endocarditis in 90% of rats after iv challenge was 10(5) cfu for group g streptococcus strain 8 and 10(7) for s. sanguis 44.

AB  == the bactericidal activity of teicoplanin was studied in a model system in which antibiotic concentration is continuously varied. a two-compartment open model was used to reproduce, in vitro serum pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin in humans during 24 h after iv administration. staphylococcal and streptococcal strains of  various species were tested. teicoplanin showed rapid killing of staphylococcus epidermidis and staph. hominis. all strains of staph. epidermidis were rapidly killed in spite of the high mic values (4-16 mg/l). the killing effect against staph. haemolyticus was less rapid and marked than against staph. epidermidis, with strain to strain variation. a 99.9% kill was achieved for most strains within 22 h, but with other isolates regrowth occurred which was due to the presence of highly resistant cells in the original population. other staphylococci (staph. aureus, staph. saprophyticus) and streptococcus pyogenes, str. bovis and str. salivarius were reduced by 99.9% within 22 h. bactericidal activity against other streptococci (str. mutans, str. agalactiae, str. faecalis, str. faecium) was less marked; against str. sanguis teicoplanin was bacteriostatic.

TI  == cloning and expression in escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis, and streptococcus  sanguis of a gene for staphylokinase--a bacterial plasminogen activator.
AB  == the gene coding for the bacterial plasminogen activator staphylokinase was cloned from the staphylococcus aureus phage 42d, a serogroup f phage used for lysotyping, onto the standard escherichia coli plasmid vector pacyc184. the coding and flanking sequences of the sak42d gene were largely identical to those  of a sak gene cloned from the serologically different s. aureus phage soc (sako and tsuchida 1983). subcloning of a 2.5 kb phage 42d dna fragment onto plasmid pgb3631 allowed the sak42d gene to be introduced into the gram-positive hosts bacillus subtilis and streptococcus sanguis. the sak42d gene was expressed and secreted most efficiently by b. subtilis cells (25 micrograms/ml of culture supernatant) reduced in exoprotease production. in this host expression and secretion of sak was initiated at the early growth phase and continued through the logarithmic phase. formation of sak was, however, also observed with the other cloning hosts. the sak elaborated by the heterologous hosts was serologically identical with authentic sak derived from s. aureus.

TI  == transposable multiple antibiotic resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == a mobile genetic element, designated tn1545, was detected in the chromosome of streptococcus pneumoniae bm4200, a clinical isolate multiply resistant to antibiotics. the 25.3 kb element conferred resistance to kanamycin and structurally related aminoglycosides by synthesis of a 3'-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase type iii (apha-3), to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b-type antibiotics (ermam), and to tetracycline (tetm). tn1545 was self-transferable to a recombination deficient s. faecalis strain where it was able to transpose to various sites, induce insertional mutations and was apparently cleanly excised. the element also conjugated to and transposed to the  chromosome of s. faecalis, s. lactis, s. diacetylactis, s. cremoris, s. sanguis,  staphylococcus aureus, and listeria monocytogenes. the properties of the conjugative transposon tn1545 could account for the sudden emergence, rapid dissemination, and stabilisation of multiple resistance to antibiotics in s. pneumoniae in the absence of plasmids.

TI  == construction of plasmid vectors for the detection of streptococcal promoters.
AB  == plasmid vectors have been constructed for detecting dna fragments that exhibit promoter activity in streptococcus sanguis. the plasmids are able to replicate in both s. sanguis and escherichia coli, and contain an erythromycin resistance marker which is expressed in both hosts. selection for promoter activity is dependent upon the insertion of appropriate dna fragments upstream from a promoterless chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene (cat) from staphylococcus aureus. to facilitate this insertion, a pair of vectors, pmu1327 and pmu1328, were constructed with the polylinker from m13mp 18 in either orientation. the to  transcriptional terminator of phage lambda is present downstream from cat. translation stop codons in all reading frames are located between the polylinker  and the initiation codon of cat. these plasmids have been used to isolate dna fragments from s. sanguis, s. lactis and s. cremoris that exhibit promoter activity in s. sanguis.

TI  == microbial adhesion to fibronectin in vitro correlates with production of endocarditis in rabbits.
AB  == microbial adhesion to the constituents of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (nbte) is an important early event in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis. fibronectin is a ubiquitous mammalian glycoprotein with diverse functions which binds to certain bacteria but not to others. in this study, we determined that fibronectin is present on the surface of nbte (after catheter-induced aortic valve trauma) but not on normal rabbit cardiac valvular endothelium. the adhesion of various bacteria and yeasts to human fibronectin in tissue culture wells was then measured. microorganisms with a high isolation frequency from endocarditis cases (staphylococcus aureus, candida tropicalis, c. albicans, streptococcus faecalis, s. sanguis) bound significantly better (p less than 0.01) to fibronectin in vitro than other organisms (escherichia coli, c. krusei, pseudomonas aeruginosa) rarely implicated in this disease. microbial adhesion to  fibronectin correlated closely with the propensity of each organism to produce endocarditis in rabbits (e.g., id50) with preexistent nbte. a similar distribution was noted after binding of soluble radiolabeled fibronectin to bacteria in suspension. the results suggest that fibronectin, expressed on the surface of nbte, may mediate microbial adhesion of circulating organisms to initiate colonization during the early pathogenesis of infective endocarditis.

TI  == extracellular matrix proteins (fibronectin, laminin, and type iv collagen) bind and aggregate bacteria.
AB  == the normal microbial colonization of sites in the body's tissues by certain bacteria requires that the bacteria first bind to extracellular secreted constituents, cell-surface membranes, or cell matrixes. this study examines two interactions of a variety of bacteria with the cell matrix noncollagenous proteins fibronectin and laminin and with basement membrane (type iv) collagen. adherence of bacteria to matrix proteins coated on tissue culture wells was examined with the use of radiolabeled bacteria. staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus sanguis bound well to fibronectin, laminin, and type iv collagen, whereas a variety of gram-negative organisms did not bind. the interaction of soluble laminin, fibronectin, and type iv collagen with bacteria was monitored by nephelometry with the use of a platelet aggregometer. s. aureus aggregated in response to fibronectin, laminin, or type iv collagen. in contrast, gram-negative organisms did not aggregate with these proteins. it appears that fibronectin, laminin, and type iv collagen can bind and aggregate certain gram-positive bacteria, and this binding is dependent on the surface characteristics of the organism. these adhesion molecules may play a role in the normal colonization of sites by microorganisms and in invasion during infections.

AB  == staphylococci pretreated with subminimal inhibitory concentrations (submic) of cell-wall active antibiotics exhibit increased susceptibility to killing by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns), even when phagosome information is impaired  by the mold metabolite, cytochalasin b. to investigate the role of specific bacterial factors in the process, studies were carried out with organisms lacking catalase (streptococci) or cell-wall autolytic enzymes and compared to findings with staphylococcus aureus 502a. neutrophil factors were studied using inhibitors, oxygen radical scavengers, myeloperoxidase (mpo)-deficient pmns, or pmns from a patient with chronic granulomatous disease (cgd). documentation of the enhanced susceptibility of the streptococcal strains to killing by pmns following submic penicillin pretreatment required the use of cytochalasin b. enhancement of killing occurred independent of the presence or absence of bacterial autolysins or catalase. submic penicillin pretreatment of s. pneumoniae r36a specifically promoted the susceptibility of these organisms to killing by myeloperoxidase (mpo)-mediated mechanisms (enhancement lost using mpo-deficient or azide-treated cells). factors other than mpo or toxic oxygen products generated by the pmn respiratory burst are responsible for enhanced killing of penicillin-pretreated s. aureus 502a (enhancement preserved using mpo-deficient,  azide-treated, or chronic granulomatous disease patient cells). these studies define methods to study the interaction of antimicrobial agents and pmns in the killing of microorganisms. they also demonstrate that penicillin treatment can change the susceptibility of gram-positive cocci to the action of specific pmn microbicidal mechanisms. the mechanism of the enhancement appears to be bacterial strain-dependent and not predictable by bacterial autolysin or catalase activity.

[gene 20 (1982) 51-62], has been determined. the nmt amino acid (aa) sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence contains extensive homology to aa sequences of cognate nmts specified by: (1) plasmid pe194 from staphylococcus  aureus, 30% g + c, ermc; (2) plasmid pam77 from streptococcus sanguis, 43% g + c; as well as to (3) a chromosomal determinant from bacillus licheniformis 759, 46%  g + c, ermd, cloned in a recombinant plasmid pbd90. these findings suggest that all four nmt structural genes could have evolved from a common progenitor sequence despite the wide range of % g + c of the erm genes reflecting their current respective hosts. comparison of the four nmt sequences with respect to localized hydrophobicity averaged over a moving window of 11 aa indicates that the common features of localized hydrophobicity that characterize the c-terminal  portion of the erme and ermd proteins are distinguishable from a contrasting pattern of hydrophobicity that characterizes the ermc and pam77-coded proteins.

TI  == isolation of a novel protein involved in the transport of fructose by an inducible phosphoenolpyruvate fructose phosphotransferase system in streptococcus mutans.
AB  == fructose transport in streptococcus mutans lg-1 is mediated by at least two distinct phosphoenolpyruvate fructose phosphotransferase systems. one system is constitutive and consists of membrane components enzyme ii as well as enzyme i and heat-stable protein. the other system is inducible and requires, in addition  to enzyme i and heat-stable protein, a soluble substrate-specific protein for catalytic activity. this protein factor, designated iiifru, was purified by deae-cellulose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, molecular sieving  on sephadex g-75, and preparative electrophoresis. the purified preparation showed only one protein band, with a molecular weight of 12,600, on sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, on gel electrophoresis with the discontinuous buffer tris-glycine, and after electrofocusing in gel (pi  congruent to 3.7). the molecular weight of the native protein determined by gel filtration at 4 degrees c was 51,000. immunodiffusion experiments performed with  immunoglobulins prepared against the purified iiifru from s. mutans lg-1 suggested that other s. mutans strains possessed a iiifru. no precipitin bands, however, were detected with extracts from s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. lactis, s. faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, lactobacillus casei, and escherichia coli.

TI  == lactose transport in streptococcus mutans: isolation and characterization of factor iiilac, a specific protein component of the phosphoenolpyruvate-lactose phosphotransferase system.
AB  == the transport of lactose in streptococcus mutans is mediated via an inducible phosphoenolpyruvate-lactose phosphotransferase system. this system requires for catalytic activity a membrane fraction (enzyme ii), two general proteins called enzyme i and hpr, and a soluble specific protein termed factor iiilac. this protein factor was purified from s. mutans atcc 27352 by chromatographies on deae-cellulose, hydroxylapatite, ultrogel aca 34, and phosphocellulose. the purified protein migrated as a single band with a molecular weight of 10,000 on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and  urea. the molecular weight calculated from the amino acid composition was 10,541. gel filtration of the native protein gave a molecular weight of 41,500. its isoelectric point was ca. 4.70. a specific antiserum was prepared against purified factor iiilac. immunodiffusion experiments revealed that only cellular extracts from lactose-grown cells contained factor iiilac. a cross-reaction was observed with all of the s. mutans strains tested as well as with streptococcus sanguis 10556, streptococcus lactis 11454, and staphylococcus aureus 6538. no precipitin band was observed with extracts of streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, and bacillus subtilis.

TI  == group a streptococcal peptidoglycan-polysaccharide inhibits phagocytic activity of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  == injection of sterile aqueous preparations of the peptidoglycan-polysaccharide of  group a streptococci (pg-aps) produces chronic inflammation in several animal models. chronic bacterial infection may be involved in some aspects of the pathogenesis of inflammation associated with the accumulation of pg-aps. accordingly, the effect of pg-aps on human neutrophil (polymorphonuclear leukocyte [pmn]) bactericidal activity was studied with the supposition that this interaction may contribute to the inflammation observed. concentrations of pg-aps greater than 10 micrograms/ml inhibited the ability of pmns to kill staphylococcus aureus. this inhibition was not due to a cytotoxic effect of pg-aps on pmns, nor did pg-aps inhibit pmn metabolism required for the formation  of microbicidal oxygen reduction products. pg-aps concentrations of 10 micrograms/ml or greater in the presence of 10% normal serum inhibited the attachment of bacteria to pmns by 49% as compared with control cell populations.  the concentrations of pg-aps required to inhibit uptake of staphylococcus aureus  were identical to those required for inhibition of pmn bactericidal activity. this inhibition did not occur in the presence of serum-free medium or medium with sera that had been heated to inactivate complement. these results show that pg-aps interacts with serum to inhibit pmn-mediated killing of s. aureus, most probably by interfering with bacterial uptake.

TI  == ability of various oral bacteria to bind human plasma fibronectin.
AB  == the present study describes the ability of various oral bacteria to bind human plasma fibronectin (pfn). avid binding of 125i-pfn was found for streptococcus mutans (serotypes a to h), streptococcus sanguis, group a streptococcus pyogenes  and staphylococcus aureus, while other gram-positive bacterial species tested demonstrated only weak or negligible pfn binding ability. two gram-negative bacterial species, bacteroides gingivalis and escherichia coli, did not significantly bind pfn. 125i-pfn binding to s. mutans 6715 cells was decreased by pretreatment with unlabeled pfn, and the radiolabeled pfn bound to the cell surface was released on addition of unlabeled pfn. strong inhibition of 125i-pfn  binding to s. mutans 6715 cells was obtained by protease pretreatment, while partial inhibition was also observed following treatment with acid, alkali, lipase, and monoclonal anti-polyglycerophosphate. these results suggest that pfn  binding to s. mutans cells is reversible and that pfn receptors on the cell surface appear to be heat-stable multiple proteins.

TI  == adp-like platelet aggregation activity generated by viridans streptococci incubated with exogenous atp.
AB  == to explore the possibility that streptococcus sanguis aggregation of platelet-rich plasma (prp) might be mediated by soluble agents, we tested cell-free s. sanguis supernatant for aggregation activity. the supernatant of untreated s. sanguis was without measurable prp aggregation activity. in contrast, the cell-free supernatant of atp-incubated s. sanguis produced an immediate wave of prp aggregation. the supernatant with prp aggregating activity  contained insufficient protease to produce a response. the response increased with the time of incubation with atp. active supernatant was desalted and chromatographed on nucleotide-calibrated columns of dowex 1-x8. an active adp function was identified. the activity was insensitive to dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, but was sensitive to both ca2+ and ca2+-mg2+ chelating  agents, cold (4 degrees c), heat (80 degrees c), ph (optimum between ph 7 and 8), apyrase, and sodium molybdate. in addition, preincubation of prp with adenosine inhibited activity. strains of viridans streptococci were screened for activity.  aggregation-promoting strains showed two times more activity than did other strains. although it was not vigorously excluded that the adp was discharged from the microbes, the existence of an exogenous atpase on s. sanguis was strongly suggested. the expression of the activity was associated with the lag time to onset of prp aggregation with intact s. sanguis. this activity could, therefore,  be a synergistic promoter of prp aggregation and an additional virulence factor in endocarditis.

TI  == aggregation of human platelets and adhesion of streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == platelet vegetations or thrombi are common findings in subacute bacterial endocarditis. we investigated the hypothesis that human platelets selectively bind or adhere strains of streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans and aggregate, as a result, into an in vitro thrombus. earlier ultrastructural studies suggested that aggregation of platelets over time by staphylococcus aureus was preceded in order by adhesion and platelet activation. we uncoupled the adhesion step from activation and aggregation in our studies by incubating streptococci with platelet ghosts in a simple, quantitative assay. adhesion was shown to be mediated by protease-sensitive components on the streptococci and platelet ghosts rather than cell surface carbohydrates or dextrans, plasma components, or divalent cations. the same streptococci were also studied by standard aggregometry techniques. platelet-rich plasma was activated and aggregated by certain isolates of s. sanguis. platelet ghosts bound the same strains selectively under ca2+- and plasma-depleted conditions. fresh platelets could activate after washing, but ca2+ had to be restored. aggregation required fresh platelets in ca2+-restored plasma and was inducible by washed streptococcal cell walls. these reactions in the binding and aggregometry assays were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. surface microfibrils on intact s. sanguis were identified. these appendages appeared to bind s. sanguis to platelets. the selectivity of adhesion of the various s. sanguis strains to platelet ghosts or ca2+- and plasma-depleted fresh washed platelets was similar for all donors. thus, the platelet binding site was expressed widely in the population and was unlikely to be an artifact of membrane aging or preparation. since selective adhesion of s. sanguis to platelets was apparently required for aggregation, it is suggested that functionally defined receptors for ligands on certain strains of s. sanguis may be present on human platelets. some differences in the selectivity and rate of the aggregation response were noted among platelet donors, although the meaning of the variability requires further study. nonetheless, these interactions may contribute to platelet accretion in the initiation and development of vegetative lesions in the subacute bacterial endocarditis.

TI  == production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
AB  == staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. these strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of staphylococcus aureus fda209p. the frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. strain iys2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. iys2 was identified to be s. aureus, based on its biological properties. the bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. the isoelectric point was 10.0. in amino acid  composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. the bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. the bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. an analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that streptococcus salivarius, propionibacterium acnes, corynebacterium parvulum, and actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacterionema matruchotii, and bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. the majority of s. aureus tested were susceptible, and all staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.

TI  == effect of human saliva on glucose uptake by streptococcus mutans and other oral microorganisms.
AB  == we examined the effects of human whole salivary supernatant and parotid fluid on  glucose uptake by streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. the following three effects of saliva were observed: (i) inhibition of glucose uptake (s. mutans, s. sanguis), (ii) promotion of a transient, rapid (0 to 30 s) burst of glucose uptake (s. mutans, s. sanguis), and (iii) enhancement of glucose uptake (s. mitis, a. viscosus, s. aureus, e. coli). we observed no differences between the effects of whole salivary supernatant and the effects of parotid fluid. heat treatment (80 degrees c, 10 min) of saliva or the addition of dithiothreitol abolished inhibition of glucose uptake. supplementation of saliva  with h(2)o(2) potentiated inhibition of glucose uptake. s. mitis and a. viscosus, which were stimulated by saliva alone, were inhibited by h(2)o(2)-supplemented saliva; 50% inhibition of glucose uptake by s. mutans and s. mitis required ca. 10 mum h(2)o(2) in 50% (vol/vol) saliva. loss of the inhibitory action of saliva  occurred at about 5% (vol/vol) saliva. supplementation of saliva dilutions with scn(-) and h(2)o(2) extended the inhibitory activity to solutions containing ca.  0.2% (vol/vol) saliva. we suggest that the salivary lactoperoxidase-scn(-)-h(2)o(2) system is responsible for the inhibitory activity of saliva reported here. furthermore, we concluded that lactoperoxidase and scn(-) are present in saliva specimens in concentrations that exceed minimal inhibitory levels by factors of ca. 500 and 10 to 20, respectively. the resistance of a. viscosus, s. aureus, and e. coli to the inhibitory potential of  saliva alone was probably due to the production of catalase by these organisms. the resistance of s. mitis may have been due to special effects of saliva on h(2)o(2) accumulation by this organism compared with s. mutans and s. sanguis. the basis of saliva-dependent enhancement of glucose uptake and the basis of promotion of a transient, rapid burst of glucose uptake are unknown. the role of  the salivary lactoperoxidase-scn(-)-h(2)o(2) system in the oral microbial ecosystem is discussed.

TI  == location of antibiotic resistance determinants, copy control, and replication functions on the double-selective streptococcal cloning vector pgb301.
AB  == the physical map of the streptococcal cloning vector pgb301 (9.8 kb) has been extended by localizing the cleavage sites of restriction endonucleases avaii, avai, bcli, bsteii, and pvuii. the latter four enzymes cleaved pgb301 at unique sites. insertion of chromosomal dna from staphylococcus aureus strain 3ar-m- into the single bsteii site of pgb301 led to inactivation of the plasmid's chloramphenicol resistance determinant. twelve deletion derivatives of pgb301 were isolated either by in vitro manipulation of pgb301 or as spontaneous deletion mutants following transformation of challis by mixtures of recombinant plasmids. the overlapping deletions which spanned a continuous sequence of 7.7 kb ranged in size from 0.3 kb to 4.1 kb and allowed to localize the chloramphenicol  and mls-resistance determinants, the copy control function, and the replication region on the physical map of pgb301. plasmid pgb301 together with its deletion mutants constitutes a valuable tool for further molecular cloning experiments in  streptococci.
