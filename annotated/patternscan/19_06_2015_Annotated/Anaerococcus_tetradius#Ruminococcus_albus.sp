TI  == antimicrobial activity of brazilian propolis extracts against rumen bacteria in vitro.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of three brazilian propolis extracts was evaluated on  bacterial strains representing major rumen functional groups. the extracts were prepared using different concentrations of propolis and alcohol, resulting in different phenolic compositions. the propolis extracts inhibited the growth of fibrobacter succinogenes s85, ruminococcus flavefaciens fd-1, ruminococcus albus  7, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens d1, prevotella albensis m384, peptostreptococcus sp. d1, clostridium aminophilum f and streptococcus bovis pearl11, while r. albus 20, prevotella bryantii b(1)4 and ruminobacter amylophilus h18 were resistant to all  the extracts. the inhibited strains showed also different sensitivity to propolis; the hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria (c. aminophilum f and peptostreptococcus sp. d1) being the most sensitive. inhibition of hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria by propolis would be beneficial to the animal. the extract containing the lowest amount of phenolic compounds (llos c3) showed the lowest antimicrobial activity against all the bacteria. the major phenolic compounds identified in the propolis extracts (naringenin, chrysin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid and artepillin c) were also evaluated on four sensitive strains.  only naringenin showed inhibitory effect against all strains, suggesting that naringenin is one of the components participating to the antibacterial activity of propolis.

TI  == variation in antimicrobial action of proanthocyanidins from dorycnium rectum against rumen bacteria.
AB  == the proanthocyanidin polymer fractions of the leaves of the forage legume dorycnium rectum were analysed by acid catalysis with benzyl mercaptan, nmr and es-ms. the results showed that d. rectum differs from other temperate proanthocyanidin-containing forage legumes in that the range of polymers extends  up to very high degrees of polymerisation. three fractions were characterised as  low, medium, and high molecular weight proanthocyanidin fractions with mean degree of polymerisations of 10.3, 41 and 127, respectively. epigallocatechin was the most abundant extension unit and the terminating flavan-3-ols comprised largely catechin and gallocatechin units in equal proportions. formation of thiolyated dimer products showed the interflavan-linkages of the lower molecular  weight proanthocyanidins to be predominantly c4-->c8 with a small amount of c4-->c6. es-ms spectra distinguished lower from higher polymeric proanthocyanidins from m2- to m8(2)-. the antibacterial activity of proanthocyanidin fractions against pure cultures of microbes selected from the ruminal population to represent fibre degrading, proteolytic and hyper ammonia producing bacteria in broth culture was evaluated. the activity of proanthocyanidin fractions against clostridium aminophilum, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and clostridium proteoclasticum was significantly dependent on their structure but not so against ruminococcus albus and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. the latter observation was unique in that they were sensitive to all  proanthocyanidin fractions evaluated, even at the lowest concentration (100 microg/ml). the results suggest the effects of the extractable proanthocyanidins  on rumen microbes should be considered when evaluating an alternative proanthocyanidin-containing forage source for ruminants, such as d. rectum.

TI  == development of a membrane-array method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == a membrane-array method was developed for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples without using the expensive microarray-arrayer and laser-scanner. the 16s rdna sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to nitrocellulose membranes. digoxigenin (dig)-labeled 16s rdnas were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from human fecal samples or pure cultured bacteria using two universal primers, and were hybridized to the membrane-array. hybridization signals were read by nbt/bcip color development. the 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, b. fragilis, b. distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, c. leptum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, ruminococcus obeum, r. bromii, r. callidus, r. albus, bifidobacterium  longum, b. adolescentis, b. infantis, eubacterium biforme, e. aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus,escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecium. the two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16s rdna from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. the hybridization results indicated that the membrane-array method is a reliable technique for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples. the result was also confirmed by  using specific pcr methods for these bacteria.

TI  == design and evaluation of oligonucleotide-microarray method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == an oligonucleotide-microarray method was developed for the detection of intestinal bacteria in fecal samples collected from human subjects. the 16s rdna  sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to glass slides. cyanine5 (cy5)-labeled 16s rdnas were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from human fecal samples or bacterial dna using two universal primers and were hybridized to the oligo-microarray. the 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, clostridium leptum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, ruminococcus obeum, ruminococcus bromii, ruminococcus callidus, ruminococcus albus, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium infantis, eubacterium biforme, eubacterium aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus, escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecium. the two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16s rdna from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. the hybridization results indicated that the oligo-microarray method developed in this study is a reliable method for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples.

TI  == rapid diagnosis of anaerobic gram-positive cocci by salt tolerance.
AB  == the maximum salt tolerance was 2.5% in cases of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptococcus prevotii, 3% in ruminococcus albus, 4% in acidaminococcus fermentans, peptococcus niger and megasphaera elsdenii and 5% in peptococcus magnus. the biochemical tests being largely inactive and time consuming the findings of salt  tolerance if combined with those of morphological data provide clue to the rapid  identification of gram-positive anaerobic cocci.

TI  == urease assay and urease-producing species of anaerobes in the bovine rumen and human feces.
AB  == a growth medium and test were developed for rapid detection of urease in fermentative anaerobic bacteria. using nonselective rumen fluid roll-tube agar medium and the new test, it was confirmed that peptostreptococcus productus is often the most numerous urease-forming species in human feces. also, some fecal strains of ruminococcus albus, clostridium innocuum, and clostridium beijerinckii produced urease. single strains of fusobacterium prausnitzii, coprococcus catus,  and streptococcus mitis that were strongly ureolytic on isolation later lost this ability. urease activity was also detected in many strains of nonselectively isolated rumen species. they include succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, treponema sp., ruminococcus bromii (not previously known to be present in the rumen), butyrivibrio sp., bifidobacterium sp., bacteroides ruminicola, and p. productus.  most p. productus strains contain urease; however, the uniformity of this feature in the other species noted above is not known. the urease in many of these species was not detected if the growth medium contained 0.2% or more (each) yeast extract and trypticase.

TI  == tryptophan biosynthesis from indole-3-acetic acid by anaerobic bacteria from the  rumen.
AB  == microbes in ruminal contents incorporated (14)c into cells when they were incubated in vitro in the presence of [(14)c]carboxyl-labeled indole-3-acetic acid (iaa). most of the cellular (14)c was found to be in tryptophan from the protein fractions of the cells. pure cultures of several important ruminal species did not incorporate labeled iaa, but all four strains of ruminococcus albus tested utilized iaa for tryptophan synthesis. r. albus did not incorporate  (14)c into tryptophan during growth in medium containing either labeled serine or labeled shikimic acid. the mechanism of tryptophan biosynthesis from iaa is not known but appears to be different from any described biosynthetic pathway. we propose that a reductive carboxylation, perhaps involving a low-potential electron donor such as ferredoxin, is involved.

TI  == fermentation of isolated pectin and pectin from intact forages by pure cultures of rumen bacteria.
AB  == studies on the rate and extent of galacturonic acid and isolated pectin digestion were carried out with nine strains of rumen bacteria (butyrivibrio fibrisolvens h10b and d16f, bacteroides ruminicola 23 and d31d, lachnospira multiparus d15d, peptostreptococcus sp. d43e, b. succinogenes a3c, ruminococcus flavefaciens b34b, and r. albus 7). only three strains, 23, d16f, and d31d, utilized galacturonic acid as a sole energy source, whereas all strains except a3c and h10b degraded (solubilized) and utilized purified pectin. nutrient composition of the basal medium and separate sterilization of the substrate affected the rate and extent of fermentation for both substrates. pectin degradation and utilization were measured with two maturity stages each of intact bromegrass and alfalfa. for bromegrass i, all strains tested (b34b, 23, d16f, d31d, d15d, and d43e) degraded  a considerable amount of pectin and, with the exception of b34b, utilized most of what was degraded. similar, but lower, results were obtained with bromegrass ii,  except for the two strains of b. ruminicola, 23 and d31d, which were unable to degrade and utilize pectin from this forage. all strains were able to degrade and utilize pectin from both maturity stages of alfalfa; however, values were considerably lower for strains 23 and d31d. synergism studies, in which a limited utilizing strain, b34b, was combined with the limited degrading strain, d31d, resulted in a slight increase in degradation and a very marked increase in utilization of the pectin in all four forages. similar results were obtained on both alfalfa substrates with a combination of strains b34b and d16f; however, no  increases were observed with this combination on bromegrass.

TI  == carbon dioxide requirement of various species of rumen bacteria.
AB  == the carbon dioxide requirement of 32 strains of rumen bacteria, representing 11 different species, was studied in detail. increasing concentrations of co(2) were added as nahco(3) to a specially prepared co(2)-free medium which was tubed and inoculated under nitrogen. prior depletion of co(2) in the inoculum was found to  affect the level of requirement; however, the complexity and buffering capacity of the medium did not appear to be involved. an absolute requirement for co(2) was observed for eight strains of bacteroides ruminicola, three strains of bacteroides succinogenes, four strains of ruminococcus flavefaciens, two strains  of lachnospira multiparus, one strain of succinimonas amylolytica, and two strains of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens. inconsistent growth responses were obtained in co(2)-free media with one strain each of b. fibrisolvens, ruminococcus albus,  and selenomonas ruminantium. growth of six additional strains of b. fibrisolvens, and single strains of eubacterium ruminantium and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens was markedly increased or stimulated by increasing concentrations of co(2). peptostreptococcus elsdenii b159 was the only organism tested which appeared to have no requirement, either absolute or partial, for co(2). higher concentrations of co(2) were required for the initiation of growth, as well as for optimal growth, by those species which produce succinic acid as one of their primary end  products.

TI  == enzymatic studies of pure cultures of rumen microorganisms.
AB  == joyner, a. e., jr. (university of california, davis), and r. l. baldwin. enzymatic studies of pure cultures of rumen microorganisms. j. bacteriol. 92:1321-1330. 1966.-the activities of enzymes representing the major pathways of  carbohydrate metabolism and anaerobic electron transport in cell-free extracts of whole rumen contents have been reported. the effects of diet upon the activities  of several enzymes suggested that enzymatic measurements might prove useful for the study of rumen metabolism. in the present study, the distribution and characteristics of aldolase, succinate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase, lactyl-coenzyme a dehydrase, lactate dehydrogenase, and other enzymes were measured in cell-free extracts of pure cultures of ruminococcus flavefaciens, r.  albus, bacteroides succinogenes, b. ruminicola, b. amylophilus, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, peptostreptococcus elsdenii, streptococcus bovis, and selenomonas ruminantium. some enzymes were widely distributed (aldolase, glutamate dehydrogenase), whereas others were observed in one or two species (lactyl-coenzyme a dehydrase). the cofactor requirements and kinetic characteristics of enzymes varied considerably with species. enzymes that vary with species might be employed as indices for estimating the activities of various groups of microorganisms in whole rumen contents.
