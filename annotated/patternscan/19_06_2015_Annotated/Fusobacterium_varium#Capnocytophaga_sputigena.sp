TI  == association of early onset periodontitis microbiota with aspartate aminotransferase activity in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == objectives: the objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the activity of the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (ast) in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) using the colorimetric periogard (ptm) test and the subgingival microflora in early onset periodontitis lesions. material and methods: the study population consisted of 25 otherwise healthy individuals exhibiting early onset periodontitis (eop). in each patient four experimental sites were identified comprising one deep periodontal pocket (pd >5 mm) randomly  chosen in each quadrant. bacterial samples were obtained from the experimental sites, consecutively cultured anaerobically and in 10% co(2) using selective and  nonselective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional  biochemical tests and various identification kits. clinical measurements as well  as ast activity, assessed either as positive or negative using the ptm, were recorded at the same sites. results: sixty-two sites exhibited ast positive and 38 ast negative activity. analysis of bacterial counts using the anova (mann whitney u-test) showed that streptococcus intermedius, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides forsythus, camplobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus and selenomonas sputigena were significantly higher in sites with ast-positive activity. the odds ratio of having high prevalence of s. intermedius, p. micros, c. concisus, b. forsythus, c. gracilis, c. rectus and s.  sputigena in the presence of a positive ast site was very high (range: 3.5-17.0). streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, gemella morbillorum, capnocytophaga gingivalis, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium varium, eubacterium lentum and prevotella oralis were detected in significantly higher proportions in sites with ast negative activity and manifested a negative odds ratio in the presence of ast positive sites. the logistic regression analysis revealed that smoking and bleeding upon probing showed a significant association with ast activity, while plaque and suppuration were not found to be significant predictors of ast activity. the co-infection of porphyromonas gingivalis, b. forsythus and p. micros, or p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and c. rectus were found  to be significantly associated with the ast activity (p<0.001). ast positive sites revealed significantly higher occurrence of co-infections by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. sputigena or by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. intermedius than ast negative sites (p<0.001). p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, a. naeslundii co-infection was found significantly higher in the ast negative sites (p<0.001).  conclusions: the present study found a high level of agreement between the presence of putative periodontal pathogens and positive ast scores at periodontal sites that clinically were considered to be potentially disease active. prospective studies should be performed to confirm the findings.

TI  == subgingival microflora associated with nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to examine the composition of subgingival plaque of 140 periodontal lesions in 35 patients with cardiovascular disorders who were administered nifedipine and manifested nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth (go). age was inversely associated with the go. plaque index and bleeding index showed a significant association with go, while nifedipine dosage and duration of nifedipine therapy were not found to be significant predictors of go. the gingival inflammation as expressed in the logistic regression model by the interaction term color x tone was found to be significantly associated with the go. statistically significant differences between the groups of comparable probing depth and different degrees of go were detected for propionibacterium acnes, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, bacteroides gracilis, fusobacterium mortiferum, fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium varium and selenomonas sputigena in deep and enlarged lesions. significantly more frequently isolated were the bacterial species eubacterium alactolyticum, campylobacter concisus, c. gingivalis, c. ochracea, c. sputigena, f. mortiferum, f. nucleatum, and f. varium from the more enlarged lesions (go >3).
