TI  - Detection of pathogenic clostridia in biogas plant wastes.
AB  - As the number of biogas plants has grown rapidly in the last decade, the amount of potentially contaminated wastes with pathogenic Clostridium spp. has increased as well. This study reports the results from examining 203 biogas plant wastes (BGWs). The following Clostridium spp. with different frequencies could be isolated via a new enrichment medium (Krune medium) and detected by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS): Clostridium perfringens (58 %) then Clostridium bifermentans (27 %), Clostridium tertium (23 %) and Clostridium butyricum (19 %), Clostridium cadaveris (15 %), Clostridium parapurificum (6 %), Clostridium glycolicum (5 %), Clostridium baratii (4 %), Clostridium sporogenes (2 %), Clostridium sordellii (1 %) and Clostridium subterminale (0.5 %). The mean most probable number (MPN) count of sulfite reducing bacteria was between 10(3) and 10(4)/mL, and the higher the MPN, the more pathogenic Clostridium spp. were present. Also, real-time PCR was used to be compared with culture method for C. perfringens, C. bifermentans, C. butyricum, C. sporogenes/Clostridium botulinum and C. sordellii. Although real-time PCR was more sensitive than the culture method, both systems improve the recovery rate but in different ways and are useful to determine pathogenic clostridia in biogas plants. In conclusion, BGWs could present a biohazard risk of clostridia for humans and animals.
TI  - Antibacterial activity against Clostridium genus and antiradical activity of the  essential oils from different origin.
AB  - In the present study, the antimicrobial and antiradical activities of 15 essential oils were investigated. The antimicrobial activities were determined by using agar disc diffusion and broth microdilution methods against Clostridium genus and antioxidant properties of essential oils by testing their scavenging effect on DPPH radicals activities. We determined the antibacterial activity of Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium hystoliticum, Clostridium intestinale, Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium ramosum. We obtained the original commercial essential oils samples of Lavandula angustifolia, Carum carvi, Pinus montana, Mentha piperita, Foeniculum vulgare Mill., Pinus sylvestris, Satureia montana, Origanum vulgare L. (2 samples), Pimpinella anisum, Rosmarinus officinalis L., Salvia officinalis L., Abies alba Mill., Chamomilla recutita L. Rausch and Thymus vulgaris L. produced in Slovakia (Calendula a.s., Nova Lubovna, Slovakia). The results of the disk diffusion method showed very high essential oils activity against all tested strains of microorganisms. The best antimicrobial activity against C. butyricum was found at Pimpinella anisum, against C. hystoliticum was found at Pinus sylvestris, against C. intestinale was found at Satureia hortensis L., against C. perfringens was found at Origanum vulgare L. and against C. ramosum was found at Pinus sylvestris. The results of broth microdilution assay showed that none of the essential oils was active against C. hystoliticum. The best antimicrobial activity against C. butyricum was found at Abies alba Mill., against C. intestinale was found at Abies alba Mill., against C. perfringens was found at Satureia montana and against C. ramosum was found at Abius alba and Carum carvi. Antioxidant DPPH radical scavenging activity was determined at several solutions of oil samples (50 muL.mL(-1)-0.39 muL.mL(-1)) and the best scavenging effect for the highest concentration (50 muL.mL(-1)) was observed. The antioxidant properties were different in particular plant species. The highest% of inhibition after 30 min. of reaction was observed at Origanum vulgare (93%), Satureia montana (90.66%) and Lavandula augustifolia (90.22%).
TI  - Effects of Clostridium butyricum on growth performance, immune function, and cecal microflora in broiler chickens challenged with Escherichia coli K88.
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the effects of Clostridium butyricumon growth performance, immune function, and cecal microflora in broiler chickens challenged with Escherichia coli K88. Three hundred sixty 1-d-old broiler chickens were randomly divided into 4 treatments: negative control (NC) birds were fed a basal diet and not challenged with E. coli K88; positive control (PC) birds were fed a basal diet and challenged with E. coli K88; C. butyricum treatment (CB) birds were fed a diet containing 2 x 10(7) cfu C. butyricum/kg of diet and challenged with E. coli K88; and colistin sulfate treatment (CS) birds were fed a diet containing 20 mg of colistin sulfate/kg of diet and challenged with E. coli K88. Birds fed CB had greater (P < 0.05) BW than the PC birds from 3 to 21 d postchallenge. Birds fed CB had greater (P < 0.05) serum IgA and IgY at 14 d postchallenge, greater (P < 0.05) serum IgM at 21 d postchallenge, and greater (P < 0.05) mucosal secreted IgA at 3 and 7 d postchallenge than the PC birds. Birds fed CB had greater concentrations of serum complement component 3 at 14 d postchallenge, and greater (P < 0.05) concentrations of serum complement component 4 at 3, 7, and 14 d postchallenge than the PC birds. Birds in the CS or CB treatments had less cecal E. coli population at 3, 7, and 21 d postchallenge, and less cecal Clostridium perfringens counts at 21 d postchallenge compared with the PC birds. The CB treatment increased (P < 0.05) the population of cecal Lactobacillus at 3 d postchallenge and the number of cecal Bifidobacterium at 3, 14, and 21 d postchallenge in comparison with the PC treatment. The results indicate that dietary supplementation of CB promotes growth performance, improves immune function, and benefits the cecal microflora in Escherichia coli K88-challenged chickens.
TI  - A gene-targeted approach to investigate the intestinal butyrate-producing bacterial community.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Butyrate, which is produced by the human microbiome, is essential for a well-functioning colon. Bacteria that produce butyrate are phylogenetically diverse, which hinders their accurate detection based on conventional phylogenetic markers. As a result, reliable information on this important bacterial group is often lacking in microbiome research. RESULTS: In this study we describe a gene-targeted approach for 454 pyrotag sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction for the final genes in the two primary bacterial butyrate synthesis pathways, butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase (but) and butyrate kinase (buk). We monitored the establishment and early succession of butyrate-producing communities in four patients with ulcerative colitis who underwent a colectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis and compared it with three control samples from healthy colons. All patients established an abundant butyrate-producing community (approximately 5% to 26% of the total community) in the pouch within the 2-month study, but patterns were distinctive among individuals. Only one patient harbored a community profile similar to the healthy controls, in which there was a predominance of but genes that are similar to reference genes from Acidaminococcus sp., Eubacterium sp., Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Roseburia sp., and an almost complete absence of buk genes. Two patients were greatly enriched in buk genes similar to those of Clostridium butyricum and C. perfringens, whereas a fourth patient displayed abundant communities containing both genes. Most butyrate producers identified in previous studies were detected and the general patterns of taxa found were supported by 16S rRNA gene pyrotag analysis, but the gene-targeted approach provided more detail about the potential butyrate-producing members of the community. CONCLUSIONS: The presented approach provides quantitative and genotypic insights into butyrate-producing communities and facilitates a more specific functional characterization of the intestinal microbiome. Furthermore, our analysis refines but and buk reference annotations found in central databases.
TI  - Batch fermentative hydrogen production by enriched mixed culture: Combination strategy and their microbial composition.
AB  - The effect of individual and combined mixed culture on dark fermentative hydrogen production performance was investigated. Mixed cultures from cow dung (C1), sewage sludge (C2), and pig slurry (C3) were enriched under strict anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees C with glucose as the sole carbon source. Biochemical hydrogen production test in peptone-yeast-glucose (PYG) and basal medium was performed for individual mixed cultures (C1, C2 and C3) and their combinations (C1-C2, C2-C3, C1-C3 and C1-C2-C3) at a glucose concentration of 10 g/L, 37 degrees C and initial pH 7. Maximum hydrogen yields (HY) of 2.0 and 1.86 [Formula: see text] by C2, and 1.98 and 1.95 mol(H2)/mol(glucose) by C2-C3 were obtained in PYG and basal medium, respectively. Butyrate and acetate were the major soluble metabolites produced by all the cultures, and the ratio of butyrate to acetate was approximately 2 fold higher in basal medium than PYG medium, indicating strong influence of media formulation on glucose catabolism. The major hydrogen-producing bacterial strains, observed in all mixed cultures, belonged to Clostridium butyricum, C. saccharobutylicum, C. tertium and C. perfringens. The hydrogen production performance of the combined mixed culture (C2-C3) was further evaluated on beverage wastewater (10 g/L) at pH 7 and 37 degrees C. The results showed an HY of 1.92 mol(H2)/mol(glucose-equivalent). Experimental evidence suggests that hydrogen fermentation by mixed culture combination could be a novel strategy to improve the HY from industrial wastewater.
TI  - Growth-Inhibiting and morphostructural effects of constituents identified in Asarum heterotropoides root on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The growth-inhibiting and morphostructural effects of seven constituents identified in Asarum heterotropoides root on 14 intestinal bacteria were compared with those of the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin. METHOD: A microtiter plate-based bioassay in sterile 96-well plates was used to evaluate the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the test materials against the organisms. RESULTS: delta-3-Carene (5) exhibited the most potent growth inhibition of Gram-positive bacteria (Clostridium difficile ATCC 9689, Clostridium paraputrificum ATCC 25780, Clostridium perfringens ATCC 13124, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 11775 and Bacteroides fragilis ATCC 25285) (minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC), 0.18-0.70 mg/mL) except for Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 13311 (MIC, 2.94 mg/mL). The MIC of methyleugenol (2), 1,8-cineole (3), alpha-asarone (4), (-)-asarinin (6), and pellitorine (7) was between 1.47 and 2.94 mg/mL against all test bacteria (except for compound 2 against C. difficile (0.70 mg/mL); compounds 1 (23.50 mg/mL) and 4 (5.80 mg/mL) against C. paraputricum; compounds 2 (5.80 mg/mL), 4 (12.0 mg/mL), and 7 (0.70 mg/mL) against C. perfringens); compound 1 against E. coli (7.20 mg/mL) and S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (12.0 mg/mL). Overall, all of the constituents were less potent at inhibiting microbial growth than ciprofloxacin (MIC, 0.063-0.25 mg/ mL). The lactic acid-producing bacteria (four bifidobacteria and two lactobacilli) and one acidulating bacterium Clostridium butyricum ATCC 25779 were less sensitive and more susceptible than the five harmful bacteria and two nonpathogenic bacteria (B. fragilis and E. coli) to the constituents and to ciprofloxacin, respectively. Beneficial Gram-positive bacteria and harmful and nonpathogenic Gram-negative bacteria were observed to have different degrees of antimicrobial susceptibility to the constituents, although the antimicrobial susceptibility of the harmful Gram-positive bacteria and the harmful and nonpathogenic Gram-negative bacteria was not observed. Scanning electron microscopy observations showed different degrees of physical damage and morphological alteration to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria treated with alpha-asarone, delta-3-carene, pellitorine, or ciprofloxacin, indicating that they do not share a common mode of action. CONCLUSION: A. heterotropoides root-derived materials described merit further study as potential antibacterial products or lead molecules for the prevention or eradication from humans from diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.
TI  - Genetic characteristics of toxigenic Clostridia and toxin gene evolution.
AB  - Clostridia comprise a heterogenous group of environmental bacteria containing 15  pathogenic species, which produce the most potent toxins. The origin of toxins is still enigmatic. It is hypothesized that toxins exhibiting an enzymatic activity have derived from hydrolytic enzymes, which are abundantly secreted by these bacteria, and that pore-forming toxins have evolved from an ancestor transmembrane protein. The presence of related toxin genes in distinct Clostridium species and the variability of some toxin genes support horizontal toxin gene transfer and subsequent independent evolution from strain to strain. Clostridium perfringens toxin genes involved in myonecrosis, mainly alpha toxin and perfringolysin genes, are chromosomally located, whereas toxin genes responsible for intestinal and food borne diseases are localized on plasmids except the enterotoxin gene which can be located either on the chromosome or plasmids. The distribution of these plasmids containing one or several toxin genes accounts for the diverse C. perfringens toxinotypes. Clostridium difficile strains show a high genetic variability. But in contrast to C. perfringens, toxin genes are clustered in pathogenicity locus located on chromosome. The presence of related toxin genes in distinct clostridial species like Clostridium sordellii, Clostridium novyi, and C. perfringens supports interspecies mobilization of this locus. The multiple C. difficile toxinotypes based on toxin gene variants possibly reflect strain adaptation to the intestinal environment. Botulinum toxin genes also show a high level of genetic variation. They have a diverse genetic localization including chromosome, plasmid or phage, and are spread in various Clostridium species (Clostridium botulinum groups, Clostridium argentinense, Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium baratii). Exchange of toxin genes not only include transfers between Clostridium species but also between Clostridium and other bacterial species as well as eukaryotic cells as supported by the wide distribution of related pore-forming toxins of the aerolysin family in various clostridial and non-clostridial species, animal, mushroom and plant.
TI  - Effects of antibiotics on bacterial species composition and metabolic activities  in chemostats containing defined populations of human gut microorganisms.
AB  - The composition and metabolic activities of the human colonic microbiota are modulated by a number of external factors, including diet and antibiotic therapy. Changes in the structure and metabolism of the gut microbiota may have long-term consequences for host health. The large intestine harbors a complex microbial ecosystem comprising several hundreds of different bacterial species, which complicates investigations on intestinal physiology and ecology. To facilitate such studies, a highly simplified microbiota consisting of 14 anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic organisms (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Clostridium butyricum, C. perfringens, C. bifermentans, C. innocuum, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus) was used in this investigation. Ampicillin [9.2 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to two chemostats operated at different dilution rates (D; 0.10 h(-1) and 0.21 h(-1)), and metronidazole [76.9 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to a third vessel (D = 0.21 h(-1)). Perturbations in bacterial physiology and metabolism were sampled over a 48-h period. Lactobacillus acidophilus and C. bifermentans populations did not establish in the fermentors under the imposed growth conditions. Ampicillin resulted in substantial reductions in bacteroides and C. perfringens populations at both dilution rates. Metronidazole strongly affected bacteroides communities but had no effect on bifidobacterial communities. The bacteriostatic effect of ampicillin on bifidobacterial species was growth rate dependent. Several metabolic activities were affected by antibiotic addition, including fermentation product formation and enzyme synthesis. The growth of antibiotic-resistant bifidobacteria in the large bowel may enable them to occupy ecological niches left vacant after antibiotic administration, preventing colonization by pathogenic species.
TI  - Longitudinal analyses of gut mucosal microbiotas in ulcerative colitis in relation to patient age and disease severity and duration.
AB  - Bacteria belonging to the normal colonic microbiota are associated with the etiology of ulcerative colitis (UC). Although several mucosal species have been implicated in the disease process, the organisms and mechanisms involved are unknown. The aim of this investigation was to characterize mucosal biofilm communities over time and to determine the relationship of these bacteria to patient age and disease severity and duration. Multiple rectal biopsy specimens were taken from 33 patients with active UC over a period of 1 year. Real-time PCR was used to quantify mucosal bacteria in UC patients compared to 18 noninflammatory bowel disease controls, and the relationship between indicators of disease severity and bacterial colonization was evaluated by linear regression analysis. Significant differences were detected in bacterial populations on the UC mucosa and in the control group, which varied over the study period. High clinical activity indices (CAI) and sigmoidoscopy scores (SS) were associated with enterobacteria, desulfovibrios, type E Clostridium perfringens, and Enterococcus faecalis, whereas the reverse was true for Clostridium butyricum, Ruminococcus albus, and Eubacterium rectale. Lactobacillus and bifidobacterium numbers were linked with low CAI. Only E. rectale and Clostridium clostridioforme had a high age dependence. These findings demonstrated that longitudinal variations in mucosal bacterial populations occur in UC and that bacterial community structure is related to disease severity.
TI  - Aberrant structures of fecal bacterial community in allergic infants profiled by  16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing.
AB  - We investigated the correlation between fecal bacteria composition in early infancy and the prevalence of allergic diseases in late infancy. The fecal microbiota in the first 2 months was profiled using the 16S rRNA V6 short-tag sequences in the community and statistically compared between two groups of subjects who did and did not show allergic symptoms in the first 2 years (n = 11 vs. 11). In the allergic group, genus Bacteroides at 1 month and genera Propionibacterium and Klebsiella at 2 months were more abundant, and genera Acinetobacter and Clostridium at 1 month were less abundant than in the nonallergic group. Allergic infants who showed high colonization of Bacteroides and/or Klebsiella showed less colonization of Clostridium perfringens/butyricum, suggesting antagonism between these bacterial groups in the gastrointestinal tract. It was also remarkable that the relative abundance of total Proteobacteria, excluding genus Klebsiella, was significantly lower in the allergic than in the nonallergic group at the age of 1 month. These results indicate that pyrosequence-based 16S rRNA gene profiling is valid to find the intestinal microbiotal disorder that correlates with allergy development in later life.
TI  - Oral administration of Clostridium butyricum for modulating gastrointestinal microflora in mice.
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the safety of Clostridium butyricum and to investigate the effect of C. butyricum on mice ecosystem in the intestinal tract by way of examining the population of different microorganisms isolated from caecal contents. We firstly evaluated the safety of C. butyricum using acute toxicity test and Ames test. Then forty male BALB/c mice were divided into the following four treatment groups, each consisting of ten mice: normal group, low-dose group, medium-dose group and high-dose group. Caecal contents were removed aseptically, immediately placed into an anaerobic chamber, and dissolved in sterile pre-reduced PBS. The determination of Enterococcus spp., Enterobacter spp., Lactobacillus spp., Bifidobacterium spp. and Clostridium perfringens was analyzed by the spread plate method, cell morphologies and biochemical profiles. The results showed the oral maximum tolerated dose of C. butyricum was more than 10 g/kg body weight in mice and no mutagenicity judged by negative experimental results of Ames test. And in medium- and high-dose groups, the populations of Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. increased in caecum, as well as the ratios of Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. to Clostridium perfringens (P < 0.01) as compared with the normal group. This research showed the intake of C. butyricum significantly improved the ecosystem of the intestinal tract in BALB/c mice by increasing the amount of probiotics and reducing the populations of unwanted bacteria.
TI  - Effect of COD/SO(4)2- ratio and Fe(II) under the variable hydraulic retention time (HRT) on fermentative hydrogen production.
AB  - The effect of chemical oxygen demand/sulfate (COD/SO(4)(2-)) ratio on fermentative hydrogen production using enriched mixed microflora has been studied. The chemostat system maintained with a substrate (glucose) concentration of 15 g COD L(-1) exhibited stable H(2) production at inlet sulfate concentrations of 0-20 g L(-1) during 282 days. The tested COD/SO(4)(2-) ratios ranged from 150 to 0.75 (with control) at pH 5.5 with hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 24, 12 and 6h. The hydrogen production at HRT 6h and pH 5.5 was not influenced by decreasing the COD/SO(4)(2-) ratio from 150 to 15 (with control) followed by noticeable increase at COD/SO(4)(2-) ratios of 5 and 3, but it was slightly decreased when the COD/SO(4)(2-) ratio further decreased to 1.5 and 0.75. These results indicate that high sulfate concentrations (up to 20,000 mg L(-1)) would not interfere with hydrogen production under the investigated experimental conditions. Maximum hydrogen production was 2.95, 4.60 and 9.40 L day(-1) with hydrogen yields of 2.0, 1.8 and 1.6 mol H(2) mol(-1) glucose at HRTs of 24, 12 and 6h, respectively. The volatile fatty acid (VFA) fraction produced during the reaction was in the order of butyrate>acetate>ethanol>propionate in all experiments. Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) analysis indicated the presence of Clostridium spp., Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium perfringens and Ruminococcus flavefaciens as hydrogen producing bacteria (HPB) and absence of sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) in our study.
TI  - Quality of silages from Italian farms as attested by number and identity of microbial indicators.
AB  - AIMS: This study evaluated the quality and possible hygiene risks related to farm-made silages by analysing the presence and number of micro-organisms that influence the preservation and safety in samples from four Italian regions. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lactic acid bacteria, clostridia, lactate-fermenting yeasts and propionibacteria (PAB) were isolated and identified by random amplified polymorphic DNA PCR, sequencing of the V2-V3 16S rRNA gene region, 5.8S-ITS rDNA RFLP and species-specific PCR. The Lactobacillus plantarum cluster was the most numerous and comprised strains mostly isolated from alfalfa silage. The Lactobacillus buchneri cluster, second in number, comprised isolates from both alfalfa and maize silage. Anaerobic spore formers were assigned to the species Clostridium baratii, Clostridium beijerinkii, Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium saccharolyticum, Clostridium tyrobutyricum and Paenibacillus macerans. Yeast isolates were identified as Candida apicola, Candida mesenterica and Pichia fermentans. PAB strains, detected only in unifeed, were all identified as Propionibacterium acidipropionici. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of spoiling micro-organisms was frequent and the possibility of contamination by potentially pathogenic clostridia was demonstrated. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results suggest the need for improved ensiling practices and appropriate control measures to safeguard the hygienic and nutritional quality of silages produced in farms.
TI  - Automated ribotyping for the identification and characterization of foodborne clostridia.
AB  - The DuPont Qualicon RiboPrinter was employed to determine if automated ribotyping could be used to differentiate between and characterize various species of foodborne clostridia. EcoRI digests were used to ribotype 49 isolates that represented seven Clostridium species: C. aerotolerans, C. beirjerinckii, C. botulinum, C. butyricum, C. perfringens, C. putrificum, and C. sporogenes. EcoRV digests were also used to ribotype 17 C. botulinum isolates to determine if an alternate restriction enzyme was more suitable than was EcoRI for toxin typing. It was concluded that the RiboPrinter could be potentially used to identify most of the clostridia represented in the study, but that the system has difficulty distinguishing between C. botulinum and C. sporogenes. The system may also be potentially used to characterize clostridia based on phenotypic characteristics. Toxin typing of clostridia remains problematic, but may be improved by the use of restriction enzyme combinations.
TI  - Evidence for clostridial implication in necrotizing enterocolitis through bacterial fermentation in a gnotobiotic quail model.
AB  - Despite extensive research, the pathogenesis of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) remains elusive. The aim of our work was to investigate the role of bacterial strains involved in NEC in gnotobiotic quails as experimental model. Six groups of germ-free quails that were fed a lactose diet were associated with Klebsiella pneumoniae, Clostridium perfringens, C. difficile, C. paraputrificum, or C. butyricum (two strains). Implantation level, incidence of cecal lesions, production of short-chain fatty acids, and histologic lesions of the cecal wall were investigated. Whatever the strain, the implantation level was high (10(9) UFC/g). Neither K. pneumoniae nor C. difficile induced any cecal lesions. In contrast, the four other clostridial strains led to cecal NEC-like lesions with a variable occurrence: four of 12 quails for C. perfringens, eight of 12 quails for C. paraputrificum, and the same highest value, nine of 12 quails and eight of 10 quails for both C. butyricum strains. Gross aspects of the lesions may be linked to the short-chain fatty acid profiles and/or concentrations: thickening of the cecal wall (C. butyricum and C. perfringens) with high proportion of butyric acid, hemorrhages (C. paraputrificum) with high proportion of iso-butyric acid, and presence of other iso-acids. In addition, C. butyricum was characterized by pneumatosis, linked to a high gas production. Microscopic aspects confirmed the presence of edemas and intramucosa hemorrhages. Clostridia species, whose role is controversial, seem to be strongly implicated in NEC through excessive production of butyric acid as a result of colonic lactose fermentation. These results call for anaerobe detection in feces of infants who have NEC.
TI  - Comparative genomic analysis of dha regulon and related genes for anaerobic glycerol metabolism in bacteria.
AB  - The dihydroxyacetone (dha) regulon of bacteria encodes genes for the anaerobic metabolism of glycerol. In this work, genomic data are used to analyze and compare the dha regulon and related genes in different organisms in silico with respect to gene organization, sequence similarity, and possible functions. Database searches showed that among the organisms, the genomes of which have been sequenced so far, only two, i.e., Klebsiella pneumoniae MGH 78578 and Clostridium perfringens contain a complete dha regulon bearing all known enzymes. The components and their organization in the dha regulon of these two organisms differ considerably from each other and also from the previously partially sequenced dha regulons in Citrobacter freundii, Clostridium pasteurianum, and Clostridium butyricum. Unlike all of the other organisms, genes for the oxidative and reductive pathways of anaerobic glycerol metabolism in C. perfringens are located in two separate organization units on the chromosome. Comparisons of deduced protein sequences of genes with similar functions showed that the dha regulon components in K. pneumoniae and C. freundii have high similarities (80-95%) but lower similarities to those of the Clostridium species (30-80%). Interestingly, the protein sequence similarities among the dha genes of the Clostridium species are in many cases even lower than those between the Clostridium species and K. pneumoniae or C. freundii, suggesting two different types of dha regulon in the Clostridium species studied. The in silico reconstruction and comparison of dha regulons revealed several new genes in the microorganisms studied. In particular, a novel dha kinase that is phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent is identified and experimentally confirmed for K. pneumoniae in addition to the known ATP-dependent dha kinase. This finding gives new insights into the regulation of glycerol metabolism in K. pneumoniae and explains some hitherto not well understood experimental observations.
TI  - Design of species-specific primers to identify 13 species of Clostridium harbored in human intestinal tracts.
AB  - The genus Clostridium is dominant in human intestinal tracts and plays an important role in human health. We designed species-specific primers to identify 13 species of Clostridium (C. perfringens, C. paraputrificum, C. bifermentans, C. difficile, C. clostridiiforme, C. nexile, C. sphenoides, C. indolis, C. ramosum, C. cocleatum, C. butyricum, C. sordellii, and C. innocuum) easily and rapidly. The PCR annealing temperature was set at a uniform 60 C for application to all strains at the same time. To confirm the specificities of these primers, 85 intestinal bacteria in total, including type strains, reference strains, and isolates were used. Ten primers (including those for C. perfringens to C. cocleatum) indicated high specificities. Although there were some cross-reactions with the other three primers, the target species were distinguishable from other bacteria by the different sizes of PCR products.
TI  - Enumeration of viable anaerobic bacteria by solid phase cytometry under aerobic conditions.
AB  - Classical enumeration methods for anaerobes are time-consuming and require special conditions. Solid phase cytometry (SPC) is a recent laser scanning technique for the quantitative detection of fluorescently labelled bacteria on a membrane filter that eliminates the need for a growth phase. Fluorescent labelling of cells results from the cleavage by intracellular esterases of a fluorescein type ester to yield a free fluorescein derivative, which is retained only in cells with an intact cytoplasmic membrane. However, as the standard labelling procedure is carried out under the conditions of aerobiosis, labelling of anaerobic bacteria does not appear to be obvious. We have labelled eight strains of vegetative anaerobic bacteria (i.e. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Clostridium bifermentans, C. butyricum, C. perfringens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas canoris, P. gingivalis, Propionibacterium acnes) and two strains of spores (C. butyricum, C. perfringens,) within 4 h under aerobic conditions. However, anaerobiosis remained necessary for spores of C. sordellii, C. sporogenes, C. tyrobutyricum. For vegetative cells of all strains, plots of SPC versus plate counts were linear with slopes exceeding 1.0, indicating that SPC consistently yielded higher numbers of bacteria.
TI  - Gene transfer to Clostridium cellulolyticum ATCC 35319.
AB  - Although much is known about the bacterial cellulosome and its various protein components, their contributions to bacterial growth on cellulose and the process of cellulolysis in vivo cannot currently be assessed. To remedy this, the authors have developed gene transfer techniques for Clostridium cellulolyticum ATCC 35319. Firstly, transfer of Tn1545 has been obtained using an Enterococcus faecalis donor. Secondly, IncP-mediated conjugative mobilization of plasmids from Escherichia coli donors has also been achieved. The yield of transconjugants in both cases was low and was probably limited by the suboptimal growth conditions that must of necessity be employed for the co-culture of oligotrophic C. cellulolyticum with copiotrophic donors. A restriction endonuclease was detected in crude extracts of C. cellulolyticum. This enzyme, named CCE:I, is an isoschizomer of MSP:I (HPA:II). Electro-transformation was employed to establish plasmids containing the replication functions of pAMss1 (En. faecalis), pIM13 (Bacillus subtilis), pCB102 (Clostridium butyricum), pIP404 (Clostridium perfringens) and pWV01 (Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris) in C. cellulolyticum. Transformants were only obtained if the DNA was appropriately methylated on the external C of the sequence 5'-CCGG-3' using either BSU:FI methylase in vivo or MSP:I methylase in vitro. Plasmids based on the pAMss1 and pIM13 replicons were more stably maintained than one based on the pCB102 replicon. Selection of transformants on solid medium led to low apparent transformation efficiencies (approx. 10(2) transformants per microg DNA) which might, in part, reflect the low plating efficiency of the organism. Selection of transformants in liquid medium led to a higher apparent yield of transformants (between 10(5) and 10(7) transformants per microg DNA). The methods developed here will pave the way for functional analysis of the various cellulosome components in vivo.
TI  - Occurrence of nisin Z production in Lactococcus lactis BFE 1500 isolated from wara, a traditional Nigerian cheese product.
AB  - Screening for bacteriocin production of 500 strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from various African fermented foods resulted in the detection of a bacteriocin producing Lactococcus lactis (BFE 1500) isolated from a dairy product called wara. The bacteriocin inhibited not only the closely related LAB, but also strains of Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua, Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillis cereus and Staphylococcus aureus. It was heat stable even at autoclaving temperature (121 degrees C for 15 min) and was active over a wide pH range (2-10), but highest activity was observed in the lower pH range. The bacteriocin was inactivated by alpha-chymotrypsin and proteinase K, but not by other proteases. Growth kinetic assay indicated stronger growth inhibition by the bacteriocin produced by Lc. lactis BFE 1500 on L. monocytogenes WS 2250 and B. cereus DSM 2301 than with the nisin A producing strain DSM 20729. Polymerase chain reaction indicated the presence of the nisin operon in strain BFE 1500 and sequencing of its structural gene showed that Lc. lactis BFE 1500 produced the natural nisin variant, nisin Z, as indicated by the substitution of asparagine residue instead of histidine at position 27. The genetic determinants for bacteriocin production in strain BFE 1500 are located on a conjugative transposon. The ability of the bacteriocin produced by Lc. lactis BFE 1500 to inhibit a wide range of food-borne pathogens is of special interest for food safety, especially in the African environment with perennial problems of poor food hygiene.
TI  - Ecological and physiological studies on large intestinal bacteria in relation to  production of hydrolytic and reductive enzymes involved in formation of genotoxic metabolites.
AB  - Several hydrolytic and reductive bacterial enzymes (beta-glucuronidase, GN; beta-glucosidase, GS; arylsulphatase, AS; azoreductase, AR; nitroreductase, NR) involved in production of mutagenic or genotoxic metabolites were measured in human colonic contents. Cell-associated AS and extracellular GS were approximately twice as high in the distal colon compared with the proximal bowel, while AR changed little throughout the gut. Measurements of these enzymes in faeces from seven healthy donors confirmed that the majority were cell-associated, and demonstrated high levels of inter-individual variability. NR decreased four-fold between the proximal and distal colon while extracellular GN was reduced by 50%. Most probable number (MPN) analysis on faeces obtained from six healthy donors showed that counts of intestinal bacteria producing GS and AR were c. 10(10) and 10(11)/g, respectively, in all samples tested. Numbers of GN- and AS-forming organisms were between two and three orders of magnitude lower. Inter-individual carriage rates of bacterial populations synthesising NR were highly variable. Screening of 20 pure cultures of intestinal bacteria, belonging to six different genera, showed that Bacteroides ovatus, in particular, synthesised large amounts of GS, whereas B. fragilis, B. vulgatus and Bifidobacterium pseudolongum formed the highest cell-associated levels of GN. In general, bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus acidophilus did not produce significant amounts of AR. All five clostridia studied (Clostridium bifermentans, C. septicum, C. perfringens, C. sporogenes and C. butyricum) produced NR and AR, as did the bacteroides (B. fragilis, B. ovatus and B. vulgatus). Escherichia coli and C. perfringens formed large amounts of NR. Levels of AS production were invariably low and few of the organisms screened synthesised this enzyme. In-vitro studies investigating the effect of intestinal transit time on enzyme production, in a three-stage (V1-V3) continuous culture model of the colon operated at system retention times (R) of either 31.1 or 68.4 h, showed that specific activities of GS were up to four-fold higher (V3) at R = 31.1 h. Bacteriological analysis demonstrated that representative populations of colonic micro-organisms were maintained in the fermentation system, and indicated that changes in GS activity were not related to numbers of the predominant anaerobic or facultative anaerobic species within the model, but were explainable on the basis of substrate-induced modulation of bacterial metabolism.
TI  - Clostridial pathogenicity in experimental necrotising enterocolitis in gnotobiotic quails and protective role of bifidobacteria.
AB  - The pathogenesis of neonatal necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) remains unclear. Gnotobiotic quails fed a lactose diet have been used to investigate the role of clostridial strains originating from faecal specimens of neonates through the intestinal lesions, the changes in microflora balance and the production of bacterial metabolites, i.e., short-chain fatty acids and hydrogen. Bifidobacteria are thought to exert various beneficial effects on host health, including interaction with the colonic microflora. Therefore, it was hypothesised that a protective role could be exercised through bifidobacterial colonisation. A Clostridium butyricum strain (CB 155-3) and a whole faecal flora including three clostridial species (C. butyricum, C. perfringens, C. difficile), each from premature infants suffering from NEC, caused caecal lesions in quails similar to those observed in man, i.e., thickening of the caecal wall with gas cysts, haemorrhagic ulceration and necrotic areas. Conversely, a whole faecal flora including bifidobacteria (identified as Bifidobacterium pseudo-catenulatum) and no clostridia, isolated from a healthy premature infant, was unable to produce NEC-like lesions. When the two clostridial groups were associated with a Bifidobacterium strain (B. infantis-longum, CUETM 89-215, isolated from a healthy infant), bifidobacterial colonisation suppressed all pathological lesions. This study is the first demonstration of a protective role for bifidobacteria against NEC via the inhibition of growth of C. butyricum or the disappearance of C. perfringens. C. difficile was not found to be responsible for the aetiology of the caecal lesions in quails. The main effect of bifidobacteria on lactose fermentation was either a dramatic decrease or a disappearance of butyric acid. The protective role was not associated with changes in H2 production. Therefore, a new step between colonic colonisation and its relevance to NEC is thought to involve the fermentation of unabsorbed lactose into butyric acid at the onset of the disease.
TI  - Growth of a human intestinal Desulfovibrio desulfuricans in continuous cultures containing defined populations of saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting bacteria.
AB  - Ecological and physiological effects of the sulphate-reducing bacterium (SRB) Desulfovibrio desulfuricans on other intestinal organisms were investigated in anaerobic chemostats (dilution rate approximately 0.2 h-1). Reproducible defined bacterial communities were used in these experiments, comprising 14 different saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting species: Bifidobacterium longum, Bif. adolescentis, Bif. pseudolongum, Bif. infantis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bact. vulgatus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. faecium, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Cl. butyricum, Cl. innocuum, Cl. bifermentans. Lactobacillus and Cl. bifermentans populations never rose above minimum detection limits (log10 2.0 and 4.0, respectively) under the experimental conditions employed in these studies. Inclusion of Des. desulfuricans in bacterial cultures (c. log10 8.4 viable cells ml-1) resulted in marked reductions (i.e. greater than 1 log) in planktonic cell population densities of several species, particularly Bif. longum, Cl. perfringens and Bif. pseudolongum. The two bacteroides species were unaffected by Des. desulfuricans, while numbers of Cl. butyricum increased. Extensive wall growth developed in the SRB culture, consisting mainly of Des. desulfuricans (log10 9.2 viable cells ml-1), Bact. thetaiotaomicron and Bact. vulgatus, with lesser numbers of facultative anaerobes, Cl. perfringens and Bif. longum. Wall growth was associated with a reduction in planktonic cell mass and increased acid production by the cultures. Chemotaxonomic study of chemostat microbiotas, on the basis of cellular fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analyses, showed the existence of characteristic bacteroides (C15) and bifidobacterial (C18) markers, but desulfovibrio markers (i-C15:0, C16:0, i-C17:1) could be identified. The metabolic activities of saccharolytic organisms were altered in the SRB chemostat, including synthesis of a number of hydrolytic enzymes involved in carbohydrate breakdown, such as alpha-galactosidase, alpha-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase, together with several mucinolytic enzymes. High concentrations of sulphide (8.2 mmol 1-1) were detected in the SRB chemostat, suggesting that this metabolite may have been inhibitory to some species. Saccharolytic organisms growing in the SRB fermenter utilized more starch, but less galactose-containing polymers, which correlated with the observed glycosidase activities. Profound differences were also recorded with respect to fermentation product formation in the chemostats, where a major switch to acetate production occurred in the SRB culture, with concomitant reductions in propionate, butyrate and lactate, which is an important electron donor for desulfovibrios.
TI  - Clostridial infection in children.
AB  - A survey of the isolation of Clostridium spp. from 1543 specimens sent to anaerobic microbiology laboratories revealed 113 isolates from 107 specimens (7.0% of all specimens) from 96 children. The isolates comprised 43 (38%) unidentified Clostridium spp., 37 (33%) C. perfringens, 13 (12%) C. ramosum, five (4%) C. innocuum, six (5%) C. botulinum, three (3%) C. difficile, two (2%) C. butyricum, and one isolate each of C. bifermentans, C. clostridiiforme, C. limosum and C. paraputrificum. Most clostridial isolates were from abscesses (38), peritonitis (26), bacteraemia (10), and chronic otitis media (7). Predisposing or underlying conditions were present in 31 (32%) cases. These were immunodeficiency (12), malignancy (9), diabetes (7), trauma (7), presence of a foreign body (6) and previous surgery (6). The clostridia were the only bacterial isolates in 14 (15%) cases; 82 (85%) cases had mixed infection. The species most commonly isolated with clostridia were anaerobic cocci (57); Bacteroides spp. (B. fragilis group) (50), Escherichia coli (22), pigmented Prevotella or Porphyromonas spp. (18) and Fusobacterium spp. (10). Most Bacteroides and Escherichia coli isolates with clostridia were from abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections adjacent to the rectal area; most pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas isolates were from oropharyngeal, pulmonary, and head and neck sites. Antimicrobial therapy was given to all patients, in conjunction with surgical drainage in 34 (35%). Only two patients died. These data illustrate the importance of Clostridium spp. in paediatric infections.
TI  - Trypsin-dependent production of an antibacterial substance by a human Peptostreptococcus strain in gnotobiotic rats and in vitro.
AB  - An antibacterial substance appeared within 1 day in feces of gnotobiotic rats harboring a human intestinal Peptostreptococcus strain. It disappeared when the rat bile-pancreatic duct was ligatured or when the rats ingested a trypsin inhibitor. Anaerobic cultures of the Peptostreptococcus strain in a medium supplemented with trypsin also exhibited an antibacterial activity, which was also inhibited by the trypsin inhibitor. In vitro the antibacterial substance from both feces and culture medium was active against several gram-positive bacteria, including other Peptostreptococcus spp., potentially pathogenic Clostridium spp. such as C. perfringens, C. difficile, C. butyricum, C. septicum, and C. sordellii, Eubacterium spp., Bifidobacterium spp., and Bacillus spp. Whatever the order of inoculation of the strains, a sensitive strain of C. perfringens was eliminated within 1 day from the intestine of rats monoassociated with the Peptostreptococcus strain. These findings demonstrate for the first time that very potent antibacterial substances can be produced through a mechanism involving intestinal bacteria and exocrine pancreatic secretions.
TI  - Comparative sequence analysis of the catB gene from Clostridium butyricum.
AB  - Sequence analysis of the Clostridium butyricum chloramphenicol acetyltransferase  (CAT) gene, catB, showed that it encoded a CAT monomer of 219 amino acids with a molecular weight of 26,114. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of the CATB monomer to those of sixteen other CATs showed that it was most closely related to the CATQ monomer from Clostridium perfringens.
TI  - [Study on ursodeoxycholic acid biotransformation by three strains of clostridia].
AB  - Using the improved TLC procedure, we measured the conversion rates of ursodeoxycholic acid(UDCA) from chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) by 3 strains of clostridia--C. perfringens HS-10, C. butyricum DL-20 and LQ-29 isolated. The orthogonal test was used to determine the optical conditions of biotransformation for HS-10. It was found that the conversion rate of UDCA by HS-10 was over 80% during 6-48 h in RCM medium containing 0.2 mmol/L CDCA. The UDCA conversion rates were still over 70% when the CDCA concentrations were as high as 0.8-1.0 mmol/L. In addition, the WW-BCP (Waste water from bean curd production) without any supplemental nutrients was preliminarily proved to be a potential inexpensive conversion medium.
TI  - Formation of amphetamine from its nitro analogue by anaerobic intestinal bacteria.
AB  - 1. Microbial reduction of 1-phenyl-2-nitropropane 1 was carried out using 40 strains of intestinal anaerobic bacteria. Among them, 12 strains (Mitsuokella multiacidus, Clostridium perfringens, C. innocuum, C. clostiriiforme, C. difficile, C. butyricum, C. sp., Eubacterium limosum, E. aerofaciens, E. multiforme, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and P. productus) had the ability to reduce 1 to amphetamine 2 (0.1-1% yield). 2. Clostridium species were more active than another intestinal anaerobic bacteria. 3. When Clostridium perfringens was used in preparative fermentation, the yield of 2 was increased, and its absolute structure had an (S)-configuration with an optical purity of 68% in enantiomeric excess.
TI  - Spoilage of an acid food product by Clostridium perfringens, C. barati and C. butyricum.
AB  - Spoilage of canned pasteurized brined mung bean sprouts, acidified with citric acid to pH 4.0-4.5, was found to be caused by acid tolerant Clostridium spp. including the species barati, perfringens and butyricum. The pH limit for growth in the brine used were estimated 3.7, 3.7 and 4.0 respectively. Some of the isolated C. perfringens strains produced enterotoxins in sporulation media. The spores of the isolated anaerobes appeared to originate from mung beans, but C. barati and C. perfringens strains freshly isolated from dry beans, were unable to grow in acidified brine. During germination and sprouting of mung beans, the oxygen concentration decreased, while carbon dioxide concentration increased considerably, due to respiration of the sprouts and actively growing Enterobacteriaceae and lactobacilli. It was assumed that this allowed C. barati and C. perfringens strains to grow and acquire the observed unusual acid tolerance. After increasing aerobicity during sprouting, no growth of Clostridium spp. was observed, substantiating the assumption.
TI  - [Morphological changes in human embryonic lung fibroblasts caused by cytotoxins of various Clostridium species].
AB  - A total of 243 strains of 35 Clostridium species were tested for cytotoxin production in cooked meat medium or liver broth within 48-72 h at 37 degrees C, using human embryonal lung fibroblasts in tissue-culture as indicator cells. Cytotoxin could be detected in the culture-filtrates of all toxigenic strains of C. chauvoei, C. difficile, C. histolyticum, C. novyi types A and B, C. septicum and C. tetani, but not in the atoxigenic ones. The cytotoxin of C. novyi correlated with alpha-toxin in the culture filtrate. All strains of C. perfringens and C. novyi D tested were not cytotoxic for lung fibroblasts despite their pathogenicity for guinea-pigs. Further cytotoxigenic strains were found among C. hastiforme, C. limosum, C. oceanicum, C. putrificum, C. ramosum, C. sordellii, C. sporogenes, and C. subterminale. The morphological changes in lung fibroblasts caused by the culture filtrates were characteristic and species-specific and corresponded with pathogenicity for guinea-pigs and/or mice. No cytotoxin was produced by C. absonum, C. barati, C. bifermentans, C. botulinum (atoxic), C. butyricum, C. cadaveris, C. carnis, C. clostridioforme, C. cochlearium, C. glycolicum, C. innocuum, C. malenominatum, C. mangenotii, C. paraputrificum, C. putrefaciens, C. rectum, C. tertium, and C. tyrobutyricum.
TI  - Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Clostridium spp. in fecal samples from breast-fed and bottle-fed infants with and without iron supplement.
AB  - Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Clostridium spp. isolated from the feces of 23  neonates during the first 3 months of life were identified. Of the 23 neonates, 10 were breast fed, 6 received an infant formula with iron supplement (5 mg/liter), and 7 received the formula without iron supplement (iron concentration, less than 0.5 mg/liter). The Bifidobacterium spp. most frequently isolated from the three groups of infants were B. longum, B. breve, B. adolescentis, and B. bifidum. The bacteroides spp. most frequently isolated were B. fragilis and B. vulgatus. The most common Clostridium sp. in the three groups of infants was C. perfringens. The type of milk did not select for species of Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, or Clostridium, except for Clostridium butyricum, which was isolated significantly more often from bottle-fed infants with iron supplement than from the other groups, and Clostridium tertium, which was more often isolated from breast-fed infants. The species of the three anaerobic genera did not persist for a long period of time in the three groups of infants.
TI  - Pathogenicity of Clostridium species with other bacteria in mixed infections.
AB  - The relationship of clostridial isolates with other bacteria in mixed infections  was studied by means of a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. We used 26 isolates of seven clostridial species, two Bacteroides spp., eight Gram-positive facultative or anaerobic cocci and three enteric Gram-negative aerobic rods. Abscesses were induced by all seven Clostridium perfringens and three C. butyricum isolates and by some of the others. Selective antimicrobial therapy experiments showed that enteric Gram-negative rods were of equal or greater significance in the formation of abscesses than were clostridial strains in mixed infections. Enhancement or suppression of each component of the mixed infection was studied by comparing the number of each bacterium to its number when injected alone. Enhancement was observed mainly with C. perfringens in mixed infections. By contrast, other Clostridium spp. were less able to induce enhancement. Clostridium difficile and C. sporogenes often inhibited other bacterial species. This study demonstrated the synergistic and antagonistic relationship between clostridial species and other bacteria.
TI  - [Comparison between the number and nature of fecal clostridia and other risk factors implicated in the intestinal pathology of newborn infants].
AB  - One-hundred and fifteen infants aged 1 to 31 days from two intensive-care units were grouped into 6 classes according to clinical criteria (enterocolitis with or without anatomopathological examination and pneumatosis intestinalis, "haemorrhagic colitis", acute diarrhoea or absence of intestinal disorders). The total number of viable bacteria, the number of Clostridium and, in some cases, the presence of rota- and/or coronavirus were determined in their stools. The incidence of Clostridium in the stools of infants with enterocolitis (with or without pneumatosis intestinalis) or haemorrhagic colitis was not significantly different from that of infants without intestinal disorders, whereas stools of infants with acute diarrhoea less often contained Clostridium than those of other infants. C. butyricum, C. difficile, C. perfringens, C. tertium, and C. sordellii were identified. Correspondence analysis comparing the variable, "clinical profile", with 23 other variables, suggested that the variables of gemellity, a birthweight below 1900 g, a gestational age of less than 35 weeks, respiratory distress, umbilical catheterization and a Clostridium count above 10(7)/g at the onset of clinical signs, i.e. between 8 to 12 days of age, were linked to the clinical profile of necrotizing enterocolitis with pneumatosis intestinalis. Conversely, the absence of gemellity, a high birthweight and gestational age, the absence of respiratory distress or umbilical catheterization, the onset of diarrhoea within 8 days, and the presence of rota- and/or coronavirus in the stools were linked with a clinical profile of acute diarrhoea.
TI  - Changes in the cell wall of Clostridium species following passage in animals.
AB  - Morphological changes in clostridial isolates after animal passage with other flora in mixed infections were studied by utilizing a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. We used 26 isolates of 7 clostridial species, and one isolate each of Bacteroides fragilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Abscesses were induced by all 7 Clostridium perfringens and 3 Clostridium butyricum isolates and by some of the other isolates. A thick granular wall prior to animal inoculation was shown only in C. perfringens, C. butyricum, and C. difficile. This structure was observed in other clostridia only following their animal passage alone or when co-inoculated with K. pneumoniae or B. fragilis.
TI  - Enteric colonization in sporadic neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis.
AB  - Microflora of the gut was studied close to the onset of sporadic necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in neonates. Enteric flora in 25 babies with NEC differed from that in 23 matched controls. Bacteroides spp and lactobacilli were less common in babies with NEC compared with controls: 32 versus 61% (p = 0.03) and 12 versus 48% (p = 0.006), respectively. Clostridium perfringens was isolated from 40% of babies with NEC compared with 13% of controls (p = 0.03). It was present in 33% of babies with NEC aged less than 14 days but was not detected in control babies of the same age. The incidences of C. butyricum and C. difficile were similar in patients and controls. Colonization with C. perfringens in the absence of a protective barrier flora may be crucial in the pathogenesis of severe sudden onset NEC. Two potentially valuable marker factors to predict onset of this form of sporadic NEC are the use of fecal smears and estimation of fecal tryptic activity.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of clinical isolates of clostridia.
AB  - Over a 2 1/2 year period 361 clinical isolates of clostridia, representing 28 species, were tested for susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobial agents. Penicillin resistant strains were tested for their ability to produce beta-lactamase: of the commonly isolated species only Clostridium beijerinckii/butyricum produced the enzyme. Cl. perfringens exhibited a low incidence of resistance to all of the agents tested. Cl. difficile showed a high degree of resistance to penicillin and clindamycin, whilst all strains were sensitive to vancomycin. Chloramphenicol and amoxycillin/clavulanic acid were found to be highly active against most clostridia; metronidazole was the only agent to which no resistance was demonstrable.
TI  - Development of gut colonisation in pre-term neonates.
AB  - Twenty-eight pre-term babies of low birth weight were monitored for developing microflora in throat, stomach and faeces during the first 3 weeks of life. The flora at all levels of the gastrointestinal tract differed from that of healthy breast-fed and artificially fed full-term babies. Colonisation of throat and stomach was delayed beyond 4 days of life in 87% and 60% of babies respectively. Only 10% of babies had "normal" oral flora throughout the period of study. Flora of the stomach was sparse, and resembled faecal flora. Faecal flora was established more rapidly than throat or stomach flora, and 70% of babies were colonised during the first 4 days of life. Initially Bacteroides spp. were predominant (57% babies), but Escherichia coli and other aerobic gram-negative bacilli gradually increased in frequency. Colonisation by gram-positive bacteria was slow. Clostridium spp. were present in only 10% of babies during the first 4 days of life. Most strains were transient. Colonisation with C. butyricum (30%), C. perfringens (35%) and C. difficile (25%) was maximum after the first 2 weeks of life. Lactic-acid-producing bacteria usually appeared late in the third week of life. Parenteral feeding immediately after birth was associated with delayed colonisation by a restricted number of species. Parenteral antibiotics (penicillin or gentamicin or both) restricted colonisation with normal oral flora, the lactic-acid-producing bacteria and penicillin-sensitive clostridia, but had little effect on E. coli even when the colonising strain was sensitive to the aminoglycoside in the regimen. Systemic spread of bacteria via the blood stream was not detected in any babies. The pattern of colonisation of the enteric tract in pre-term infants in the special-care nursery studied, differs from that of healthy full-term babies; this merits consideration when the results of bacteriological tests of this vulnerable group of infants are being interpreted.
TI  - Clostridia isolated from the feces of infants during the first year of life.
AB  - Clostridia isolated from the feces of ten healthy infants during the first year of life were identified. All infants excreted clostridia during the first week of life; the most common species were Clostridium butyricum, C. paraputrificum, and C. difficile. In the formula-fed infants colonization occurred consistently throughout the year, whereas in some breast-fed infants it was inhibited until weaning. The species isolated most frequently throughout the year were C. paraputrificum, C. butyricum, C. ramosum, C. sartagoformum, and C. perfringens. Of the species often found in infants, C. butyricum, C. difficile, and C. sartagoformum occur rarely in adults, reflecting differences in the environmental conditions in the gut of the two age groups. The mechanism by which environmental conditions select species of clostridia is unknown but may be important to our understanding of a variety of clostridial intestinal infections. It was demonstrated that species of clostridia which have been implicated in the etiology of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis form part of the normal infant gastrointestinal microflora.
TI  - [Simplified preliminary identification of some species of Clostridium].
AB  - A dichotomous key is proposed for the identification of eight species of Clostridium: Clostridium botulinum, C. butyricum, C. haemolyticum, C. histolyticum, C. paraperfringens, C. perfringens, C. sporogenes y C. subterminale, on the basis of the Gram staining, catalase production, growth on nutrient agar, glucose utilization, motility test, gelatin hydrolysis, lecithinase production, human blood hemolysis and the test of mice toxicity.
TI  - [Numerical taxonomy of gram-positive anaerobic bacilli].
AB  - Numerical Taxonomy's techniques were employed on twenty one anaerobic Gram positive bacilli strains taking account of eighty morphologic and biochemical features. Two methods of coding (weighted and non weighted) and four clustering methods (unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages; weighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages; single linkage and complete linkage) were used. Eight dendrograms were obtained and they showed that C. haemolyticum (strains 1, 2, 4, 7); C. subterminale (strains 8, 19); C. botulinum (strain 14) and C. sporogenes (strain 15) belong to a different group than the other strains. Another group would be formed with C. perfringens (strains 3, 5, 6, 12, 16, 21) and C. paraperfringens (strains 9, 10, 11). Of the remaining strains the two classified as Propionibacterium acnes (strains 17, 18) have a very high degree of agreement. C. histolyticum (strain 20) adjoins at a very low level, while C. butyricum (strain 13) shows a unfixed behaviour. The dendrograms display a disposition according with Classical Taxonomy.
TI  - [Changes in the serum acid phosphatase activity of guinea pigs poisoned with C1 perfringens type A toxin and a mixture of toxin and a broth culture filtrate].
AB  - It was shown in experiments on guinea pigs that the injection of C1. perfringens  type A toxoid induced an increase in acid phosphatase activity of animal blood serum. The action of the toxoid increased under the effect of C1. butyricum cultural filtrate, which gave rise to an earlier enhancement of the specific activity of the enzyme as compared to the injection of the toxoid alone. Increased activity of acid phosphatase may play a pathogenetic role in cases of anaerobic infection caused by association of C1. perfringens and C1. butyricum.
TI  - Metronidazole bioassay with increased sensitivity.
AB  - The bioassay of metronidazole using Clostridium butyricum incorporated in agar plates detected concentrations higher than 1.0 microgram/ml. Gentamicin in the sample did not affect the growth of the target organism or the inhibition by metronidazole. Penicillin in the sample could be eliminated by the incorporation of penicillinase in the agar or by using as the target organism a surface inoculum of the penicillin-resistant Bacteroides fragilis. Increasing duration and temperature of aerobic prediffusion before allowing the growth of the strictly anaerobic Cl. butyricum increased the diameters of inhibition by metronidazole, but did not affect the threshold of detectability. The incorporation of metronidazole in the agar increased the sensitivity of the assay ten- to 100-fold.
TI  - [Use of the reversed passive hemagglutination in detection of Clostridium botulinum type A, B, and E toxin (author's transl)].
AB  - With the reversed passive hemagglutination technique it is possible to detect minimal amounts of botulinum type A, B and E toxins (s. Tab. 3). The antisera are used were prepared by foot--pad injection of rabbits with purified toxoids in Freund's complete adjuvant (s. Tab. 1). Antitoxin globulin were prepared from rabbit antisera with (NH4)2SO4 to 50%. Formalinized and tanned human erythrozytes were sensitized with these specific antitoxin globulins. Only slight cross reactions ere encountered between the type A, B, and E antiglobulin sensitized cells and culture filtrates of C. butyricum, C. sporogenes (type A and B antiglobulin only) and C. perfringens type C (s. Tab. 4).
TI  - [Microcirculatory changes following the combined action of the toxin of C1. perfringens type A and biological products of C1. butyricum].
AB  
TI  - [Changes in the electrical activity of the cerebral cortex under the combined influence of Cl. perfringens type A toxin and products of Cl. butyricum activity].
AB  - A study of the changes of the electrocorticogram (ECoG) and the electrocardiogram (ECG) in combined action of Cl. perfringens, type A, and of the Cl. butyricum broth culture filtrate showed that desynchronization of the cortical electrical activity and its subsequent depression occurred at earlier periods than in the case of isolated administration of Cl. perfringens toxin. The general character of the changes in the cortical rhythmic activity remained the same as in intoxication caused by Cl. butyricum toxin alone. The ECoG and ECG changes occurred at shorter intervals. Cl. butyricum filtrates induced no ECoG and ECG changes. It is supposed that the effect of the products of the Cl. butyricum vital activity consisted in increase in the tissue barrier permeability and, in this connection, in a greater penetration of Cl. perfringens toxin into the tissues, including the central nervous system.
TI  - Clostridia in soil of the Antarctica.
AB  - From the soil in the area around the Syowa Station, the East Ongul Island, the Antarctica, a total of 193 strains of clostridia were isolated and identified. It was surprising that the soil samples taken from the places which were considered to be scarcely contaminated by human beings and animals contained many clostridia. One hundred and fifty-five strains were assigned to 11 species, including C. perfringens, C. bifermentans, C. sordellii, C. sporogenes, C. plagarum, C. paraperfringens, C. septicum, C. tertium, C. cadaveris, C. butyricum and C. felsineum, but 38 strains remained unidentified. C. perfringens, C. bifermentans and C. sordellii were isolated very frequently and C. sporogenes less frequently. All the strains of C. sordellii were nonpathogenic and had almost the same characteristics as those of C. bifermentans except for the attitude in the urease test. The peculiar distribution and characteristics of the clostridia in the Antarctic soil were discussed in comparison with those found in the soil in Japan.
TI  - Taxonomy of the Clostridia: ribosomal ribonucleic acid homologies among the species.
AB  - rRNA homologies have been determined on reference strains representing 56 species of Clostridium. Competition experiments using tritium-labelled 23S rRNA were employed. The majority of the species had DNA with 27 to 28% guanine plus cytosine (%GC). These fell into rRNA homology groups I and II, which were well defined, and a third group which consisted of species which did not belong in groups I and II. Species whose DNA was 41 to 45% GC comprised a fourth group. Thirty species were placed into rRNA homology group I on the basis of having 50% or greater homology with Clostridium butyricum, C. perfringens, C. carnis, C. sporogenes, C. novyi or C. pasteurianum. Ten subgroups were delineated in homology group I. Species in each subgroup either had high homology with a particular reference species or a similar pattern of homologies to all of the reference organisms. The eleven species in rRNA homology group II had 69% or greater homology to C. lituseburense. Species in groups I and II had intergroup homologies of 20 to 40%. The six species in group II had very low homologies with groups I and II. Negligible homology also resulted when five of the species were tested against the sixth, C. ramosum. The five species having DNA with 41 to 45% GC were C. innocuum, C. sphenoides, C. indolis, C. barkeri and C. orotic um. Little rRNA homology was apparent between C. innocuum and the other high % GC species or with several Bacillus species having similar %GC DNA. Correlations between homology results and phenotypic characteristics are discussed.
TI  - Purification of two Clostridium bacteriocins by procedures appropriate to hydrophobic proteins.
AB  - Two clostridocins distinguishable by their different modes of action on Clostridium pasteurianum have been isolated, namely, butyricin 7423 found in cultures of Clostridium butyricum NCIB 7423 and perfringocin 11105 produced by Clostridium perfringens type A, NCIB 11105. Both were trypsin-susceptible proteins which were soluble in concentrated aqueous ethanol and were able to bind large amounts of the nonionic detergent Triton X-100. In the presence of Triton X-100, butyricin 7423 behaved as a hydrophobic protein in being concentrated in the polyethylene glycol layer of a three-phase partition system of dextran-Ficoll-polyethylene glycol. Their capacity to bind Triton X-100 was exploited in a purification procedure applicable to both bacteriocins. After aqueous ethanol extraction of an ammonium sulfate-precipitated fraction (and, in the case of the perfringocin, a heat-treatment step), a bacteriocin-Triton X-100 adduct was purified by gel filtration through Sepharose 6B. The bacteriocin was then freed of Triton X-100 by chromatography on Sephadex LH-20. Samples of butyricin 7423 purified in this way from different sources contained variable amounts of carbohydrate. Yet sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis revealed the existence of a polypeptide component of 32,500 daltons (+/-10%), which displayed the biological activity of butyricin 7423 in the absence of any detectable associated carbohydrate (or lipid). Preparations of perfringocin 11105 contained no carbohydrate or lipid and migrated in sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis as a single protein component of 76,000 daltons (+/-10%). It was concluded that both bacteriocins behave as amphiphilic proteins, and some implications of this finding are considered.
