TI  == construction of new cloning, lacz reporter and scarless-markerless suicide vectors for genetic studies in aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == to elucidate the putative function of a gene, effective tools are required for genetic characterization that facilitate its inactivation, deletion or modification on the bacterial chromosome. in the present study, the nucleotide sequence of the escherichia coli/aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans shuttle vector pygk was determined, allowing us to redesign and construct a new shuttle cloning vector, pjt4, and promoterless lacz transcriptional/translational fusion  plasmids, pjt3 and pjt5. plasmids pjt4 and pjt5 contain the origin of replication necessary to maintain shuttle vector replication. in addition, a new suicide vector, pjt1, was constructed for the generation of scarless and markerless deletion mutations of genes in the oral pathogen a. actinomycetemcomitans. plasmid pjt1 is a puc-based suicide vector that is counter-selectable for sucrose sensitivity. this vector does not leave antibiotic markers or scars on the chromosome after gene deletion and thus provides the option to combine several mutations in the same genetic background. the effectiveness of pjt1 was demonstrated by the construction of a. actinomycetemcomitans isogenic qseb single deletion (deltaqseb) mutant and lsrrk double deletion mutants (deltalsrrk). these new vectors may offer alternatives for genetic studies in a. actinomycetemcomitans and other members of the hacek (haemophilus spp., a. actinomycetemcomitans, cardiobacterium hominis, eikenella corrodens, and kingella kingae) group of gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == effects of immunization with natural and recombinant lysine decarboxylase on canine gingivitis development.
AB  == periodontal disease, gingival inflammation (gingivitis) and periodontal attachment loss (periodontitis), causes tooth loss and susceptibility to chronic  inflammation. professionally scaling and cleaning the teeth regularly controls the disease, but is expensive in companion animals. eikenella corrodens is common in canine oral cavities where it is a source of lysine decarboxylase (ldc). in human dental biofilms (plaques), ldc converts lysine to cadaverine and impairs the gingival epithelial barrier to bacteria. ldc vaccination may therefore retard gingivitis development. year-old beagle dogs provided blood samples, and had weight and clinical measurements (biofilm and gingivitis) recorded. after scaling and cleaning, two dogs were immunized subcutaneously with 0.2mg native ldc from e. corrodens and 2 sets of four dogs with 0.2mg recombinant ldc purified from escherichia coli. a third set of 4 dogs was immunized intranasally. rehydragel((r)), emulsigen((r)), polygen or carbigen were used as adjuvant. four  additional pairs of dogs were sham-immunized with each adjuvant alone (controls). immunizations were repeated twice, 3 weeks apart, and clinical measurements were  obtained after another 2 weeks, when the teeth were scaled and cleaned again. tooth brushing was then stopped and the diet was changed from hard to soft chow.  clinical measurements were repeated after 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 weeks. compared with sham-immunized dogs, gingivitis was reduced over all 8 weeks of soft diet after subcutaneous immunization with native ldc, or after intranasal immunization with recombinant ldc in carbigen, but for only 6 of the 8 weeks after subcutaneous immunization with recombinant ldc in emulsigen((r)) (repeated measures anova). subcutaneous vaccination induced a strong serum igg antibody response that decreased during the soft diet period, whereas intranasal immunization induced a weak serum iga antibody response that did not decrease. immunization with recombinant ldc may provide protection from gingivitis if procedures are optimized.

TI  == the bacteriology of salivary gland infections.
AB  == the parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. however, infection of the salivary glands can occur in any of the glands. the most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial infection are staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. the predominant anaerobes include:  anaerobic gram negative bacilli (eg, pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas); fusobacterium spp; and peptostreptococcus spp. in addition, streptococcus spp (including streptococcus pneumoniae) and aerobic and facultative gram-negative bacilli (including escherichia coli) have been reported. aerobic and facultative  gram-negative bacilli are often seen in hospitalized patients. organisms less frequently found are haemophilus influenzae, treponema pallidum, bartonella henselae, and eikenella corrodens. mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of infection. the choice of antibiotics should be guided by identification of the etiologic agent.

TI  == the impact of the stone age diet on gingival conditions in the absence of oral hygiene.
AB  == background: the objective of this study was to assess the oral microbiota and clinical data in subjects without access to traditional oral hygiene methods and  who ate a diet available in the stone age. methods: ten subjects living in an environment replicating the stone age for 4 weeks were enrolled in this study. bleeding on probing (bop), gingival and plaque indices, and probing depth (pd) were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks. microbiologic samples were collected at the mesio-buccal subgingival aspects of all teeth and from the dorsum of the tongue and were processed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization methods. results: no subject had periodontitis. mean bop decreased from 34.8% to 12.6% (p <0.001).  mean gingival index scores changed from 0.38 to 0.43 (not statistically significant) and mean plaque scores increased from 0.68 to 1.47 (p <0.001). pd at sites of subgingival sampling decreased (mean difference: 0.2 mm; p <0.001). at week 4, the total bacterial count was higher (p <0.001) for 24 of 74 species, including bacteroides ureolyticus, eikenella corrodens, lactobacillus acidophilus, capnocytophaga ochracea, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, haemophilus influenzae, helicobacter pylori, porphyromonas endodontalis, staphylococcus aureus (two strains), streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus anginosis, and streptococcus mitis. bacterial counts from tongue samples were higher at baseline (p <0.001) for 20 species, including tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; serotype a), and streptococcus  spp. conclusions: the experimental gingivitis protocol is not applicable if the diet (e.g., stone age) does not include refined sugars. although plaque levels increased, bop and pd decreased. subgingival bacterial counts increased for several species not linked to periodontitis, whereas tongue bacterial samples decreased during the study period.

TI  == non-hacek gram-negative bacillus endocarditis.
AB  == background: infective endocarditis caused by non-hacek (species other than haemophilus species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, cardiobacterium hominis, eikenella corrodens, or kingella species) gram-negative bacilli is rare, is poorly characterized, and is commonly considered to be primarily a disease of  injection drug users. objective: to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with non-hacek gram-negative bacillus endocarditis in a large, international, contemporary cohort of patients. design: observations from  the international collaboration on infective endocarditis prospective cohort study (ice-pcs) database. setting: 61 hospitals in 28 countries. patients: hospitalized patients with definite endocarditis. measurements: characteristics of non-hacek gram-negative bacillus endocarditis cases were described and compared with those due to other pathogens. results: among the 2761 case-patients with definite endocarditis enrolled in ice-pcs, 49 (1.8%) had endocarditis (20 native valve, 29 prosthetic valve or device) due to non-hacek, gram-negative bacilli. escherichia coli (14 patients [29%]) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (11 patients [22%]) were the most common pathogens. most patients (57%) with non-hacek gram-negative bacillus endocarditis had health care-associated infection, whereas injection drug use was rare (4%). implanted endovascular devices were frequently associated with non-hacek gram-negative bacillus endocarditis compared with other causes of endocarditis (29% vs. 11%; p < 0.001). the in-hospital mortality rate of patients with endocarditis due to non-hacek gram-negative bacilli was high (24%) despite high rates of cardiac surgery (51%). limitations: because of the small number of patients with non-hacek gram-negative bacillus endocarditis in each treatment group and the lack of long-term follow-up, strong treatment recommendations are difficult to make. conclusion: in this large, prospective, multinational cohort, more than one half of all cases of non-hacek gram-negative bacillus endocarditis were associated with health care contact. non-hacek gram-negative bacillus endocarditis is not primarily a disease of injection drug users.

TI  == characterization of autoinducer 2 signal in eikenella corrodens and its role in biofilm formation.
AB  == quorum sensing (qs) is a process by which bacteria communicate using secreted chemical signaling molecules called autoinducers (ais). by this process, many bacterial species modulate the expression of a wide variety of physiological functions in response to changes in population density. in this study, the periodontal pathogen eikenella corrodens was observed to secrete type 2 signaling molecules. an ortholog of luxs, the gene required for ai-2 synthesis in vibrio harveyi, was isolated from the e. corrodens genome. a v. harveyi bioassay showed  luxs functionality in e. corrodens and the ability of luxs to complement the luxs-negative phenotype of escherichia coli dh5alpha. ai activity was detected in the supernatant, and the maximum expression of ai-2 was observed during the late  exponential phase. to determine the potential role of luxs in the colonization processes, an e. corrodens luxs mutant was constructed and tested for its capacity to form an in vitro biofilm on a polystyrene surface. the biofilm forming efficiency of the luxs mutant was approximately 1.3-fold greater than that of the wild type. these data suggest that a luxs-dependent signal plays a role in the biofilm formation by e. corrodens.

TI  == implant therapy following liver transplantation: clinical and microbiological results after 10 years.
AB  == background: the number of immunocompromised patients is increasing as a consequence of successful organ transplantation. placing dental implants in these patients has been questioned because of their increased risk for infections. the  10-year follow-up data of a 71-year-old liver transplant recipient with long-term immunosuppressive therapy is reported. six months after liver transplantation, two interforaminal implants were inserted in the edentulous mandible, and an overdenture using non-rigid telescopic attachments was fabricated 3 months later. methods: oral clinical parameters included the modified plaque index, sulcus fluid flow rate, modified bleeding index, probing depth, distance implant mucosa, attachment level, width of the keratinized mucosa and mobility values. the distance implant bone (dib) was determined on digital panoramic radiographs. the  levels of eight periodontal marker organisms were established using dna probe technology. additionally, swabs of the edentulous oral mucosa were taken for microbiological culture and antimicrobial resistance testing. results: the peri-implant parameters were within normal ranges indicating a stable osseointegration with moderate vertical bone loss. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis, campylobacter rectus, and treponema denticola were not detected. low levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and eikenella corrodens were found. prevotella intermedia was the only bacterium with a level higher than 10(4). the mucosal swabs indicated the presence of an abundant normal oral flora, including escherichia coli and candida albicans. the antibiogram revealed multiple resistance to antibiotics. conclusion: this case report suggests that immunocompromised patients can be successfully rehabilitated with dental implants.

TI  == characterization and expression of adjacent proline iminopeptidase and aspartase  genes from eikenella corrodens.
AB  == two adjacent genes involved in nitrogen metabolism from eikenella corrodens, with a potential role in pathogenesis, were studied. proline iminopeptidase (pip) activity, which may be essential for energy production and protection against host immune mechanisms, is exhibited by e. corrodens. analysis of pip-expressing  clones revealed an orf of 939 bases with a predicted amino acid sequence identity of 67% to the pip of neisseria gonorrhoea. 200 bp downstream from pip, an orf of  1395 bases, encoding a protein with 87% identity to a putative aspartase from the neisseria meningitidis genome sequence, was identified. enzymatic function was confirmed with a complemented escherichia coli aspartase deficient mutant. the e. corrodens aspartase was found to be 77% identical to the haemophilus influenzae aspartase sequence, which was originally identified on the basis of its ability to bind plasminogen. however, the e. corrodens aspartase had no such activity. southern hybridization indicated both genes to be single copy and conserved within the genomes of a diverse panel of e. corrodens isolates from health and disease.

TI  == acute bacterial suppurative parotitis: microbiology and management.
AB  == the parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. the most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial parotitis are staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. the predominant anaerobes include gram-negative bacilli (including pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp.), fusobacterium spp., and peptostreptococcus spp. streptococcus spp. (including s.  pneumoniae) and gram-negative bacilli (including escherichia coli) have also been reported. gram-negative organisms are often seen in hospitalized patients. organisms less frequently found are arachnia, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella  pneumoniae, salmonella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, treponema pallidum, cat-scratch bacillus, and eikenella corrodens. mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of parotitis. therapy includes maintenance  of hydration and administration of parenteral antimicrobial therapy. once an abscess has formed surgical drainage is required. the choice of antimicrobial depends on the etiologic agent. maintenance of good oral hygiene, adequate hydration, and early and proper therapy of bacterial infection of the oropharynx  may reduce the occurrence of suppurative parotitis.

TI  == prevalent bacterial species and novel phylotypes in advanced noma lesions.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the bacterial diversity in advanced noma lesions using culture-independent molecular methods. 16s ribosomal dna bacterial genes from dna isolated from advanced noma lesions of four nigerian children were pcr amplified with universally conserved primers and spirochetal selective primers and cloned into escherichia coli. partial 16s rrna sequences of approximately 500 bases from 212 cloned inserts were used initially to determine  species identity or closest relatives by comparison with sequences of known species or phylotypes. nearly complete sequences of approximately 1,500 bases were obtained for most of the potentially novel species. a total of 67 bacterial  species or phylotypes were detected, 25 of which have not yet been grown in vitro. nineteen of the species or phylotypes, including propionibacterium acnes,  staphylococcus spp., and the opportunistic pathogens stenotrophomonas maltophilia and ochrobactrum anthropi were detected in more than one subject. other known species that were detected included achromobacter spp., afipia spp., brevundimonas diminuta, capnocytophaga spp., cardiobacterium sp., eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium spp., gemella haemoylsans, and neisseria spp. phylotypes that were unique to noma infections included those in the genera eubacterium, flavobacterium, kocuria, microbacterium, and porphyromonas and the related streptococcus salivarius and genera sphingomonas and treponema: since advanced noma lesions are infections open to the environment, it was not surprising to detect species not commonly associated with the oral cavity, e.g., from soil. several species previously implicated as putative pathogens of noma, such as spirochetes and fusobacterium spp., were detected in at least one subject. however, due to the limited number of available noma subjects, it was not possible at this time to associate specific species with the disease.

TI  == antimicrobial effects of 2.94 microm er:yag laser radiation on root surfaces: an  in vitro study.
AB  == objectives: this in vitro study investigated the antimicrobial effects of 2.94 microm er:yag laser radiation on root surfaces. materials and methods: the study  used 125 extracted teeth which were divided into 2 groups (a, b) of 40 teeth and  3 groups of 15 teeth (c, d, e). a defined and similarly-sized area of the root surface was inoculated with an aliquot of 7 microl of a bacterial suspension of escherichia coli (atcc 25922), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (atcc 43719), eikenella corrodens (atcc 51724), or peptostreptococcus micros (atcc 33270). subsequently, the samples from each group were further divided into subgroups which have been irradiated either with 55, 75, and 105 (group a, b) or 55 and 75 (group c, d, e) laser pulses. 1 subgroup of each group was left untreated as control. the source of laser radiation was an er:yag laser emitting pulsed infrared radiation at a wavelength of 2.94 microm. the number of bacteria was determined using the surface spread plate technique. the statistical analysis was performed using anova followed by the scheffe-test.  results: depending on the number of laser pulses the bacterial load in the e. coli group was reduced by the er:yag laser radiation after exposure to 105 laser  pulses to 5.5% of the initial count and that in the staph. aureus group to 15.1%. the number of bacteria in case of a. actinomytemcomitans was reduced to 8.3%, in  case of e. corrodens to 3.0% and in case of p. micros to 22.0% after application  of 75 laser pulses. conclusion: besides the selective removal of plaque and calculus, the 2.94 microm er:yag laser radiation causes reduction in bacteria on  root surfaces.

TI  == characterization of gram-positive tellurite resistance encoded by the streptococcus pneumoniae tehb gene.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is a gram-positive bacterium which is naturally resistant to tellurite. in this study, we cloned and sequenced a homologue of the escherichia coli tellurite resistance gene tehb from s. pneumoniae. it encoded a  protein of 284 amino acids which is 86 residues longer than e. coli tehb, but similar in size to haemophilus influenzae tehb and eikenella corrodens hemagglutinin (hag1) as well as homologues from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, neisseria gonorrhoeae and neisseria meningitidis. the s. pneumoniae tehb displayed 46-58% identity (52-68% similarity) to these proteins.  the results in this study showed that the s. pneumoniae tehb alone not only conferred on e. coli high level resistance to tellurite, but also caused filamentous morphology in e. coli.

TI  == subgingival microflora in smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  == cigarette smoking is a potent risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. the objective of this study was to detect the microbial profile of early onset periodontitis in smokers and compare it to that  of non-smokers. the study population consisted of 50 systemically healthy individuals aged 25 to 38 years, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. 25 patients were smokers (> 20 cigarettes/day) and 25 non-smokers. two pooled bacterial samples comprised of four periodontal sites with probing depth > 5 mm each, were collected from each individual. the samples were cultured aerobically  and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. the differences in bacterial counts using  the mann whitney u test were statistically significant for staphylococcus aureus, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens, escherichia coli, bacteroides forsythus, bacteroides gracilis, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis,  selenomonas sputigena and candida albicans in smokers. statistically significant  differences for peptostreptococcus micros, actinomyces naeslundii, eubacterium lentum and capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in non-smokers. the isolation  of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora like e. coli, c. albicans and s. aureus in smokers microflora underscores the importance of the host which is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.

TI  == cloning, sequencing and expression of an eikenella corrodens gene encoding a component protein of the lectin-like adhesin complex.
AB  == a lectin-like substance (ls), that was isolated from eikenella corrodens (ec) 1073, migrated as proteins of about 300 and 45 kda upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. in this study, we cloned the gene encoding the 45-kda protein and predicted its structure and function. based on the n-terminal 23-amino acid (aa) sequence of this protein, we cloned the region for its n-terminus. we cloned the entire gene by means of gene walking using polymerase chain reaction and southern hybridization. the nucleotide sequences of cloned fragments revealed an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 330 aa (m(r), 35748). this orf displayed high homology  to those of porins of neisseria species. using the t7-expression system, the 45-kda protein was produced in e. coli. our results suggested that the 45-kda protein of ec 1073 is a component of the ecls complex, and that it is the major outer membrane protein.

TI  == molecular analysis of the gene encoding a protein component of the eikenella corrodens adhesin complex that is close to the carbohydrate recognition domain.
AB  == a monoclonal antibody against a lectin-like substance (ls) of eikenella corrodens (ec) was used for screening the ec dna library. three positive clones that carried an identical 12-kb segment were obtained. a 25-kda protein, which specifically binds to the antibody, was overproduced in all of the escherichia coli clones. deletion analysis showed that the gene encoding the 25-kda protein was located within a 1.2-kb segment. the nucleotide (nt) sequence of this segment contained an open reading frame encoding a protein of 24600 da. we purified the 25-kda protein from the cloned e. coli strain. the sequence of the first 10 amino acids(aa) from the n-terminus of the purified 25-kda protein agreed with that deduced from the nt sequence. since the monoclonal antibody used in this study inhibits the physiological activity of ecls, we concluded that the 25-kda protein is a component of the adhesin complex, which is located near the carbohydrate recognition domain of lectin in ecls.

TI  == comparison of the pro-inflammatory cytokine-stimulating activity of the surface-associated proteins of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == saline extraction of the periodontopathic bacterium, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, releases surface-associated material (sam), a complex mixture of proteins and carbohydrates with potent biological actions on isolated  bone and on various mammalian cell populations. in this study, the relative ability of the sam from 5 organisms, implicated in the pathology of periodontal disease, to stimulate human mesenchymal and myelomonocytic cells to synthesize the proinflammatory cytokines - interleukin (il)-1 beta, il-6 and tumour necrosis factor (tnf)alpha has been investigated. the bacteria investigated were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and campylobacter rectus. human cells were exposed to a four log order range of concentrations of the sam, or of escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, to provide full agonist dose responses in order to allow comparison of the potency and efficacy of each sam. all sams demonstrated the capacity to stimulate human gingival fibroblasts (hgfs), human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) or the myelomonocytic cell line - mono-mac-6 to release one or all of the cytokines assayed. activity was heat- and trypsin-sensitive suggesting that the active components were proteinaceous. however, there were substantial differences in the potency and efficacy of each sam when compared on  a concentration basis (w/v). the most active sam was from a. actinomycetemcomitans with those from e. corrodens and p. gingivalis being slightly less active. the least active cytokine-stimulating sams were from c. rectus and pr. intermedia. one major difference between the sams and e. coli lps  was the inability of the former to stimulate hgfs to release il-1 beta or tnf alpha although they could stimulate pbmcs to release these cytokines. this may have relevance to the pathology of the periodontal diseases.

TI  == sequence divergence in two tandemly located pilin genes of eikenella corrodens.
AB  == eikenella corrodens normally inhabits the human respiratory and gastrointestinal  tracts but is frequently the cause of abscesses at various sites. using the n-terminal portion of the moraxella nonliquefaciens pilin gene as a hybridization probe, we cloned two tandemly located pilin genes of e. corrodens 31745, ecpc and ecpd, and expressed the two pilin genes separately in escherichia coli. a comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences of e. corrodens 31745 ecpc and ecpd revealed considerable divergence between the sequences of these two pilins and even less similarity to ecpa and ecpb of e. corrodens type strain atcc 23834. ecpc from e. corrodens 31745 displayed high degrees of homology to the pilins of  neisseria gonorrhoeae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. ecpd from e. corrodens 31745 showed the highest homologies with the pilin of one of the three p. aeruginosa classes, whereas ecpa and ecpb of strain atcc 23834 most closely resemble moraxella bovis pilins. these findings raise interesting questions about potential genetic transfer between different bacterial species, as opposed to convergent evolution.

TI  == cloning, characterization and sequencing of two haemagglutinin genes from eikenella corrodens.
AB  == eikenella corrodens is emerging as an important human pathogen, in both extra-oral and periodontal infections. from a clone bank of eikenella corrodens chromosomal dna produced in escherichia coli jm109, twenty-two clones expressed eikenella antigens and of these, two expressed functional haemagglutinins. by virtue of different restriction maps and a lack of homology by southern hybridization, the two cloned fragments encoding the two haemagglutinins have been shown to be distinct. maxicell analysis revealed that clone 1, carrying plasmid pvkr201, produces three eikenella proteins, one of 31.5 kda and two of approximately 14 kda each. expression of each of the proteins appears to be under the control of an eikenella promoter(s). clone 2, carrying plasmid pvkr301, produces two proteins, one of 93 kda and the second of 17 kda. expression of both of these proteins in e. coli requires the lac promoter in the vector. by preparing a series of subclones and testing each by maxicell analysis and for haemagglutination activity, a functional map of the insert of clone 1 was deduced and the 31.5 kda polypeptide identified as the haemagglutinin. using similar methods, the 17 kda protein was found to be the haemagglutinin of clone 2. the nucleotide sequences of both haemagglutinin genes were determined and are presented. computer analysis revealed no homology between the two haemagglutinins, and no homology to any previously sequenced proteins. these are  the first genes of this genus to be cloned and sequenced.

AB  == recent studies have demonstrated that the 5' leader (omega sequence) of tobacco mosaic virus rna has a certain enhancing capacity for translation of mrna in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. in order to estimate the efficiency of omega to initiate translation of mrna in escherichia coli, in comparison to the shine-dalgarno (s/d) sequence, we have inserted eight different eukaryotic genes  into two types of e. coli expression vectors containing one constitutive promoter (p1) but different translation-initiation sites (s/d or omega delta 3 sequence, respectively). the efficiency of transcription and translation in vivo was evaluated for these vectors by measuring the yield of protein and both the level  and stability of mrna. we report that substitution of omega delta 3 for s/d decreases the yield of expressed protein 4-1900-fold and the content of gene-specific mrna is decreased by about sevenfold. however, in comparison with the s/d sequence, the level of protein expressed under the translational control  of omega delta 3 is less sensitive to changes in the 5' coding region. we also report that the omega sequence contains a region of 10-12 nucleotides complementary to the small ribosomal subunit rna (rrna) of e. coli, eikenella corrodens and xenopus laevis, and to the rrna of the (small ribosomal) subunit of oryza sativa.

TI  == identification of a streptomycin resistance gene and a partial tn3 transposon coding for a beta-lactamase in a periodontal strain of eikenella corrodens.
AB  == the beta-lactamase gene from a periodontal strain of eikenella corrodens, resistant to penicillins and streptomycin, was inserted into pbgs9 and transformed into escherichia coli dh5 alpha. a 4.7-kb insert of pjml1, one of the transformants, was partially sequenced and found to contain the right section of  transposon tn3 from the middle of the tnpr resolvase gene to the right inverted repeat ri(r), including the tem-1 gene. sequences identical to rsf1010 were found on either side of the tn3 sequence. pjml1 also contained a streptomycin resistance gene, probably identical to that of rsf1010. a portion of the pjml1 insert was not homologous to either tn3 or rsf1010 but was homologous to the chromosomal dna of e. corrodens atcc 23834. it is assumed that the insert of pjml1 was derived from the chromosomal dna of e. corrodens ec-38.

TI  == adherence to experimental pellicle of rough-type lipopolysaccharides from subgingival plaque bacteria.
AB  == the adherence of lipopolysaccharides (lpss) from periodontal disease-associated bacteria to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (s-ha) and serum-coated ha beads was examined by chromogenic limulus activity (toxicolor test). phenol-water extracted lps preparations from bacteroides intermedius, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, and rough-type lps from escherichia coli adhered to s-ha and serum-coated beads and agglutinated human erythrocytes. the adhered lpss to s-ha and serum-coated ha beads were not removed by vigorous washing with distilled water. lpss from bacteroides (porphyromonas) gingivalis strains and wild-type e. coli did not adhere to s-ha,  serum-coated ha beads or show hemagglutinating activity. sds-page patterns stained with silver stain showed that lpss adhered to s-ha, and serum-coated ha beads and erythrocytes possessed a distinct fast-migrating band similar to rough-type lps. b. gingivalis lpss possessed slow-migrating and repeating ladder  bands similar to wild-type lps.

TI  == killing of oral, gram-negative, facultative bacteria by the rabbit defensin, np-1.
AB  == oral, gram-negative, facultative bacteria, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga spp. have been associated with destructive periodontal infection. neutrophils play a critical role in defending the periodontium against destructive infection. defensins are antimicrobial peptides that have been isolated in human, rabbit, guinea pig, and  rat leukocytes that may constitute an important nonoxidative mechanism of killing. the purpose of this study was to examine the sensitivity of a battery of oral, gram-negative, facultative bacteria to the bactericidal effects of the isolated rabbit peptide np-1. all species tested were killed by np-1; however, there was strain-to-strain variation in sensitivity. the bactericidal effect was  not dependent on net bacterial growth, although metabolic activity was evident as assessed by bacterial oxygen consumption. we conclude that bacteria are sensitive to the cidal mechanism involved in defensin-mediated bacterial killing and that the conditions of this assay system support the killing of bacteria by the defensin peptides.

TI  == aerobic bacteria cultured from the mouth of the american opossum (didelphis virginiana) with reference to bacteria associated with bite infections.
AB  == the american opossum inflicts bite injuries both when hunted for food and when accidentally provoked when handled in captivity. this study involved aerobically  culturing organisms from the mouths of seven wild opossums (didelphis virginiana). isolates included streptococci, coagulase-positive and -negative staphylococci, aeromonas spp., citrobacter freundii, eikenella corrodens, and escherichia coli.

TI  == protection of mice against the lethal toxicity of a lipopolysaccharide (lps) by immunization with anti-idiotype antibody to a monoclonal antibody to lipid a from eikenella corrodens lps.
AB  == we produced anti-idiotype antibodies to antibody to lipid a from eikenella corrodens. the ala-1 monoclonal antibody (immunoglobulin m [igm] isotype), which  had already been produced in our laboratory (t. kato, i. takazoe, and k. okuda, infect. immun. 57:656-659, 1989), had reacted strongly with lipid a from e. corrodens, escherichia coli, and salmonella minnesota. four anti-idiotype monoclonal antibodies to ala-1 (ab1), designated a2la-1 (igg1 isotype), a2la-2 (igg2a isotype), a2la-3 (igg2a isotype), and a2la-4 (igg3 isotype), which recognized the idiotype ab1, were produced. a2la-1, a2la-2, and a2la-3 were capable of over 61% inhibition of ala-1 reactivity to e. coli j5 lipid a in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system. the sera of mice and rabbits immunized  with the anti-idiotype antibodies revealed that the internal image anti-idiotype  antibody induced the production of igg antibodies that cross-reacted with or bound to lipid a. these studies indicate that a2la-1 and a2la-2 contained an antigenic epitope that mimicked lipid a. immunization of mice with a2la-1 resulted in prevention of lethal toxicity from e. coli j5 lipopolysaccharide.

TI  == comparative study of some biological activities of porins extracted from various  microorganisms.
AB  == the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria contains some major proteins, called porins, with particular chemical and physical characteristics which reflect some  specialized functions peculiar to the outer membrane. in recent years the biological properties of salmonella typhimurium sh5014 porins have been the focus of our experimental studies. the aim of the present research was to make a comparative investigation of the biological activities of porins extracted from other microorganisms classified in the enterobacteriaceae, together with a taxonomically different one, eikenella corrodens frequently isolated from gum pockets of patients with periodontal disease. porins from e. coli k12, proteus mirabilis and eikenella corrodens were extracted, purified and separated from lps by means of phenol extraction. the purity of preparation was checked by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in slabs. we studied the interactions of these proteins with some cellular and humoral systems within the  host. mouse peritoneal macrophages in the presence of these proteins show morphological and functional modifications, depending upon the type of porins and the concentrations used. the ability of porins to interact with the complement system was investigated in vitro. a pool of sera from 20 blood donors served as a source of human complement. the results obtained with porins of various sources were shown comparatively.

TI  == tobramycin and cephalothin for treatment of suspected sepsis in neutropenic children with cancer.
AB  == the safety and efficacy of tobramycin and cephalothin in treatment of suspected sepsis were studied in neutropenic children with various malignancies. twenty episodes of suspected sepsis in 19 febrile children with cancer were treated with parenteral tobramycin and cephalothin; the duration of therapy ranged from one to 80 days. in 14 of the 20 episodes of suspected sepsis, a favorable clinical response was achieved within five days after initiation of antibiotic therapy. these episodes included a urinary tract infection with proteus mirabilis and sepsis due to escherichia coli. in four of the additional six episodes, clinical  deterioration was though to be caused by the underlying malignancies. two episodes included a case of e. coli spesis that ended fatally and a nosocomial infection with eikenella corrodens. results of this study suggest that combination therapy with tobramycin and cephalothin is safe and efficacious in treatment of suspected sepsis in febrile children with malignancies and neutropenia.
